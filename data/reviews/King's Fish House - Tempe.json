{"text":"I'm no seafood aficionado, but this place seemed pretty good to me, and I hope it sticks around because fresh seafood like this (and at these prices) is fairly unusual here in the desert. Our table tried the fish and chips, swordfish, seafood kebab and catfish -- and all were satisfied. As noted in other reviews, the staff is jovial and the atmosphere is pleasant. Whew -- saves me a trip to Boston!"}
{"text":"I am rather picky about my seafood and was surprised by some of the negative reviews of this place; so I decided to give it a try. The ambiance inside was a bit cold so we ate outside (pleasant) and the service was excellent. The food did not disappoint. The grilled artichoke and crab cakes were wonderful appetizers and our group ordered the Mahi Mahi, Tilapia and sea bass. All were flavorful, cooked perfectly and included pretty good accompaniments (i.e. fresh spinach, cheesy grits, garlic mashed, etc.). Their menu offers a huge variety including fresh oysters, a nice selection of salads, and lobster. And for the non fish eater, there are sandwiches, chicken, pasta and steaks. They also offer a very nice list of beer and wine. For a restaurant in Arizona that specializes in fish, King's is a pretty good place. I would go again."}
{"text":"Our server was awesome!! Food was lacking flavor. We ordered calamari as our appetizer and it was good, but the sauces were terrible. I ordered the lemon nut crusted sea bass and it had no flavor at all. My husband ordered the scallops blackened, but they were actually just Cajun scallops. Overall the experience was ok, but not worth the price."}
{"text":"Four of us went to dinner here and two of us had to send our cold dinner back. The menu has changed from what it was before. They used to have a better selection and now the food had much to be desired . Too bad...the coconut shrimp they used to have was great.  We won't be going back soon at those prices.   J and K"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a couple drinks and dinner with a work friend of mine recently on a Wednesday night.  The place wasn't packed, and we sat inside at the bar.  The mussels were ok, and the salmon sushi roll was better than I expected - considering it's in the desert and a regional chain.  It's in a unique spot in Tempe marketplace, and I knew parking would not be easy, but I didn't care.  I found the service to be very good and helpful.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place for bivalves. I've dropped about about two hundred bucks on oysters there and have never been disappointed with one of them. Sitting at the bar (go figure) I like to start with a Stella and a dozen huge slurpers with some hot sauce. When a few friends show up we move on to the crabcakes and crab legs.  After a few more Stellas and few more friends we do oyster shooters till Lindsey cuts us off. Of the oysters, I mean.  Apparently their labor costs were getting a little out of hand with our group ordering so many. I love this place for the food and the good service. A definite must at the Marketplace."}
{"text":"Great place, for some reason i don't think it is ever really that busy though which i guess is a good thing if you are trying to snag a table quick. The wait staff were really helpful and friendly and knowledgeable on everything they offered up.    The only reason they don't get Five stars is because we ordered the Thresher Shark and they were out, so he offered another dish in place of it, but he pulled a sneaky quick one when the meal we got in place of it was more than double the price of the shark.... lol"}
{"text":"We are restaurant connoisseurs...we try all different types of places and have our favorites...mostly seafood fares.   So we were excited to learn of the Kings Fish House and the wonderful menu. We decided to try dinner last Saturday and to make a long story short, we were disappointed.   We rate restaurants for our overall experience, not just the food. And unfortunately, this place delivered neither. Our server, to put it mildly, was very curt and not helpful with understanding the menu. It seemed like we were a bother to him, eating at his station. Awful service. Now to the meals...everything was was over cooked...for a seafood restaurant, you would figure they would know how to cook it...not the case. It was a shame to have over cooked clams, King Crab legs and lobster...chewy, ALL of it. Even the rice was over cooked...really?! Again, too bad...giving this place 1 star for convenience of location....that's it."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for what they give you, and they will get your order wrong.  I had a craving for clam chowder and called around, found out they had it, and placed an order for pick-up. I asked for crackers with my chowder, just to be sure, and they assured me that they'd put that with my order. My husband asked for fish and chips.  When I get there to pick it up and got a look at the receipt I almost fainted. They charged $18 for the fish and chips; the cup of clam chowder was $7 and when I got the bag home and opened it up, it was on the small side for a cup. There were also NO crackers for my clam chowder. The pieces of fish were rather big, but not big enough to warrant spending $18."}
{"text":"Our first visit here was mostly a pleasant experience.  I had the Yellow Tail Tuna, spinach, and rosemary potatoes.  My gf had Fish and Chips.  We shared a bottle of Riesling.  It was very busy on the Saturday night we went, so instead of sitting out the one hour wait we decided on eating at the bar.  The fish was terrific and fresh--I understand it's shipped in same day from Los Angeles.  I felt the \"chips\" part of the Fish and Chips were kinda lame given the price of the meal.  Also, occasionally a really nasty odor wafted in--I think maybe a sewer smell from outdoors coming in through the open windows.  That only happened a couple of times & I wouldn't expect that to be the general experience for people eating here.  Altogether a good eating experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a couple of times and we loved it.  I continually ordered the shrimp po'boy and it was great.  There mac and cheese is definiately good!!  We enjoyed this place so much that we decided to bring some friends for dinner because they had never been to this resturant.  Our dinner was expensive and was not worth the money.  I do not mind spending money if the meal is worth it.  I ordered a rare filet with lobster.  The filet was extremely rare, it was as if they left it on the grill just to brown the outsides.  The inside was cold it was so rare.  The lobster was chewy and difficult to eat.  It was later at night so idk if they stopped putting effort in cooking and wanted to get out of work or what.  Our wait staff was very friendly though.  On a good note, there sourdough bread is very good."}
{"text":"We've been here twice and on both occasions the service and food were excellent.  Our server, Chris, was phenomenal and provided us with excellent recommendations for fresh oysters and our entrees.  We ordered the halibut, trout almondine and yellowtail.  We didn't have the tiniest morsel left on our plates."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at King's, and I have to say it was exceptional. Great recommendations from our server Ashley P. The ceviche is perfect, you can tell the fish is very fresh. Grilled Artichoke is wonderful, and we tried the lobster crunchy roll, I'll say their sushi very good, as well. I will definitely be back to try a proper dinner entree."}
{"text":"Great atomosphere, great food, great service. At our table we had the salmon, yellowtail, sand dabs, and scallops. Scallops & Sand dabs were out of this world. We're all on diets so we passed on the big yummy looking load of sourdough bread. (ahhh bread). Our server was cute, he offered to bring us Rye because I told him we were all on diets.  I dont usually get geeked up about salad dressing, but the basil vingeratte was really good! The sand dabs looked more like Patrole sole & had a yummy lemon caper sauce & my scallops were perfect."}
{"text":"Granted with a seafood menu that changes daily, due to availability, it certainly is a fine find for Phoenix.  However we had some mixed reviews.  We both had the spicy seafood chowder.  It was extremely good with plenty of seafood, had a nice favorful taste but not necessarily \"spicy\", but that's our taste and we would most definitely order it again.  Just don't be put off by the \"spicy\" label.  The bread is awesome.  I had the Ahi tuna and my partner had the whaoo.  Perhaps it was simply an off day but the tuna they served me was full of membrane (grizzle).  Out waiter saw the piece after he served it and was very quick to remove and replace it.  The sauce that accompanied it was tasteless and couldn't figure out what it was or suppose to be.  I had to request wasabi which typically always comes with ahi. The garlic mashed potato's were a garlic lovers dream.  Now to the wahoo.  We were surprised to see it offered in the desert as we always order it when on the Yucatan.  If you haven't had the pleasure it is a firm white fish with a distinct taste.  Unfortunately, this piece was overcooked and thus dry.    So perhaps an off day for the kitchen and with that much fresh fish combined with the length of time they have been in operation, we will definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"My family and I had a wonderful dining experience. The food was very tasty and fresh. The waitstaff/ manager were very friendly and informative. The oysters were AWESOME!!!! The prices were fare. I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"We are all the way from Reno, and they have great food they have there seafood delivered every couple days and they print there menu twice daily and thats how fresh there food is depending on what is they het shipped is that's on the menu, they have great service we had Jeremy and Stephen (the gray haired kid) as our server, they we're implacable they gave wonderful service and very knowledgeable on how, when, and where there food is coming from and how it's prepared."}
{"text":"Exceptional food and service! Good good good amazing. Like sugar and spice and everything nice Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum"}
{"text":"Why is this Kings still open ? I have being going to kings for 4/5 years and the only reason I keep going back is because I always forget how bad it is .  the food sucks  the service sucks  the management sucks   Hey Mr King shut her down ! Your staff don't care and your hemorrhaging money . Cut your losses and call it a day ."}
{"text":"We came here for our wedding anniversary last Fall and were very disappointed. My parents love this place in Southern CA, so they recommended we eat here in Tempe. The waiter didn't seem to know much about the menu and wasn't able to offer really good advice. He just would say everything was \"really good.\" He also seemed to take occasional smoke breaks, because he would come back to our table wreaking of cigarettes and stink up the whole area. It was extremely unappetizing to smell that odor throughout our dinner. Every time he'd come back to the table, the smell of like wet musty cigs just kind of lingered in the air and my husband and I would look at each other. In addition to that, the food was bland. I ordered steamed mussels and they really didn't offer any kind of good broth. I also ordered a white fish off their most popular menu thinking that I couldn't go wrong and it was completely bland. My husband thought his meal was decent. We both agreed we would never go back to King's Fish House when we want to eat a nice seafood meal."}
{"text":"I got into a seafood kick and convinced a coworker to tag along. There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of non fast-food seafood places in Tempe. Google Maps pointed out King's Fish House.  The menu looks amazing. However lunch during the work week isn't the time to crack shells or have a food coma over an over indulgence. I had fried oysters on the brain and seriously considered several of the 7 or so different raw oysters (the Tempe menu is a little different from the one online).  We started with the fried oyster appetizer. The 5-6 pieces were lightly deep fried and were really oily. The breading didn't have a chance to stay on for very long but the oysters themselves were very tasty. The cocktail sauce was light and the tartar sauce was average. The spicy garlic sauce in a bottle at the table added a little nice kick.  Coworker ordered the skewered scallops and shrimp. They were overcooked. A scallop was cut in half with a fork and it sprung back into place like rubber. The shrimp was dry even with half the shell still on it. The blackened 5-6oz Atlantic salmon (Farmed Cypress Island Salmon) was half good and half very dry and overcooked. A few minutes after ordering, I had a feeling I should have ordered the swordfish. However it was seasoned well, was tasty and had a nice charred flavor to it. The grilled zucchini was very good. But again only half of the very unevenly sliced pieces were grilled - the ungrilled pieces were a bit undercooked (not really that big of a deal) and seemed to have missed all of the seasoning, too. The creamy-looking garlic mashed potatoes looked as if they were plain but had the perfect amount of garlic flavor to it.  There was a little bit of a wait between drinks/appetizer and the main dishes but the service was very good and our server was very attentive. The restaurant is spacious with high ceilings and gave it a roomy feeling.  I've noticed that this place seems to be evenly hit and miss with Yelpers (+grain of salt). The oyster selection will bring me back for another go but having all of our main dishes overcooked was really disappointing."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice but the the food was disappointing. My husband ordered fish and chips and I ordered the fried shrimp. 3 of my shrimp tasted pretty good but the last 3 pieces smelled and tasted very fishy, almost like they were unclean. Couldn't finish it. Also got the Mac and cheese for a side and some of the noodles were undercooked but overall has a decent taste. My husbands fish was disgusting. So greasy and soggy and also had a strange unclean fish smell and taste. His side of fries were good though but unfortunately he couldn't even finish his $18 plate. So unless you plan on just eating sides for dinner I'd stay clear of fried fish and shrimp. Here's hoping neither one of us gets sick. Definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Thank god i had a gift certificate with this dump! Food was bland,.no taste, salad was small, for the price, nothing special about this place,.generic facade of a seafood place,.dont waste your money!!"}
{"text":"If you live near fresh water (San Francisco, Seattle) don't eat fish here. Everything - EVERYTHING is frozen. Sand dab, no, - scallops - no, prawns eh, no- even frying it didn't help. just don't eat fish in AZ.  Veggies are good  Wait staff is good Mojito was GREAT - not a mix"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at Kings Fish House. The food is awesome but the service from Mike Smiley is what keeps me coming back. He is awesome!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last night for a belated birthday dinner and I felt like we made a good choice. Our server, Katelyn, was fantastic. I had multiple questions about the menu and she answered every question with a smile and gave us some great recommendations. We started with the grilled artichoke which was messy and delicious and exactly how I like my food. I ordered the swordfish tacos and loved how colorful they were. These were a little messy as well but delicious. My boyfriend ordered the sea scallops with carrots and spinach as his sides. He cleared his plate. We took a look at the dessert menu but decided we were too full to have dessert. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service was decent, fish was dry and not very tasty. $100 for a couple definitely not worth it , fish and chips were mainly all batter and dripping with oil . Contacted us within a week sent us a $50 gift card haven't used it yet but will give this place a second chance for sure ,,,,,moving them up a star for that...."}
{"text":"On our first trip to Tempe Marketplace we decided to dine at King's Fish House as me and my wife rarely get to eat fish with an 8 year old in tow, but their kids menu seemed adequate, so we decided to say.  We started with the Clam Chowder which was flavorful, but the portion was small, which turned out to be a theme throughout the night.  My wife and I split the Blackened Mahi Mahi with Mango salsa along with Jasmine rice and Glazed carrots. I won't argue with the price of a good meal, but our portions were really small for the price. The rice had only a hit of Jasmine, and the carrots were underdone. The fish was very good, but again I was put off by the portion size.  For dessert we had Strawberry Shortcake, and while the \"cake\" was good, size was again a problem as the shortcake wasn't much larger than a half-dollar.  Our waiter was inattentive as we had to ask for drinks and bread several times, and he didn't seem very knowledgeable about the menu.  Overall the food was good, but there was nothing special about the experience at all, and there is not much value based on the portion size. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great. Brittany did an awesome job... Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best oyster bar in AZ....Kaylin our server was very knowledgeable about the food and had a great attitude. Ashley the manager was amazing as well. Our first time dining experience was fantastic, food was top notch. We will definitely be back... a must try"}
{"text":"On this Friday night we found it to be busy with a 20 minute wait but it was well worth it. This place is the best seafood place around. Great huge menu, friendly staff. Delicous food!  Husband had the Fish and Chips which he said was exceptional and I had Linguini with Clams, which I have to say was the best meal I've had in ages. Just perfect. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Hi worst New Years Meal ever, slow service , remake drink3 times, rude manager, incorrect check."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm fron Orange County, California and seafood is a staple for me. King's was a definite go to restaurant even when I lived close to the coast. It simply cannot be beat. Now imagine that freshness and quality in the middle of a desert at a place that only uses their freezer for ice cream.... Yeah, super fresh and super tasty. We started with the dozen sampler of oysters which was phenomenal. We then had the house salad and the AMAZING sourdough bread and butter. Let me just tell you, I could have had the bread, salad, and oysters and called it a day and been happy. For the main course my girlfriend had the filet and lobster tail and I had the linguini with clams. You simply cannot do better than this. King's is the King. The staff is super polite, friendly, and speedy. The general manager even came out to make sure we were doing well. Best place to go for a high quality meal that will never let you down!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here on Wednesday (1/22/2014) with my daughter for dinner.  Service was very good but our waiter was not up to speed on their menu or seafood.  Daughter had the sea bass that was not fresh but should have been for the price. My sea scallops were not sea scallops but appeared to be small bay scallops and were definitely frozen and chewy.  Will write this place off the list as a good place to eat."}
{"text":"I had dinner and drinks there tonight with friends. I had the ahi tuna which was very good and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals as well. The cosmopolitans were fabulous. The only downside was that they had the bar window wide open and it was freezing in the restaurant tonight.  $100 for the 3 off us."}
{"text":"Our server was Jeremy. He was just terrific! He made sure our meal flowed in a way that everything was the right temperature and was so enjoyable because of it. Great food with amazing service.. You have to try it!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was fast & the atmosphere was nice. We are surely enjoyed our first time here.  I recommend trying the HOT n' SPICY POKE TUNA !! so BOMB !!"}
{"text":"Large group - been here since about 7. Food finally coming out after 9:00. Amazingly, there was only 1 server for about 25 people. Maybe it will get better now that they've closed!  Let's see if any of the staff stick around for this group.  From what I've seen, I doubt it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Kings Fish House tonight with my family. The food was amazing and our service was outstanding. Our waiter, Brian, was excellent, very attentive and had great recommendations for us. It is apparent that he is very knowledgeable about seafood and the immense options at Kings. We enjoyed the overall experience and will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Had the Mahi Mahi with spinach and carrots.  Their southwest salad is incredible. Corn, tortilla chips, beans with a chipotle based dressing was a meal by itself."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, wonderful service. Our waiter Andrew is the best!! We especially love the Chipotle ranch dressing and the shrimp taquitos.  Next time we promise to get dessert!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I came here for lunch. I had the salmon salad and it was delicious! The service was quick and waiter was very nice and never let our drinks reach the bottom. Once you sit down they bring a sourdough bread which is delicious and dangerous if your watching your bread intake! The only thing I would point out is that there are two entrances one is for the bar and the other the main entrance. We walked in through the oyster bar entrance which wasn't bad it's just that when we did this we had to walk through the restaurant to get to the hostess. Other than that this place knows it's seafood!"}
{"text":"I came here today with my mom for our mother-daughter shopping day. I saw the prices and kind of freaked. Not gonna lie, I was a little worried. I ordered the lemon nut sea bass with the Mac n cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. My mom got the clam linguine. We both fell in love. The Mac and cheese... I can't even describe it. It was amazing. Even my mom was blown away. We left there with full tummies, and a little buzzed. Would definitely come back. Maybe I'll bring the boyfriend here soon. Either way, I'm getting the sea bass."}
{"text":"Ordered a large sushi platter. Worst sushi my Fiancé and I have ever had. Tasted old and was not fresh at all. Almost as if they thawed frozen fish to make the rolls. Also ridiculously over priced menu for farmed fish. Can't speak for other items on the menu as this was our first time here. Service was good."}
{"text":"Great food on a perfect day to sit outside at the bar with outstanding service from Amanda! We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place a bunch of times going to Tempe Marketplace and from the outside it looked like a cool place that was worth a try. I went with a work group and we got crab cakes and calamari as an appetizer that were decent. I ordered the trout, which was just okay, it was quite plain tasting, not much flavor. I can't really say too much good about this place, its nothing special, it acts like a step up from Red Lobster, but its really not. At least Red Lobster has great smoothies and cheddary biscuits."}
{"text":"Wasn't very impressed with the food. Service mediocre. My sister had the tuna very bland they didn't give me the right side dish. For the price I think we will find a different place for fish."}
{"text":"I was taken to King's Fish House for my birthday by my wife and daughter.  We were wanting to try a place we had not been before.  Since we live in NW Glendale we were hoping King's would be better than average.  It was.  Oysters were great... not too fishy and a great assortment of sides with it.  Even tried some tuna sushi.  Courses went from scallops to macadamia crusted halibut to N'awlins shrimp.  5 drinks between us and a couple appetizers as well as a couple of deserts.  We requested to be seated outside (it was really nice outside) but no one was out there and it was a Wednesday night... makings for disastrous wait staff problems.  But we had a great waiter who came just the perfect amount of times even though we were \"out of the way\".  So... It's a 30 mile trek for us... and we won't go back all the time but we will go back when we want a great seafood restaurant!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos were delish.   The lobster bisque was awful.   It had a poor after taste, too sweet, and was missing any noticeable lobster.  We splurged on the diets with the sourdough bread and while I feel guilty on one hand the other was happy because the bread was yummy."}
{"text":"Perfect Sunday lunch.  That's not a bad way to start a review I think.  We went here last Sunday right before going to the movies.  We ordered the Cold Seafood Combo; it was crab legs, peel-n-eat shrimp, clams and oysters. Plenty of food for 2 people.  It was a really slow there but that's fine by me.  The beer was very good and cold. For the meal for 2, plus we each had 2 beers...it was only about $50.   We spoke to the manager and he gave us a coupon for next months Lobsterfest, buy one lobster get one free.  So of course we'll be back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly decent variety and quality of seafood for a chain restaurant. I've had several business lunches here and it hit the mark. The service tends to be substandard similar to what you'd expect from a chili's waiter making near the poverty line and being forced to wear an obnoxious amount of flair."}
{"text":"King's is a great experience.  The food is fresh, well prepared, comes in a good portion size, and is served by attentive staff.  I even enjoy the decor of the restaurant; it fits the bill quite well.  I'm not saying it's the best fish house ever, but considering the somewhat reasonable prices, it's a safe bet."}
{"text":"Freshest fish around and friendly staff too.  I worked for these guys many moons ago and can tell you they defintely go out of their way to serve the freshest seafood you'll find."}
{"text":"I've tried several times to eat oysters and it has ended poorly each time. My dad is a huge fan and he prefers to fry them. Still, I'd heard that some people eat them raw and have wanted to try them that way for a while. It was an adventure for both of us, but my dad and I shared an order of raw oysters. That is some of the best food the sea has to offer.  In addition to the oysters of which we ordered another plate, I also tried the clam chowder and loved that as well. This place is pretty pricey, but good seafood in Arizona is hard to come by. I will return for another plate of raw oysters as soon as I can."}
{"text":"I had grilled Mexican (Baja California) Yellowfin Tuna (rare) with garlic sauteed spinach and grilled zucchini. Very Good!!  Great setting, service was good.    I others in my party really liked theirs too, they had halibut."}
{"text":"This place is not worth the price. I ordered the shrimp louie salad entree which lacked any flavor at all. I expected that I would get nice large shrimp only it was a pile of tiny cold, boring shrimp on top of a plate full of lettuce with large hunks of unseasoned raw veggies. I took a few bites and then just stopped eating it. I am a person that loves salads, they can be made healthy and flavorful when done well, but this one is something I could have thrown together at home myself. When our server saw my salad not eaten, he simply asked if I was finished but didn't even ask if I enjoyed it. Clearly I did not enjoy it since I took only 3 or 4 bites.  My boyfriend ordered the smoked salmon tortellini which actually tasted fine, however the price was high and there was only a small amount of salmon in the dish. It was more of a pasta with cream sauce and a little bit of salmon thrown in for flavor. We each had one drink from the bar and the bill came to $50.00.  The best thing here was the sourdough bread, however I expected them to ask if we wanted more bread after we finished the first piece on our table and they did not ask if we wanted more. Personally I don't mind not getting more bread because I don't like to overeat it, however I think they should at least ask if we would like more. Overall, the food was so-so but the main thing is that the prices were shockingly high for the quality of the food we received. In my opinion the food, atmosphere, and service was not worth it."}
{"text":"Just ate there. Had an awesone meal. Sat on patio and enjoyed the beautiful weather. LEVI WAS A SUPERB WAITPERSON. He was informed about the menu and made great recommendations. Will go back soon."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner recently.  It was a horrible hot day. So I wanted to go out after being out of town all week. We went in the bar entrance. The bartender sat us in the restaurant ,but where he could see us in the bar. He was our waiter,which was fine until he got busy. M's Fish dinner had to be sent back because it was just not that good and incredibly salty. They did make him another one which came out much better. It was not the worst fish I have ever had, but not the best either.  Maybe because, it is Phoenix and I am comparing it with other cities. But, sad to say I am not a fan. However, the corn was really good. I am not a corn eater normally, but it was cut fresh off the corn and was really good.  The reason I am giving 5 stars is the dessert. It was such good Key lime Pie! I mean really good. They say they make it right there in the restaurant! It tasted just like what I had in The Keys! Who would ever think that you would go for fish and love the dessert instead, but it happened. This is a place I would go to in the future for dessert for sure, the seafood is better than Red Lobster, but that is not saying much. Because, I cannot say I would ever go to a Red Lobster ever again. I might go back here though. Maybe we just need to give it another try.   I thought the cocktail napkins were really cute. The menus are printed up every day so that would indicate they maybe just had a bad fish day. Bathrooms were clean and the parking is easy."}
{"text":"King's Fish House is the incarnation of \"average\" in my book.  I ended up here for lunch with a handful of co-workers last week because we put the lunch option up to a vote, and this was the compromise spot.  This place isn't great, but it isn't horrible.  I'd never come here again of my own volition, but if I ended up here for some reason beyond my control, I'd find something on the menu that wouldn't suck.  As far as chain fish joints in Phoenix go, this is not nearly as good as say ... Kincaid's ... but it's far better than Joe's Crab Shack.  And that, in a nutshell, is why I give this place three stars."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for my birthday, there was about 15 of us. The food was great, service was great, and the prices not so great... I guess that comes along with great food and seafood! I recommend this place, at least to try it. We went on a Sunday evening and it wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here last night. The cedar plank salmon was wonderful. Had a chance to taste the halibut, one encrusted in hazel nut and one simply grilled, both were top notch. Add to all this fine food, a fantastic server, Ash and you have a great night out. As a visitor to Temper Arizona, I was pleasantly surprised to find such a good  seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"I was there 2 days ago for 630 dinner on a Friday. Tempe Market very busy because of Xmas shopping. I had a crab Louie salad and a local beer on tap. Others ordered the Ono and crab cakes and rock fish. Dishes were nicely made. Fish tasted fresh. Could actually carry on a conversation, which I always greatly value."}
{"text":"Thank you Gilbert for making my ASU grad celebration extra especial. Your recommendations were divine. And that \"Hooked on Butter Cake\" was delectable!!!! The oyster sampler was such a treat. Thank you."}
{"text":"Had New Years Day dinner here today with friends and had a great time!! We started with 2 dozen oysters for our appetizers and they were very fresh, which for Arizona is rare.  Our dinners were very good and we sampled 3 desserts- our favorite was the warm butter cake with cold ice cream which was suggested by our awesome waiter Gilbert.  If you eat here- ask for him- he is sarcastically funny and made our evening with his witty personality.  The manager Ashley was very sweet and checked in our table personally several times.  We give them an A+ and made reservations already for a second visit!! Thanks Gilbert and Ashley!"}
{"text":"Best Lobster Bisque In the world. Got here about 845 pm and were greeted by some very friendly staff - the two bartenders, the great hostess and our awesome waitress Jen. The blackened salmon was spiced and done just perfect and my 2 sides of the sautéed veggies and zucchini were outstanding. Jen was great and checked in on our party frequently and was very attentive and quick. Got me extra lemons and I was just a happy camper. Had no idea there was an extraordinary seafood restaurant right here in Tempe. Love Pappadeux up off the I-17 and Peoria Ave and now have one on this side of town. Nice comfortable and classy atmosphere and feel. Be back soon."}
{"text":"Almost any place that has Stone Pale Ale can get 4 stars with me...  I've started taking visitors here regularly, especially if they want fish.  They print their menus new every day to reflect the fresh fish.  The garlic roasted asparagus appetizer is the best I've ever had.  Sometimes, I just want this for lunch all to myself.  I keep experimenting with the fish, and I've been both pleased and disappointed.  Had dry Thresher Shark once, and I don't really like their blackening seasoning.  And their side items suck.  But if you're looking some good fish or oysters, and hate side items, check it out..."}
{"text":"Best place for oysters in Phoenix!  There are always several varieties from the Pacific Northwest, often some from British Colombia, and the eastern seaboard as well.  Our visit tonight was made more enjoyable by our server, Gilbert.  Attentive and also very pleasant and enjoyable.  Personable!  Like he enjoyed his job and likes people! I will look for him next time we come in."}
{"text":"Bottom line:  Food great--server must have been new or over stressed.  Place was noisy.  We were one of three large groups all seated in the same area, which increased the noise level.   We were a group of 8 -- arriving 10 minutes apart. 2nd  group arrived just as 1st group were getting water which was then given to second group arriving.  One member of first group waited a good 15 minutes to get water and had to ask a couple of times with a dismayed response on part of server that guest would want water.   Drinks took forever .  Server apologized that bar was busy though  we could see no one in the bar.   Food came quickly, was hot and as requested.  4 beet salads were fantastic but they are large.  All servings are large.  Most in the group opted for a only one or two appetizers which were more than adequate as an entree.   A couple of full meals in the group which were beautifully done and excellent quality.  Shared desert of creme brulee was excellent.   We will go back but hope the service has improved a whole lot."}
{"text":"My husband and I love seafood! we had been wanting to check this place out....we finally did and were really dissapointed! totally overpriced! We had a bowl of clam chowder to start off and it had maybe one clam in it and super salty. We decided to go with the cold sea food plate(not sure what its called) the description said for 2 or more ppl. They made it sound like a very large plate with shrimp, crab, oysters and clams ($27).finally got our food and were surprised to see a big plate full of ice! Only 4oysters 4shrimp 4 small clams and 3very small crab legs! This was not even enough as an appetizer for 1 person! Our server was very distracted, even though it wasnt busy at all. deff wont be coming back to waste money on something that is not worth it at all."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time to this restaurant and will be our last. Our waiter Cody spent more time \"chatting\" with his fellow co-workers. Salad was late and only brought when we asked about it. Iceberg lettuce for $4.95! Food was immediately brought after salad. Food was luke warm. Ordered scallops and paid $25.00 for them. 8 1\" fishy tasting. Worst scallops ever, especially for the price. We ordered a bottle of wine and Cody put in a bucket at the end of our table. Not once did he come back and pour for us. Very sub-par for the money. Won't return!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place tonight on a whim. We walked through the first open door we saw, which ended up being the bar. Once we finally walked in the right door we were sat immediately.   My hubby ordered the barbecue shrimp and clam chowder. I had the seafood Cobb. All of our food was great, especially the bbq shrimp. We will definitely order it again.   Service was decent and the ambience was good also. We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I had read a review that King's was an over priced Red Lobster. Unfortunately the food didn't even measure up to that. Over cooked fishy tasting salmon that wasn't fresh, soft shell crab was horrible, and for the price point we were expecting much more."}
{"text":"Great oysters and clam chowder. It's on the pricier side but worth it. Good place to go with friends or a date. But the con is wouldn't recommend to go alone. They don't really play attention to you if you are alone."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time and I must say I am FIVE star impressed. Went in alone and sat at the bar and a delightful gentleman named Chris G helped me. Since I wasn't familiar with the menu, he suggested a bunch of different options. Went with a sushi roll which was delicious. I was hankering for something else light, and Chris recommended the grilled zucchini. BEST decision ever! Soooo good. I sincerely appreciate Chris and his great personality and way he guided me through the experience. And the menu, yes please! I'll definitely be back, especially to see Chris! Thank you thank you!!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with a colleague of mine for lunch.  I had the wild jumbo shrimp pasta dish.  The shrimp were not completely shelled, and so I had to pick the shells off.  The tomato sauce used in this dish was watery thin.  My colleague asked for no cheese of any kind on his fish tacos but he still got cheese.  So he just picked it off.  Our waiter was not the most attentive person.  A manager never stopped by to ask how things were.  There are definitely better places to eat at Tempe Market Place.  I seriously doubt I will ever return here."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to come here and try this restaurant out for the first time. We were greeted immediately and had a table outside in no time. We had a great server who admitted she was training but she was bubbly and answered all of our questions. When her shift ended we had another server named Steven that was always on top of everything. He consistently brought bread and drinks without ya ever having to ask, and brought our food out in minutes and consistently checked on us to make sure we were doing okay. The management of this restaurant should be very proud of their employees and how hard they work. The food was amazing and we left extremely happy. I would recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to try this place since I love sea food. I went with my boyfriend and his mom. All 3 of us felt that our food was just not good. It tasted funky and service was mediocre. After eating my tilapia, I headed home and felt immediately sick. Long story short, I had the worst food poisoning ever! Will not be returning.."}
{"text":"My wife and I loved this place!  The menu was outstanding - thoroughly impressed with the wide variety.  I had the New England Clam Bake - delicious lobster, clams and mussels... the clam chowder was delicious as well.  My wife had the ono, which she thoroughly enjoyed, too.  Highly recommend the oyster sampler as an appetizer.  We took home some bread pudding for a late night dessert too.  Service was great, lots of good recommendations from our waitress.  We went to Wildfish near Fashion Square not long ago, and I'd have to say we'd return to King's way before going back to Wildfish.  Much more reasonable, price-wise, as well.  No complaints - they made a great first impression on us!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience tonight at king's! Ashley was my server and she helped me choose what to eat, I had the hazelnut salmon she recommended and it was delicious! Finger licking good! Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Finding a FRESH Seafood Restaurant in Arizona can almost always be a chore so we were delighted when they presented us with a menu printed daily with a great selection of fish - shellfish etc.  We immediately got the party started with a selection of several oyster types harvested from Canada to Mexico and were amazed when they arrived super fresh and prepared correctly.  Very uncommon to get them so fresh without grit or shell pieces.  Without doubt the best we've have had in Arizona.  Im a Clam Chowder fanatic and I cant believe I'm saying this but this place had the best of anything I've tasted on either coast.  The chowder was filled with fresh clams not chunks of potato filler much appreciated!  Seems like we ordered one of everything and all of it was fantastic never experience a fishy smell or taste the entire meal the way fresh fish should be.  Nice atmosphere and a cool little pub area makes this place my favorite Fish House.  Prices are fair for this type of meal possibly a little steep for the Tempe Mall I would imagine they could triple their ROI with a location in North Scottsdale hint hint.  Anyway this place is well worth the 30 minute trip from our home and we will be back again soon.  Forgot to mention they have great craft packets to keep the kids busy at the table better than any other restaurant - our six and eight year old girls loved it."}
{"text":"Came last Friday night for my birthday.  Had drinks, apps, dinner and dessert.  I got there a little early so was able to find open seating in the bar area (which was a nice sized booth that comfortably fit four) and the waiter/bartender was very nice.  We had wine and beer, then ordered two types of oysters on the half shell.  They were INCREDIBLE!  I had not had them before so I wasn't sure how I would like it, but I LOVED them.  At the recommendation of the server, we got the Kumamota and the Black Duck Salts.  Served w fresh horseradish, cocktail sauce, a white wine sauce, and a new mango habanero (DELISH) and they were OUTstanding.  Also had the edamame (salted) which was good.    For dinner we tried: blackened swordfish, Parmesan crusted ono, grilled ono, and fish and chips which the waitress said were the best she has ever had.  They were good, it was all good!!  I highly recommend the Parmesan crusted ono and the blackened swordfish!!  The Brussels sprouts are good, too!!    We finished off w a shared Jack Daniels Bread Pudding.  I would go back weekly just for the oysters and the bread pudding!!  (Okay, and the Wine of course)   Try it out if you're in the Tempe Marketplace area"}
{"text":"It is too bad that this location is so far way from home. I have been to several King's Fish House both in AZ and in CA. And have always been very happy.   I am not a fan of the Tempe Market Place area. It is a little difficult to get in and out of.  But I do like the setting.  We were able to sit outdoors and watch people go by which was enjoyable.   We had Salmon for both orders. Very well prepared. Just a nice piece of fish well cooked.   Service was very good.  This is always a go to if we are in the area for a nice piece of fish."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I really don't like seafood... so I'm not very qualified to review this place. However, my friend invited some of us to stop by here Friday to celebrate her just-received and hard-earned master's degree from ASU. So I went. We ate in the oyster bar area. The place is really cute. Sure, it looks kind of corporate, but in a nice way. It's definitely the kind of place I would want to stop by for drinks with my friends. The wine list was OK, and they had some nice sake and martinis. Our waitress was great and really friendly.  The seafood platter they ordered smelled good.. and everyone who ate it said it was tasty. It's definitely a bit pricey, but if the seafood is really that fresh, I guess it's worth it.  I'll probably bring my parents here when they visit and then I'll try something off the menu. The choices (aside from the sushi and seafood platters) range from pricey things like $20+  for the trout or the macadamia-nut crusted halibut to $12 tuna melts.  In the meantime, I have a good opinion of this place. Oh, and it's actually in the parking lot area of Tempe Marketplace, not in that annoying pedestrian part dubbed \"The District.\" So that earns it some points, too."}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give them a single star is because I'm hoping one day they get back to form. My family has been going to the Salt Cellar for many many years and this place stole our business. They always made amazing seafood, fish, and believe it or not had the best wings hands down! Now its just not the same. I heard they switched or lost their main chef, I don't know if thats true. But I bragged this place up for years and finally got my entire girlfriends family to try it as they're big seafood fans. Absolutely terrible the last couple viists. Nobody finished their plate. The staff is still excellent and extremely knowledable about the menu. The cook needs to go! I feel bad because I know it hurts their tips. To say the least after paying for the whole meal and about $200+ later I was upset and won't be back. Salt Cellar is a farther drive but if I'm dropping that much money in a restaurant I want my money's worth."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my girlfriends on a weekday. Our food took 45 minutes to come out which seems a little long, especially when you're there for your short work lunch break. I think our waitress was new as she just seemed confused and took forever to get us our checks. Nonetheless, the food was decent but not amazing - maybe mediocre? It's not any kind of stand out of a restaurant in which I'd look forward to it or return to it. Just...blah."}
{"text":"I ate their sushi on 3/22 and found that it was fresh. Service was pleasant and not hurried."}
{"text":"We try to come here on every vist to AZ. I like this location way better than the one in Long Beach. And I live in Long Beach and used to work at that location. LOL. The service was prompt and friendly. The server asked if we would like the kid's food with the appetizers which is always nice. He answered all of our questions and gave suggestions. The food was hot and tasty. Everyone enjoyed their meals. We had a good time."}
{"text":"I had the live Maine lobster, she had the Mahi Mahi.  Lobster not bad (though not the best), and the Mahi Mahi was a little overcooked and dry.  Nothing terrible, and - unfortunately - just what you'd expect at an upscale \"Mall-oriented / Chain\" operation.  Overall, the place is OK but I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"My dad was in town and he is an east coaster so he is very obsessed and picky about his seafood. Our server, Cassie, was amazing and answered my dads million and one questions. Our food was delicious and my dad didn't have one complaint (which is rare)"}
{"text":"It's rare that I take the time to write a review but my experience here was so bad I felt compelled to alert anyone who is considering dining here.   My husband and I had a night out and were looking forward to good food and conversation-we had spotted this seafood restaurant and thought we would give it a try. We went in and immediately it was clear that we just seated ourselves. Then a friendly waiter came by and took our drink order. However, it was at least 15 minutes until the drinks returned.   Looking over the menu, we quickly realized that it was more expensive than anticipated (most dishes running between $15.00-30.00) But we rationalized that it's worth paying the difference for quality seafood. So, we placed our orders.  When the food came out and we glimpsed the plates-immediately we were concerned. The presentation was awful and the portions small. My meal consisted of overcooked Talipia, with a small, sad pile of potatoes and coleslaw. I don't consider myself much of a cook but I can tell you that I've made far better fish and potatoes at home. My husband took one bite of his shrimp and pushed the plate away. His shrrimp, also overcooked, was completely unappealing and repulsive.   We discussed the situation and both decided the last thing we wanted to do was spend roughly $70.00 on a horrible meal. We agreed that we'd had far better at Red Lobster. The price rivaled one of my favorite seafood restaurants The Chart House (where I can guarantee you, you won't be disappointed).   We flagged the waiter and asked him to remove the meals from our ticket and that we'd go elsewhere for dinner. Something my husband and I had never, ever done before.   The one good thing I can say, is that both the waiter (and the Manager who came by) were very apologetic and accomodating. They were the one bright spot in a truly awful experience."}
{"text":"Out of my desperation for needing a seafood fix in Tempe one night, the boyfriend and I went to King's. It was a brand I was familiar with so I thought it would be good...the result? Very over-priced, over-cooked, bland seafood. Fish and chips were not nearly as good as George and Dragon, the shrimp was rubbery, and the clam chowder tasted like it was from a can. The only good thing about the meal was the complimentary sourdough bread and the servers were very nice and friendly. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I go to Tempe about once every five years. It's just not convenient for me and, other than ASU, there's nothing there that I can't find closer to home.  On the way home from an awesome car show at Falcon Field in Mesa my wife wanted to pop into Tempe Marketplace. It was lunchtime so we stopped in at King's.  The service was terrific. The ambiance is great and the New Orleans jazz is easy on the ear. But, I came here to eat and I wasn't disappointed.  I had rainbow trout with a side of rice and corn on the cob (which they cut off the cob). My wife had Mexican shrimp on a skewer with a mixed veggie side and rosemary potatoes. Both dishes were excellent.   I may have to come to Tempe more often."}
{"text":"I seriously considered giving King's Fish House 1 star, but our waitress was helpful and tried to accommodate us as best they could.  However, my oysters on the half shell were small and served with some weird shaved horseradish, my steamed shrimp was rather boring, and my wife disliked her fish so much that she couldn't finish it and asked for it to be sent back.  She said it was over-cooked and flavorless.  To be fair to the staff, the waitress and chef both came out to our table and offered to re-cook the fish or make something else entirely for her, but by then, my wife was too turned off to have anything else.  I would never try King's Fish House again.  For a guy originally from Maryland who's had some pretty amazing seafood, there was just too much wrong here to be given a second chance.  For what it's worth, my brother-in-law had the New England clam chowder that night with us and said it was the best he had ever had."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been going to it since it first open. I had my first oyster there and love them.  Great service and great food! Huge menu that includes a sushi. They serve sough dough bread while you wait for your order. The have huge booths. They have great take home kid cups and a very nice kids menu that even comes with tattoos. The house wine is also pretty good. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"My mom came to my side of town for us to have lunch and proclaimed she wanted lobster bisque. We both searched via our tech routes, her on her GPS, me on my phone via Yelp and I found this place first.   The reviews seemed to be mixed but Mom was paying so if she wanted lobster bisque, I was going to appease her.   The place looked dead from the outside and hardly any cars in the lot behind the restaurant didn't bode well. But they were open and just in the lull between lunch and dinner.   Mom got her lobster bisque and I decided to give it a whirl too. It was quite tasty and I didn't find it bland at all, unlike what one of the Yelpers said. I found it to have a nice little kick and loved the large chunks of lobster that are usually lacking at other places I've tried it.   Sourdough bread was served with our bisque and it was a very good sourdough.   Our server, Ismael, was very helpful with the large menu. About the only fault I could find with the service is that he seemed to be in a rush to leave the table while my mom was still talking to him. Granted, she was rambling a little about things not related to the menu but it was still a bit rude. The place wasn't busy so I don't think he had to rush off to help another table. I'm going to chalk this up to possible inexperience since Ismael's name tag was handwritten so maybe he was new?   We both decided to try a po' boy sandwich. The menu lists a shrimp po' boy but says to ask your server about other po' boys. We did ask and decided to try the oysters. The oysters in the sandwich were so tender and delicious. The sandwich came with fries and coleslaw. The fries were hot, thin and yummy. Coleslaw isn't my favorite but I didn't think to ask for something else. The sandwich had coleslaw inside too and that was okay but on its own I wasn't a fan.   Dessert was creme brulee, as usual. It was great with a large, sweet strawberry on top.   Going to take my fiance to try the oyster bar. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"This place is \"aight\".  It's not a fancy seafood place, but its not Long John Silver's either.  I actually found it to be a bit pricey for the type of fare, even though understandably seafood tends to be more expensive.  I felt like they were charging more just because they could, but not because they deserved it.  I've had dinner here and a few happy hour events.  Everytime I leave like I enjoyed the food, but was slightly ripped off.  If I were to recommend something:  The calamari and fish tacos were good."}
{"text":"Well.....strike two for you! After my last bad experience at this restaurant, I was immediately contacted by management. They were very apologetic and assured me that what had happened was not their policy. They followed up with sending me a $50.00 gift card, which was not necessary, but an appreciated good gesture. I gave them another try on January 24, 2018 at about 3pm to be sure to get Happy Hour prices. Well, if you can believe it? It was again a disaster! The first bill brought to me, over charged me by $20.00! I was billed for a premium wine that I did not order @ $12.00 per glass (my wine was $5.50 per glass). I asked the bartender if the wine was not on Happy Hour? He said no, but then admitted he had incorrectly charged me for a different wine. Yes, he was apologetic and corrected that error. Next, I gave him the gift  card that I had been given to pay for my bill. You guessed it!, It was no good!!! I was told by the manager that he could comp my charges ($34.38) but could not give me the remaining balance?! He suggested that I pay for this meal, and he would activate me a new card?! Well in the end he was unable to activate a new card but returned my invalid card w a note stating it was worth $50.00??? I am extremely grateful that I did not have a guest with me as it would have been even more embarrassing.  While I must say they were polite and apologetic, I can't help but wonder what's going on?? Do they pad these bar bills hoping most will just overlook it? Do they not have a petty cash fund to cover such mishaps? To ask a previously dissatisfied customer to pay them again for poor practices? Watch your wallet at this place!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was nice with one glaring exception......stinky, spoiled mussels!  The manager took them, returned and agreed they were bad. Her solution was free dessert and compted the mussels.  Bring big mistake for a fish house."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and always experienced great service and food. However, we walked out about a week ago due to awful service. We asked for a booth and were seated in the bar area. Maybe we had bar staff waiting on us and that explained the service, but there shouldn't be any difference from the main room. We ordered two salads, I had soup and appetizer, and we got a kids meal. The service was fine at first, with the kids meal coming out first, then my soup....then my appetizer....then nothing. Had to ask for more bread. About 45 min after waiting, we asked the front staff to tell the manager to get us some service. A few min later, our waiter came back, no apology, no eye contact, very sullen. He took a couple dishes away and said the food would be coming soon. Fifteen minutes later, still nothing, the waiter couldn't even be bothered to come by again. An hour after we had arrived and my husband still hadn't gotten anything to eat except the bread. We decided to leave and talked to the manager who apologized, comped what we had ordered and gave us a gift card. We'll obviously come back since this is clearly not normal for a restaurant like this, but was very surprised at such poor service on this night."}
{"text":"Came in with my friend around 3 and had no one greeting us to get a table. I had to beg someone to get my disabled friend a seat.  Waitress was slow getting to our table and forgot to get my friend a second glass of wine. She finally had to go to the bar to ask for another glass and there was probably only five people in the whole place.  The salad that was $8 was a handful of salad which wasn't worth the money."}
{"text":"Went here the other night with my bf, it was both our first time there, we wanted to try some oysters and had no idea which ones to get so our waitress Denise recommended getting the sampler.  The sampler was very good and I would definitely recommend anyone who wants to try oysters to order the sampler. Denise made our first time there a great one!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try someplace new for our girls bi-weekly happy hour so we opted for this place because they had sushi.  The place was dead empty which should have been a red flag.  The waitress seated us and gave us both the happy hour menu and the regular menu.  When we were ready to order some apps & cocktails, the waitress rudely told us that she can't honor the happy hour prices in her area and we would need to move....so why did she even give us the happy hour menu?!   We moved over to the bar where we were greeted by a cold preoccupied snobbish bar tender. We were so uncomfortable ordering because we obviously were not welcome.  When I was ready to order I had to get up and walk over to the bar because our server never returned.   We ordered a few drinks and apps just to try this place out.  Food was mediocre and drinks ok but this def isn't a happy hour place and due to the horrible service we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have no idea where to even begin to express my appreciation for this place and their staff....   It was remarkable and extremely nice to enjoy my birthday dinner at such a great delicious restaurant with management out of this world.   Michelle (Manager) was such a beautiful soul. We didn't know if she was a manager or a waitress serving us when we first sat down, until she made that clear 15 minutes in. She made us feel like we were literally guest at her own home. She was welcoming, informative, patient, fast and just soooo awesome!   Although it was sad to see her leave us, she handed us over to a great spunky waitress named Cassandra who was also very sweet and helpful!   The food was amazing!  The Buttercake was fantastic!!!   And If you make a reservation ahead of time they sit your party down quick and fast.   There are no amount of words to express my sincerest appreciation for making the end of my day a great one! We will definitely be back. Thank you so much Michelle! You are such an amazing woman and host!"}
{"text":"Highly over priced for Red Lodster style food. I paid $22.00 for 3 shrimp and 2 scallops.  Serously better food Joes crab Shack."}
{"text":"Best seafood in the East Valley by far!!!! The fish is really fresh and incredibly delicious. The service is excellent. And the ambience/decor is lovely. The problem is that this restaurant is not cheap. This is not a $$ restaurant. More like a $$$$ restaurant.  But the food is so good, it's worth the splurge every now and then."}
{"text":"Denise is awesome and was very attentive to our party. She was very friendly and knows the menu well to make suggestions. Being from California and going to King's Fish House out here it was nice to know that the Tempe AZ staff, Denise in particular, was just as friendly!! Thank you Denise! Next time I'm in AZ I hope she's there working because I'd definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago and I have to say it was pretty good. The angel hair with shrimp was good. The only complaint is that there wasn't enough of it. They used really shrimp, not the frozen stuff you get at most restaurants. The clam chowder was also very good. The ciopinno was good also. The amount and variety of seafood was good and the sauce it was cooked in was really good. I have had some good, and not so good ciopinno. I have to say this was pretty good.   My waiter was really nice and the atmosphere was great. The only reason I am giving them a four star is because the portion for the angel hair and shrimp was small for the price. They could have also give a couple more pieces of garlic bread with the ciopinno."}
{"text":"Another great experience at King's Fish House!! Consistently great service, the highest quality seafood and the prices are reasonable!! You get what you pay for!!!   We had the pleasure of meeting Michelle, the manager, and she was genuinely concerned about our opinion of how things were going.  If you are thinking about going to KFH, stop thinking and just do it. Hands down the best in the valley!!   Thanks guys for helping us have a nice Sunday lunch!!   We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I have driven by King's so many times and wondered how the food was.   I finally went in for dinner Saturday after a movie and was pleasantly surprised.   I had grilled catfish, rosemary potatoes and spinach.   It was great.  My friend had the trout and he loved it.  It is a little pricey though.    BTW, the movie..... Shatter Island... HATED it.    I know hate is a strong word But I really HATED it."}
{"text":"Good food & great service! Our waiter, Aiden, was awesome! We were seated right away on a Friday evening, no wait. This place has an extensive & impressive bar with everything from sake to JD.  My bf loves his sushi & fried fish... being able to get both was cool, but it was just good, not great.  I opted for the sirloin & it was delicious! The fried shrimp was also pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Ok, so we've been here  a total of two times... the first was a pretty good experience... not memorable, but ok. Then we went again, last night for Mothers Day. My Dad wanted the Trout so bad, so us Mothers gave in. The only positive thing to say about them is how nice they were, we called to see if we could get in at for dinner at 8:30pm, (they closed at 9pm) they said not a problem. I was kinda impressed cuz we've called other restaraunts and they have turned us down in the same senario.... when we sat down, we ordered right away, it took awhile for us to get our food, i finally had to flag our waitress down and ask her to bring whatever was ready whenever it was ready. My salad was probably the best thing I had that night next to the water. Come on tho, how hard is it to mess up salad and a water! My Dad had the trout, he finished it but said it wasnt the best, my Mom had the Chicken Parmesean. She picked around the stuff she didn't like. I ordered a coconut shrimp apetizer, it arrived cold. The bill for two adult entrees and one appetizer a small ceaser salad and one childs meal was $80....  we still tipped $20, but $100 for one of the worst meals in a long time wasn't worth it. We won't be back at least for awhile."}
{"text":"We dined here for lunch the other day and it was delicious. I had the crunchy lobster roll with a side salad and it was a perfect lunch. Jessica was our server and she was on top of everything. Our drinks were always full and she was very sweet. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Sourdough bread is awesome. Entrée delivered before the salad was halfway finished. Waiter calls me \"bud\"... I am almost 50 \"dude\" \"Dude\" removes our unfinished plates without asking, the place was empty, I have a feeling why now. I wanted those fries dang it.    Old \"Betty\" sitting next to us warns us to avoid the sea bass but give a thumbs on the zucchini   Bud won't be back"}
{"text":"At at Kings Fish House last night with my wife and two toddlers. We had an awesome experience mostly because of our waitress Jessica V!  She new we had kids and time was limited. She took our order right away and was so great with our kids. Jessica was such a pleasure at a time where good service is hard to find. We loved our food as well. I would highly recommend Kings Fish House for a great atmosphere and how great it was for our kids!!!  Well done Kings!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Never disappointed with any off the Kings Fish House franchise. Been to several in SoCal. Kudos to Kings!"}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant. We are seafood fans. We ate there for the first time based on the Yelp recommendation as we were visiting from Georgia. The Hot Seafood Appetizer was splendid.  The food portions were appropriate (probably the right proportion size, but you always want more!)  The restaurant did not receive 5 stars as the fish that we ordered was bland.  The wahoo was very fresh, but the blackening was only on top and not throughout.  My daughter ordered fried catfish and had the same issue as she ordered mustard to provide more flavor.  The standout was the grilled zucchini which was excellent.  Our waitress was excellent and the food arrived promptly.  The food just needed more flavoring throughout."}
{"text":"Seafood Cobb is so delightful! Cassandra is always nice and super helpful! I love coming here for lunch."}
{"text":"Yes this is the place. Creative with all the dishes. Excellent presentation. Very clean. Restrooms clean. Staff very professional"}
{"text":"I went here with my best friend recently. Her fish was dried out and full of bones and the waitress acted incredibly rude and pious to us. I ordered a quesadilla, and it came in a little basket cut up and stacked, was incredibly thin and tiny, and tasted funky and gave me a bad aftertaste that lasted all night. We're never coming back to Tempe Markeplace, let alone King's Fish House."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were there on Sunday the 22, we were the only people sitting at the bar, got a dozen oyesters, a poboy some tacos.  The food was good, the oyesters were fresh and the bartender was awesome.  We did some Peppar vodka and oyester shots, had some nice cold brews and enjoyed the day.  I wanted to thank the bartender also for getting my girlfriend addicted to 3 Olives Dude vodka.  You were right about the sprite mixer hahaha"}
{"text":"Service is excruciatingly slow and the waiter had absolutely no knowledge of the menu. He had to go to the kitchen over 8 times to answer each question we had about the menu. It took 20 minutes to place our drink order and an hour to get our entrees. The portions are tiny, tiny!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, after 4 days of horrid food poisoning I need to drop them to 1 star... or actually no stars.  I'm confident it was the improperly prepared Cobia that left me hunkered down in the bathroom for nearly a week.  I suggest they stick to fish that is easy to prepare and turns quickly... salmon, tuna, etc..."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend. Saw the review on King's Fish House on YELP! Certainly helped and affirmed the majority of the reviews...fantastic, yummy, and satisfying. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone on the Tempe area looking for some excellent seafood."}
{"text":"We were invited back as guests of the restaurant and had a good experience.  Based on our first visit we stayed with fish dishes only.  The halibut, tilapia and oysters were all excellent.  The tilapia was very good.  The halibut was excellent again.  The entrees came with two sides - we chose spinach, baked potato and rice.  The dozen oysters were $28 and were  6 different types.  After asking  about oyster happy hour specials we were told the shooter oysters (3) were $4 in the bar.  The service was also very good.  We still did not feel the entrees were a good value for the money but had a good meal."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to give credits to the management team of King's Fish House. Managers are open to take customers' opinions into consideration, and I found it very proficient and adequate.   As stated in my previous review, I will draft another updated review based on my last visit for lunch at this place, and also for the invitation of the management team. This time, after jumbling through the menu once again for a closer look. I decided to go for Rainbow Trout Amandine with mango salsa, plus 2 sides of sauteed spinach and grilled zucchini.  At this moment, I am impressed. The trout is crunchy from the outside, but it also contains enough moisture. The garlic sauce (you can find it on the table) and the main entree is a perfect combination together. However, the sauteed spinach is just not my taste. The sourdough bread is fresh baked, and I prefer to enjoy it with sugar and butter on top.   Once you know what to order, you can't go wrong with the your selection. They rotate the lunch menu every week, so each day they will have different specialties. Overall, my experience was improved this time. Thanks King's for the hospitality."}
{"text":"I went in on a whim, out shopping, saw sign, & \"fish\" sounded good. A Monday, late afternoon, I was recommended that the bar had Monday specials. Ordered house Chardonnay, expected \"ok\", it was delicious! Unexpectedly sour dough bread appeared & I took a taste & it was exquisite! I told the bartender I felt I was in San Francisco, & she said it is flown in DAILY for them! The fish tacos were a great choice, they were delicious & even though I was really hungry, I couldn't finish them!  I can't understand the negative postings here, surely having everything much better than I even expected can't be just an accident!  I am a picky eater and only expected to \"grab a bite to eat\" & was very pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday after church, we decided to dine out for seafood. My friend remembered the building and sign while visiting Tempe Marketplace, so we decided to visit. Accidently walking in the bar side entrance we were pleasantly greeted and suggested to sit wherever we would like. Choosing a spacious private seating area offside the bar and restaurant allowed us to enjoy ourselves with tons of room to spread out and without the worry of disturbing others with loud laughter. A refreshing Desert Pear Margarita for happy hour made it hard to have just one! We ordered a great Coho Salmon dish which was fresh, juicy, and seasoned wonderfully and an awesome Lobster Crunch Roll as well. Friendly service from Paul the manager and Anthony the bartender; loved the special touch of meeting the chef tableside too!"}
{"text":"Wandered in on a Friday night after walking through the mall trying to decide what to eat. Well we landed in a winner. Our waitress Timber was probably one of the best and most knowledgeable waitresses I've had in a long time. She knew the menu and offered good suggestions. The food was wonderful my guest and I had the mussels and then had the surf and turf. Everything was cooked well and was flavorful. Timber was attentive and checked in on us at the appropriate times and just overall wow'd us on service. Great place, great food, great service."}
{"text":"We decided to try this out after seeing other Yelp reviews. When we entered, the place was basically empty. (Probably a warning sign) After being seated, our waiter was prompt and super friendly. He answered lots of questions and gave recommendations since we are from out of town. So we thought this was going to be a fabulous experience! However, after apx 10 minutes of his help, he left to help another table. When he came back, he basically lost his friendly attitude. We had to ask for drink refills (Always a huge no-no in our book!!!) He seemed preoccupied the rest of the night (but the place was basically empty). The food was pretty good. Kids ordered sushi, I had the trout almandine, and my husband had the blackened rainbow trout. No complaints there. But the prices were steep for the meals."}
{"text":"Excellent seafood at reasonable prices. Menu is extensive and printed daily to assure availability. Oysters are a must starter. Good sushi also. At lest a dozen fresh fish to choose from daily. Don't missed the mashed potato side."}
{"text":"So you think that because this is a chain the quality of the seafood and its preparation could never be good as what you grew up with (for those of you who of course grew up on the ocean - in my case Long Island and New England).  Well, the answer is... it is a chain and it could NEVER be as equally as good.  Here comes the BIG however...  (big)HOWEVER(big), for what this place is I gotta tell ya, you can get a \"thank you that was oh so close\" meal here.    Firstly, the warm bread that they give you unlimited amounts of may be the best in Phoenix.  (Dude, did you just say bread?). Yes, I did!  Bread never tasted so perfect, so yummy.  Fresh out of the oven and perfect every time.    As for the meals, some are better than others and their menu here is VERY seasonal - changes out daily almost.  That said, soft shell crab was in season when we went and a bunch of us got it \"Picatta\" style - lemon, butter and capers.  And... Wait for it.  Wait for it... It really was almost a 10 out of 10.  Just so so good.    Thank you Kings Fish House for bringing Long Island to me and my family. Thank you for making such a beautifully prepared dish.  Thank you for making me smile inside (in my mouth and stomach) and out.    P.S. So I have heard, the meats and pastas are good not great.  So do as the Romans do... When at Kings Fish House, get FISH man!  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"It started with the waiter- horrible, then went downhill from there.  The sea bass was brown inside, the filet was tough and had a horrible taste,  the crab cakes were served with tartar sauce and were bland.  The waiter rarely came around and when he did, it was like he was forced to and doing us a favor.  Do yourself a favor,  DO NOT come here, there are much better seafood restaurants to go to that also treat you better."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is so much better than Red Lobster.   Menus are printed twice per day so the information is up-to-date and you never have anything run out.  The seafood is as fresh as it can be, seeing that we are nowhere near the ocean, and the variety of options is tremendous.  It isn't just your classic steamed with lemon or fried with tartar sauce.    Every experience here has been top notch. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the mood for seafood."}
{"text":"Love the Kings fish house.  If you go pls do yourself a favor ask for kaylin. She is a fabulous server.  So the plus you have kaylin AND fabulous food"}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch a few days ago.  Their lunch menu is HUGE and is probably about the same as their dinner selections except for the prices.  I wasn't in the mood for a $50 lunch so I opted for the Caesar with wild bay shrimp.  The size and price was reasonable but it was just \"eh\".  My buddy got the Louie salad with crab and shrimp and it looked \"eh\" as well.  The service was excellent.  The diet cokes almost came faster than I could drink them.  Their fish and oyster selection look great so I will definitely be back because there really aren't that many places in Tempe with decent seafood."}
{"text":"I really like this place although I've only been here twice.  Here are two things that happened today during lunch that make me give a five-star rating:  1.  My dining companion and I want to share our lunches.  We tell our server and without us asking, he offers to split them in the kitchen for us.  Nice - most restaurants charge for this.  2.  With our fish came not a tiny little slice of lemon that cannot possibly be squeezed without getting it all over one's fingers but instead, a half a lemon!  Wonderful.    I will add the food is quite good - crab cakes, fish and chips.  I really like everything about this restaurant and will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My husband, parents and I went to Kings Fish House at the beginning of March for my husbands birthday.  He is from Oregon, and a little bit of a seafood snob.  He really wanted seafood for his birthday meal.  We checked out places on Yelp but couldn't find any place that had great reviews and was in our price range.  We decided to take a chance on King's Fish House, and to be honest we were a little skeptical of a chain restaurant.   Not to mention my husband and his family goes clamming off of the Oregon coast several times a year, so he has high expectations for fresh clams. We were absolutely blown away by everything about this restaurant.   Our server for the night was Chris G, and he gave us some amazing recommendations.  He really listened to what flavors each of like individually and made individualized his recommendations for each of us.  Even pairing it with some wine and side dish recommendations.  Not to mention his recommendations for clams were spot on!!  Each of us had a different dish, and each of us swore we had the best dish at the restaurant.    In April we celebrated my fathers birthday, and he requested we go back to King's Fish House.  As soon as we walked in, we saw Chris. We requested him to be our server again.  Not only did he remember us, but he remembered what we had ordered a month earlier.  AMAZING!!  He gave us some new recommendations, and again his service was incredible!!  My personal recommendation... go to the Kings Fish House and sit in Chris' section.  Get some of the Skookum clams if they are in, and definitely try the Macadamia Nut Crusted Halibut.  Delicious!!  We will be back again very soon!!"}
{"text":"This place was good! I had the king's albacore roll and the king's spicy seafood chowder. The sushi roll was delicious! The chowder was ok. It's my own lack of knowledge about soup but I was disappointed the chowder wasn't creamy. Now I know chowder means creamy OR chunky.  Plenty of room in the restaurant so you don't feel like you're sitting with the party next to you. Family friendly environment. The service was slow but I will still go back when I'm in the area and craving some seafood."}
{"text":"Never again... for starters the waitress kept us waiting for 10+ mins to even ask us what to drink... brought us our drinks and never returned. It wasn't until me and my friend decided to leave,  that someone tried to tend to us.   The menu options were not that good either. Hopefully no one else has to experience this."}
{"text":"OMG what a wonderful time and dinner we had at King's!  My sister called to make a reservation for a double birthday celebration - Mom's 99th and my 64th. Sis called the ph# on the website and actually spoke to Heath Bumgardner, VP of sales in CA. He was very helpful and took it upon himself to make the dinner reservation for us. Not only did we get the reservation set up, but when we arrived there were 2 bouquets of flowers and 2 birthday cards signed by all the staff wishing us a happy day! What a surprise and delight! Patrick, Teresa and John met us at the front door and came to our table to wish us happy birthday and to make sure we had everything we needed. We had appetizers of grilled oysters and mussels - which were delicious to say the very least - always a good dish if you are looking for more of the same thing! We moved on to lobster and sea bass - which were all prepared expertly and melted in our mouths. Of course being our birthday we had to have dessert - we shared the cheesecake and key lime pie. I have now officially fell in love with both!.  We will DEFINITELY be back next year for Mom's 100th!!!"}
{"text":"I am on the fence as to whether I go with a 2star on this review or a 3. THIS is when I wish there were half stars! It's not quite a 3 and yet not as low as a 2. Oh well, I digress. You get my point, I am sure. If not, you likely may after you read my review. I had this place bookmarked in my handy dandy Yelp bookmarks for months as places I needed to try. Being from the coast of Nor Californ I A , I crave , YEARN for seafood. Last weekend my hubby and I opted for King's Fish House over another seafood place that is also on our bookmarks and more towards his office because it looked fun and lively and the menu looked good. We were also in the neighborhood. I was on the fence with what to order once I saw the Filet and South African Lobster. Again, being picky, as I notably am, I asked the waitress about the lobster and the size of the filet. She could not give me sizes on either, rather, 'It's good size and the lobster is, BIG'. Okay. That's relative. I just did a hike with my husband and I were hungry! I also asked about the Shrimp and Crab Louie, again, one of those things I LOVE from home. Same answer, \"It's BIG!\" Clearly our waitress was excited about the menu and thats a good thing! She can't make my mind up, so I went with the Filet and Lobster. My husband ordered the Oysters Rockefeller. They seem to be prepared differently everywhere that we travel or dine, which is a lot and all over. Did I love these? No. It wasn't the oyster. It was the sauce. It was lemony and just had a strange consistency and looked odd to me. I could not get past that. I let my husband have at it. The next course that I had was the Clam Chowder. Loved it! It was lukewarm but was still so good. Again, being from just north of SF, the bar is set pretty high for clam chowder and this was very good. We asked for bread, a) because I feel clam chowder HAS to have good bread with it!, and b) we saw it on other guests table..Envy! Oh! Did I mention and can one tell from this review that my husband and I were HANGRY !! this particular night?! We finally flagged our waitress down for the bread and she explained that she didn't understand what was up with the kitchen and , 'they seemed to be out of it and it appeared that they were baking more'. I also asked about that  glass of Pinot Noir that I had ordered. She looked a little confused but got it. Now our dinner arrives. When I have any steak anywhere, I always check the done-ness of it first, because at times, its over done. This would be one of those times. This was more like medium to done in the center and no pink on the edges. The filet was also not juicy. Was it 'good sized' , as she claimed when I initially asked? No. This is where I always have an issue as a customer: DO I say anything? I mean, she seems busy! Am I being high maintenance? I've already asked for the bread; requested the late Pinot! NOW the filet is off! THEN as a Yelper, I leave a review and someone then messages me, or has and says , \"Hey! Did you let the waitress know?\" In this case, my husband says, \" That is a $45. meal. We are telling her.\" The lobster was good. Not great. It was good. Maybe the food had sat for a few before she could get it to us? It happens on busy nights! I waitressed back in the day in college! I know how it goes! So she comes and we explain. She states that she will see if she can re-do it and a few minutes later she comes back to say they are re-doing a steak for me. Several minutes later, as my husband is pretty much done with his meal and I have finished most of my lobster and now down to the part of what is a baked potato that isn't fully done... (not raw, but not cooked enough to eat), out comes another filet with a different person who asks me to cut into it while she watches. I cut into the middle and it doesn't look medium rare either , but it did look juicer and hot. I do not want to deal with this all evening and I am pretty much over it at this point. She walks away and the same thing. This time the edges of the steak were even more done than the first! I would not think this is that difficult! I've cooked filets at home; its simple to get a medium rare steak! As I said, I was over trying to get it correct at that point. I did like what was cooked of the baked potato! I probably didn't need the entire thing anyway, as it was pretty big! The Sautéed Spinach side was cooked perfectly and I took that home after being full and added it to my eggs the next day. The Pinot was good, as well and the waitress, she totally tried! She was cheerful to the end with us! We thought she was great! Now the bus girl cleaning the table behind us who spilled water and then said, \"OH SH*&! \" in a whispering voice; Well. We heard that and that's probably not okay! The decor was nice and the patio seemed fun. We also liked being able to call ahead and get a reservation with no issues. See, it's not all bad. Would I come back? Probably not. Back to my bookmarks!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fish fan, but the group I was with was, so as long as there's some non-fish on the menu, I'm fine with it.  It's a nice place, and the service was friendly and attentive. The cocktail napkins with incredibly corny fish jokes (where do fish borrow money? a loan shark) was kind of a fun addition.  I ordered a pasta dish which included chicken, peppers, and a creamy tomato-based sauce. It was good, but I don't know if it was $14 good. Prices went up from there for the various fish dishes, but I can't really judge those without trying them.  I've got no complaints, and I'd probably go back if I'm with people that want to go, but I think I can find similar quality food for me at about 4 or 5 dollars less for lunch."}
{"text":"4 Fabulous stars! My mom and her boyfriend were in town and I have heard good things about this place so we decided to check it out. My spring mix salad was good, but standard. Let's face it, we did NOT go for the salad anyway. I ordered the Parmesan crusted Sand Dabs with my two choices as garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. My Sand Dabs were fabulous! I had only had them one other time at McCormick & Schmicks and I think these were just a tad bit better. They were perfectly fried. I must admit the sides were a tad bit lacking. My husband ordered the Mexican coconut shrimp and they were quite good as well. Mom's boyfriend ordered Halibut Almondine and was in love at first bite. My mom had a salmon dish and she was also quite pleased with her choice. Now. I can over look the standard salad and the slightly ordinary sides but this place gets -1 solid star for the dessert. I ordered creme brule... one of my favorites. It tasted like it was from a box. A standard custard... Blech! I held out on dessert every other night we went out to dinner and this place was quite a disappointment. Now on the other hand my husband and mom both devoured their bread pudding with out complaint and the mom's boyfriend claimed his key lime pie was only second to one and that's saying A LOT.   Now. This place COULD have been 3 stars but they got the bump up for the following reasons:  -Fresh fish flown in with menus printed daily  -I caught a buzz off two martinis.  -We were all happy with our selections which is quite a feat.   Should have been 3 stars because:  -price is on the higher side... I'd rather go to McCormick & Schmicks for the price  -crappy desserts.   I admit I am a little surprised to see some of the reviews at 1 or 2 stars. We had great service and our food came out in a timely manner, as did our drinks."}
{"text":"So after spending $150 on dinner for 4 people, without alcohol, I have to say the food was horrible.  I would have complained more at the time but we were celebrating my parents 50th anniversary and I didn't want to ruin their evening.  My $25 salmon dish was overcooked and for some god forsaken reason they put a ton of spice on it.  My husband's fish was also dried out and tasteless.  The only things that were good were the cheese grits and spinach."}
{"text":"$21.00 for 3 shrimps and 2 scalops. Very disappointed in the serving size. See photos!"}
{"text":"Fish tacos were good.  Sever was pleasant and took good care of us.  We enjoyed the outdoor seating.   Go here and not Dave and Busters."}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone to this place twice. The first time the service was mediocre, but the food was excellent. Today, we went back because we wanted to try their sushi. Overall it was a good visit, the service was OK, the sushi was good, but they didn't do a very good wrapping for the sashimi. I don't think we'll go back I'm just not sure it was worth the bucks."}
{"text":"It was my pleasure to again visit Kings Fish House in Tempe Marketplace. The food and service is always great. The Seafood Chowder is great. Spicy and piping hot.  It was our good fortune to take a seat in one of the gigantic booths in the bar tonight, Fat Tuesday. Among the talents that stand out, was Gilbert who is a great talent.  The outstanding feature of this restaurant is that they operate on the \"Team concept\". If Gilbert gets tied up, another talent jumps in to help, including the supervisor.  Good food, wonderful people make for a great night out.  Did I mention the rich wood tone decor. You can't do better."}
{"text":"Came in with my best friend and her family and had an amazing experience! We were sat on the patio and it was beautiful and the temperature was perfect. There was a decent variety of menu items from sushi, to fish, to pasta, to sandwiches. Our waiter and even the staff passing by our table were personable and attentive! A bottle of wine, lobster, and good friends... ideal night!"}
{"text":"They have fish, a good selection of it and decent quality.  I have been to other locations of this chain, was was not expecting too much for my lunch.  We starked with the ahi poke which was decent, could have used a little wasbi to enhance the flavors.  I shared a bit of the grilled artichoke appetizer, which for being healthy was great.   For my main I had the Seared Ahi Tuna $16.95 with 2 sides. The tuna was surprisingly great, thick, no sinuousness at all great color and flavor. The sides selection is also quite impressive and one can even have a small salad as one of the sides.  You can't avoid some of the chain quirks, like why am i given tartar sauce with seared ahi, and not soy and wasabi / ginger  Service was decent given our large group, and the ambiance is a notch above family casual, I would call it business casual.   Overall it is not a cheap meal, but good fish rarely is."}
{"text":"I'm going to come out and say I rarely give a chain restaurant five stars. You know why? Because I am slightly pretentious and believe high quality food and creativity is lost the more commercial you get. Ok, so now that I am have gotten off my high horse here is the deal.   Apps. We ordered the cocktail shrimp half pound. They had been flown in that day and we're fresh as fresh can be and they were fantastic. They are presented on a bucket of ice which is just freaking awesome. We asked for extra horseradish and guess what came.... Actual freaking root. The good stuff. The shake your moneymaker real deal holyfield root.   I ordered the Nawlins Shrimp. My server described it as sweet and spicey. Rarely do I pick up both sides but seriously. This time was a hit. The Nawlins BBQ shrimp was fantastic. Sweet and spicey and full of flavor. Very similar to a gumbo.   For desert we had the buttercake. Seriously, it, was, awesome. Sweet and salty. This is an awesome place that although has a chain feel, brings the heat, and the sweet."}
{"text":"Great food, and great service with a lovely smile from Cassandra! :) We were seated quickly and all of our (many) questions were answered quickly and knowledgeably. I enjoyed the nice dining experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in tonight after some shopping at the Tempe Market Place.  We haven't been there in a while and we all felt like seafood, and Kings is our go to sea food place.  I will start off by saying that our server John was very attentive and never had to be reminded of anything.  Very much a plus when you want to have a nice evening.  I ordered something not on the menu and he asked the kitchen if they were able to prepare my scallops the way i like them which is pan seared.  The only thing I suggested after I got them is that they should have been seasoned with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Otherwise they were perfectly cooked, not crowded in the pan which as any cook worth their salt would know that steams scallops and they become rubbery.  These had a great sear on them.  My husband had linguini and clams and he really enjoyed that the clams came out in their shells because he said they were fresh and not canned white clam sauce.  Of course I would be remiss if I did not mention that this is about the only place in Phoenix that you can get sourdough bread that tastes like the piers in San Fransisco.  To finish off our night the manager Miriam came over to ask us how everything was and we were happy to tell her how great the service was and she told us that John had only been there a short time.  I told her they need to keep him because he made the night worth our while as well as the food.  Good job folks keep it up!  We'll be back when it is wild salmon season."}
{"text":"I went on a local seafood restaurant kick over the holidays, including serving King Crab for Christmas Dinner. Check out all my current reviews.   Everyone knows it's thin picking when it comes to \"fresh seafood\" in Phoenix, but Kings Fish House at Tempe Marketplace is the standout IMO. Kings is actually a wholesale fish distributer out of Santa Ana, CA. This allows their Fish House's to have one of the largest seafood selections in Southern Cal.   Been coming to the Tempe location since it opened, a solid 4 star seafood \"eating\" experience. Their selections are extensive, I suggest you check out the online menu to prepare yourself before you visit. While the decor is modern and clean, to be honest, its just a tad boring for me. The oyster bar should be just jumping ... but they have a totally clueless happy hour, the place just lacks excitement!  The quality of the seafood and large selection of fresh oysters at Kings Fish House puts Pappadeaux to shame, but the low energy keeps Kings from being more popular IMO. Rarely is the bar or restaurant over half full, I guess that good or bad depending on your viewpoint or philosophy.  A much more creative happy hour experience and late night \"live local Jazz\" would really put this place on the map ... yet still fit their theme.   The potential of Kings Fish House is off the chart ... if only they could light a fire under the local management."}
{"text":"I think seafood restaurants are one the toughest eateries to do well. I had the sushi plate, and my husband had the Ono grilled. Both were okay, but nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Visiting PHX so we wanted to try something we did not have back home. Walked in and was greeted by a friendly hostess who quickly sat us at our table. She did great and earned one of the two stars above. Asked if it was our first visit which it was and continued to welcome us as we walked to our table. Then the waitress came and took our drink orders and also asked if it was out first visit. She then explained the menu in detail and answered our questions. I ordered the fish and chips and my wife ordered the fried shrimp. Up until this point our visit was fine and the helpfulness of the waitress earned the second star. The water tasted funny but we chalked it up to being in a different city. Once the food came I grabbed a fry which they were delicious. The waitress came by and asked how are \"first bites\" were. Well I had not taken one yet but my wife answered \"so far so good\". Then I thought to myself that's different, but thought it was cool that she came to check on us right away. Well that first bite of fish was disgusting. The fish was extremely oily and slimy. The batter was raw on the underside or so soggy from the oil that it tasted raw. I really wanted to like it cause I was starving so I tried the other piece, NOPE same nastiness. So I let my plate sit there till the waitress came by again. A few minutes later she came by and instead of asking if everything was ok she asked if I was finished and took my plate. Now, who sees a full plate of food with one small bite missing from the main part of the dish and assumes I'm done and that everything was ok!?!?!  I'm not a child, I'm a full grown 225 pound man. How many grown men that you know eat two bites of a $20 plate and then are full? Not once did she ask again how our meal was. Just brought the check and that was it. So since I wasn't asked I paid for my meal, left a note about the fish and told them to look for my review on Yelp. Then I walked out hungry and ate some McDonald's on the way home. If I can eat McDonald's you know my expectations are not that high but the fish at Kings was so subpar I would have rather paid $20 for a filet - O - fish sandwich. Lol. Needless to say we will not be returning, must've been why the restaurant was so empty at prime dinner time on a Friday night. Should've been a red flag when we walked in. Waitress if your reading this it's nothing against you. I know you didn't cook that crap. But learn from it. You got potential but pay attention."}
{"text":"Started with oysters and Chardonnay - then grilled Tilapia, rice, and zucchini - a perfect meal!    All recommended by our beautiful bartender who looked exactly like Thandie Newton!  Then - walk the mall at tempe mkt place. Very nice!!!!"}
{"text":"Hungry ? Want something to eat , like maybe fish?  Well this place has fish.  This is the kind of place to go when you want food but not really caring how good it COULD be .  Service was great and very prompt. The host  , bartender, and wait staff seemed very into their jobs.  But the fish itself was not memorable.    A bit pricey , but offered many kinds of fish which seemed to be flown in?   I wouldn't go back unless a group of people were meeting there and it was what everybody else wanted. Enough said."}
{"text":"I dined at KIng's Fish House last night after happy hour.  King's has ample indoor and outdoor seating and was crowded. I ordered the char broiled Swordfish with mashed potatoes, brocoli and a diet coke. Carol was my server and did a great job of refreshing my water and diet coke. The Swordfish was cooked to perfection and delicious as well as my sides. My bill was $28 before tip; kind of pricey but what can you do during lent?  Excuse me while I rant a little,  I was seated in one of those benches with the two chairs on the other side (seating for 4) instead of seating me in a booth for two.This seems to be the logic employed at many restaurants when there is a single diner; it's like being put at the kid's table during Thanksgiving. It didn't help that there was this 2 year old next to me that would emit these shrill strident yelps every few minutes. The mother finally got a clue when she was starred down by a grandmotherly type at an adjoining table and went outside when her kid was acting up again."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner for my Mom's  birthday! She so loved her 99th dinner, we had to go back! She received the special treatment that she deserved! Thank you Michelle, Lindsay and Kaylin..and our server..sorry didn't get her name! And the entire staff..it was a very special event for us!!!"}
{"text":"Love the meals that truly #inspire me! #parmesancrustedAlaskanSandDads, mashed potatoes and fresh corn.... my palate is doing a happy dance. Thanks Michelle and @kingsfishhouse! #datewithhayes"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's b-day. The food was ok, service was mediocre, had to ask the waiter for water about 4 times, before actually getting it. They serve a variety of seafood, which really isnt that memorable, when I say memorable, I mean you can find better seafood at another place.   Prices are ridiculously expensive, I understand its seafood, but come on! I wont be returning unless I get a gift card from someone, even then I'll consider re-gifting it!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here with a friend and her parents. Everything on the menu looked fantastic but I decided to be good and order trout with glazed carrots instead of pasta or fried fish with fries. My friend's mom ordered crab cakes before her meal and offered me a bite. I was impressed it was all crab and lightly breaded on the outside just the way I like em! I enjoyed my trout and tried my friend's halibut and her mom's Alaskan Sanddab. Both were equally delicious. We finished our meal with key lime pie and creme brulee. I am extremely picky about what seafood restaurants I will eat at and I give King's Fish House two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"for being located in a land-locked state, the seafood was really good. i had this spicy bbq shrimp dish and the shrimp was done perfectly. it definitely had a lot of spice, so if you like spicy food, this one's for you.  the clam chowder was not too thick and not watered down. could have a little more seafood in it, but still worth eating. the service was really good, our waitress was super nice i didn't have to ask/wait for a refill on my drink. will go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Overpriced is the first word that comes to mind.  And the word that dominates my feelings toward this place.  They never mentioned that the \"KING\" in the name actually  means you have to be as RICH as a REAL KING to afford to eat here.  $13.95 for a ( relatively forgettable ) simple oyster Po' Boy with 5 oysters on it and a side of fries?   Yep.  Who's dumber - me for paying it, or them for charging it?  I think Me.  When I saw the price, I should have just closed the menu and left.  I also had a $6.95 \"Cajun Bloody Mary\" which had nothing Cajun about it, as far as I could tell.  It was mostly ice, served in a 16-oz glass.  So maybe about 6 ounces of \"drink material\" inside.  It lasted about as long as it took me to take 5 drinks out of it.  Let's do the math:  At $6.95, with 6 ounces of substance, that comes to $148.26 per gallon.    So at least I can say I had a Bloody Mary which came in at around $148 a gallon.  I will never, EVER go back to that place.  And if you do go, bring the credit card with the highest available balance, because you are gonna need it.  P.S.  A manager attempted to contact me after seeing this review, trying to make things right for me.  I understand their prices reflect the \"going rate\" for fresh seafood in the desert.  I've upped the star from 1 to 2 to reflect the respect for management for trying to contact me and make things right.  Kudos for that.  P.S.P.S.  I had Pete's Fish and Chips the other day, and I realized that their fried oysters are the EXACT SAME ONES which are served at King's Fish House.  So if you want to know what these fried oysters taste like, eat at Pete's.  You can get about 15 oysters there for the King's price."}
{"text":"Let's say you're driving down the road with an extra twenty bucks you don't know what to do with.  You're hungry, it's lunchtime, and you come here.   King's Fish House  Where you can get an entire glob of tuna fish smeared between two slices of whole wheat bread. An artful creation resembling something your eight year-old niece would throw together, this along with a fistful of french fries and some bitter-as-gall deli slaw, and all for surrendering that dirty twenty! Actually it's 10.95 but with the diet coke and the tip, you're now up around twenty.   Other delights our party sampled were from the \"Fried\" section.  The menu description only reading Farm Raised Mexican Shrimp. It didn't say how these little Mexican Shrimp numbered only four.  Or how they must've been raised in one of the Kennedy's swimming holes in the Hampton's where they were fed fois gras and cavear, sipped champagne from gold-rimmed flutes, and had their own nanny, wistfully lulling them to sleep each night with old Raffi tunes.  Because at 13.95 for four of these little bastards, they must've led one pampered life on that farm!  Three of us. Two tuna fish sandwiches. And one small school of Mexican Shrimp, a water, a diet coke and an iced tea....48.95, with ten bucks for the tip, almost sixty bucks.  Unless you're dining on the company expense account, or someone else is picking up the tab, theres no reason on earth to pay twenty bucks for a tuna fish sandwich and a diet coke.  Or for that matter,  watch your friend eat  four of the Kennedy's prized pets."}
{"text":"I loved this place despite the reviews. Our food was excellent, service was amazing, and everything was clean. Those are the three things I always look for and this place passed with flying colors. Would highly recommend if you're ever in the mood for some good seafood."}
{"text":"Given previous mixed reviews, I was expecting a decent meal, but nothing like what it ended up with. Probably the most enjoyable meal I've had in years - every course was outstanding for both me and my wife. Excellent service as well. The highlight was the YellowfinTuna (following their recommendation for medium rare, which was just right), with perfectly cooked asparagus and a creamy, cheesy Mac'n'cheese. No doubt at all that we'll return next year when we're back for Spring Training!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and my food was cold. If they had been busy, I MIGHT understand, seeing as I used to be a server myself. But we were the only people in the place. And considering that I've had such great experiences at other King's locations, I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"The King crab was awful tonight. of course I said nothing because my server was so awesome but they were over cooked and shrunken"}
{"text":"I come here for the oysters and a cadillac margarita.  And it is awesome, every time. They have possibly the best oysters in Phoenix (shhh!).  The kids gets fish and chips when we visit, and from what i've sampled, that is good too.  As for the rest of the menu?  Who knows.   The options are plentiful, but nothing inspires me to stray from my usual.  For whatever reason this place is not very popular, which means you can get a nice booth to yourself.  Steep prices, location, or fade-into-the-background vibe could be a factor for keeping others away...  but personally, I like that it isn't too crowded.  Sometimes you want  a spot to get away from noise and this fits the bill."}
{"text":"Ate here on Father's Day plus 1, a hot Monday evening!  My son invited me out to celebrate his Dad, a loving gesture.  At 5:15 PM the place was very quiet, but then to be expected on a Monday night after a holiday.  The restaurant had a somewhat rustic appeal to the inner fisherman.  It had a clean look and no fishy odors detected.  The booth was large and comfortable.  Our server was pleasant and efficient.  My son ordered \"Jumbo Shrimp Ballerine\", (Tomatoes, garlic, basil and white wine) with tail-on shrimp, looked like about 8, with pasta in a mild red sauce with chunks of stewed tomatoes .... (18.95).  Not a lot of flavor but the medium shrimp were fresh tasting.  For starters I had a cup of King's Spicy Seafood Chowder .... (5.25) (but a dollar off with an entree).  Fabulous chowder, loaded with fish and potatoes, very spicy but super delicious.  This alone would  get me to return!  Next came Wild Costa Rican Mahi Mahi.... (21.95) which I ordered blackened, accompanied by Grilled Zucchini and Sauteed Fresh Spinach.  The veggies were vibrantly colored and super fresh tasting.  I had to send back the spinach because it was cold which our waiter did rapidly and graciously.  The fish was perfectly cooked, reminded me of New Orleans.  No room for desert unfortunately.  This is a very nice place for tasty fresh and properly cooked seafood, in a pleasant atmosphere.  I shall return."}
{"text":"A restaurant with \"fish\" as part of it's name should know how to cook fish perfectly.  I ate there twice because I wanted to give them a second chance...mistake.  The fish was overcooked and dry (both times) and the lobster was rubbery.  It was such a let down.  The lobster bisque that Costco sells is far better than the bland version at Kings.  They did have a decent California roll though.  I was disappointed and will avoid this place in the future."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place, amazing food!!  Great service!! I had the most amazing steak and lobster for my birthday dinner!! My first visit and definitely not my last!!"}
{"text":"Nice establishment. Booths are nice and long so you aren't crammed into the persons arm, next to you. The menu provided a pretty decent selection. They have a lot of oyster and clam options, but I didn't try any as I don't like oysters or clams. The rest of the menu offered some great fish dishes and some steaks, salads and burgers. I opted for the king crab legs, they were hot and tasty. The sides were pretty good, although the garlic potatoes were just a bit on the dry side. Hubby got a Filet mignon. It was grilled perfect, and very good. He wasn't a fan of the cooked spinach side, but everything else was good. He enjoyed the coffee stout, and said it was nice because it didn't have an \"after-bite\" like some of the stouts can.  Our waiter was a 8/10. Although at first he got our drinks and then didn't return to our table for almost 10 minutes, once he came and got out order, he was much more attentive, and came to refill our drinks often. We sat and visited for quite a while, so we were sure to drop some extra tip on the table since we took up one of his booths. Overall, I was pleased with the visit. We will return again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  After a failed attempt to dine elsewhere, we ended up at King's.  Unlike Maria Maria, King's was more than happy to promptly seat us without an unnecessary wait.  There is quite an extensive menu, and a lot of complaints on Yelp about price.  I didn't think it was all that expensive.  Most of the entrees were under $20 and that includes two sides.  I had the crab cakes with french fries and mac 'n cheese.  The crab cakes were good even if not the best I've had.  Mac 'n cheese fell a little short for me.  Not much cheese.  More like mac 'n bread crumbs.  My husband had the king crab legs.  Expensive ($43) but 1 1/2 lbs and tons of crab meat.  I tried and it was delicious.  We had excellent service.  Could not have asked for better!  My one suggestion would be to serve the sourdough bread warm!  At least until June!"}
{"text":"Came to celebrate an anniversary. Love the concept of this place, but the service was very sub par. Our waiter was quite cold with us. When asking if he recommended the calamari, he said \"well, it's fried.\" Brilliant. My salmon was completely flavorless, and the apple cobbler had no dough. It was just crumbs, apples, and ice cream. I was hoping for much more... Very disappointed. One star for the atmosphere and the other for the fresh-baked bread."}
{"text":"King's Fish House has become one of my favourite places for seafood.  Seattle is one of my homes away from home, so I am picky when it comes to my seafood preferences.  I want things to be fresh from the ocean and deliciously prepared.  The first time I went to King's, was after an afternoon of running errands.  I had seen it and been uncertain of what to think.  I was seated quickly and given sour dough bread quickly.  The lemondrop martini was perfect.  Many bars get this simple drink wrong, but not King's--it had the sugar rim and perfect balance of lemon juice, vodka, and other ingredents that I wanted. The raw oysters were delicious and presented appetizingly.  My trout almondine was flaky and fresh, served with a wonderful side of rosemary new potatoes.  I felt completely spoilt and decadent when I left.   My other visits have been equally stellar.  One time, the server offered to get me an item not on the regular menu: salmon served on a cedar plank.  The salmon was covered with a delicious assortment of spices and carmelized brown sugar.  It makes me want to get my own cedar plank for cooking.  I can't wait to go back!  The selection and freshness of the raw oysters alone are reasons to check it out, along with the retro decor.  KUDOS!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought me here to satisfy a seafood craving. It has a good atmosphere, and a decor that reminds me of a dignified New England bah (bar).  The server Aiden was awesome. The kitchen made a small goof in timing and he offered us options to maximize the pace of our dinner experience. That was a subtle thing made a huge difference. I'll eat here again just to sit at his table.  The food wasn't miraculous, but I'm certain I'll have a hard time finding better shrimp or scallops."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for some oysters! The oysters & shooters were phenomenal & Jeremy's service was even better. :)"}
{"text":"An upgrade to five stars is necessary after weekly fish lunches for the past several months.  I have managed to cycle thru the various seasonal \"wild\" salmon plus a portion of the other fish.  For me it is hard not to order salmon but will be forced to make a change in the fall at the end of the season.  Today was the Wild Kuskokwim River Coho Salmon summer salad with asparagus, tomatoes, blue cheese and fennel in an orange-soy vinaigrette.  An excellent recommendation by the waitress versus my standard cedar plank roasted salmon that masks the rich mild salmon flavor.  This time simply grilled and very, very tasty.  What I am really beginning to like about King's Fish House is excellent service in the center section under my favorite fish.  The mighty AK Chinook King Salmon...I remember catching a similar King 20 years ago on the Kenai River in AK.  My dad and I each caught Kenai King Salmon on separate days.  Each fish was 42 inches long but mine had 27 inch girth and my dad's fish had a 26 inch girth.  The scale was broken so never knew what they actually weighed (40 to 45 #).  My dad claimed his fish was larger so there you go.  The photo of us holding the fish at sunset with a background river shot is proof of their size but not of their quality.  As I recall they were the best tasting fish ever but 20 years is a long time to try to remember taste.  As far as service goes either waitress knows that I start with a Kiltlifter  but not the size - sometimes 16 oz and sometimes 22 oz.  Both waitresses know I like salmon but if the same type of salmon is on the menu I have switched to sea bass or rock fish.  Hard to believe but sometimes change is good but I almost always remember to go back to salmon the next time."}
{"text":"I was delighted when I was contacted by Sarah (manager) through Yelp to elaborate a little more about my negative experience at King's Fish House 2-3 weeks ago. I sent her a message back through Yelp giving her my personal email so Danny the GM could contact me but I have never heard anything back since. Maybe they dont check Yelp that often.. I am not sure what the reasoning is..  :o("}
{"text":"I am not the biggest fan of seafood, but I happened to visit here and Nicole (bartender) took very good care of us. She was definitely pleasant and had a lot of suggestions for our likings. She is an excellent server!"}
{"text":"Went there on a client lunch and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I had the Parmesan Crusted Sand Dabs which also came with two sides so I had the sautéed spinach and house salad. Everything was so fresh and so good.   We had a group of 7 and service was great. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have dined at this chain's Long Beach, CA location as well as the Tempe, AZ location.  Based on those previous experiences we chose the Tempe location as the place we wanted to dine on our 45th wedding anniversary.  Based on this most recent experience I don't think we will be back.  First, we were both disappointed with the portion size.  My wife ordered the grilled catfish and she was served 4-5 ounces of fish.  Normally, one would think in terms of an 8 oz portion, especially catfish, which is one of the more common of fish.  She thought it tasted OK, but just OK, nothing special.  I ordered the ono, one of my favorite pacific fish, and I also got about a  5 ounce portion.  It was good, but nothing special.  The catfish was $17.50 and the ono was $20.75.  Very skimpy portions for the price.  There is a $1.50 extra charge of you want asparagus.  That's a little high given that most grocery stores sell it for about that much per pound in season.  My wife got about 6 stalks.  For sides I chose mac and cheese and the corn.  I got mashed potatoes and corn.  The mac and cheese was promptly brought out when I noted the problem.  It was good, but you only got about 4 ounces.  The corn was so loaded with silk that it was barely edible.  My wife said her mashed potatoes were good.  The wine list was standard, nothing outstanding.  Prices for wine were average$7.50 - $11.00 per glass for most choices.  Service was OK, but just OK.  The waiter did not seemed impressed with our response to his questions that we were celebrating our 45th anniversary.   \"Cool.  I've been married ten years,\" he responded (at leasat he didn't say \"Awesome.\").  Good for him.  He never asked if we wanted a second glass of wine, which cut his tip, of course.  He did come back once to ask if everything was OK.  My wife questioned the size of her portion, but he just said that that was what the kitchen prepared.  Tip and tax put us over $80 for just a so-so meal.  I could not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Totally average quality and taste... over-priced chain. Service is always lacking. I don't go here by my own choice."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre and the service was just as mediocre as the food. Nothing to brag about but not horrible. Definitely not worth the price because of the lack of service. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Really just lackluster. The service was friendly, but the food left much to be desired. Very pricey for what it is. Everything seemed very dry. Edible, but not memorable in the least. I can't imagine why anyone would eat here twice. We won't be back."}
{"text":"FOOD: my mom and I decided to splurge a little and MAY have gotten a little more food than we needed! Ha! CLAM CHOWDER: super yummy! It was creamy (as it should be) and had plenty clams! My favorite thing about the soup was how they chopped the potatoes into small pieces. I know...it's a weird thing to care about, but I do not like big chunks of potatoes so it was perfect! 1/2 DOZEN OYSTER SAMPLER: pretty good, but my mom said she's had better. They were on the smaller side. SHRIMP TAQUITOS: hmmm I think we envisioned these to be made a different way than they were. They weren't horrible, but noting amazing. The shrimp was good, but the wrapper they used was meh.  ROASTED BEETS SALAD: yum!!! So refreshing and delicious! The combination of the beets, nuts, cheese and berries was amazing! Must try (if you like beets)!!!  SERVICE: quick and our server was friendly! No complaints!  PARKING: it's located in the temple marketplace so plenty of free parking.  ATMOSPHERE: Has both indoor and outdoor seating and a lot of space. Very clean and nice decor."}
{"text":"Jason was a great server and did awesome. Had the mahi mahi. For the price, there should have been twice the fish IMHO. Nice place."}
{"text":"This place has the tastiest clam chowder I've had anywhere. My boyfriend would agree. We were served by Gilbert and he was absolutely wonderful. When he noticed we hadn't been brought any complimentary bread before the beginning of our meal, he gave us a freshly baked loaf. It was so delicious we didn't mind that we got to enjoy it after our meal! He even offered to bag some up for us to take home since they were closing and planning on throwing the rest out. It was so nice of him - he must have noticed how much I was enjoying it!"}
{"text":"When I'm going to a seafood restaurant I have slightly higher expectations for, well, everything than normal. I know the prices will be higher than most other fair and believe the experience should be better. Feel free to tell me how I'm mistaken.   I had the grilled salmon with zucchini with sauteed spinach. It was fine. Nothing special about it. Nothing about the dish made me think, I have to come back here."}
{"text":"I did not like my meal at all. The swordfish was the thinnest fillets I've ever seen. Made me wonder if it was swordfish. Roasted rosemary potatoes were actually deep-fried and had no Rosemary. The crabcakes tasted more like a plain Fishcake."}
{"text":"Went in with low expectations cause of the reviews but a few made me believe there was hope. I sat down and was promptly greeted by my waiter, Brian. He was friendly and offered a few good suggestions on what to eat. I ended up ordering the clam chowder which was really good. All in all it surpassed my expectations."}
{"text":"It's more like 3 1/2 stars. Not a fan but wasn't turned-off either. I guess if the service was quicker the experience would have been more enjoyable ~ That is where I am not a fan. It took FOREVER to get our appetizer...then an eon to get our entrees. It wasn't busy, as there were only 4 occupied tables present (small parties of 2-4). It took 25 minutes for us to receive our Cold Seafood Platter appetizer. Possibly another 10-15 minutes for our entrees after we finished our appetizer. Not sure where the service failure originated, if it was the kitchen or our server. But they were slower than a herd of turtles. I did enjoy my meal. It was definitely enough so fill me up. The quality was good. The taste satisfying. Presentation appealing. I ordered the King Crab Legs that come along with 2 side. I chose the Grilled Zucchini and Caesar Salad. The zucchini was grilled to perfection. The caesar salad was a liitle dry. It could have had a little more dressing added to it. This wasn't my first time here. It won't be the last time either. There are few places in the Phoenix Valley to get select fresh seafood at lunch time. This place beats the socks off of Seafood Market off of Baseline in the Dana Park Plaza. The prices are a little higher but much worth it as the quality of the fish and seafood is exceptional for being in the desert."}
{"text":"The hostess was pleasant.  The waiter was courteous and efficient.  For the most part the experience was fine, but we went as a group and most of us echoed what many previous reviews say: it's just plain overpriced.  The food is Denny's quality and Morton's prices.      I got the Cobb Salad which should be easy, but right away my problem was that it was $17 and mostly a plate of iceberg lettuce with a few other ingredients thrown on to break up the bland, pale green presentation.    I expect a bowl of iceberg lettuce to masquerade as a \"salad\" at McDonald's or maybe as a dinner salad included with a meal at Denny's.  Otherwise iceberg lettuce should never be used outside of a nursing home.    My companions had several other dishes, but all had the same feedback, nothing really wrong, but the prices seemed way out of line for the quality of food that they got.   If you are going to spend $20 to $30 a person for a meal (before alcohol or dessert), you have much, much better options."}
{"text":"Love seafood, Kings is delicious with lots to choose from.  Went here for dinner just before a show we were going to attend.  My regular fish fry was delicious, batter crunchy and crispy.  Like they say \"I can't believe I ate the WHOLE thing!\".  I have been here a few times and my only caveat is it still is no match for a Buffalo NY fish fry with haddock.  Can't get that here.  But whenever I want/need seafood this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Really!  Overpriced! My fish (halibut)dry and overcooked. Hubby's swordfish he said \"very good\"  Terrible rosemary potatoes dry and floury...nasty carrots. Grilled zucchini ok. Less than impressed with a meal that was $100 plus. Service ok, but we were not asked if everything was good. Won't be back! SAD"}
{"text":"The food was good and service was excellent. I was only confused when we came in. Didn't know whether to wait or seat ourselves."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here today (3/13/15) and had a very nice lunch.  I had the Albacore Tuna Salad and it was really very good.  She had the fish and chips and it looked very good also.  The server was very accommodating and although I have been there several times, I will always go back.  Food has always been good.  Not necessarily inexpensive but that is usually the case at good seafood restaurants here in AZ.  It always seems fresh!!"}
{"text":"I have been to King's a few times in the past. Every time I go here I am never disappointed. My colleagues were very impressed with their first time here so, after that experience, I had to write a review.    I took my colleagues to lunch at King's and I went against my normal order of Ahi and went for another type of Tuna. Albacore. I had the \"World Class\" Tuna Melt and the Oysters Rock. Everyone knows that I make the best tuna melt on this planet but I would have to say that King's makes the second best, bar none :) The bread was perfectly toasted and very hot when it arrived. The Tuna was the perfect temperature and it was served with a smile. The Oysters were fresh and the tasty. The rest of my party had some sushi rolls, Salmon cakes, Swordfish, and the jumbo white shrimp. They all devoured their meals, like I did.   Service was fantastic. We had a party of six and we started at the bar. We ordered the food and had a drink but then we decided to move to a table to be more comfortable. I noticed it was busy and I felt a little bad for asking the bartender to move us but it didn't even phase her. I could tell she was busy but she didn't once flinch like it was a big deal. In fact she kept going above and beyond. Her sharp attentiveness to our table aside, she served all of our food without \"auctioning\" the food at the table, which I can't stand. Remember I told you we moved to a table after ordering from the bar and the fact that she was busy to begin with. Trust me when I tell you that this is no easy feat. Most people wouldn't even notice this type of service; It's called \"seamless service\". Drinks were always full and the table was maintained very neatly. I was impressed.  I've always been a fan of King's but this experience changed me to an advocate."}
{"text":"I had the char broiled sea scallops and they were cooked perfectly. My husband had linguini with clams and he loved his also. If we didn't live 6 hours away this would be our new favorite."}
{"text":"Outstanding seafood and desserts are to die for. I had the seafood platter and my wife had the blackened mahi mahi. For dessert we shared the chocolate cake and it was outstanding."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service, Cassandra took great care of us.  Will definitely be back for the macadamia nut crusted fish.  Desert was very good too."}
{"text":"Payed 20+ bucks for a piece of wahoo the size of a fun size snickers bar, overcooked to the point that it tasted like a burnt pork chop. Drink sat empty for multiple 15-20 minute intervals. Total bill came out to $125,  yet everybody left still hungry. Hell of a way to waste a birthday dinner. Should've been tipped off by the fact that there was nobody waiting to be seated on a Friday night."}
{"text":"My first few trips to kings were average at best between the service and food. Most recently I went and had the best service I've ever had from Kelsi. She was energetic and professional. Kings kept me coming back for the food but after my encounter with Kelsi I will be making my way back more often! Thanks Kelsi!"}
{"text":"I normally do not leave one star reviews, however I was in this location yesterday for lunch and ordered the rainbow trout almondine. I chose it because it was the chefs special. It was terribly overcooked and the sauce was far too sweet. This should be a firm and flaky type of fish. I usually catch, clean and cook my own. This piece of fish was mushy and had no flavor. I took 3 bites and did not eat the rest THANK GOD. This was the only meal I had eaten yesterday. At about noon today I had the worst stomach cramps and issues that I don't want to get into detail over - food poisoning. I called to speak to the manager and she was conveniently \"on the phone with a customer\" the lady who answered the phone did not offer to take my number for her to call me back.  Do not eat the fish here guys- it's not worth trying to work and run to the bathroom every 20 minutes.   Needless to say I will not be returning and I will be letting everyone I know about how sick this food made me."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  What an experience!  I'm not even joking when I say this is the best seafood restaurant in the Phoenix metro area! Jessica's service was professional, friendly, and extremely detailed."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not so sure on how fresh the oysters were. Service was good, food not bad for a mall restaurant"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a late lunch, I had the King's combo platter and she had the macadamia crusted halibut.  The fish on my platter was soggy and soaking with grease and the scallops were a little chewy. The physical place and the wait staff were excellent, but the food not so much.  They ended up comping my platter, which I very much appreciated.  We both had stomach cramps afterward and the prices are very high.  Our server was Jessica who was excellent."}
{"text":"Can a restaurant get worse and worse every year and still remain open?  I guess so....kings is terrible and huge and gorgeous......I only went there to meet a client halfway.  In the failed Tempe marketplace, where even the Levi store cannot make it sits Kings....an overpriced horrible restaurant that was empty for lunch last Saturday. I would have had better food at jack in the box.  My tacos, which I did complain about, were disgusting....they even messed up the cilantro...which takes effort. You are supposed to use the leaves only...not the stems, the stems are inedible.  I was pulling them out from each bite. Very gracefulI , I was told they were purposely placed there to make a rustic taco....so I guess I can serve a pile of crap and call it rustic? No salsa and stale chips were the perfect accompaniment.... My husband ordered a shrimp salad. The lettuce was old and brown. No one could be bothered to toss it, it had the look of a thrown in handful of each stale ingredient with a tiny amount of shrimp. You could almost see the plastic gloves and the bored underpaid kitchen staff...( wanna bet? ) stay away unless you like bread for dinner. By some miracle the bread is still edible. Please do not believe any good reviews you see here...it is simply impossible that this restaurant transforms into anything but what I saw...a lowly corporate effort........very overpriced.....I would be shocked if they make it year."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time the other night and was very impressed! I had the blackened swordfish with grilled zucchini and northwest vegetables. The swordfish was seasoned with cajun spices and came with a side of dipping sauce (have no idea what it was but it was delish!)  The zucchini was grilled perfectly and the northwest vegetables were glazed carrots, snap peas and string onions. Our waitress was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our dinner.  Will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Went there for a company outing and we found out that the appetizers are better than the main dish...  The Mediterranean dish was good enough...  The waiter was very friendly and helpful when deciding what to order since it was the first time there..."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and enjoyed it very much.  The menu is very diverse and loaded with good fish and other seafood.  The atmosphere was nice and the service was quick...although a little over attentive.  I will definitely try dinner her."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with our dinner here last evening. Starting with freezer burned bread that was terrible. Our food was tasteless and the worst part was the small flies buzzing around our heads and food. When I mentioned it to our waitress (who was very nice) she acted like it was normal for them to be there. No apologies or can I move you - nothing. There was literally a swarm you could see! Mahi Mahi & Swordfish was over cooked and dry, trout was tasteless. When several flies flew into our wine glasses and we didn't want  to drink them, I complain to the waitress again, who said oh I'm sorry let me get you another one. She literally brought back less wine in the glass than what we lost - guess they didn't want to spoil us.;( Prices reflect expectations of better food and definitely no bugs. Next Call is to health Dept as that can't be acceptable!   Update: I received a call from the General Manager of this Restaurant who actually read my review and called me to apologize. She said they used my feedback in their training seminar to ensure this would never happen again. I must say, I was impressed with her sincerity and willingness to improve their service.  Thus I've adjusted my review because it's not how you fall - but how you get up!  Thank you for caring. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious meal for a party of six. The food was well cooked and feesh. The drinks were great and service impeccable.  Our server was attentive and friendly  throughout.  Food was served in a timely manner.  The cost was such a bargain, we will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a seaweed salad.  The portion was approximately 2.5oz.  It was good, but it was too small.  I also ordered the cold seafood platter.  It was good, but when I spend $45 on lunch, I don't expect to have to devein my shrimp.  The Bloody Mary was great, so that bumped the score to two stars."}
{"text":"Great lunch, decent prices, great service, really fresh seafood, perfect ambiance! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Food and server Barclay was the best! Recommend the Louie Salad w crab and shrimp. We have been here about 20 times and everything is always pitch perfect!"}
{"text":"This is the first time my husband and I ate inside the restaurant.  The last two times my husband ordered takeout.  We usually order the fish and chips.  My only complaint is the fish is soggy by the time he gets home.  We live about 12 miles away.  So we decided to see if it would still be soggy if we ate there.  Unfortunately it was still soggy but still very good.  We will probably go back and order another 2.5 lbs lobster.  That was yummy!"}
{"text":"This King's trip was a birthday dinner for me.  We had never been, reviews were ok and the menu enticing.  So last night we made a reservation for 630. Upon arrival, it is confusing because the entrance is on the north, when parking is behind. So then we went in the wrong door, into the Oyster Bar, not seeing a clear entrance. The hostess was fantastic, and we were seated right away. Our server Steven came to take the drink order promptly, but did not return promptly. I sat there for a good 20 minutes with a super hard chunk of cold bread with warm butter...and no drink. Our drinks were dropped, but we were not asked if we were ready to order or if we had any questions in the menu. And we wait. My pina colada was not well blended and quickly looked like the crushed ice at the bottom of your big gulp after the beverage is gone. Should have just gotten a beer or something else. Our orders are taken. And we wait. The cold platter arrives, which has an ample sampling of shrimp, crab and oysters with the accoutrements. The oysters were fresh and sweet. Horseradish freshly ground. I can't compare the oysters, since I've never had an oyster before. The shrimp were large and also fresh. I was not exactly elated at having to dig the intestinal tract out of most of my shrimp. I wasn't expecting to devein before I eat at a restaurant. The crab was not served with a cracker, so we tried our best on the thinner shelled legs. When we finally see Steven later, we ask for a cracker. And we wait. We finally finish in time for the entrees to arrive with perfect timing. I have the crab cakes with asparagus. Both are tasty and are cooked well. My husband ordered the N'Awlins BBQ shrimp. The sauce was hot but not very flavorful. At least those shrimp had been deveined! There was a random piece of lemon mixed in, and my husband, thinking it a pepper or something, got a big sour surprise! The entrees went well overall. And we wait. The hostess clears our table and my husband has been waiting for another beer for.ever. Steven returns and says \"Are you all set and done or did you want dessert?\". Maybe I'm crazy, but I found it a bit brash. It's not like I'm getting a free meal and someone told you I'm a crappy tipper (I'm an excellent topper, btw...I was a server once). Dessert (yes I want it! It's my birthday!) was Strawberry Shortcake, but only since they were out of Creme Brulee. Who runs out on Thursday?? Boo. The shortcake was cold, dry and hard. Not impressed.  It is not likely that we will return to King's Fish House."}
{"text":"Korey was an awesome bartender. He was so friendly, fun and knowledgeable. Food was great, try the shrimp taquitos. Can't wait to go back for the fresh lobsters and oyster bar. They also have a great assortment of cocktails!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have driven by this restaurant so many times and never went in until last week. We wanted to give it a try since it is near a lot of our other favorite restaurants in Tempe Marketplace.  When we walked in on a Saturday night it was not too busy which surprised us a little. We did notice they have a private dining room. And that was not in use. I would say it was about 60% at occupancy.  The patios were totally empty but it is still 100 degrees or warmer still.  We were given a large booth that was way too big for just two of us so we asked for something smaller. We were approached fairly quickly. Our drink orders were taken and for me drinking water it was not easy to get refills as much as I wanted. That was the only bad thing about the meal.  We got lots of bread and butter. That was nice. I ordered the Fish and Chips and they good. Not great, not terrible. Nothing new and exciting. The fish was great underneath the breading. It was a bit mushy and next time I would order it crispy. My husband had the cajun dish which he liked and had lots of flavor.  The ambiance was nice. Service was goof. Some food things could have been better. If you like fish try this place."}
{"text":"I was rather disappointed with the prices and services given the reviews. The food was good but nothing to write home about. The fish was dry and our Mac n cheese was cold.  When we ordered our final rounds, the wait time was excessive. To compensate, they offered a free desert. We were informed after the fact about price changes for our cocktails which were outrageous. We had double shot beverages and were informed after our bills came that we would be charged for separate shots which cost more than the drink itself. Considering you couldn't taste the liquor this was rather upsetting. The manager put blame on the waitress for not telling us ahead of time. Poor thing didn't see that bus coming."}
{"text":"our family stopped in at 8pm on february 10th.  there was no wait and a few folks eating in the restaurant.  we were sat very quickly.  our server, cody, was awesome.  we ordered coconut crusted wild ecuadorian mahi mahi, wild baja californian yellowtail, wild alaskan red king crab and southwest salad.  we loved all our meals!  we did not have any problems with our order.  our meal for 2 adults and 1 child was around $41.  the restaurant is very nice inside but it was disturbing to see so few people inside.  so we had a great quiet dinner.  for the record parking and traffic sucks real bad at this restaurant location in the tempe market place."}
{"text":"We were fans of the Fish House in San Diego, so we were thrilled when we found this one while visiting Tempe!   Amanda was the best bartender/waitress.  She was interesting and made our dining experience even better!  Definitely recommend this place.  Ask for Ananda!"}
{"text":"I don't eat seafood much, and never before at a fancier, seafood-specific place like this. Although our waiter was friendly and generally on top of it, I was pretty disappointed by the food. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that the fish is fresher than I could get elsewhere (though I couldn't really tell), but the portions didn't match the price, and the fish was poorly seasoned. That being said, the sides I got (mac and cheese, grilled zucchini) were deeeelicious."}
{"text":"Gonna Have To Do 3 Stars.     After earning our meal by doing a few miles of fast paced hiking over at Papago Park earlier in the evening, my wife & I decided to check out King's which, for some reason neither of us can remember, we both already had bookmarked on Yelp.  We were in the mood for seafood and had some cod at home ready to be prepared, but decided we were hangry enough to just jet over to King's to spend what ended up being $150 for a mediocre dinner.  While we always enjoy each other's company when out and about, kind of wish we had just gone home.    Started with the Oysters Rockefeller, which was tasty.   Everybody seems to do Rockefeller differently, and King's prepares it with what I think is sort of Hollandaise sauce on top.  I liked it.    I then had the King's Spicy Seafood Chowder which was awesome and hearty.  One could do a bowl of that and a salad and call it a meal, honestly.  Very good.    I then had the \"Fish House Favorite\" Macadamia Nut Encrusted Alaskan Halibut.  It was done nicely, and was a truly ample portion of Halibut.   But there was no evidence of an \"orange ginger butter sauce\" and I'm not really sure how to describe the flavor other than just sort of \"blah\".   Not impressive, especially at $31.  On the other hand, the dish came with two sides, so I had garlic mashed potatoes and mac&cheese.  These sides were both delicious - they do a really nice job with these two sides and the portions of both were also ample.    I try to keep Yelp reviews limited to my food / my experience and not that of other people in my party, however, I have to factor my wife's experience into this one.   She ordered the Filet Mignon (med-rare) and South African Lobster Tail combo.   Her lobster tail was huge and delicious, but her filet was overcooked and I think it was a bad cut of meat in general as it was extremely dry even though it looked like it was a solid medium in the middle.  Per the restaurant policy, they \"unconditionally guarantee their product\", so upon pointing out that the steak was overdone, our server immediately offered to have a fresh cut prepared.    It was better, med-rare in the middle but still overdone closer to the edges -- but at least much more juicy throughout than the first cut.   To her further chagrin, she also found that her large baked potato was raw in the middle.  She did not send it back or mention it because by this time we were basically done with our meal.   I had a single beer from one of my favorite breweries -- North Coast Brewing Scrimshaw Pilsner -- something that's not common here in the valley, and she had a glass of the Nielsen Pinot.   So, the good -- Oysters, the chowder, my sides, her lobster, our drinks. The not so good -- my entree, her filet, part of her side, and the cost of our all-told mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I came in and we had a waitress named Teresa, she was the best server we have ever had. From the moment she came to our table she lit up the room with her smile and made our experience there personal. From the fish and chips to her warm welcoming personality, our experience was 110% excellent.  Even if the food wasn't good, I would go back just to have Teresa serve me again. She was absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here a while back and wont go again! She had a burger that was OK. I was the one that had all the problem! I ordered the fish with the side of mac. and the oyster sampler. The oysters were good but way over priced for the 8. My food got there at last and the fish was around a 3 oz portion which the waitress pointed out that I had a bigger portion coming! Why the hell would they even send it out if it wasn't right? I at my two bites of fish and while I was waiting for the rest of my missing fish I try ed the mac. I was old and dried out. I sent it and they brought me another portion that was nearly as bad. By this time my wife was finished with her food and I still waited.I finely got the attention of one of the wait staff (I hadn't seen my waitress for a while) and asked when the rest of my fish was coming? No one knew what I was yalking about. They hunted down my waitress, the girl who brought me the skimpy order and the manager. By the time it was all straightened out we were ready to leave. They comped the fish but for the burger and the oysters and a couple of beers the bill was still over fifty! I wont be back!   I have to now give praise to the Fish House! I first posted my thoughts on a food blog and never had a response. Once I posted on Yelp I received several e-mails all from different individuals voicing their concern about my experience at Kings! I have to say that my opinion has changed drastically about this establishment! If I get a response of concern like this from just my complaint I feel that they really do care about everything related to their establishment and have to give them cu dos and high marks! I will continue....."}
{"text":"I am giving King's Fish House three stars on customer service and that is about it. After my last review on our poor experience on Mother's Day I was contacted by the manager Kari. She was very nice to have offered to correct the situation and to give King's the chance to correct the problems that we experienced on our last visit.  We arrived tonight around 5:45pm. We were promptly seated and our server arrived within minutes of us being seated. She was very nice and attentive. I asked her how the mojitos were and she suggested that I get one. Unfortunately I would have to say the mojito was probably the best item of the night. My fiancé ordered the filet cooked medium and I ordered the King's combo (fried shrimp, fish and scallops). The shrimp were pretty good, the fish was okay and the scallops were just the same as the last time I reported, gritty. My fiancé's steak was severely under seasoned and had no flavor at all. He also got a baked potato which instead of being overcooked (previous visit) it was cold in the middle. I got coleslaw and corn as sides. The corn was good but the coleslaw had no flavor at all. For the prices that are charged at this restaurant I cannot believe the quality of food.  I am sorry to say that I will not ever be back here. Thank you Kari for the opportunity to make things right but unfortunately I think the quality of food is out of your hands."}
{"text":"Sometime I wonder what happened to Bennigans...and now I know: it's come back as King's Fish House.  And in case you aren't getting the profuse, dripping sarcasm, that's no compliment.   More expensive, far more pretentious, so average yet aims so high.  My food was very, very average. Best thing was the grilled asparagus but balsamic and Parmesan is something I can do myself. Fish was blah. Really. While I certainly didn't ask anyone to taste my fish, I'm telling you, no one you or I know would have sampled my fish and exclaimed, \"God, this is good!\" because it wasn't. It was BLAND. No smoke flavor, no benefit from plank-cooking. Really, the problem was:                       NO FLAVOR.   And they're not giving anything away. Let me put it to you this way: as I was walking out I passed a 12-top, 12 folks chomping away at a variety of seafood, and all I could think of was the guy who signs that check for $900 is not going home happy. It's a friggin' Bennigans and now it's a $1000 bucks.  Oh, and one more thing: maybe could you let the staff at King's Fish House know:  per State Law: you are not once allowed to touch face/hair/each other while serving food?  Good Lord!  How do you get a foodhandlers card in Maricopa County and not know this?  Hmmm.  Somehow King's Fish House employees missed these memos. Sheesh. Or worse. Its disgusting and I saw at least half a dozen crewmembers ignore this strict food policy.   HAND CONTAMINATION  IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF  FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS. Fact.   IF YOU TOUCH YOUR FACE OR HAIR YOU MUST WASH     Slow Service.  There wasn't one thing, not one instance I encountered in my visit that could've been defined as \"prompt\". Doesn't the word \"tip\", stand for \"to insure promptness\"? Kinda does.   And one more thing, (again): fix your website. I hit \"contact us\" and got the recipe page. I hit the recipe page link and got recipes. The prices on the menu were not at all current.  IN OTHER WORDS, WHY ISN'T ANYONE AT BENNIGANS, errrrr, KING'S FISH HOUSE -- paying attention to your website?  And one more thing: do ya just take any image, of anyone, anything, put a frame around it, and hang it in the wall?  Is that interior decorating nowadays?  Because they've got stuff on the wall that is so random, so arbitrary, so busy, so nothing-to-do-with-fish, it's not so much \"odd\"as it is just so ordinary. No one, not even King's Fish House, aspires to ordinary.   So average. Slow service. Buy somebody else's Groupon...or just go around the corner to Portillos. This place blows."}
{"text":"I love writing a review on seafood-specialty restaurants.  I am deathly allergic to shellfish, so I'm impressed when the staff takes note and ensures that my meal will not result in a call for paramedics.  (Please note - I take the risk because I can eat fish - just not shellfish.)   Our department held their holiday lunch here - great day for patio seating (heaters and wind shields in place made it bright, cheery and comfortable).  GREAT place for a group of 40.   They had set up a special menu for us with 4 soup/salads, 4 entrees and 2 dessert options.  I ordered the Caesar salad, blackened tilapia, and apple cobbler.  I loved that our server checked to make sure that I was good with anchovies in the salad dressing, and ensured me that my food would be prepared in a way not to cross-contaminate with the shrimp orders.   The warm loaves of bread were a big hit with the group.  Those who opted for the seafood chowder and clam chowder really seemed to enjoy them. My meal was perfect - a generous order of fish, seasoned perfectly; grilled zucchini slices and creamy potatoes.  I ate every bite.  My cobbler had the right amount of ice cream.   Great service, good food, and great location."}
{"text":"I contemplated writing this review for a VERY long time. My last review was a bit scathing, however the manager asked me about my experience and so I decided to give it another go.  Pros: Good service, great bread, AMAZING oysters  My family shared Fanny Bay oysters and they were absolutely wonderful and plated beautifully. The mignonette was also amazing and had a very nuanced flavor. If I come back, it will be for these oysters.   After our appetizers things started to go down hill a little bit. To sum up all our dishes- every fish dish was overcooked. Fish is a delicate protein and should be cooked that way. It shouldn't have a texture that resembles chalk. Besides the fish, everything was quite nice (the sides were tasty). For around $20-$25 dollars per plate, it is not worth it. Portions are also small but it wouldn't have mattered if the food was good-which it wasn't.  The manager obviously cares for this restaurant a lot, unfortunately the chef does not. The seafood is obviously of great quality, and it is truly unfortunate that they have been destroyed by not being cooked correctly. I would only recommend this place perhaps for lunch or if you just want to get some drinks with friends because the bread, service, and oysters were well worth the price tag. Don't come here for anything that is cooked."}
{"text":"The service is great but the food was bland and nothing special. The prices were okay and the portions big enough that I had some leftovers for lunch the next day. Had high hopes due to the location and limited seafood options around the city but one trip was enough for me."}
{"text":"It is definitely time to update my review.  The hubs and I decided to give Kings Fish House another try after having a mediocre previous experience and I'm so glad we did! Not only was this visit better than the last, but it exceeded our expectations.  It started off with Timber, our server, who was exceptional.  She was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was willing to explain anything we needed to know, always with a smile on her face.  When she asked if we would like a salad before our meal, she could see us contemplating and suggested that we share a salad...perfect! She also brought it out on two separate plates so that we didn't have to do it ourselves.  Timber kept our glasses filled during the entire meal and was attentive but not overbearing.  She was great!  The manager, Patrick, also visited our table to make sure that we were enjoying ourselves and had everything we needed.  The staff at this location was excellent and it is obvious that they care about their guests.  On to the food...we started off with the sourdough bread.  It came out warm and was fresh and delicious.  We then split a caesar salad.  Again, fresh and yummy.  Then, the entrees came.  We both ordered the blackened salmon.  I opted for grilled zucchini and glazed carrots for my sides while the hubs asked for the buttered corn.  OMG...we love to smoke our salmon at home but we both agreed that this was by far the best salmon we've ever had at a restaurant.  It was that good! In addition, the sides were just as enjoyable.  Super flavorful and cooked just right.    I'm so glad we didn't give up on Kings Fish House.  This visit was amazing and we will definitely be returning for some more of that salmon!"}
{"text":"Eaten at their location in long-beach, CA on many occasions this location I would say to be slightly better I like the blue cheese candied walnut salad (on a diet) the shrimp cocktail was excellent (ok I was a little bad with my diet) I had to have the key lime pie (it's tart, but oh so sweet!)"}
{"text":"King's Fish House is a chain restaurant.  Not as big as McCormick & Schmick's.  They have locations in CA, NV, and AZ for now.  It's located in the Tempe Marketplace which is always super busy but that's not a problem.  Actually the first time we went to King's Fish House, we liked it so much we decided to come back again the next day!  The seafood here is GREAT!  It's so hard to find a place for good seafood.  I actually prefer King's Fish House more than McCormick & Schmick's!  They have something for everyone even if you're not in to seafood.  But if you are they even have sandwiches, sushi, oyster platters, and pasta.  I learned from my first time here that their portion sizes are pretty big, so when we came back a second time we shared one of the plates haha.  Well we shared our sides, we each got our own plates.  Also the calamari is a good choice for appetizers!    The restaurant overall is not too bad.  We came here in a group of 8 and they easily accommodated us last minute.   And our server was on top of everything with orders, drinks, knowing who got what.  Great customer service!  Also they sometimes have good deals where you buy their giftcard and a bonus gift card."}
{"text":"We have dined at King's Fish House in Southern California, have had  good experiences there, so, thought we would try it in Tempe with some friends.  Boy we were disappointed with the entire dining experience! ...  with the exception of the sourdough bread. The Server that asked for our drinks was dull, & when asked how late they were open, was happy her shift would be over soon  --  the Server who brought our food - seemed bothered that she had to wait on her customers, no smiles anywhere & when we asked questions about the menu the answers were short & curt. The wild shrimp was not fresh,  sauteed spinach too much garlic.  When asked our friends how their meals were one said he enjoyed the trout almondine, others were so, so - disappointed the scallops were small - which our Server told us was because they were not in season.  We had to flag a server down to ask for something  - seems all held their heads up in the sky instead of looking around for their customers inquiries or needs.  When we inquired about  the salted caramel ice cream for dessert, we were informed that it is only available in the summer and had to coax our Server to tell us what else was available, again she seemed very bothered. We will not be back - not any of us, will visit this place only on our trips to Southern California. Perhaps they should have the Employees in Calif. train the Servers & Chefs in Tempe."}
{"text":"I am really not a fish person, in fact I never eat it. But, Cassie was super patient and helped me figure out what I was going to be able to handle and I was actually very satisfied with the salmon!"}
{"text":"I was meeting two of my employees to have a lunch meeting, and this place was recommended by a colleague.  Anyways as soon as I walk in I got ignore, I have to ask if I needed to seat my self then she said \"oh you are waiting\" (with bad attitude) I almost say no I just here for decoration, duh of course I was waiting. So she took my name down, less than one minute after few people walk in and she greet them with a smile and ask of two or more, so they got a table.  We got our table, thing change here our server was nice, attentive and give us recommendations.  The 3 starts is for the first people when you walk in, customer service needs to improve or I do I need to change the color on my skin.  God we are in 2014!!  Our server was nice, food was good."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was awesome! Thanks for making our Father's Day awesome with a perfect lobster dinner. Props to our server Raeshel!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so bad as I love seafood and want a wider selection of restaurants to go to that serve good seafood. After a bad experience in their Carlsbad location, our family decided to give the Tempe location a try on a Saturday night. One star is for our reservation on Opentable because we were seated upon arrival. The second star is for our server. Now comes the food--- my 4 yr old loves calamari so we always order it. The Tempe location does have better Calamari than the Carlsbad location. We also ordered a bowl of clam chowder, popcorn shrimp for my son and my husband ordered the scallops and shrimp platter. Everything we ordered was much better than our previous experience at their Carlsbad location. However, the portions suck!!! The clam chowder should be called bacon soup as it had more bacon than anything else. But then again, that's what probably made the chowder good. The popcorn shrimp was good. There were plenty of tiny shrimp for a 4 year old to eat.. But considering it was served on a huge platter, the cook could have at least filled it with more fries. Like seriously there were probably 25pcs of tiny overcooked fries on that plate. Now comes the scallops and shrimp with a side of zucchini. Unfortunately my phone's battery died before I could take a photo of my husband's plate. But let's just say for $25 for his order, we could have eaten somewhere much MUCH better. His huge platter came with 3 tiny scallops. Not exactly bay scallops but definitely NOT quality ones either. 5 pieces of small shrimps and 3 pieces of overcooked zucchini. Seriously, we've had more veggies than that at a fine dining restaurant. Our bill was $70- something.. We don't usually mind paying for good food but this time we felt like we wasted our money. Sorry King's fish. We will never go back."}
{"text":"Wife and I stopped off at this restaurant for our date night.  The Last time we were there, I asked Michelle, the general manager, when they would have dungeness crab. She said to drop her an email and she would let us know. In mid April I received an email describing the two crab dishes.  Tonight we both both ordered the steam dungeness crab which comes with 2 sides. Started off by splitting a Cesar Salad. The romaine lettuce was cold and crisp with some type of anchovie  dressing. Yummy, that started off our fabulous meal. The crab comes with crab butter which is very flavorful. You have to crack the legs and separate the meat from the body, but HEY, that's what eating dungeness crab is all about. I would get as much meat in the crab butter before tasting it. Working too slow causes the sides and crab to cool down. My side of asparagus was cooked on the grill and was OK, thought it was slughtly overcooked and the baked potato was the way I liked it.  The meal was very filling, so come with an appetite. Restaurant is always clean and our server was knowledgeable  and attentive. Michelle also advised us that they we be serving Soft Shell crab by the end of the month. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had the Parmesan Crusted British Columbia Sanddabs.  Eh.  Too much parmesan crust that I couldn't really taste the actual fish itself.  Had cheesy grits as a side - bleh.  From the taste of it - the cheese was somekind of processed velveeta like cheese.  Yuck.  What I thought was really good was the grilled zucchini.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"It's been a few years and honestly I can't remember what everyone ordered.  I do remember eating Coconut Mahi Mahi and it was very good.  I would be willing to go back and try some other menu options, though it didn't stand out to me as amazing."}
{"text":"Cassie was awesome! She has a great personality and we enjoyed having her serve us. On top of great service the food was just as awesome as usual!!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Seafood was incredible! Service with a smile! Even their hot wings are phenomenal! You have to get their butter cake!!! Best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I tried the New England calm chowder and it's excellent! Loaded with clams and creamy.  I had the Louie Salad which my server, Maya, helped me choose. It was excellent, also. My server was awesome and very helpful,  even with my wine selection.  I typed it all off with the butter cake, another great recommendation by my server."}
{"text":"Kings is one of my favorite go-to lunch spot.  Tried something new today (Sand Dabs) at the suggestion of Cassandra!  Thanks so much for the great service and recommendation!  Another great meal."}
{"text":"Wandered in on a Sunday night.  The place was darn near empty.  Settled in at the bar. Claire was our bartender.  She was fantastic!  We decided to just order a series of appetizers while enjoying some cocktails and the Sunday night sports.  Oysters on the half shell sampler were pretty good. A little on the small side. I prefer the bigger ones personally.  Next were the Blackened Shrimp Taquitos. These were tasty. Good flavor and crunch. The Baked Penn Cove Mussels are a must. A different twist on traditional baked mussels.   We decided to venture into sashimi and a roll.  The sashimi was average at best.  The Lobster Crunchy Roll was a score! We went back to shrimp with the N'awlin's BBQ Shrimp. The shrimp was good but the real treat to this dish is to dunk the bread into the sauce and then place the tomatoes on the bread similar to bruschetta. That was a home run!  Don't forget the Butter Cake!!"}
{"text":"I just had dinner and here tonight and I have to say it was quite unexpected! The food was delicious and our server Kim was just awesome! I had the wild salmon with zucchini and wild grains, sooo yummy! Kim suggested the butter cake and I don't know if I'll be returning strictly for the butter cake or  to have Kim as a server again!"}
{"text":"First time having a bad experience. Received bad calamari and everything went down hill from there. Tried to make the best of it, but since it was early and only a couple of other tables seated, didn't have good food or great service."}
{"text":"We went here for an early dinner after some retail therapy in Tempe Marketplace. It was not very crowded for a Sunday evening and we took a booth near the Bar.The interiors are warm and welcoming.Service is friendly but a little laid back.  We just had some Beer (Indian pale ale) and cocktails.The Cosmopolitan was pretty basic nothing extraordinaire! I did like the King's Combo Platter it had Shrimp,scallops,Fish(Cod) with coleslaw and fries with 2 types of dips.The fries can be substituted for mash potatoes or a bunch of other stuff.The scallops and shrimp were crispy and breaded well but the Cod was not crispy and had a little too much oil.  They serve sourdough bread on the table.They also have beautiful outdoor seating. The menu does have a lot of options which i would like to try. Overall it wasn't that Bad and i would go again to check out the Mains.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time a couple of nights ago and can say that I was very impressed!   I like to come through places like this and tune into a sporting event over a drink and conversation with friends of mine, so the bar is generally our scene. We had an appetizer and a couple of drinks and I can honestly say that if you're thinking about swinging through here, you won't be disappointed. It's a great environment and Gilbert did a fantastic job, I never once felt like I wasn't being attended to in an exceptional manner. That being said, I can't speak for the rest of the restaurant, but I can say that in past experiences, a great bar means a great restaurant, as the bar is often times the busiest and hardest to manage. I attribute this solely to a great bartender with a good personality who has an understanding for his / her job, and isn't there merely for looks.   In the end, I'm sure the entrees are great, but all we had were some appetizers and a few drinks, of which I was very pleased with the quality of and beyond pleased with the quality of the staff. In my opinion, hire more people like the bartender Gilbert, as the staff can set the tone right from the start.   King's Fish House, \"I'll be back\" *Arnold voice*"}
{"text":"King's Fish House provided a nice fish option in Tempe.  I used to go to Rockfish in Chandler, but I believe that closed.  I am not that big of a fan of fish, but my cardiologist is, so here I am looking for fish.  I liked the atmosphere of the place - dead fish on the wall, jazz lightly in the background and napkins with fish caricature napkins. The menu was very big and apparently printed every day as it had the date printed on the menu.  That might be a little costly from an operations standpoint, but it was a cool touch.   I started with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder ($3.95) and my friend the lobster bisque cup ($5.45). The lobster was a little high for a cup, but both soups were excellent. My friend ordered an Arnold Palmer ($3.95) to drink and it was commented to me that it wasn't very good in comparison to other places. I had the diet coke ($2.95).  I ordered the wild salmon for $12.75 and my friend had the rockfish for $11.95. Both of us chose the sautéed spinach. I had the rosemary potatoes and my friend the garlic mashed potatoes. The food was fine - it was fish and there's only so much you can do with a piece of grilled fish.  I did order dessert - the fruit crisp ($6.95). I was a little disappointed that the option of the day was peach. Peaches , oatmeal and vanilla ice cream...surprisingly it was excellent! Really the best part of the meal. I would have liked to see the peaches maybe cut because it was challenging to dig in and reel in a big peach.   The service was excellent. My server Katie was cool, very nice and prompt.  It was a good meal if you want fish - but  maybe $ 51 for lunch is a bit too high."}
{"text":"It seems that when we are looking for fresh fish, King's is the go-to place. I think we've been to King's at least five times this year and have tried several of their selections. Always have a great variety of fresh oysters on the half shell....some of our favorites are always on the menu. The menu changes daily, depending on the fresh deliveries of fish. The sushi menu is surprisingly extensive....the ahi poke is expertly prepared and delicious. We like to try other seafood restaurants around the valley, but when we don't want to take a chance.....King's is always dependable."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Came here after the movies for happy hour - sat at the bar! Bar is fabulous! Made perfect by Gilbert's outgoing, friendly personality! He's also very knowledgable of the menu!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Dined here and had another phenomenal experience. Service was great and it seemed like the entire wait staff/server staff/busser staff was in synch. I always appreciate it when staff at restaurants are all willing to help, regardless of their \"job\". It's not often that I crave a fish dinner, but when I do, I can count on King's Fish House to hit the spot. The food is good, the service is good, and the atmosphere is great. I would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"It was ok seafood. Real unimpressed by chewy calamari overly fried with dipping sauce that is ketchup with a bit of cayenne pepper- gross. Calamari best cooked is lightly fried, with a butter garlic sauce, porchini pepper rings, and a zesty marinara sauce. It also shouldn't be tough or chewy it should melt in your mouth. I had a shrimp in marinara and it didn't have much flavor. This isn't one of the better chains at Tempe Markerplace. I won't be coming back here. I'm from New England so maybe I'm picky...."}
{"text":"All kinds of seafood choices from sushi and raw bar to fried or grilled. I suggest you try the macaroni and cheese for a side or the New Orleans spicy shrimp. The wait staff is attentive and even brought warm wet napkins with lemon to clean up your hands."}
{"text":"Valentine's dinner... we were hopeful that the food and experience would be memorable and we were not dissapointed! From the warm sour dough bread, great cocktails, Merlin our waiter was delightful, clams and trout almondine...yummy!  Atmosphere is great, and we'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"OMG. Had the lemon-nut crusted sea bass with grilled zucchini and sauteed spinach. The fish was cooked to absolute perfection and the veggies were so fresh and seasoned just right. I am HAPPY to have found Kings and will be back when I am in Tempe again!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good.  Had shrimp angel hair pasta and oysters. Food was great.  Want to try sushi next time.  Service was decent.  Wasn't busy and service was still really slow. If service was better I would give this place a 5 star"}
{"text":"Love dis place. Ashley P in the bar is fabulous. She a redhead after my own heart. Come wine and dine. You will be happy you did."}
{"text":"A decent dinner. Nothing especially stood out, but nothing was wrong, either.  The restaurant was quite crowded; we didn't realize there was a major sporting event the next morning and 100,000 people were carb loading for the marathon. The wait was still only 10 minutes and service was quite good. My biggest issue was that a lot of the space smelled like fish. Husband said, \"It's a fish house,\" but no, it shouldn't have a fishy smell!  Husband ordered a hazelnut encrusted salmon and I had the trout amadine. The fish was perfectly cooked. His was sweet in a sort of surprising way. My fish didn't have a lot of flavor, except what came from the sauce. Sadly, there was not enough sauce to cover the ends of the fish.   I like that you can choose your sides. I had mashed potatoes (good) and spinach (they give you a lot but it's not really seasoned; should have used salt and lemon). Didn't taste husband's but he had zucchini and ratatouille.  There's a lot to get into at this place. Like I said, quite decent."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 server was friendly, honest and very helpful Food: 4/5 food was good but too expensive for what you were getting.   All together we ate ciopinno, grilled salmon with sides, and med pasta with swordfish"}
{"text":"We wanted lobster and remembered this restaurant from Southern California so thought to give it a try. We were seated promptly and served warm sour dough bread very quickly. The oysters were fresh but very small and at $13 for a half dozen not a great value. But the main event, we loved the steamed lobster. It was fun and our professional friendly server let our 9 y/o pick our fresh lobster. The bar was nice and it seemed like a fun place to gather after work."}
{"text":"Met a client here for lunch yesterday. We were seated promptly and our server, Katie, was great. My client had a burger and I ordered the scallops. Our lunches were out within 15 minutes and we snacked on the warm bread and butter while we chatted about business. This is a nice, little more upscale place to meet for lunch if you want an upgrade over the normal fast food type establishments. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the grilled zucchini was especially nice with a seasoning that I was not typical in other places that I have been. I also had the mac n cheese and it was obvious that it was freshly made. My client said that she really enjoyed her burger and sweet potato fries also. (maybe it was a little extra good because I was paying ;O)"}
{"text":"I am a fan of King's I had the beer battered fish and chips and it was pretty good The fish was cooked well and the chips (fries) were fresh I also chose a Mac n cheese as a side  And it too was scrumptious, reminded me of Sauce's Mac n cheese They have a pretty good beer selection I went for the King's blonde ale and again, another good choice  On my next trip I plan on trying the sushi!"}
{"text":"I was so happy to see a King's Fish House in Tempe during my recent visit to the area.  I have been to the one in Long Beach and Rancho Cucamonga and love their food!  I ordered the three oyster shooters first. They came with grated horseradish on top--it is NOT cheese!  So I stirred that into the shooter and shot it. Oh so good!!!  For my entree I ordered the Wild Jumbo Shrimp and Lump Crab Meat Salad.  The shrimp and crab were really good, but I was surprised to see chunks of carrots and celery--the celery appearing to be the dry ends of the stalk which I gently removed.  How weird to have big pieces of carrots and celery on what I considered to be a shrimp and crab Louie.  It was good, but I (obviously) was a little too hung up with these other two items to really enjoy it.  Service was nothing outstanding which is typical by today's standard.  I'll go back, but I'll tell them to leave the celery and carrots off."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE!!! Truth be told, I was raised to believe I was allergic to shellfish. Now I am addicted and love anything that's sea, to be more specific: Lobster and Crab. I have been coming to Kings Fish House for years. During the last few visits we got Cassandra (Cassie) as a waitress. I have to say that I have travel extensively, and living in the desert can be quite scary when it comes to fresh fish. Cassie has been awesome and patient to bring our 5+ lobsters per sitting and a few dozen oysters per sitting  (for only two people) and always great quality that totally taste fresh ñ. We can not recommend this place enough. This last occasion we got Kaylin as our server. We remembered her from our last time that we visited, since she was the covering manager. I have to say that she is another amazing waitress with superb customer service skills. Very professional to say the least. Now we have two awesome servers to come visit and more breaking records to look forward with amazing lobster to come. Maybe we will do 6 lobsters and 3 dozen oysters next"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here. the first was about three years ago. I remembered the first time I wasn't really disappointed but really wasn't impressed; especially with the portion size for the price. Time has gone by and Jen and I figured why not try it again.   Jen ordered the Barcat Oysters and really liked them. We also ordered Crab Cakes as appetizers. I was a little disappointed in the Crab Cakes.  Breaded and fried like typical cakes. they were good and the sauce accompanying them was also good. Unfortunately, all crab cakes we eat will be compared to the cakes we had in Sedona at Creekside (see my review and pics).  That was at a breakfast type restaurant and you would think a place with Fish House as part of it's name would be able to blow you away with their version. $12 and the portion size also was lackluster.  For entrees Jen order the Yellowtail Carpaccio and I ordered the Sea Scallops.  Jen said it was ok. The mash potatoes as one of my sides and.was very gritty which means they were overcooked.  The Mac and Cheese was, well, Mac and cheese. They do sprinkle it with panko breading which I like cause it gives a nice crunch. Portion size on the scallops was ok but they were a little small for sea scallops; quantity of 8.  They were good but a little overcooked on one side to the other.  I told Jen were just going to Costco for seafood from now on because we can't find a REALLY good seafood place around Phoenix.   Bill was $75 and for what we got was too high. We ate at The Keg on Chandler Blvd. a week ago and both had prime rib and a scallops app and it was $10 less.  I don't mind paying top dollar for good food and service but I want to get what I pay for.  On a final note, our server Korey was really friendly and very helpful when I asked questions about menu items.  He was also very attentive and probably the only highlight of our experience there."}
{"text":"This must be my mothers favorite restaurant considering we've had her birthday dinner here a few times.  I love the décor, it's location, and the food here is delicious.  Considering we're in Arizona, the fish is excellent, and each dish I've had over the years has been spectacular.  It's no wonder mom wants to go back year after year. come for the bread, stay for the fish :-D"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the attention they give to kids menu, ect.  The food is great - I have taken company there twice now and haven't been embarrassed at all by the choice.  Not too expensive but it's not cheap (ambiance, decor) or cheesy looking.  Very nice ( but not over the top) wine list and a good selection of beers and specialty cocktails.  Patio seating is very nice as well."}
{"text":"It's that time of year.... time to figure out what overly priced restaurant to pick out for my office holiday party. Hey, the boss is buyin' not me. :-)  We settled on King's Fish House, and I am glad we did.   We had a reservation for 6pm for 8 people, figuring we would show up early and get our much needed drink on at the bar. They were very slow when we arrived so we has the bar to ourselves. ***Incoming - Reason for the 5 starts*** The bar chairs are the best! Big, cushy and have backs, AND they have hooks under the bar top for my bad. Honestly, this is such a small touch, but some places fail so miserably at these two key elements that I never go back. Seriously though, if you are in the market for a bar with awesome bar seats, you have to go here! It's genius! If your seats suck I wont stay as long, if they are nice I wont want to move, duh!  Back to the matter at hand, we had a drink then sat down for dinner, Chris was our server and we were very pleased with him. *high five to Chris* He went thought the menu very well and explained everything we were unsure about. We started off with a handful of appetizers, a few oyster shooters, the combo plate with calamari and shrimp and crab cakes, and some salads. The shooters were shooters, decent quality, can't really screw them up. The fried stuff was good, but nothing to gloat about. Their ramoulade sauce was awesome though! Even ordered an extra side to go with my dinner. The salads looked ehh underwhelming. The Danish Blue that I got was ok, the highlight was the huge slice of blue cheese it came with, the rest was an after thought.   Everyone got something different for the entrees and I am pretty sure everyone was happy because the chatter was to a minimum while we stuffer our faces. I got the Grilled Salmon with mac'n'cheese and grilled zucchini, excellent all around!  We topped off the nigh with some Creme Brulee..... not too bad. I prefer it thinner then they serve it but I was still in creme heaven.   We were all very happy, great place! Enjoy if you make it in!"}
{"text":"Super-nice staff... our server was attentive and friendly.   The decor/ambiance... well, it looks nice. As we walked up to it, we noticed a very fishy smell - that's never a good sign at a fish restaurant. However, we noticed on our way in that they had some oysters sitting on some ice at the bar and we decided to believe that's where the odor was coming from and not the actual entrees. Our menus were even fancy and clean and had today's date printed on them, so we knew we were getting some fresh shit. Overall, we were pretty impressed.   Now, I'm usually at a loss at fish restaurants since I'm more of a deep-fried cod and chips sort of guy. Most foo-foo fish places think the fish doesn't need any sauces or spices. To me, most fish tastes about the same - like not much. It's all about texture basically. Anyway - I had the Halibut and it was tasty - although a bit dry. It was also pretty expensive for a restaurant located in a mall built mainly for college kids at 26 bucks - though it did come with two \"sidekicks\" (which i assume refers to the fact that they will feel like a baby in your belly kicking your sides and squirming for the rest of the night).  They brought us some bread to snack on and it was great sourdough (the butter pats looked like 6 pack abs). The mac and cheese sidekick was very tasty and the fries weren't so bad. I mean, there's really not much else to say - I got great service and ate my food until I was bursting. The only drawbacks were the price and the Halibut was a tiny bit dry (but still good). I tasted the Salmon as well and that was prepared perfectly (but I don't like salmon).   I like this place better than Wildfish simply because this joint lacks the pretension you get with the type of patron it attracts. King's is very nearly a 5 star... I look forward to hitting this place up for a happy hour sometime to save some bucks. I'm also looking forward to getting some shrimp or scallop dish."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm in Tempe Marketplace, I make it a point to stop in here. Fantastic beer selection and great food!The main reason I keep coming back though is the impeccable service. The bartender Shane is amazing at his craft and always remembers us and our drink choices. I highly recommend trying out King's if you haven't already!!"}
{"text":"How we've lived in the east valley and skipped this place is beyond me. What a gem. Can't find any high quality seafood restaurant better than this. Everything was perfect but of special note was the crusted sand dabs. They serve nice bread with the dinner as well. Nice atmosphere and good service. No need to go to Scottsdale for great restaurants anymore."}
{"text":"I've been driving by this place for a long time every time I go into Tempe Marketplace and was always curious about this place. So today I decided at the last minute to give this place a try.   The place is very modern looking and my son commented that it was something like a boat house. I could somewhat see that with lots of wood and pictures of fish.   Anyways, they started us off with  sour dough bread and butter. I always love sour dough bread and it was very good. For appetizers we had fried calamari and a few cups of clam chowder. The calamari were huge pieces with a very flakey batter on it. Excellent. Really enjoyed it. The clam chowder was gobbled up by my wife without no complaints. I tried it and was pretty good.   For our main course, I had the Ono fish with rosemary potatoes and mac and cheese. Ono fish is somewhat like the swordfish which is a little dry so overall I thought my meal was good. Loved the Mac and cheese with the rosemary potatoes. My wife had the Mahi-Mahi with spinach and carrots. Her meal was really good. This fish was very tender and juicy. Cooked perfect. She enjoyed it. My son had the linguini with clams and he gobbled it up so he really enjoyed it. My mom ordered the full fried catfish and when they say full. They mean full. Head and tail included. Huge catfish which was bigger than the plate but she ate it all and thought it was really good.   So overall, we had a good meal. Service was good. Our server kept filling our water cups up all the time and the food came out in a timely manner. All I can say is huge portions, good food, good service and we will be back again. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great place for fresh seafood or at least many of the choices are fresh daily. We had a very attentive server. The swordfish was excellent as was my sea bass.  Easy to get to from the Casa Grande area, just about a 40 minute drive fro here."}
{"text":"Great service. Staff was super friendly and attentive. Fried food over cooked.. Don't expect to taste crab in your crab cakes. They were deep fried which is a no no especially at fine dining restaurants. Price would have been fair if seafood was fresh."}
{"text":"Let me cut to the chase. Many places sometimes decline in quality with the length of time that I have been away from here. King's has improved in that timeframe.  First, Michelle is now the general manager and still has the same fun, vibrant personality that my wife and I have come to appreciate.  Second, there have been a few new items added to the including a butter cake that will remind you of the St. Louis Gooey Butter Cake.  That cake was so tasty, I had to get some coffee to go with it!    Rest assured, Michelle, we will be back a LOT sooner!"}
{"text":"I was contacted by the manager, Michelle, who apologized for our poor experience and invited us back.  It took a couple months for us to make it back, but our second experience was amazing. We didn't ask to speak to Michelle until after we had already been seated by a friendly hostess, quickly received cocktails from one of the staff helping our server and then been greeted by our server who took our appetizer order. We then met Michelle and she remembered us from our review and was happy to see us back in. Soon afterwards  are appetizers arrived--a delicious sample of oysters on the half-shell--followed soon after (without rushing) by our entrees. They even allowed us to customize a kids meal for our son who is gluten-free. Everything was prepared exceptionally well and was quite delicious. Our waitress checked on us at just the right frequently, Michelle said hello again and we were asked about dessert without it being \"pushed\" on us (we passed as no room after the yummy dinner).  Doggie bags and the check were brought out and handled timely.  We must have just caught people on an \"off\" night last time. We'll be back to King's for sure in the future."}
{"text":"I Should have paid attention to another review, the food was great but the service was absolutely horrible, we sat for 15 minutes before they took our drink order- the funny part was the place was 75% empty, we should have walked out. I stopped a waiter and he said it wasn't  his job??  He could have at least asked if we needed something- very lost  goosie place - they don't give a crap! The whole time we ate we had to get up and ask for drinks- at the end the manager got involved- very nice but too late, we should have gone to our original  place we all wanted- my bad because this was my choice- never again! If that punk worked for me I would fire him!"}
{"text":"Much better this time around.  The GM, Kari, sent us gift certificates after my negative review, with an apology. We gave King's a second chance on Saturday night.  This time, we were seated in the bar area, which had a lot more pleasant atmosphere (less diner-y and loud, with a view through the bar window of the Tempe Marketplace fountain). Our server, Nicole, was much more attentive and pleasant than our last server. She even brought bread out before we even ordered - yay!  The food was greatly improved as well - we didn't order the same things, but usually if a place sucks, it sucks all the way around. Boyfriend did the Captain's Platter (fried scallops and fish) and really liked it; fried without the meat being overcooked, still juicy. I did the Seafood Cobb Salad, and it was really excellent - the shrimp were so flavorful and the salad was HUGE. They did not skimp on any of the ingredients. I'd definitely get it again.  The bread pudding was... different. My other half really liked it (it's drowning in Jack Daniels sauce, of course he did) but the texture was strange to me; reminded me of French toast, it was mostly bread in sauce, not really \"pudding\" to me. It was very good though.  I'm glad to be able to re-write my review positively :)"}
{"text":"Food was excellent and Ashley1 did a super job with our large indecisive party!  I had the swordfish and ratatouille-both delicious .  I'm lactose intolerant and asked for no butter and they were very accommodating.  Again, Ashley was all over it, making sure the spinach was sautéed in oil, not just steamed."}
{"text":"While the service was good that is about the only good thing I have to say. Our meals came out with so much grease on the platters under the French fries we could not eat them. The fried shrimp had so much breading you could hardly find the shrimp. They were also fried far too long. If all you do is seafood, I would expect better all the way around. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Chowder! Nice wine by the glass! Their sushi however is the reason for the 4 stars, I've had way better in this area! Definitely will go again & try something different! Great service!"}
{"text":"The Hostess that was very friendly and happy.  We didn't have the best service but the management went above and beyond to help ammend things.  I was impressed by the managements customer service skills and communication skills.  This is the type of management every restaurant should have."}
{"text":"Mediocre.  This is the 2nd time I've been here this year, and mediocre at best.  Grilled fresh (not farmed) salmon at $30+ and a boiled lobster.  Both were overcooked.  I'm used to salmon having a hot, crisp, seared type of exterior.  This was not that.  No exterior crust, and overcooked almost to the point of being dry.  The lobster was rubbery and tough.  $100+ for two people for a less-than mediocre meal.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Expensive $$$$ but good quality and service. Would visit again for a special occasion"}
{"text":"Went in with my girlfriend.   Place was dead.  Sat at the bar.  The bartender was good and attentive.    My girlfriend and I kissed a few times over an hour during dinner and drinks and conversation.   The very small manager \"Napoleon Syndrome\" came over and asserted himself.    You two are going to need to stop the PDA or you will have to leave.  We have children in the restaurant.    I went to the only table in the place with kids  I apologized to them if they were offended.   They replied we are not at all offended in fact we like our children to see affection. Their is not enough in this world.   We laughed and I walked away and paid my bill for $170 and left the bartender a $40 tip however I will never be back there again due to the managers lack of tact and decency."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time Saturday night.  We got there around 9pm and it was still really busy - we waited in the bar and enjoyed bloody marys and popcorn shrimp. Both were excellent.  Once we got seated (about :30min later) we ordered the breaded halibut and the crab legs. I was impressed by the excellent service and overall food quality. I will definitely return and recommend Kings Fish House."}
{"text":"Came into King's with nothing good to expect considering I am not a big fan of seafood. My family convinced me anyway. When we got there I asked my server if there would be anything I would like at all. She recommended the chicken and steak, and also mentioned the burger and sandwiches. I got the chicken with mashed potatoes and zucchini and really enjoyed it. My parents got the crab legs and salmon and they loved it as well. Denise was overall really helpful and gave us great service, so much so that I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place was really good. For seafood in the middle of the desert this is the place to go. Great clam chowder, good bread and calamari, fresh fish and good service. The interior was very comfortable and the beers were good. This place isn't cheap, but it also isnt too expensive. I like to go here for dinner and a movie."}
{"text":"King's is somewhat reminiscent of New Orleans to me.  It's like a Disney version of New Orleans, not in a bad way but just similar is how Disney takes the best of place and magnifies them while removing the gritty reality that defines them just as much.  I actually really like King's, I wish it were closer to my house because I'd probably eat here everyday for lunch.  What would make this place perfect would be live Jazz and a packed house of half drunk people enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"So we've come here multiple times trying to give it the benefit of the doubt, after tonight we will not be returning. We ordered the Tilapia with Mac and cheese and fries. After the first bite I told my husband, \"This tastes like...\" And he finished \"How our wet dog smells\" which is exactly what it smelled and tasted like. It was horrible! I ate three bites but could not stomach it anymore. We waited for the server to come ask us how it was (usually they do that) but he never bothered to ask and barely even stopped at our table again. You think he would have noticed the barely touched fish on my plate. The fries were also over cooked and the Mac and cheese wasn't good either. We took the leftovers home intending to give it to the dogs and not waste it. But on the way home we both started feeling queasy. He ate more than I did so he felt it more, I'm pretty sure it gave us a small dose of food poisoning, but thankfully we didn't eat much of it. We decided to throw it all away instead of getting the dogs sick as well. We will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for a second time after Michelle, the manager, reached out to me about my fiance and I's last experience. I really appreciated the extra step in her reaching out and inviting us back for a better experience.  We started out with the raw oyster sampler.. delish! I only wish that the waiter would've stopped by and pointed out which was Oyster was which so I could know which ones to order next time. Otherwise, they arrived in a timely fashion and with all the yummy condiment additions.   I ordered the jumbo lump crab small plate as my entree with a side of grilled asparagus. Nice and filling portions of crab meat, drizzled in a spicy cocktail sauce and atop a bed of diced cucumber. The asparagus side is enough to share between people so don't let the price deter you from ordering it..it comes drizzled in soy sauce and breadcrumbs. For you health nuts, my dish left me satisfied without feeling like I busted my diet. Just maybe don't wash it down with 3 glasses of wine like I did :)  My fiance ordered lobster tail and a medium prepared steak with a sides of mac n' cheese and whipped potatoes. He enjoyed everything (he ate the lobster tail in no time!) but the steak which was a bit over prepared and tough.  Our server did a great job all in all, was attentive without being too in our space.   I truly appreciate Michelle going above and beyond to ensure we had a better experience. We will most definitely return to King's next time we are around Tempe and craving some seafood!"}
{"text":"I can eat salmon almost every day, so when I had the hazelnut crusted salmon I was in heaven!  The sides are fresh and the server was pleasant.  I will definitely be back for my salmon fix!!!!"}
{"text":"Over cooked lobster and very fishy mussels and clams. This is the not the first time we've been let down here. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"WOW... being from New England area \"Mass-hole\" , i usually am pretty lenient to places since we are \"land locked\"..  Sourdough bread to start.. hard exterior, did not taste anything close to fresh,, anyways,, looking over the menu, and was a little shocked.. prices higher than \"pappadeaux\" n thinking the food quality better match..  Appetizer PEI mussels - decent flavor , but 1/3 look over dehydrated, almost as if they were dead way before cooking time. or recooked or something,, those we un-edible.  Wife got the clam chowder which was actually really good..  hence 2 stars  I thought, 22 bucks for some scallops,, hmm, let me try that out.. huge plate came out with these little marble sized scallops, 12 of them.. thats almost 2 dollars a piece for each lil scallop, Side zuchini was ok, but the cole slaw definitely not great,, some bites had that sour weird rubberband taste,,  Waitress, awesome, always smiling, refilling our drinks,,   Finished with a $60 bill,, not even close to satisfied and never going back..  If you want seafood on the east valley, go ahead n hit up red lobster, if you want some great seafood, hit up n. phoenix to pappadeaux(worth the drive and time, will never be dissatisfied)  Lesson Learned. :-("}
{"text":"Here for a HappyEvent? Food and service is awesome.  Oysters were perfect and all the dinners were great."}
{"text":"I have been going to King's for a little over a year and normally the overall experience is quite pleasant. Unfortunately my last two visits have been less than ideal. The food was great, the service was good, what was wrong?  The sulfuric odor that managed to fill the entire place. Two visits ago I figured they were having a sewage backup problem which seems to be common in Tempe. I gave it a couple weeks and went back with my family. The problem seemed to be a bit worse, we even tried changing tables to see if it would help. No luck.  We mentioned the smell to the waiter, he hesitated nervously and explained that he couldn't smell anything.  I figure I'll give them a few months and try again."}
{"text":"Please explain how it is unclear that My visit wasn't firsthand when I stated the date and time I walked into the restaurant?  I WALKED INTO THE RESTAURANT AND COULD NOT EAT THERE.  Stop removing a valid post.  If you are ashamed of your corporate practices, change them.  I was a patron.  I have been a patron, this is a firsthand experience.  Let's see, I walked into the restaurant on 3/13 at 2:2 and wanted to meet a friend for lunch.  Until I saw the sign preventing someone from lawfully carrying a concealed weapon therefore I had to abide by the Arizona Law which prevented me from having a delicious lunch.  Then, I posted the below feedback which led to a Yelp complaint where someone said I wasn't a customer.  If walking into the restaurant with every expectation of having lunch was met then seeing a sign preventing me from dining doesn't make me a customer then I am unsure what the term means.  Below was my initial post.  After visiting this restaurant for years, I always enter through the oyster bar door but something told me to check their front door where a sign \"preventing\" guns from being lawfully carried inside hung proudly next to the door.  Not wanting to break the law, I immediately exited.  96% of all mass shootings happen in supposed gun free zones.  The restaurant management has every right to not allow lawful carry inside their restaurant and I will find another seafood restaurant to visit.  I encourage any law abiding citizen to do the same if they practice their 2nd Amendment rights.  Now, before the Yelp content police censor this post, I visited the restaurant and I am expressing my concern with their policies regarding patrons"}
{"text":"Just had one of the best meals of the year! Everything was delicious; from the starter bread to the last bite. The side of coleslaw was absolutely perfect, and would've been a better meal than most places by itself. Lump crab - Amazing, Caesar salad - fresh and crisp. Main course was everything we were hoping for and some. Service was a delight and the atmosphere was alive and well, without being too loud. Can't wait til our next visit."}
{"text":"Man... It took me forever to actually decide on how many stars to give King's Fish House. I finally decided that this place is the best of a bad situation. AZ has zero good seafood, zero! Outside of the Salt Cellar, but I never even think to go to that place. For God's sake the entire thing is a basement with what looks to be an outhouse on top of it. Land Ho.   Anyhow, this, IMO, is some of the most decent fish you can find in the valley. It's incredibly overpriced, and unless you're sitting at the bar, the service just isn't great. If you are lucky enough to time your visit right around when the sourdough loaves come screaming out of the ovens, you're in luck. Fresh bread here is amazing... But wait fifteen minutes, and you are screwed. Stale bread city. The entrees are overpriced and over portioned, but what can you do. Be careful about ordering anything with sauce - your poor little dinner will be drowning in it. That was not an ocean joke. I am being very serious. Ease up on the sauce, King.   NOW!!! The good part. We thoroughly enjoy coming here on Sunday mornings during football season and sitting in the empty bar enjoying oysters on the half shell and beers. This place has a honey beer that is out of this world! You can't get it anywhere else, and that alone is worth the three stars.   So let's recap - bar, oysters, beer = good!! Dining room, stale bread, drowning entrees = meh!!"}
{"text":"Just had a late lunch at King's... the food was amazing, but not as amazing as Kaylin (our server)!! Go here, request her. You won't regret it. Trust me."}
{"text":"A couple of craft brews and the Macadamia Nut Crusted Wild Alaskan Halibut with orange ginger butter sauce. Service was great even for the large group we were. Overall, for a chain restaurant especially, the seafood entree quality was better than expected. I picked the Grilled Zucchini Brushed with olive oil and Grilled Asparagus Topped with balsamic glaze as my two sides and left quite happy. Yes, the Tempe Marketplace is a busy place but at least you can find parking not far away even on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I agree with Alicia, it is a bit pricey here, even for a place nowhere near a fish producing body of water. Back home Cioppino might cost you a little less, even at the classiest place, however I will say its pretty good, but I'd have to wait until I become a millionaire to try it again to indicate any authenticity.   I was just here with a classmate about two weeks ago, and I must say, I was kinda disappointed. I ordered the fried oysters ($16+; I got like 5 small oysters with some fries and cole slaw) which I asked to be fried \"hard\" which I think the cook mistook my request  and thought I wanted to be served the most dried out oysters I have ever had in my life. Our waitress was alright, but she was very slow for a restaurant with only 5 other tables. I don't really appreciate being left vulnerable to choking without a drink to counter it.    I think my first visit here was the best. The oysters, which we got as a appetizer and not a meal, came out great (even with my hard-frying request), the sourdough bread almost sparked memories of bread from home. And the Cioppino was delicious, but the bowl was very shallow and didn't get me messy at all! The bib isn't suppose to be for looks!! Haha, I'm joking with you slightly, but I always remember making much more of a mess with the soup back home. And our waiter was great, very knowledgeable on the dishes and drinks and was charming. I think I enjoyed sitting in the bar section much more than the general dining area.  If I had been able to type up this review after my first visit, King's probably would have gotten 5-stars from me, but blame the dry-ass oysters and the inability for our waitress to not fill my ice tea glass up quick enough to make me give King's Fish House a 3."}
{"text":"$25.50 for a lobster roll that was more potato chips and bread than anything else. Service is horrid. Salad was warm. Hair in Cole slaw. Not impressed!"}
{"text":"Awlful. Place is more than half empty and food still took 50 min to get out. Half the plates were cold from sitting around in the kitchen. Waiter tells us the food was held up because of so many sushi orders at other tables......what orders! This place is empty and the people that are dont have sushi in front of them either."}
{"text":"Wow.  I had a remarkable dinner from start to finish.  There was a generous portion of salad with fresh greens and and home made blue cheese.  The flatware to the stemware were top of the line and the fish was amazing.  Don't forget the butter cake.  The dessert the main courses and staff are incredible."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal here.. We enjoyed the macadamia crusted halibut it was awesome. We had the fish and chips the fish was great but the breaking was a little less than expected we didn't even really complain about it the just noticed we had pulled the breading off and because it was not to our standard they took it off the bill. We had fat astir customer service from Claire and Michael who was training but very personable and attentive. The Manager Patrick came over and talked to us following and was very appreciative of input. We feel the only thing we would change was the restrooms they were clean but had no character related to the rest of the restaurant put some effort into fixtures and decor. Good food excellent selection food prepared to preference."}
{"text":"ANOTHER terrific experience....  Michelle and her staff continue to impress us with terrific service and an exceptional menu. Our most recent dinner was superb; and despite the busy pace of the restaurant, our server kept up nicely, and everything was spot on.  We look forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Terrible two years in a row. Never going back to this location. Served uncleaned squid and tried to say that's how fresh calamari from CA is served.  Seriously?   We are Californians and eat fresh calamari all year long including just a couple of weeks ago at King's in Anaheim.  This comes down to over frying in a thick horrid batter to disguise the fact the chef did NOT properly clean the squid. It's not ticket science. Thanks to last night, it will be sometime before I can eat càlamari again and I was sick to my stomach all night. Upside is they comped our wine and gave us a gift card.  Won't be using it at this location of King's Fish House."}
{"text":"Great experience! Really good food. I don't recommend the grilled artichoke...it was a pain on a date. Not the restaurant's fault. But good prices, good food! I'm not a bread or sugar eater and they totally accommodated! My husband had grilled grouper, I had crab. Both delicious options. We sat outside it was empty and it was like he rented the place out for us! They never even forgot about us!!!"}
{"text":"I had the King's Combo Platter. The Beer battered fish was a little bit salty for my taste but yummy with the tartar sauce. The fried shrimp and scallops paired well with the cocktail sauce. I tried some of the King Crab and it was a mix between Snow Crab and Lobster as the texture was deliciously dense. I also had a cup of Clam Chowder which was buttery and creamy."}
{"text":"Service was ok, food was mediocre, but the prices were outrageous. Over $75 for three double shot cocktails?!?"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a drink and wanted to share a cold seafood platter.  Although everything looked very fresh and our service was very good, the cook who prepared our platter (in front of us, as we were sitting at the bar) completely mutilated our clams and oysters and the crab claws we got were pathetic.  We were there during a shift change and watched the next cook prepare the same platter and I really wish I had been the people getting that one......"}
{"text":"I came here for \"easy hour\" a while back with my ladies and what can I say...  At 5pm on a Friday, business was crazy busy!  We waited around for about 30 minutes before we were seated.  The wait time isn't so bad when you're guzzling pina colados and bloody marys with great company.    When we finally were seated, we ordered two oyster samplers, the baja ceviche fish cocktail, a garden salad with Caesar dressing on the side[my friend is quirky like that], a hot seafood combo, and the macadamia nut crusted Alaskan halibut.  The oysters were delicious and the ceviche was refreshing.  The salad had ranch dressing poured all over it even though we had asked for Caesar dressing on the side.  When we asked our waitress about this, she apologized and said she'll bring us a new salad in 5mins which actually came out 20mins later after a reminder from my friend.  Oh well.  It's just salad and it *was* pretty busy.  The seafood combo was very flavorful and delicious but the biggest disappointment was the overcooked halibut.  I was most excited for the halibut so when I ate a fork full of dried fish, I was pretty sullen.  My overall experience with King's Fish House wasn't too bad but I think I'll just stick with drinks and oysters the next time I stop by."}
{"text":"I'm a seafood lover and being away from the ocean it's hard to find fresh fish and shellfish.  Since I've discovered this place, now I'm a regular customer.  Let's start by saying the seafood is reasonably priced for being fresh and seasonal, and I go nuts for the oyster bar!! They print their menu every day, twice a day. So really you may not find the same seafood selection of the day before. They purchase their seafood from all over the world and I particularly love raw Pacific oysters, with lots of lemon. Raw scallops are also delicious! They are covered with a citrusy light sauce and herbs, perhaps to cover the taste of the seawater.  Get a sit at the bar and let Rudy or Stephen take care of you! They're great!!  Their hot dishes are also delicious, from the clam chowder to the lobster roll sandwich, and even the sautéed mussels were not disappointing.  This restaurant is located in Tempe Marketplace just before Thirsty Lion so parking is not an issue.   I'm so glad I live nearby cause I love oysters and there are not many places in town with such selection and quality!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the waitress was very nice and tried to be accommodating.  Having lived on both coasts, I'm always skeptical of going to seafood restaurants in landlocked states, and have actually had some good experiences, but this place was an EPIC FAIL.  It was way overpriced for th quality and quantity of food provided.  We ordered the crab cakes to start, and they were mostly breading.  I didn't even see any crab, just grayish and mushy-looking filling, so I didn't even try it.  My friend ended up sending them back and just got some grilled shrimp instead.  I ordered the Cioppino, which looked and smelled good when it came, but it had several issues.  It was lacking in flavor, the squid and pieces of fish were ridiculously tiny and the crab legs provided were the legs with the least amount of meat.  For $26, I expected to be impressed.  Waste of money!  My friend ordered the salmon and seemed to be pleased with it, but its pretty hard to screw up a simple salmon filet.  I do not recommend this restaurant at all!"}
{"text":"As always it was awesome!! I'm obsessed with the Kings Albacore roll and the Spicy Crispy Tuna, I highly recommend both! Bartender Brian was very helpful through the menu and I really enjoyed his wine suggestion! The manager stopped by to see how things were and she was so welcoming and a delight to talk to! Can't wait to go back!! Thanks Kings for a great experience every time!"}
{"text":"One word comes to mind: overpriced. Then again, I'm no fish expert and can't really fathom why a pasta dish would reach $30 or why their appetizers can be $12.   The prices for oysters are reasonable. The ones I had just weren't shucked properly. Every one I slurped came with an unexpected piece of shell. It was really a bummer. This place does have a helluva lot of sauces to choose from, though, if you're adventurous.   Their Happy Hour menu isn't anything impressive. Not at all. Yucky American beer, like Bud, counts toward the $3.25 pint. Nothing else does. They do have a great Honey Ale and also offer Moose Drool here, as well as Orion, the best Japanese beer you'll find. And it costs $7.50 for the 22 oz, whereas you'll pay $9.00 for the same at Kabuki.  They also have a short sushi menu. It's not too impressive, but it's enough to pique your interest. I really loved their Rainbow Roll.   Maybe it's b/c we sat at the bar, but we barely got any service. And it began to annoy me. We had to ask for water. We had to ask to order. We had to ask for another 'round. We had to ask for soy sauce trays. We had to ask for just about everything, in fact.   The atmosphere is ordinary - what you might expect from a place called a \"Fish House.\" Nothing really stood out to me.   Would I be back? Uhm, maybe, since they do have a couple good beers available, they serve fresh fish and they have a pretty wide selection of oysters to pick from... I just hope next time they're shucked properly.   I would like to try their King Crab/Shrimp appetizer. It was served to the gentleman beside us. It sounded good on the menu. It looked even better in person.   All in all, an okay place. But again, I think it's overpriced. You can easily walk out of there having spent $40 on a beer, a sushi roll and oysters."}
{"text":"We had our anniversary dinner there, we wanted top notch sea food and boy did we get it!! Our service  was fantastic and our night was topped off with the manager delivering us our desert. She asked how our meal was as well as congratulating us on our special night. I give five stars to the food the staff especially the manager \"Kari\" it showed great hospitality.  Good job Kings Fish House we will be back:)"}
{"text":"A really cool atmosphere, but service could have been better. I went with my fiancé before a movie and they completely messed up her order. Ordered her yellowtail blackened but it came out grilled. Ordered the Zucchini but instead got mac n cheese. The waitress offered to send it back, but we already short on time and I couldn't continue to wait for a new meal.  The food was OK, but it didn't stand out so much to make up for the mixups for the order. Maybe you will have better luck, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great fish house. Not the glitz of Scottsdale but consistently great food. They do it right  . Always fresh and never dry the service is also spot on. I've had several of the fillets , wahoo, halibut, sea bass, yellowtail and always good. Nice down home feel."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  The service is good.  The side items are great.  But the last two occasions I went there the fish was just average.  The prices are a little high for similar restaurants, but, if you need seafood and are at Tempe Marketplace, it's not a bad option."}
{"text":"Relaxed service with excellent waiters and waitress. Andrew was exceptionally attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. Fresh ingredients with thoughtful recipes preparation. Worth the time and money!!!"}
{"text":"Was VERY pleasantly surprised with King's Fish House!   I was expecting this place to be very mediocre BUT I was in the mood for SEAFOOD so we wandered in...  We went later in the evening, around 8 o'clock or so and we could basically have our pick of the place. For your reading enjoyment, we settled on a booth :)  We ordered a sushi roll, the Rainbow Roll to be specific, and it was hands down the best Rainbow Roll I've ever had (and I've been around the block a couple times when it comes to sushi...). I usually put a touch of ginger on every roll I normally consume. This dining experience-ZERO ginger was used! There was no 'fishiness' to the fish and everything tasted so fresh.  We got the Clam Chowder too. AMAZING.   I got the Cioppino. Definitely a GREAT value for the money. The boyfriend got the Fish-n-Chips. The Fish-n-Chips were a little pricey for what was presented, but no real complaints.    For drinks I got a glass of red and the BF had two on-tap brews. The waiter clued us into a special that was going on at the time. Buy a $100 gift certificate and you received a $20 gift certificate complementary.  We were able to cover all that food, drink and tip with the $100 AND we have TWENTY dollars to go back again.  It's like they want to pay me to stuff my face. Thank you Mr. King Fish house :)"}
{"text":"This place is a disgrace. I ordered a dozen of oysters and it was a joke. I came here with my girlfriend and didn't like the size of the oysters. The size of the oysters was as small as my pinky. Never write reviews on Yelp but this one is a must."}
{"text":"I was at Tempe market place with a friend, and we decided to stop at the patio bar for happy hour and oysters . The oyster sampler was amazing ! And so was the bartender Amanda. It was super busy, but everything was great ! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Went for my husband's birthday! There were 14 of us and Casandra offered the best service!! They brought the kids food out first and made sure we had everything we needed. Restaurant has great food and is family friendly! Thanks for a great birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I had relatively low expectations.  However, it was actually pretty good.  Started with the lobster bisque (which they said is seasonal) it was quite good.  Ordered the macadamia nut crusted halibut and the seafood cob salad.  Both were good.    Oddly the place wasn't crowded.  I don't know if that is they way it is or what.  Although if Sunday night was a routine crowd, I'm not sure how they stay in business.  Nevertheless I think we'll be back again."}
{"text":"If your looking for fresh Carb cakes this is the place. They are so good ! I would also say look at eating desert and enjoying every bite. Service with a smile is always a plus"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place when our first choice the Salt Cellar had a 3 hour wait.  We arrived about 6 on a Saturday night to find the place virtually empty, greeted by 2 people at the door, they were pleasant and sat us right away. Waiter greeted us almost immediately with a loaf of sourdough bread. Bread was fresh but cold..would have been so, so much better if it would have been warm.   Husband ordered a lobster crunch roll and a salad to start his meal. The crunch roll was awesome, so very tasty. The salad was one word..meh. Way too much dressing that left the romaine lettuce wilted and soggy, plus the $4.95 price tag was a little excessive for a cup of lettuce, one small tomato wedge and a couple croutons.  Our entrees took FOREVER. The waiter came by several times to fill our drinks and tell us that our food would be out shortly. The couple across from us were seated probably a  good 10 minutes after us, had the same waiter and received their food a good 10 minutes before us. We both ordered the petite filet medium with spiny lobster tail. When our dinner finally arrived my filet was more like medium well and his was medium rare, both lobsters were over cooked slightly. All of the food was tasty just not prepared to our liking. One of my sides was fresh sauteed spinach and it was awesome, garlicky but not to much, the other was a standard baked potato. Husband chose the mac & cheese and coleslaw. Coleslaw was standard deli style, nothing to write home about..neither of us tasted the mac but it did look good, a little on the dry side with a light brown crust.  The meal as a whole was enjoyable taste wise but in all honesty it's just a step up from Red Lobster with a very expensive price tag. For the appetizer, salad,  the 2 entrees and 2 non-alcoholic beverages our tab was $128. Service was good, he refilled our drinks several times and asked if everything was ok..and it was just ok. Restaurant and restrooms were very clean.  I would make a visit back to King's if we were in the area just for that lobster crunch roll, it really was the best part of our meal, but we would probably not make a special trip to go back.  A solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"We had a great Valentines Day dinner at Kings Fish House in Tempe. We had the oyster rockefeller as an appetizer and it was superb.  I had a great martini and my wife enjoyed a glass of their pinot grigio.  We had the wild Alaska halibut and wild Mexican swordfish.  They were excellent and delicious. Having been to Alaska numerous times (my son lives there /USMC), the halibut was as good as we have had up there.  I had requested some flowers for my wife and the restaurant provided her with lovely roses.  Thank you Kings Fish House for making our Valentines dinner very special.  We definately will dine there again during our 2 month stay in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Very helpful staff!  At lunchtime it is pretty much all business meetings going on in there.  The staff was very willing to help people find their party should that need to be done.  Service at the table was good, and the food was great!  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. It's one of only two places I've found that have good oysters. I love the ambiance here, the oysters are top notch (Texas, you need to visit here and learn what a freaking good oyster is), the fries are good, the warm bread is awesome.  They could use some better brews on tap -- good seafood calls for a good beer (e.g. pale ale).  The service was really good, fast, friendly (unlike Hertz).  My first visit, I also had the soft-shell crab. Being from the DC area, I get these whenever I can find them, and King's' was perfect."}
{"text":"This place is OK. I ordered broiled Oregon Red Rock fish, which, the first time it was brought to me, was WAY over cooked.. The nice thing about this place is their service. They were very accomodating, they had no problem redoing my fish. In fact, they brought me a whole new plate! and offered free dessert! (thank you Chris, our server) The second fish, was ok, probably more my mistake for ordering a bland fish (I wanted to try something different) then their cooking methods. But,at least it was not over cooked the second time, but definitly needed salt (and maybe a sauce on the side??)  My husband, however, loved his meal. He had swordfish picatta, which he throughly enjoyed. For the prices on the menu, I did expect more...presentation wasn't exactly bon appetit worthy....If I'm paying so much for a fish, it would be nice to see a little creativity...  I did think it was nice that they print a new menu everyday (check the top right hand corner for the day's date), kind of a nice touch.   To sum up, I give 2 stars for food, 4 stars for service (so I put it in the middle for the rating of this review)."}
