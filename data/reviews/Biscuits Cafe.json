{"text":"Becarful of the email rewards they send you  discounts with no expiration date but they do have a time frame that you find out at the cash register.when it's to late. Confronted the manager and after waiting 10 minutes he pulled up the email rewards for justification of the discount denial.He had no empathy for our concerns!  Lost a long time customer of a few dollars."}
{"text":"Great customer service, delicious food, awesome atmosphere, and super fresh cinnamony cinnamon rolls!!! My new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I ate here Saturday 9:30am. No problem getting seated x 2. Ambience was casual and relaxed, servers were efficient and friendly. Restaurant was clean with clean bathrooms, parking was easy. 
The food. My friend had 2 eggs over easy with bacon and hash brown. There isn't a lot that could go wrong with an order like that and it was well presented. I went for the Biscuits Brisket Benedict with red potatoes. Very bland Hollandaise sauce, potatoes were, potatoes and the brisket some thin sliced deli meat with lots of fat. 
Nothing to get excited about a rather average experience that will not warrant a second visit."}
{"text":"Order the your way got my meal the biscuit was hard my eggs were over done and my meal wasn't hot won't be hoing back there"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my wife. Atmosphere is really nice, quaint. Service was good and very fast. Coffee was OK, had the country omelette and my wife had HAM and cheese eggs. Biscuits are great and the strawberry jam is unreal. I would come back again for the service and the biscuits and jam alone. 

Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Terrible!!!! A party of 5 and everything but the coffee was ice cold.  Will not give it a second try.  Only giving it 1 star because I can't give 0."}
{"text":"I ordered a brisket sandwich and as I bit into the sandwich I noticed that the meat tasted rotton and had a bad smell. I  then called over the waitress and explained to her what I experienced. She took the sandwich back and then returned to tell me that there was nothing wrong with rhe sandwich, making excuses. This is the second time I've had an issue, I had a hair in my food before with similar excuses being made. This is the last time I come to eat here! Gross!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Biscuits on a Sunday at around noon. The place was packed. It only took about 15 minutes to get seated which was nice. Once we ordered we were told the wait for our food would be \"a little longer\" than normal because of the volume of people. We waited at least 30 minutes to get our food. While we were both getting kind of antsy and wondering what was taking so long, once we got our food it didn't matter. Both times that we have visited to food has been exceptional! Definitely check this place out for breakfast/brunch. You will not be disappointed, even if you have to wait a little longer than normal."}
{"text":"Basic breakfast. Large portions; would be nice to be able to order smaller portions at a lower price."}
{"text":"The strawberry jam is delicious on the biscuits. Ask for dry biscuits (sans gravy) and spread on some of that butter and jam!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. the service is speedy and polite. the food arrives quickly. It's delicious: piping hot, fresh, and full of flavor. The side of bacon we got the other day included four thick slices of tender juicy bacon that was cooked just right. The prices are very reasonable too: about $27 total for two, not including the tip."}
{"text":"First time in... Cute place. BUT... The floor doesn't look like it was swept, dead cockroach on floor along with tooth picks and straw wrappers. Washed hands in Restroom? More like sweat room. Why so hot in here? My hands are clean, and I'm back at my table... Food arrived with a long black hair... Somehow it was in my food and connected to my shirt, I hope it was my wife's. Like my wife's hair, I pushed it aside and kept eating... As far as the service, it was good. Didn't keep bugging me. Probably because they were coughing all over the place and on their phones. Never saw the coughing waitress wash her hands though she used her hand as a cough shield.  Whoa a wooly mammoth ... Oh wait it was just a large hairy man removing his sweater and exposing his entire back right in front of me. No need for a sweater in here. Hope he doesn't use the restroom, he might come out naked since it's so hot in there.  I'd rather go to Mike & Rhonda's The Place and wait 45 minutes for a table. Though I never do... Always sit at the counter there.  $2.50 for a coffee, shouldn't have ever seen the bottom of the cup. Luckily another waitress came around to check on me. Kitchen staff guy hit the restroom 2 times in 45 minutes? I'm out of here before I get sick."}
{"text":"Walked here from our place - great location. Great service, no wait.

Had the buttermilk pancakes with over medium eggs - pancakes were just the right flavor and fluffiness and the eggs were done perfectly. My fiancé had the chicken fried chicken and I tried his hash browns (delish) and biscuits (so yummy). The biscuits came with a strawberry jam that tasted homemade and like my grandma used to make. I actually put some of that on my pancakes and it was SO GOOD.

They also gave us chocolate covered strawberries as a nice little extra treat.

Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went for breakfast this morning and this is a cute place with a nice vibe. They don't know how to cook eggs and the waitress we had never bothered to come by and check on us she could tell I wasn't very happy but never inquired as to why. When we got up to the register the cashier asked how everything was and I told her the eggs were way over cooked and our waitress never bothered to check on us... That was a waste of words because she acted as though Ijust said nothing at all. 
The food was just so so and I wouldn't recommend going back. This was a waste of time and money poorly spent"}
{"text":"My first time here. It's Thursday morning and they are busy. Service was good and food was fast. Large portions of food and it was all tasty. Came in with my parents who were visiting. I will definitely be back with my family."}
{"text":"First visit at Biscuits Cafe for breakfast and greeted with a huge smile by Kathy, who was our server.  The Almond Crusted French Toast is one of their top sellers for good reason...definitely worth having!  Nice atmosphere with patio seating during nice weather."}
{"text":"Solid place... I need to try a few more dishes, but very good. I was looking for a new Bfast place as I was getting sick of the same two places I always go to. A Saturday breakfast is basically a family tradition at this point.

I have the Apple chicken sausages, crispy hash browns, biscuits and eggs. Sausage was genuine...real stuff. The hash-browns were crispy and still had some good potato content and of course the biscuits were awesome... See you there next Saturday..."}
{"text":"Average food for above average prices.  Three pancakes, 2 eggs and 2 pieces of bacon for $11.  The pancakes, biscuits and gravy are all average at best.  Wouldn't recommend with so many other options in the vicinity."}
{"text":"Service is incredible. Every time we come we get a free treat like cookies or strawberries to show they care. Smiling staff and great food make this place worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Food was amazingly delicious! The starter homemade cinnamon roll was to die for. I had to stop after 2 bites so I could eat my actual breakfast order. Will most definitely be going back. Staff were all really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Biscuits was recommended to me but my experience was not so great. The good: we had a very nice waitress who was prompt and helpful and the French toast was awesome! But the bacon which I asked for as \"crisp,\" was burned, and the eggs which I asked for as \"over medium\" were runny and I couldn't eat them. I did not want to make a fuss in front of our daughter but I did tell the waitress when she brought the bill that, \"this is not your fault\" and explained the problems."}
{"text":"Awesome! 3 visits, 3 different meals, all 3 I would gladly eat again!! Waffle was crispy on the outside & fluffy on the inside. Comes with meat & eggs, sausage links were good. Chicken fried chicken was delicious. Country Benedict was also delicious. Hash browns cooked just right. Even the coffee is awesome. 6 or 7 other menu items I'm dying to try. Place is friendly, well run, & clean. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I met a friend there yesterday for breakfast.   Perfect comfort food for a rainy day.  Our food was delicious and we had great service.  A bit pricey but you get ALOT of food.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Not worth your time,
The service is horrible. As far as wait time the staff forgot
Us and a 20 min wait turned into a 40 minute wait. The wait staff is incompetent . The bread on my sandwich was dry and stale. My wife's biscuits and gravy were stone cold. It was very obvious that a business that would put out a product like this not only does not at all care about customer satisfaction but take pride at all in what they are serving. Not at all worth your time or your hard earned money."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed after coming to this location. Our waitress, Gloria, was less than enthused to be serving us. She came to our table 2 times and even those times she seemed extremely annoyed. She came once to take our order and once to give us our food and our check (yep at the same time). She never asked how our food was, because if she did I would have told her how horrible it was. Everything tasted old. The hash browns were stale, eggs were cold, my bacon was burnt to a crisp. It was probably the worst food I've ever had. Gloria did not offer to refill our drinks once and we were there close to an hour. I was really looking forward to a nice breakfast out, but instead we literally could have burned $30 and it would have been comparable. I will never go back and I will tell everyone how horrible of service they will get if they go here."}
{"text":"I've already come to Biscuits about 20 times since they've opened, and I can say that they excel in everything I would hope for in a breakfast place: the food is great, the service strong, the atmosphere clean and inviting, and the wait not overwhelming.

All of the french toast options are amazing (especially the Almond crusted kind) and the omelettes are solid (although the chorizo is on the mild side if you're opting for that.)

I love this place and hope it has a long and successful future."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place. The sausage gravy is the best! I like the country omelette! I've gone here probably 15 times since it opened and never had a bad meal. My family enjoys their food as well. On the down side, their prices are a little steep and if you go on a weekend from 8ish-11ish the wait will be around 45 minutes. Avoid the wait by not going during these times. Weekdays are safe during these times. They have a members card, and I usually get a free drink, or $5 off, or some incentive for going regularly. Most of the staff is really good. Occasionally they get busy and aren't good with itemized orders...such as something on the side, or leaving a certain ingredient off. I am pretty lenient since I worked in the food industry and know that it's not always the waitress fault...possibly cooks, etc... It's worth checking out..try biscuits and gravy!"}
{"text":"Well, after meeting the owner I knew I was in the right place.   A good starter meal for me, Breakfast, is a very peculiar art form that is hard to get just right.  But with the French Toast, the Hash Browns, the Sausage Links and that perfect cup of coffee....let's just say I was mighty happy.  I definitely look forward to many visits here!"}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast here, ordered the biscuits and gravy with eggs, bacon and hash browns.  The bacon was good, hash browns tasted like they were cooked in rancid oil.  The biscuits were nothing special and the gravy was terrible.  It tasted like they added to much thyme.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"I've already gone to the Biscuits location in Chandler about 30 times since they've opened, and I was happy when I saw this new location in Tempe closer to my house. This location is a walk-up, counter system, which I actually really like. 

I can say that they excel in everything I would hope for in a breakfast place: the food is great and  the atmosphere clean and inviting.

All of the french toast options are amazing (especially the Almond crusted kind) and the omelettes are solid (although the chorizo is on the mild side if you're opting for that.)

I love this place and hope it has a long and successful future."}
{"text":"This was the slowest... My potatoes were old. Server had 10 tables. The injury to insult was that We waited 15 minutes to PAY!! I could have walked out. No one would have known they had a guy... New kept leaving to ask how to process pymnt??? Where is his trainer?? Where was a manager?? I asked to split check rt down the middle when he said he would be right back.. I yelled and said put it all on one I have waited 15 minutes!!!! I am a restaurant manager... Don't ever ever bitch about a ziosk on your table to me again!! 15 minutes of my life lost because of a poor prepared staff.. Just upsetting.. And a bad look on those of us who work to hard for this not to be our guest experience!!!!"}
{"text":"There should be a zero star option. This was the worst meal I have had in a long time! Service was mediocre (maybe the only reason to give one star) and we had to wait 35 minutes for our food. When the food finally arrived the sight on our plate was almost unexplainable. My eggs,  supposedly sunny side up, were raw seeping with a clear goo as if straight out of the shell. My wife's eggs were also raw as if straight out of the shell. My pancakes were so undercooked that I hope the grill was malfunctioning so Biscuits has a semblance of an excuse for destroying an easy and common breakfast dish. My wife's french toast was also still covered in raw egg batter leaving an undesired shine and soggy texture. In conclusion, the experience was horrific and pathetic especially because Biscuits is a breakfast/lunch establishment. It would have been nice to have a manager to speak to about the horrific experience, for the very least, he/she could ensure it would not happen to other guests, but there was not a manager on site at the time. For Biscuits sake, we hope the single bite we consumed does not make us sick."}
{"text":"My first time here. I of course had to try the biscuits & gravy. I have a very high standard of biscuits & gravy based on my Aunt from Iowa whose homemade biscuits & gravy are the best. How ever the food was good and the service was excellent! The restaurant & bathroom are clean and nice. I'll be back soon to try something else."}
{"text":"So yummy. Amazing. Delicious. Had a burger for dinner, can't wait to try breakfast. Joe was our server and our cook. The best. Will be back. Highly recommended. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Amazing food."}
{"text":"So today I tried their Alma location. The quality of the food I ordered was just as bad. I'll post the picture of what I have this morning .  FOOD WAS VEEY GREASY AND PANCAKE WAS JUST AS BAD.

Owner / manager of both location should check out the quality of the food that they serve. I think they fill your plate up with greasy patato to pacify their customers. Makes it look like they give you plenty of food. WE WANT QUALITY , not QUANTITY !"}
{"text":"So I tried this new location hoping that they may have a better cook, than  the one on Dobson.

I was here at a little after 7am. They open at 6:30. You would think that because you're early that you will get the freshest food in the menu, WRONG! 

I ordered their corn beef hash that came with potatoe, eggs and hash brown and pancakes.

I have to return the hash brown because it was swimming in oil. I have not seen an over med eggs 
bathe in cooking oil and so it the potatoes. The corn beef hash was dry. I will post a picture later. 
Pancake was not cook inside. Yikes ! 

The waitress was very pleasant, and she called the attention of the cook to take it easy on cooking oil.

But at the end of the day I don't think that the manager ( not sure if there is one on either location),
nor the owner cares about customer's food experience. 

I tried the Dobson location and now this location and I will not come back on both places. Not worth it. 

WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!"}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced for the quality.  A basic breakfast of pancakes and a breakfast sandwich somehow ended up costing $29 dollars? Their name lead me to believe that they have biscuit sandwiches, but they do not. Not to mention, I've driven by this place a few times and they make their employees flip signs on the sidewalk in 100 degree weather. I will not come back here or support any business that treats their employees like this."}
{"text":"The quality of the food, the taste of excellent. I just can not get them to serve me the red potatoes and bacon hot. This morning I specifically said they are always warm or cold I want them hot still served bacon warm potatoes warm to cold not hot I give up."}
{"text":"I was going there because of the Name BISCUITS and was ready for Great biscuits! That was not the case I ordered 2 Biscuits and grave 2 eggs and bacon 3 pieces and coffee Cost $14.21. The biscuits are not flaky I had to cut them with a knife the gray average. Bacon so hard it was eating beef jerky and I was one of 3 people in the restaurant and never saw the server till I got the bill so I did not have time to send it back. At check out I said the bacon was bad and he said let me get you a couple of pieces to go! That is not what I wanted more bad bacon. Not going back!"}
{"text":"This place is close to my place and it's convenient  when I'm craving for brunch over the weekends to come here and get eggs. Service is always super slow, but good is pretty good. My girlfriend asked for coke and literally took for ever to bring her drink."}
{"text":"My family hadn't been here before but was feeling like breakfast still in the early afternoon, so we found Biscuits Cafe on Yelp and decided to drop in. 

The service was friendly, prompt, and thorough, and the food was good. I wasn't a fan of all the seasoning on the red potatoes (even though I normally like spices and seasoning), but otherwise the food was good. Thick, fluffy pancakes, waffles, and omelets; fresh strawberries; jams made in-house...

The portions and prices were fair. We would go again."}
{"text":"Back for the Biscuits! Ordered the 2 BISCUITS & GRAVY Combo with a side of hashbrowns. Asked for the gravy on the side and for some jelly because I like my biscuits one savory & one sweet. 

Service was excellent once again, food came out quick, portion is generous. Only complaint is that the bacon was overcooked and dry but my focus was on the biscuits anyway. They were tall and had a nice light texture. Gravy was \"ok\" and probably \"great\" to some but I've grown up with homemade country-style peppered gravy and this wasn't it. I added s&p and it was good.

My fav part of the meal however was the biscuit with fresh raspberry jam/jelly/preserves (been meaning to look up the difference but this one was thinner with the seeds). A tasty finish to my brunch!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and it's fantastic. Please do not listen to the old, cheap people about the prices or the old people who think the wait staff are slaves.  I'm old and I loved it.  (lots of senior communities in Surprise)   Had the Avocado Benedict and husband had the Brisket of Beef Benedict.   Both were delicious with fresh ingredients.  I had tomatoes, asparagus and avocado slices and plenty of sauce.  The Beef Benedict was loaded with delicious smoky tasting beef.   The potatoes were delicious and enough to feed three people on each dish.  Since we didn't finish our drinks they gave us each one to take home in a take out cup/lid.  When the snowbirds come back you won't be able to get a table at this place."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding, the service is prompt and friendly, and the freezer jam is the perfect compliment to a biscuit and a hot cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Perfect! The good is actually quite tasty.. I had the California chicken burger with a side salad. I like the way they stuff their griddles chicken breast with avocado and their side salad is made with fresh greens. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch..  :-)"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and every time has been great. The portions are HUGE and everything is around $7-8. The jam they give you with the toast is delicious. I wish I could buy a jar of it! 
The food is always good, tastes fresh and is very filling. You won't ever leave hungry."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on my last visit and loved it! My friends decided to try it one day when the wait time was too long at another place. Now Biscuits is their favorite breakfast place and they go there all the time. I'll go back again next time I visit."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh, staff was pleasant. Think I found a new place to eat. I would recommend it. I was pleasantly surprised and always look to help other small business owners. Good lLuck"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful GF waffle. Best I've found in SE valley so far. It was delicious. Also discovered it's completely vegan which is a plus now for my GF & dairy free daughter. Will definitely be returning often."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here at 11am this morning....not able to. Waited 1 hour and 15 minutes and only got served our drinks. Told it would be yet another 10 or more minutes before we would be served. Manager offered to pick up the check if we stayed, but we we on our way somewhere else and couldn't wait any longer. Too bad food going past us looked like it was good. Might try going back at an earlier time. Until then, and until service improves, I can't give a great score."}
{"text":"Had been waiting for months for this place to open and I finally had the chance to try it out over the weekend. The menu was enormous, which is usually a turn off, but their choices were so delicious that I actually wanted to try out everything on that menu! 

I had the Almond Crust French Toasts and let me tell you, they were to die for! Yum! I loved everything about this place. Our server, Jocelyn, was wonderful, very friendly and attentive. They also have a Rewards program for discounts and free food! :) 

Honestly, I will be back many, many more times!"}
{"text":"Was just OK.   Had to ask someone to take our order.   My sausage was burnt,  the server didn't even notice I didn't eat my breakfast.   Handed us our check and walked away."}
{"text":"My son and I came here for breakfast. Our server, Marissa was very nice, helpful and accommodating. And the restaurant is adorable! I ordered the country omelet, which was just ok, nothing to come back for. But the biscuits and the jelly are AMAZING!  All in all I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Delicious! Biscuits is always a favorite, and I definitely recommend it. Today when we went in, we were seated in a matter of 3 minutes and had drinks on our table two minutes after that. We ordered our food and had that not even 10 minutes later. The potatoes were not crispy enough, but the waitress, Jen, brought us new potatoes 2 minutes later that were PERFECT. Jen gave great service and made sure to smile and talk with us, other than just to take our orders. There are no complaints, and all the food was superb. Next time I want breakfast, Biscuits will be my number one choice - and I will be asking for Jen!!"}
{"text":"Driving thru town looking for breakfast. We pulled into this shopping center hoping to find something. Well, we did! I ordered the biscuits & gravy, my boyfriend ordered pastrami & eggs that came with pancakes. These had to be the best tasting pancakes ever!! 
Our service was great and the food was amazing!! If we are ever in the area again, we will stop in for sure!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went here to have breakfast and it was the best breakfast i have had in awhile, the portion are huge, and the prices are reasonable! You should go grab some food from here. The service is awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Parking was easy... Greeted by 2 separate people at the front entry with a smile... Seated quickly and drinks ordered right after we sat down.  Kids said, \"look Dad real crayons!\"  Hot chocolate was like it should be... Full of chocolate and lots of whipped cream.  The waitress was responsive and informative for our first visit.  Food was delivered within 5 min of ordering.  Great size portions.  French Toast was light fluffy and had the perfect amount of cinnamon.  Meat lovers scramble was full of great size pieces of meat.  Kids enjoyed the chocolate chip pancakes.  Coffee was refreshed often and waters topped off.  The bill was priced right.  We will definitely be back.  A great alternative for locals who are sick of the regular chop shop breakfast joints.  My only disconnect was the name... Not sure if they have a famous biscuit or not.  It was never mentioned and I didn't see anything in the restaurant that stood out to make the connection with the name.  They do have a rewards program as well which can be signed up for online.  Give this place a shot and support local business."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there the other day. The place is clean service is good  the food is average"}
{"text":"I had an opportunity to stop into this Biscuits location in Surprise, AZ on 04/01/2017 and I will say that I was very surprised. The greetings and service was great as soon as I walked in. The portions were beyond my expectations they were very large. Overall, the food was great, but the service is what made the experience enjoyable. Definitely would recommend visiting this location."}
{"text":"When this opened across the street from my house, I was stoked. Finally a breakfast joint in my neighborhood! It was nice and clean, friendly and prompt service, and great food. The only thing I can say is that I was hoping for the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had, and they fell short a bit on the gravy. Even still, I've gone here a million times already, and will continue to..."}
{"text":"This is a great new breakfast place.  I am being generous with the five stars because they are new and have still managed to do a great job. Usually, new places have lots of hiccups to work out but this place seems to be dialed-in.  The staff was great.  Our server, Susie, was very sweet and attentive.  I had the Joe's Scramble.  The bacon chunks they mixed in made this an awesome dish.  I will definitely order it again.  This may sound funny, but the wheat toast was really good.  It tasted fresh and the jelly appeared to be made by the restaurant because it was not the usual pre-packaged stuff.  The coffee had a delicious robust flavor.

For my seven-year-old, we ordered the eggs, pancake and sausage patty.  He gobbled it all up.  I tried his pancakes - very fluffy and delicious.  The hot chocolate he ordered came with whipped cream and chocolate sauce drizzled on top.  He was so excited by how fancy it looked.

Their menu was really diverse but not complicated.  I had trouble ordering because they had at least 4 different items I wanted to try.  Again, even though they're new, it looks like they hired really nice people and that always makes things work out in the end.  I will be coming back soon, especially since it's 3 blocks away from me."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and on both occasions  I was pleased with my meal and the service. I love their very large coffee mugs. I had a chance to chat with the owner who was very personable and I had to ask her about their raspberry jam. She informed me that it is homemade...It is delicious too (gave them an extra star for the jam)! Of course since I have been making jam for over 40 years I already knew that! This is a fairly new establishment. Definitely give it a try!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time after all the other places we normally go had a wait list and this one didn't, now I know why! 

First off the restaurant temperature was pretty warm. I'm not sure if there was an A/C problem or they always keep it this temp but there were several tables fanning themselves and the little girl next to us complained the whole time she was hot & sweating. 

Our server was meh, kind of monotone and sluggish but I'm going to assume it was because it was so warm in the place she was as uncomfortable as us. 

My turkey sandwich tasted ok, but was so wet (I still can't figure out why) it was basically inedible and a soggy mess after less than 10 minutes on my plate. When my hubby cut into his omelet, the egg basically unfolded and all the meat rolled out. It looked like they had heated up pre-cubed meat in one pan, put it on top of some eggs, and then stuck a piece of American cheese on top. It was food, but not enjoyable. 

Then when we checked out, we had to wait in a line because they were busy trying to sign people up for their email club and we had to wait for the person to fill out their form. Have people do this a their table, not when we are trying to pay our bill."}
{"text":"Food came quickly. It is delicious. Service is great. Ham is a nice size.  Gravy isn't too thin like some are..only a breakfast and lunch location. Really clean and modern"}
{"text":"Saturday 10am. Full house, but seated immediately on patio. Shaded at 10 and misters. You are in the parking lot, but it was nice and quiet. Inside was loud. Very pleasant service. Spicy breakfast tacos with hash browns. Two filled open face corn tortillas. I liked how the first tortilla held the eggs while the outer one was crisped up on the grill. Very good. Salsa and sour cream. Salsa kinda out of bottle bland kind. French toast w/ links and eggs. Very good links, everything cooked perfect. First visit, will be back. $25 was worth it."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time recently and was not impressed. Ordering two plates for two people, an orange juice, and a coffee cost over $25, which was ridiculously overpriced for the amount of food we received and the quality of the food that was made. The \"belgian waffle\" wasn't anything impressive. Literally, go to any hotel and you can make it yourself in less than 3 minutes. Next time I'll stick with Ncounter or Essence Bakery if I want a quality breakfast for a good price and good amount of food and flavor. On a side note, the interior designing was nice, but that does not compensate for the disappointment in the food."}
{"text":"Amazing food and family feel when you are in. Great staff and management! Really reminds me of home cooked meals growing up. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place. The service is so friendly and excellent here and always consistently good. I love the Avocado Benedict. I don't know how they get the most perfectly ripe avocados. The red potatoes are delicious and their fresh homemade jam is excellent. I always order the biscuits so that I can get that little tub of jam."}
{"text":"Just OK. I had eggs, sausage links, toast, and a cinnamon roll with coffee. The eggs and sausage were bland. The strawberry jam with the toast was very good. The cinnamon roll was nice and soft, but had kind of a funny aftertaste. The coffee was OK. There were assorted flavors of coffee creamers at the table, not my thing as I prefer half and half, but good if you're into that. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful, but perhaps a bit over attentive. Can't say I'd go there as a destination, but I wouldn't object if someone suggested it."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The service was above and beyond. Thank you Melissa! The food was great! When we told Melissa we were from Alabama and the conversation started like we were old friends. When the conversation turned to biscuits and the difference between Arizona biscuits and gravy and Alabama biscuits and gravy, they ask us to do a critique of there version of B&G to what I was used to in Alabama. Knowing something about B&G, I agreed to the critique and here it is! The biscuits were moist and well browned on the top, which I like. I can't stand a pale biscuit. They weren't jumbo but they weren't croutons either. The biscuits were floating in a sea of thick and hot gravy! The gravy had a great taste with large flakes of pepper and something I just couldn't my finger on. The only thing missing was large pieces of crumbled sausage. Other than that I thought it was just as good as what I could get at home! I give it a big ROLL TIDE! Don't get me started on the butter biscuits and the jams that were out of this world!!!!!"}
{"text":"Another mediocre chain and pricey. 4$ for a large oj. Food took forever and came out after everyone who came after us. Benedict poached egg was broken, sausage overcooked. Funny taste from whatever they use for frying. Not again biscuits."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for breakfast. He ordered the french toast and I ordered a vegetarian omelet with red potatoes and fruit. The potatoes weren't cooked through and were ice cold, the omelet was overcooked but the veggies in the filling were inconsistently cooked (the tomatoes were old, and other veggies were raw) and the \"fresh fruit\" was past edible. The only good part was when the waiter was told, he took my meal off the bill. Lots of other great places to eat around- we won't go back."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey for honestly not the best food. Me and my friend split a plate and got two drinks ended up spending $30 including tip. A bit outrageous for splitting!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible. We waited a few minutes to be seated. Server walked right by us and ignored us. Finally got seated. Again we were ignored by the servers. After 5 minutes just got up and walked out. Can't comment on the food, did not get that far."}
{"text":"We discovered this place last weekend, and WOW it was awesome!!  The place is pretty huge for a breakfast place so there was virtually no wait during \"prime time\" on Sunday morning.  Prices were in line with other area breakfast places, but the portions were HUGE and everything was very fresh and much more homemade tasting vs our (former) regular place.  Service was excellent as well, we were very impressed with this place and we'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Institutional grade food  ,pancakes good , however hash browns and omelet couldn't eat . Lazy cook not making up fresh food."}
{"text":"Second time here and enjoyed my breakfast! You must try the biscuits, they're excellent!! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because of where I was sitting. This location has an indoor/outdoor area but it faces East with NO shade screens! Please invest in some high quality sun shades and people will enjoy having breakfast without getting roasted by the sun."}
{"text":"Ate once before at this restaurant and my Joe's special eggs were horrible but thought I would give this place another try. Received a coupon for joining Biscuits Cafe, one free drink and a Birthday coupon a few days later for $5 off a meal.  Well, they would not accept \"two\" coupons in one day! Why not?  I don't think this would break the bank, do you?  Proceeded to order their special, almond crusted French toast, fried bacon and 2 eggs.  The meal was okay.  However, we also ordered their NEW Taco salad.  

The meat looked burnt, not even sure what it was, the shell was greasy, overcooked and truly not eatable.  I kept looking for the beans, not to be found in the salad.  The salsa was delivered in a very tiny ketchup cup, about two tsp.full.  I asked for more.  A small dish was delivered that was better but very bland in taste.  I had a side coming of some kind of bread so I ordered a biscuit since they are known for this and gave it to the person eating eggs. The biscuit was small, tasteless and dry.  I could do a better job with Bisquick mix!  When I was about done eating the salad, I happened to look under the shell only to find my BEANS!  Who does that? 

The bathrooms had the toilet paper holder & paper towel dispenser, both hanging from the hinges.  No paper towels were in the holder or to be found. I saw an employee walking into the bathroom and then coming out of the bathroom within seconds, while adjusting his privates and getting back to work. Did he really wash his hands? Will not return to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  Service is fast, food has always been delicious.  Trust me you won't leave hungry.  I have tried different things each and every time I come here and have been very satisfied each time.  Ample parking is a plus!"}
{"text":"A real disappointment. Thought with the name biscuits in the name, the biscuits would be good. I was wrong, they were obviously not fresh or made on site. I recommend not ordering the biscuits."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the staff was amazing. Great little place to satisfy your hunger!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for a Sunday breakfast. Very close to where we live. Service was very friendly and the food was delicious. I had the corned beef hash and my wife had the 2 eggs your way with pancakes. Nice, modern decor and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really like this place. They have a wide variety of food here and the staff has always been friendly. Prices are very good, I'm not sure how some people spend so much they must be ordering special drinks or something. Anyways Good food and specials here. I like to get the omelette but everything I've seen looks pretty good, especially those cinnamon rolls sitting in front of you at the counter. I like how you order at the counter, saves time and money. I'm glad they moved in here after baja fresh bit the dust. I also like to eat on the patio but it is getting a little too hot out now."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in on Monday about  11am....our server was miserable and it showed.  I ordered biscuits and gravy with sausage patties. The sausage was like hockey pucks, and the biscuits were raw dough in the middle. ..and...VERY cold.  Sent it back to only receive the exact same thing.  I have been with my husband for  10 years, and he has never spoken out before,  but, he was livid.  We left and will  NEVER BE BACK . MEANWHILE THE MANAGER IS SITTING AT A TABLE TALKING AND IS OBLIVIOUS TO THE SHIT SHOW GOING ON RIGHT AROUND HIM."}
{"text":"Horrible Service!!!!! Our waitress Bobbi Jo was the WORST we have EVER had in all of our dining experiences. She seemed legitimately mad when we needed something and took forever to give us silver wear. The food came out and the hash browns were not cooked all the way, so we asked if they could cook them a little longer. They bought them back out and they were so over cooked that there's no way they didn't do it on purpose. Food was ok but based on the service we will NEVER return again. Shame on this place for the level of service they provide."}
{"text":"If you're wanting average eggs, above average pancakes (sweet potato specifically), and below average bacon & coffee - the Biscuits Cafe is you're place. There are lots of other spots in the PHX area far better for breakfast/brunch, but if you're in the area and need a quick place to meet this will suit you just fine."}
{"text":"Great service. Price is reasonable. The corn beef hash is delicious! If you love Jamms corn beef, you'll love this place!"}
{"text":"Ive been waiting and waiting for Biscuits to open.  With a name like this....you'd think they would have great biscuits.   And they did not disappoint.  Though small, they were light and airy and the berry jam they served alongside was divine!

I ordered the chicken fried chicken with eggs and red potatoes.  Nicely cooked with plenty of flavor.  The service was quite attentive...bordering on smothering, but totally understandable being it was opening week and everyone was on their very best behavior.   I look forward to trying  many other menu items.  I will be back."}
{"text":"My past 2 visits will keep me from ever coming here again. Went on a lunch break with my wife. After 40 minutes we told them we had to go. Made us pay for our one cup of coffee before leaving. I thought nothing of it at the time, but now I'm furious and I will not be back. That is 3 times I have left this restaurant after 40 minutes with an empty stomach and they could care less. Never again."}
{"text":"Way overpriced tiny portions service is very weird there."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken apple sausage breakfast. It came with hash browns, two fried eggs and biscuits. I specifically requested my eggs over medium, the white done and the yolk still runny. My breakfast came out lightening fast, the sausage was so cold it almost tasted frozen in the middle, and had no flavor. My eggs were not cooked as requested, the white was so runny I couldn't even attempt to salvage a portion of them. The biscuits were so cold and dry even the butter and delicious jam couldn't save them. I would never go to this restaurant again nor would I ever recommend it. Go down the street a ways and eat at Mike and Rhonda's The Place!"}
{"text":"Seeing that there is always lines on the weekends for a decent breakfast place, I am surprised more businesses don't fill that need. I was thrilled when Biscuits Café opened as a close by option for weekend breakfast. I really like the staff. The servers and hostess have always been welcoming and helpful. The only thing that needs improvement is the cooks. Even the servers got frustrated with them and said they kept making the same mistakes over and over again. Despite that, the food is good, they give lots of it, too much actually, and I like the ambience."}
{"text":"Was a first time visitor and will now become a regular!!!! The biscuits are fabulous!!! Had the eggs benedict and that too was amazing. They're coffee is delicious! Bold taste and not bitter."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in here for brunch and were sorely dissatisfied. I had some pancakes, bacon and eggs. While those were okay, I could have gotten the same thing for the same value at Denny's for $5 cheaper. However, my girlfriend's meal was another story.

She had the 1/2 sandwich, soup and salad combo. I'll start with the salad, because that was the best part. The salad was decent; I'm not sure how you can mess up a bowl of mixed greens. The avocado ranch was a nice touch as well. Neither of us are sure why they served saltines with the salad and oyster crackers with the soup, but sure, why not.

The soup was a \"Yankee Potroast\" soup. My girlfriend coined it as \"minestrone with one quarter-sized piece of meat\", and that it had obviously been microwaved. Not a huge deal, but I think we all prefer food from an establishment that isn't microwaved and serves meat when it's advertised in the name.

Finally, the 1/2 sandwich was a corned beef sandwich on ciabatta bread. The ciabatta bread was hard as a rock, probably old. When it was deemed inedible, I suggested that she just take the sandwich apart and eat the beef and greens. The beef was so wet that when my girlfriend carefully took the sandwich apart, it splattered onto her wallet. Ew. Altogether, her meal at $7.29 of microwaved soup, mediocre salad, and an unappetizing sandwich was not worth the price.

I'll note one more thing here. With my pancakes I had poached eggs, and thank goodness I did, because I saw one of the servers shoving scrambled eggs into a bucket. I'm not sure when these scrambled eggs were cooked; it was likely in the morning for easy access when someone ordered them to pull out of the bucket, heat up, and serve. However, I'm not sure why they can't just cook scrambled eggs to order. That makes no sense to me.

All in all, it was a disappointing experience. I'm hoping that this was just an anomalous branch in an otherwise reputable chain and that they can fix some of these problems."}
{"text":"We love this place..the service is always good, food is great, big portions. And wonderful return customer discounts"}
{"text":"We didn't even make it in more than 2 feet. The place smelled just awful! Like rancid grease mixed with overcooked bacon. We left. After reading the other reviews I'm glad we did. We were so disappointed."}
{"text":"The corned beef hash at this place is very good! Service was quick, food was very fresh. Fruit sides were fresh.
The coffee is bland, but biscuits are light and fluffy."}
{"text":"Wow, Biscuits I love you! Thank you for opening up in my neighborhood. I love to support non-corporate food establishments and to see \"mom & pop's\" do well. It's the American dream, right?

I have been here at least 10 times. Everything I've had tastes homemade. This is no greasy spoon kind of joint. 

There was once a corned beef eggs Benedict as a special and it was spectacular! I have asked for it since and they will happily make it for me. It is definitely homemade with large meaty chunks of corned beef. To die for!

The French toast is also very, very good and usually what I order. The difficult choice is which one to order. I think there is four options. I have had the almond crusted once and cinnamon roll version a few times. The almond crusted was really delicious, but I keep going back to the cinnamon roll version.  Imagine cinnamon rolls sliced, dipped in egg batter and cooked to perfection. I order the grilled ham with it. They cook it so it is browned on the edges, but still moist and not dried out. Just the way I like it. 

I have taken friends and family to my new favorite breakfast place and all have really enjoyed the food and great service. They are a very friendly staff. 

I stopped in for lunch once and had the turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. It wasn't bad, I was just underwhelmed. Their breakfasts just set the bar to a higher standard. I have heard that the burgers are great.  Maybe next time I'll try one."}
{"text":"Came in for a patty melt.  Seems pretty standard.  Asked that the onions can be all the way cooked, and my waiter sighed.  Ok.  25 minutes later with four other tables my food came.  The onions were not cooked and my Frys were greasy and not actually cooked.  The waiter maybe hadn't ever eaten in a restaurant and didn't know that one requires napkins, drink refills, etc.  To summarize, the food was awful and the service worse."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings. I love the food but the restaurant is ran by kids. You ask them a question and they look at you like a deer in headlights and unable to provide a solution. In the future if you have a large party please offer a solution for example: employee: I'm sorry and we appreciate you coming in we are very busy. I have a few options are you ok with splitting your party up or we have available outside seating. Only option we were left with was to leave. It's sad business owners don't appreciate the power and importance of customer service."}
{"text":"Great service!  We had a party of 14 for a Saturday morning that they accommodated us quickly!  I had called the day before but the reservation had not been logged anywhere but they still quickly got us seated.  There were a few errors but nothing too bad and they were quick to fix them.  Food was very good."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever! Had the Country Omlette, so delicious! Fresh mushrooms, green peppers, onions, and diced red potatoes.  Loaded with cubes of tender steak and thick bacon.  The best part was the topping with a thick country sausage gravy!
Also, it came with hash browns which were just okay and homemade strawberry jam.
Service was great with frequent visits to the table for topping of coffee and concerns regarding the food.  Also,  pricing is very reasonalbe for the amount of food and  restuarant is very roomy.
Definitely coming back here when we are in town again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I took a total gamble on this place and it paid off!!! He Loves biscuits and gravy, so I just did a random search of biscuitsandgravy in Vegas and found this place.  So I'm thinking if they named this place biscuit cafe they must have some good biscuits. And boy do they! From the entry service was Great! Every one was friendly. The manager even stopped by and chatted with us for a few and was very happy that we drove all the way from south point just to get a taste. And they did not disappoint. The food was so good and fresh. We got our food very fast and the place was Full. The biscuitsandgravy were awesome. Fresh homemade jam, eggs fluffy I can just go on and on. We already know what we're gonna order the next time we go! It's so worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Really great service which can be hard to find most times,  the food was fantastic,  I had the biscuits and gravy and it reminded me of the blue Ridge country where I grew up. My kids both had Belgian waffles and they said they were great,  I had some too and I would agree.   Location was easy to find,  parking was a little hard to find but that just meant it was popular and you can see that by walking in the door,  this will be our goto bfast place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, homemade biscuits. Overall breakfast average at best. Wait time is long for what you get."}
{"text":"First time very impressed. Very efficient, clean, healthy portions, priced right. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Awesome staff! Super clean! Delicious food! Biscuits Cafe is a definite must have! The almond crusted French toast is superb. We have a family of 6 so we had the opportunity to try different dishes and they were all delicious. Chicken & waffles, pancakes, steak and their 5 berry compote."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! I had the brisket sandwich, which was delicious. Jam is homemade and is out of this world. I had to buy some to take home. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Love love love the biscuits and crazy."}
{"text":"Ask the hostess to sit in a section away from the doorway.  She informed me they were closing the section.  But they continued seating customers in the section I requested.
Our waitress was busy and did a great job.
Food was ok.
 KKH"}
{"text":"Awesome Place.   French Toast is great. Biscuits are fluffy and taste great.  Super helpful and courteous staff."}
{"text":"My 1st visit to Biscuit on Bell, Surprise, Az. was a very good experience.  We met with old friends for breakfast and happy that they suggested \"Biscuit.\"  I ordered Joe's Sample that included very good flavors.  My husband ordered Biscuit & Gravy, eggs, potatoes that looked amazing.  Our friends had pancakes with the worths and the server was very attending and made our visit comfortable.  I would definitely recommend it to friends and I will be going back for more bisuits and gravy."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this restaurant.  It was very crowded, but we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.  The wait staff moves fast in that place.  The service was quick with water & coffee and very friendly.  It took 9 minutes for our food to arrive once we placed our order.  That was great service with how busy the restaurant was.  I gave it 3 stars because although the service was 5 stars, the food quality was not.  My potatoes were extremely salty and my omelet was bland.  The amount of food on the plate was enormous though!  My husband said he felt like he was on an episode of man vs. food!  I really wish all restaurants had servers like this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The biscuits are dry and have no flavor. The cubed potatoes are better tasting than the hash browns. The rest is good."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a Saturday breakfast and this place really hit the spot. The Saturday crowd wasn't too bad but was much like the normal Denny's and IHOP crowd. The restaurant was originally a coffee house so that's the vibe that we got.

The menu was actually pretty wide and I got the meat lover's scramble. It was really delicious, the service was right on and very warm and friendly. Prices are pretty decent also. Apparently this restaurant has a few other locations also. If you're hungry for some decent portions of breakfast I would definitely recommend Biscuits."}
{"text":"The food was not good. Had the corned beef hash and it was bland. I asked for over easy eggs and they were over cooked. The price for the food is over rated. You need to make a change In your kitchen or your doors will close in 6 months tops!?or maybe less..."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here for the first time at a Biscuits. It was very crowded so apparently it is a very popular cafe. We  had to wait 34 minutes to place our order and approx 20 minutes for our food to arrive. Two tables that were seated after us received their order before us. My husband was annoyed by the wait. I wasn't as we did not have a pressing time schedule. The fresh orange juice was good. I enjoyed my scrambled egg taco item though the hash browns I gave my husband were undercooked. My husband ordered over easy eggs that he says were undercooked. He said that the fry pan was not hot enough to cook the bottom of the eggs properly. My rating is 3 stars; my husband rates it 2 stars. The cafe serves big portion sizes of which I don't care about. The taste of the food is much more important to me."}
{"text":"\"The Biscuit Cafe\"  The Biscuits were a JOKE !! If i order the main dish that your restaurant is named after it needs to be on point ..... Complete Let Down !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent corned beef hash! The red potatoes and biscuit's are amazing. Service has always been top notch and food comes out very quick. This is our new go to breakfast place!"}
{"text":"We are finally here! After months of waiting while they remodeled the building and then turning away while Winter Visitors clogged the entry, we are here!

And it's a mixed bag.

The service is very good. Our server, Bobbi Jo, was delightful. The food is pretty good. I enjoyed my kielbasa and eggs and my husband had the Keeping It Simple with pancake, fruit, and eggs.

But the prices are ridiculous. There are very few options for less than nine dollars. Toast on the side was 2.59! My tea was 2.49! This is a turn off. Cost should be commensurate with time and expense. 

So we enjoyed our meal but likely will not prioritize returning."}
{"text":"Wow and wow!! Pleasant clean friendly staff and the omelets are amazing!!!  My friend got the Biscuits with homemade strawberry jam!!  The biscuits were fluffy"}
{"text":"Good coffee and rye toast, but my eggs were under cooked, sausage over cooked and the gravy was so salty I could not take more than one bite.  Even my waiter said he thought it was too salty, YET, even after complaining not only to the waiter but also to cashier there was absolutely no offer of credit.  Not good customer service.  As you can guess I will never be a customer at the Surprise location, let alone any other."}
{"text":"Worst. French. Toast. Ever.  Tasted like it was soaked in syrup rather than egg."}
{"text":"This place is great!  So glad I decided to eat there. I shop at Frys and remembered seeing the sign when my friend called and wanted to go for a quick bite to eat. I had the eggs over easy with red potatoes, bacon and rye toast! It was delicious!! My friend had the eggs Benedict and loved it! The coffee is very good. The restaurant is clean and nicely laid out. The waiter was polite, and helpful. The food arrived at our table within a few minutes. The price for our meal was very reasonable and the portions were more than adequate.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible food terrible service, owner is a rude old man with no communication or customer service skills. Food mediocre at best uneatable at worst, not worth the visit."}
{"text":"We had a VERY BAD experience at the Surprise location, but wanted to give them a second chance as it was near our friends home. What a shame they serve such dosh. the staff were nice but the place was hot and smelly. We left most of our food. After a visit before we contacted the owners and all I got was rude old man with an attitude. Stay away. Such a shame!"}
{"text":"Ate there 2 weeks ago, heading back today! Service was on point, the coffee was excellent and our cups were never left empty. Had the chicken fried steak and eggs with hash browns. Yummy!!! I tried my sister in laws almond crusted french toast, & I was immediately jealous that I didn't get that!!! Heading back this morning for some french toast. And, I don't normally even like french toast! It was just that good!!"}
{"text":"This was the best experience...loved the service and the food. By far one of the best breakfasts I've had in Vegas. Avocado Benedict is off the charts. The rest of my group enjoyed their food as well...BLT, club sandwich and eggs Benedict were all excellent!"}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast!

This is our second visit here and the food was good again and the service was great again as well.

Highly recommend, and ask for Brenda... Awesome server!"}
{"text":"We dropped in to this spot at 6:45 one weekday morning. As we drove in, it didn't look like it was open yet, as there were almost no cars anywhere nearby. However, the door said it opened at 6:30, so we walked in and were shown to a table by a pleasant young woman. Clearly we were the first or second folks in the door that morning.
As the morning sun shone in, it was clear that the floor had not been swept from the day before. There was SIGNIFICANT crumbage under every table, as well as crumbs on my chair that I somewhat dramatically swept away as we sat. Unfazed, the sweet young thing told us about the menu and specials and offered coffee, pronto. As we browsed the menu and awaited our coffee, I noted that several of the bottles of hot sauce and other condiments on the table were coated with dried dribbles. Ugh. 
Meanwhile, a group of 4-5 \"white-shirts\" were hanging around, in and out of the kitchen and finally seated at a table adjacent to us. After our food arrived and we had eaten, I approached a couple of the now-standing \"management\" and told them how great our food and service had been- it really was- but that the dirty floor and unkempt table made me uncomfortably suspicious about what might be happening back in the kitchen sanitation-wise. I said we need more places like this in Glendale and that I really wanted to see them make it. They turned, looked at the dirty floor and said thanks and turned away. 
I might have given this place another chance if they had taken the opportunity to offer us a free coffee on our next visit, or apologized or said we were short on help last night, we hope you'll try us again... something! 
First impressions mean a lot. A clean floor is absolutely basic restaurant business!"}
{"text":"Rolled in on Saturday about 9:30'ish. We were seated right away - with our drink orders being taken as soon as we sat down. 
We ordered the Avocado Benedict and Chorizo Omelet. Both delicious!
Jocelyn (sp?) was our server, and was very attentive and personable. 
We will definitely return. :)"}
{"text":"First time visit on recommendation from a friend - food had good enough to consider giving them a second chance, but service was terribly slow and the food came out lukewarm."}
{"text":"Don't bother.

My husband and I tried the new Tempe location yesterday.  We arrived about a half hour before closing and were the only customers.  While I get that the employees probably want to get out of work as quickly as I do when it's time to leave work, in a restaurant I expect to get the same experience near closing time as the person who came at opening time.

The iced tea containers were being emptied and if we had wanted to sit on the patio under the umbrellas -- forget it -- the umbrellas were taken down and by the time we got our food we had watched an employee run a cable through all of the tables and chairs and lock them up tight.

The food was just okay, and rather pricey I thought.  I can go to the diner down the street and get far more food for half the price.  My Hollandaise sauce was rather lumpy, and the red potatoes \"with great seasoning\" were nothing special."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. Nice location and urban feel. The food was pricey  and good,  but as we sat there we noticed something....2 tables around us were calling over manager for issues with food. Not like wrong order issues, bit more like something in their food or whatever. As I was eating my eggs, which tasted ok I looked down and one whole section was green. What the what??? 

The almond French toast was very good. The male servers all had poor posture and kinda....weird. My husbands burger was good. So, not sure how to rate."}
{"text":"Didn't write a review after first visit because the place had just opened. This is a high priced place for people who just want a lot of food. $31 before tip for eggs Benedict and a fried chicken sandwich with coffee, juice and soda is a bit much, especially when the food is nothing special. Service was good."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here with my boyfriend after a long European vaccation. We were very satisfied with this place from the service to the food. Our waitress, Carry was fabolous and gave us greats advice on the menue!  The entire staff super friendly and courteous.  I had an omlett, which was perfect. And my boyfriend was pleasantly surprised that he had zero complainys about his food (cannot recall what he ate). I would definitely recommend this place. We will surely be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now. So far I've only ate from the breakfast menu but I've found it to be very tasty. They were very busy every time I went but I never waited more than  20-30 minutes. The only negative I really have to mention is that the kitchen was a bit slow. However, with how busy they are I can understand. And it always gives me a reason to enjoy the company I'm with more so it's not a hard thing to get over."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Big portions. I'm coming back. Came after the Pat Tillman run. It was packed, but  the line moved fast. I ordered the chicken fried steak with Ted potatoes and pancakes. It came with a fresh chocolate covered strawberry. Everything was delicious. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"My first time in and thought that the food was good, service was pretty good and they were friendly.  I could have used a refill on my water towards the end and she never came back around but nothing to be upset about.  I did however use the restroom and mentioned to my husband for a decent looking place with good service and food that the bathroom was filthy and I will just leave it at that!  He mentioned that the men's bathroom was bad as well!"}
{"text":"We live in the area and have past this many times.  I had the meat scramble and it was one of the better breakfasts I've had out.   Great service. Friendly.  Attentive.  We will go again"}
{"text":"New family favorite.  Breakfast on Sundays is packed, but even so they still manage to provide prompt service and excellent food. Skillet breakfast is off the charts GOOD!"}
{"text":"I came here this morning for breakfast and I already got a bad vibe when I entered. The customer service was not very nice and they treated us Like garbage. The soups are not good. Very high in sodium and the chili is the worst chili I have ever had. The corn bread was not moist. The chobb salad was very good though. I do not recommend this place though."}
{"text":"This place has a nice casual atmosphere with good food.  The Huevos Rancheros are tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Great food! great service! Love this place & their biscuits! get the Veggie Benedict my favorite & join their rewards system!!! Great place to bring kids too!"}
{"text":"Best place for burger w egg....... BREAKFAST BURGER.....Yaaaaasssssssss queeeeeeeen! Get w side of syrup ........mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant approximately 20 times. Most of which when they first opened. Under the original management they were awesome. Coffee filled, food great, and timely. When management changed Biscuits tanked. The food and service suffered. A few days ago my wife said she had a coupon. I reluctantly decided to go again and see if things changed. Horrible is the best word I can give my experience!!! 3 meals- BLT with avocado, corned beef, biscuits and gravy w/ eggs and bacon. No avocado on sandwich, corned beef sopping wet soggy, biscuits plate was cold. Several coffee runners passed my table without asking if I wanted a refill. I returned my sandwich and had Monica our waitress remove my meal from the bill. Monica said she could get avocado for my sandwich. I declined. From that moment Monica's attitude became distant towards us. I told the cashier and I believe shift leader about our experience. They seemed shocked and reluctantly apologized. I have in the past voiced my distaste with the decline in service to no avail. Needless to say but I will, I will not be spending my money at Biscuits no matter how many coupons they send!!!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for great home-style breakfast, this is the place to go!  It's my new favorite breakfast hangout.  Try the chicken fried steak... It's off the hook!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, the servers wonderful. It gets very crowded on weekends, but the staff stays on top of things well. We always enjoy the food, and especially recommend the BLT, they serve very tasty bacon...Best new breakfast and lunch restaurant in our local area. A nice touch is their frequent diners' club: earn discounts on further meals by signing up (no card required, they take your phone number at the cash register). Very nice surprise to have an occasional ten dollars removed from the bill..just remember to tip the waiter on the whole amount...grins..."}
{"text":"One of our favorites! Friendly staff and delicious food. Try the chicken sausage and sweet potato pancakes."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this new breakfast place, but never got the chance to eat there.  We arrived on a busy Saturday morning, and joined the line to seated.  There were plenty of employees and places to sit,  but no one was acting as host/hostess.  We really should of cut our losses there, but we waited.  We finally were seated, and  for 10 minutes with no server, or anyone acknowledging us.  It was strange.   As we looked around only 1 table out of 10 or so had food.  We gave up and left.  I am not sure if the staff wasn't trained properly or there was no manager directing people. There was a bunch of staff but they weren't really helping anyone.  We really wanted to try this place out, but the lack of service made it not possible."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The pancakes are to die for and their sweetness level is perfect!!! Definitely recommend this place for a brunch with the ladies."}
{"text":"Eh...it's okay. Nothing to write home about and the service was very lackluster. Have never had to ask for water and coffee refills so often. Too many great breakfast places around to settle for this place. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I live around the corner and always went to the one on Dobson so I was really excited when this one opened. The staff is friendly, the food is great and the portions are huge. I recommend the chicken fried steak and the enormous cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great lunch Rueben sandwiches.
Flavorful lean meat and fresh marble rye bread.
The sevice was warm friendly and prompt from the hostess to our waitess.
We look forward to trying breakfast."}
{"text":"After our last 'ok' experience, we thought we'd give it one last chance. Big mistake. Not only is the service terrible (and slow), the food is awful. Pancakes? Disgusting. Waffles? Disgusting. Hash browns? Disgusting (and cold). Biscuits & gravy? Disgusting (which is weird, because the place is called Biscuits!). You get the picture. I'd much rather just make waffles at home from a box then eat this garbage again. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Best french toast I've had in a long time!!!!! Really nice ambiance,  open, clean, friendly people. We cane at 1pm Saturday and it wast busy. Quick service and the menu has a little bit of everything on it! Can't wait to come back next brunch!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Walked into the restaurant at 7:00 am to loud country music. That was rough. The interior resembled a hotel continental breakfast lobby (sterile, random picture of a horse). My expectations were high as this is a restaurant based in Oregon and great things originate in Oregon (Dutch Bros, Tillamook Cheese). Probably just needs to stay there. Food was not memorable, service was fair."}
{"text":"This Café is way over rated and over priced.  Gravy is terrible and the way the food is put on the plate is disgusting.  Will never go back, they do not hold a candle to HOOSIERS!!"}
{"text":"I was mildly surprise by this place because it is a chain restaurant but they do  very good and quality food. I tried it twice in about a month and look forward to going there again. First the service is pretty quick for pretty good quality food. Second, I like again that they open early, very convenient, people here tend to sleep in I guess so hard to find anyone open before 7:00 AM. 

I have to agree with one of the review, in that the biscuit and gravy is not their signature dish, but it is actually one of the best gravy if not tied for the best gravy I have tasted here in the phoenix area. It has rosemary I believe and some additional spices so it is not so bland  or just salty like almost every restaurant. It could use a little more kick to it, and you can provide that since they have like 4 different hot sauces on the table for you. The biscuit is okay, it could be a little heavier or denser, kind of too light  and airy almost like a roll instead of a real biscuit. It is well done and again, one of the best biscuit and gravy I had here in this area. 

The other dish I tried was the  corn beef hash. This was probably the second best corn beef hash I have had, the other one was at red bird cafe which is closed now, so I guess it is the best that I know of that you can get. I like my corn beef has to have large chunks of beef and spices and onions etc. The only things that I can nick pick about which I do a lot is that there could be a little more kick to it and there was not that many potatoes and the beef could be seared a little, give it a little more texture and a crunch. I know a lot of people like their corn beef all broken up or smashed up to where it is like baby food, but that is the way I like mine. Again the dish is not the best I have had, but it is up there and a big step ahead of most places. 

All in all, their food has quality ingredients and done very well to excellent. The down side it is a little tempered down, but by their clientele, I can see why(a lot of seniors). They are a little on the pricier side, but I look forward to trying other things on their menu."}
{"text":"The best breakfast and brunch location in Surprise! Vegan and vegetarian friendly and their sweet potato pancakes are to die for"}
{"text":"Poor service: Asked for a booth. 10-15 min, no prob. 20 mins later seats are open, but still waiting. I asked for first available and was told there's a problem in the kitchen. A heads up would have been appropriate!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, his sister and I came here to see what was this Biscuit Cafe place was all about for breakfast. Customer service was on top of there A game. Our server kept refilling our coffee mugs and made sure we were doing okay.  I ordered the New Smoked Brisket. I thought it was okay. My boyfriend ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken so I tried it and the chicken was juicy and the flavoring of the gravy was just right, not too salty.  I think I'm going to order that next time! His sister ordered the Corn Beef Hash w/ red potatoes. The corn beef was slow cooked, it might be dry to some people but I thought that one was delicious--according to my taste buds!  I'm definitely going here again!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding addition to the Surprise Community. Service was great! Food was great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place, since it was local to us. Bad decision...not sure if they were understaffed or just couldn't handle the amount of customers, but it took 40 minutes for our food to come to our table. I ordered corned beef hash with eggs over easy - the whites of the eggs were not cooked - the white part was still raw and runny. When I told our waitress, she asked what I would like her to do, did I want more eggs?? Seemed like an odd question - of course I wanted eggs that were cooked! Instead of taking my plate and bringing it back with cooked eggs, she just brought me two more eggs. The silverware that comes wrapped in the napkin contained a dirty spoon, but that's what I had to scoop the raw egg off my plate and replace with the cooked egg. Disgusting...When we went to pay our bill, the young man at the register asked us how everything was. We told him about the uncooked egg. His response was unsympathetic (similar to our waitress) - said \"that's too bad\". Really??? A restaurant that wants my business would have handled this entirely differently - maybe taken my plate and brought back a fresh one, maybe offered some compensation on the bill, maybe cared that it wasn't a quality dining experience...We won't be returning. Although the location is convenient, there are much better restaurants out there."}
{"text":"I travel for business and eat breakfast on the road quite often so I know what I like and don't like in a restaurant. Fortunately I live close to Biscuits Cafe and have had nothing but good experiences. Service is always good, food is always good (even if I don't care fore their gravy) and I am judging this off many visits for breakfast. Regardless of reviews, there is a reason they are always busy."}
{"text":"I had the 3 meat scramble on 10/31/17. 
The food sucked , nothing special about the eggs at all !!! I asked for well done hash browns , and they came out slimy. Asled for new ones , came back cooked nice , but half the portion. Very very over priced , over rated , and mediocre food at best !!!"}
{"text":"Best french toast ive ever had! Service was on point, and the coffee was great! I live atleast 10 miles from this place and go as often as i can. Bacon, and eggs were great as well."}
{"text":"Food was better on my most recent visit and place has gotten cleaner. I'll be returning again soon...................          

......."}
{"text":"I had the Bisquits Omlett w/rfried red potatoes, sub bread for fresh fruit:   Eggs taste like powdered eggs or maybe liquid; vegies and meat were chopped small ( i like to bite into what Im eating) cheese was 2 slices, one on top and one kinda in the middle;  the omlett had some good flavor. Fried potatoes were like eating rubber, again, chopped small with ok flavor;  could not eat the fresh fruit, it tasted like fish!"}
{"text":"Wonderful new café, biscuits as good as home made can get. and the service is GREAT.... and the coffee is wonderful. it's only for breakfast and lunch but gets crowded fast, even though it is a big restaurant. portions are big enough to share. Say Hi to art, he will be around to see if everything is A-OK. We love this place :)"}
{"text":"Great place to eat at for breakfast they give you a lot of food. Only thing is they close early."}
{"text":"I have been here twice recently and enjoyed both times. I had the avocado eggs Benedict and it is cooked very nicely... the service is good. I would definitely recommend breakfast from here. On a side note, the water glasses are huge which I love so even when they are busy you never run out of water. Nice little spot!!"}
{"text":"Awesome, fast, and friendly service. My husband and I tried it for the first time and we were impressed with everything, from service to the quality & quantity of the food.  Definitely recommend this to everyone! Might be a little pricey, but definitely getting what you pay for. We'll be back soon"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. Great breakfast and lunch choices. Big portions for reasonable price. I like their chicken avocado sandwich! Friendly hostesses too. Try it!"}
{"text":"My family and I had breakfast at this place for the first time today. I first noticed how clean and how nicely the place was decorated. We were promptly seated and greeted and were served our drinks all within a few short minutes. Our server was very pleasant. The food came out quickly, it was all very delicious. My most FAVORITE part of this visit was the coffee! YUM! It was some of the best coffee I have ever been served outside of a coffee shop. They even serve it in better than average coffee mugs! I highly recommend this place! We all left very satisfied!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter and grandson out to brunch because she likes it here. She ordered the stuffed meat omelette  and I just ordered a chicken avocado type sandwich.  The waitress was there asap and got our drink and food order.   Drinks came really quick but we waited 25mins for our food.  My daughter has only ever ordered the one menu item so she likes it... mine was  nothing fabulous.  Terribly over priced. I just had the same thing at Chili's on 77th and Bell and it was off the charts good--  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path but really worth trying.  Great service,  fresh food.  Even saw a celebrity having a breakfast there. My husband and I  didn't have the best food from other places so we were completely satisfied with everything.  

The only con was my chicken fried chicken,  that was actually just okay. Like a chicken rib patty, not a breast like I like but not the worse. The pancakes were the best I've ever eaten. They melted in your mouth. 

Overall great food and would definitely go again"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. I had a great meal here was hot and we'll made. The second time I came here I ordered the same meal but a completely different experience as the hash browns were way way under cooked the pancakes were hard and the eggs were super cold forgot my juice and never got my toast asked twice for it. I paid the bill and a 20% tip but only had 2 bites as it was the worst breakfast ever."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based off the decent yelp ratings and I must say I am surprised at all the hype. I knew as soon as we walked in it might have been a mistake. The greeter/cashier/beverage server? looked at us miserably and didn't even smile or say anything and just walked us over to our booth. She must have been around 17 or 18 years old and had an attitude as if someone was forcing her to work there or she completely hated it there. She looked really upset so I just decided to let it go since hopefully she had nothing to do with our service from there on. We were promptly greeted by our server who was a bit more friendly. He took our order and brought it but unfortunately our drinks and refills were left up to the hostess/cashier girl. She never came by to offer refills. When we did flag our waiter down for more drinks after leaving our empty glasses on the edge of the table for awhile, he passed the task on to her and she forgot and brought it towards the end of our meal and it was very frustrating. The waiter did nothing besides drop off our food and a check. The establishment was not particularly busy at this time. The food was NOTHING special. Maybe we came on an off day or the lunch menu is better, but based on the service alone, I have absolutely no desire to return EVER."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here for breakfast almost every weekend! Ate outside on their patio last Sunday. Love their biscuits and my wife gets spinach added to her eggs with no problem. I get the Southwest Delight Scramble w/o onions and sour cream every time and it's delicious! Their reward club gives us $5 off discounts all the time. Close enough to ride our bikes when we can.  The waitresses are very friendly."}
{"text":"Would like to take a moment to recognize the EXCEPTIONAL customer service Nicki, our waitress gave on 09/11/2016. From the moment we walked in, to the moment we left, our table had everything we needed. Nicki greeted us with a smile, talked to us regarding their rewards program they have. Our food was brought out on time. It shows that Biscuits's logo is well practiced. Nicki has what i call, the KNOWN attitude:

KIND GREETING
NOTICED OUR NEEDS
OWNED IT
WOWED US
NEXT STEPS

Thank u Nicki,

Gabriel Madrigal"}
{"text":"Went to lunch today at about 12:45.  Very poor experience!
When we walked in we waited about 5 minutes before anyone greeted us.  A server finally came out of the dining area to seat us.
It took an hour before we finally got our food.  Server said that our ticket was lost.  Other customers that came in after us had finished their meals and left before we got our food.
When we finally got our food it wasn't what we ordered.  One entree completely wrong and another one incomplete.
Very slow refills.
Had to wait on our check.
Cashier asked how our meal was and I said not very good.  He never said anything - no apologies - nothing!
Never saw a Manager or Owner during our visit.   Maybe that is part of the problem.
I left the server a tip only because I know that she  needs them to make a living.
Taking care of the customer is definitely not important here!  We always try to support small businesses but they have to at least try to take care of their customers.
We obviously will never be back.  There are many other good breakfast places in Vegas to spend your money on."}
{"text":"Went to Biscuits today after hearing how great it was..........will never return again. Starting off we got seated quickly and waitress took our drink order only to return with the wrong drinks. I ordered the cinnamon roll french toast since it sounded delightful, hubby ordered kielbasa scrambled eggs. When food was brought to the table it was only his and we were told we were waiting on mine.....10 minutes mine arrives and was barely warm, not sure what I was waiting on. Needless to say the cinnamon roll french toast was horrible also ordered over medium eggs which were hard. Waitress brought new eggs which were cold and runny and my toast had hair attached to it. The manager told us this never happens and asked that we come back and try again, highly doubtful. Upon reading other reviews obviously this happens all the time."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here! We were seated by a grumpy waitress, she seved our drinks by slamming them on the table... We had to wait longer for my breakfast because the cook didn't get my order right. The sausage came out when we were done eating and was dry and gross. ..my cinnamon roll came out with the to go boxes... couldn't get refills on drinks. .  Waitress forgot our check and was annoyed when we asked for it. The chicken fried steak is extremely small... and just a heads up a side of the dry cold sausage was $4.19...I will never return to this restaurant"}
{"text":"We had been anxiously awaiting the opening of Biscuits Cafe as there are very few breakfast/lunch places that are worth going to in this area. We were not disappointed! The space is roomy and inviting and the staff is friendly and knowledgable. We started with coffee, which was hot and very tasty.  The menu is extensive and covers all of the breakfast and lunch favorites anyone could ask for. The prices are moderate averaging around $10 per person for breakfast entrees but which may seem a bit expensive but once your food arrives, you will know why! My wife ordered the chorizo omelette which was awesome and huge, served with an equally huge portion of perfectly cooked hash browns and two very large, impeccably toasted sourdough slices. I ordered the biscuits and gravy which is accompanied by two eggs and your choice of bacon, sausage or ham. I ordered my eggs over medium and the bacon. The eggs were a bsolutely perfect and the bacon was thick and tasty. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my second time eating breakfast here.
The food is great. The only negative thing I can say is the food portion is huge, which is actually good. So prepare to have a doggy back on your way out. Or maybe it's just me. Because I see some big people that eat a lot!! Hahaha..
The Service is excellent... And the staff, very friendly and professional..I highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and not returning
Offering a Benedict means it should have real hollandaise sauce (not here) some alien looking slop over 1 instead of 2 eggs and not hot faux smkd brisket and soggy English muffins and the waitress is stocking the condiments while I'm eating the replacement meal that is also mediocre 
Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Love love love Biscuits!  Always good when we go and that's usually 1-2 times a week.  Chicken fried steak is delicious and so is the almond crusted French toast! Service is great,  people are friendly and never a long wait!  Would recommend biscuits to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time for brunch today. The woman who took our order was really nice. She could tell I was having a hard time making a decision and recommended the avocado eggs benedict. So I got it, even though I've never had that before and I love over-medium eggs. My partner got the chicken-fried steak. By the way, you order at the walk-up counter. 

We got our drinks and sat down. The food came out really fast! The pancakes for my partner were going to take a bit they said, which was no problem. About two minutes later, a man told us they had to make the batter for the pancakes so it was just going to be a bit longer and asked if we'd like some biscuits while we waited. We said sure, and he brought out two small, hot biscuits. THEY WERE DELICIOUS! And surprisingly really filling! He also brought some strawberry jam too. I don't even LIKE jam and I thought it was so good! And seriously 5 minutes later they brought out the pancakes. Not a big deal at all to wait at most 5-7 minutes for a side when your main meal is already out. But to bring some complimentary and delicious biscuits? EXCELLENT customer service and attentiveness all the way around. 

The chicken fried steak was really good and had some great flavor. The sauce especially had some nice seasoning to it. The hash browns were browned and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I personally would have liked them a bit more done, but it was no problem and really could be the difference of being cooked 30 more seconds. So, consider that my petty personal preference. Since I've never had eggs benedict before, I have nothing to gage my judgement against. So take what I'm about to say with a grain of salt: the first few bites were good. But after awhile, everything was a bit too soft and a bit too bland, even with salt and pepper. It makes sense; you have a smooth sauce, a poached egg (also my first one), a soft avocado, soft tomato slice, and an English muffin (evenly sliced and while warm, not toasted that I could tell.)  That's a lot of soft food with mellow flavors all at once. Not my favorite, but I could see how someone else would like it. Like I said, since it was my first one, I have nothing to compare. I ate about 1/2 of it, and since I had hash browns and that biscuit, you can see how I was full! Considering the chicken fried steak was delicious, I think it's just my preference that I didn't care for the eggs benedict. The only true compliant I'd have about it was that there was a bit too much hollandaise sauce. I would ask for half the amount. 

Overall we'd go back again, and try new things. They had some yummy sounding French toast and other solid breakfast staples."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes just to be acknowledged, manager took our order, food took another 30 minutes, food was ok, not very hot... Overall the experience wasn't very good..."}
{"text":"Really great spot to get some brunch! The staff is on point and so is the food.  Their Eggs Benedict is to die for.  I've been here numerous times, and feel like a move to this side of town is necessary just to be closer to the restaurant.  This place is medium in size, but offers patios seating which is enjoyable with lots of shade from the overhanging building. I recommend this place if you love breakfast and brunch!"}
{"text":"You know....I can't say our breakfast was bad....cause it was good.....can't say service was bad....cause it was good the morning we were there.....can't say it wasn't clean....cause it was....The only down side to us.....it's pricey....BUT.....the amount of food delivered on the plate is HUGE....You'll probably need a go box......that's the reason for the3 stars....I'd rather pay less for lesser quantity of food....Breakfast for the 2 of us was about 25 bucks...and we didn't have a beverage..."}
{"text":"This was not only terrible good not also came worth even worse service! Went with a friend that said \"they have the best burger\" in town. We shared our order. First indication was when I noticed others who had been seated and offered after us. About 30 minutes after we had ordered in a restaurant that was half empty out \"burger\" showed up Luke warm, wilted lettuce, tomato slice with center core stI'll in, fires not even warm, the pickle which looked like it should have been great was limp and warm lastly we had asked for some thousand island dressing to dip the fries in. It had a film on top from sitting out too long. I made an attempt to eat but this was the worst good and service I have had in the 28 years of living in Las Vegas. All this for just under $18.00. Believe it or not Ieft a 20% tip...my bad. Plenty of great food in Las Vegas. Just not at the Biscuit Cafe. Never complained before. No redeeming qualities."}
{"text":"We decided to try something new. It's a big space which doesn't feel cramped like many restaurants do. We ordered the eggs Benedict avocado and biscuits and gravy. The Benny was good, but not outstanding. The biscuits weren't as \"homemade and fluffy\" as we hoped but the gravy was great. Coffee was good quality which some restaurants struggle with. Quick, friendly service. Breakfast for 2 was $24. I'm not sure we'd choose to come back, but if someone wanted to meet us here we wouldn't protest."}
{"text":"First time here. Will be back next time I'm in The Valley.  Had the Smoked Brisket Benedict - excellent.  Stacey had the Corned Beef Hash - GR8.
Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Listen, Biscuits - I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.

This isn't my first rodeo. I know you're slammed on Sunday mornings. I know there's going to be a line out the door. That line is almost a promise to me that says \"this must be worth waiting for.\" 

BUT, if you're going to make me wait for 40 minutes for my food (which I'm completely willing to do, by the way) please, please, PRETTY PLEASE:

Don't serve me French toast that is burnt black on one side, and try to hide it by putting the burnt side down on the plate. I even tried to eat a corner, to see if it was edible, because I knew how busy the kitchen was, and I hate sending food back - but it wasn't happening.

Don't offer me a two-inch-thick heap of hash browns if you can't send them out fully cooked - or, wait for it - browned. I'd happily take a normal serving of hash browns if you could promise me they would be crispy on the outside, and fully cooked in the middle. You know, like hash browns. 

Don't seat me in plain view of the kitchen and expo window unless your cooks are on their best behavior. I watched them bare-hand grabbing stacks of pancakes in the expo window and moving them from plate to plate OVER and OVER again. They did it so casually that it leads me to believe that it's just a standard, everyday occurrence in Biscuitville. Touching ready-to-eat food with bare hands is not only completely disgusting, but it's a health code violation; and it's completely unnecessary. I know you've got gloves back there, just put them on. 

Don't seat me at a table without actually, attentively, and thoroughly cleaning all of the gak off of it first. Listen, I like guessing games as much as the next guy, but at a restaurant, I never want to play \"Guess the Mystery Breakfast Sludge on the Edge of The Table.\" Not my favorite.

Don't let the guy in the neon green Nike polo wander aimlessly around the restaurant in the middle of the breakfast rush doing next to nothing anymore. I'm guessing he's supposed to be some kind of manager or supervisor, but he's really just in the way. I sat in the restaurant for nearly an hour, and watched him roam the grounds at a snail's pace, with a look on his face that fell somewhere in between total apathy and complete shell-shock. He bussed a handful of tables, kind of wiped a few, but mostly he just siphoned precious oxygen from his very hard-working, very \"in-the-weeds\" wait staff. If he's not actually a manager or supervisor, who is he? Why is he wearing an obnoxiously loud polo? How has he mastered the art of sleep-working, and why are you letting him do it in your restaurant?

Speaking of the wait staff, that brings me to the positive portion of the meal:

Linda, my server, gracefully salvaged my breakfast by never letting my coffee cup run low, reacting quickly and professionally to my request for un-burnt French toast, and by generally doing the best she could to make the visit tolerable. Good job, Linda.

The biscuits, as should only be expected of a restaurant called Biscuits, were phenomenal as always - fluffy, pillowy, breakfast heaven, smothered in gravy that was both flavorful and appropriate in viscosity. 

My second, un-burnt offering of French toast was delicious, and so were the eggs and sausage patties on my plate. 

Listen Biscuits, I like you. I want to love you. We really click on a physical level; you've got the flavor I need. But I feel like your heart isn't in it. I guess what I'm saying is, maybe we need some time apart. I'm going to see other breakfast places for awhile, and maybe, just maybe - when you find your passion again, we can be together. It's not \"goodbye,\" it's \"see you later,\" okay?"}
{"text":"What a find! We are in town visiting family and needed a quick stop for some lunch. We found Biscuits Cafe right off the 202. Service was amazing. My mom has an allergy to onions and the server was very vigilant about making sure there weren't any at our table. Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. The portions were generous and well worth the price. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab brunch if you're not an early riser. The prices are a bit high, but hey, if you want breakfast during lunch hours then that's the price I guess. The place was cozy and spacious with friendly service. 

This was my first visit to Arizona, and the French toast with berries instantly made my day. It was divine! The berries were fresh, and the French toast was soft and sweet. The syrup was just the right amount of sweetness as it is not stark raving sweet. The portion was fairly large so don't worry about them skimping out. My friend's plate was humungous. It seemed like the food was going to fall off his plate. Lol. He's a guy, and if he says it's a lot of food for him, then it's a lot of food.

I would totally recommend this place to anyone wanting a delicious brunch meal with a cozy place to sit and talk."}
{"text":"Well we tried to eat here today for Father's Day. We walked in and almost fainted from the stifling steamy hot atmosphere. I mean I know it's going to be 117 today but this was like a sweat lodge and I only weigh 107 lbs ! Then we were taken to the tiniest table I've ever seen in a restaurant and my husband is 6'3 and 230 lbs. at that point we decided to leave. Maybe will try again in the fall."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast here today.   Was very disappointed in the quality of the food.  The red potatoes were burned and tasteless.  They were served with a veggie wrap in a flour tortilla that was gummy and mushy.  Hubby had sausage with eggs and biscuits and gravy.  They were served with hash whites instead of hash browns.   He did eat most of his except for the hash.  Coffee is very weak.  Basically we will not be returning.   The redeeming factor of the visit was the waitress and the young man who seated us.  They were both very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Love the food here, have come for breakfast twice now - service is fast n friendly, cafe mocha is sooo good and includes refills!  Agreed, it is better than just going to IHOP or Denny's :). Our server yesterday was Brock, very attentive while we were there...AND, we all had leftovers - just as good the next day!!"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!! Incredible service & even better food. The almond crusted french toast might change your life. They even had flavored coffee creamer which I also loved. Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Finally found our new go to breakfast place!  Delicious food and great service.  Nice variety for both healthy and indulgent.  I would definitely recommend the cinnamon roll french toast!"}
{"text":"Tried biscuits cafe for the first time and I loved it! The food and the service were excellent!"}
{"text":"Good food, really, really, really bad service.  So slow at being served we saw server offering free meals to other people who were fed up with  waiting.  We paid for ours as we did not complain but will not go back again.  The server also did not come back and check on us at all, not even for refills. It was busy, but they should have been prepared."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Ordered the chicken fried steak and it was really good. Slightly disappointed in the sausage gravy as there is barely any sausages in the gravy and biscuit my husband ordered. A little pricy, but still a good place to go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had in a long time. The owners are incredible people. The French toast is unbelievable!"}
{"text":"I haven't heard very good things about this place but when i went on my own my impressions changed! Great menu items and the food was great!"}
{"text":"Food was cold. Biscuits were dry and gravy was salty and weirdly seasoned. Will never try again. Left feeling like it was waste of money and ruined our Sunday brunch tradition."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to a Biscuits restaurant. It will definitely not be our last. The food was great, pumpkin pancakes, chicken fried chicken...delicious. On one of the hardest days of our lives, our server Meagan, made us feel welcome and offered her condolences. Friendly and very helpful. Thank you Meagan. You helped our family through a very tough time."}
{"text":"The service here was excellent! The bus boys were refreshingly personable, friendly and helpful. Food is always good too.
Sara S."}
{"text":"The Biscuits Cafe on Warner and Dobson was fantastic!  This one was good...but may have a new cook?  Grill may have been too hot, so the red potatoes were a little raw.  They did rebook them without a fuss...just a little disappointed after visiting the other one.  Customer service was very good and would maybe return to give it another shot."}
{"text":"The food is good, but they charge $.70 extra to add cheese to anything. Ridiculous! The nickel and diming people over a sprinkle of cheese is outrageous... Could deter me from coming back at this point when I can go somewhere else for the same price and not get charges for small extras."}
{"text":"I met a friend and her dsughter here for breakfast at their request.  They ate open for breakfast and lunch according to their sign.  The service was great and they were very attentive to out needs.  They are a typical Americana Cafe.  I ordered the Belgium Waffle with fresh Strawberries on it, 2 eggs and sausage on the side.  I originally wanted the 5 berry topping but the waitress explained it was frozen and not fresh, praises for her honesty.  The sausage patties were dry and not really worth the effort to eat.  My guest really enjoyed their meals.  Over all experience was satisfactory.  The best part, aginan was the wait staff.  I rated as high as I did because of the staff."}
{"text":"I've lived on this side of town for ten years and finally made it to Biscuits Cafe. I'd heard really great things about it and was excited to try it out. When we first walked in I noticed that the lights are somewhat fluorescent and that there weren't any cute, comfy looking spots to sit; all the seats were tables and I'm a booth kinda gal. Our table was sticky, so we had to ask our server to wipe it down again. The service overall was good and the food came out pretty quickly. I ordered an a la cart meal with hash browns, biscuits, and fruit while my friend ordered waffles. The food quality was okay but I wouldn't say it was amazingly better than anywhere else. May or may not go back?"}
{"text":"Phenomenal! The brisket eggs Benedict is the best breakfast meal I've ever had! Great service and friendly staff"}
{"text":"We got the chicken fried chicken & that was delicious along with their gravy, red potatoes were nicely seasoned!!! We also got the 5 mix waffle combo with turkey bacon & boy is the jam good!!! Server was very sweet & let me try the gravy before we ordered, Great Place!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is packed. I love their breakfast menu. ..large portions and affordable price. Really good deal."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast yesterday,  I  will never go back! We were seated at a 2 top right in the walkway, we moved to the one next to the wall. We waited and waited, the manager,  who was on his 3rd day, came by and asked if anyone had been by yet, we said no. After quite a while longer, a waitress came by and took our drink order, I got iced tea, he got sour orange juice for $4.19, and from that high point it was all downhill! We both ordered ham and cheese omelets. The omelets had tiny cubes of ham inside and a slice of american cheese melted on. Top! The red potatoes,  I  got mine well done, so they were deep fried and no seasoning like my dining partner, I only ate a few! The pancakes were large and thick but the biscuits looked like dinner rolls and the top and bottom were VERY hard! Wait and wait for a drink refill until it was time to leave. The check was brought to me soaking wet in the server's dripping wet hands.
 The table next to me asked for medium well eggs, the egg whites were still runny!!
 This is not an experience I am willing to risk repeating!  The $10.99 for 2 eggs, 2 pcs of. Bacon, potatoes and 2 biscuits was over priced for the quality! ! I will go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and find another place to eat. This place is awful! Our experience started out bad and got worse-I should have paid more attention to the previous reviews. 

My wife and I went there on a Sunday morning and were greeted with \"2?\" at the door, not \"good morning\", \"welcome\"...nothing. That would have required some interest from the two geniuses at the entry. 

After being seated at a table, which had crumbs all over the seats and table, we knew this was not going to go well. We sat for nearly 10 minutes, all the time watching the completely disinterested staff chat with each other....we left. 

The best thing that could happen to this place is fire the staff and start over. If that doesn't work..close."}
{"text":"First visit since moving to this side of town. Hard working staff besides one of the front hostess girls who seemed to be a little out of it. Thinking she had a long night. :) great food!! I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Saw that this location recently opened, so went to check it out this weekend, and so glad we did.  The place looks and feels like a somewhat retro diner but its all new, modern and clean.  You order at the counter, and seat yourself, and you get your own drinks.  I liked this because you end up getting your food faster. The prices were normal, but they do have good lunch specials with soup, salad & half a sandwich for around 8 bucks or so. 

Each item we had, from the hash browns, to the eggs, to the chicken fried steak & even the pancakes were all really good, hearty, and tasted fresh. Large generous portions, and our plates came with a big ol' chocolate covered strawberry. Bring your appetite and definitely try the cinnamon bun!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and food is fantastic.  The preparation of food is consistent and they have the best hash browns in Summerlin."}
{"text":"If I could just rate this place for our waitress, I would give her 5 stars. Extremely friendly and took care of us very well. 

Unfortunately, the food was just not very good. I ended up ordering smoked brisket eggs benedict - on the recommendation of the waitress. I asked her which would be more flavorful out of the smoked pork and brisket, and she told me to get brisket. Well, the brisket was really dry, and had no taste. 

Overall the atmosphere and the staff were great, but the food was lacking."}
{"text":"Our first time here for lunch. I had the California club with salad and my husband had the club with yankee pot roast soup. Both were delicious"}
{"text":"Totally love this place!! Enormous menu, which is usually a turn off, but everything looked so delicious that I actually wanted to order it all! 

Staff was friendly and attentive, our server Jocelyn was great! :) Our food came out very fast and it was so yummy! 

I had the Almond Crusted French Toasts!! OMG!!! So good!!! 

I will be back many, many more times! :)"}
{"text":"Our first time but not our last. The biscuits are fantastic and so was the gravy. We also had the cinnamon roll French toast which was great. The place is small but the service was big."}
{"text":"the staff was very polite and good service. 
It he food however was terrible. I ordered chicken and waffles. The chicken was too hard to put a fork in. They politely cooked more. But 2 of 4 were not edible. 
My wife had fish and chips. It was only ok."}
{"text":"We came here rather than going to the Biscuits on Elliot. We had a time constraint but was there in plenty of time. The host told us it would be a 15 minute wait. We waited and all the people that were there before us were gone, and we were next on the list for 5 people.  Then they took a party of eight that came after us, then a party of 4 that came after us and multiple more. My wife went and asked and was told they were waiting on a table. We watched a couple more go in front of us. We finally had to leave due to our other arrangement.  Can't review the food, never got in.  We will not be returning to this location.  I would rather drive to Elliot."}
{"text":"We recently moved to this part of town and decided upon first seeing the moniker that we were absolutely going to eat at this restaurant! 

We ordered an all egg whites veggie omelette und eine Belgian waffle. We both had coffee. Overall, I really like the place. I was happy that they put cream cheese inside of the omelette because it made it taste so good!

The coffee mugs were gigantic and it was so good because I really wanted to guzzle some coffee today :-) it wasn't that busy, and I think that's why our waitress kept checking back.

My only complaint is that I really really like visiting places of business with a multicultural staff. This place might be new and they might just be working with the first staff they could find, so I hope to come back and see many different types of employees to represent the many different types of clients in this world :-)"}
{"text":"First time here. Was highly recommended. Had the Clam Chowder which was very thick & creamy. Just the way I like it. Came with a side of cornbread which was nice & moist. Then I had the Country Benedict. If you can't decide between getting Eggs Benedict & Bisquits & sausage gravy then this is the dish for you. It was delicious. Service was also superb. The whole staff was very attentive & making sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here as my car was being serviced next door. I wanted to like this restaurant considering it is locally owned. Our server was prompt and courteous, and the food was bland. Unfortunately it was a disappointment, from being ignored when we waited to be seated to the extremely soiled floors. When we went to pay, the cashier had a difficult time processing a card transaction. I understand these things happen but rather than asking for help she continued to struggle for a very long time without acknowledging anyone in line. Just not a good experience whatsoever."}
{"text":"First time here, had to try after reading Yelp reviews.  Saf(er) part of LV.  Went on Saturday at 830 am was way not busy, was surprised, but good time to go, not busy!!
Ordered biscuit and gravy breakfast including eggs and hash browns was great, will order again. 
Good service, coffee cup never empty, Yasmin was great!!

According to Jackie and Madeline it was very slow for a Sat morn. FYI.  5 star super friendly staff."}
{"text":"So just moved to Las Vegas and had my 1st breakfast at Biscuit Cafe. What a great choice. The place is very simple and clean. Wait staff from walking in the door to leaving was very warm and friendly. Now to the food my
husband ordered the corn beef hash and eggs with biscuits.  The hash was home made and plentiful he said it was the best hash he ever had. The biscuits were fluffy light and delish the homemade strawberry jam on the side was a nice touch and a sweet treat. I had something called Keep it Simple which consists of picking 3 items for
$8.99.  Choices were plentiful I went with
2 eggs, sausage links(2)  and a sweet potato pancake. The links were nice and plump and had a great flavor. The pancake was huge and truly cake like-yum! I thought they accidentally gave me 2 but it was only 1.  Upon leaving I signed up for their rewards program. For every dollar you spend you get a point and with food  this good we'll definitely be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Chandler!! Hands down, this place has the BEST pancakes. I took my kids here a few days ago and everyone loved it - pancakes, omelet, and French toast. Service was very friendly. They have a nice patio that will be great in the fall. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was still open. They made the Best Pot Roast Soup. it was hot and had alot of meat in it. They also had a great club sandwich. Will miss them alot"}
{"text":"Nice place, great menu with lots of choices. The biscuits and gravy were great combined with a side order of sausage. The cinnamon roll french toast was great as well. The service was friendly and fast. Love this place we need a location in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am really not a big breakfast person.  When I do eat breakfast, I like to get a belgian waffle and its amazing how many restaurants can't get it right.  Well, at Biscuits Cafe, they do get it right.  You can either get a plain belgian waffle, one with fruit and whip cream, or you can get a combo, a waffle, eggs and some sort of meat-bacon or sausage.

I also like that the restaurant is clean-very clean.   Waiters, waitress, waitpersons? whatever-they have all been pretty friendly as well."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and such fast service! My husband and I tried it for the first time last weekend and we will definitely be back! Excited to try more food! The corned beef hash was great!"}
{"text":"This was my first and last visit.  Ordered Florentine Benedict with hash browns and sausage.  The eggs were overcooked not poached.  The muffin did not seem toasted, was mushy. The sauce was tasteless and so were the hash browns. The sausage was a tiny portion, smaller than a hockey puck and if the hockey puck had any taste, it would have been better than this dried out salty piece of meat. No adjustment was made on the bill to make things right."}
{"text":"I had heard pretty good reviews about this restaurant so, one day my mother and I decided to try it out. 
We ordered the biscuits and gravy to share and I had two eggs over medium well that we're cooked perfect, bacon, which was kinda too greasy but tasty. My mother had two eggs over medium, which the egg white weren't cook all the way and ham, which she said was good. We both had coffee, which was good and two glasses of water. 
Now, the only real compliant about this place was the water. The water tasted like they had gotten it right out of a pond! It was the worst tasting water I have ever had!! If they just cleaned to up and used a water filtration system or purified water system, it wouldn't be half bad. 
Are waitress was very nice and commentating but, I drink a lot of water so, I don't think I'll be back. 
Food was pretty decent though!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! We looked up places to eat and this came up and we are very glad we went! My boyfriend got the Ham Scramble which was awesome and I got the Cinnamon French Toast combo and it was great! The service was great, the restaurant was also kept very clean, and everyone seemed to have a smile on their face and looked like they enjoyed working there! I would defiantly try it, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our server Melissa was amazing. She was attentive and gave good suggestions on what to eat. The food was...mediocre and kind of flavorless. We heard some good things about this restaurant so decided to give it a try for brunch. We were disappointed to say the least. It wasn't gross, it wasn't good, it was just...meh."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new place out for breakfast. I remembered this place so I decided to check it out. I have to say I looked over the reviews before hand, of course, and was a little jaded by some of the bad reviews.
I arrived and was greeted and seated right away. It looked like a very nice place. Small but not tiny and pretty busy. I saw on the chalkboard in front that the Blueberry Pancake Combo was featured today. I thought it was a special but saw it on the menu and realized it was just featured. So server came over and was very nice. Took the drink order. Those came back pretty quick. Then placed the food order. He was very helpful even with a very particular special order.
Food came out in a timely manner and piping hot. Pancakes were a good size and very good. Blueberries were fresh. Bacon was nice and thick and just right. Eggs were done just the way I had asked. Everything was very good. Even tried one of their biscuits. How can you not when that is the name of the place and they were really good too.
Pancakes really filled me up could not finish. Stuffed in a good way. Overall, I thought the food was great, service was good and fast, the prices weren't bad and the place was nice and clean. I don't understand the bad reviews unless they came on a bad day or not everyone can be pleased. Don't know but I will be back to try out some of the other stuff on the menu that looked good. It was nice to find a new place for breakfast especially after some old favorites have gone down hill recently."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for the first time the other weekend due to a suggestion from my in-laws. Walking in, I knew it was going to be a great place because its straightforward and all about the food. The servers were very friendly and they remembered my in-laws who had only been there once the week before. That is always a good sign.

The menu offers variety at good prices. I ordered the coffee and thought that it was very good coffee compared to other breakfast joints in the area. I ordered the breakfast tacos with corn tortillas and they were really good and filling! I couldn't even eat the last taco and I normally finish my plate! My husband ordered a veggie breakfast burrito and when they delivered the food it looked so tasty and filling, but the veggies made it so watery and was near impossible for my husband to eat it! I tried my sister-in-laws veggie omelet and it tasted as if they cooked the veggies better in hers because the veggies did not water down the eggs. I thought the veggie omelet was very good in comparison to other Las Vegas breakfast restaurants and will probably order that next time. I also saw tables next to us order the biscuits which were huge, fluffy, and steamy. I cannot wait to try one next time and update my review!"}
{"text":"This is got to be the worst place to eat.. I order a cup of soup. It arrived cold..  Than I order cinnamon french toast with eggs it all arrived very cold they did not have our place settings no silverware napkins on the table we had to wait 10 minutes for napkins and silverware then I went to the restroom one of the employees came out still wearing the glove I was not sure if he was a busboy or one of the cooks as I proceeded to eat my cold french toast I found a hair on my plate..   The service was super slow."}
{"text":"I love this place; it's my favorite breakfast place on the north side. Service speeds can fluctuate based on how busy they are, but that's what you get with a good restaurant. A breakfast will run you from about 9-12 dollars which is average, but the amount you get is more than anywhere else I've been. The reviews on here seem pretty mixed, so I'd say you have to try it for yourself, but it may very well end up being the best place you'll find."}
{"text":"It' s a crap shoot, depends upon the cook.  The Staff is eager to please, down to earth, and you'll feel welcome.  But, depending upon the wind direction, and day, you will notice a difference in the food that, well, lands on your plate.  Vegas, Baby!"}
{"text":"After a few months, we came back because we were in the area. The food here is pretty good, but the service could be better. Our food was slow to come out, because they were busy, so I guess that is a good thing. After waiting a few minutes with an empty coffee cup, I had no choice but to go get myself more coffee. No one was there of course, so I went into the coffee room and poured it myself. I told our waitress I did that, and she was very attentive afterwards. Too little - too late. Mediocre food and bad service is why Biscuits went from 5 to 3 stars in my book."}
{"text":"Went here for a late breakfast today. The food was tasty and the portions were large. I had bacon and eggs with pancakes. I couldn't eat the 3 pancakes, they were delicious but big and there were 6 pieces of perfectly cooked bacon. My son had the cinnamon roll French toast with scrambled eggs and bacon. He is a 6ft 3inch young man and couldn't eat it all. Again 6 pieces of bacon and the French toast piece was huge. He was pleasantly stuffed!  I recommend it!  The service was good too, very pleasant and timely. A nice morning."}

{"text":"We were seated promptly due to a very small crowd at 11:00 a.m., and we enjoyed sitting on their patio on a beautiful day.  I ordered the Veggie Head omelette and it was fine, but it could be so much better with the addition of more veggies.  It was packed with under-sauteed green peppers, onions, tomatoes, and avocado.  Adding broccoli, zucchini, and red peppers would be appropriate considering it's called \"Veggie Head.\"  I liked that I could choose pancakes instead of toast and I enjoyed the red potatoes that came with the omelette.  My husband enjoyed his chorizo omelette with hash browns.  Prices were high.  Each entree was $13 and coffee and soda were $3 each, making this restaurant more expensive than the other great options nearby, such as Snooze, Hen House, etc.  Service was okay, but not terrific, and it seemed they were short-staffed today."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood diner spot.  Decor and view are nothing to write home about, but what are you here for?  To be swept away by the ambiance or have breakfast/brunch.  Food portions are very large so be warned, you don't really need sides and add-ons, don't worry, you'll be full.  

Servers are polite and cheerful, it's sort of server by committee rather than one committed server but they do a good job of making the rounds and making sure you have all you need.  The chicken fried steak is my favorite and pretty much everything else I've tried is very good, in all fairness though I never tried any lunch items, but I feel this is more of a breakfast place anyways, it's not as crazy crowded as other places get on weekends.  There will be a wait, but not an insane one.

Only knock on the place is the coffee, it's not bad...but its not good either.  But everything else is pretty damn good for a strip mall diner."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service!! Nicki was the best server, so friendly and efficient!!"}
{"text":"Not many breakfast choices in this area, so pleasantly surprised to find this one though Yelp. Had passed this location a bunch of times, but never heard or saw anything about it. Don't think they advertise. Maybe they don't need to. We've gone four weeks in a row now on a weekend, and each time has been decently busy. Not a ridiculous long wait, but busy.

Like: the Keeping it Simple option. You choose three items for $7.99. A good amount of choices, one of which is two pancakes, which are 7-8 inches and fluffy. Had to take these home. These have been consistent. Hash browns are tasty. Omelets are large. Kids' portions are also a good size. 

Dislike: tables and chairs lack comfort. No booths. Kind of stark interior, like it is temporary. Biscuits need help. The first time, I raved about them, they were so good. The other three times, dry and tasteless. This should be their thing, no?

Overall, the food is good. I don't think the pictures posted do it justice. Almost didn't try it because some of the pictures made the food look greasy. Cleaner than Good Egg. Service is decent. Not spectacular, but no complaints there either. And they have a rewards club. That's always appreciated."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy lunch at the Surprise location frequently.  The food is great, the biscuits are awesome, and the staff is generally friendly.  The rewards program is really rewarding.  I have deducted a star, probably should deduct two,  because this location is quirky about silverware, as in they never seem to remember it.  We are on our fourth visit in a row where they delivered the meal, but we had to ask for silverware.  On the last visit, after waiting five minutes after the food came to get the utensils to eat it, my wife actually walked back to the kitchen and got it herself.  The amazing thing is no one seemed to care! For goodness sakes, there is a Walmart 500 feet away, go buy some more cheap knives and forks!  If the biscuits were not so awesome and the food good, we would drop this place.  Keep making us fight for basic utensils and we will."}
{"text":"Unimpressed, wanted to try somewhere new with my family but it took forever to get the food, then it wasn't hot. Pancakes were overdone and English muffin was too tough. The cinnamon roll French toast was good though."}
{"text":"My favorite biscuits and gravy in town. We always have great service here and the food is on point. This is the best breakfast spot in south Chandler!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time on Saturday and was very happy that I did. This is going to be one of my favorite breakfast places! The staff was top notch with fast friendly service. I had the ham and eggs with a pancake and hash browns. Everything was very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  My friend had the made from scratch corned beef hash and it looked awesome so I will want to try that myself next time. They had a sign on the door \"We don't serve fast food, we serve good food as fast as we can\"  The strawberry preserves were really good, I was tempted to buy a jar of them on my way out. Price was reasonable for the quality and quantity of food I received. I will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Back at my favorite breakfest spot...There food is great..Service is always top notch..All employees are friendly and outgoing..Prices are good..portions are good..And the bonus is its close to my house..They are only open till 2pm which works well for me since I work nights and my morning starts around 11:30am.Try it out sometime...way better then them hole in the wall dinners..Foods alway freshly made and tastes great"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times and run into the same issues as other yelpers.  The food is good but each time I have eaten here my food comes out cold.  The service has been great as the second time I ate here I asked the waitress for a new plate and she accommodated me.  The only problem is that the second plate came out cold as well.  I let here know and she asked if I wanted another plate.  I declined and just ate the cold food.  The place is usually busy when I go so it is quite slow for orders and food delivery.  They may want to step up the kitchen slightly."}
{"text":"Huge menu and pretty good breakfast 
Would recommend as we stop after church and enjoy the cornbeef hash or chicken fried steak
Great portions
Can tend to be very busy on weekends"}
{"text":"great breakfast...had joe's scramble.  very tasty and huge!!  could make 3 meals out of that.  the only thing i didn't like is the cashier took care of you but you paid up front and she printed out the receipt then and there so people were in line and could see whether you left a tip or not and how much if they had great eyes.  not my fav way to check out."}
{"text":"Two stars only because my sister liked her food. Ordered red potatoes with biscuits and turkey bacon. Turkey bacon was as hard as a rock, biscuits were okay! Nothing to have a restaurant named after them. Red potatoes were still hard. Then half way through there was a hair in my dish, not to mention the soggy strawberries they charge as a full side! No thanks!!"}
{"text":"Today we arrived at 8:40 or so. Very busy - Very noisy.  Immediately tried to seat us right at the service station.  Waited 20 min or so to order. The order then took about 45 min. to arrive.  Very understaffed.  When we asked the server if they were short staffed (thinking this was the reason for the poor service) we were told  \"O,  No !\"  Of course not.  No auto coffee refills, or water.  Others who ordered after us were served before us.   At one point the server asked us how everything was -- didn't even look at the table to see we had no food.  Finally after complaining (and asking for a second cup of coffee)  she gave some excuse about not putting the order in the right place.  Been there a number of times, but I will not be back as there are lots of other places you can go in the area."}
{"text":"This is going to rival where I choose to go to for brunch with family and friends 'cause I was pretty loyal to the Egg & I on Arville and Sahara for savory moods/cravings. 
Came here to meet up with one of my best friends, who's one of the establishment's regulars. He gave me the scoops on this place... Family-owned and actually staffed by the family, and everything is freshly made and follows family recipes. 
I had the Zesty Chorizo Omelet, and that plate was a bigger portion than I expected! The biscuits were still hot out of the kitchen, the jam/preserves that's served was yummy! Could honestly tell that it wasn't store-bought. The omelet was the main star of the plate - savory and balanced/cut back with avocados. Hahaha... No salsa needed. One should also order their potatoes crispy per recommendation of our server. 
I can't forget to mention that the customer service was extremely good! I was warmly greeted right away, my friend and I were checked on by our server as soon as I took a seat. Personable conversations too! Hahaha... Not just because my friend makes it easy to chat to, but the owner and his daughter got to genuinely catch up since they last saw each other in the restaurant. 
I'll definitely be asking my friends to meet up here whenever we can get together for brunch, and I'll even try to get my family to try this place sometime soon."}
{"text":"I tried to give 0 stars but yelp requires at least one.  We couldn't even get it. I stood at the counter for 10 minutes trying to get my name down without any service. One woman was checking tables out and there were two employees just standing there. I got smiled at but no other acknowledgement. Then two people came in and said the exact thing I did and got their names down immediately. I asked why my name wasn't put down when asked and again, no response. Terrible experience. We left."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place but am glad I found it! We came here around 8am on a Saturday and JUST beat the rush of the breakfast crowd. They have a big menu and even bigger coffee cups :) Our server was really helpful. I ended up ordering a scramble and ate every last bite. The toast was a favorite as it was a seed bread! I am a fan !"}
{"text":"My husband went here New Year's Eve and ordered the corned beef hash. He said it could have been cooked more especially the potatoes as it was just warm and before he could finish, it was cold.  We came here this morning (January 3, 2015), and I ordered scrambled egg whites (needed to be cooked more), ham and hash browns.  I asked for the hash browns well done, and overall it was just okay.  Husband ordered the pork kielbasa and it was just lukewarm and the hash browns needed to be cooked more. Most of the reviews I read were favorable, but we probably won't be back. Too bad, we were looking for a new breakfast place. Omelet House in Summerlin is way better and very consistent!"}
{"text":"First timers here! Waited about 15 Minutes for a table on a Sunday. Which isn't bad. Our sever Heather was quick got us waters right away and she was very friendly. Food didn't take long. My husband got the chicken fried steak I got the zesty chorizo omelette both came with pancakes! Chicken fried steak was good. My omelette was good there was a lot bell peppers and onions I mean a lot which kinda threw me off but I just picked em out. Gonna be back to try out some other things. I wanna try the avocado toast! My kids shared the kids pancake combo on the kids menu. My 7 year son made the comment that the food was heaven!!! See ya next time Biscuits!"}
{"text":"this is my first time at this restaurant, and my server was brooke . she was very kind and made sure we had drinks by the time we even sat down.  AMAZING! because I was in need of a coffee and quick . lol . she checked on us as our food arrived and even made sure it was right . I would love to bring my friends here and family ! thank you brooke for fantastic service"}
{"text":"Was thrilled to find a new restaurant in Surprise, Arizona.  Attempted to make a reservation for 8 and was disappointed to hear that they didn't take reservations for large parties.  Asked to speak with the manager and was told there were no exceptions.  Was also told if I had a problem with their policy to \"feel free to go elsewhere\".  With that being said, we decided to go elsewhere.  I didn't know how to rate it"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not very tasty.My wife had the sweet potato pancakes and they were horrible and she loves sweet potatoes. She left them uneaten. The waitress offered to bring something else out but by the time time the offer was made I had finished my forgettable strawberry pancakes."}
{"text":"Really good food, and huge portions. Definitely worth the price. Decided to come here instead of the usual chain breakfast places and wasn't disappointed. I definitely will be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I came here to have breakfast this morning.  Sat down at 9:10 walked out at 9:35 with Not one eye contact Not a hi, No here's some water, No service at all.  I sat and watched a family in front of that had already been sitting there get there order taken then food delivered.  Another table to the left of me receive their meal and beverages refilled.  So two different servers at a couple different times and two different helpers to bring out food and whatever the tables needed.  I watched tables that walked in after Me get coffee, water, service and their food.  Very unacceptable service.  There was No Communication between the staff.  People looked at me but noone even asked if I had been helped or offered to help. I won't be trying this place again.  Poor,  poor service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat breakfast. Every single time I've eaten here I've been completely happy. I order the almond crusted french toast almost every time. It is so delicious! My husband is super picky and always makes his order very specific and they've never had a problem with accommodating his picky orders. Their portions are great for the price.  The servers are always in good moods and attentive. I love their rewards program too because it adds up fast."}
{"text":"It was a little below average for me. If the name of your restaurant is biscuits, you better serve some pretty darn good biscuits, and they were not that good. 

We chose to sit outside on a beautiful October morning and were seated right away. I had my infant with me, but they had no sling for his carrier (and apparently their high chairs do not convert to accommodate a carrier either). Therefore, my 3 month old had to sit in his carrier on the ground while I ate; I watched him like a hawk because there were ants close by. Not a good start.

My girlfriend had been here before and said the food was delicious (she doesn't have a good track record for recommending restaurants).
I ordered one biscuit and gravy off the a la carte menu. The waiter said it came with 2 sides??? What? It's a la carte; I don't want a whole meal!?!  Obliging, I picked links and red potatoes, again the red potatoes were raved about by my friend. I'm going to stop taking her suggestions. My plate came out and 3/4 of it was covered by lukewarm red potatoes. Actually, my whole plate was lukewarm; very disappointing. The biscuit had a weird spongy texture, not a good biscuit. I can make better Bisquick biscuits at home. The gravy was ok, not horrible, but nothing to brag about. And, the potatoes, I just didn't get it. I poked around at them hoping they would magically turn into something that tasted good, but I left them on my plate just as they came. 
Would I come back to give them a second chance? Absolutely not. There was not one thing on my plate that was worth the splurge. I make better biscuits and gravy at home. Why would I go out to eat mediocre food?"}
{"text":"Today I visited again with my mom and some friends. It's been quite a while since my last visit so I was sure Biscuits had improved. This was unfortunately not the case. It was around 10 on a Sunday that we went so I was expecting a wait. We only waited about 10 minutes for a table though. \"Impressive,\" I thought. But once we ordered, we waited over 45 minutes for our plates to come out. This time I tried the biscuits, thinking since that was the name of the restaurant, they must be great. They were basically the same quality as KFC. Not that they were bad, but they honestly didn't deserve to be the restaurant's namesake either. I also had the turkey bacon which was hard as a rock. It was tough to cut with a metal knife which was really sad. And my last item, two eggs over medium, came out already punctured. Apparently they still haven't gotten it together here sadly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The corned bee hash is the best I've had in years! The portions were very generous. My daughter raved over how good the pancakes were, and she's not easy to please. This place is definitely a must try if you're in the area. I will be adding this into my weekly breakfast rotation."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Service was great. My four year old said it best, \"Mommy we come here for every breakfast k mommy?\""}
{"text":"We had lunch here for the first time Tuesday. I was dispointed there were no booths only tables. Our server took a while to come by but was very friendly. I ordered the Breakfast burrito and my bf got the meat lovers omelette. My burrito was great, kinda small. The meat lovers omelette had the cheese on top off the omelette rather than inside wich was weird and left it kinda dry. We never got our water refilled and waited a very long time to get the check. We probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The staff was very professional and friendly.  The food brought very quick and coffee was good!  But the food was okay and slightly pricy.  I would go back but maybe try something else"}
{"text":"Thanks to the staff for staying open just a few minutes longer to make me breakfast!This is what Vegas is supposed to be. Great food and great customer service."}
{"text":"Super expensive for what you get.  Very boring and tasteless. Worst omelet I ever had if you call that an omelet! Water down coffee and a horrible pancake. Never come back here again!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident looking for what I thought would be an affordable alternative to Cracked Egg and Dennys, but I was wrong. The least expensive item being one biscuit with gravy and eggs and sausage with a coffee came to just over $12.00 dollars. Not my idea of a reasonable price point for breakfast. The food was ok, not great over the top and certainly not worth that kind of money to have a waitress hovering over me while I am trying to decide whether or not to tip on the bill. Sorry but I wont be back to this place."}
{"text":"\"If you don't eat all your vegetables there won't BE an economic recovery!\" said a frustrated mom to her son right as our group passed her table one recent summer afternoon for a quick lunch. Or at least that's what it sounded to ME like she was saying. The server sat us in right about the middle of the restaurant and my seat faced the window where I could see the Dobson road traffic passing by. I studied the menu looking for something to catch my eye and appetite. I settled on the BBQ Western Bacon Burger. Portions were huge and you get a lot of bang for the buck. The burger was alright but nothing that makes me want to come running back over here for another one. One of my dining companions got the Classic Club sandwich for $10.49 and holy fecal matter, batman! That sandwich was huuuuuuuge! I think that one was definitely meant for sharing. Heck, you could probably feed a family of four with that as long as nobody in that family requires two seats for air travel. But that's a secret for now apparently. The place wasn't packed when we came by. Not sure if this place that once housed the slightly overpriced Vietnamese restaurant Anise (which probably couldn't compete with the two cheaper Vietnamese joints right across the street in the Lee Lee's mall) will make it into our lunch rotation or not. I do know one thing - if I find myself starving and low on cash, the Classic Club is definitely an awesome value meal!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, always greeted with a smile and very polite cashiers. This is a counter order establishment. Place your order and they give you a number to place on your table. They run food out to your table. The portion sizes are great. Have 2 TV's to keep you occupied if needed. Breakfast is available all day."}
{"text":"I'm a French toast fanatic. I've tried a lot French toast platters at different restaurants. This place wins tho. Best French toast I have ever had. Almond crusted for the win. If you go, by all means - get it. It's excellent. Service was good, and it has a friendly vibe. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! I went on a Saturday morning, didn't have to wait to be seated because the place was huge. 
I saw huevos rancheros on Yelp so I asked if they could make them for me (because they weren't on the menu) and they were able to. They were delicious."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice and friendly. Touching the menu made me have to go to the bathroom and clean my hands, sticky film all over the menu and table. Silverware, cups and plates were filthy to the point of me not being able to touch the cup of coffee, I asked for a different set and the issue was identical, no one seemed to care so i washed it myself in the bathroom. Food was horrendous, the portions were huge but 10 pounds of copper is still cheaper than one gram of gold. 

I ordered the turkey reuben, i dont think anyone else ordered anything turkey since it seems like it was left over from thanksgiving. Wife had sausage and eggs with pancakes, the sausages angered the chef so the chef punished them by burning them to the ground, pancakes were raw in the middle and the eggs were runny. No one really cared, they handed a check and left."}
{"text":"Well... not my favorite restaurant for breakfast, but not horrible either. We've been wanting to try it for awhile. The staff is very friendly and accommodating I ordered biscuits and gravy and for a restaurant with biscuits in the name the actual biscuits are very disappointing. They are very, very tiny. The hubby enjoyed his chicken and waffles, but I can't get over my biscuit disappointment. lol So, I think we'll stick with our usual place from now on."}
{"text":"this place is really hit or miss. The first time I came here, we all got things like pancakes and French toast. those were yummy, but anything else we've ordered on the menu turns out pretty terrible. if you want sweet things, this place is good. otherwise, just find another place for lunch."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast spot. Ample seating. Clean. Friendly staff.

I have been here a couple times and have never had to wait for a seat or long for my food. I also haven't come here on a busy weekend day when most people go out to breakfast. If you are coming by after church on Sunday, chances are there will be a wait for both.

I've had the corned beef hash and the chicken fried steak. Corned beef was okay, chicken friend steak was great. Red potatoes are delicious, biscuits are a must but nothing to write home about, and the pancakes are large and a must have as well. The coffee mugs are large and are refilled often.

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If I could leave a negative star review, I would. We waited over 45 minutes for our undercooked breakfast. The scramble that we ordered was wet with some unknown fluid. We sent it back and the one we received in return also was wet. The French toast was under cooked and the bacon was  extremely chewy. I wouldn't even recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"First time here. It was okay. 

The Good: Restaurant is bright and clean. Food came fast. Service was excellent from both our server and the bus staffer.

The Not-so-Good: Coffee was weak. Food was above average but just above. Extremely expensive. Omelets are all $12 and up. Biscuits and Gravy is $11 with two biscuits and an egg and bacon. Coffee was $2.50. Orange juice was $2.50 for a small glass.

I guess I just don't expect to pay $19 (before tax and tip) for scrambled eggs with ham, hash browns, two pancakes, coffee, and a small OJ."}
{"text":"I went here once for lunch with some co-workers. Portion sizes are great. The server was attentive. I ordered a veggie omelet and was not overly impressed. It's was okay, not great but not horrible."}
{"text":"UPDATED BELOW: My wife, sister in law and I ate here Sunday april 16, 2017 @11:30am.

Pros - Nicely decorated. Food was OK, not great but not terrible tasting.

Cons - 1) expensive for what you get, $55 for 3 breakfasts, none were steaks.
2) Had the wrong cheese on sister's scrambled eggs, took forever to get it corrected, almost as we were leaving did they finally show up.
3) after we left, my wife and I both immediately had diarrhea for 2 straight days
4) restaurant had problems with their checkout terminal, they ended up charging me 3 times for the meal.
5) put the meal on my credit card, so with the overcharges, I have over $110 of credit limit tied up for several days until this finally works itself out.
6) went back to the restaurant monday april 17,2017 to try and get it resolved, told it would take an additional 3 days for the credit to appear by a manager who never offered his name or an apology for the inconvenience.

Will never go back, and will share our experience with others.

UPDATE - UPDATE
UPDATE - the credit card situation finally worked itself out, the 2 additional charges fell off my account as a function the system, not anything Biscuits did according to my credit card company;"}
{"text":"Been going there for years with my wife always fresh food served hot at a great price and friendly servers"}
{"text":"Went here back on Easter 2018 and just got around to reviewing but I it was great! My boyfriend and I were in the area, looked on Yelp for a place to eat and stopped in. Worried about it being packed we tried anyway. It was packed but we sat down within 10 minutes and was waited upon fast. They were pretty efficient and quick to get the food out. The food was really good and the service was too. He had a Denver omelet and he ate the whole thing and it was huge. I usually order Corned Beef and Hash at breakfast restaurants because it is not something you get at home and I love it. This place set the bar for my favorite breakfast food. This place made it from scratch, tender shredded corned beef and fresh chopped potatoes and eggs over easy, just right. I was expecting the stuff out of the can! And it was so much food I could not eat it all, took some home and ate it for lunch. My boyfriend was still full from his breakfast he skipped lunch. 
There are other locations but none nearby me but next time I'm in the area of one it definitely will be my top choice for good grub."}
{"text":"The worst breakfast I've had in LV in 15 yrs.I had the biscuits & gravy combo 2 eggs,ham terrible the ham was so tough and over cooked even the steak knife wouldn't cut it let alone chew it,the biscuits as well were very hard and the eggs over medium were burned at the edges the coffee was no bargin either very bitter after4 sugars,lousy the prices are way high for what you get."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome service!! They have a really good cafe mocha and the biscuits and gravy are to die for!"}
{"text":"Been here many times for breakfast and haven't had a bad experience! The restaurant is usually busy on the weekends so the wait is quite long but during the weekdays, it's not too packed. 

I think the food taste great! Their coffee is always served fresh & hot, which I love. The food portions are pretty huge so I'm always stuffed by the time I leave. Overall, great breakfast place! Not amazing but still recommend!"}
{"text":"We waited over an hour to get our food, and many tables around us were threatening to leave when they finally got their food as well. The cinnamon roll was good (probably too much icing for my taste!) and the people were nice, but they must have been missing a cook for how long the wait was."}
{"text":"Huge portions with some inconsistencies ~

I'll say this, the amount of food you get here is insane. I can never finish anything. My favorite part of the meal are the great biscuits that come with butter & a variety of jams, best ones are the strawberry & raspberry. 

The service is always extremely friendly & I love the fresh OJ they serve. My man really likes this place & it's literally across the street from our home so it's always very convenient. 

My food isn't always cooked the way I like. For starters the potatoes tend to have softer & harder bites. Slice them up more evenly & that'll allow them to cook the right way. My bacon tends to come out on the very crispy side and I've asked them to not do so. Lastly I get my eggs over medium & always find the white parts still gooey. 

The prices here are high compared to some of the other breakfast options & I hope some of my feedback gets to the cooks. I support small businesses and maybe offer smaller portions at cheaper prices as well?"}
{"text":"Way over priced and the food really had no flavor. $35 (with tip) for two people for breakfast is ridiculous.  Service wasn't great either and they weren't busy.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it is so close to our house but I was sorely disappointed. I visited with my mom, sister and my 4 year-old daughter. I will start with the good - when we arrived at 10:15 on a Sunday morning we were told there was a 20 minute wait. We were seated within 10 minutes so that was a pleasant surprise. The sourdough toast and biscuits were good and the strawberry preserves were excellent. But none of that made up for all the bad. Our waitress was a very nice older woman, but she was spread so thin it took a long time to get our orders after we were seated. My mom ordered the turkey and veggie scramble and it arrived with NO turkey. It took so long to get our food and our waitress never came back so she just decided to eat it. The scramble looked very wet from the moisture in the veggies but my mom said it was tasty. I had chicken fried steak and thought it would be house-made and fresh. Nope. It was a smallish, dried out piece crusty \"meat\" that I am positive came out of the freezer. The hash browns were just ok and as I said the toast was very good. My daughter seemed to love her pancakes and my sister had a cheeseburger that was sloppy with way too much mayo. She had to wipe off the mayo just to make the burger palatable. Once she did that she said it was good. At one point my 4 year-old dropped her napkin on the ground. I did not realize it but a hostess walked by, picked the napkin OFF OF THE FLOOR and put it back on our table. I was mortified! I asked her if she could please bring us a clean napkin and she looked pretty put out by the request. When she returned with the napkin I mentioned that she should not pick something up off the floor and put it on the table where customers are eating. She rolled her eyes and spun on her heels without so much as an apology. She continued to give me icy looks every time she looked our way. I guess she thinks giving guests dirty napkins OFF THE FLOOR is perfectly acceptable and we were in the wrong for thinking otherwise. Halfway through our meal I put in an order for a salad to bring home to my husband. We did not get that to-go order until 25 minutes AFTER our meal. We sat at our table waiting without drink refills, just waiting, waiting and waiting. We didn't even get our check in a timely fashion so we could pay and head out as soon as our to-go order finally arrived, so we were forced to sit and wait getting shady looks from the hostess we \"offended\" the entire time. It was awkward. The to-go order finally arrived. We paid and finally were able to leave. I think the prices were kinda high for the quality and quantity of food. Our waitress was nice and kindly took $5 off our bill due to the missing turkey from the scramble. She also kept talking up the rewards program but I did not bother to sign up because I will not be returning. The disappointment continued even once I got home - my husband opened up his salad and discovered an inedible mess. They put toasted garlic bread and hot crispy chicken in with the greens which caused steam in the container. The top layer of greens was a soggy mess and the moisture/steam also caused the garlic toast to become soggy. He ate 2 bites and tossed it. Such a drag. The great preserves and good biscuits are definitely not worth returning for that kind of debacle. And note to management - you really need to talk to the staff about sanitary practices. Items should NEVER EVER be picked up off the floor and put on a surface where customers are dining. This should be common sense to anybody but especially to someone working in the food service industry. And your hostess seemed to think nothing of the action."}
{"text":"Any place with breakfast tacos on the menu automatically garners my immediate attention. Growing up in Texas, bfast tacos are a diet staple but outside those state lines you can only find breakfast burritos- which are totally NOT the same thing. At all. 

Plate here includes two massive tacos on double-layer corn, with options to add sausage, chorizo, or bacon to your eggs, cheese is included and condiments of sour cream and salsa are provided. You also get a potato side (reds or browns).
Huge portion: tortillas were overflowing, removed over half the filling before I could even pick up the tacos to eat properly (not a complaint!), and the corn tortillas held up so well that I was able to stick to a single layer and used the extras to make additional tacos with the overflow!
Not following? You can easily make 4 good sized tacos with this plate.

Chicken fajita omelet is a good pick too- potato side and bread side included (toast, english muffin, or biscuit). Servers have no problem with substitutions, and easily changed out my bell peppers for extra mushrooms. Sadly, the mushrooms seemed canned, but there as a more than generous portion of veggies in the dish. Hashbrowns were undercooked, but we didn't come close to finishing.

Now for my gripe. You're the BISCUIT Café- not the breakfast taco café, not the omelet cafe. The biscuits here were lackluster and dismal, with little taste and an oddly crunchy exterior. Fluffy interior was great and the raspberry jam we received was off the charts, but when we ordered a side of gravy ... well, that was bad, too. Virtually tasteless and gluey, like a poorly made box mix. 

I didn't expect the breakfast tacos to knock it out of the park like they did (highly recommend the bacon and chorizo), but to fail at making your namesake dish? Really bummed by that.
Service was amazing and even at 10:30AM on a weekend, there were a few tables available without a wait. But the line was out the door by noon!"}
{"text":"Service was good- decor great- food good but high prices for area- $ for $ I would rather spend this amount of money for breakfast at Snooze in Gilbert."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Prices appear a bit higher than other breakfast places, but you get huge servings for that. We came on a weekday for breakfast and it was quiet and service was great. On the weekends they sometimes have long lines which has deterred us in the past but not anymore! My hot tea came with a big selection of tea bags (while other places like Village Inn limit the number of tea bags you're allowed to have) to choose from, the food tasted great and the atmosphere pleasant. I've added pictures to show the food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch place. They have big fluffy pancakes and yummy biscuits and gravy yum 

The place is a bit cold inside but the service is nice and attentive. They have daily specials that focus on American traditional meals. 

Try their biscuits and gravy or chicken fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I've been in Arizona for a year, and the staff at this place was the only thing holding me back from giving a decent review. They have greatly improved their customer service, from grumpy and indifferent to cheerful and attentive! The meals here are large and delicious, they even have 4-egg omelets!!! It's definitely worth a try if you're looking for a bright and tasty alternative from your Sunday morning breakfast norm."}
{"text":"Great food and prices! Even though it's packed on the weekends, service and seating has always been on point. The pancakes and eggs benedicts are delicious! Lunch time? Try their sandwiches and you won't go hungry. Great family atmosphere and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Seated right away and our waitress was attentive and patient as it took me a little while to pick what I wanted from their abundant menu. 
The actual food: not good. I ordered the blueberry pancake combo with scrambled eggs and sausage patties. The eggs were fine but the sausage was somehow bland and tasteless. I'm not sure how that can happen with sausage but, that was the case were. The same was true with the 3 blueberry pancakes: bland and tasteless (and somewhat dry). It appeared there were blue berries in the cakes as well as some on top, but you just couldn't taste them. 
You can get plain pancakes from a number of other breakfast places, or even make them yourself, and I'm sure they'd have more flavor than these blueberry pancakes. 

In short, service was good, the problem is in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I had been told the food was amazing, though I didn't get to experience such myself as we waited 40 minutes with only our drinks after we had placed our order. A server didn't check to ask how we were or apologize for the wait, nor let us know when we should be expecting our order. The water was alright though."}
{"text":"They misplaced our order!  After waiting for our order for 30 minutes, I inquired with our waitress where our food was, as parties that came in after us had received their food already. Our waitress was rude and said, \"I put it in!\"  And she walked away. After not hearing back from her or anyone else, I asked for a manager and after a few more minutes our happy waitress showed up with our food. We were already on our way out when the manager showed up. I explained the situation to him and he said they had lost our order and that he was there when they whipped our order out for us. I told him that our server was rude to us, never checked back with us to see how we were doing and did not notice or care that we had not received our order. Nor did she ever apologize.  For that reason we won't stay or be back. Why should WE have to check on our food?  And we liked Biscuits' food and service in the past."}
{"text":"I went with my husband and son. My husband ordered the chicken and waffle with eggs. He had to remind our server that he ordered eggs. The waffle was fine, but the chicken strips were obviously not fresh, and everything was over cooked and lacked flavor. I ordered the country omelette with red potatoes and biscuits. The only good thing on the plate was the strawberry jam. The omelette was filled with what seemed to be old food. The potatoes were soggy, and absolutely no flavor. Even the gravy was poorly executed. We were never offered refills on our drinks. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Slowly but surely getting their stuff together. 

The last time I came in, the manager was very friendly. She addressed me by my first name so she must have read my last review (whoops).

The food has been better. That's why I'm changing my review. It was hot and ready when I got there. They are doing bigger portions too. Nothing was burnt this time.

Keep it up guys, is getting better!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for breakfast, except for the coffee. I come here often and have tried a few different breakfast plates. All have been very delicious, glad that i found this place. The only thing I don't like here is their coffee, but then again, it is not a coffee shop so..."}
{"text":"We came in for the first time this morning.  We tried 2 different breakfasts and were happy with both.  However the floors are filthy, which makes us wonder if the kitchen is clean. The restrooms are filthy.  The waitstaff is very nice . Service is fast. Food is served hot.  Portions are large."}
{"text":"I was excited to see another breakfast place open up in town, close by and I finally got a chance to try Biscuits this morning.

The place is nice and modern.  It was clean and the staff greeted and seated my quickly.  Unfortunately the food was greasy spoon quality.  The hashbrowns were cooked with a nice crust but were dripping with grease throughout.  The sausage also had a thick sheen of grease. The toast had that nasty butter substitute that cafes soak their toast in.  If the place would ease up on the grill grease t would probably be worthwhile but starting the morning off with a gut ache isn't what I am looking for."}
{"text":"I've been debating whether to give a review on this restaurant. I've had many friends at church recommend this restaurant.

So I tried it this restaurant after dropping off my daughter and her friends at North Mountain Park so  they could go hiking.

I was by myself in a dress shirt and dress slacks,  asked for a small table and they try to place me behind the planter at a table for 4.

First time here so it took time to read the menu.  And was thoroughly disappointed!  My order was half cooked and gooey.  Ordered the cinnamon roll French toast with Ham and eggs.

Actually was served my food at the same time as the people who ordered before me at the nearby tables.

Except for a Italian and a Greek or possibly middle eastern persons who were with different groups of Caucasian  people, I was the only one who was not Caucasian in the restaurant... except for some of the kitchen staff.

I was not dressed like a wet back, as I said before I was in a dress shirt, dress slacks and had a nice coat.

It's been a long time, since my teenage years, that I had experienced racism at a restaurant.  I was polite did not make a scene and behaved properly pertaining to proper restaurant etiquette.

In fact the older couple  at the table next to me, when they saw that I knew how to eat properly with a place setting realized that I was well mannered and relaxed.

Despite that the restaurant tried to rush me out of the store because I was out in plain sight.   Yes, it was very busy, but I didn't see any of the other customers being served \"extra quickly\".  There were many other customers drinking free refills of coffee and taking their time.

The servers had no problem and actually appoligized.  Tipped the server more than 20% despite the bad treatment.  It was very evident the female manager on duty had the issue not the servers.

I cannot recommend a place that's still in the 19th century as it comes to Attitudes of those of different races."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an upscale Denny's, you will love this place. For a place called Biscuits, the biscuit was tiny. They really should call this place cornbreads instead. The food as a whole was underwhelming especially for the price. Two meals and two cokes $36."}
{"text":"I tried to place an order over the phone and the phone is disconnected. Sadly I see they have closed. Just so disappointing"}
{"text":"The greeting at the door was awkward as I waited to be sat or find out if I seat myself. The hostes must have not knew what  she was doing or was  overwhelmed from the day. Anyways ,best part of the meal was the biscuits. The gravy was thick and creamy to smother the average size biscuits. No alcohol served so my beverage was a grapefriut juice and that shit was very concentrated.Service was a little slow but had no  problems occur.Nothin special about this joint."}
{"text":"A nice change. Home style cooking and very pleasant staff. The food was well portioned for the price. I recommend the country eggs benedicts."}
{"text":"My friend & I had brunch at Biscuits Cafe and we both felt the food was DELISH. We also were in shock that it came out in what felt like 5 minutes after we ordered despite the restaurant being busy. I am super picky about my eggs (I walk a fine line between loving them & getting grossed out by them) but I believe the scrambled eggs that I was served were enough to make me want to go back again, and again! Also, I felt that they gave liberal portions which is welcomed by me as I would like to feel like choosing to go out instead of staying home to make breakfast was worth it (bang for my buck, ya know?). I WISH they served mimosas or that they featured a small \"morning fix\" menu.  We were disappointed when it seemed like this place dedicated to ALL things breakfast/brunch/lunch did not. I also hope that one day they can expand their patio or offer heaters as sitting on shady side of the building in December was not an option even though the sunny side made it seem like sitting outside would have been perfect. All in all, I am happy I got to experience Biscuits Cafe and I will for sure return."}
{"text":"Amazing food great service and atmosphere... Definitely will be back! Had the most wonderful egg white scramble with spinach, mushroom, tomato and avocado... The preserves were exquisite."}
{"text":"Good delicious. Great biscuits jam gravy. Little back log on paying at register. Late bringing utensils after food. But sweet waitress. Busy time too."}
{"text":"The food and service were OK. However the buttermilk pancakes were not very flavorful. Also both my pancakes and sausage were over done on the outside. They must have had the griddle too hot. 

The sausage gravy is very good though. All together, my wife and I like Crackers Cafe much better."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The place is clean. The staff was friendly. The food is great. The portion sizes were all were huge. Being from the south it's hard to find decent biscuits in a restaurant. Their biscuits are good. This place is a rare find. Two thumbs up. I live in Henderson but my wife and I found ourselves on that side of town for business when we ran across this place by accident. All around it was a great experience. I highly recommend this place. I wish they would open one in Henderson."}
{"text":"I tried them for lunch and wasn't impressed.  Now I decided to give them another try, this time for breakfast.  After all, you'd expect a place called the Biscuits Cafe to have great biscuits.  The facility is clean and well lit and the staff is friendly.  It was rather busy, but service was fast and I got my coffee without any delay.  I ordered ham & eggs with hash browns and biscuits.  I HAD to try the biscuits!  The food was not bad, but it wasn't all that good either.  My waitress checked back several times and I was offered refills on my coffee, which made me happy. 

As for the biscuits......I was told that they made them there in their kitchen.  I find that difficult to believe.  They seemed more like something you buy readymade but unbaked, then pop into the oven so you can say they are baked on site.  I'm sorry folks, but I expected better biscuits from a place that is named for them. 

The 3 star rating is for the prompt and friendly service, since the food rated no stars with me."}
{"text":"We love trying new places but I guess all of them can't be good. Food was mediocre, could have make a better BLT at home. My husband tried to say he liked his food but he didn't even touch the caramelized apples that came on his French toast, which isn't like him. Kids got pancakes, can't go wrong with those. Also, super bummed I couldn't get a mimosa at brunch because they don't serve alcohol. Boo hoo."}
{"text":"Great biscuits and a great breakfast. Their eggs Benedict are wonderful. Just wish they were open for dinner"}
{"text":"I always look to Yelp for great restaurants to try.  We stumbled upon this place (we thought we were going to a similarly named place).  It's a great atmosphere inside - clean and welcoming.  I love biscuits and gravy and am always on the hunt for \"the best\".  Well, I will look no farther.  

What a great location - right by ASU.  My after-college aged son had so much food due to their generous portion size.  Perfect for him.  

It was quiet in there today - since it's summer in Arizona and college is out of session.  I'd imagine it is a hang out for the locals and college kids alike."}
{"text":"Not sure what previous yelper is talking about.  Place was packed when we walked in with six of us. Sat us withen 5 minutes and took our order right away. Manager came over twice to see how things were going.  The waitress overheard my daughter say it was my nephews first birthday. She brought out a strawberry shortcake and candle. First class all the way."}
{"text":"Slow service... Not very nice... Food is kind of gross... Berries taste like frozen mush with water... Pancakes weren't cooked all the way through they still had gooey batter in the middle... Coffee tastes like water... Waitress took 10 minutes before seeing us... 

Just not a good experience. I won't be coming back. This is worse than those grungy dive bars when it comes to quality of food."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy is such a classic comfort food. I also had the hash and was very pleased."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom, stepdad, and baby brother for Mother's Day so it was very busy. Despite it being so busy, the service was still excellent. All the employees were so friendly and the food was delicious. Everything came out very quick and exactly how we all wanted it. The atmosphere is also very cute and warm. I will continue to come here and spread the word and get this place noticed!"}
{"text":"First text to this Biscuits location.  It is noisey from all hard surfaces.  Could be problematic for those with hearing aids n No cushy booths for relaxation & comfort.  Our server, Jen, was most attentive, friendly, & pleasant with a smile. The food was mediocre, but, plentiful, especially the hash brown,. Cinnamon roll was a 5\"x5\" sheet baked goods smothered with melted frosting that surpassed my calarie intake lit for today & tomorrow.  O just wish they offered it with nuts and raisons for texture variation.pruces exceed all of the other breakfast serving restaurants by at least 15% which were comparable to a 4-star resort, minus the ambiance.  Probably won't be back.  Sorry Jen."}
{"text":"Really good service and great food. Will definitely have more breakfast at this very good spot. Probably our most favorite place for breakfast!!!!"}
{"text":"First time I was not expecting it to be as good as it was. It was amazing I had the Greek omelet. Never had something like that it had a really good taste"}
{"text":"Decent place to have breakfast. About 25% above any other place. Never had a breakfast with only one peace of toast. Could be a deal breaker"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and great prices. Never disappointed when I come for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"We are happy to see a new breakfast place near us!  customer service was wonderful...and attentive. the staff was all smiles and on top of everything. the place was clean and bigger than we had expected which will be nice once the word gets out that they are open and have yummy food. the prices are great for the portions. I had the avocado egg benedict and loved it. My son who never eats much had the kids chocolate chip pancake with eggs and he ate the entire thing ( with little brothers help) ....big kids plate!  Don't remember what hubby had but his plate didn't last long!  We will definitely become regulars."}
{"text":"This is right across the street from my house and is my go to breakfast place now. I also live close to Hash House, Hash House a Go Go, and Babystakcs. Biscuits is my preferred place for the following reasons

-no wait- it is really large with lots of seating and I have never had to wait for a seat- waiting is for suckers
-good food to price ration- a breakfast is like 10 dollars and is more food than I can eat in one setting. Meals come with eggs, potatoes, and pancakes in addition to your main entree item. Its a solid deal


Everything I have gotten has been good, but here are a few favorites
-Brisket Benedict - this is a special that is only available sometime but if it is snatch it up
-Corned beef hash- made in house, is really good
-Country fried steak- one of my all time favorites and its good here- excellent gravy
-Southwest scramble- chorizo, avocado, salsa, served with tortillas- whats not to love 

Also, they have pretty good biscuits that come with an awesome seemingly fancy preserves that is great. Even if I don't get biscuits with my meal cause I want pancakes I usually order a side of biscuits."}
{"text":"The pancakes are excellent. I have never had better. Chicken fried chicken was average but the gravy was better. The hash browns would have been awesome if they were hot. My eggs over easy we're undercooked. Outside patio is very nice. The inside not so nice. I would go back for the pancakes."}
{"text":"Stood at the counter for five minutes waiting to be seated, staff made eye contact but continued about their business. Didn't smell appealing and prices were questionable. Decided to leave, no one said a word."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Nice atmosphere. Super cute and you get a good amount of food for the price. They seriously had the best pancakes I've ever eaten. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was great! I chose a sandwich. When the waitress put the plate in front of me. I said to my mom good thing we are sharing on the side with the sandwich was frys they were great. One bad this is that the prices rate to $8-$11. Over all good service, and very nice place I would go again good food. :)"}
{"text":"Almond crusted French toast was delicious!! Can't wait to have it again. Nothing special about the eggs, bacon."}
{"text":"Fast service. Lots of space. Food was okay. Maybe a little more the okay. It was bland which I like so I can add the amount of flavor (salt) to the food that I want. The place had lots of regulars coming and going. You can call in your order."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd trip to Biscuits Cafe in 3 weeks. This time I'm with some family from out of town. 
The food never disappoints! Large portions of perfectly prepared comfort food. 
I had the chicken fried steak today, with 2 eggs over easy, red potatoes  (so good, I highly recommend them over the hash browns) and one biscuit with gravy. I am very satisfied right now!
Based on feedback from my companions, so are they!"}
{"text":"I like this place, although this weekend we visited for breakfast & the time it took to get our food was beyond ridiculous. Our waitress knew it was too as she stopped by the table at one point after we'd been waiting forever and said \"there's two tickets ahead of you and then your food will be out\". When we finally got our food it was cold. I was really frustrated because we had waited so long and we were short on time as it was. When we let them know of the cold food, they took the food back and returned a short time later with fresh food that was hot. I don't expect to get something for nothing however the waitress only took a soda off the bill. After as long as we waited for the food and then having it arrive cold and having to wait again for it, there should have been more of a discount than a soda. I didn't have time to mess around with that though as I mentioned we were crunched for time."}
{"text":"I continue to be not happy with this restaurant. As I was walking in the door, a couple was walking out & said \"Well I guess we won't be coming back here again!\" It was a Sunday morning so I expected it to be busy. We waited 20 minutes to be seated. Not bad for a Sun morning. We were seated, & waited. And waited. And waited. We rec'd our drink order. Then finally our food order was taken. And THEN we're told the kitchen was running 40 minutes! We left. 
Other issues on other visits. The red potatoes for breakfast are always cold inside. I asked it they were frozen & just didn't cook thru. I was told no. Well after 3-4 times with cold potatoes give it up. Also I have been given a menu so dirty looking that I want to wash my hands after handling it. The servers are always nice. But no more. I will not go back again."}
{"text":"Tried Biscuits again last week. They cannot make an egg over easy. The whites have to be cooked while the yolk is still runny. This is not rocket science."}
{"text":"My kids get so excited when I tell them we are going to Biscuits Cafe. They love the chocolate chip pancakes. There is never a wait service is always quick. The staff is amazing and remembered us after only 2 visits. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Big portions and have never had to wait for a table, even on the weekends. I really like their points/reward program, just recently received  $5 off our bill. Food is always great and the staff is very nice and attentive. Try an omelette, all of them are unique and delicious and you can even get pancakes with them without having to pay an additional cost! This is our new favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Being generous with the stars. 
Was Recommended to me as a nice old fashion breakfast. They have  a sign on the wall in the restaurant that's says \"we don't serve fast food we serve greasy food as fast as we can.  
The waitress was five stars. Felt sorry for her. but the food took time to be delivered. When it did arrive very cold. But look great and I'm sure if it had been hot would have been fantastic. The problem there was 20 tables and only two waitresses. No the feeling management citing corners doesn't help. 
But plan on giving you another chance. Hope next a 5 star visit."}
{"text":"My first (and last) visit.  I ate a late breakfast there.  The menu is a heart attack waiting to happen and appealing to those who are already overweight.  Packed with fat and empty calories.  The one item that seemed feasable was the veggie omelette.  Terrible.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"The quality overall was average, great gravy and hash browns. It gets very busy on weekends so be sure to get there early. The atmosphere is a bit boring."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast. We have been several times and rarely do we have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table. Today we are seated right away,  and our server was at the table in less than a minute. The food is always good. Today tried the avacodo Benedict. ..husband got the scramble special, with pumpkin pancakes  (seasonal. .yum!) Food and beverages delivered timely. .great spot."}
{"text":"The Service and Food are great!!  Natalie and Richard took very goog care of me.  It's not often I remember the servers names but this place feels like home.  The food was hot and tasty.  A real family hot spot, the kids had a blast.  We needed a new breakfast place in Chandler and Biscuits fills the void.  The Jams and Jellies are out of this world.  Will be back many times over."}
{"text":"Two weeks now, having trouble getting the quality out of the kitchen, my requests are being ignored. This may have been my last trip here!"}
{"text":"One thing I'll remember about Biscuits Cafe is...well... THEIR BISCUITS AND RASPBERRY JAM. We were sat instantly and were greeted by a friendly waitress. Once we ordered almost ten minutes later our food came out. Very quick service, which we loved since we were starving!
I was in the mood for some pancakes so I ordered 3 pancakes,eggs and sausage links for around 10 dollars. 

Next time I come I won't get the pancakes because for me they tasted almost identical to McDonald's hot cakes.
I stole a bite of my mom's biscuit, which are moist and fluffy, I really recommend trying some if you stop in!"}
{"text":"Waited anxiously for this to open.  Sigh!  My last review was based on price and I hate to say it again but this was way too expensive.  Ok I ordered over medium eggs.  The whites were runny.  Gag, gag.  The bacon was very tasty but I ordered extra crispy and it was not at all.  Also has French toast and it was delicious.  My husband ordered sausage patties and didn't like  them at all. Said it had no flavor and was overcooked. His eggs were over medium medium and were fine.  Now the biscuits and gravy he had were gross.  He even had me try them to confirm.  Yeah, they were gross.  Our thought is \"one and done.\". The price for all that was outrageous.  Our server kept calling us dear.  My personal pet peeve.  Won't be returning.  Won't bother to try lunch.  Skip breakfast here and go to Denny's."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in for breakfast about 930 today and  were greeted warmly, served promptly and had the best meal since moving here in 1973!  We could not believe our eyes when the server placed our order in front of us.  The food looked too good to eat.  The food tasted even better.  The portions were way beyond what  we could possibly eat.

My favorite meal is breakfast and I have prepared many and have eaten way too many bad ones out.  This was the best ever.  N/w corner of Warner and Dobson .  

A little information-  I gave this place a try because I had the opportunity to see the kitchen a few weeks prior.  Spotless!  The cleanest restaurant kitchen I have ever been in.   

Worth every penny."}
{"text":"There is Biscuits and then there is Biscuits cafe. They are the same idea but two very different experiences. Head to Biscuits Cafe if you'd like to be sat at a dirty table and wait 10+ minutes for your server to arrive to take your drink order. We left and went down the road to a different location where we knew we'd get service. 

Rating this 2 stars ONLY because I'm hoping people will go to BISCUITS not this place. The original Biscuits is great - good food and service. Not here!"}
{"text":"Great service and food was hot and very reasonably priced, waitress was very friendly and helpful.i had Joes scramble and my wife had the southwest scramble mine came with the redskin potatoes that were good ,but could have been cooked just a little longer, wife got hash browns and they were terrific, both orders came with the pancakes and were hot and very enjoyable, overall a great experience and will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Carrie our server was 10 stars. Make that 110 stars. An old school waitress with the look to match. Food was ok. Red potatoes were hard. Bacon was good Hollandaise sauce was good. Cinnamon roll was good. Wife's Poached hard eggs were underdone but fixed. Going back to Carrie......damn she was incredible. A trait rarely found in the business today. I would love to hire her for my business. She is a gem."}
{"text":"Honestly, as far as breakfast places go, I wasn't too impressed. I went here pretty recently but the fact that I don't remember much about the decor should be a good indicator about how I felt. It was just...average.

As far as the food goes, it's also pretty average. I had the chocolate chip pancakes which were generously portioned and decent. I just wouldn't make the effort to return here. There are just too many delicious restaurants out there to try!"}
{"text":"Very attentive staff as they started to get busy on a Sunday morning. Large diverse menu that offers breakfast and lunch items. I ordered Joe's scramble which was delicious with fresh spinach.  My husband had the corned beef which was homemade.  Large portions so we ended up taking some home. Great food, great service, good price."}
{"text":"The biscuits weren't amazing and the food and price was okay."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place!! Large portions at a reasonable price! Phenomenal biscuits and gravy!! Make sure to try the homemade strawberry jam!"}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Went here the other day before work thinking it was a great place to have breakfast. I looked at the menu online to find what i wanted. Went inside and order biscuits and gravy with a side of hashbrowns. Cost me about $13 which way more than i expected.Got my food fairly quick which was nice but by time i got to my work, which was 5 mins away, my food wasnt  hot at all. The biscuits tasted very doughy and under cooked. The eggs were ok but almost cold. The hasbrowns were toasted nicely but were tasteless. They didnt even have salt on them. They tasted like water. As if they were boild, cut up, and then heated on a stove without any seasoning. I did like the taste and size of the sausage links however, they were the only thing i liked about my meal. I will not return"}
{"text":"Always the best food. (Coming from the wife of a chef) please Eli bring in the grits! Chaz was our server and he was awesome.... spot on. Just think grits would be a great side option. Thanks for making my Easter breakfast perfect."}
{"text":"This place is busy! The wait is like twenty five minutes during brunch time. And after we ordered our meals, we waited at least another twenty to thirty minutes to receive the food. Make sure have good conversations with your party because to make up the time for the wait! I ordered my fave dish the Chicken Fried Steak and it was delish! The portions are generous, it came with red potatoes, eggs and biscuits. At my surprise, the dish delivered to me warm. 

Furthermore, it was bad timing when we dined during the New Year. May be I'll try this restaurant again during non-holiday or weekend days. I'll give is a second chance to try other dishes on the menu. So far, the dish that I ordered made the difference on the four star rating."}
{"text":"Hubs and I had breakfast/lunch at Biscuits Cafe in Surprise today and it was a truly great experience. I had pancakes, eggs over medium and bacon. The pancakes were great and I'm picky, the eggs were indeed over medium and the bacon was crisp. So often I have been to places where the iced tea is more like water. Today, it was nice to have a well steeped glass of iced tea. The real stuff, not the crap that comes out of a fountain machine. My hubs had the California Club that had actual carved turkey, crisp bacon, avocado, tomato, lettuce, Swiss cheese on a hoagie roll. Along with that, he had the creamy chicken and wild rice soup. He said his lunch was fantastic. Portions are also generous. The decor is lovely and inviting, giving an air of feeling like home. Ashley was our server and she was so sweet, very respectful and quickly returned with whatever we asked for. Don't let the road construction keep your from visiting this new establishment! They're open until 2:30 pm during the week. Thanks, happy Biscuit people for a great experience! :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today, its only about 10 minutes from my house, I have a newborn at home so I wanted something quick and easy. I left my wife at home with our child amd brougjt our roommate along to help carry food. I ordered a southwest scramble without bell peppers, when I got home my scramble had bell peppers. My roommate and my wife both wanted the fajita omelette, which is supposed to come with salsa, neither did. Lastly the hash browns were pretty dull, not cooked through and lacked any real taste."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened today but this visit was a horrible experience. Certain my husband will never come back:

1. 1 hr 20 minutes for breakfast for 2 people
2. Would have been faster to drive to circle k for coffee refill and come back. 
3. Waffle not cooked
4. Buttered \"dry rye\" toast
5. Cold food when it arrived
6. Water came with lemon and took 15 minutes to get plain water
7. Afraid to ask to replace food for fear that it would add 15 minutes to already lengthy visit 
8. Couple next to us complained and the waiter told them it's a Monday and holiday so what do they expect 
9. Oh and when we checked in we said inside or outside was fine. They seated people that came after us before us. When husband asked they didn't mark us as inside or outside. 
10. Hardly ever saw waiter on patio unless he was delivering. But never to check on anyone. 

They did however take one of the meals off of our receipt which is why I gave 1 star."}
{"text":"When it first opened I was excited because of the lack of great breakfast places on the west side. Unfortunately Biscuits let me down. We have small kids and we're looking for fast service. Instead the service was slow and when the food was finally brought to our table we were disappointed at how mediocre is all was.
I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Ive gone here for dine in and the food was okay.  But take out is another story!!  The french toast was not fully cooked I mean it was still runny once you cut into it!!! The lady asked me what kind of fruit do you want all strawberries or mixed fruit?? I clearly said mixed but she still gave me all strawberries.  I spent atleast 30 dollars and got horrible quality and not good customer service.  Than!! I went back to just get a cinnamon roll. Oh when I opened the box the cinnamon roll was drenched in frosting I mean like the frosting filled up half the box.  Not good quality at all.  Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Taking far too long to get food. Waited 20 mins to get seated, waited on right away, 1/2 hr for food. The the food was undercooked and cold, after 15 mins still didn't get a replacement. Told our server Jami to cancel my order. BTW...her service was great. I am done with this place, no manager in sight."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and both times the food sucked. No flavor; super bland. Even the potatoes tasted bad. The best part of my meal was the water I ordered. The service was also poor, but at least the workers are nice? ALSO I think they need to update their menu and add some pictures of their signature dishes."}
{"text":"Biscuits gets  2 stars but $$$ for price.
Your meal come complete with sticky table, long wait time (we went  for breakfast)  then an  additional wait time for forgotten food ordered like eggs and toast together. Coffee is bitter lacks flavor and aroma. Substitutions  like berrys instead of hashbrowns is a $2 up charge. Breakfast for 2 cost  was $30.00. Ouch!"}
{"text":"I called in to order for pickup, and I also left a tip saying how the lady who answered my call was very friendly. That's still true. However, everything else from there went downhill.

They told me it would take 20 minutes. I arrive 30 minutes later to find out they forgot to put my order in. Before the manager helped me, a waitress, an older woman with blond hair, was extremely rude and she had a really dirty look. Really, lady? You guys didn't put in my order and you have the nerve to give me an attitude? While I was waiting for my food to be cooked, I heard the phone ring and that same waitress said to her co-worker \"I'm not picking it up, I already took two phone orders.\" Is she kidding me? She works there! And it was a busy Saturday morning.

The manager was really friendly, and told me it'll take a few more minutes because the order wasn't put it in. By that point, especially after dealing with that waitress, the least she could've done was give me something on the house. 

Finally got my food after waiting 30 minutes. When I got home, there was a long and short strand of black hair on my french toast. I was too annoyed and tired to call back and complain about it, and I doubt they would've done anything about it anyway.

My cinnamon roll (no hair, thank god), was gross. Icing tasted bad, cinnamon roll itself was dry.  Bad service, bad food.

I wouldn't come here again, and I feel bad for the manager working there. She seems to really try, but I feel this place is unorganized, and needs some help with customer service."}
{"text":"I always love this place.  The omelets are amazing, pancakes are fluffy, and bacon is crispy...every time!  This is the perfect \"traditional\" meets \"modern\" breakfast spot.
The reason I give this review 4 stars rather than 5 is because I think the prices are a little high.  $40 for breakfast for 3 is pretty high, but we keep coming back.
I would recommend to anyone interested in a hearty portion for breakfast."}
{"text":"Manage Kris runs a tight ship:) this Biscuits cafe is extremely clean,  friendly and comfortable!!! The food is freshly made and feels like mom made it!! Our waitress Nicki was fantastic!!! Very fun, energetic & engaging!!!! If I could give 10 stars I WOULD!!!!"}
{"text":"First time in Biscuits. Decor is fun and farmish. Food was good and plentiful but very pricey for a breakfast joint. Wait staff was friendly and attentive. Overall a nice place. Would give 5 stars if it was about 20% cheaper. $5 dollars for a large Orange juice? $12 for 2 biscuits and some gravy....yikes"}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast here!!! ( Family owned restaurant which gives it a small town type vibe . ) My boyfriend and I were greeted and sat within the first two minutes in the restaurant(which is great considering it was 11am on a busy Sunday morning). We we're immediately greeted by a server who took our drink orders. I ordered a half coffee/ half hot cocoa with whipped cream and it was DELICIOUS . I would go just for that alone any day!! After looking over the entire menu ( so many great choices ), I ordered the 5 Berries waffle combo (2 waffles, scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese, and 4 sausage links) and my boyfriend ordered the chicken waffles (2 waffles and 3 chicken tenders). When the food came out, unfortunately I was already half full from my drink alone. I did try a bite of everything and it all tasted amazing! I had to box mine to go though cuz I was just so full from my mocha. The only problem was they put the berries on top of my waffles which made the soggy after while, so next time I'll request them on the side. My boyfriends breakfast was equally as good as mine if not better! The combination of sweet and salty was amazing  I'll be ordering his next time  will be back again!"}
{"text":"Lots of food, tastes good, decent service.  Good for dining in, or calling in for a to-go.  Despite the saying on their door \"We don't make fast food, we make fresh food as fast as we can,\" they food has always come out quicker than expected.  Seating is in tight quarters, so if that bugs you, you may be a bit overwhelmed."}
{"text":"I drove by this place often when out to lunch with my sister. Thought we'd give it a try. So glad we did. They had a country skillet so I had to get it. It was delicious and the gravy was so yummy! For me and my skillet love it's all about the gravy on top! So good! Of course we both had the biscuits. We were not disappointed they were oh so good! 

My son is still trying steak and eggs were ever we go. He had the chicken fried chicken and thought it was really good. He also thought there breakfast gravy was good. We both had the hash browns potatoes, cooked crispy. Fresh squeezed oj was good. I don't drink coffee but my son does and he said it was good. Nice big cup.  We will definitely have to come back."}
{"text":"The place to go in Tempe for breakfast! Came to town for Pats Run and went all 4 mornings, getting something different every time. Sweet potato pancakes are my favorite but it was all delicious and a large selection.. and a ton of food for the price, other places in town charge twice as much for a third the amount of food! 

Plus, they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with every meal! Yum. We'll be back next year!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning about 10am. It was clearly busier than the staff and kitchen crew are able to handle. The place was packed but the tables were not full. It took a while to order and then the order was not correct when it came to the table. The appetizer cinnamon roll never came, my drink was not refilled and my pancake was burnt (black). The hash browns needed some love and my french toast seemed old. I hope they get their act together, it has the right ingredients to make it happen."}
{"text":"Another email came this morning telling me I had $5 reward waiting for me at Biscuits...this is the second time I got that email since the Las Vegas Biscuits closed....A few weeks ago I drove there, hungry, full of anticipation,  to find a hand-written sign on the entry door saying closed permanently...What?  No warning for  the best place to get a BLT with lean, meaty \"B\"!?   Like reviewer Anne I also favored the pot roast soup...My email to the Arizona Biscuits Cafe went unanswered--I wanted to know if another Las Vegas Location was going to happen-so sad..my 5 - star rating must drop to 1 for owners' failing to give us notice so we could use our reward points prior to closing."}
{"text":"Can't rate the food here as the service or lack of service forced us to leave. Apparently going on a non weekend day and not being a regular impacts your ability to be served. Also I apparently did a big no no by bringing in the last of my iced Starbucks (sorry my bad), and because I ordered water (fyi I don't drink coffee), my starbucks was an iced chai. But instead of advising me I couldn't bring my drink in (which I would have been fine with) they stand behind our booth and talk about me, my starbucks and my water request.  BTW, I finished my chai within 3 mins of entering. We waited 15 more minutes for someone to come and take our order (never happened). Wow immature much, thanks but no thanks. We left and went to BLD."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service, great atmosphere, locally owned and big PORTIONS! This will definitely be a space I'll be regularly coming too..."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place as I like this type of fare!  

Ordered the breakfast veggie wrap and iced latte. Food came out quickly with generous sized portions for all three of us and looked great when served, but maybe we expected more because nothing really blew us away. 

In fact,  the bottom of the wrap was soggy - maybe veggies were not drained enough after steaming?  Grilled veggies would give this some flavor as it was pretty bland as well. I couldn't eat it but didn't let staff know...I might have if someone had come around to see how it all turned out. A gentleman came by about 1 minute after we got our food... of course everything is fine then!

The mark of a good restaurant is when the manager asks how the meal WAS. It's the only way to get the valuable feedback needed to know how the food is actually coming out of the kitchen. 

Friend said her French toast was delish, but could taste a hint of onion like a spatula was shared at the grill. She and I both received our lattes well into our meals and only after asking for them when food arrived. Server was polite and apologetic but might have done something like made them a large to show appreciation for our patience.

I still want to like this place, so plan to go back and try a different item and chalk this meal up as a one-off disappointment... that's possible, right? 

Would be happy to edit this review after my next experience... hopefully for the good!"}
{"text":"I tell ya, I've eaten here twice and will go back, but it's been interesting each time.  Most of the \"interesting\" vibe centers around the servers.  

The first time, Mr. M and I both had regular bacon and egg breakfasts with an added order of B & G.  The place is named Biscuits for God's sake, so we must try the B.  

The bacon is spectacular.  It was cooked perfectly and tasted and smelled how a BBQ smokehouse does.  Loved that.  Everything else was fine, except for the B & G.  It must have been an exception, because other reviewers have raved about it, but ours had 2 hard, dry biscuits.  No amount of gravy is going to soften those up in the 2 minutes it's at our table.  And speaking of the gravy, I could taste an overwhelming floury, pasty flavor and texture to the gravy.  My guess is someone was over-baked themselves that morning and made a thin batch of gravy and then went overboard with the flour or cornstarch or roux or whatever they use to thicken it.   I'm chalking that up as a fluke and will try those again.  

Our server on the first visit was just straight up weird.  She acted like she didn't want to get too close to the table and would stand behind my left shoulder to talk to us, then would hustle away after we gave our orders.  Very strange.  

The second time was a great visit overall, other than our server, Richard.  We were the only table seated outside at that time and it was a lovely sunny morning just before the heat ratcheted up.   When Richard greeted us he was very friendly and all smiles.  He took our order and that's the last we saw of him until it was check time.  

They give you very teeny water glasses and those were empty in no time.  I also had a café mocha and that was very tasty and pretty as well.  I would definitely have that again.  The lack of water refills was annoying, but if I get annoyed enough I'll get up and go ask for more.   

The avocado benedict was absolutely perfect.  The English muffin was toasted and then the eggs were cooked about medium.  Runny yolk, but not watery.  And the avocado was fresh, creamy deliciousness.   Fresh tomatoes as well that tasted like they were from the garden.  That meal was so good I'm going to have a hard time trying something else when I go back.  

Mr. M got a regular bacon and egg breakfast but added a pancake so we could give that a try.  Everything he ordered was delicious as well.  We were eating kind of slowly for a change and just enjoying the morning and the weather when a busboy came on out and didn't say a word, but reached over us to attempt to grab the plate with a half-eaten pancake. 

Oh no.  Oh no.  You do not want to risk losing a digit by doing that.  I was kind of shocked he didn't say a word, and I politely informed him we weren't finished yet.  I asked for more water, but never got it.

Ten minutes later here comes long-lost Richard, all smiles, presenting us with the check and thanking us profusely for coming in....laying it on pretty thick.

Richard, do you think I was born yesterday?  Your performance today earned you about a 12% tip, maybe less if I wasn't in such a good mood.  Servers should always come back and check about 2 minutes after the food has been dropped, and then about 10-15 minutes later and have their eyes open for drink refills.  At a minimum.  I learned it and lived it.  You can too."}
{"text":"This is probably not my favorite breakfast place. But they have good food. I got the biscuits omelette! And for drink I had water and apple juice I like this breakfast place and will be coming back."}
{"text":"We came after the lunch crowd and this being my first time here I had to ask the others what is good to eat. I decided to order the Almond Crusted French Toast. It was good, came with two eggs, and you are given a choice of ham, bacon or sausage. I elected to go with the sausage. It was somewhat good and it was more than enough. I will give this a three star only because it is more of a breakfast place than a lunch place. I would say it would be a great breakfast place in the morning. Service was great as an added bonus."}
{"text":"Sinceriously welcoming and food to par.

my husband and i started the morning with some bad news, so we needed something comforting. we saw Biscuits Cafe near our home, and upon entering, the staff was very welcoming. 

we both had the biscuits cornedbeef hash \"made from scratch.\" And yes, definately wholesome and made from scatch. We had the mini biscuits with our plate, and it was as a bicuit should taste like--utterly comforting. but what blew us away was the fresh house jam served with the biscuit. That closed the deal. the restaurant is HUGE, so waiting on a saturday morning at 8:30 was minimal. our food came out swiftly. the server asked if we needed anything, and as i looked at our table, it was complete with all the inclusions such as ketchup in its glass bottle, a variety of tabasco sauce, including smoked tabasco. perfect.

it's peaceful and we enjoyed even the outstanding chemistry of the entire staff."}
{"text":"The first time I came I got a free giant cookie with my meal and this time I got free chocolate covered strawberries! The food is great and service is great too!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast! Even with it always being crowded, they are still attentive with friendly service. Food is delicious and filling.  They also have cute merchandise I.e love their deep coffee cups."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing! The service was wonderful and the food came out awesome!!!! Highly recommend eating here anytime of the day!"}
{"text":"This was the most amazing breakfast ever! I had the corned beef hash made from scratch and cannot wait to go back. Their jams are to die for and biscuits melt in your mouth! Homemade bread. Service was superb. Atmosphere welcoming."}
{"text":"Hello here to tell you, YOU GUYS SUCK! Customer service wise at least. The food is alright, but I honestly got better cooked food the first time we came. The French toast was kinda rushed you could tell because it wasn't cooked all the way through. If we came in looking like we had money, I'm sure they wouldn't have sat us at a dirty table at the very back of the restaurant.. right next to the bathrooms lol. Thanks, but no thanks. I'd rather make the same thing at home without feeling like a peasant"}
{"text":"This is right by my house and is my favorite local breakfast spot.  The food is great the staff is great.  They have homemade strawberry jam for their great biscuits.  Give it a try and you'll be happy about it."}
{"text":"There are so many breakfast spots in Las Vegas that it can be hard to choose one...

My girlfriend told me about a place called Biscuits Cafe after she saw it on Yelp. We made a mistake and tried it out.

We were one of the few tables that actually had customers, and yet drink and ordering times were slightly ridiculous. On top of that, our table was dirty when we sat down. We asked the waitress to clean it and she did (half-assedly) as it remained dirty. When she left and did not come back for 20 minutes, we asked the bus boy if he could clean it. He did (half-assedly) as it still remained dirty. We eventually received our food. I think I had french toast and eggs of some sort. It didn't really matter, because it was plain, tasteless and just not very memorable. 

The coffee was good, i guess.

We ate our food, paid and left, hopefully never to return."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast for a good price, the breakfast tacos are very good but the homemade jelly will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this cafe.  I had biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon.  My friend had Eggs Benedict and it looked great and she said it was wonderful.  I will sure be going back know my husband would love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food jam is awesome! Our server alissa  was great! We will be back. place is clean!"}
{"text":"I go here for breakfast once a week (usually on a weekend) with my boyfriend. We started going here just because it wasn't as crowded as other breakfast places. Waiting for a table at a restaurant is the bane of existence, I would rather just leave and eat somewhere else 99% of the time. Also, I always want a booth because I hate sitting at tables- and this place almost always has a booth for me. The food for the first few weeks was just average, decent breakfast food. Then about two weeks ago we tried the bacon breakfast tacos. Pretty good!! They are seriously simple, but so delicious. Try them if you ever go here!

There are a few things I would like to see changed. 
1) I always order a coffee and a water, and my water comes in this dinky little blue plastic \"childrens\" looking cup. This has always been surprising to me because it is not like I am ordering water in place of buying a drink. I am buying a drink too, so give me a real water. It bothers me every time, I just can't figure out why the policy would be to give people who want water and coffee a shot of water. I want a real cup with a lemon!

2) It is always really bright. I think some kind of window coverings would be nice, maybe just some see through screens to dim it mildly. Sometimes I wear my sunglasses inside this place. 

3) I think some people who work there are confused about their rewards system. The first person who explained it to me said that rewards you earn with points don't expire. This makes sense, because it's basically a \"spend X get X free\" system. Then the other day we went in and had a birthday reward and a points reward, and the girl told us we should use the points reward because it expires. In actuality, the birthday reward should be the one that expires as it is only good for the month that it is your birthday - which was ending soon. If I had used the points reward like she wanted me to, I would have lost the birthday reward all together. As far as I am aware right now, points rewards don't expire. I could be wrong- but I would hope they would put it in an email or something if they do expire so we know when. Either I have to be reeducated or someone on the staff does. I don't really care which of us is wrong but I don't like the confusion."}
{"text":"Way over priced will not be back! Service and atmosphere was good. Three of us had lunch and were not impressed. Taco salad is $11.69 and I get a bigger salad at McDonald's! Coffee $2.69 is way to much! Cafe just opened in San Tan Valley Arizona! Good luck stay open with those prices."}
{"text":"The foo was tasty. The atmosphere gets kind of loud but that's okay. Staff is friendly. Food consistently takes forever and is pricy. Almost $5 for a small smoothie. When busy there isn't much room to wait inside so you're forced to sit outside in the Arizona heat. Not a bad experience but time management needs improvement. Maybe they are understaffed? Also the parking situation is terrible since its tiny ad is shared with a building with multiple businesses"}
{"text":"Went there today and had breakfast, first off noticed prices were higher than normal but later decided it was because the portion size is large! Hubby had the kielbasa eggs, biscuits and hash browns! He cleaned his plate! I on the other hand had a country omelette with gravy on the side, hash browns and pancakes! It did not come with gravy on side but was pleased it was remade quickly! I did not like the gravy so was happy I got it on the side! I did not like the sausage they put in the omelette! The pancakes were large so really it was to much for me to eat! People who came in after us were waited on before us, our waitress seemed to be a lot more busy than others around us!!!  All in all not a bad place to eat, but I've had better! Not sure we will return, those metal seats don't look to comfortable! We were lucky to get a booth!"}
{"text":"Not too many people here yet I was seated and waited for more than 10 minutes before I walked...I was given water but no one seemed interested in taking my breakfast order. Service is lacking greatly, no communication or acknowledgement to me that they would take my order 
Disappointed and hungry...."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, open floor plan, and great scrambles! 
The biscuits and tortillas tasted fresh and maybe home-made. The scrambles used fresh food & produce cooked just right. Definitely 4-star food plus a little. 
The hash browns were pretty bland and maybe underdone. That was about the only negative item."}
{"text":"Very delicious. You can tell everything is fresh! My fiancé & I split the California Club and it was very good. We also split a salad that came with a biscuit with this out of this world Jam. Coffee mugs are very large & I love it! Very happy experience."}
{"text":"Service was bad at the McClintock & Elliot Rd location. Waiter was in a rush and got our orders wrong. Bacon was to greasy Hash browns was crispy burnt. Country potatoes had broken eggs shells."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went for a morning date and were very impressed.  Very friendly staff.  We're super picky about biscuits and gravy, since I make a family recipe that is bomb, but their biscuits and gravy were pretty good.  Good vibes.  Great atmosphere.  Friendly service.  Not overly priced.  Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Why are people down on Biscuits, this place is serving up killer breakfast with fast service times and a good price.  Hashbrowns, eggs, pancakes, french toast. chicken fried steak, and of course biscuits and gravy they have it all!  This is definitely my new go-to breakfast joint in the area, especially since the seating is much more comfortable than what they have at waffle house."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this gem almost on accident. The fiancé and I were debating where to go for breakfast, took a wrong turn (or two) and found the Biscuits Cafe. I loved biscuits so I was sold on the name alone!

Everyone there was friendly and attentive. It seems like a place people come back to and where they get to know your name. I ordered the chicken apple sausage and the fiancé ordered the kielbasa. Both were delicious. They came with red potatoes and biscuits. The potatoes were well seasoned and a good crispness. The biscuits were great on their own but the butter and jam put them over the top. I wish I had some with me right now..."}
{"text":"This is one of the most disappointing restaurants. I have been here several times, and it is never a good experience, however this last visit prompted my review.  We were seated outside, which would have been fine if we had seen our server regularly (We did not). I had to go inside to ask for more water and coffee while we waited for our food. Coffee was served with lipstick on the mug and a hair in the coffee mug. The food was OK. After we ate, my plate was never picked up, and while we finished our conversation with our friends, we were never offered more coffee or water. The waiter dropped our bill on the table and we never saw her again. Don't come here! There are other places not too far away!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't waste time; they get your food out to you fast! I think this place has the best Country Benny (benedict) in Las Vegas. 

Their cinnamon roll lacks sugar or cinnamon flavor, so it's a little disappointing, but only $3.99! Their sausage is thick and tastes fresh from the farm, which is truly what makes their Benny so yum. Their entree portions are huge and potato sides are equally large.

Still not THE place for breakfast, but I'll be back again for biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Me and my husband came here Saturday morning because Jamms was too busy and we are so happy we did.

I ordered the meat lovers scramble and my husband ordered the southwest scramble. Both of us loved our meal, they do have big servings so be sure to have a apatite when you come here. Their biscuits were great and the chorizo was good quality and they weren't stingey with the chorizo either. 

Also our servers were very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be returning here for breakfast again. It won't be long before this place will be constantly packed."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  I had the breakfast tacos which were delicious and very filling. I needed a nap after I ate them.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I thought they had fantastic food but a little pricey. I would definitely go again I had the chicken fried chicken the gym was out of this world biscuits were fresh it was just all-around fantastic experience there"}
{"text":"We prefer this location to the one on Alma School..patio seating is much better. Food is usually very good. My only complaint is they don't clean the outside tables well, if we go there for breakfast we usually have to ask them to wipe off the table and chairs . That should be a job for someone when the restaurant opens, especially now that the weather is getting nicer."}
{"text":"I only went there one time and that was more than enough for me.  This place used to be a cici's pizza a dozen did not remodel much. Open kitchen which felt weird to me.  They had a soda machine if the middle of the restaurant not in the back.  The service was fast and friendly. Food came fast but the quality was not great the Bacon was chewy almost like it was sitting under a heat lamp. I love biscuits and gravy but good lord what they gave me was an abomination.   The gravy was decent but loaded with oregano?  That's pretty odd.  And the biscuit tasted like flour and water.  It honestly tasted like the \"bread\" from the military mre's.   No bueno"}
{"text":"We love this place! Amazing service, delicious food,  large portions and a great rewards program (so easy too, just an email address!)"}
{"text":"Had the brisket sandwich. Dont know what kind of meat they served but it didnt taste or look like brisket, had a very strange taste."}
{"text":"My husband mom and I just left there from lunch, we didn't even get drinks. We were sat in a corner with our menus, and the hostess left never telling us who are server was. We were sitting there for over 8 minutes and watched other people get silverware and drinks who arrived after us. We had our whole meal planned out when we decided it was time to leave empty handed, a waitress made eye contact with us and completely ignored that we were leaving with out being waited on at all, instead she turned away from us to greet a new costumer and to wait on them instead. It wasn't until I said we were leaving because the lack of wait staff did she actually acknowledge us, saying that they would do something for us. But by that time it was too late to rectify the situation and we walked to a different resturant where we were almost instantly waited on."}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to get in here.  The salads are ENORMOUS!  We actually both ate from the salad and had enough to have the next day!  Good prices, too.  A keeper, for sure!"}
{"text":"Another weekday breakfast visit to Biscuits Cafe. I basically ordered the same as last visit, for $10 plus tax and tip. 

My server greeted me quickly and was pleasant. There were eight full tables this time, about 1/5 full at 9 AM on a Wednesday. They played soft rock from the 80's. 

My breakfast arrived in 12 mins again. I guess that was their standard turn time.  My biscuit was small again but smothered in gravy, light and fluffy. 

The Hash Browns were a little greasy. They could've used more sear to help with that. 

The Sausage Links were pretty standard but had a good sear, which provided good snap. 

After further review, I concluded that they were not affiliated with the various 'Biscuits' around the east valley. Hence the difference in biscuit size. 

Service definitely improved. 

Update: I came back a month later. 10 AM on a Thursday and only five full tables but summer was coming so the students and snow birds were fleeing. 

I ordered the Corned Beef Hash, which came with eggs, potatoes and toast. I opted for hash browns and biscuits. All that for $11. Not bad. 

My breakfast arrived in seven mins. Go figure. 

The corned beef hash wasn't really hash. It was grilled potatoes covered with shredded corned beef. A little tough to eat because of the long shreds but it was good tho. 

The biscuits were very small, about 2-3\" across but were fluffy and light. They came with a crock of whipped butter and a crock of jam. 

The hash browns were crispy and plentiful."}
{"text":"Ordered the keep it simple breakfast. Eggs scrambled, crisp bacon, hot syrup and extra butter. Had to ask twice for extra butter and syrup. Bacon was hardly cooked and pancakes were cold. Elizabeth was our server and she was pleasant and tended to our needs. The employee that was delivering food spent more time talking to other staff members than taking care of business."}
{"text":"Lunch was OK, not great.  Caution, check your credit card statements,  2 persons for lunch, bill was around 20-22 dollars.  Received credit card statement, Visa statement was $44.78 for a 2 person lunch & only water to drink.  Something fishy happened after we left restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"It might not be fair to write this review, because I've had such a limited sampling of the menu - - I get the same thing just about every time I go in, but what I do get is really good. Turkey and Veggie Scramble with fruit and pancakes. Everything is delicious. The pancakes are incredibly moist and have a sweet, subtle taste  that almost seems citrusy. I was not quite as thrilled with the potatoes. I don't like anything well-done, but even for me, these were kind of on the raw side. 

Typical boring restaurant interior, but they do have outdoor seating, which is always nice. Service is usually good to very good. I can't say that the servers are amazing, nor can I offer any complaints.

Overall, my favorite breakfast place in the area."}
{"text":"So Far the ONLY thing I didn't like was the Huevos Ranchero it didn't taste anything like any kind of huevos rancheros I ever had it was more like enchilada sauce this needs to be improved on
Besides that I love the place"}
{"text":"THE FOOD AND SERVICE ARE FANTASTIC!  We had a server named Preston. I tipped that wonderful young man almost 50%! and he deserved even more than that! On Saturday & Sunday they are very busy. Every table was occupied; however our waiter, Preston, never missed refilling our coffee and water as soon as we drank a little and checked to see if we needed anything. 
BEST COFFEE in town! 
We went on a Saturday morning and enjoyed it so much, we went back on Sunday!
The prices aren't the cheapest in town, but no where near as much as one would expect to pay for the quality of the food and service!
The portions are very large! On both visits, my sister and I shared a breakfast and it was definitely enough to satisfy!
I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for great food, great service and great value!"}
{"text":"We went with 4 adults 2 kids on a Saturday about 12:30. We were seated promptly and the staff was very friendly. We preferred our food and shortly thereafter the food started to come out. We received 3 meals and no silverware. We had to ask several times before they brought some to us. Our next order that came was not correct, so they took them back and came back wrong once again. My order of a California Chicken Burger came but was sliced turkey and by the time they brought me my food everyone else was done. However, I will tell you that our waitress did as much as she could possibly do to make it right. The manager delivered my food and apologized for the mix up as well as comped that meal for us. I am glad I waited for the correct order because it was delicious. I will definitely go back and order that again. Hopefully they will be able to deliver on all accounts."}
{"text":"In town visiting for a few days and my Mom was excited to have us try out the \"new spot\" in town. I'm not sure how people aren't a fan of the coffee - I thought it was amazing and was talked into having it after hearing the rave reviews about it. Apparently it's their own bean and they sell it (along with mugs, granola, and some other goodies) at the front of the restaurant. 

Amber was our server and she was super friendly and patient with us. We had to do some plate shuffling to keep out of my little one's reach and she helped hold food and plates for me until we got organized. I was trying to be quick and she kept telling me to take my time and not to worry! My husband had to meet us there 15 minutes after us to finish up some work but we were able to order food for the baby and read up on the menu in the mean time. They have clean high chairs (although, strangely they're on wheels) and just a random note to parents - they don't have whole milk. I almost randomly brought some from home but didn't...so we had to settle for 2%. I told her what I was debating getting him for lunch and she told me that a la carte would be cheaper than ordering off of the kids menu. Everyone had breakfast except for me - I had the California Club - which was decent; my only gripe is that bun was a bit too bready and yet at the same time not long enough (or cut evenly enough) for everything to fit on there. My turkey was authentic fresh carved deli meat - not the usual processed stuff you'd generally get from most places.  It was a lot of food so the other half came home with me; along with half of the scrambled egg and strawberries for my 1 year old. 

My Mom's husband said his eggs were a bit overcooked this time around and my husband said his hashbrowns were a bit under cooked but my mom's omelette and the rest of the food was good. I don't live here so I won't be frequenting the place but I'd certainly come back and I'm sure when I visit we will come by again. I didn't see the bill so I can't comment on the price, however it did seem like a lot of their items are super fresh and wholesome."}
{"text":"We have been twice so far and have enjoyed it both times. Overall, the food is pretty good. Service is friendly and consistent.  Both times though, I've had a soup/sandwich or soup/salad combo and they forget the cornbread every single time. It's a nice place and a good replacement for NYF since they closed. :( Biscuits is definitely a worthy visit."}
{"text":"My experience definitely did not match the negative reviews I read!

I came on Saturday around 12:30 for brunch.  At first I thought it was a pet store, due to the misleading name and sign, but I managed to figure out the truth.  

I like to take myself out to a leisurely brunch on occasion and people watch or read.  Many people think it's strange for a perfectly normal (and amazingly attractive and delightful, I might add) girl to enjoy going out alone, but to that I say Hey! Don't judge me.  

There were plenty of tables, and I didn't have to wait at all.  I took my time perusing the menu, because it's actually pretty extensive.  They had a full breakfast and lunch selection.  

I picked Sweet Potato Pancakes because I didn't know if they'd be pancakes with a sweet potato vibe or if they'd be more like your latke-style potato pancake, and I like to take risks.  (Spoiler alert: They were the former)  The pancakes were good, nice flavor, the sausage was awesome (I rarely get sausage, so I hate being disappointed when I do), and I got my eggs poached.  I appreciate poached eggs a lot so I wouldn't complain, but I prefer them poached easy, and these came poached hard.  Still, I didn't specify when I ordered and the girl didn't ask.  Also, being a New England native, I don't have much respect for faux maple syrup.  That's a personal problem though, not the fault of Biscuits.

They have acceptable coffee- darker and weaker than I like it, but if you're a Starbucks fan (I am not) it's a lot like that.  

The place was clean, the service was great, I sat there and read my book for a long time and no one bothered me, nor did I feel any pressure to get the heck out and stop loitering.  

The ambiance is a little... corporate.  But so is just about every restaurant on this side of Phoenix.  They could benefit from an extra wall or two, and some more creative seating options (booths, big tables, couches- I love that stuff).  The other complaint I have is one I have about most restaurants in Phoenix- there really aren't any options under $10.  I'm not saying they need to take down the price of their whole menu, but I believe by principle one should be able to order coffee and an egg sandwich or something the average obese American might not be satisfied with and cover the whole thing with a Ten.  Nothing fancy, but something for us poorer or less hungry folk.

If this restaurant were in my hometown of Deliciousfoodville, Massachusetts, I'd give it 3 stars.  Because it's in Glendale, where my standards are so much lower it gets 4.  I'll definitely be back.  It's better than The Good Egg or Wildflower."}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast this morning and were glad to see a new place near our home. Mgr came over to say hello and staff were all very friendly. Place is big and VERY clean.
We shared a Joe's scramble and had left overs for our dog. Great coffee too
Hope they do well"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lot of areas for improvement. 

When I first walked in, it took me a good ten minutes to be put on the waitlist due to the fact that there was only one poor girl running the entire front. She was ringing people out and adding others to the list. I could see several empty tables, but there was no one to seat people. So. Badly managed. 

When we we seated, our waitress came over and introduced herself, then walked away. While she was gone, I examined my silverware and it was filthy. She finally came back with waters and took our orders. However, the waitress must have set her order book in a puddle or something - while she was flipping it around, I practically got a free shower (minus the loofa).

Took a while to get our food, but it was mostly tasty. Nothing too memorable, nothing that left me wanting more. My son, a notoriously picky eater, ate most of his plate, so obviously it wasn't *gross*. Chef needs to learn the difference between over easy and over medium, but that's common of most breakfast joints, now that I think about it. 

I would probably go back if I actually lived in Arizona. But since I don't, I will save my limited, breakfast-in-Arizona, needs for the far superior Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"First time eating at Biscuits Cafe and chose breakfast.  Lots of menu choices for everyone but not for every budget level.  A pick 3 for $8.99 appears to be a hearty amount of food but some will find it's too much food and outside their budget range.  Recommendation: split a plate as there is enough for two people to share a breakfast.  Lunch and Dinner menu items appear comparably priced to Red Robin.  

We had the chicken fried steak / eggs / hashbrowns / toast and the chicken-apple sausage / eggs / hashbrowns / pancakes.  

Food was hot and flavorful.  A lot of food, the carb based items were a majority as would be expected (potatoes, bread and pancakes).  Meat was good portion sized as well.  Homemade freezer jam is delish and went well spread on the pancakes!!  Sourdough didn't taste like sourdough.  

Server was friendly and attentive enough.  

-2 for dirty silverware.  First two knives in the silverware rolls were dirty.  Received 2 more rolls and one of those knives were dirty.  Not smudges but pieces of food stuck to the knives."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!! This was such a delicious place for Breakfast! FOOD: was amazing, every dish we had in our group of 5 was delicious; the Eggs Benedict and the Cinnamon French Toast were my favorite! The pancakes were so good too.. made with real butter milk and you can definitely taste that from the first bite. Their biscuits and gravy were just perfect too! SERVICE: super friendly hostess and waitress. Can't wait to go back! XOXO I also love the large portions... ; )"}
{"text":"I have stopped minors times at a local place called Biscuits.  This restaurant with a similar name was a first visit for me.  It is not associated with the other restaurant. This place was clean bright and had a basic menu of breakfast and lunch items. I found the food to be good but not exceptional. I had a Rueben sandwich with potato salad. Bother we're good and the potato salad was very well done. The portions were more that adequate since I had to take half of my meal home. Prices were average and within the value ranges. My wife had the eggs and bacon. She thought the bacon was very good and the eggs done to her liking. The only negative was the service. Not overly slow, but, our server lacked some personality which would have made the experience more enjoyable. Maybe he was having a bad day. Not bad enough not to give him my usual 20% tip. 
It is a good place to have a reasonable meal. Compared to the other Biscuits restaurant this place is only a 3 star. ( Read my review of the other Biscuits )."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Rickety tables and chairs. Bacon was burnt and the biscuits and gravy were stale. Disappointing due to the fact they are named after them. The waitress didn't check on us once and wasn't even the one to bring the food out. Overpriced as well"}
{"text":"Went there today sign on the door so there permanently closed. Sad to see they're closed since we enjoyed many meals there and sure that they are locally owned."}
{"text":"Nice, clean restaurant. I ordered the veggie head omelette. It wasn't that good, they didn't grill the veggies enough in my opinion. I forgot that there was cream cheese and avacadoes in it because you didn't get any of it until you got to the very center. I will go back but will definitely be ordering something else"}
{"text":"I have to disagree with a lot of these reviews.  First it was nice to barely wait on a Sunday.  We were seated almost immediately.  I ordered corned beef and potatoes and biscuits.  So good, the jellies that come with biscuits were delicious.  The menu has a good mix of choices."}
{"text":"This place is slipping! Some of the food was overcooked and undercooked at the same time. We order the corned beef hash and it was stringy, dried out  and overcooked. The waffles were great, nice and fluffy but crispy outside. The coffee is total rubbish. It kind of taste like the cheap Motel 8 coffee, just horrible! No flavor and flat for days. For the most part the food was tasty and the place was clean and staff friendly. I am a coffee person so I am sure I won't be back, but if you can get past bad coffee then you should try it!"}
{"text":"What has happened to this charming little breakfast spot?  Is it under new management or something? We've been here several times in the past and always had great service, delicious food and lots of options. So very disappointing today.  The menu appeared to have far fewer options, our food took forever to come out and when it finally arrived, it was cold.  Our waitress seemed to be covering more tables than she could handle effectively, so service was lacking, but I think she was doing the best she could.  She never informed the manager that our food was cold and when we paid, since he didn't care to ask how everything was, I went ahead and told him.  He gave a feeble apology and sent us on our way.  I can't imagine why we would ever go back."}
{"text":"Fist time here came to meet my friend for breakfast. As usual I was here first and started with coffee. It was hot and really good.  After my friend came our waitress was really wonderful and didn't push us to order right away. A girls got to catch up doesn't she?  The food was outstanding. Large portions, I couldn't finish my French toast.  Please forgive me I forgot out waitress name, but she kept the coffee coming never had to be asked.  Will I go back.  I did already and this time took my husband and daughter."}
{"text":"Still as delicious as ever!  Of course it is very busy today as its New Years day, but the food and service is great!"}
{"text":"The food was good but we were disappointed that the biscuits seemed rather small and average for a restaurant named Biscuits.  The hollandaise sauce was also good but nothing we would crave.  I did love the raspberry jam, but, as mentioned before, would've preferred more biscuit to put it on.  Our server was very pleasant."}
{"text":"I showed up at Biscuits Cafe with my wife and toddler five minutes before they closed on a Sunday. They were gracious in allowing me to sit and eat. They served me quickly and attentively and the food was awesome. The Ruben was amazing. Definitely a new favorite."}
{"text":"A nice breakfast joint breaking away from the usual chains I frequent, whether actually for breakfast or after leaving a bar, this place was refreshing. I got the biscuits and gravy and was actually pleased with my choice thinking it was going to be like any other B&G I've had a hundred times before. If I ever finally become a bonafide morning person I'll probably pop by a few more times to try a few other dishes."}
{"text":"Canned Chili Really? There was four use, we all decided to have chili.  Big mistake!  Not only was it canned chili it was not hot.  We sent it back to be heated and it only came warm.  I spent $41 on canned chili."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out so I was anxious to give this place a try even though I had to drive from Buckeye to Glendale to give it a try.  

My first impression was this - pricey!  Very pricey.  But that's okay i guess if the food is exceptional but it wasn't exceptional.  It was good but not really anything to brag about.  I had the Zesty Chorizo omelet which was good but not really \"Zesty\".  They should call it just a Chorizo omelet and let it go at that.  I like the ability to be able to substitute my toast for a couple of pancakes and the pancakes were really light and fluffy.  Go ahead and ask for extra syrup right away because you will need it - for two large pancakes you will get a about 1 oz instead of a decanter of syrup like most other breakfast joints.  

The wife had 2 scrambled eggs, red potatoes and turkey sausage.  She didn't eat the sausage - too much gristle.  She was not very impressed.

It seems that this place doesn't believe in air conditioning either - it was HOT in this place (Arizona in the summer and NO A/C) and when we mentioned the lack of A/C to the hostess, she said they were going to get that fixed the next day!  Wow, as uncomfortable as it was for the customer, imagine how unbearable it was for the cooks!  

But the one thing that would have me giving this place a thumbs down is that it's not very senior citizen friendly.  At the bottom of the menu in fine print is the notice that \"Split orders 2.50 per plate\" so when I ask for a plate to share one of my two pancakes with the wife, I got slapped with an extra $2.50!  REALLY?  Hell, she could have had her own order for of pancakes for $2.50!!!!

Would I come back.  Probably not - it's expensive, very uncomfortable ambience (no A/C) and $2.50 just to have a waiter bring you an extra empty plate."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch, very busy & great 1st Visit! Food was tasty with generous portions. Staff was cheerful, attentive & our server, Jamie, gave great info to us newbys. Belgian waffles, eggs, omelets, bacon, hash browns & biscuits for our table were all hits. Bonus: Coffee was good too! This location has turned over a couple times, hope this one lasts, I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, ok food, waitress was ok. Food did not agree with my stomach at all. We were double charged. Nothing on the menu was less that $12. Prices use to be so much more affordable. Most likely will not return anytime soon. Time for us to find a more affordable alternative."}
{"text":"Nice and new looking.  Ordered a cinnamon roll and fish n chips combo.  The combo came with fries, Cole slaw, toast and a cup of clam chowder but we substituted pot roast soup.  Our server was polite and pleasant and the food came out quickly. 

The cinnamon roll was decent...it was warm but a bit dry.   The fish was hot, crispy and nicely seasoned.  The fries were average and toast was good.   Cole slaw was horrible not good flavor and tasted stale.  The pot roast soup looked and tasted like Campbells Chunky soup. 

I was hoping to find a good restaurant but it was very mediocre. Seems a bit pricey also."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable process and great service!!!  Vikki was awesome!!! :-)"}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast and immediately liked the décor, sort of modern with interesting design and good use of colors...the way it works, you walk up and order your food and they bring it to the table. I had the usual bacon and 3 eggs with sourdough toast. the eggs were done easy over and they were cooked to perfection..With the toast they included some fresh strawberry jam which was delicious and the home made bread was a great touch.. Another nice touch they also do, is they included a chocolate dipped strawberry with your  meal...I liked that. My  wife had eggs and turkey bacon. She thought they did a great job cooking the eggs....I highly recommend this place, its very clean, the wait help was very friendly and the food and biscuits were to die for....

.Oh wait.... we had the fresh baked Cinnamon roll..Oh my...they glazed it just before they brought it to the table..it smelled increditble and tasted awesome....."}
{"text":"This location is right by a LA fitness, so the setup of the restaurant is kind of awkward. There are tables outside on what would be considered a patio, but it isn't really a patio as much as it is the front of the building. So when you're eating outside, everyone who is waiting for a table is in the same area as you and gets to watch you as you eat. Our server only dealt with us when she took our food order and dropped off the check. Someone else brought our drinks, food, and to -go boxes. My boyfriends french toast was dry and my eggs were ice cold. Luckily my pumpkin pancakes were excellent.  We could have sent them back, but it took us over 20 minutes to get our food and we never could find our server, so we just ate what we had. Pretty sure it isn't worth visiting again."}
{"text":"Went here for a late breakfast and the food was great. We had 5 adults and two kids and they sat us quickly and food came in a short amount of time. All was delicious. French toast cinnamon roll was a unique choice."}
{"text":"Big  menu, tons of options. The service was prompt and very reasonable prices, once of the good breakfast places in town. 

Came here with a large party of 8 and they helped accommodate us very well by pushing a few tables together. They didn't screw up thr order and knew who order what when the food came. 

Convenient location close to the Lakes area, just east of Durango on Sahara. Easy to get to from Summerlin Parkway and Rainbow."}
{"text":"Food was good but they need to to get some  waiters that give a  damn , rude and don't care much about your food.. the one on Alma School is so much better!!!"}
{"text":"Who would ruin gravy over biscuits by putting Italian seasoning in it? Yuck. 
Sausage links juicy, large, good. Red potatoes are almost mashed, very oily. Hash browns raw in middle. Eggs not over medium, but over easy. I'm very disappointed. As well as shocked that a glass of orange juice costs $4.00 for a small. Wow. I could get a margarita for that at happy hour. 
Biscuits hard on bottom as if they have been microwaved. Gravy horrible. Yuck. 
Not coming back."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place, nice employees and food comes out right away! The pancakes here are delish  and very clean and nicely set up :)"}
{"text":"Wasn't busy at all on a Tuesday morning. 1 biscuit/gravy combo was more than enough food. Biscuit was small & dense, but gravy flavorful. Hash browns under seasoned, but allowed me to control and add. Eggs cooked as ordered. Mix/match combo of choco chip pancake eggs bacon also enough for wife & kid. Coffee ok too. Overall good value for price."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this was a counter service breakfast place.

We arrived when they opened and the staff was very friendly.  The fresh brewed tea was made and waiting for me to serve myself.

I tried the biscuits and gravy and they were good.

My daughter had an order of 2 pancakes.  They were huge and looked amazing.  One would have been plenty for a normal sized eater!  And much cheaper to order two then the menu listing of 3.

I want to go back and try the chicken friend steak."}
{"text":"I came to this location several times when it was a coffee shop. At that time the decor was wonderful but the people were emotionless assholes and the prices were too high.

Breakfast food is my favorite and I have seen this place several times. No clue when it opened because never saw any cars when I drove by.

Today was different. The parking lot was virtually packed. When I walked in the first words out of my worth were, \"They ruined it!\"

It's drab drab drab....cheap crap tables and chairs, bland walls, some leftover decor.

The server was amazingly friendly and attentive - other than forgetting the strawberry jam we specifically requested. 

The food was delicious - the pancakes AMAZING! As were the veggie omelets.

This place completely redeemed itself with the food.

Bravo!

Will return."}
{"text":"We came here thinking that it was just like the restaurant on Gilbert and Guadalupe, we were wrong. I ordered the veggie omelette, the eggs tasted like the egg beaters that come in the container and the veggies were still hard and raw. The pancakes were stiff and cardboard like. On a positive note, the restaurant was very clean and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I've driven by here a lot on my way to work and thought my boyfriend and I would have to try it one day.  Today happened to be that day and we had a bogo coupon that came in the mail. It was 10am and the place was empty except for 3-4 tables, plus the table in the very back by the bathroom that had a group of older people, (I personally would not sit back there as I would feel like an ignored customer.) We were seated quite quickly at an awkward booth and chair table. Looked at the giant menu that was overpriced while waiting for drinks to find what looked tasty and ordered. My boyfriend ordered a simple waffle and I ordered the southwest delight scramble with biscuits and red potatoes,  it sounded good. The description was three scrambled eggs, with peppers, onions, tomatoes,  spicy chorizo sausage (mind you it says spicy), salsa, sour cream, and corn tortillas.  After about 10-15 minutes our food arrived. His waffle was mediocre and kind of dry he stated. Mine, it was thrown on the plate and was not pleasant to look at. As I stated earlier about the spicy chorizo, there was no spice to be had. The eggs were soggy and were loaded with stringy onions and mushy tomatoes with no peppers to be seen. It was very bland. The potatoes were burt to a crisp. You think of a biscuit being hot, light, and fluffy, these were heavy, tasteless, balls of dough. As I was studying my plate I came to notice my salsa, sour cream and corn tortillas were missing from the dish. I did not bother to ask because it would not have made the meal better. I was done after two bites. I just finished my biscuit and ate what non burnt potatoes I could find. Our waitress came by to see how things were going and I bluntly put it out there that my dish was bland and not good. She seemed oblivious, stated \"oh!\" and walked away. We thought she was getting a manager, but turns out just went back to serving her other tables with nothing else to be said only to come back and drop the check. We will not be back. Bad food and bad service. I wouldn't even give this one star but you have to rate it something."}
{"text":"Guys, today I had the most amazing thing ever! Cinnamon roll french toast. Let that sink in for a little bit. Brunch changer! 

Imagine this: 2 giant house baked cinnamon rolls, flattened, dunked into a special egg batter and then griddle'd up like classic french toast, but the end results are wild! 

I never knew that I desired some crunch on my french toast, but the crispy parts on these french toast were absolutely phenomenal. Plus, my teeth appreciated that it wasn't overly sweet. 

You also have a choice of bacon, ham, or sausage and 2 eggs any style. I requested to have my bacon extra crispy and they made it perfect! The price of $10.59 is not bad for the amount food that you get; It's enough to cover your breakfast for 2 days! 

On other occasions, I have also tried their Sweet Potato Pancake Combo $10.59 - 3 large and moist sweet potato pancakes, with your choice of bacon, ham or sausage and also 2 eggs. I chose sausage and 2 sunny eggs. Everything was perfect and I also really enjoyed the subtle natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes in the pancakes. The pancakes are different and I like that option. Flavor rating: 4/5

Smoked Brisket Benedict $10.59 - The brisket is tender and adds a great variety to the world of Benedicts. However, the meat failed to have presence in flavor and was lost in the hollandaise sauce. Flavor rating: 3/5

Country Benedict $10.59 - a country classic crowd pleaser. I felt that the sausage gravy had a slight watery consistency, but my date didn't have any complaints. You really can't pass the giant portions. It's truly enough to feed 3 adults comfortably. Flavor rating: 3/5

Biscuit and Gravy - They are called biscuits cafe, it only makes sense to try it! I really enjoy their homemade thick and creamy gravy with sausage bits. However, their biscuits were a little dense for our preference. I found that soaking the biscuits in the gravy longer until they soften, is an ideal way to enjoy this dish. Flavor rating: 4/5 

P.S. If you don't like soggy hash-browns (like me) I would suggest requesting to have them extra crispy! 

The bustling diner feel is charming and cozy; it's a real local's joint. I also really appreciate the wholehearted honesty of our waitress when she gave us her opinion on certain menu items - she really knows her food!

The prices are competitive and the portions are indulgent. These portions were meant to be shared. Bring your appetite and leave your boring toast at home."}
{"text":"Visited this place before heading to the Cardinals game on Sunday. There wasn't a big wait.
We ordered our coffee and orange juice and the drinks were delivered soon enough. It took a while before the wait staff returned to take our food order.
When we ordered my friend and I were very specific about asking for our eggs over-medium. Unfortunately every egg delivered to our table was very runny, badly under cooked. It was quite unappetizing. 
The place is named \"Biscuits\" so we were all anticipating some amazing biscuits. Yet what we received were ordinary in flavor and small. The gravy was average at best.
One more thing which really disappointed us as customers - they do not accept the American Express card.
Overall this place was a let down. It's certainly over-priced for what you get. We'll stick with The Good Egg."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday June 11 while visiting the Phoenix area and must say we had excellent service considering it was very busy. There were 8 of us and our waitress Theresa kept up with all of the refills of coffee and iced tea. I got the almond crusted French toast that was absolutely fabulous!  It did not require syrup!  Hopefully the Biscuits here in Las Vegas is as good."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about everything was very good including the coffee 
we ordered eggs and hash everything was just as it should be 
highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"For some reason I expected Biscuits Cafe to be a lot better than it was.

Woke up early Sunday morning to have breakfast with my mother and we decided to try Biscuits Cafe. I heard tons of good reviews about their food. Mom decided to try their infamous Hollandaise brisket breakfast special and I had their country omelette with red potatoes and biscuits. The Hollandaise breakfast needed to be seasoned more. It just wasn't that good. My omelette was pretty runny and my potatoes were underdone. The biscuits, that the place is named after, were good but not memorable. The staff was pleasant and the atmosphere was clean and warm. I just wish the food was better. I definitely think Yoli's Cafe is better with the food and service."}
{"text":"Everything is so good and fresh. It starts with good ingredients. Everyone is friendly and the service is great."}
{"text":"Horrible service & food. This is my 3rd time here and I am so disappointed. My first visit was when they just opened and it took over an hour to get our food. Unfortunately we spent our entire lunch break waiting for food that never came. The second time was decent. But today, it took our waiter 30 min to bring us water and coffee. The food I ordered came out wrong and the hashbrowns were cold. When we told the waiter he proceeded to touch the hashbrowns with his fingers before he took it away. The biscuits were dry and hard and the gravy was grainy. I wish this place was better because it is so close to where we live but sadly we will not be back. I've tried this place multiple times and it is NOT worth it. If you want pricey & mediocre food with the worst service then this is your place."}
{"text":"Food was good but way overpriced. 13 dollars is overpriced for breakfast. Portions are big. If I want good food and big portions I'll choose cracker barrel over this place."}
{"text":"Get to know this place!  Biscuits Cafe is a breakfast and lunch place featuring home style cooking and which is headquartered in the Pacific Northwest.  However, they also have some locations in the Sunbelt, such as this one on Las Vegas's west side.

I was given a Biscuits gift certificate and, instead of using it locally, I used it at this location.  This Biscuits is in a dime a dozen strip mall off of Sahara where the tenants are now but a blur.  What I do remember is that there was plenty of parking.  I also remember that, while close to Summerlin, it was not at all like Summerlin, though that fancy high rise residential tower was fairly close by.  It was on one of the major brash thoroughfares with three lanes in each direction, with lots of retail, and with people driving briskly, as is often the case here.

While a Biscuits in some place like the Pacific Northwest may choose to be homey because the area sort of likes that vibe, this one in Las Vegas is spacious, comfortable, clean, and awash in natural light.

And, because I surmised that they might do breakfast well and to get more mileage from the funds on my gift certificate, my friend and I went for breakfast platters at approximately the lunch hour.  That was a good decision.

The breakfast platters were very good, featuring traditional staples and with \"plenty of meat on their bones,\" figuratively speaking.  Breakfast food can be heavy and sort of bog you down.  Here, it was filling without doing that.  I don't know how the kitchen would \"lighten up\" the breakfast fare, but it hit the sweet spot.

The service was amicable and casual.  We got to sit were we wanted.  The air conditioning worked like a charm and, in addition to our beverages, our glasses of water were also kept filled.

The experience at this Biscuits was essentially seamless on all levels.  They know how to put together a good breakfast.  I'm betting that they also know how to put together a good lunch.  I wouldn't mind finding out."}
{"text":"Awesome Breakfast/Lunch Spot. Staff and management is amazing. The almond crusted French toast breakfast is the best I've had. Fresh squeezed lemonade is perfect."}
{"text":"Decent experience. I don't understand why Yelp asks you to keep writing long reviews...?"}
{"text":"Hubby and I arrived about 9:30 hungry for breakfast. Might have been 15-18 patrons at tables, some waiting on their food. We were seated next to the entrance to the kitchen, which is Nikkis section and was told Nikki would be right over to take our order. We watched for 13 minutes the comings and going of waitress with plates of food dashing to hungry patrons, but also noticed a heavy set young female waitress chatting with a male waiter where the other wait staff was busy picking up orders. The chunky female stood there laughing and playing with her hair (gross) chatting up the male waiter, kept looking our way, but never came over. The waitress who seated us, believe her name is Amber, came back by and asked if Nikkie had taken our order. We told her no, that perhaps we would go some place else. She apologized for Nikkies non appearance, took our order, and brought us coffee. Amber went to the kitchen area, placed our order, then she must have said something to Nikki about ignoring us. We were given the 'go to hell look' from the chunky waitress which we found out was Nikki. Nikki brought our food, didn't say one word, placed the plates on the table and left, not I'm sorry for the mix-up, she said nothing, she went back to the kitchen and chatted up with the male waiter all the while playing with her hair. Perhaps I need to make a phone call to the Health Dept, and they could speak to Biscuits Café and Nikki about the importance of keeping your hands out of your hair while waiting tables. Sorry Biscuits, you have failed!"}
{"text":"I would not eat here the food was horrible hash browns taste like old oil left bad taste in my mouth found hair in potato and my wife fish"}
{"text":"Aside from the almond crunch French toast; this place is just mediocre. The wait is always long, and it's just not worth it for such a basic breakfast. The servers are always kind though, and the food doesn't take too long to come out. All in all I would give it a 6\10"}
{"text":"Really good, surprisingly! Went for breakfast,  had chicken fried steak, eggs, biscuits and gravy and it was all good."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast place. We love the almond crusted French toast an biscuits and gray. Yummy."}
{"text":"I been saved!!!!!! Too hungry and in right place!

It worth of waiting 10-15 mins!!!
Been here numerous times. Very recommend!"}
{"text":"My favorite is the Country Benedict.  They always poach the eggs just right, not too hard or over cooked.  The hash browns have some kind of weird taste like the oil is bad or something but I put the sausage gravy on it and then it's great.  The sausage gravy is the best I have ever had.  It has some kind of herb that just add that little something that other places don't have. 

Service is always terrific.  The wait staff are so friendly and polite.  I don't know their names but in particular there is a young African American man and a petite lady with short brown hair who always make you feels so welcome.  I know it can be a demanding job, but these two always seem like there is nothing they would rather do than help you.  Really nice customer service. 

The cinnamon rolls are amazing, similar to Cinnabon but better. 

I once had a patti melt but wasn't impressed.  The bread wasn't crunchy and the burger was greasy.

I'll stick to the breakfast as they have never let me down with that!!!!

This is a great place to dine."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!! Chicken Apple Sausage is second to none, pancakes are fluffy and HUGE, eggs are always done right. Cafe mocha is a lovely change from the standard coffee, and the cinnamon rolls are ginormous! The decor and service are old school in all the right ways - looks like home and the treat you like family. I am NEVER disappointed coming in here, even on busy days."}
{"text":"For lack of a better description, this place was just okay. I got a BLT and Fries.

The Bad:

Too toasted bread, I ended up scratch the corner of my lip trying to bite into it.

Parts of the bacon were so hard I literally could not bite into it. 

The fries tasted like fries you would get from the freezer section at Walmart and bake at home and they didn't cook all the way. 

The Good:

Good Service
Not extremely packed 
Variety of options
Fresh vegetables-on a BLT having fresh lettuce and tomato is key and they had it. 

I may give them a second chance eating , but I definitely ordering  some of their biscuits to go as I am eager to try their namesake."}
{"text":"Three stars: 1 for fast movement in the wait list and 2 for the awesome waitress we had. 
Meh!! I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. Two entrees and 2 coffees was $32 w/o tip. I felt it was overpriced for bland food we received. Service was great, our server was attentive never had empty coffee or water. 

My husband ordered the almond French toast and it was so hard. Yuck.

I was excited to try my pancakes because they seemed so fluffy but they were also hard. 

The search goes on to find a breakfast restaurant here in Surprise."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Came here late brunch on a Sunday after a fail somewhere else. Staff was awesome. Food amazing. Loved their homemade jellies."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place wether you are eating by yourself, with a friend, or with 4 other people. My family and I have been here a few times, there is really something for everyone on the menu. The chicken tenders are amazing I have ever had, we all love them so much. I would really suggest trying them if you're a fan of that! The eggs and really anything we've tried is very good, and they really do cater to your specific preferences. I personally am not all that crazy about breakfast but they have a \"keep it simple\" section on their menu! The service is good, they are always nice and they are efficient. I feel like they could do a little bit of a better job motivating the servers and maybe get a few more because it seems like they are spread thin. But we do enjoy this place, you really get the feel that they want every customer to have a good experience."}
{"text":"This place is the absolute worst. The waitress was eating and cleaning the refrigerator after she took our drink order and took 10 minutes to get us two iced teas. She touched the rims of the glasses with her hands, which were covered with cleaning solution. After 30 minutes our food was still not served and four other parties were served before us. We saw one of our items sitting on the counter getting cold for 15 minutes while the other servers were bending over the counter and squishing the food with their aprons.  When we complained about how long it was taking the manager started arguing with us, so we left the payment on the table in cash and walked out. The attitudes of the staff and manager are EXTREMELY poor. Not only does this place NOT care about the quality of service it also seems that the employees ignore health codes and do not care about remaining in business. STAY AWAY AND DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"}
{"text":"So dissatisfied with this morning visit ...My boyfriend and I are loyal long time customers . We have been coming long before they switched to the new woman Manager . My boyfriend ordered the fajita omelette with pancakes and sausage . I ordered the cinnamon roll French toast with bacon and scrambled eggs . When our food came Out it wasn't done the eggs were runny...my French toast was doughy and not cooked well . It was also a smaller portion , the bacon was burnt . We ended up telling our server that we were dissatisfied and walked out .  We both have rewards points that we signed up for a year ago . This may be our last visit . Where are the cooks ??? The manager is in the back cooking and it doesn't taste the same . Seems like they are understaffed and the food and customer service is going down . We are now at black bear diner about to enjoy some pineapple upside down pancakes with all the fixings . Biscuits cafe feels like a ghost town wth is going on ??? The old manager was so nice and always spoke to the customers and was concerned with the taste of the food . The manager never ever came out just stayed in the kitchen hidden . We live a block over and it was a complete waste of time to get let down . A very sad experience !!!!"}
{"text":"I was happy when I finally ate here since it is located just a block down the street from my house.  The atmosphere is very home-style kitchen esque. I absolutely love their eggs benedict and who can resist a giant gooey cinnamon roll!! The coffee could be stronger for sure, but unless I'm at a coffee shop or home, my expectation of receiving strong coffee anywhere is pretty low."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for the first time. It was just okay. Hash browns came out cold. Corned beef hash was terrible. Potatoes were crunchy and it had zero flavor. Drinks were never refilled even though server came back to check on us a couple of times. I probably won't go back until I see an improvement on food and service."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Biscuits Cafe and I am beyond disappointed and will not be returning. The first time we went the food was great service was awesome and you get so much food!! This last visit was disturbing to say the least. Our food arrvies and I noticed that there was a drop of red stuff on my plate, thought it was ketchup so I wiped it with my finger and it was BLOOD!! I immediately went to the restroom and washed my hands and asked for my server the manager. I showed them the plate and when I looked at my other plates yes there was blood on them too. The manager proceeds to say oh I don't think that's blood it maybe blueberries...???! So I am now a little upset because I know the difference between a blueberry and freaking BLOOD!!! I gave the place a second chance to remake the food the kitchen staff that I had thought and mentioned to the server who's hand was cut was now wearing gloves... Well a little grossed out we didn't finish our food even though it was good. Now at the end of our meal and considering what happened I did expect a discount for having a stranger's blood on multiple plates but that didn't happen we had a full bill no discount and was offered a cinnamon roll.. really a cinnamon roll so I declined paid my bill and left."}
{"text":"Gravy not great. Was not sausage gravy, but pepper gravy. Biscuits were tough. I normally can break up biscuits with fork but not these biscuits. Wife had strawberry waffle and she said it was good, so that is why 3 stars instead of 2"}
{"text":"First visit to Biscuits Café (open for just over a year), early on a Sunday morning.  Even at 7 a.m. opening, the place had a good-size crowd.  Server was Robert who was quick and attentive--covering many tables, he still refilled beverages without having to be reminded.  Food was good, well-prepared and served hot--and VERY generous portions, including two biscuits with each breakfast order.  Great home-made strawberry jam was served in a small cup on each plate instead of those little plastic packets on the table.  Prices were moderate--in line with other local breakfast spots like Village Inn, Denny's, and Coco's--but food here is much better (with large servings), while atmosphere, staffing, and cleanliness are all better here than at most other places."}
{"text":"Horrible food!  No flavor! My boyfriend and me decided to try a new spot, which I totally regret now. Ordered steak and eggs over easy with hash browns with a biscuit. First off the steak wash not even cooked it had zero seasoning at all, I guess they cook it on the flat top she said with no seasoning. Rise and Shine in Summerlin has way better steak! No grill marks wtf! I had to send it back, next the hash brows had no flavor, I get they are simple but how do you mess that up ? Anyways asked for sausage links instead, brought me patties. So basically didn't eat meat I asked to remove the meat all together as soon as I saw, which they did. As for my boyfriends his cheesy eggs looked like liquid disgusting. I think my 5 year old could do a better job. I told the person checking us out how horrible my meal  was, you would think she would remove it. Clearly they don't care! Don't eat here people unless you want to leave disgusted!! Nasty as can be!! Oh yea the biscuit was disgusting too I think bisquick taste amazing compared to that thing they have! I didn't take a picture of my steak sent  it back too fast. My boyfriends eggs are below."}
{"text":"Wow! Never again.... I had some family in town and ended up taking the 6 of us to Biscuits Café for a Brunch around 10am. We had heard good things about it and expected it to be busy, and it was. We really didn't mind the 35 minute wait to get seated; but the following, no customer should have to go through. 
It took a few minutes for our waitress to get to us after being sat at a just wiped down table. We got our coffee & menus, and then about 10 minutes later she finally came back with a stack of napkins and a handful of silverware (literally) that she just put on the table in a pile. So, 35 minutes after taking our order, she returned to the table and apologized because the kitchen was so busy the food tickets were running at about 30 minutes to fill. In the mean time, we watched another table turn over and get their food before us. Well, after our 45+ minute wait for our food it came to us COLD, and since the waitress didn't return to check on us for another 10 minutes, we ended up eating our cold breakfast. For a supposed Breakfast/Brunch specialty establishment... They are about the worst their is!!! A $110 breakfast with this service.... NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Very testy breakfast, I loved the pancakes. It's was a very pleasant atmosphere and quick service"}
{"text":"The food is actually good. I'd give it a 4. The one is for service. I tried it for the first time about six months ago. My friend and I came in for breakfast. There was only one other customer there and one waitress. The waitress was having a full on conversation with this customer. We waited for about 5 minutes. We were just ignored. We finally just sat down. This waitress continued her conversation for another 10 minutes. Then finally came over gave us menus, went back to her conversation for another 10 minutes. I wanted to leave, but my friend wanted to wait. We finally got served. The food was good. I decided to give it another try today. It's close to the house. Same friend. We went. They were busy. We were seated right away. Good sign, right! Nope. We were waiting for literally about 15 minutes to give our order. This entire time the manager was standing in the isle beside me talking to the people behind us. She was loud! We had to hear about her daughter's college, how she shops at Walmart, what kind of snacks her daughter wants for college. On and on she went! We shot her a few looks like, first of all, can you take our order and 2. can you shut up? She was literally giving me a headache. I don't know who these people were, the owners or frequent customers, but it was ridiculous! You want to talk, sit down and talk. Don't yell out your business in my ear!! Better yet, do your job and make sure customers are taken care of! Then the waitress who brought our food finally came to see if we wanted more coffee. Our cups were empty so of course we said yes. Instead of going to get the coffee to fill our empty cups that she's neglected, she starts chatting up the same people behind us! The manager had finally stepped away for a moment comes back and starts again, now she has pictures on her phone! So now we have the two of them yakking! My friend finally interrupted and asked her to get the coffee.  This was not an enjoyable experience to say the least. Then we get to the register. My friend pays the bill. The boy running the register punched a wrong button and had to make change the old fashioned educated way, using your brain! Well, he couldn't manage that and my friend had to tell him what the change is. Needless to say, I will never go back there and I will definitely pass on my experience to others. I can't imagine how this place stays in business. If you like slow service and want to know more about strangers than you ever cared to, then this is the place for you! The food is good, but not worth dealing with the nonsense and unprofessional behavior."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my wife on a Saturday morning. Not real busy but ample seating. I had the chicken fried steak, really good,  the gravy was delicious . The red potatoes were  gummy and undercooked . I ordered the sourdough toast and it came with one slice cut in half . Who charges 12.00 a plate and only gives one slice of bread ? Biscuits Cafe does that's who. I asked the waitress if that's the norm and she said yes if you want more you'll have to order it as a side. ...... What? Prisoners get more bread than you do here . Very pricey place for what you get. I might try again to see if they serve you half a sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast egg over easy biscuits and grave and bacon.  Eggs were practically raw.   I said I couldn't eat them. Whites weren't cooked. Sent them back for over medium. Whites were still partly raw. I wasn't going to send them back again.  Somebody needs to teach the cook how to make eggs. The gravy for the biscuit wasn't very good either. Not what you'd expect biscuits and gravy to taste like.  I think I maybe saw 2 pieces of sausage in the gravy.  Don't think I'll becoming back again. The place has gone downhill."}
{"text":"Breakfast with the family, 2 adults 3kids.  Menu was good,  variety of omelets, scrambles, french toast, pancakes to name a few of them.  It was super busy, all employeess were nice,  greeted us, asked if everything was good several times.  Issue: eggs and pancakes were over cooked, we could tell kitchen staff was overwhelmed.  Everything else was great will definitely give a second chance, will try again."}
{"text":"I like the feel of this cafe style spot. I ate breakfast, but there were other options for lunch as well. The food is better than Denny's and the staff is friendly. I would definitely eat here again when i'm in the area for breakfast! I had a chicken fried steak - we all know it's all about the gravy, and I'm glad to say that I enjoyed theirs . . . the most important part of the review is the taste!"}
{"text":"Hey y'all!  I was so excited to see a new breakfast place settle into what I think is a very prime location - perfect for a huge residential neighborhood that doesn't want to travel north to Good Egg, east to Ihop or south for Mimi's.  I ordered the corned beef hash (one of my personal favorites that is not always on a breakfast menu, crazy - I know right?)  Husband wanted the Florentine Benedict without the spinach, but got talked into the Avocado, the kids chocolate chip pancakes.  I had a nibble ... well ... okay, I had like three nibbles and it was a very yummy pancake.  They were excited about their hot chocolates - the do a great job presenting it!  I liked my corned beef hash, but it was probably a little on the healthy side :) as it wasn't oozing with salt.  But that's actually a good thing because I'm trying to watch my portions and the salt would have begged me to devour the whole thing.  There was enough meat and potatoes for three breakfasts.  It was huge.

Poor husband.  He wanted the Florentine without the spinach because it's more like the Eggs Benedict he's accustomed to.  The server suggested the Avocado thinking that would be better but it didn't have HAM.  So he was a little deflated.  The hollandaise smelled very strong to me for some reason.  We ordered a side of bacon to compensate and while it was 4 slices of natural cut bacon, that was $4 worth of bacon.  Which leads me to the biggest beef ... it's probably a tad pricier than Good Egg and definitely pricier than Ihop.  So I had to nick a star, sorry guys.

Would I go back?  Definitely - I like the convenient location - maybe next time I'll try something a little 'easier' on the eyes.  And I like that it hasn't caught on just yet.  WHO WANTS TO WAIT FOR BREAKFAST?!  I am somewhat a patriot too, so I loved the wood paneled wall that had the Bill of Rights and Constitution framed ... made my heart feel good.

4 stars for good intentions ... and sorry for the long post ... it's a new place and I just wanted to make sure the people were informed."}
{"text":"Our waitress Brandy was one of the best I've seen in awhile. Great customer service very attentive! 5 stars for her...however, the food was very good but they do not offer a military discount.  With an Air Force nearby and the military communities in the area it was very unfortunate. 
Other cafes offer a military discount #dontforgetthemenandwomenwhoserve#freedom#takecareofyourown"}
{"text":"OK but overpriced food. 

Decent service, but why do all the people working here look miserable?"}
{"text":"Bring your appetite!!! I am a big guy and I couldn't finish my ultra delicious Southwest Scramble which came with two large fluffy pancakes!!! My wife had the breakfast tacos which looked good and my wife said tasted good but would only do bacon in the future. 

I would give 4.5 if possible as the food is really tasty but is more traditional and less outside the box. 

The restaurant is clean and well put together. Seems like a traditional breakfast diner/cafe. Lots of business type people here for lunch. 

Overall 4.5 stars (rounded up) for great food, huge portions, excellent service, a clean restaurant with a nice atmosphere. Super impressed, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I had the house made hash and hubby had the avocado benedict. Both were delicious and the jam and biscuits were off the charts!"}
{"text":"We went in for breakfast this morning. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was great, service was quick. Our waitress was wonderful. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We ordered pancakes. My plate had somebody's salad remnants on it, lettuce and some kind of a small seed. The plate clearly had not been washed. Plate was dull looking and greasy, not sparkling clean. We alerted the first person we could find and their response was, \"Do you want me to take it back?\"   Our response was, \"What do you think?\"  DUH!!!
Deplorable and completely inexcusable.  We will never return."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about the amazing breakfast I had last Sunday. Having mentally bookmarked Biscuits Cafe several times, we finally pulled the trigger to check it out. On the outside, the restaurant is unassuming, so I'll do the bragging for them. 

Despite it looking busy, we were seated right away. Our waitress came by to wish us a good morning and pour us coffee and water. Their coffee mugs have a sleek black design with their red logo - also for purchase on the way out. 

We pored through the menu calling attention to the great variety of breakfast specialties: Corned beef hash, black oak kielbasa, chicken apple sausage... I could go on. I ordered the Kielbasa, that came with two eggs, hash browns and a choice of biscuits, toast or pancakes. I chose the biscuits, which were soft and warm, tearing apart easily for me to lather on butter and what tasted like strawberry preserves. I don't often share amazing food, but I had to give my girlfriend a taste so she could see what I was raving about. Let me also point out that the hash browns are no ordinary helping. They overflow along the sides of your plate, offering a wonderfully tasty crunch and fresh potato underneath. And, the Kielbasa had just enough spicy, smoky tenderness to satisfy even the pickiest of sausage fans.

If my girlfriend hadn't ordered the Avocado Benedict, I would have. Fans of poached egg and hollandaise creations, look no further! These come with tomato and avocado, hash browns or red potatoes. Well assembled and not runny or soggy. Definitely in my top 3 of Benedict's ever tasted.

It was hard to leave food on my plate, but I had to. I was just too full to keep going. I can't wait until the next Sunday morning when I can come back for Round 2!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went to this cafe for breakfast, we were in a hurry and the hostess could tell, so they made it a priority to get our food as soon as possible to go. The employees were incredibly nice and Alex especially was amazing in making sure we got what we needed and made us feel like a family. Thanks biscuits cafe!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice and wish we lived closer.  The place is immaculate and tastefully decorated.  The staff is friendly, courteous, and helpful but not overbearing.  The food is outstanding - especially the omelets, bacon, sourdough bread, jam, and more.  Not fast service but quality dishes perfectly prepared and served piping hot.  Not inexpensive, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Here I was thinking \"yay a new favorite breakfast spot\" until I crunched into something alien in my red potatoes. Not sure if it was eggshell or glass or sand. But it ended my desire to take another bite immediately. So disappointed because I was really enjoying the eggs Benedict prior to that."}
{"text":"Sadly, my first time at this location is disappointing. The service was good, but my sausage was cold, and my dining partner, who ordered the waffle said his waffle was cold, his eggs were overlooked and his bacon was so over cooked it crumbled to the touch. Still searching for the ultimate breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I am giving this place two stars one for the service was and second the place was very clean and well decorated.

The cons, so a place that has the word biscuits in the name should be known for some killer biscuits and gravy. Nope , biscuits were not soft and didn't have to much flavor. I also got a side of red potato's  , should have save the extra $1.99, as they were hard as well.  My mom had a order of pancakes just three and a side of fruit. With my one biscuit meal and two coffees the bill was over $30.  I was hoping for more since I live in surprise and like the short drive."}
{"text":"We normally LOVE Biscuits, but our experience yesterday may cause us to never go back. 

The restaurant was busy, so the initial wait to be greeted at the table is understandable, but after that.... 

We ordered two adult meals, 1 kids meal and a side of eggs and the only item that came out correct was the side of eggs. My sons meal had hash browns when he asked for red potatoes (twice), my wife didn't get the egg whites she ordered, got bacon instead of sausage and pancakes instead of toast. The server was apologetic, but at no time did a manager come by our table to talk with us about all the mistakes. We had to ask for our check 3 times and when it came no compensation for all the mistakes was offered. 

I paid the 30+ dollars and decided we'd just have to find a new breakfast place for the future."}
{"text":"Very good food, good service.  This is the \"everybody wants breakfast but no one want to cook\" go to place.  They have great country gravy, the blueberry pancakes get more than 5 blueberries like most places, and the coffee is good.  

If you are looking for typical, American Style, breakfast cuisine, you cant go wrong.  The only reason i give 4 instead of 5 stars is inconsistency.  Sometimes service and/or food can be a bit off, but all in all, i go here once a month.  Try it and see!"}
{"text":"I went in the other day me and my wife and the food wss good most DEFF fresh n hott I loved the fact that the gravy wasn't soo salty I hate salty food but verry clean on the inside  I had the chicken fried steak bomb very tasty ;*) fyi there bacon is soo yummy n thick cooked just like  I like it !!!"}
{"text":"Thursday 2/12
11am

My boyfriend and I just had to walk out of this place because we were seated and just left alone for 15 minutes without a single person coming up to us to take even a drink order. It seemed like the feeling was mutual within the whole restaurant. People were looking around to see where the servers were and if they were ever going to get their food/drink. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for the weekend with a friend and he suggested that we give this place a try. I'm glad we did, it was a pleasant surprise. We went in for breakfast around 10:00 AM on Sunday morning and it was busy, but not packed. We were quickly seated in a large booth and served coffee right away in an oversized coffee mug. We didn't have to wait too long before our waitress took our orders.

The menu had great selections for breakfast and of course their specialty...biscuits & gravy. I ordered the  Black Oak Kielbasa that came with two eggs, choice of hash browns or red potatoes and choice of biscuits, toast or pancakes. I had my eggs over easy, hash browns and of course biscuits. When my food arrived I was pleased that the food was prepared just right. The biscuits were very warm and seemed fresh out of the oven. The Kielbasa was tasty and the biscuits were definitely good! 

Overall, my friend and I enjoyed our breakfast...we had no complaints with either the food or service. The restaurant set-up was very spacious, bright and clean. They even have newspapers available for the customers to read. In addition, it's located in a nice area of town in a strip mall...so parking is plentiful & convenient. Check out the photos I posted...

As a side note, we liked it enough that we went back the following day for breakfast again...we were in the area & it was just convenient. It was a Monday morning around 9:00 AM. It wasn't busy and our waitress was very attentive. My friend and I both ordered the French Toast Combo and we both felt that the French Toast was good. The next time I'm back in LV, I plan on having breakfast here again."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place and are glad we did. The restaurant is really large. Didn't expect it to be as large as it was really but it was nice. They traded cute for functionality at this place and honestly I prefer it. Other breakfast places are cute and petit but they end up have long lines and obnoxious waits because of it. This place was able to seat is right away even though there were lots of people dining and we got our food quickly. The prices were competitive too. They have a rewards program with good benefits as well. We will definitely be back for the convenience and good food"}
{"text":"Menu is fabulous different variations of standard breakfasts' dishes.  Homemade biscuits and jams. Perfectly prepared egg dishes. Light fluffy pancakes. I had the fresh blueberry pancakes...perfect!  Not your tiny coffee cup, no, no. A real coffee mug. Family operated. Warm, friendly fast service. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I came here on Father's Day around noon after a hike at Pinnacle Peak. Overheated and starved, I was ready to load up on carbs and protein. I ordered the Country Benedict, which consists of a biscuit, two sausage patties and two poached eggs smothered in gravy. It also came with a choice of hash browns, red potatoes or a substitution of fruit for an additional $1. The meal was enjoyable but average, much like the restaurant itself. Furthermore, the restaurant's temperature was a little too warm for me and I usually prefer not to sweat while I eat my breakfast."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our breakfast. Great customer service. Was a little pricey but worth the visit"}
{"text":"First time there,  we had the cinnamon roll french toast it comes with eggs and choice of ham sausage or bacon. Also had the 1 biscuit and gravy with eggs and ham. Both choices were good sized portions.   Delicious very nice restaurant. The menu has lots of choices we were very happy with our meals.  We had a coupon in the weekly coupon mailing."}
{"text":"If you know how to look, Las Vegas is famous for \"locals only\" funky spots tucked into a shopping malls. And this Breakfast place is just that. 

When I am in the mood to go out for breakfast, I want \"Diner Style\"- big, hearty, classic and delicious. I have eaten at Biscuits many times and have never been disappointed.

Sausage Benedict- YUM! My partner says the Sweet Potato pancakes are the best he has every had! The scrambles are really good too!"}
{"text":"The thought of an $12 breakfast still has me reeling. The portion was nice, and the quality was okay. Corned beef hash was waaay over seasoned with a burned oregano overtone , while the hashbrowns, were completely flavorless, and raw in the middle. Ironically(?) the biscuits were damn good.  I ate like an 1/8 of it. (See picture)."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our breakfast here. I had the country Benedict which is biscuits topped with sausage, poached eggs and sausage gravy. Also included hash browns. It was really yummy but the eggs were poached a little hard and next time I'll get the gravy on the side (too much gravy on the plate). My husband had the apple sausage with eggs, hash browns and biscuits. He said it was good. The strawberry preserves that came with it was very good, like homemade. My son got the chocolate chip pancakes. He loved them. The restaurant was busy but we were seated right away and service was quick. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"I think the food is good. It's nothing to rave about but it's still good enough to keep me coming back. The staff is friendly and they have excellent service. This is one of the only Breakfast places in the area, besides IHOP and Denny's. I fall in love with their jams!!! They are freaking amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot begin tell how how AMAZING this delightful little restaurant is. Upon walking in, the first thing you'll smell is coffee. Delicious coffee that is roasted in house and also available for purchase. The smell alone will make you glad you came. Then you'll look at the menu and be torn on what to order because it all sounds good. (Let me recommend the Almond French Toast. It's amazing!) The service is wonderful and you'll have a small army of smiling, helpful wait staff coming over to refill coffee and check on you often. When the food arrives it will look delicious and beautiful. The best part is, that no matter what you order, you'll find a chocolate covered strawberry on your plate. It's the manager's touch, and a lovely way to finish off a delicious and delightful dining experience. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We were hungry!! Any food would have made us happy.....but...we have to say, B Cafe came to the rescue.  Great service , shout out to Dan! our amazing server who even supplied some much needed hangover ibuprofin to the table!  We were visitors to this city and sadly, are thinking: we might never be back and two, wishing there was a brunch spot like this in PHilly!!"}
{"text":"Well, Biscuits Cafe opened up at a location that has seen two other businesses crumble! After having breakfast there this mourning with my wife. I really don't see them lasting here either. We will come back to try lunch, hopefully it will be better? 
We decided to try a variety of things this morning. We ordered the biscuits and gravy, apple wood sausage breakfast with over easy eggs, hash browns, it also came with pancakes. Wife ordered: red potatoes, scrambled eggs, and sourdough toast. We also added a cinnamon roll.

Food:
It really wasn't that big of a deal. Biscuit was kind of rubbery, and I was not a big fan of how the gravy was seasoned. And yes I said seasoned since the gravy was probably the only item that was seasoned. I asked for the hash browns to be well done, the only thing that was well done was the outside layer. It was crispy, however the inside was a little to mushy for me. I did like the apple wood sausage, but it did need to be cooked a little bit longer. Pancakes were OK if you put enough butter and syrup. The texture wasn't all that great. Wife's red potatoes looked really good, but again it wasn't seasoned enough. The cinnamon roll looked really good, they over do it with the frosting, it is served hot. You might want to let it cool down first. Because when you eat it hot, it like eating a cinnamon puff? Lots of air. 

Service was OK, more like a cafeteria environment. 

With Archies, Nicks I and Nicks II near by, this place will need to improve to stay around."}
{"text":"Super delicious food!  Very generous portions.  Wait staff was very attentive, especially Theresa.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and they never disappoint. The service is just as good as the food and its outstanding! I love their French toast combo. And their coffee is delicious. I also use their reward system and I've gotten multiple discounts. I highly recommend biscuits for breakfast"}
{"text":"We came here while running errands around 11am on a Saturday. There was no wait, but when we left a while later, the place was getting packed. I think the decor is what turned me off the most. It was like a cafeteria in a hospital. Very stark and minimally decorated if you can call some stenciling on the wall decorations. The wait staff also seemed off in their overall service, like they were overwhelmed or confused or short staffed. My bf said from his view, the kitchen staff didn't seem to have a handle on their roles either. Our order did come out rather quickly. It was just ok, nothing that had me jumping for joy. There are other breakfast places with a lot more oomph, pizzaz, and wow factor here in town to make me want to choose Biscuits over them."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. I went there on Saturday October 28th. The first thing I notice is that the interior is very dark admittedly they were quite busy spirit I was alone and chose to be seated outside. The chair at the table they sat me out was covered with pigeon droppings and I had to request another chair. I placed my order the combo which was eggs bacon hash browns biscuits gravy and coffee. The order took without exaggeration about 25 minutes to arrive. The waitress kept coming by saying she would check on the order and sorry for the wait. When I received my food the gravy and the eggs with cold. When I went to add cream to my coffee to cream was curdled. I complained to the waitress and she brought me a bowl of hot gravy an extra biscuit and fresh creamer. I received my check and was informed by the waitress that I had to pay on the way out at the cashier. The problem with that is the cashier area is also where they check in the customers for seating so it is a complete chaotic situation. You have people trying to check in horse eating while you have people waiting to pay the check. It was a mess and there was only one person there to take care of directing the seating and accepting a payment. For all my trouble the check was almost $20. I did voice a complaint with the girl at the cash register and she just said she was sorry due to her being so busy that was the end of that. After receiving my change I had to make my way back outside where I was seated and leave the tip. What a hassle. I try to support neighborhood businesses as I live in the area and I will give them another chance. Anyone or any business can have have a bad day. But as you can read my first experience was extremely frustrating and overall extremely poor. The waitress was a tentative and she was quite nice so I'm not sure how much of this was her fault."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for the first time and have finally found a great breakfast place in Surprise. Had a simple \"scrambler\" with ham and eggs which were cooked perfectly, red potatoes which were nicely seasoned and plentiful and a wonderful pancake and biscuit on the side. Having mentioned that I could not decide between the pancakes and the biscuits for my side, our wonderful waiter, Zach, suggested one of each. You don't often find a place so accommodating. Our waiter was very helpful and attentive offering suggestions and making us feel welcome even though we came in near the end of the day. Definitely recommend Biscuits Cafe and are glad to have them in our neighborhood. Oh..and the strawberry jam..yum!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Las Vegas and stopped in for breakfast. Kids had the chocolate pancakes. I had the chicken fried steak and it was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Gravy has good flavor. Service was very friendly. They also have an outdoor eating space with tables under umbrellas for when the weather is nice out."}
{"text":"We went in to see the new restaurant.   We have to admitt not to excited.  The wait was not long maybe 10 minutes, sat in a area that was very cold they had there ceiling fans  on and they were on fast. The wait for the food was more then 30 minutes. The food was ok we have had food at better restaurant.  Checking out took a while the server had a mistake on our ticket. She was confused on how a beverage got on there when she did not put it there.  So over all it will be the first and last time..."}
{"text":"Ordered country Benedict and had it delivered via postmates. The Benedict had no gravy on it. Just a biscuit, dry sausage and eggs. Last time I will order from this place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. We are new to area and have tried Eggworks and The Cracked Egg. I think this will definitely be a place we frequent....the Joe's Scramble was excellent. My daughter's Mac and cheese was super cheesy. Good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Generous portions, large menu. Good service. Been here a handful of times, and have not been disappointed! Katy is our favorite waitress."}
{"text":"This place is in desperate need of ceiling fans. It's almost too warm to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"As a fan of good breakfasts, I was thrilled to try the newest addition to the neighborhood here in south Chandler. Put simply, my chorizo omelet was muy bueno, and clearly cooked by someone who loves omelets as much as I do. Beautiful fluffy eggs, savory chorizo and fresh veggies. Loved it. The pancakes were very good and the coffee was decent. Crank that coffee up a notch and I'd have no trouble going five stars for breakfast. Last note, the staff is wonderful. They took great care of us and every table around us. And that's just awesome."}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered here has been delicious. The omelets are flavorful and filling. Start looking at the menu before you sit down, because once your waiter leaves your table the first time, he's not coming back. The service is terribly slow, albeit friendly. The food is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"They are always great, with the service and they always have great food! Just wish my food was hot when it got to me, it tends to always be a little cold but the biscuits and gravy are super good!"}
{"text":"This place is great. They have above average food and fair prices. The entire menu breakfast/lunch is open all day, which is great when I have family in town and we get brunch at 11:00 AM. At that point, some people want breakfast, and some want lunch. 

If you're a healthy eater, or salad fan, they have great salad menu with really generous portions. In favor of being healthful, get the dressing on the side. My favorite is the SW Chicken salad. 

This place is a real gem, especially because of the newness and cleanliness. My theory is, once they get on google maps, and discovered by more locals, they will blow up, and then there may be a weekend wait. 

I'm docking a star because I had the personal kielbasa breakfast sausage one time, and it was so salty it practically wasn't edible. I think it might have been a fluke though, and that's not something I normally order. 

They have a super friendly and robust staff. Everyone has the attitude, \"I'll get it done for you\", which I think is important especially on crowded weekend mornings. It's great to see a truly local, independent breakfast joint hit the ground running. I hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"Met my sister and her family here for breakfast.  I was very hungry.  Walked in and saw my sister and family sitting at a table.  We sat right away.  The place was nice. Started talking and notice after 15-20 minutes no one offered coffee, water or juice. Waited another 15-20 minutes still no one came to the table. Finally one of the waitress acknowledged us and that someone would be right with us. Waited another 15-20 minutes and we finally had to ask someone to get someone to wait on us.  The waitress apologized and took our orders. Another 15-20 minutes went by again and we did not get our drinks. We had to ask another waiter. He apologized and got our drinks. 

After a little wait we finally got our food.  Nice portions, presentation and food tasted great. The wait staff was more attentive because the breakfast crowd slowed and they weren't so overwhelmed. 

Overall the food was good (biscuts were great)but the service lacked.  I will give them another try and hopefully the service will be much better."}
{"text":"My parents love this place. It's decent. The 2 times I've been here I had the pancakes - very berry and chocolate chip. The portion size is huge! 

Good family friendly place and quality food."}
{"text":"Where do I start......Fist time visiting this place and everything was awful. Server forgot our drinks for 5 minutes, told my wife not to get the cinnamon French toast because it's usually soggy, my wife's coffee mug has sticky crap all over it, the walls were nasty looking like they never clean them, and to top all of it off when our food arrived their was a LONG hair in my food. We immediately got up and told our server we are leaving because of x, y, and z and we will never be back. I didn't want to waste my time even talking to a manager because they could have offered me free food for life and I would have never returned. This place is terrible on every level, go to McDonalds instead."}
{"text":"I've had the French toast and it was really good, the place was packed and service was good.  The portions were decent size, the biscuits weren't fresh & tasted as they had been sitting awhile."}
{"text":"Very good food! Wide menu variety, quick service, nice people. I love it here!"}
{"text":"It was a Sunday morning and noticed it was very busy.  It was a fun atmosphere and we were greeted with a smile right when we walked in.  We were seated within 5 minutes and a very short time later we were greeted by Chas and he took our drink orders.  Even with the very busy restaurant the service was great!  Chas was doing a great job with not only waiting on our table but I also noticed him staying on top of his other tables too.  The food was awesome!  I had the cinnamon roll pancakes and my wife had the ham & eggs benedict.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast this morning at Biscuit Cafe, for the first and last time. When I walked in the place was pretty much empty...maybe 5 customers. I was seated and given a menu quickly. I think its fairly pricey...$10.00 for bacon,eggs,hash browns and toast. With an additional $4.10 for a glass of OJ. When the waiter took my order I requested the eggs be soft boiled, \"real runny\". It took 30 minutes to receive my food. The bacon looked like it was probably good when it was first cooked but it was dried out . The hash browns were run of the mill...nothing special. But the soft boiled eggs...OMG...they couldnt have been more hard boiled. Totally the opposite of what I ordered. It took a while to get the waiters attention but when he came over to my table I showed him the eggs. He said he would get me another order of eggs. Then about 5 minutes later he came back to my table and said my eggs should be ready in about 10 minutes. Really?  So everything else sits there getting cold, while I wait 15 minutes for my 2 minute eggs. No, I told him to forget it and asked for the check. The only food that was really good was the toast and a small container of strawberry jam. Dont waste your time and money on this place. There are places in town that are much better."}
{"text":"Met friends for brunch.  The menu has breakfast and lunch options.  Waffles, biscuits, toast and of course pancakes. Soups, salads and sandwiches are options.  Burgers, fries and onion rings are optional.  Very big portions of very delicious food options."}
{"text":"I must say that I haven't been here in a few months. Decided to take my beautiful girlfriend to this place and I was hoping it was still good. Yes it was very good. She loved the place as did I. The service is great and the food is just magnificent. You can't eat it all that's for sure but man it fills your stomach. We both highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch"}
{"text":"Little has changed I'm sorry to say!  They gave us a $5 discount for her birthday. We ordered the same meal for my wife (chicken fried chicken special breakfast and I had their new sandwich, beef brisket dip with fries and a pickle.  The meat had little flavor other than a smoky one and the au jus had very little taste.  Wife's hash brown had a nice flavor but needed to be browned more, my fries were meh. Noticed that her chicken fried chicken was $1.60 more since our last visit 2 1/2 years ago, had a nice taste, still small.  A 2 1/2 star meal, please remind me if I ever think about returning :("}
{"text":"The food was tasty. The service was less than stellar. I expect somewhat of a wait to be seated on a Sunday morning at a popular place, that's not a big problem. We checked out the menus while we waited to be seated so we were able to order right when we sat down. The issue was waiting 30 minutes for our food after that. When we asked what was taking so long we were told it's busy and there's two tickets ahead of you. Magically, our food appeared about a minute later, lukewarm, with an incorrect side order. We pointed out the mistake but never did get the correct item. The family next to us heard our inquiry and said they had waited an hour and none of their food came to the table at the same time; one person was served when everyone else was almost done. The couple on the other side of us struck up a conversation to tell us they had also been waiting and were served cold soup to start but nothing since then. Behind us, I heard another couple ask what was taking so long and they were told it was busy and there were two tickets ahead of them. It's really a shame because we had high expectations and the food really was delicious once we finally got it."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Since posting this 5 star review about a year ago, I can say that Biscuits has steadily declined in both service and quality. I've been back multiple times, and it's always hit or miss with servers. Some are in a great mood and on top of their game... while others have poor hygiene, are rude, careless, and really don't care if you're happy with your meal or not. The last few times i've been in, they do not honor the $5 coupons which are sent to email for discounts (birthday, anniversary etc) even if they are not expired or have not been used. The cashier will say \"I can't find it in the system\", although I received an email from Biscuits they day prior (timestamped) advertising a $5 coupon. When asking how this can happen, the cashier simply shrugs and says \"I don't know\"... well, that's unacceptable. This morning I got breakfast to go- my usual chicken fried steak. The final straw with Biscuits (hence the updated review), they didn't include ANY gravy in my chicken fried steak meal (which included biscuits and gravy WITH NO GRAVY), eggs were cold and rubbery, potatoes slimy. Not impressed- it's unfortunate an establishment can have such a rapid decline in less than a year. This definitely explains why their competitors always have a line out the door, while Biscuits line has diminished."}
{"text":"Mediocre to marginal food. Sub par at best, fake eggs and dry chicken, be specific if you want anything well done. Good fast service with a friendly waiter, QUICK seating as well."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place because I was in the area and always seem to drive by it. Location was clean and busy this Friday morning. My server was Linda, she was amazing. Linda was friendly, joked with me, and kept me filled with coffee and water.

I got \"Joe's Scramble\" which comes with 3 eggs, spinach, tomato, red onion, sausage, and parm cheese. I forgot to say no onion, but I didn't even care. It was pretty delicious. It also came with a biscuit as a side, which I asked with gravy. The biscuits were fluffy on the inside and a nice crunch on the outside. The gravy wasn't what I was expecting though. It's like and oregano style gravy rather than a southern sausage style gravy. It wasn't bad, just different.

Everyone on the staff was courteous and never looked like they didn't have something to do.

All-in-all, great experience and I'll definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place can easily obtain a 5 star rating. The best breakfast in the area... By far. Great food a little expensive for breakfast and they need more seating with the demand. Too bad they are next to Zipps, the awful establishment next door with not very nice people working there. I recommend the scrambles and the pancakes are very good! Service is always excellent! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast here.  I really enjoyed their way of doing potatoes and of course the biscuits are light and tasty!"}
{"text":"I went to the website first to  contact them and wasn't going to yelp them.  I live close by and have been here a few times.  Every single time something is messed up.  My honest opinion is that its the management.  They need to train their employees.  Some things are not common sense.  For example during todays breakfast the waitress think her name is Michelle came over and asked the girlfriend if she wanted a refill.  Because she had basically been slow the entire meal I asked for one also mine was half full.  On the way to fill it up she stops and takes an order.  Setting out drinking on a resting table.  Common sense is that when I'm eating my meal I want to have a beverage at the same time.  And I do not want to wait for you to take an order from silver hairs which predictably  took a long time to place the order so I got up and took my drink back.  No apology.  No recognition that a mistake had been made.  Maybe she didn't realize that is not the proper way to serve a table.  Tip.  When someone flags you down while you are doing a refill tell them you just have to refill the drink and you will be right back.  So maybe things aren't common sense like when you serve potatoes.  You can't mix two batches together.  One that is crispy and another one that is raw.  You actually want to try to have your food come out consistent.  They should always be cooked the same.  Customers are not very crazy about having a few raw potatoes in every bite.

This is not the first time I have had issues at this place.  It is a cute place and they do have the best Jelly I have ever had ever. So at some point in time some one knew what they where doing.  But maybe when they setup shop in Arizona they sent out someone who was not qualified to train and open new restaurants.  I would like to believe if you go to Oregon they operate better.  I wish I could remember what some of the previous issues were. But I know it has been 6 months and mistake I tried it again.

Thing is if they cared about doing things properly they would have feedback forms in the restaurant.  And maybe a way on the website to send a message.  I'm not going to send snail mail to the corporate office to complain.  So hopefully they read this review get better management and train their employees cooks and servers.  This could be a great restaurant with a little care and TLC.

So you are warned. It's a roll of the dice if you will have a good or bad experience."}
{"text":"What a great place.
The food was awesome.. Try the sweet potato pancakes, they are like candy and melt in your mouth.

The wait staff is very fast, highly attentive, and VERY VERY FRIENDLY..

This restaurant is on my favorite list for breakfasts..  If they were closer to where I  live, id gain 20 pounds eating there daily.  Prices are good too.

Go, experience, enjoy. 

Marlene and Art run the  restaurant, and  they hand pick the nicest staff... 
To ensure a pleasant experience.

I am very candid with my reviews and have no problems giving a 1 star when warranted..  Biscuits Cafe has earned 5 Stars with ease."}
{"text":"I gotta say, my initial impression of this place wasn't a good one. We walked in just after noon and found only 2 other tables in the entire place to be occupied. Then when we got seated, we had a super weird start where we basically got juggled around with 3 separate waiters/waitresses coming up to our table. Luckily, it was smooth sailing after that and I was extremely surprised with Biscuits Café.

The restaurant itself is located on the SE corner of Sahara & Durango. Inside, they've got a really big, spacious dining room and they seem to be doing a great job of keeping it clean and organized. Instead of getting too into detail on what it looks like, I'll shamelessly plug my first opportunity to try out the Yelp video function. ;) *Although you might have to go to the business photos on the mobile app to find it*

As far as the food goes, they have a fairly large menu with choices for both breakfast and lunch. I ended up going with the Zesty Chorizo omelette and was really impressed. The chorizo was cooked perfectly, had great flavor and just the right amount of spicy heat. All the other ingredients were fresh and aside from tasting great, the portions are huge. They literally put what looked to be an entire avocado inside the omelette and it's served with a side of your choice, and biscuits. The salsa appeared to be fresh made and was easily one of the best I've had in a breakfast joint. My only complaint on my plate would be the potatoes. They were cooked well and also served as a huge portion, but they were lacking in salt. If I were to order this omelette again though, I'd ask for extra cheese. 

Now, with a name like Biscuits Café...they better have some good biscuits! Were they the best I've ever had? Probably not. But they are solid and in my opinion, far superior to what you'll find in most other restaurants in town. Buttery, flaky and served with both fresh butter and jam. You can tell they are fresh made every day and even though I'm not usually one to get biscuits for breakfast, I'd make sure to get one every time I'm here. Biscuits and gravy fans will love the version here.

Aside from the weird start, the customer service is great too. I could be wrong, but it looks like a family run joint and even if they aren't, you can tell they put a lot of love into their food. As others have mentioned, it's only a matter of time before this place starts getting busy and you're waiting for a table. It may have started off bad and a dead restaurant at peak times, is almost always a red flag...but Biscuits Café is serving up huge portions of killer food at great prices, and I'll happily be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"This cafe was amazing!! Wow!! Never been here before and came with my dad right before it got busy at 10am. The atmosphere was really pretty but we got sat under a fan and were freezing the whole time. The only con about this place was that our food took like 20 minutes but it was really packed and it was a Sunday. YOU HAVE TO GET THE CINNAMON ROLL FRENCH TOAST OMG it was SPECTACULAR!! I usually always get pancakes at breakfast places because I prefer my mom's homemade french toast, but this beat it out of the park!! They are popular for their cinnamon rolls but you gotta get the french toast form of it! Overall great place but took a long time for food. Would go back 10/10!!!"}
{"text":"Fast and fresh breakfast! I like the simple things for breakfast sometimes and they do a great job at it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! The cinnamon roll french toast and meat lovers omelette are top notch! Biscuts and fresh jam are terrific."}
{"text":"Just a block away from our apartment, decided to check it out.  Greeted quickly, seated in a clean booth, coffee and water delivered, coffee was quite nice.  Server was knowledgeable of menu which was great, also very friendly.  
I had a western scramble, with red potatoes and pancakes.  Meal was delicious and it was served with a few small tortillas which was unexpected but loved them.  Pancakes were also yummy.  Coffee refills were coming around frequently which was nice.
Only thing I would recommend was that the manager should spend more time table touching or checking on the customers instead of micro managing her staff.  She walked by our table 9 times but could not be bothered checking on us or even making eye contact.  Only saw her smile once when she was called to a table for a complaint."}
{"text":"What nice surprise,  the food was fresh and hot out of the kitchen.  May breakfast came with the best strawberry preserve,  my wife had Marion Barry preserve which was equally as good, and homemade.. A really nice place, very clean, would recommend to anyone that wants to try something a little different."}
{"text":"Went here on a day off mid week for a good brunchin'. I got the veggie omelette (minus the cream cheese) with the hash browns and side of fruit. Had to get coffee too , of course. The omelette was huge and very tasty. The hash browns were nice and crispy but a little too greasy for my liking. The coffee, however, was super yummy! Bonus.....the patio is dog friendly! Wish I knew that before I left my pup at home"}
{"text":"This is a it is a great place for breakfast. First, the establishment is clean and warming. It has easy access right off of the 101. Plenty of seating to house larger groups and the staff are super attentive. I ordered the standard fare for me: eggs, sausage, Toast and Hashbrowns. 

Here is the really good part. They use a fabulous sausage link, 2 ounces and big! Not that Seinfeld, George in the pool episode! The food is fresh and it was prepared perfectly. My server who's name escapes me, was dialed in. Her manager should pat her on the back. She's a keeper! Check this place out if you are near the Westside! Weekends can be quite the wait, so get in early!

{"text":"When we got there parking was a nightmare.  We were seated right away,  that was awesome.  However,  the service is not that great. Our waitress didn't do anything that stood out,  she was boring and had no personality.  I say this because the food was good.  I enjoyed my brisket Benedict  was awesome.  I think this place deserves a real wait staff, that's attentive,  suggestive,  and more excited.  The prices are a touch higher than they should be, so your tip will reflect that,  therefore,  a much better wait staff is needed.  I give the service a 1 star,  but the food,  an easy 4 out 5.  So 3 stars, is generous."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place!  Portions were big, food was tasty. Definitely would go back! Staff was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu."}
{"text":"My daughter and I sat outside on the patio which was lovely. We both ordered the Avocado toast .  DELICIOUS!!!!  Our server was so sweet and attentive.   Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this new brunch spot.  Finally tried it and it's my new favorite!  Very friendly staff and yummy food!  I love their biscuits and their homemade strawberry jam is to die for.  Haven't had a meal I didn't like yet.  The only thing I did not like was the giant glob of butter served on the cinnamon roll.  This is personal preference though, so I certainly do not fault for that!"}
{"text":"Very good food, nice ambience and good service. Went there for breakfast on a whim one day and was not disappointed. The biscuits were delicious, as was everything else on my plate. I sat in a corner so it wasn't excessively noisy but there are a lot of middle of the room tables that are right next to each other as well. Multiple servers stopped by my table to refill my drink. All were kind and quick. Nice place."}
{"text":"Nothing is worse than getting ripped off for low quality food. This location of Biscuits ripped us off this morning!  I ordered a scramble with red potatoes as a side, and the dish tasted as if it was warmed in a microwave or maybe sat under heat lamps for 10 minutes? Eggs had an aged taste of them and a slight curry-ish flavor or something bizarre. Not sure what a cook does to eggs to make them taste this way... and I don't really WANT to know either. Absolutely disgusting. I don't think the curry flavor was actually intentional. Biscuits are tiny and miserly, especially for a place named... well, you've seen it before. And the bill was $45.00 for three breakfasts and low end, flavorless 7-11 coffee and creamer from Sam's Club? Come on. Worst quality and most ridiculously overpriced breakfast I've had in decades! This place is an embarrassing joke."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast for our first time to the Cafe. Food was excellent as was the service"}
{"text":"A group of 7 of us went for a birthday breakfast this past Saturday and we got right in for a table. Service was friendly and good! I had the Two Eggs Your Way with Bacon and then also split biscuits and gravy with someone else. Portion sizes were great and you could easily share something. If I'm back on that side of town I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for breakfast since we were heading to Chandler. We arrived about 10am on Saturday and while it was busy we got seated right away. I had the chipped beef w/2 eggs over easy, crispy hashbrown and two biscuits. I had decided to go outside of my box with this order. When it arrived my eggs were over cooked as my yolk wasn't runny at all and that is my favorite part. I was expecting some gravy over the chipped beef as it was a tad dry without it so I asked for a side of that which definitely helped. The hashbrowns were cooked crispy like I like but the best part of my breakfast was the two biscuits that I put gravy on one and the jam on the other. My boyfriend ordered the waffles with sausage links. He said it was good but I could tell it didn't stand out like other places. Service was very good but I think we will try other options around the valley before really coming back."}
{"text":"I went to Biscuits Cafe today after passing it several times and wanting to try it. I decided to go with friends this morning and was super excited about it. 

I ordered my favorite breakfast choice, biscuits with gravy. I became immediately disappointed after taking my first bite. The biscuit tasted horrible and the gravy was just so-so. I couldn't believe it. With a name like biscuits cafe, I through their biscuits would be, well fantastic. 

One of my friends had a breakfast burrito and did not care for that either. The sweet potato pancakes were good though as was our service."}
{"text":"Biscuits were great the gravy was just okay but the service and red potatoes were excellent."}
{"text":"Great food service sucks 1 waiting for food drinks Etc...... I'll be back because food is good but be willing to wait"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast. Large menu and quite a number of choices. Food was okay, service was  good. A little pricey. We'll probably return."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place!!  The waffles and bacon are crispy and the juice is always fresh and cold."}
{"text":"Big portions, good flavor, great prompt service, great price.  Pancakes  than IHOP, waffles better than Waffle House, French toast better than...making it yourself.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Panera prices, without the Panera taste!  If you like bland, mushy food, this is the place for you!  Its called salt, and they should probably put some in the kitchen.  Service wasn't bad, but the food was.

I had the Avocado Toast, which was soggy and somehow bland.  The basted eggs were, you guessed it, bland.  With a heavy dose of salt and pepper it was edible, but I certainly wouldn't say two pieces of soggy avocado toast and two basted eggs was worth $9.50.  

We also had a $5 doughy and bland cinnamon roll which was covered in a fairly sweet, but bland cream cheese icing.  

She had the breakfast burrito with ham ($12), which had a lot of grizzle in it, barely any egg, and wasn't toasted on the flat top after being assembled.  

Basically this is cheap cafeteria food, at good food prices and we were VERY disappointed."}
{"text":"Food here really sucks. Eggs like rubber, hash browns unlike potatoes, fruit like frozen w/sugar added, biscuits hard and gravy s/be dumped over all of it. Huge disappointment"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I had a delicious meal! Yum! The service was nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I was shocked that Las Vegas even had a Biscuits Cafe.....because we have a couple in AZ and I thought it was only in Oregon....AZ and Washington. So imagine my excitement when I found out one was here and my wife could use her 5 buck Birthday Certificate for our entire meal. We have not been to Biscuits in years because with us being VEGANS there was nothing there we could really have. However upon looking at the menu when we arrived out here......we found that they actually do have a couple of items that are VEGAN. We ordered the Veggie Wrap which comes with your choice of hasbrowns or Red potatoes. While neither item was seasoned very well.....we fixed that issue with some salt....hot sauce....and ketchup....LOL!!!!! 

The Customer Service was awesome.....the establishment was very clean.....and location was very easy to access. I would honestly only come here if I had a coupon or gift certificate to use but all in all it was a very good experience. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a local in Vegas but visit family frequently throughout the year and this is my go-to breakfast spot every time! The biscuits and gravy are to die for and everything I've tried on the breakfast menu has been A1 so far  staff is quick, courteous, and have great personalities. I always have the pleasure of sitting in Gloría's section where she takes really good care of us. Definitely a must if you're in Vegas and trying to have something outside the strip!"}
{"text":"As I read the reviews, I didn't encounter any of those things that were posted, the greeting was nice, sat immediately and took my drink order ... Also inquired about WIFI.. Yes they have it.. My BLTA was great.. Definitely would come back ."}
{"text":"The only quick part of my meal was the bus boy asking if I was finished-my plate half-full of food, my fork in my hand, and still chewing the last bite I had taken. I had to get someone's attention to be sat, I waited nearly 10 minutes to place an order, and I finally had to go up to the cashier with no check. When I expressed my disappointment in my first visit, I was told, \"That's too bad. I hope we see you back again.\"  Yeah, that's not likely."}
{"text":"My friend insisted I go to biscuits to give it a try.  I decided to have the chorizo omelette with avocado and cheese.  The omelette came with onions and mushrooms which I asked to remove and it was missing the avacado.  I also had a large orange juice and a side of gravy to go with my biscuits.  Total was $19 which I thought was a bit high.  Food was average.

Service however was great and had enough extremely friendly server."}
{"text":"It was pretty busy so we thought it was going to be amazing. It turned out that the service was horrible and the food was mediocre. The server was Kathryn. She must have been having a bad day because she kept rolling her eyes! Unbelievable. 
I liked how they had condiments on the table. Tabasco and Cholula. The atmosphere was loud. It was OK. Not somewhere I'd go back to. 
We all ordered something different. The ham Benedict was good. The ham was cooked to perfection but the Hollandaise sauce was too greasy. The Pancakes from what I hear we're delicious. 
I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"Great place, but they are PERMANENTLY CLOSED!! Sorry for the bad news. We went today to closed doors and a sign saying they are closed"}
{"text":"I came here specifically for the sweet potato pancakes. I have been searching high & low for a breakfast place in Phoenix with these babies!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious again. We came rather early so wasnt packed. I like the food here. I like the location in proximity to my house however I wish patio was a little more serene. They cant help that so I just choose to come early and sit inside. I like their pancakes but also their lunch items."}
{"text":"Man, do I love a good breakfast spot. Biscuits Cafe, you are a good breakfast spot.

My dining experience at BC was a home run. My only regret was that I did not try the coffee which would have made my review complete. I will definitely have to go back and include an addendum.

A colleague of mine and I hit up BC for a quick bite while on lunch break. When we walked in I quickly noticed the place felt fresh. All of the decor was simplistic, clean and appeared new. I was very surprised at how big the restaurant was as well. We were quickly greeted by one of the smiling waitresses and seated. I opted for the Country Benedict and my colleague went for the Chicken Fried Chicken. When our entrees arrived I could not believe the portion sizes that were heaved onto our plates! There was probably enough gravy on my plate to fill my water cup. No complaints here! The quality of the food was par for my expectations and my colleague's as well, and the price seemed just right. The servers were also really on top of their game and not overly attentive.

Next time you're craving some breakfast, do yourself a favor. Skip Denny's and IHOP and give Biscuits Cafe a shot."}
{"text":"Ugh, so disappointed. Just tried this place for the first time. We have a 2 year old son and it's not easy to go out to eat with him so we ordered breakfast to go. We had a rough morning walking out to a dead car battery and had a hectic morning. So when we got home without our full order of food, I was upset, we called Biscuits Cafe to let them know we were missing an item and they told us to back come in and get it. We live 6 miles away from this restaurant, so it's not just down the street. My husband went to the restruant and picked up the item, they didn't offer him anything complimentary for the inconvience nor did they even appoligize. This was the last thing we needed to deal with on top of our hectic morning. Unfortunately I will not be coming back here and I will not be recommending this place whatsoever.  $35 for a cold breakfast... Beyond disappointing."}
{"text":"Service was great. Waitress was very attentive. Food was not very good... so bad in fact I did basically nothing more than taste test: coffe=bitter, gravy on biscuits=tasted like flour paste and pepper, Biscuits=hockey pucks (mine were better when I was 12). Bacon=burnt AND raw..... waitress.. very sweet... very good.. manager insisted \"I had bad taste\", this was the \" best food she had ever had\"...( poor woman.) AND  she expected me to still pay full price for 2 sips of coffee and 2 bites of biscuits/gravy, zero of the bacon...sigh... great location... but for a fairly new place, only open part of the day, it could also have been cleaner... placed had greasy floor/corners and the lovely scent of dirty mop water. Would not try unless you and your grandma are bad cooks and cover taste with coarsely ground pepper."}
{"text":"This review is completely about the service we received. Our server, Melissa, was kind and professional. She made sure our service was great and the food was cooked to order. At one point, she got sat with 5 tables at once. She greeted them all within a reasonable time and never forgot about us. I will request her as a server from now on."}
{"text":"Came and had breakfast with the hubs and baby before heading to the pumpkin patch. Service was quick and friendly. Tried the homemade corned beef hash which wasn't bad but a bit salty. Having the over easy eggs and added hot sauce helped. Hubs tried the biscuits and gravy because I feel like you have to and he said they were good, not as good as my homemade ones, sorry! They charge for refills of coffee so I was really disappointed with that since a small cup ended up coming to almost $3 each. For black decaf, that seems excessive. With so many other breakfast places in our area, not sure if we'd swing by again."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Limp Bizkit - Break Stuff)

Its just one of those cafes 
When you want to order coffee to wake up
Everybody's ready for brunch

You don't really know why
But you want to justify
Eating a big breakfast!

Add ketchup with eggs
You don't have time to interact
Your mouths full of jelly smacks

Your best bet is to keep coming this way, Yelpers
It's just one of those cafes!!

Biscuits Cafe is definitely one of those cafes; once you wake up to after a night out.  A night out with Jack, Jose, Sam Adams that is - wink!

Needless to say, Biscuits Cafe is a breakfast and brunch joint that serves up some wholesome breakfast mom used to make.  If you were born in the 50's and your mother actually cooked 3 main meals a day!  As that is now gone, Biscuits Cafe is probably one of the few closest place that brings that to life.  Welcome to the 21st century and I'm not talking about the insurance business! 

I ordered their Chicken Fried Steak and guess what else it came with?  Bacon, hash browns, scrambled eggs, and pancakes!  Wowza!  I'm a quality guy and not so much a quantity so this was too much food.  I nibbled around and my Chicken Fried Steak wasn't too bad.  The gravy a top was nice and creamy and kept it warm.  The bacon was crispy and the hash browns were too.  The pancakes, well they were dry.  In the end, the entire meal was pretty dry aside from my gravy. 

Overall, it was a nice experience and I rather enjoy long breakfasts with friends. The place itself is like an old school diner and service was good. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We have frequented Biscuit's Cafe many times and found the breakfast to be very good. My wife loves their sweet potato pancakes, or when available, their seasonal pumpkin pie pancakes. My favorite are the omelets (Greek or Country) served with link sausage. They also have a \"Keeping It Simple\" selection on the menu that gives you a choice of any 3 items (out of over 20 items). Service has always been good but can slow when crowded."}
{"text":"Food was bland.. service terrible..  I get better service at McDonald's..  our waitress was to busy to be bothered to stop her conversations with her friends to check on us.. and she couldn't care less when the food wasn't satisfactory... Hostess didn't if inquire about our visit.. will not be back.."}
{"text":"Ordered Country Omelette It Was Delicious! It Was Covered In Gravy And Accompanied By Red Potatoes And Pancakes. Portions Were Larger Than Anticipated Which Is Always A Plus. Service Was Efficient And With A Smile"}
{"text":"I gave three stars because I hope the bad experience my wife and I had was unique and rare: Table hadn't been wiped down before we were seated. Utensils and napkins were dirty and we were given a new set that were also dirty. Turns out something had spilled (syrup?) into the bin of fresh napkins and utensils which we had to point out before getting a clean set. I ordered the Black Oak Kielbasa with 2 over easy eggs, biscuits  and red potatoes. The biscuits are good... but kinda small? They are tall but not very large in diameter leaving little surface area to spread butter onto. They are baked to a perfect golden brown but resembled store-bought in regards to size. I guess this really disappointed me since the name of the place is what brought us in. (I assumed a place called \"Biscuits\" would have yuge biscuits.) They are served with a good red fruity berry sauce to dip or spread that actually goes perfect and balanced the rich and salty sausage. As for the sausage, the bottom half of the Kielbasa was cold... Like it had been taken out of the refrigerator and cooked on the flattop on only one side for only a few minutes. One of the yolks was cooked to medium which is weird. The potatoes were good and cooked proper with herbs and spice. My wife ordered the Ortega Chilies & Jack Cheese Classic Burger. The meat was cooked to death. Dry. Waitress did not ask for preparedness and we failed to specify, but it's basically burnt. The sandwich itself fell apart easy because it was so dry. The fries were pretty standard and prepared well."}
{"text":"Service was okay, but not spectacular.  Had mixed views on food.  Food also seemed pricey, though portions were fairly large.

Went in with my husband for lunch.  We were seated and served quickly but service was just okay, not special...i.e., no warm greeting, no smiles, etc...just the bare minimum was done to keep it from being bad service.  Our view on food was mixed.  I got the biscuit and gravy plate with bacon and scrambled eggs.  I tried the eggs first and found they really tasted like bacon.  So either they were cooked right next to the bacon on the grill, or the cooks use bacon grease to cook the eggs.  Lol.  Either way it was weird.  The biscuit seemed small and was covered in room temperature gravy, not the best.  I wished the gravy was warmer and the biscuit was fresher.  The bacon was good, thick cut, and cooked to my liking.  It was the best part of the meal.  My hubby thought his California club sandwich was excellent, super fresh, and tasty.  It really did look delicious and had me wishing I'd ordered it too.  His potato salad was your basic salad.  We both had sodas to drink.  The tab was just over $30, including tip.

Overall, I'm giving it a 3-star review since it was a mixed bag for us.  My husband really enjoyed his food.  My food was filling but nothing to write home about.  We'll likely be back since it's nearby.  Will update if our views change."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! We all know it as the place where the dog place use to be ;) AKA Biscuits. They have excellent service, it's super clean, food comes fast and it's a lot for your $$. We went in the second day it was opened and we left full, happy and ready for a mid morning nap. Take my advice and try this place."}
{"text":"So so..won't go out of my way to come here again. Coffee was OK..got the French Toast with eggs and sausage. Sausage patties looked like they were microwaved and we're dry, my daughter's potatoes were cold. French Toast was the best part of the meal ."}
{"text":"Absolutely great spot for business breakfast. Much better than the egg and I.  The country omelette smothered in gravy was delicious and the hashbrowns were nice and crisp. Service was friendly and attentive. Will be back soon and many times"}
{"text":"So yummy! I had the almond crusted French toast and my girlfriend had the apple sausage breakfast combo. The French toast was so good! A new spin on the classic favorite. The bacon was delicious and thick cut. Her sausage was tasty and the biscuit and jelly were really good! I'm glad it opened and is just around the corner from the house. Everyone was super friendly and the owners came by to say hi as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chicken fajita omelette and the best bacon I've ever had! By far the best breakfast place in AZ so far! Not greasy, healthy options, and giant portions!!"}
{"text":"After searching for a great breakfast place I thought I finally found one.  The restaurant was clean and quite quaint.  The servers were pleasant.  The menu offered a nice assortment of items although very pricy for breakfast.   The server was nice and coffee came out fast. We ordered and waited for sadly a cold meal.   Side note the biscuit were hot a pretty good.   This was there second week open. We will try them again in a month or two."}
{"text":"Stick with the biscuits if you go. While I enjoyed my food (eggs, bacon, sliced tomatoes, and biscuit), my date's meat-lover's omelet was a disappointment. There was a TON of meat in it, about a tablespoon of cheese, and a slice of processed cheese on top. Processed cheese! The omelet kept falling apart because it appeared they had cooked the egg as a tortilla and then filled it with ingredients; nothing would stay in.

The service was good, and our waitress checked on us a few times. She was pushing the cinnamon rolls, but for the price, they didn't look very tasty. 

My date raved about the jam, which appeared to be homemade since they sold jars to go."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Portions are huge and the food is always on point. Friendly staff and they also have a rewards program!"}
{"text":"Well we have been here twice.  The service was slow and food was cold.  May have the most uncomfortable seats for seniors I have ever sat in.   Will not return"}
{"text":"They shouldn't have the word \"biscuit\" in their name...

For a place that calls themselves Biscuit Cafe, you would think they would have some great biscuits... Or at least some freshly made and unique biscuits... Maybe because it was drowned in gravy, but it honestly felt and tasted like a generic biscuit that was purchased in bulk. 

Among having a generic biscuit, the gravy & sausage links I had was a tad too salty. The crispy house potatoes weren't bad. 

I wouldn't say I left mad and upset, just disappointed. 2 stars seems more than fair for my experience. No need for me to go back again in hopes of having a better meal."}
{"text":"Ben eating here since they opened ! Had out of town guests and had great memories here till today. Ham was cold on breakfast and wrong toast brought to table. For a place called biscuits don't order any ! They're small dry ,tasteless and just not worth the effort. Omelet wasn't much better. Bummed I guess I will be on the look for another place for breakfast. Feeling disappointed and bummed. Wondering what caused the change in quality of the food !"}
{"text":"If this could have zero stars it would. Server was very nice and friendly but as I finished my meal and was packing it up to take home for my doggies I noticed green spots on the bottom of my biscuit. Little specks all over. It was moldy, the biscuit I had been eating was molding on the bottom. I wrapped it up quietly to take inside and show the man running the cards. He held it up, felt the spots, wadded It back up and threw it away and said \"that's weird and definitely doesn't look right, hmmm\". Then proceeded to say \"want me to split the check in both cards?\" He didn't give a hoot and was so un-bothered by the fact I just ate a MOLDY biscuit they just served me. Never going back. EVER."}
{"text":"Very nice place! Good food, friendly staff. I was really impressed by it. It's a lot more nicer than a Denny's or IHOP for sure when it comes to breakfast. Very clean as well. They had vegetarian options for me which is great and something I look for in a place. Overall, will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Awesome service from Diana and great food! Pancakes tasted like cake! So yummy!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is like a half mile from our house and we finally got around to trying it.  Impressive menu and the place is bigger than it looks from the road. Chicken fried steak and eggs were great and the service was friendly and very attentive. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome Florentine eggs benedict!!! Service was adequate but not overly attentive... it was way too freaking hot to even contemplate the patio today but in cooler months this would be an awesome place to enjoy!!! I know it's weird but I wasn't looking for a mimosas or a Bloody Mary so I'm not sure they have that but that would make it even better!!! Yay!

You can pick up HUGE cinnamon rolls on the way out to take home and enjoy. They look amazing!"}
{"text":"I decided to take my boyfriend out for a nice Sunday breakfast at a nice little cafe around the corner from his house. We arrived a little after 11AM and had to wait about 15 minutes. Once we were seated, we noticed how cute the decor inside was and how many great choices the menu offers. I decided to get an omellete, red potatoes and biscuits and gravy. We waited about 15 minutes for food but everything that came out was good. Service was spotty but not complaining. I would come back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Just left Biscuits(Grand/Bell) ..love the food but we are thoroughly disappointed by the food prep.  Sat directly in front of toaster where a server was handling money, peoples water glasses and toasting everyones bread...ontop of eating her own food.  Not once but twice now.  Plus we didnt see any kitchen help using gloves. Needless to say i didnt eat my toast . I wanted to talk to management about this but he was standing next to server as she ate her sandwich and putting bread in the toaster.  Didn't think that would have done any good. Cant go back."}
{"text":"Oddly, the biscuits weren't all that great, but the gravy was good. It seemed like the biscuits were the kind of standard mass produced products that you would expect at at a supermarket. I like my biscuits toasted on top and I like them to have a taste and texture beyond bland spongy bread -- especially considering this is their signature food. The biscuits were rather small considering the price -- and the gravy wasn't hot. If I didn't know better the cafe used Pillsbury dough for their biscuits. Eeek!

Overall BC is a great  place to get a meal that tastes very homemade. The red potatoes are heavenly and the french toast is about the best I have had. The coffee was good too. 

The corned beef is good but I wouldn't recommend ordering this with red potatoes because the potatoes used to make the hash are very similar. You end up with a big plate of potatoes.

The eggs are disappointing. When I order two eggs I want two separate eggs, not one big round thing containing two egg yolks.

I came during off hours. The service was very good and friendly.

To me BC seemed sort of high priced, but the quality made the experience worth it."}
{"text":"Biscuits Cafe is probably one of the most underrated breakfast spots in town. I'm a fan of cinnamon rolls and a fan of French toast, so the cinnamon roll French toast ($10.99) was a marriage made in fat-kid heaven. Sweet, cinnamon filled, doughy and delicious, there's enough sweetness without being overpowering. The portion is large and included eggs and bacon. You'll probably skip lunch after eating it.

My kid's order of chocolate chip pancakes ($4.99) was obscene. Way more than any nine year old needs to eat. It's two large buttermilk pancakes full of Ghiardelli chips with whipped cream and chocolate syrup on top.

Service was a little slow even with the place nearly empty early in the morning. But, that was the only downside to our meal."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews we were hesitant about trying this place out. But we figured we try. Boy are we all glad we did.
We got there at 8:30 am on Sunday and we're seated immediately.  Our server brought water and offered coffee while we looked over the menue. Our order was taken and about 15 minutes later our food arrived. Everyone in our group got biscuits and graveyard and we all thoroughly enjoyed them. I thought the grave was very creamy with lots of flavor but wish it had bigger chunks of sausage. The biscuits were very good. Flakey and rich. The hash browns were crispy on the outside and not to soft on the inside with lots of buttery potato flavor.  The thick cut bacon was excellent  (nice that u get 3 pieces).
We all said that we will be back."}
{"text":"Service and food are both okay. My husband liked his roast beef dip, I thought my turkey sandwich lacked flavor. We'll go check it out again to give it another shot since it's in the area"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite place for breakfast. The patio area is very nice. I've never had to wait to eat even during peak breakfast/lunch hours. The waitresses are always extremely nice and helpful. I don't know what it is about the batter that they use to fry, but its delicious. I usually get the chicken fried steak (so good) and substitute my toast for some fruit; they give you a very substantial amount of fruit and they almost never add the $2 up charge to my bill, and if they did I wouldn't mind because they don't skimp and I know fruit can get expensive especially if substituting for bread.They also have a pretty good rewards program and when I was signing up they asked if I wanted to include any other family birthdays or special occasions to receive extra money off on those days. They definitely didn't have to do that. I've never left this place unhappy- only once were my eggs not cooked enough and she took them back immediately and replaced them with fresh ones. All in all, if you're looking for a good breakfast/lunch place I fully recommend Biscuits Cafe! (at least this location)"}
{"text":"After Harlow's down the road was so packed we couldn't park, we decided to give this new breakfast cafe a try.  The portions are extremely generous and overall the food was really good.  The prices are a little high I think, but not so much that I wouldn't return.  I knocked down a star because the ham I received was \"off\" and tasted like it was past it's shelf life, and the oj was just so-so.  They do give complimentary chocolate covered strawberries that are epic!"}
{"text":"Wonderful gluten free waffles!

It's a smaller cafe, so I always go off peak hours.

We always have a great waitress.

My husband goes with friends at least once a week if not more frequently.

Parking... it's a shopping center, so it is what it is.  The bank in the plaza has a fit even when they aren't open.  I wouldn't call it patio seating as only a few tables... they have some work to do there it's a nice try.

I like the decor and real maple syrup when you eat in.  When you get it to go, it's Mrs Butterworths."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast place. Had the meaty omelet with hash browns and pancakes. Nice portion size."}
{"text":"It was , nothing special. Had eggs that were cooked good, bacon that was bacon, the hash browns were cold and horrible I will say. Had the Apple Cinnamon French toast, it wasn't bad, sweet, good. The strawberry compote or jam was the best thing in my opinion. I also like that they had a variety of creamer. Coffee was your average diner cup of Joe. I would eat there again but not by my choice, just think that there are other places way better were this was average to poor. Clean and looks nice inside and service was good."}
{"text":"Always good but it's usually loud. Service is tricky since they're usually busy and have the weirdest division of tables (today our waitress had 4 tables seated at the same time on opposite ends of the restaurant). 
I've only been here for breakfast but the bacon slices are good!"}
{"text":"The pancakes at Biscuits are so great. The servers are always so friendly and personable. We did have to wait a little bit for a table but only because we arrived at prime breakfast time on a Saturday. So worth the wait though!!!"}
{"text":"A favorite breakfast spot on the West side of town. Food is really good and selection caters to healthy and happy. Always have tables available and staff are friendly. Place is big and spacey. Wish they would up their coffee game as that's the only thing not up to par!"}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast this morning around 10am and got seated right away. Good size restaurant and patio with casual atmosphere. Our server was Cathy and she was phenomenal! Very nice, constantly checking in with us, and always made sure our water, coffee, and creamers were full! 

Started off with coffee that was delicious and steaming hot! Served in a huge 12-14oz black mug. Good flavor with different kinds of creamer on the table to choose from. For my meal I got the 3 pancakes with fresh strawberries and whip cream. It's was delicious! The strawberries were very fresh and sweet. The pancake itself was huge, thick, and fluffy. 

I got bacon on the side as well. Came with 4 large slices of bacon Very Crispy. I love my bacon crispy so it was perfect but if you like it a little under done make sure to request it and they are happy to accommodate(they did it for my friend)! 

Overall everything was great! Good food and awesome service. Looking forward to coming back and try something new."}
{"text":"Sorry to hear that this place is closed. I had good times here, and it was fairly consistently decent food, that was homey. But something was always a little bit off.  The service could be inconsistent, and the price was a little bit overpriced.  Biggest problem could have been the hours.  Oh, well, it is all moot now."}
{"text":"How unfortunate because the biscuits were tasty. We were seated within 15 min which was great. However, once we placed our order we waited for about 25min and realized that other patrons that had arrived at about the same time or after us, were already eating. The waitress realized and brought us the biscuits I mentioned earlier. However, after another 25 min,  we decided to cancel the order. The waitress felt bad, but by then we weren't hungry anymore. I just don't think it should take 25 minutes or worse 50 minutes, to make a biscuits omelette and a Greek omelette. Too bad because the food the other patrons did look decent. I should have asked for the manager, but not too keen on making big issues."}
{"text":"ARRIVED 1:10.  No greeting.  8 employees on the floor with 14 tables more than half done eating and leaving. What? More than 2 employees for every table, your kidding me.  Additional  5 employees sitting on break in dining room.  Order given, asked server (who is always friendly we get her alot) looks like u are the only server, she says yes it does... what are the other 7 doing?  Neglecting customers and dirty tables - l9ts of hanging around and talking.  NOTE:  we were not the only ones grumbling and shaking our heads as the SO OBVIOUS  lack of direction, leadership, organization, total disfunction.  By now 10 tables total in the dining room, at one point 6 needed to order WITH 14 employees on the floor.  Now maybe some were getting ready to go home but seriously who goes home when the dining room is dirty, in disarray, and customers are being neglected... leadership promotion of teamwork  NOT HERE... but to be expected by the middle aged hag of a general manager.  We were treated so rudely by this woman.  I am embarrassed for this restaurant to have such poor representation of management and leadership with one of those rude people who smile and say have a nice day with a lot of disgust and dismissal and keeps on walking away hiding behind that sarcastic have a nice day... like we all haven't seen that move before, no academy award for her performance... should be completely ashamed of herself for her unprofessional behavior  and shortness at her age she should know better, but based on the leadership that was nowhere to be seen it makes sense.   Our food arrived at 1:45.  Open kitchen showed a breakdown occurring and french fries were barely warm and soggy and chili not warm.  Food dumped on us server rushed off, no soda refill  (half empty) no extra napkins,  no check back... gosh 14 employees and thus server is buried.  Got up and walked food back to kitchen to be fixed myself.  10 minutes later new fries arrive on a tiny plate while eating sandwich off a napkin, no offer for another plate or napkins or refill.  Now fries are hot, but white and raw and our sandwiches are cold.  Wave server down to say, we don't want this food, in a disappointing way not rudely, she needs to get manager.  She arrived and the rest is history.  What's the problem.  Not a hello, my name is... we respond we don't want this food (sandwich has 2 bites so don't think anything else) we brought u new fries (ok, so u knew already we had an issue and said come on don't play that game) ya but they are raw we respond... ok, have a nice day... but she really meant ok, go F-OFF ... you'd have to be deaf and blind not to know what she meant.  And she abruptly walks away, our reply you are being rude... HAVE A NICE DAY as she runs her passive aggressive poor excuse of a manager self back to hide in the kitchen where she was planted from the time we arrived.

Not the first time we had a poor experience but the last.  DON'T GO HERE!  and if you do, tell the manager she should be in uniform not her ugly street clothes she always wears.  Tell the young blonde we don't need cleavage in our face it's vegas yes but this is a breakfast joint not Hooters.  Tell the cashier that you are suppose to smile and walk faster than my 90 year old grandmother in a walker.  

No wonder this place sits half empty at all hours when other places have a line out the door.  ONE REASON ONLY - YOUR GENERAL MANAGER.  With 25 yrs food and beverage experience, we speak with experience.  

Watch your camera footage and pull labor reports if you don't believe me.  Shame on you for treating  us this way and ruining Father's day.  Hope u r proud of yourself."}
{"text":"Let just say I wouldn't go here if you want a light breakfast, very heavy food, kinda made me sick"}
{"text":"Love the food, and the service is fast and friendly. Restaurant is always clean and on top of things. Delicious biscuits and u have to have the raspberry jam."}
{"text":"Solid menu. Best Hash Browns, Gravy. I am not usually a biscuits and gravy guy but I had to try and have had breakfast combos that included that ever since. The name and brick and mortar appearance are deceiving, i drove past this place 30 times before I stopped. I get the Chicken Fried Chicken or Chicken fried Steak."}
{"text":"Busy Sunday morning and only had to wait about 10 minutes. Really quick service & the food was amazing!! The biscuits & strawberry jam were my absolute favorite part of the meal. The Orange juice taste so fresh! I love the fact that they serve flavored creamer for the coffee. Our server was very nice & helpful."}
{"text":"Amazing! The Veggie Head omelette was delicious, the cute hostess was professional and seated us fast! The manager Kelly was nearby helping another customer and went out of her way to make their day special. This is a fantastic breakfast and brunch spot with a small town feel. I have been here a handful of times and even though I am not a regular they always remember my husband and I. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Meh. Wife loves biscuits and gravy so we decided to try it out. Service was good but food was not. Both of our eggs were flavorless. Bacon was like cardboard. Our mugs were dirty and my wife wiped hers off with a napkin and left the napkin brown. Will not be back. Plenty of better spots to go."}
{"text":"A while back this place showed up on a search in my neighborhood for new breakfast places and I bookmarked it noting it would have to be a place I went to when not opening until 6;30 would be OK.

I was the only customer in the place until just before I finished.  Kelly, my server was pleasant and the only problem was she gave me a couple of minutes to look over the menu which turned into about 5 because she was chatting with the manager who was in my line of sight as I set down the menu and started playing with my phone. The remainder of the service was good.

The food was good with one exception. Two cooks, one customer and the timing of the plating was off. They serve toast with soft butter on the side and the toast was stone cold and even though I spread the butter immediately it never did melt in to the bread. Now that I know I may ask them to butter it right out of the toaster next time.

I prefer sitting in a chair at a table and the whole restaurant is set up that way. Sort of like not having a bad seat in the house. :) It is obviously a chain but I liked it and will probably go back again to try a couple of the other items that looked good on the menu.

3.49 stars"}
{"text":"Me, the Corned Beef Hash plate and the Mrs. the Biscuits and Gravy all the way!

Cubed red potatoes is the only way to go and the bacon was just right, not too thin and not too thick - And the mug of coffee was huge!

We were hungry and found what we wish there were more of!  A place with a wonderful menu and excellent service that when you left, you felt full!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Waited 20 min for a watery so called veggie omelette promised with fresh veggies and berries and whipped cream. The omelette was flavorless and the veggies were literally bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes! And no cream cheese. The berries were a soup of nasty crushed up waffle topping with a sad dollop of whipped cream for $4! So dissapointed."}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 people..this was my first time here ..it took a little time for all of us to show up.. the service was a little slow..I had to ask for eating  utensils ..but what got me the most was them asking us to leave after we have eaten ..they were polite about it but really..don't think I will be back..the food was OK not great.."}
{"text":"First time here. We arrived early, about 7:30am. It was still nice enough so we sat outside. I tried the biscuits and gravy. It was very good. Have a feling they may be heated in the microwave though as my biscuit got a little hard as it sat on the plate. The gravy was good and plentiful. Husband said the coffee was excellent. Our waitress was good, but didnt come by often enough. 
We'll go back to try it again."}
{"text":"Ants, LONG food prep times, undercooked food time and time again... I , really wanted to LOVE this place.  Home style cooking right here in our Chandler neighborhood.  Such a disappointment. We haven't just gone once or twice we have given this conveniently located restaurant MANY times to rise above our last experiences ..and each time it just gets worse :(. I love Chicken Fried Steak and they have delivered but I ask for red potatoes with them and when they arrive at least 35-45 min later which is soooooooo long(the server always apologizes on the cooks behalf) my two eggs each time ( asked over hard) are runny and my potatoes are Crunchy!!!! Ew. We have sent them back and been patient time and time again. When you sit outside they don't clean all debris off the tables properly and it is often sticky... so, ANTS will join you during your breakfast.  I have seen the reviews on this restaurant and wanted to be able to justify all the insubordination.. I just can't."}
{"text":"Highly recommend... The food is delicious and very fresh. We only waited about 10 minutes on a packed Sunday morning and no one was rushed. Nikki is an AMAZING server. She was friendly, fun, and actually took the time to talk to us. And she was like that with all her patrons. She is an asset to this establishment and I want to go back for the food AND her. Love this place."}
{"text":"Grabbed breakfast here with a friend. I got the turkey & veggie scrambler. The food and service were good and the inside if the restaurant was nice. I probably would have given 4 stars, the reason I'm only giving 3 is because I was blown away by how expensive it was when I got my bill. I did substitute berries for potatoes as my side but still it was $22 (over $25 with the tip) for a plate of eggs and a cup of coffee. I mean this is just a diner, typical denny's/ihop type food - nothing special. Good but not that good."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before, as well as at other locations for this chain.  Blah.  \"Friendly\" but poor customer service from the time I walk in the door and have to wait to be seated (when they are only 20% ful at the height of lunch hour), to getting water brought to the table, to the waitress not understanding I wanted \"kielbasa and scrambled eggs\" not a \"kielbasa scramble\".  And then the food was only \"blah\", even their signature biscuits- a little over done . . . what a shame.  This part of Surprise is really humming.  Loads and loads of retail business with full parking lots all around.  Yet this Biscuit's Cafe struggles along - due solely to management's tolerance of far-less-than-stellar customer service."}
{"text":"Our 3rd visit. I picked this place for a Mother's Day outing. Bad choice. Service was not great, food tasted as if it was sitting there pre cooked and warmed in the microwave. Waitresses looked like they were run over by a truck so tired and walked around with frowns, dirty tables and floors..just felt dirty. Looks like they could use better management. Tea was good. We plan to not return. Expect more for the prices. Such a shame."}
{"text":"First time in and it was great.  Huge cup of coffee just what I needed to start my day. Scrambled eggs were perfect and my biscuits and gravy was amazing. Highly recommend.  Linda was our server.  Very nice quick with refills and very attentive.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time order through Postmates which is how I found this spot. Delivery guy said everyone looked happy inside and the bags are heavy! He had never heard of it before and he wanted to try it now too. We got 5 different items but this burrito was mine. And GOOOOOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Went here this morning.

The biscuits and gravy were just ok, the gravy was good, the biscuits were not light and fluffy. 

The blue berry pancakes were good. Who I had breakfast with said that the corn beef has was good. 

The service was just ok. 

The prices were high for the quality of food that you got. 

I won't say I won't return but it won't be my first or second pick more than likely."}
{"text":"I have eat here on many trips into town and will be my last!!! I went on a hike with two friends and after we decided to go here since they have never ate here.  They ordered breakfast and I had lunch.  My one friend ordered the one biscuit breakfast her eggs were cold her sausage patties were black,burned and dried out that a knife wouldn't cut them.  My other friend ordered a short stack that they over cooked one side and served them not even being able to cut.  Me well I ordered  BLT with avacodo and fries well how could you go wrong, well fries were cold and BLT was cold and bacon not cooked.  It was so bad and embarrassing that they had a bad experience there first time in.  I apologize to them and there response was its not your fault but we won't be coming back!!!!! And neither will I"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and was really disappointed with the food quality. The restaurant is very clean, the service was good....but the food was just weak. We got the breakfast burrito (with corned beef hash) and it was just okay. We also got eggs Benedict which was fine but nothing special. 

Food is kind of overpriced and we probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here today, and will not return. Apparently this is a local outpost of an Oregon chain. The waiter extolled the virtues of the house-made sausage gravy, the biscuits, and wonderful strawberry jam made in Oregon. We found the biscuits to be heavy, possibly under-baked, and the gravy to be grainy with too much flour. I had a blueberry pancake, which was, well, ordinary, with only a few blueberries. I should have known better than to order mixed berries in October, because they had been frozen and were thawed to unpleasant mush. We did not have occasion to try the strawberry jam. Prices are pretty high for such mediocre fare."}
{"text":"Will never be back!! The one star is for the food, it was good.... But just luke warm. Doesn't surprise me since the tables around us (that got here after us) got their food promptly. My mom ordered fresh fruit and what she got was a syrup covered berries that looked frozen. We asked the waitress and she was surprised she wanted the fresh fruit. She replaced the side of fruit with what was originally asked for, fresh fruit! After that she never came back to the table. Never asked how our food was. Never refilled waters. Nothing. She sure was attentive to the other tables. The service at this place is always lack-luster and I've tried giving them the benefit of the doubt since it was busy. But today was hardly busy. Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Nice place! Wait on a Saturday morning wasn't too long, like 10 mins.. Good coffee with flavored creamers in nice big mugs. 

I had the smoked brisket eggs benedict. The brisket was sliced niced and thin and smoked perfectly, it was also very tender. Their hollandaise sauce was a little bland for me but my wife loved it. She had the traditional ham benny with added avocado and she said it was great. 

I also had a side of one sweet potato pankake, never tasted that before,  it was yummy.  Wifey had a sweet cinnamon roll which I tasted. It was light and fluffy, very good taste and you could tell it was  real cream cheese icing on top.

Service was very good and the servers are super friendly. Linda was a pleasure. 

Prices are reasonable and the food is fresh and yummy, I would recommend this place. Afterwards, you can shoot up 59th and go to Hot Bagels and pick up a fresh dozen to take home. The best bagels in town. 

We will def come back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My husband and I brunched here after church today and we had a wonderful experience. We were sat in a timely manner and the food was delish! They definitely have the best biscuit and gravy I've ever had in Vegas. It's not salty not tastes less, but instead just right. 

They do however need to staff more servers because they place is starting to get really busy."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my breakfast very much at this location. I had 2 pancakes, 2 bacon strips, and 2 biscuits and gravy.  I was very, very happy with the food. Good orange juice, environment, service, etc. This place is a keeper no doubt!! (Mind you I went in on Friday morning at 7am so my review does not reflect the weekend service or food)"}
{"text":"The first few two times we ate here it was decent. But almost every time after that the service has been horrendous. I have found hair in my food and my husbands food and even found pieces of plastic in my grilled sandwich. It was appalling and the staff really didn't seem to care at all. Needless to say, my family and I do not visit this place anymore."}

{"text":"The staff is amazing and works well as a team. The food is great especially the sweet potato pancakes. They are so nice they even offer a drink to go. Fabulous place we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, but they need a hostess to sit people. I don't mind waiting for a table if it is crowded. But there were empty tables and and it was taking a long time to get seated. There was about 3 different groups the just left because it was taking to long.

{"text":"I have to be honest, I wasn't really expecting much when my husband suggested this place for breakfast, I was wrong!! Amazing customer service, the food was hot and fresh and delicious! Huge portions! I was definitely pleased with the place and will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews aren't as good as mine. I love their biscuits and gravy, their red potatoes are great too! Pricing is okay but even better when you order their \"Keep It Simple\" option where you choose 3 entree's/sides. I also like their reward system."}
{"text":"This place has been bookmarked for awhile. So I decided to stop by here for breakfast and was hesitant to try this breakfast place because of the mixed reviews of fellow Yelpers. However, I stumbled across Antonia M. review and she mentioned the best item is their Cinnamon Roll French Toast plate. By now, your probably wondering...why did Marlon got this particular item when clearly it's called Biscuits Cafe. First and foremost, I have a sweet tooth and anything cinnamon sugar is gonna get my attention. As my server Brenda took my order, she was very knowledgable with the menu and history of biscuits cafe. She made my visit a pleasant morning and was very attentive to my needs. Water cup was filled constantly and my black coffee with small amount of cream was filled a few times too!

Onto the my Cinnamon Roll French Toast, from presentation and to the very last bite was amazing! The French toast was soft in texture with a good amount of cinnamon flavor throughout. The best part was that it was moist and not dried out. It included your choice of eggs and bacon or sausage. Both side items were good along with the side of hash browns that I got to contrast with my French toast. I would definitely come back for this dish and to try out other items.

2017 Yelp Review #8"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday morning about 9AMish and the place was constantly busy but not the rush that we find at a place like this for breakfast on Sunday morning.  Easily seated and drinks ordered right away.  Wife really liked the scrambled eggs and my omelette was pretty darn good.  What surprised me most and I am liking it for it,  they had the Tabasco brand of Chipotle hot sauce on the table.  You usually have to ask for it or most do not carry it at all.  Reasonable prices quite outstanding attention to service although the food did take a little more time than other places.  If you have time to spare,  it is a good sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"No matter how packed this place is the service is always amazing! The wait times are never long and the staff is always busy making sure every table is taken care of!  Highly recommend. Even on the weekends,"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a Sunday. It get full pretty quickly. Service was great as for the food it was ok. It was just basic diner food.  I had the chicken and waffles and the Wifey had the country fried steak"}
{"text":"Food is good
Service is ok

This location is very busy and takes a very long time to get your food! Be aware when you come here! I don't recommend coming with kids ever! The hour wait at your table will not fair well. You will likely wait both before and even longer at your table."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is outstanding! My friend and I arrived here on a Sunday morning for breakfast and good conversation.   The place was already packed!  We waited about 15 minutes for a table.  

The atmosphere here is pretty good.  You have a choice of indoor or patio seating which I think is nice.  We sat inside as it was a scorcher. 

I ordered the corned beef hash and it was dynamite! Real corned beef. Not that mushy canned junk. This was the real deal all crispy and tender and delicious!!! My friend had the avocado benedict and was extremely pleased.  Of course we HAD to try the house made jam as it is wonderful!!! I also appreciate the good sized coffee mugs they use and no shortage of refills.  I need a constant flow of coffee in the morning and Biscuits delivers. 

My only complaint is the parking. There's just not enough for this amazing restaurant.   You may find yourself walking a little ways from car to restaurant...but you may need it after filling your belly with the tasty treats you'll find on this menu.  Mmm."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with the fam after church. Customer service was fantastic. We were greeted warmly and sat right away. Coffee and waters came out quickly.

I was a little taken a back by the prices, with the average being $10-11 bucks, but when the food came out I understood why...the portions are HUGE. My mom and I split a meal and we couldn't even finish it.

The food was pretty decent. I got the apple chicken sausage meal. I was excited for the sausage but it was pretty bland. Pancakes and eggs were good. Potatoes were greasy and chewy, Coffee was good. My sister got one of the specialty egg Benedict's and the whole plate was covered in gravy. Didn't look appealing to me but my sister said it tasted pretty good.

I didn't like that they charged us an extra $2.50 to share a plate.

Overall, it was a good experience. I also think the decor is cozy and adorable. Quality of the food could be taken up a notch or 2 though."}
{"text":"We found Biscuits Cafe (Biscuits with an 's' even though the Yelp page is singular) in an unassuming strip mall in front of Smart and Final.  I was not expecting much when we pulled up, but the exterior is misleading because once you step inside this place is large, bright, and airy.  I found it very refreshing.  We stopped by closer to lunch than breakfast, so the rush was over and we were seated right away.

We ordered the Smoked Brisket Benedict  $10.59 and the Joe's Scramble $10.49.  Both were eggs-cellent (haha).

The Benny comes with mesquite smoked brisket, English Muffin, 2 poached eggs, and hollandaise with a side of hashbrowns or red potatoes.  The brisket was fantastic- tender, moist, with rich flavor.  The hollandaise flavor fell a little flat, but was okay.  Hashbrowns, standard diner fare.

The scramble comes with FOUR eggs, spinach, onions, tomatoes, bacon, potatoes (in the scramble), and parm  on top.  This thing was massive and dense and all the flavors played well off each other.  But, man, it fills you up fast because it is so hearty!  I would likely 86 the potatoes in future.  They were unnecessary (IMO).  As if the dish itself were not large enough, this scramble comes with a side of biscuits, toast, or pancakes.  Since I'm obsessed with finding the perfect pancakes, I went for those and they were pretty darn good!  Fluffy with crispy edges.

We will definitely be back when venturing to the West Side."}
{"text":"Feeling a little under the weather this New Years Day, we ventured out to grab a bite... After driving by a few times and reading the reviews, we decided today was the day.. So glad we did!!! It's rare to browse a menu and want to try several things on the menu... But, we did and over ordered just to try some things out...  
We both ordered The Biscuits Burger.. This is a first for me... Hamburger, ham, bacon, cheese, egg, tomato, and onion..... Holy moly, this was super messy and delish!!  Our toddler ordered Mac & Cheese that came with a side of garlic toast. She LOVED it, and is super picky when it comes to Mac & cheese.. We also ordered the hash, very good, a biscuit to try their jam... Wow!  And instead of fries I ordered the pot roast soup...
The staff is very nice, the restaurant is very clean, and the food is very good.. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is timing of the food, and I will take partial responsibility... All the food came at once, including my soup...  Next time I will ask that my soup, and any extra items we order come out first..."}
{"text":"Was my first time eating here this morning and I have to say.. Our waitress was great! Very friendly and attentive. The food was great and they certainly do not skimp on anything! Big portions we had to wrap up. A great place for breakfast and definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I wish I'd has as good an experience as others with this cafe.  My bacon was burned and the coffee smelled and tasted burned as well.  This cafe is priced higher and the food quality is lower than other breakfast eateries in the area.  I certainly won't be back."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to Biscuits Cafe and the prior visits were pretty good.....food was really good. Today not so much.  We ordered a four egg meat omelette with red potatoes and pancakes to split.  We read on the menu there was a charge for splitting and we were good with that.  Waitress seemed annoyed from the second we asked to split the meal.  When the meal arrived the portions were much smaller by half than the previous times I've ordered it for myself. The potatoes were cold...not even warm.  When we questioned the portion size of the meal the waitress rudely replied, \"I don't know....it depends on who cooks it\". Then promptly walked not even allowing us to finish the conversation.  Needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"First visit to Biscuits. We got there about an hour after opening. The coffee was a
little on the strong side, but I could live with that, thanks to ice cubes and creamer.
The oatmeal was wonderful and my husband loved the potatoes. The one thing I
noticed most was the wait staff (the girls mostly). They just kinf of wandered around
with nothing to do and stood around and visited. We had the view of the kitchen
watching the kitchen staff going outside to smoke or on their cell phones.
What did we  ever do without cell phones, oh I know we worked, or at least looked around for something that needed attending to. Had the waitresses been asking diners if there was something they needed instead of just looking bored I would'nt have
mentioned it. Not sure I'll go back, a little too industrial."}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips and iced tea. Subbed onion rings for fries. Two of us split it because the waitress said it was a pretty good size. The food was good, but not 20.00 good. Iced tea is 3.00, which is ridiculous, but we are finding is becoming the norm around here. It was okay but I wouldn't go back mainly because it's way too overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"What a great find. Great food an amazing service... My husband an I saw this place while looking for new places to eat in our area but at the time it was closed. So we decided this morning to go there and have breakfast and try it out. We were so glad we did. I had the cinnamon roll french toast which was amazing and he had eggs benedict which was also very good. We also had a side of the biscuits and gravy which I thought were great. The service was exceptional, always making sure everything was okay and our coffee cups were full. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.  With It's great food and exceptional service we will definitely be regulars here. So if you haven't tried this place yet I definitely say go what are you waiting for."}
{"text":"We stopped in early on Sunday morning for breakfast. Service was great, but they weren't too busy at the time we were there. Jamie was our server and she was wonderful! 

The food was very good for the most part. We split a cinnamon roll, and I think it's the best I've ever had! Gooey, soft and with tons of delicious frosting. I would recommend this. I ordered the apple french toast which was delicious as well. I had it with scrambled eggs and sausage (links) per Jamie's recommendation. I was not disappointed! My husband had the biscuits and gravy combo. His only complaint was that the hash browns weren't seasoned at all. 

It's worth mentioning that they have a rewards program. I'll definitely be back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We went there after planing a baby shower with my wife and mother -in-law. I ordered the first item on the Menu. A Biscuit and Gravy meal. The service was friendly, but when they brought the food I thought I had taken a trip to pre-prepared land. My sausage links we cut in half and over cooked . My Hash browns were in a rectangle (frozen and reheated like that) and my eggs were over coked in a hard circle. The biggest issue was they forgot the biscuit and gravy. The waitress said it to me as a after thought before she left, \"did you have Biscuits and gravy?\" Yes! She came back in less than a minute a dropped a tiny biscuit with only a little gravy on a plate and rushed away. The food made me sick. 

HEALTH CODE VIOLATION!!
The worst part of the whole visit was the end. As we were waiting to pay at the register, we watched two waitresses rolling forks and knives in napkins while eating (we watched one dip a fry and ate it and then wrapped a napkin, greasy gross). That is so unsanitary and against health code. Do they not realize that their germs are being passed to the mouths of every guest? Never going back."}
{"text":"Very cool place !! Has misters out side  had a good breakfast   That's my review thank you for reading!!!!:)"}
{"text":"I am a corned beef hash guy and I know how hard it is to find good hash in a restaurant.  believe me, it's hard.  that being said, CBH is on the menu at Biscuits so I decided to try it.  let me also say that I rarely find that a restaurant's \"homemade\" CBH is anywhere close to as good as the stuff you can buy in the can.  Biscuits is no exception.  if all you want is a huge plate of food you will actually like Biscuits (in that respect it is very similar to hash house a go-go.  actually, both are equally poor on quality).  back to the CBH.  it's not really hash.  it's more like a pile of dried up shredded meat on top of some under-cooked, under-seasoned potatoes. truly gross.  after 2 bites I had had enough.  the server asked if I liked it and I said \"no\".  she laughed and asked if I wanted a box.  of course I said no.  I wouldn't feed it to my dog.  and, of course, she left it on the bill.  fair enough.  for that, I give my review and rating and promise to never set foot in the place again."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for a place in Surprise that finally has decent breakfast food. We've tried everywhere else and have always left disappointed. That was not the case when we went here yesterday. The cinnamon roll is out of this world! So good. The biscuits, contrary to many opinions on here, were actually very good; as was the gravy. Our server Carrie was amazing and the food came out quickly. The only downfall is that we felt it was a little pricy. Still, everything was good and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had in a very long time. The food was fresh and obviously prepared by caring hands. The staff and service was above and beyond. Watchi,g the staff interact with other patrons made me excited to make this a new regular stop. There are a lot of establishments in the area that could come by here and take some notes. Great job all around."}
{"text":"Short review:

It's an automatic fail when I come for breakfast and am there for at least 30 minutes and not once during that time did anyone come around to offer a coffee refill.  Not once.  

Longer review:

I saw Biscuits Cafe on Yelp and since it's close to home I decided I'd have to give it a go.  I wouldn't have ordered the biscuits and gravy combo but when in Rome... This is their signature, their biscuits.  The combo includes a choice of meat, I chose sausage, and two eggs any style.  I opted for over easy.

The order was done quickly.  I am not a connoisseur of biscuits and gravy.  In fact, I can't remember the last time I ordered this.  The biscuit was OK.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be house made but I'm pretty sure it wasn't.  There was nothing special about it.  The gravy was OK, too, with a hint of ground pepper.  I'm certainly glad I didn't order the breakfast with two biscuits.  The sausage was two links that were sliced horizontally and grilled.  The eggs were done over easy.

All in all, breakfast was OK.  I should have stuck with an omelette or Benedict--my usual go to breakfast dishes.  But, I'll never know what they're like because I won't be back.  

When I paid at the register, the woman asked for my member number.  When I told her I didn't have one, she asked me if I wanted to join their club.  My answer was a polite no.

People, when you have three servers covering about 7 tables, it's not hard to bring a carafe of coffee around and offer warm ups or refills.  It should be something you dream about at night.  If one of your two specialties is breakfast and you fail on service for that, there's not much hope for you."}
{"text":"For a place called biscuits you would think that they would be outstanding.  I ordered the two biscuit plate and it was not very good.  

The biscuits were small and the gravy was flavorless. I have had bigger and better tasting biscuits out of a can.  

I will not be returning here when I come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped over here for breakfast with my family on our way to a Spring Training game and when we pulled up i saw that there was a lot of people waiting so I figured this place must be good. Waited about 30 minutes for a table we got seated and our waitress was good she has our drinks to the table pretty fast and she was officiant with our order. I ordered the chicken fried chicken and it was really good the biscuits and gravy were excellent and you could tell that all the food was homemade. Everyone enjoyed their food the table was big the restaurant itself was decorated nice I highly recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We were Very disappointed! The Eggs were horrible, the pancakes bland.. Long wait for food, expensive.. On a good note-the bacon was good..Won't go back."}
{"text":"Large portions and good quality. Suggestion is to split a plate. Breakfast seems to be their specialty."}
{"text":"They old saying holds true.  Minimum wage earnings will give you minimum wage results. From watching the staff cough, sneeze...and not washing their hands once. . And the best I've never personally seen before. .staff is carrying food. Put there finger in the plate of food and LICK THEIR FINGER CLEAN AS THEY ARE CARRYING THE PLATE TO THE CUSTOMER!!! That's when i stopped eating.  Food was bland...potatoes boring and not seasoned.  I give this place 2 months at this pace. ..waste of time"}
{"text":"This makes me sad the food was not good. I've been here a few times and they must have a new cook. The service was excellent but the food was not good I had the Mexican egg scramble and it wasn't good I posted a picture of this nasty mess. Not sure if I will be back"}
{"text":"Sunday am breakfast   Excellent service from the minute we entered the door.  Server Amanda very attentive. Coffee hot and nice flavor they have flavored cream at the table which is a
Nice touch.  UnSweet iced tea had a nice balance of flavor sometimes restaurant tea is flavorless.  Very clean tables and floor.  Women's bath immaculate and spacious. Would recommend for sure and will be back.  We had the breakfast burrito and meat lovers scramble   The biscuits were piping hot and the berry compote tasty"}
{"text":"Was seated right away, which was great! Friendly staff too. My coffee tasted old, it was very bitter. I then ordered the Florentine Benedict with potatoes. My food arrived and it looked presentable. Upon first bite, It was just barely warm and not hot enough. The taste was okay, yet could have been better. I was not impressed overall. 

My daughter ordered the kids macaroni and cheese. The food was unpleasant looking. The macaroni and cheese had melted cheese of course, but then it also had shredded unmelted cheese to garnish. I thought it was a bit odd. She was not to fond of the taste either. My son ordered the biscuits and gravy. He was satisfied with the taste of his food. His only complaint was that the biscuits were too small. He thought it was Odd being called \"biscuits cafe\" with small biscuits. 

While I was impressed with their employees, I was not impressed with their food. I think they can do better than they are currently doing."}
{"text":"We were super excited to try this place as the first time we went to try them they were closed. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and they weren't bad but they were to small. You would think for a restaurant whose name is \"BISCUITS cafe\" their biscuits would be a decent size. They weren't even the size of my palm. We also ordered the skillet and that portion was small as well. Unfortunately I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Almond encrusted french toast is the stuff dreams are made of! I can't stop thinking about it! Awesome service from Jen and Linda for our large party also. Thank you to the management for being so accommodating on a Saturday morning, they had a table ready and waiting for us!  This place is always friendly AND efficient and it is much appreciated! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"We eat here regularly.  Food is ALWAYS great! The service is typically beyond reproach- until today.  Our male server didn't do anything wrong per se BUT he did not seem to really care about us.  I watched our food sit up on the \"warmer\" ( not sure what that area is called exactly) for about 5 minutes.  We waited almost 20 minutes for our food and our server only came by 1x to check on whether my husband wanted his coffee refilled. After our food was served we only saw him when he gave us the check. He never asked us how our food was, to refill our drinks, or to offer a to go container.  This is the ONLY time we have had a less than great experience ( hence the 4 stars)."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and was pleasantly surprised! Excellent food, I got the avocado Benedict and it was delicious, hubby got the two biscuit n gravy breakfast and it was some of the best biscuits n gravy I have ever tasted. Fast service, quaint atmosphere, only thing is there is zero alcohol, so no breakfast mimosa or Bloody Marys :-( But we will definately return, food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Very open and spacious. Average crowd noise level. Very friendly staff. 

My first time here but I will definitely return. I ordered the CFS&E because that's all I ever order for breakfast. It came out in a timely manner and was very good!! Coffee was descent but would prefer stronger blend. The waitress was very friendly and attentive, Kellie was her name and she did a fantastic job in my opinion. 

I will say that the pancakes could be a little lighter. They very heavy so try the biscuits instead."}
{"text":"The cafe is large and very spacious. The service is GREAT. Since it's called Biscuits Cafe, I had to try out the biscuit. Since my chicken and waffles didn't come with a biscuit, I asked our waitress how much one biscuit would be because I want to try it out. She wasn't sure, but she said she'll just bring me one, and even asked what kind of jam I liked. Then later when I mentioned how delicious the raspberry jam was, she told me it was freezer jam and didn't have any preservatives. I don't like jam, but this was very good. I dipped my fried chicken tenders in it too. 

The chicken and waffle I had was alright. The chicken was overly fried and was hard, and the waffle was just a waffle. It was good food but wasn't amazing.

Everything else about this place is great. I would definitely come back to have breakfast/lunch with my friends!"}
{"text":"I was on the fence about coming here based on previous reviews about the service. I am so glad I made the choice to come anyway. The service was prompt and friendly, even on a very busy Sunday morning. Now for the food. My guy got the Brisket Benedict. It was full of meat griddles to perfection on top of an English muffin. It also had perfectly poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce. It was served with a side of hash browns (you can also get red potatoes). It was a big enough portion to fill my guy up. I got the almond encrusted French toast. It was tasty. Crunchy on the outside, sweet and buttery on the inside. It came with good, thick bacon and eggs. I don't like eggs, so they happily substituted hash browns for me. It was a great experience and we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"/: For a place named \"biscuits Cafe\" you'd think the were we something to the biscuits right? Well you'd be wrong like we were. We ordered delivery thru door dash this morning. I the ordered blueberry pancake meal that came with 3 huge pancakes with blueberries on top, 2 eggs and a side of a breakfast meat of your choice, I choose 3 strips of bacon. My fiance ordered the biscuits and gravy that comes with only one biscuit (add another for $2, we thought that was rediculous but maybe they were crazy sized biscuits or something) two eggs and a breakfast meat side, he added hash browns to his meal for $2.99. The hash browns were just bland. The gravy just wasn't very good at all. The biscuits are basic, small and unimpressive. The portions, aside from the pancakes, were small. The prices are rediculous for the portions. The pancakes were huge but they just sent some prepackaged syrup that was no where near enough for the amount of pancakes. I do not recommend this place and will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place ZERO stars, on Jan. 16 at 10 30 am we got typical arizonen service. Came in stood there for 10 minutes a white couple came in and then the hostess ran to the door to seat them. The only reason we were seated is because the couple asked if we were seated, \"clearly we're not if we're standing at the door\". The couple then proceeded to say they were regulars that's why they were being seated before us, WOW! So my wife and I realizing what just happened fit up and left.  So the moral of this story is do not go to this restaurant if you're not a regular and if you're a minority please stay away they treat you accordingly to the code. In 2017 wow, and fyi we went there every weekend since we've been in arizona, never again!"}
{"text":"Never have I had pancakes that you have to cut with a knife. Service was very slow, our order went to the wrong table and then when they brought our food it was cold and sloped together. I posted a picture of dirty straws and a knife that was in our setup. Eggs were cooked perfectly, bacon crunchy, but French fries were under cooked and hardly any bacon on a BLT.  Ceiling fans were on high and uncomfortable with all that air blowing down on you as you ate. $30.00 for pancakes and a BLT, prices are high for the quality you get!"}
{"text":"Just ate breakfast at Biscuits Restaurant in Chandler. This well developed and marketed brand helped determine which restaurant my family would go to after attending our monthly SGI Buddhist meeting. We have eaten at Biscuits on Dobson in Chandler and we're not impressed with the food but when this restaurant opened near our home we decided to go. Still not impressed with the food. This was the third time we ate here and we determined that this would be our last. First, the food is overpriced compared to other restaurants in the area. Second the service is inadequate because there are too many young part-time people holding down the fort. They don't even know what they don't know about the food service industry. Third, the food was not good. The potatoes were crunchy and under cooked. The pancakes were mushy and undercooked. The coffee was weak and watery. My well done English muffin was mushy and under toasted. After complaining to our waitress and manager all we got was an apology. No replacement, discount or raincheck. The only thing this restaurant provides is ambiance and branding. This is the one star. They have yet to live up to expectations as an upscale restaurant to justify the pricing. We suggest an overhaul in staffing that recruits higher-end restaurant management and servers. Until we recover from Biscuits mediocrity we will not be back."}
{"text":"Large selection and portions of standard breakfast and lunch fare. Food quality is good and tastes like breakfast should.  I have been here several times and have had great service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the quality has gone down quickly. Great location, friendly staff but even their eggs are very watery, super low end quality. Our friends had pancakes that were under cooked and super tough from the cook over mixing the pancake batter. Love the to go cups for their coffee though.  Not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"Service was good food came out 'hot' which is always a plus! The strawberry jelly was freshly made it actually tasted like strawberries and not sugar! Awesome!!! I would eat there again...a little off putting that the waitress kept staring at the top of my head when she would one to the table. Maybe me think is there a bird on my head and you're not telling me...BUT the food was good especially the biscuits!!!"}
{"text":"Crazy to see the bad reviews. I'm the pickiest diner I know and I love this place. Almond crusted French toast, omelettes and club sandwich are among faves. The coffee is super good too."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Yes it is a little more than Denny's but the portions you get are more than excessive. Be prepared and come with an empty stomach. After the massive and delicious cinnamon roll (homemade frosting was heavenly) I had their Biscuits omelette with a side of a sweet potato pancake. Everything was amazing, I couldn't put down my fork. Will definitely be going back and make it a regular spot!"}
{"text":"We went here while on a visit to Phoenix. Stopped on a Sunday morning. Had about a 15 minute wait to get in. We split a Denver omelette and a side of bacon. The omelette was good, bacon good, and the service ok considering how busy it was. The strawberry jelly is fantastic! Not a bad value."}
{"text":"I love Biscuits Cafe!  The pancakes were huge and didn't taste like it came out from a box.  The sausage was grilled to perfection and packing with flavor.  I loved how they actually didn't break the over-easy eggs I ordered as well as food coming out hot.  I am glad they finally opened here and it provides a much needed breakfast place not named Denny's."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service and very convenient. The biscuits & gravy are amazing. I like that there's not a lot trendiness in this place. No duncy kids in silly outfits catering to weirdo hipster wannabes, just cool people serving great food."}
{"text":"I never got to taste the food because the service was so bad that I left.  There is a sign that reads, \"we don't serve fast food, we just serve food fast\".  That couldn't be more untrue.  Our server was inattentive and slow. Maybe she was having a bad day;  I try not to hold that against people.  The restaurant was not packed, but was pretty active, but there were 4 servers, no reason for such slow service.  Then when the food finally came, they forgot my youngest son's food, and said it would be right out.  All servers bring out the plates there, so the person who brought our food was not our server, and although she acknowledged the missing food, she went on about serving her customers and not getting mine.  Our server made no effort to pursue the missing food, even when I asked her to look into it, she still went to other tables and took her time going back to the kitchen.  When she came out of the kitchen with empty hands, we got up and left.  Nobody made any effort to resolve our dissatisfaction.  The owner should be embarrassed of this service, or lack of service and corporate should be careful as to whom they sell their name to.  About a year ago, I read reviews of slow service there, and I should have heeded them today.  Will never go back.  If you decide to go, give yourself a lot of extra time, because there is no hustle in this establishment."}
{"text":"Service is good food is sub part. I ordered fish n   chips gf ordered huevos ranchers. My plate came with no lemon and a small portion of tartar sauce and fish was over cooked. Huevos ranger's was good but hash Browns were old and overcooked so definitely not made to order.  For the price food should be better. Will come back but not in a hurry"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the Surprise area breakfast choices.  My wife and I had breakfast at Biscuits today.  The atmosphere is \"modern industrial\".  A bit noisy but, having a busy restaurant is a good sign. This is the only reason it gets a 4.  Not easy to have a quiet conversation.  We had their Apple Cinnamon French Toast Combo and Avocado Benedict along with a Cinnamon Roll.  The portions are really large next time we may consider splitting breakfast.  The French Toast Combo was fluffy and the custard base was excellent, not too sweet.  My wife's Benedict was filled with healthy veggies and perfect poached eggs.  Her serving of hash browns was ample and she shared a ton with me.  It's hard to find an interesting and good place for breakfast in Surprise; however, Biscuit's will be a place that we come back to for lunch and breakfast.  Our cost for French Toast, Avocado Benedict, Cinnamon roll and two coffees came to $33.12 with tax.  This is comparable to other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Well this is my 3rd visit so now I'll review, 1st time our food & service was excellent, 2nd time food was good all but scramble was over cooked and the server needed to brush up, she gave me Luke warm water for tea, ten I had a hair in my butter and nothing was addressed or adjusted for it. Then I asked for strawberry jam to go and she brought me mixed berry pre packed jelly.
3rd time Service good but food was bad. My soft scrambled eggs weren't soft and we asked for crispy hash browns and all that they did was partially cook it on one side, and they were greasy. My husband's omelet, meat lovers wasn't that enjoyable to him like before. We mentioned it to server and register person and no price adjustment was done this time either. I don't think we will return here until they get better"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, fantastic pancakes and french toast.  Great Service, everything was hot and fresh.  Also have been here for lunch their portions were large and very tasty had the turkey melt sandwich. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend the breakfast, the food was great. However,  it is a long wait 30 min before food came out. In addition,  the manager maybe owner was very gruff and made us uncomfortable."}
{"text":"This is usually a solid 5-star choice, but this morning we had a new waitress.  I asked for my eggs to be extra soft, even runny.  the waitress seemed to understand, but she brought out well done, rubbery eggs.  I reluctantly sent them back.  She wanted to take back my whole plate, but luckily I asked for a small plate for the return so that I could keep the other items.  Luckily, because it was more than 10 minutes for the new eggs to come out.  And...yes, they were cooked more well-done than the first set.  Another regular waitress came over and saw the 'situation' and offered to fix it...but my wife is almost done with her meal, so it is just something I need to live with today.  Oh well."}
{"text":"Ok I have been back to this restaurant several times since my initial review and I have to say this is my new fav breakfast place !! I have tried the French toast with eggs and bacon , the cinnamon roll French toast with eggs and bacon , and most recently the smoked brisket eggs Benedict.. That my friends is a knockout !! The hollandaise definitely wasn't from a mix or a can .. Run my friends and don't miss out on this treasure
Seriously best breakfast ever !!!!"}
{"text":"Late breakfast today with the family.  We got a variety of items to try out this new to us place.
Service was great.  We came at a bit of an off time and there was no wait for a table.  We sat on the patio.  The table was very nice and shaded. 
We had the Biscuit omelet and it was very big and delish.  The whole grain toast and freezer jam were a nice accompaniment.  We even purchased some jam to take home.
We also tried the pancakes and French toast.  Both were very good.
The biscuits and gravy were decent but I didn't really care for the hint of oregano.
Next time we plan to try the cinnamon rolls.
My only request would be for them to add alcohol to their menu.  This would be a nice place to spend Sunday morning with a mimosa or Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"First off, this was a Sunday morning, wait times were about 10 minutes to get seated. Not too bad. Then the fun began. We got our drinks within minutes of being seated. Awesome. Then 15 minutes to take our order. Then 45 minutes to get our order. Inexcusable. They were fully staffed. They had more folks walking around looking at things rather than helping customers. They came by the table once to top off our drinks and once to apologize for the wait. When we finally did get our food, the eggs were undercooked, the ham and French toast were burnt, the pancakes were raw, and the potatoes were unseasoned. The kielbasa on the menu sounds as if it's homemade, don't let it fool you, I think they ran next door to the grocery store to get some. How disappointing. We ate because we were so hungry. We did not see our waitress again so we could not discuss these issues with her. There were empty tables around us so I can't believe they were so busy that they couldn't be attentive. When I discussed these matters with the kid working the cash register the only reply he had was 'sorry'. Wow! Poor service, long wait times, poor food. Not worth the hype. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Love me some breakfast foods.  I like the country benedict here.   The gravy is creamy,  salty, and thick.  It's not your usual gravy but still good.   The service is friendly and they have a loyalty program too."}
{"text":"The service was good, and the breakfast was good. However, I would not go back because when we were seated we were presented with dirty torn menu's.  No excuse for that lack of pride,  and it instantly made me feel the place was dirty."}
{"text":"What a great place food is outstanding got to see Jamie the waitress she is amazing if I could rate this place a 10 I would I will be back definitely"}
{"text":"We saw Biscuits had opened here in Summerland and had to try it out. We love it in Phoenix. Came in on a Wednesday at 9am. Place only had 4 tables going so no wait. Waitress was on it and super friendly. Have to comment here on their coffee, hella good. I ordered Breakfast Tacos with Chorizo. Also some Crispy Bacon. This was a great breakfast and the Chorizo is excellent. Wifey ordered Biscuits and Gravy and she says it was damn good. 
Overall the place rocks and will return often."}
{"text":"What a total disaster ! Called from across the parking lot to see what the wait was for 12 people and was told 15-20 min. I said really ? Are you sure? She said yes we are very quick. We drive there LITERALLY across the parking lot and when we get there she says it's an HOUR wait ! WTF ?!

After we wait and are told we were next some IDIOT seats another large party AHEAD of us and WE were there FIRST !  THEN after we FINALLY get sat they took our drink order but left us waiting forever to take our FOOD order. After THAT we waited ANOTHER 25 minutes to get any food ! 

THIS PLACE IS A JOKE ! I'll NEVER come here again ! 

Thanks for TOTALLY screwing up Mother's Day breakfast ! 

We got here BEFORE 10 am and we didn't get our food until 12:18 pm !!!! On top of that my mom was the LAST person to get her food !!! 

The worthless manager didn't even bother to come and see how we were or apologize for the HORRIBLE experience we all had !"}
{"text":"Decent food, very nice staff and a good atmosphere.  A welcome addition to Tempe's breakfast options."}
{"text":"Went there on a late Saturday morning. The place was fairly crowded and very noisy.  The restrooms were dirty along with the restaurant. The coffee was weak and didn't taste good. Ordered a country omelette with a side of biscuits. The biscuits were small and tasted like they come from a package.
Flies all over the place. One of the servers walked through the restaurant with a can of garbage. 
Very pricey for one meal. I will not be going back there and do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places, the biscuits with the fresh made jellies are excellent. Everything I have had here I always enjoyed, much higher quality than Dennys without a price gouge."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly but I'm wildly disappointed with the food. I got my to-go order and it was just a bunch of mush."}
{"text":"A good breakfast close to home and they stay open a little later than many breakfast spots.  Good service too?"}
{"text":"3 of us went yesterday for breakfast. 2 of us had the Almond crusted french toast ala carte. It was fantastic and the portion was huge. The almonds are ground fine, so your not crunching the nuts, and there is a slight hint of cinnamon. It was the best french toast we ever had. The other person had the Cinnamon roll french toast combo which came with 2 eggs and sausage links. He loved it as well. Service was great. The place is very nice, lots of great things on the menu. Can't wait to go back and try something else. I wish you had a location in the NW."}
{"text":"Chaz was a fantastic server!  He was incredibly helpful and friendly with my family of 4 (with two crazy kids). He assisted me in getting the biscuit burger. This thing was huge and delicious. When we left, the lady who helped us pay and later was very friendly as well.

The kids mac & cheese was the best macaroni and cheese I've ever had at a restaurant. The garlic bread that came with it was also some of the best.  My wife's fiesta salad was fresh and delicious as well. A true five-star place for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Always a breakfast favorite, the homemade corned beef hash is delicious. Everyone is nice and they serve large portions."}
{"text":"Well, what to say about this place...the food was okay.  I really could have done the same thing at home and it would have tasted better and wouldn't have been so blah.  The one good thing was the cinnamon rolls...we took a half dozen home with us and they were absolutely amazing.  Also the prices were a little high for the food you got.  I might go back for the cinnamon rolls but for just a general breakfast, I'll most likely go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago and got the avocado benedict which was delicious. My husband got the country benedict which he also really liked. We didn't have to wait for our table and the service was fast. As we were leaving our waitress asked us if we wanted our coffee to go which we really liked. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I spotted this place a couple of week before, and decided to try it for Sunday morning breakfast. I read the reviews, and should have heeded the warnings. The location and setting were fine, but while the customers were mainly older, the wait were mainly younger and seemed disinterested. The menu looked good, but the biscuit and gravy were mediocre, at best. The gravy was congealed and the biscuit was unrecognizable. I asked for extra crispy bacon, but it was soggy, and had been sitting quite a while. Our waitress asked us once, near the end of our meal, \"you guys need anything?\", but otherwise was scarce. Another waitress went from place to place carrying on personal conversations with other waitresses, rather than paying attention to her tables. The prices were higher than most, the coffee was very good. Overall, I can't recommend this and we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great portions, you definitely get what you pay for.  The service was so fast our party of 5 was surprised when the food arrived!  From smoked brisket benedict, corned beef hash, chorizo omelette, french toast and eggs with a huge sausage and the egg white turkey scramble, it was all so delicious!  The fruit was amazing also, so fresh and quality fruit!!  We will go back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Love this cafe! Now one of my favorite lunch/breakfast stops. Portions are large enough to share or box some up for later in the day. Have visited here for breakfast & lunch. The Reuben sandwich was delicious, not greasy or fatty. Shared the veggie omelet with a friend and substituted the cinnamon french toast as a combo dish, was especially thrilled the server did not respond with \"sorry we don't substitute\" - we both enjoyed the food & the service. Coffee is good too, had a variety of creamers."}
{"text":"There where flies everywhere inside. The food was not very tasty and neither was the coffee. The waitress was awesome though!"}
{"text":"The overall environment of the place is great. Nicely decorated. The food was less than average. Skip the pancakes. They were inedible for me. They felt like cardboard and were very porous. The syrup just sunk in right through and didn't spread out on the pancake. Not appetizing-looking. 

My omelet (fresh Greek omelet) sounded delicious on the menu. Couldn't eat it though.... as there was a huge chunk of a plastic piece burned onto and mixed into my omelet. Didn't see THAT on the ingredients list! It was apparently the cook's spatula!!!! Not a pleasant experience. First and last time. The manager didn't do anything other than not charge us for the meal I didn't even eat! Ummm thanks? definitely won't be going back with that kind of disregard for customer service!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I have tried their chicken fried steak, waffles, and biscuit specials. They were all great! Fast service. The staff make sure your drinks are always refilled. Our favorite morning place!!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast and food. My food could have been a little hotter but overall good food. I had the eggs and kielbasa and the kielbasa is very flavorful. What I did love the most is their homemade strawberry preserves. I truly tasted like the freshest strawberries you ever ate. My husband had the country omelette with biscuits and gravy and he said it was all marvelous."}
{"text":"Really nice patio area.  In addition to patio dining area it appears there's a place to sit while waiting to be seated.  Another plus.
I was preceded by my son to the table so no clue how hospitable the host/hostess may have been.  Our waitress was timely and quite pleasant.  She used language that must work like subliminal messages because she seemed to convince me that I would enjoy my dining experience, even though it is not the same Biscuits I originally thought, and that I would be coming back here to dine again in the near future.
After me taking a lengthy period of time to decide what I was hungry for we managed to place our order.  I will say that our waitress checked in at least three times before I had made up my mind.  Another plus.  I've sat and waited at other restaurants because I wasn't ready to order when the server first came to take an order.
This girl was on task.
My coffee mug was never empty and my son's beverage got to no less than 1/3 full during our meal.
I ordered two eggs with rare bacon, red potatoes and a sweet potato pancake.  I asked if I could substitute the pancake and was told yes, but it would be one instead of two.  Heck, that's more than enough for me.
Son had the chicken fried steak with the hash browns and biscuits.  He said the hash browns were not good at all, even after salt & pepper.  I suspect the were over boiled cuz how else could they be bad?
My potatoes were good.  Creamy, nicely spiced and enhanced with a bit of onion.  My bacon was darn near perfect.  Thick, not excessively fatty and cooked to order.  Lots of places can't manage that last part.   And the sweet potato pancake was really good.  It was well flavored, dense and required no butter or syrup to enjoy.  A tad of butter and syrup seemed to transform my pancake into something more reminisce of sweet potato pie.  I shared it with my son and we got through about half of the thing.  He said the biscuit was light and fluffy in comparison.  A good contrast.
Overall, nice atmosphere, wonderful service and tasty food.  
We'll be back."}
{"text":"disappointing.  The location is awesome and we are always looking for good new food places.  We were seated quickly and our server all though friendly enough seemed over whelmed (aka under staffed).  I ordered a basic french toast combo (french toast, 2 eggs scrambled and bacon).  Long wait for the food.  My wife pointed out the sign that says they aren't fast food and everything is made fresh.  Well neither half appears to be true.  My french toast was soggy, my eggs cool and my bacon with limp and greasy.  My wife didn't complain about her food but I know she was not impressed.  You are better off going down the road a mile to the new Black Bear Diner.  Way better food, quality and service.  I will not give this place a second chance, sorry."}
{"text":"Great breakfast atmosphere and friendly staff! My wife and I came for breakfast and our server sat with us helping us to decide what to eat without being pushy. Large coffee cups with lots of different creamers to chose from. The price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Been here a few times already.  Food is always great as well as the service.  Today I tried the almond crusted French toast.  Delicious! The atmosphere is very clean and modern.  Great place to have breakfast!"}
{"text":"Meh, not so good. The place was clean and the service was good but the food not so much. I had the corned beef hash. It was fresh but it had huge pieces of corned beef and not hashy enough for me. The potatoes in the hash were crunchy not cooked enough. My husband had a Belgian waffle and sausage links. The links were cooked through but the texture was soft and mushy it felt like eating raw pork. My aunt had 1/2 sandwich and chicken noodle soup she said it wasn't anything special. Plus neither my aunt or husband like strong coffee and that is all they offer. You can't please everyone but that's why there is Yelp."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch. The host was really nice and sat us right away. Our waitress was totally annoyed with us and the table and chairs had food on them. Asked to get a towel and there was a total eye roll. We waited a long time to be served on but when the food came it was good. I would like to give it another shot but I would hope their wait staff would step it up."}
{"text":"Just so-so at the Chandler AZ location. Double the cost of a Waffle House , and half as good."}
{"text":"Pass on this. If I am going to load on carbs they better not make me regret it. My dish was not good. My husband did not enjoy his. Ok another place we would rather not spend money on"}
{"text":"First off, AMAZING FOOD!
The portions are huge. Was put into a foodcoma after eating here! 
Emily was our server and she was very nice/sweet and professional.
My wife and I were very impressed with this place. This was our first of many visits for sure! 
The rewards program is pretty cool with all the discounts and points you get towards food. 
Highly recommend this place if you haven't tried it. Our food was our pretty quick too, so we weren't waiting long for anything. Our server checked on us and made sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Super irritated with them. I've been coming here for a year and I've never had service that bad. Everyone working was super rude and we had one lady who was putting the silverware bundles together yell into the kitchen asking what I was waiting for even though she was 5 feet from me. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"My in-laws took us here for a late breakfast on veteran's day. We sat outside and were provided a friendly and timely waitress. I can't remember her name but she was very accommodating. 

I ordered the avocado toast, eggs, and a side of sausage. I'll be honest and say that sausage might have been bad because it was hurting my stomach all day. I eventually had to expel it from my body via mouth a few hours later. This doesn't happen often but when you know, you know. And it was the sausage that my body refused to digest. 

Aside from that, everyone else enjoyed their food. Not too much else to say about this place. 

They also do not support Veteran's Day meal deals FYI."}
{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant. Can't go wrong with the menu.. All yummy: French Toast, Pancakes, potatoes and has browns. Service was lovely. Only complaint: THE BATHROOMS!!! Only two bathrooms and a long line to get in. Kudos for making them unisex but after coffee,  only two stalls are not enough."}
{"text":"I love a great breakfast place! The coffee was so good! My omelet was gigantic and delicious. The prices were average for a diner and service was good. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Running errands with the Fam and everyone is starting to get a little hangry. Driving down Bell and looking from side to side. \"Hey!  We haven't tried Biscuits yet!\"  Soooo glad we did!!!  I HAD to try the Almond crusted French Toast, it's what I do.  It was DELISH!  And now I have to go back and try the pumpkin pancakes and sweet potato pancakes. Hubby had the Brisket dip, Phillie style, and he really liked it and my daughter had biscuits and gravy, and wishes she would have ordered 1 more biscuit    We will definitely be coming back!  The service was perfect too. Very Satisfied!!!"}
{"text":"The main reason I come to Biscuits is for the Wheat Montana Bread.  I grew up only a half hour from where this bread is grown and produced and being so far from home it's a little piece of comfort in a chaotic city like Vegas but the breakfast is FREAKING AWESOME"}
{"text":"It's nice to see a menu that covers a broad enough range to make everyone happy. 

My group ordered our individual meals but shared family style so we could sample all this new place had to offer. Their corned beef was made in house and shredded. It was slightly seasoned and needed salt and pepper. I like that though since many times I have ordered and it was just too much salt.

They're sweet potato pancake was really good. Light and fluffy but not too sweet.  

My only real complaint is the gravy they use for their biscuits. It tastes more like a chowder than a gravy. It could use more sausage too. 

Our servers were great. They came by very 7-10 minutes and offered us refills for our coffee and even gave us a to-go cup when we were settling our bill. I was also surprised by how busy it was on a Monday morning."}
{"text":"I just came out of this restaurant actually today and the reason I decided to try it was from all the wonderful reviews I found here on yelp but guess what? After waiting for half an hour, our breakfast was no where to be found. There was no waiter who even asked us or checked on us. Finally, when the people seated behind me got their breakfast (they came way after we arrived), I asked one of the waitress what happen to our order? After waiting for another 10 mins, our waiter came back and said, \"well we made a mistake, your order drop on the floor and nobody saw it so we are just ordering them right now\". We cancelled our order, paid an $8 coffee and left. Suffice to say, NO, we won't be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast on a Saturday morning, and it was a great experience. I really liked the layout and design of the interior. Everything was very new and modern. The food was great as well I had the veggie omelette and I enjoyed it. My girlfriend had eggs Benedict and she liked hers as well. Food came fast and service was above average. I will be going back"}
{"text":"Sat down at 850; drinks came up right away from the man in a pink shirt, which might have been the manager. Great drink service.

About 15 MINUTES after; the waitress took our order, which didnt add up since there were around 5 to 6 servers for about 8 to 9 tables.  Food came out very quickly, which made up for the slow order taking.   

Update: the man in the pink shirt is the owner/manager.  He was very attentive and very willing to hear our feedback, which explain the fast drink service.  In addition, we found out the lady pushing her staff behind the glass was the wife of the owner.   Kinda like the urgency she enforce to her kitchen staff.   

I also love the idea of having an open kitchen where you can see everything that is going on behind the scene. 

My wife ordered the Joe's Special that was made into a burrito.   Excellent! 

I had the simply pick three, which was like everywhere else.   I did make the mistake of ordering egg whites and forgot to tell the waitress I wanted country egg whites and not from a carton.  Oh well.

My kids ordered the kids special.  Fyi, drinks are not included.  Buyer beware. 

All in all this place is very spacious, and does a good job in catering to their customers."}
{"text":"Called when we were less than a mile away to check on the wait. They wouldn't take our name for the list (understandable) but assured it was a 10 minute wait. We showed up less than 2 minutes later, get the kids unloaded from the car, walk in and they tell us it's a 50 minute wait. GRRRR.
I like the food but they need to work on their communication."}
{"text":"Their food is good but service is going severely downhill. Used to like this place. The wait time is long, while plenty of to go orders are constantly being filled, which makes the sit down customers have to wait longer. There is no excuse when poor service comes up, the women at the counter just state \"We know, it's gotten bad\"."}
{"text":"Fabulous food with a fantastic price. The staff can't be beat! They are the best. They are very attentive and kind! I will miss them since I am moving to Texas. This is a restaurant I wish I could take with me."}
{"text":"Thought we were going to the place just called Biscuits so were a bit disappointed with no grits but the food was very good (had the benedict Florentine). Arrived at 7am on Saturday and they were still setting up and only had one waitress for the whole place. Not her fault but definitely felt the lack of an adequate number of servers."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and it was not a good experience. when we went to pay first they messed up the receipt  and we where about to pay for other customers until we notice! The girl in the front was so unenergetic! She seemed like she hated her job completely! They made us wait almost 10mint to clear the whole mess! There was a bunch of people waiting in line . It was super awkward. they couldn't figure out how to split it that he end up only charging my friend!"}
{"text":"Wife and I had breakfast Thursday morning. Kathy waited on us and she was excellent. Biscuits and gravy along with remainder of breakfast was extremely disappointing. Biscuits had to be cut with knife and seemed like Pilsbury Poppin Fresh Biscuits that were overcooked or sitting for quite awhile. Everything was cold. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Need a big farm style carb loaded breakfast...this is your place. Good biscuits and strawberry jam. I had the bacon and eggs and my friend had the country omelet ...very good but enough for 4 people...had to take home a box. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"Great Food
Large portions
Excellent Service

Had a bacon omelette tons of bacon and the homemade jam was awesome. Smooth coffee and never was empty. The people workin there hustle and make sure your food is on time. I will never go anywhere else for breakfast for now on."}
{"text":"When I first looked at the menu, I thought the prices seemed a little high.  After getting and eating our food, I decided the prices were great.  The food was delicious and the portions were huge.

I order the chicken fried steak with 2 scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, and biscuits.  The steak was huge and was covered in sausage gravy; not just plain white gravy.  The hashbrown order was big.  The two biscuits were small and a little dry but came with plenty of butter and strawberry jam.  There were supposed to be two eggs but I would guess that I actually got four.  

My wife got the chicken tenders.  She could not finish the french fries and could only eat half of the tenders. 

Everything was delicious.  Except for the hashbrowns.  I ordered them extra crispy but they were just barely brown.  The cook did not use enough oil on the grill so the had sploches of brown with mostly pale, undercooked potato on the surface.  The server offered to have them re-done but that is never a good idea.

Speaking of the server, she was excellent.

Overall, an excellent meal.  I highly recommend them.  Just don't order the hashbrowns."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast on Friday around 11:00 am. After standing in line for ~10 minutes to be seated (there were plenty of open tables) I was finally seated. For some reason it also took the same amount of time for me to receive my beverage. Twenty minutes later I recieved my food. 

I ordered the French toast and berries with no whip cream. The food came out with a giant dollop of whip cream. The bacon was really good. Eggs were over cooked. The worst part though, was the berry mix. It was all still frozen. The larger berries were rock hard. For the price and wait I would at least expect fresh fruit. 

When the bill came it totalled 19.xx for an ice tea, French toast, and frozen berries. 

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast was delicious as usual. The sweet potato pancakes are really good ! The turkey and cranberry sandwich along with the soup were just right. The reason for the 3 star rating is because we were sitting next to a manager of some sort for the restaurant when the cook comes out in chef pants and chef shirt just beyond gross. It's only 11am he can't be in that soiled of clothing at this time of day. It was like he had worn those clothes for two days. Very displeasing to see in a place where the service and food are good. A dirty clothed cook makes you wonder what the kitchen is like."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. I ordered huevous rancheros. It was cold and tasted like it came out of a can. I ordered crispy potatoes, they came crispy on the outside and barely warm on the inside. Not exactly what I was thinking. We also had the cinnamon roll, barely had any cinnamon ( like I couldn't taste it at all) and way too much lemon in the icing. 
All that said I will be back because the service was top notch, they listened to everything I said, took the cold meal off our bill and the manager came out apologized also."}
{"text":"Posted a tip with more details but we were very pleased with everything. Food good and we'll cooked, good coffee,  good service. Biscuits and gravy were awesome - not southern style fyi. We'd come back for sure.  We came on a Saturday around 9am for reference."}
{"text":"I generally do not eat breakfast but decided to go for it on my birthday.  What a great find.  Had the Avocado Benedict and added ham to it.  Food cooked to perfection and my server, Theresa was just great."}
{"text":"I did not think the biscuits were that great.  I think if you are going to name your restaurant after a particular food, it must meet expectations of wonderful.  The biscuits, although good, were small and not wonderful.  Service a bit off, but understandable because they just opened.  The chorizo omelet was great but biscuits and gravy not so good. It tasted like an accidental pepper overload.  Thus, the place is good but not amazing.  Just ok."}
{"text":"When I walked in, I thought the restaurant was decorated very nicely.  There were quite a few customers for a Tuesday morning.  They offer loaves of bread and cinnamon rolls for purchase.  I ordered the biscuits cafe omelet and almond crusted French toast with hash browns.  The omelet and hash browns were just okay, but the French toast was really good.  They have a good variety of options and I'd like to try the restaurant, again.  The waitress was very nice.  She checked on me often and helped me decide what to order.  The only unfortunate part was I didn't receive my food for over 30 minutes so I had to eat quickly and ask for my French toast to be boxed up since it wasn't ready before I needed to leave.  The young man who worked the register also apologized for the wait on food."}
{"text":"I'm kicking myself for not eating here sooner. I've been hearing great things about this place from everyone I talk to in Surprise. I drive past it all the time. From the second we walked in we were greeted and seated immediately. Right near the door we're the cutest coffee mugs for sale and I love my coffee so I told myself I could not leave without adding it to my collection. The atmosphere is inviting with Great Wall art and sayings. Our waitress was awesome and our orders of coffee and juice were brought out quickly. The place was busy for a weekday and everyone seems to be enjoying their food. I decided on a chorizo omelette. I can not even explain how great it was. The present was awesome. It came filled with beautiful green peppers, onions, cheese, ground chorizo, and avocado. So much flavor, and so HUGE. It also came with a choice of hash browns or country potatoes and a side of toast or biscuit. I chose the hash browns and toast. I couldn't even eat the hash browns because I was so full from the omelette. The toast came with the yummiest jam. My coffee stayed hot my entire meal and true to my word I left with a new mug. Will definitely be back with the entire family."}
{"text":"Average food. Inhospitable  hostess.  We were expecting outstanding food based on other people's recommendations.  First person we see (hostess) is extremely rude!  I will point out our waitress was really nice and provided good service (hence the 2 stars).  The food was so blah, that I wouldn't recommend this place. There are so so many other great breakfast places close o this area."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast. Biscuits are yummy and red potatoes very tasty. Served with lots of bacon"}
{"text":"I have to start off this review by saying that I love breakfast. And when it comes to breakfast, there is only one Place that truly hits all the marks. I just wanted to put that out there first.

This is a joint that has been on my list for some time. Today was the day.

I can't say that I have any outright complaints, but I do need to mention that for a place called biscuits, some people expect BISCUITS. I got them, and they were delicious; but man they were TINY. C'mon now.

I also had the corned beef hash and eggs. The Hash was a little...different that what I'm used to, but it was good! The potatoes were really well seasoned and tasty.

Mom is simple and her cheese omelette with wheat toast was solid and delicious.

Wife had the pulled pork and she loved it.

There was one real highlight to our meal: the JAM. IT was strawberry and it was freaking phenomenal on everything. I ate my leftovers with a spoon. So good.

The service was good, but not exceptional. No complaints.

Overall, I will definitely be back, but it's not going to knock any other Place off the top of my list, either."}
{"text":"We went for the first time on Wednesday. Food was great! Waitress was great and they have the best hot chocolate! Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Food was good. Price seemed ok. I like ihop better. I didnt like sitting on the wooden park benchs they had inside. But, the waitress was nice and it had a nice vibe."}
{"text":"I'm rather surprised by some of the reviews because I thought this place was great! My friend had the vegetable scramble and today is my cheat day, so I had the cinnamon roll French toast. It was yummy! And the service was fabulous! We sat outside cuz it's such a beautiful day. The outside eating area could offer more ambience, but it was clean and the service was still good out there. My friend and I were happy to find a new breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Great location. Service was good.  The food not so much. Potatoes weren't cooked right, biscuits small, waffles not crispy enough to my liking.   Prices but high for casual neighborhoods restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is not good. Everything taste bland, if it's not bland it's drenched in butter or salt. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Yum super cheap and cool decorations. There aren't many breakfast places here in Tempe, which makes this place all the better. Great service and huge portions!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible.10.50 for a lunch menu
The food was like it came out a box.if you think this place is a bargain or at all good you need to get out more often.i ordered the Mac n cheese and it really looked as if it came out of a box and a few foofy thing all over it.after I sent it back I just ask for a soup.im writing this cause I've since been sick all day and it's now 11:30 at night and I'm violently ill.my son ordered the fish and chips and neither him are I are a that picky.he took it home and threw it away.long 
John silvers has bigger and crispier fish that that place.this is Vegas where we know between good and bad food.and this place is bad.i never get this sick from food but here I am.RUN THE OTHER WAY!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place was a total sit down restaurant. I thought you could grab and go.

Food was okay. Pricing is extremely high for what it is. I think they are catering to being next to Midwestern Med school. 

Portion sizes are very large. I got the chicken and waffles. I do not recommend their chicken strips! 

Overall- meh"}
{"text":"This is exactly the kind of breakfast place you want! The place is named Biscuits so I was pleased when the biscuits lived up to my expectations. The strawberry preserves are heavenly and could (and should) be spread on anything you can find! The sausage gravy on my chicken fried chicken was thick and flavorful. Finally, the eggs were a perfectly cooked over-easy. If this place wasn't a five star breakfast spot before, it became one when they brought out complimentary chocolate covered strawberries! 

I'll be back here very soon!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and clean little cafe. Service was excellent.
Food was good, fresh, came out quickly.
I had the half Turkey Sandwich w/cup of Tortilla Soup.
Soup was excellent.... very nice flavor!
Sandwich was also very good... very generous amount of turkey, lettuce, tomato, mayo on wheat. 
My husband had the BLT.... his sandwich was great!!!! I stole a bite and wish I had ordered the same!
The bacon was again very generously given, nice and thick and crispy! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my mom yesterday for a Sunday brunch. We went there around 12:30 and it wasn't too crowded--we got seated immediately.

I had a hankering for corned beef and hash, so that's what I ordered. Unfortunately it wasn't quite what I was expecting...at other brunch places I've been to, the corned beef and hash browns are cooked and served together, but here the corned beef was served with scrambled eggs on top, and the hash browns were on the side. I was a bit disappointed by that.

Other than the disappointing food, everything else was great. Service was prompt, our food came out quickly, and our server stopped by our table multiple times to inquire about our meal."}
{"text":"This place is great for breakfast, super nice and clean location with great service and huge portions. We came Saturday morning at 9:30 & it only took 10 minutes to seat us. The food is really spectacular also. I had the bacon & eggs, pancakes, waffles, & now the chorizo omelet (all great). The hash browns are awesome, and even the country potatoes are cooked on a grill (not deep fried!!). Next time I come here I'm splitting my meal."}
{"text":"Not thrilled with the waitress or the food but the Custer service at the register was amazing. She actually cared about our experience and assured me if we try it again it will be better. We will find out!"}
{"text":"With a name like Biscuits, I felt compelled to stop and try it out. I'm glad I did. 

This is a huge diner open for breakfast and lunch. I had the \"one biscuit and gravy\" combo with gravy on the side and hash browns. The hash browns were a little bland but everything else was delish. The biscuit was fluffy, eggs were good, and thick sliced bacon - that's automatic love. I'm not big on gravy so I didn't try it, but it looked well seasoned. 

I ordered hot tea as a beverage and loved the assortment that they served. It's a rarity to be offered a selection but it is greatly appreciated. 

The waitress was lovely and the food was served pretty quickly. The location is great and there is plenty of parking as it is in a shopping plaza. 

I would definitely come back again. Sometimes these lesser known restaurants are a nice departure from the chains. Very peaceful, quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm sad to give this place a 3 because it looks like it has potential and the other ratings were so good, which is why I decided to give this place a try  .
They sat us down very fast and tried to take our order right away which was good but when I asked for a couple of more min our waitress forgot about us and didn't come back for about 20 min and then our order was wrong she states she didn't hear that she asked to remake but they took very long to make it that we decided to pick out at it, and she never check back to make sure we were ok and coffee topped off! I had to waive her down Lastly because the portions are big we got To go boxes and no bags! Sadly I would not recommend this To my friends and family nor would I come back. Food was comparable to IHOP and Denny's"}
{"text":"Tried this place out this morning because it's so close to my house....I have not ONE complaint!  Friendly service, nice atmosphere and my breakfast was perfect in flavor AND presentation.  So impressed!  I ordered the almond & cinnamon encrusted French toast with over-medium eggs and a (hefty) side of thick, UNBELIEVABLE bacon.  Three slices, not two.  The other 2 people with me agreed that this classic cafe is fantastic and we all will return soon.  Don't think twice, just GO!!  :)"}
{"text":"10 minutes to get our drink order.
10 minutes to get our food. 
10 minutes to get silverware.
10 minutes to get our check.

Food was okay. Came out cold...  Was even colder by the time we got silverware.

 It's breakfast... Nothing special to set it apart from other breakfast joints. All the wait times don't help it's case. You can't have just good breakfast and bad service."}
{"text":"i dont give out a five star to easily.... here's the low down... PROS: Excellent service. ..fresh  homemade food  (i had the chic fried steak amazing) Delicious  homemade  jam  ..Best biscuits and gravy in valley (could almost pass as my own). The coffee is flavorful not watered down chicory. CONS: Serving portion could be your next 3 meals with a price tag to match."}
{"text":"First time, great service from Elizabeth. She made us feel welcome, was attentive but knew when to not approach which I appreciate. Food was good, I had the French toast combo, the BF had the Country Fried steak. We will definitely rerun."}
{"text":"The portions are good and most of time I can't finish my plate since I always order with my eyes. I have never had a bad experience here and it's one of my go to spots for breakfasts."}
{"text":"Worth the wait for your food. Presentation is just how it tastes, Great! Personal fan of club sandwiches. Serve was friendly. Roommate got the veggie omelet and loved it. Can't go wrong with their house made biscuits with butter and jelly."}
{"text":"Pancakes are DELICIOUS!  Portion sides are hardy and huge!!  Homemade Corn Beef Hash was flavorful with red potatoes spiced just right!  Best of all the Biscuit and Gravy Wow Gigantic serving-Definitely a must order when coming here! Extremely  friendly servers and wait staff.   Looks like they have a steady flow of regulars including one WWII veteran who was known by staff and welcomed in this friendly establishment!  Family owed and we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Little pricey, but worth every bite. Try the cinnamon rolls!"}
{"text":"This place is just awful. The first time I came and sat outside and the wait staff was rude and cold-especially the hostesses when I cashed out. I had opted for a healthy option on the menu but it came out with cubed processed meat and was so gross and flavorless.
The next time went a year later and decided it probably was a place that I should order biscuits and gravy and bacon and eggs. This Tim I opted for take out, and since I live around the corner, I got there pretty quickly. The hostess this time was WAY nicer, but when I got home my gravy was cold and not at all good-bland!!!
The potatoes I ordered \"extra crispy\" were so undercooked I had to fry them in my own pan for ten minutes! 
The bacon looked like it had been from a cafeteria  and was very chewy instead of crispy. 
This place will not be getting a third try from me. Driving the extra distance to Black Bear is worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service slow. 
Complained to waitress and was told owner to cheap to hire more people 
I told her they will lose more customers
We waited 15 minutes to place order
Owner needs to fix this problem
We feel bad for employees"}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try this place. Not sure why they call it Biscuits, the ones they served were small and dry. I expected great food on Big biscuits, far from it. I was extremely disappointed. The Chicken Fried steak i got was a mass produced frozen patty that they deep fried. Come on guys, any crappy restaurant can do the same. How about some real home made food, especially for the bold pricing of your product. The prices were Very high especially for breakfast. We both ate a breakfast and the bill was almost $40. They also charged me $2.50 for having my gravy on the side, which they never told me and just stabbed me with it on the bill, thats atrocious. Shame on them for doing that. When i said something to the girl cashing me out she said, \"thats how it is sir, its considered a side\". I told her that should have been discussed with me when ordering, gravy still comes with the meal. I got less gravy in the small bowl then they would have put on the meal itself. I will never be back. This place is a glorified fast food joint. You can get a better breakfast at Golden Corral for $8. Sad, another crap restaurant in Surprise."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for breakfast based on it's 4-star Yelp rating.  The staff was nice but it took forever for our order to be placed.  When our food arrived at the table 25 minutes later, it was less than average.  Fast forward 30 minutes and now we're feeling sick.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"When it 1st opened it was like a secret place but it seems to be getting busier. We love it here--good and consistent. If we bring the pups and sit outside, they are very accommodating to us. Wish the outdoor was bigger and more shaded, enjoy sitting out. Everything I've ordered has been good. Great price and portions. Close to home. Biscuits and strawberry jam is sooo good. Yes the biscuits are small but, who cares, they are good. One day we had an extra long food wait so our waitress brought us out biscuits and jam to snack on--great service!"}
{"text":"Very good food, it's a shame I did not get to enjoy it. 

I arrived an hour before closing on a Sunday and got my favorite scramble!  I looked around and remembered buying something on the counter last time I was there , but didn't see anything this time. 

After my meal arrived, I saw an employee pushing a cart out from the kitchen area. The bottom shelf was full of their muffins. They have several tasty flavors, but it seemed like they were more anxious to get out if there than making these available to the customers that were still coming in. 

After my eggs, I started on the pancakes I got as part of the meal. My iced tea needed a self refill from the fountain drink area, but the brewed iced tea containers were already gone. 

When they started sweeping out from under part of the table I was still seated at, I realized that I better find another new early afternoon venue for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"A new and nicely appointed breakfast/brunch/lunch spot.  You walk up to order and then they bring your food out to you.  The food was okay.  I got a meltz sandwich.  The bacon was quite good; but I found the sandwich a little damp with melted butter.  They give you a chocolate covered strawberry, which is a cute little touch.  The prices were reasonable.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Well, I went back.  I gave Biscuits a second chance. I was seated and given coffee.   Once again I sat there for over 10 minutes and was ignored.  I tried to get a waitresses attention, but it didn't work.  There were only 5 tables with customers.  I counted 5 waitresses, and some of them were talking about non work related issues.  When some new customers were greeted when they came in, I interrupted and said that I had been waiting and no waitress.
Once I got someone and gave my order, my food came fast.
I went online and no email for customer service.  They want you to join their club, but they don't want to hear from you."}
{"text":"I just can't hold this back any longer.  On Tuesday 8-8-2017 my wife and I went to Biscuits for a nice breakfast.  At least that's what we thought.  My wife order scramble eggs, Hash browns and pancakes.  Hash browns were so hard you could use them for shingles on a house.  Pancakes were terrible.  As for me I order three eggs over easy.  One egg was over easy, one medium and the other was broke and hard.  Hash browns also could go on the roof.  Orn juice was good. I'm done with this place."}
{"text":"I'm on vacation in Phoenix and I've been here everyday. The food is so good! I get the joes scramble. They're so good about substitutions and happily accommodate to almost any dietary need. I exchanged my eggs for egg whites and the bacon in the scramble for turkey bacon. The manager, Zach greeted me every day and was very attentive!
Oh and the biscuits! I had 4 biscuits everyday. Also, no other breakfast restaurant I've been to has better jam. Their strawberry and Marion berry jam is incredible. Not your average smuckers packets.
Anyway, 5 out of 5 stars. Thrill ride of the century."}
{"text":"Always get in quickly on any weekend. The food is great and never leave disappointed. The staff is hit or miss when it comes to servers. I have had some really great service and other times I have had to wait 20 minutes to have my bill brought to the table."}
{"text":"Best French toast ever, my daughter loves the blueberry pancakes. Excellent customer service, you can tell this restaurant is well managed and they pay attention to the details. Five stars..."}
{"text":"been here 2xs now.  first time was good had the Reuben sandwich. I liked it. there is a worker that tried to clean my table 2xs as I was still eating. dude chill... 2nd time came and had a scramble with chorizo... I have to say the servers even though some are new are all very nice and effective.  the strawberry preserves they give with the biscuits and toast is the bomb.  I will come again for sure.  nice to have a place like this in the west vally.  atmosphere is a tad loud for me but it's ok with the open style."}
{"text":"This place was so busy!  Because this part of town needed a new/additional breakfast place.  It's not fancy but it was new, cute, clean.  And we loved the food.  Service was great even on a very busy Sunday.  5 of us ate for cheap and we loved it.  It didn't take long to get seated either because this is a decent sized place.  I definitely would recommend it, and I will go back, even if they are busy."}
{"text":"I love coming to this cafe but they seem disorganized and slow.  The  food is good but seems expensive for the serving size.  I hope they get organized quick or I will have to find another cafe."}
{"text":"The food is above average but the management brings the score way down. I walked in today and they had the poor busser girl also sitting all of the guests and she was also in charge of running the cash register at the front because they don't allow you to pay from your table. So I waited both to be seated and to pay because the busser girl was busy handling all her other roles. The manager ended up sitting me and ringing me up because she was so happy. Maybe not hanging out in the kitchen so much would be better? They seem to have an emphasis on getting the food out quick which is probably why the manager is in there a lot but if it's not hot and you have to wait to get seated, wait for your server to bring your receipt so you can wait at the counter doesn't seem to be a receipe for success."}
{"text":"Friendly staff with a large dinning section compared to a Egg Works.  The Cinnamon Roll French Toast was really good.  The Country Benedict was also really good however the eggs and hash browns were I felt average at best.  The pricing is on par for the service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Really good food! Really good service and huge coffees. 

I ordered the pick three, which is great for anyone since it offers options of a little bit of everything. I opted for eggs over easy, dry sourdough and strawberries that came with whipped cream (cream not mentioned on menu though). It was nine bucks. The toast came with strawberry preserves she referred to as freezer jam. It was excellent. The eggs were cooked perfect and the toast was good. 

He got this black sausage plate and oatmeal. I was not impressed. He liked it. The oats were weird. it came with bags of nuts and dried fruit. It was like a brick. Needed liquid. 

The coffee is good, huge and good. Lots of creamer options/flavors too. There is a patio that is dog friendly and the staff is great.

The atmosphere is a little loud and very open but inviting. I wish it was more sectioned off. That's my taste though. 

I would be back...the only weird thing other than the oats is the biscuits are so small and underwhelming. The place is called Biscuits Café...maybe it should be called Jammed Café or Cinnamon Roll Café since those are something to talk about!! Must get one of them rolls next time as there will be a next time :)"}
{"text":"Second time going back after trying it a few months ago. I like to give time for a place to mature after it opens and do a recheck. In this case, much the same - the place is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is okay. I had the Southwest scramble and I have to say, surprisingly bland for something with Chorizo in it and though I appreciate the bell pepper and onions, I would recommend dicing them up a bit versus having them in strips.

As for coffee, decent drip diner coffee but I would like a mug versus a huge hot drink cup. Another diner noticed the same thing - a mug allows one to have a reasonable amount of coffee and then fill it up again so it stays hot. In addition, the little hot cup protection ring should be over by the coffee as you fill up the coffee in one place and then have to carry it over to where the hot rings are, and the creamer and sugar, and it is hot! 

The hashbrowns looked great but they use some sort of buttery spray when cooking them and it is an off flavor in a hashbrown. In addition, the insides of the hashbrown are somewhat starchy - if they dice their own potatoes I would recommend they wash the shredded potatoes to remove the starch. 

Oh, I did like the chocolate covered strawberry, that is a nice touch. Other than that, I truly wish I liked Biscuits more as it is a close walk from my house. Hopefully I'll try it again and change my mind."}
{"text":"Service was great but the food left a lot to be questioned!  Very high priced, bacon obviously cooked way prior and hard dried out, gravy had little flavor, and biscuits?? If your a biscuit cafe you would think it would be big, fresh fluffy biscuits right?? Nope! Very disappointed and when you charge 34.00 for 2 eggs, biscuits gravy and potatoes with 2 drinks, it better be damned good."}
{"text":"Won't let me do no stars.  What the hell is wrong with this place?  Service was terrible.  Food was cold.  Don't waste your money.  Go to the Hangar Cafe at the Chandler Airport.  Good food and a staff that makes your breakfast experience great."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of 3 times now and I'm still kind of feeling mixed about this place.  

The food has been really good, but for a good breakfast joint, their coffee sucks!  I've gotten something different during each visit and enjoyed more everything except for the red potatoes side dish, which always seems to be kind of cold. 

The first time that I went there, we were rushed and no offer for refills of coffee at any point.  Servers started mopping floors while we were finishing up food and then when going to the restroom before leaving, I almost got hit in the eye with a mop handle.  

On the second visit, it took a really long time to get food.  I mean, a really long time.  After two awkward experiences, was hesitant on returning. 

On the last visit everything seemed to go well.  It was well paced. Got coffee refills, even though the coffee wasn't great and didn't have to deal with mops."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had a $10 gift certificate from another Biscuits location which wasn't honored here. That's not ideal customer service, but it's forgivable.

What's not forgivable eggs Benedict with poached eggs that already have been broken, leaving the \"grilled\" English muffin drowning in yolk and far too much hollandaise. The entire mess was much too salty, and the hash browns appeared in an odd block shape.

The coffee lacked any semblance of flavor. My girlfriend's bacon was burnt, and her Belgian waffle honestly could have come out of a toaster.

The upside: Our server was fast and friendly. Seating was easy to find, and Biscuits was open for breakfast on Memorial Day."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the biscuits and gravy because when you have biscuit in the name of your restaurant it must be good, right. Wrong... The biscuit was doughy and the gravy was bland. I ordered the meat lover scramble which was good and my wife ordered an omelette with a side of pancakes. The pancakes were the best part of our experience here.
The menu and table were sticky and the cups had a film around the edge.
I agree with the other reviews about being overpriced. Two meals with no drinks $30, way too expensive. Dennys probably would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch. I see that they have awesome reviews for there breakfast maybe next time i would try that instead. 

Today i ordered there chicken tender platter. Simple and easy . The fries were good, the chicken i was not a fan of... The batter was very flakey and pretty much just fell off and the chicken its self was fully cooked but kinda chewy it was strange... In addition to that the chicken also tasted  like it had a fishy taste. Not sure if they are fried in the same oil. I hope not becasue # 1 i personally dont like fish but i know some people who are very allegic to fish so i just hope thats not the case and it was a weird flook. 

Besides the chicken i didnt like, the resturant was very clean and the staff was very friendly. I liked that i got a chocolate covered strawberry with my order. There soup and sandwhiches looked very good as i saw other orders coming out so i would be willing to comeback and try something different on the menu. 

Overall just ok at best but I will give it another try with different menu items next time"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT spot for breakfast!  Ordered the Corned Beef Hash, they offered sliced tomatoes in place of the eggs, biscuits and hash browns.  Let me start by saying...get the hash browns with the Corned Beef hash!  The Biscuits were hot, fresh and so light and fluffy.  Even after 5-6 minutes of sitting on my plate when I opened one up you could still see the steam coming out.  Service was good, food came out quickly, staff was very friendly.  The room is big, clean and has a nice homey feel to it.  Place was packed at 10:30 on a Friday morning, they offered me a hot tea to go after serving my first one in a huge mug.  I am definitely going back...something good for everyone!"}
{"text":"Bomb! Everything's about 10 but worth it and if you don't eat it all you get 2 for 1 since it's a lot. You get a chocolate covered strawberry with your meal as a nice touch on top of that homemade jam which they should bottle and sell. I'm not a breakfast fan in general but yum!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in North Phoenix. The service is great and the food is fast and fresh. The quantities are kind of big but still delicious. This place has great service for being a bustling breakfast joint. I've been here several times and I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes. Definitely would recommend as a great breakfast place."}
{"text":"So excited about the new Biscuits Cafe we have now in Surprise. Have eaten there twice. Once with a large group.  Wonderful service, food OK.  Had the 3 choice. Scrambled eggs and fruit great.  Biscuits kinda on the dry side.  The strawberry jam they serve with the biscuits is the best!!!  Second time I had pancakes with the wonderful Oregon Strawberry jam.  Service again was very good.  Our biggest problem , and I have heard this from other people who have tried them the biscuits are not great, very dry.  If you are gonna call yourself \"Biscuits\" they should serve awesome, flaky biscuits."}
{"text":"Really good homemade tasting food. Pancakes were so light and fluffy and yummy. I would say the same prices as the ihops junk but waaay better. I use to go to the good egg but no longer this is my breakfast spot now"}
{"text":"Terrible. Stay away.  If your business name is BISCUITS - please have the courtesy to MAKE YOUR OWN.  Don't microwave a quarter sized rock and call it a biscuit.  Food is terrible!  We had to have our creamer for coffee cleaned as it was full of ketchup.  Nothing fresh.  Nothing good.  Take your franchise and start over."}
{"text":"The food is really good here.  Unfortunately, the management and service is horrible.  Very disorganized and the manager seems clueless."}
{"text":"Great food and service. A bit on the pricey side for breakfast but will return for the quality."}
{"text":"Has potential, but left a lot to be desired. 

First off, when you walk in, if during peak times it can be a little intimidating and off putting.  It is literally chaos as patrons are trying to pay at the counter while others are searching for some guidance on where to check in for a table.  It's a small entrance and needs revamping ASAP.  After a quick mental recap of the movie DaVinci Code I was able to decipher where one needs to check in.  I imagined the wait would be long, but to my pleasant surprise they do move quick. Was seated  within 10 min or so. 

Once seated you can clearly tell they may have been understaffed. The servers were doing their best, but it did take a while to get acknowledged and out our drink order in.  He was apologetic once he arrived and promptly took our order. 

I ordered the Southwest Delight ( egg scramble with spicy choose, onions, and bell peppers) came with hash browns and choice of toast, biscuits, or pancakes. I chose the pancakes as to me that is the baseline for all breakfast places.  Well the scramble was bland for being chorizo and a little soggy. The pancakes were very dense and slightly above say a Denny's pancake.  Seemed the batter was over stirred for those that know what I mean. A little on the tough side.  The GF ordered the Turkey Scramble and again very soggy like drenched in excess liquid and she got a side of biscuits which again seemed like they over kneaded the dough and had too much flour.  So far the best thing I had was the coffee.  

Once your done you pay up at the front. Which means having to tackle the gauntlet that is the death match of trying to pay in a line mixed with incoming guest looking to sign in and guest looking to pay.  Literally took me 10+ min of standing there while they sorted through the mess. 

While this place has potential and is slightly better then say the good egg. Can't say it would be by go to choice to return unless convenient. 

Really wish I could give half stars as this experience was a solid 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"I thought this place was amazing. We went in for a late weekday breakfast and were seated immediately. Many things on the menu looked good, I had the almond French toast, and it was incredible, but very sweet. My wife had a four (!) egg Greek omelette that was also very good and absolutely stuffed.  Servers were very attentive. Prices were about $10 per entree."}
{"text":"Descent breakfast menu. Large mug for coffee. Fast service."}
{"text":"Was not happy with food, biscuits tasted like they were  from the can, Potatoes had way to much seasoning, had to send back the egg's and the pancakes just tasted nasty..  There is one thing that tasted good and that was there jam...."}
{"text":"Always delicious! Great service too. This is a local go to joint for breakfast. And their biscuits and jam are da bomb!"}
{"text":"Tried out this new place today.   Looks good from the outside and the interior/atmosphere was decent.  Service was not all that great and the food was ok.  Not bad but nothing to write home about.   Overall a 2.5/3 on the scale."}
{"text":"I walked in to Biscuit's Café after discovering Boston's had closed.  For an order at the counter place I was really impressed with the quality of the food and the attention to detail.
The portions are HUGE, I order the  1/2 sandwich and soup and could barely finish it. The second time I did  1/2 sandwich and a side and had the same experience.

The bacon and turkey on the sandwich each time was delicious. The meals were served with a pickle, a pepperocini AND a chocolate covered strawberry. If you order the special of the day you also get a chocolate chip cookie the size of your face. 

Lunch was served fast and they have tropical China Mist Tea. I will be adding Biscuit's Café to my regular lunch rotation!

Oh yeah, join the FREE rewards club for all sorts of free stuff!"}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak and freshly baked cinnamon rolls were delicious! Great service! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Alright, I was pretty impressed with this place the first time 5 months ago.  Since then I have gone back because of that and even bringing others here.   Now I have changed my review because they have continually disappointed me.  They never seem to get my eggs cooked the way I like them.  The corn beef hash use to be fresh and plentiful and now they are skimpy and dry.  The bacon (use to give 4 and now only 3?) my husband ordered was greasy and not crispy.  He likes his toast to be well toasted and they brought them out completely burnt.  It was sent back and all they did was scrape some of the burnt off the toast.  Our eggs were either underdone or overcooked.   They didn't even look appetizing.  The last time we were there the manager saw what was happening but didn't even come to our table to apologize.   So disappointing each time and we kept giving them another chance.  Their quantity and quality has gone down.  Most plates being fairly pricey at 10 bucks a plate for breakfast,  we think now its not worth it. Their motto \"fresh and fast\",  I think NOT."}
{"text":"I met my family here for brunch. We were a total of 8 in our party, and were sat immediately! The service was very friendly, and we never had to ask for refills or extra napkins. The food was so delicious, I had a club sandwich that was made just perfect! My father ordered the almond crusted French toast that was so delicious I will be ordering it next time we visit! Prices were decent a little on the high side, but for the quality of our meals-worth every penny! It had the same atmosphere as Wildflower Bread Co. A bit of a drive for me since I'm in Goodyear area, however it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Breakfast...not Ihop, Denny's, or my favorite Village Inn. My wife wanted something different so we found this little cafe. It has a homey type of feel, and personally loved the decor. The menu had some cool options such as scrambles, eggs Benedict, and your typical breakfast items. My wife ordered the Cafe Mocha which she had majority hot chocolate rather than coffee, very delicious. I ordered Joe's Scramble, I hope your hungry if you decide to try it it was good with a side of pancakes. My wife ordered the French toast and she was extremely pleased! I give this place 2 thumbs up and say try it!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, I had the chorizo omelet and my wife enjoyed her meal as well. The cinnamon rolls are huge, but they put WAY too much icing on them. The main issue we had was the lack of service. Once our food was dropped off we didn't see our waitress until she brought the bill.  Then we waited for some time trying to get a to-go box and drink refills. We figured we'd ask another server, but the only person we saw was the busboy. I'm hoping this isn't the norm."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite. Super friendly staff. Food was served fast and it was tasty. Had the chicken fried steak and pancakes. Mm mm good! All for under $10. Very affordable!"}
{"text":"Customer service has gone drastically down hill over the past year. Most of the time you have to beg someone to take your order or refill your drink, even if the place is empty.  Sometimes the food is good other times it is terrible. The pancakes are sometimes good, other times they are rubbery.  No consistency in anything anymore. Any time someone suggests  going here now I always decline or suggest somewhere else. Too bad."}
{"text":"The IHOP where I go tastes much better.

The food here is ehhh ok. Not that great. I was really looking forward to trying the food here too. I got the egg benedict, hash browns, and waffle w/ strawberries & whipped cream.

One positive note, at least they use FRESH strawberries on the waffles..... :)"}
{"text":"Okay food. Overall, I-hop tastes better in my opinion. But the benedicts here are slightly better. Price is similar to I-hop."}
{"text":"Bacon bacon bacon!!!!! Awesome!!! 

Some of the best think crunchy bacon I have had. 

Been here several times and each time I am greeted with a smile and great service. The food is always fast and has great flavor. You can really tell that the owners care about service and their customers. 

Keep it up I will be coming back for more. 
Thank you."}
{"text":"Located right across the street from my apartment complex, I have dined here several times for breakfast or brunch. Biscuits has a pretty extensive menu and the items I've tried have been good but nothing spectacular. I most recently had their Brisket Benedict option which was loaded up on brisket which I loved. I've also tried their Chorizo Breakfast Tacos which were pretty good as well. Last fall I did sample their pumpkin pie (?) pancake special which didn't quite taste like pumpkin pie unfortunately but was fairly good.

Overall, I like Biscuits. It probably wouldn't always be my go-to spot but it is conveniently located and a solid place for breakfast. 

PS. Midwestern students get 10% off M-F. Get on that students!"}
{"text":"My party of 6 last Sunday and called ahead to get a table. The table was not ready when we arrived. They were swamped.  I had the chicken Fajita omelet and it was delicious, but they forgot my pancakes. They seemed understaffed and overwhelmed. But all of my party seemed to enjoy the food and we did get a table in the corner, so it was not too loud. We did have to wait over 25 minutes for our food after ordering, but I know that is somewhat normal when you have a large table. Kudos to the staff as they tried to cover one another, which is something I appreciate."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time yesterday...while the service was great, the food was mediocre. He ordered the specialty item which tasted okay, nothing to write home about. I had the cinnamon almond French toast, which didn't taste horrible but again, nothing to write home about, couldn't taste the cinnamon. In fact, I've made better French toast. I don't think we will be back."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I'd read the reviews and was expecting more, especially from a place called Biscuits Cafe where their motto is good food served as fast as we can.  The food was mediocre. Coffee was way too watered down. And the service was ridiculously slow.  Doubt there will be a return visit."}
{"text":"We were very excited to see Biscuits Cafe opening near us in Surprise but our first and most likely last visit today was very disappointing.  We arrived just before noon. They were busy but we got seated in less than 10 minutes. The main area was very cold with multiple ceiling fans going full speed. I was happy when they sat us near the roll up doors where it was warmer... Until they kicked on the AC and turned the fan on above us full speed. I will never understand why places do that as it makes your food cold so fast. We had to ask them to turn the fan off. It took forever to get our food.  I ordered mine and my sons eggs dry not runny and our bacon crisp and hashbrowns well done but my husband did not. His eggs came brown, his toast was not toasted and his bacon and hashbrowns were well done like mine but he didn't order them that way. They forgot his milk then delivered a small instead of a large and had to bring him another one.  The food was warm but not hot. I've never had tough pancakes until today.  They were dry and crisp on the edges and tough all over.  They tasted like pancakes that were cooked earlier and sat in a tray waiting to be served. We were harassed our whole meal by flies. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"I love the layout of Biscuits
I thought it was going to be a drab, ma and pa diner... But it is very hip and modern... The color scheme is really cute and the tables and chairs coordinate well... The chairs are pretty comfy too, their types of chairs usually aren't... 

The cashier was very helpful and knowledgable... She asked if we had been in before, and we told her that we hadn't... She gave us a run down of the menu as well as popular items and things that she liked... Today I got the corned beef hash... It's really all I get at breakfast joints... I also got a Decaf coffee... They have a beat coffee and soda bar... I think it is a great use of space... 
Their menu has some range to it, I thought it would just be breakfast but they have salads, burgers, and sandwiches..

Back to my meal... 
It is good :) 
I really like the corned beef and onions.
The hash browns are pretty standard, they're good

The biscuits are yum as well and they come with some sort of Apple strawberry jam

Also each meal comes with complimentary chocolate dipped strawberries... 

No way! Lol! I'll be here often!"}
{"text":"My husband and I met a friend here for Sunday brunch.  There was a decent crowd, but we didn't have to wait long for a table.  The service was fast and efficient.  I enjoyed the coffee, but after perusing their menu, I kind of wish I had tried the cafe mocha since the coffee was nothing too special.  I ordered off of the \"Keeping it Simple\" section, where you basically get to choose three of the numerous options listed.  I did enjoy the sweet potato pancake, but as for everything else, it was pretty standard breakfast stuff.  My husband ordered the biscuits and gravy, which is their specialty.  He wasn't too impressed with it, perhaps because it was lacking in flavor.  Overall, we'd probably go back, but as far as brunch places go, this one was decent, but not very memorable."}
{"text":"Just spent $32 on 2 items & received the wrong item. On top of that, what we did receive correctly, was bland, greasy & unappetizing. Will Never ever use Door Dash, who is supposed to check the order or order from Biscuits. Bland bland bland. I'm going to stop by & give them some salt & pepper. Happy Mothers Day....ughhh"}
{"text":"No complaints whatsoever.  Everything was great but I think my stomach yearns for smaller portions, cheaper prices and Grandma cooking in the back instead."}
{"text":"Read about this 4 star place in the paper this morning. Decided to give it a try for breakfast. Arrived at 10:15 waited 10 minutes to be seated. After another 15 minutes had to flag the manager as wait staff was walking past us but no one took our order.  It's now 11:15 no food yet and my coffee cup is empty. Not impressed will never be back regardless what the food actually tastes like. 

Food arrived, biscuit breakfast lived up to my sons expectations. Waitress  comped my drinks."}
{"text":"Holy moly his this place is always super busy and only open for breakfast and lunch which is bad in my book it seems like they be  losing a lot of customers"}
{"text":"Very tasty breakfast. Got the Greek omelet. They served fresh strawberry jam for the toast. good size portion for the price. Will be back."}
{"text":"I was hoping for something a little better with the high prices and unique menu but not to be. I ordered the Almond crusted French Toast with sausage links and scrambled eggs. The French toast was great aside from topped with margarine and a tiny side of high fructose corn syrup. The sausage served was two burnt to death patties, not links, which were inedible and the eggs were more like an overcooked omelet with a deep golden brown crust on one side swimming in grease. It is a shame as the French toast would have been awesome with butter and a Maple Syrup for the $16.00 spent. I wondered how this place gets 1/2 bad and 1/2 fantastic reviews, now I understand the bad and won't waste any money in hopes of finding a good. No Russian Roulette for me."}
{"text":"I've been a couple of times.  Love the menu but food just doesn't have much flavor.  Also, there always seems to be a wait with empty tables.  It's the last time time I'm going. Besides the high prices it just doesn't seem like there are restaurant people managing it."}
{"text":"First time here and my expectations were exceeded.  The waffle with strawberries was delicious and not too sweet. I had three hearty pieces of bacon that were full of flavor and cooked to perfection. Scrambled eggs were light and fluffy!! I've not had such a perfectly cooked breakfast in a long time (except at home ) ;). Love this place !"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place to eat!! So delicious, I usually gravitate towards the Country omelette. I also love the pancakes because they're super light and delicious. The service is great too, Yasmin is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Nope, not at all what I expected. Mediocre at best.  Wish I could give it more stars but there is nothing to compliment. 

Our food was room temperature or cold. Who likes or wants cold potatoes or eggs. If our server had even bothered to ask, I would have mentioned the lack of heat. 

Our server was so friendly, but couldn't/didn't remember any requests we made. 

The interior is anything but comfortable. Feels like a fast food joint. 

Yes, we were disappointed. Expected and wanted it to be good."}
{"text":"Excellent waitress Amanda, very friendly and attentive. Prices are too high for the food. This is basically a diner on par with an IHOP, but they do professional to making fresh food, still prices are too high. My meal was so so, nothing I would return for. Place was clean and easy to find."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good, friendly people. However, I ordered the Florentine Benedict with red potatoes. The potatoes tasted reheated and kind of old, the hollandaise sauce was too sour and I was sick the remainder of my day. If I do go back, I would definitely order the cinnamon french toast because my friend ordered that and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My son and I ate here for the first time.  The food was really good, great service and not an empty table in sight.  Only complaint was that our table was sticky  but it was taken care of immediately.  We will be going back !"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere,  but the prices are on the high end and the food is so so at best. I got huevos rancheros and it was covered in some kind of chili. The eggs benedict is also slathered in sauce or gravy depending on which one you choose. I may try it again and get something else.... but probably not for these prices. The service and atmosphere are the reasons to come here."}
{"text":"My cousin and I stopped in at their Elliot Road location.  We were actually looking for another restaurant but couldn't find it so this was the back-up.  It was about 1:30 in the afternoon so we were about the only people in the place and they were in the process of closing for the day.  Still, the service was attentive, polite and professional.  Kind of felt like we were regular truckers on our way through Iowa.

Cousin had the pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw and I had a BLT with fries.  Both meals came with a huge, ice cold Dill pickle.  He said his meal was very tasty.  The only fault I could find with mine was the fries tasted a little bit like they'd been cooked in oil used for frying fish but it wasn't overpowering and a little malt vinegar and ketchup solved that problem.  

We each ordered iced tea and it came in a glass I swear was the size of a small jug.  No sooner had we downed about half of it when the waitress came by again with refills.  And the tea tasted like real tea too.

They had Oldies on the radio which added a bit to the country type ambiance of the place.  The menu I would describe as American comfort food right out of the Heartland.  The prices seemed a bit high until you see the size of the servings.  It was more than enough to eat.

This restaurant is in the same building that has hosted several others before it including a Denny's and a Chicago-something.  They feature a fish fry on Friday evenings, the only dinner time they are open.  I plan to try that sometime soon.  Oh, did I mention they have liver and onions?  A favorite of my wife and I and something you can't find everywhere.  That's on the bucket list too.  

UPDATE: When I originally wrote this review there were several restaurants named Biscuits but I found later they are not necessarily related.  This one is located on Elliott in front of the same strip mall that hosts the Tempe Cinema.  It has become my family favorite for breakfasts and does a great job at lunchtime too.  One of the only places where I have found liver and onions.  We have yet to attend the Friday Fish Fry but that is on my bucket list."}
{"text":"I arrived at 1:20pm for lunch was my first time there. Greeted right away seated a minute later and brought my coffee right away. Waitress was nice and took my order by 1:24 so I was excited. The menu said the patty melt was on rye and didn't mention that marbled fake rye but sure enough 29 minutes later that's what I got! Did I mention there were only three tables there besides me!       Patty melt wasn't that good it's really hard to find a good patty melt these days!"}
{"text":"One of the better breakfast options in Surprise. 

The corned beef hash is delicious, and they make a great omelette here.

Service is friendly and my cup of coffee was refilled often.

I would definitely come back and try them for lunch."}
{"text":"Nestled into the corner of a small shopping center, Biscuit's Cafe can be easily missed if you're on the run and not really looking for a spot to sit and eat. But to those who know about it and those hungry enough to check it out are rewarded with large portions and good service.

On a sunny Friday morning, the wife and I were looking for a place to have breakfast while visiting friends in the Chandler/Tempe Area. A quick Yelp search uncovered this little place nearby and decided to give it a try. The cafe is small enough to miss, but does have outdoor seating if needed and a decent sized dining room. 

The prices are fair and not over the top, with both breakfast and lunch offerings ranging in the 7-11 dollar range. For the amount of food that you receive, I'd say that it's a good deal. I had the meat lover's breakfast with pancakes and she had the corned beef hash with biscuits. The food was good, but nothing overly astonishing. The corned beef hash was obviously home made, which did make it special, but the meat to potato ratio seemed to be a bit meat heavy (which to some, wouldn't be a bad thing).

The service we received was attentive, and friendly, although a little sparse, having to flag down our server more than once to get some beverage refills. A manager also visited our table to see how we were doing.

Overall, it's a nice little place to have breakfast. The prices are decent and the atmosphere is great for what it is. Food is good, but average."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Extremely friendly staff and Amanda was my server. Very friendly and put me in a good mood and Not only was the staff awesome but the food was great. I got the eggs benedict Florentine and it was excellent. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"For being so close to home, this is a gem! I got the almond crusted French toast as well as one of the omelets with a biscuit. The French toast was to die for and had a great texture and flavor profile. The omelet had many ingredients and were all deliciously paired. One of the things that stood out to me more than anything was the raspberry jam. The biscuit with this name on it was my favorite part. I wish I could have the raspberry jam on hand at all times because it is that good! One of my favorite breakfast/brunch spots!"}
{"text":"This place has a great breakfast menu & lots of choices. The bacon is so crispy and good! Their wheat bread is delicious and I believe made in house!! The service on the  patio was pretty slow for not being that busy.."}
{"text":"When they first opened they were terrific.  My husband and I have been here at least 7 times, usually on a Sunday when they are horribly busy.  The last two times we were there the food left much to be desired.  I usually order the Joe's scramble, and the first time around it came out lukewarm, the bacon was not cooked properly and it just didn't taste good.  I figured it was a fluke or maybe the normal cook was sick or something.  We went last weekend and I ordered a biscuits omelete and my food was cold.  The only good on the plate was the toast, which was not toasted but heated, and the jam.    Again, they were not busy.   The bus boy checked on us more than our waiter Jeremy.  I was extremely disappointed in the food and service.  On check-out, I asked the hostess how we would check to see what our rewards balance was as I wanted to see if we could apply to our bill, and she looked at me and said \"I have no idea\".  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review mainly to remind myself the next time I want nearby breakfast, not to go here.  The service is fine.  You get s big coffee mug to drink out of which is nice, but a small water cup. Its the food that disappoints me. I ordered an omelet but as I had forgotten- the way they do omelets here is not the way I do omelets.  The eggs are scrambled and then the meat and veggies are are placed inside and then a slice of cheese is simply placed on top of the folded over eggs.  The way I do omelets is to scramble eggs and then place the meat and veggies and cheese inside and fold it over.  Boyfriend ordered scrambled eggs with 2 links of sausage and 2 strips of bacon.  The bill totaled to $31.00 which for what we got- was not worth it."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable breakfast spot. Came in on a Sunday morning and got seated right away. We were greeted right away and got our drinks as we looked over the menu. After we ordered the food came out quickly and was very tasty. Very pleasant experience and would not pass this joint up."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, wonderful personalized service. Everything was prepared so fresh and delicious. Will be back"}
{"text":"There was a 15 minute wait when we arrived at noon. It was Dan, Kai, and myself. I ordered a delicious cup of freshly squeezed apple juice for Kai and I, coffee also for me, Dan got a regular 'ol iced tea. We ordered our food- I got eggs bacon red potatoes and pancakes, and Dan got their corn beef hash. We ordered pancakes for Kai, and as usual, planned to share our nutritious portion with Kai. We waited, and waited, and waited some more. During the 30-40 minutes (seriously) we were waiting, Kaiden, like all toddlers, had portrayed varied moods and sounds. After people that had come after us were being served, we started getting a little frustrated. This frustration on our part coincided with Kai's worst mood yet of course, so there we were, all hungry, bored, tired and irritated. I think our server serviced us twice during the whole stay: Once when he brought our drinks early on and the other while Kai and Dan were outside waiting for me to finish when he needed to clean up. Never did he stop by to refill our drinks or to even ask if we needed anything at all. Another section's waitress, who noticed that we weren't doing so great (we are generally subtle when we are displeased) asked me if I wanted another fork bc Kai kept dropping silverware on purpose, i politey declined but wanted to give her a hug lol! To Kill more time I began spinning kai around in his high chair since it had wheels and the floor was concrete. I had to keep him from crying bc he was very hungry, bored and tired. Our waiter hadn't offered any crayons and acted as though Kai didn't exist. I presume he doesn't like children but there were a lot of kids there... This place did NOT seem kid friendly! I'm sure it was just our waiter but I guess we'll never know bc that was the first and last time we'll be going there! I asked our waiter for coffee and he said okay but forgot. The food fiiiinally arrived and was served to us by a man we had not yet met, I think he was a bus boy. I asked him for a refill on my coffee but he too had forgotten. During the meal Kaiden was finally quiet but even that couldn't make our waiter stop by. It took me 3 attempts to flag him down and still, I'd politely asked for a refill. The FOOD: Dan said his was bland, not anything great (mind you, this place costs even more than Good Egg & they their bacon is smaller than Good Egg' s). I liked the food, the pancakes were almost as good as Good Egg's. Their food is very simple. At this point Kai was getting loud again but I wasn't quite done with my food and my expensive coffee was still too hot to drink so Dan took Kai to the car to wait for me. Now that the boys were gone the waiter stopped by, but, it was only to drop off the check :-( He did ask me if I wanted boxes though.... But this just made me feel like he wanted me the hell out of there. We could've been out there quicker if we had a waiter that'd existed. I'm a sappy chump though so I still tipped him 20%. The entire breakfast bill including tip was $50.... Yeah... That's expensive for what we could have done at home ourselves and better!!! Save your money and your mood for a few hours by avoiding this place... Or just the waiter... Idk..........."}
{"text":"Everything we've tried has been good.   Our  favorite is chicken and sweet potato waffles with a side of sausage  gravy.  The only thing I wish would be improved is the water for a beverage. They need to use a taste filter."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast there this morning
1st time visiting
Will definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"I really liked biscuits before but after the horrible lunch we had the other day has changed my opinion.  I feel they change cooks often so the consistency doesn't exist. Staff is always excellent but I can not say the same about the food."}
{"text":"Had arrived on a busy Saturday morning for brunch expecting a wait, but my family was seated within a few mins. Service was excellent, food was spectacular. The strawberry jam that is served with toast is wonderful. I ordered the eggs Benedict which was cooked perfectly, with egg whites and a homemade hollandaise, grilled ham on a toasted English muffin, and a side of roasted potatoes. A little more pricey than I had initially expected but worth it for the quality of the food. We will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"My husband and I love love love this place!!! We used to go here for breakfast at least once a week but we moved across town so we don't make it in as much.  Service is always fast and friendly!  I love the meat lovers scramble! Yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. The wait wasxa little long but who wants to eat at acplace with no wait?"}
{"text":"We prefer the Dobson & Warner location. Theresa is the funniest and best waitress. We go every weekend!"}
{"text":"This place was just OK. It was expensive for what we got... $31 for 2 breakfasts, 1 coffee, 1 OJ, and a side of toast. I ordered the biscuits and gravy. After I ordered, we asked if they biscuits we're home made. The waitress said \"No, but they are still really good\". I feel like if the name of your restaurant is called \"Biscuits Cafe\", that should be the one thing that is made fresh in house. Also, my husband ordered the corned beef hash and asked for no onions. The waitress said that wasn't possible because it was prepackaged all together. I was excited for this place to open up, but we will probably just go to village inn for breakfast where it is cheaper, tastes better, and made to order the way we want."}
{"text":"This place is your stereotypical brunch spot. Like everyone else here I was not blown away by the food, but the service makes up for it!

This place was packed on Saturday morning which always bodes well. We got a table fairly quickly and our order was taken as soon as possible.

Again food was not amazing, but all the waitstaff was very kind and all smiles! I had a wonderful Chai latte as well."}
{"text":"This lil quaint place is good. They serve big portions. I had the almond crusted French Toast. It comes with eggs and bacon. I couldn't finish it, that's how much food it was... I would say if you have a sweet craving it's a really good choice to get, however, it was overload sweet for my tastebuds today... would def come back to try the biscuit since I got too full and the place prided themselves their biscuits hence the name Biscuits Cafe."}
{"text":"Wondered if this was finally the place that was going to stick in the seemingly cursed location. I'm going with NOPE.

This tired mom opted for a lunch out with my little sidekick, and I chose a patio seat to enjoy the beautiful Arizona Spring weather. The table was a little sticky (common for the syrup serving industry), but everything else was neat and clean. Tabletop flowers, real or fake, always add a pleasant touch. 

Service was friendly enough, but unenthusiastic. I walked through the front door and looked lost for a minute before someone appeared and greeted us. I asked for a seat outside and was directed to head out and choose a table then they would be out after. Even though I was carrying a toddler, I know he looked big for 1, but I wasn't offered a high chair; I had to ask for one. One person brought us menus and the high chair, a minute later another person brought us complimentary lemon waters, and a third appeared to take our order. I don't remember which person I mentioned it to, but it was my first time dining at this restaurant.

--crickets--

I had no guidance to specials or recommendations. Do they serve breakfast all day? Which salad dressings do they have?

Our waitperson was nice, but she didn't ask for our drink order. I tacked on a tea right before she turned away.

As a safe bet, I ordered a basic hamburger and salad. The food was good temperature and had a pleasing presentation. The meat lacked seasoning and was cooked until there wasn't a drop of moisture, the vegetable toppings were ripe, and the bun was grilled and amazingly soft. I asked to substitute mustard for mayo, but I was left with neither. That hamburger was drier than the desert wind. The salad was a spring mix and above fast food grade, so good enough. I asked if a drink was included with the kid's meal, and was told it was separate, not asked if I wanted to add one, so no reason for them to pry out the drink menu. The kid's macaroni and cheese had shredded cheese added on top, and although a little soupy, it had good flavor. Now, the garlic bread - I just might stop in to eat that again and again. It was the BEST garlic bread I'd ever had! Almost added a star for that alone. And for some reason, a lemon wedge added to ice water feels a little fancy.

Now that I feel a little more prepared for the pop quiz, I just might try out their breakfast based on other reviews and photos, ya know, before another flash in-the-pan comes to the corner."}
{"text":"Wow, I love your breakfast. Your bread is absolutely fabulous and the homemade jelly is to die for!!! The chocolate strawberries are truly decadent! I think you should offer the strawberries at all of your locations! Awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a number of times and this is hands down one of the best breakfast joints for the money. Everything from the unique cinnamon roll pancakes to the chicken fried chicken is pretty dang good. Sometimes you find a gold standard at restaurant and don't ever want to try anything else - this place is the opposite. You want to try everything. On top of that they offer a rewards program that gets my wife and I 5$ off every other visit. Pretty solid all around."}
{"text":"Nothing special. And expensive for what you get. I had been told it was amazing, but I found it to be very average. Won't be going back. Too many better places to bother with Biscuits again. 

Waitress rolled her eyes when asked a simple question. Salad was basically lettuce with maybe 3 slices of cucumber, a few slices of onion, a 2 slices of tomato that should have gone straight in the trash. Definitely not impressed. 

Hubby had the fish and chips. Not a patch on Culver's, or Cracker Barrel's Fish Fry Friday."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last week and the food was great and plentiful. The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is they seemed to have some issues with service. Not that the service was bad, they just seemed to be a bit overwhelmed and it really was not that busy. If you have a limits time for lunch like I do I do not recommend this place because as their Moto says they don't make fast food they make good food as fast as they can. So if your looking for good food but not in a hurry I recommend going here."}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars, I would. Initially, I was concerned at the poor reviews but it was Sunday morning, I was slightly hungover and the biscuit cafe was just down the street. First off, greeted at the door immediately, seated, OJ and coffee followed by a decent breakfast. Portions were big. What else could I ask for? Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"Good food & great customer service.  Nice location. I highly recommend this breakfast place to anyone."}
{"text":"Have only eaten breakfast here. Food was really good but the coffee is shit every time I come in."}
{"text":"Clean, open, friendly, can't rave enough about them!
 They have an awesome,varied menu, and the pancakes/French toast/waffles come with FRESH fruit, NOT compote!
 The waffle was crisp outside, moist inside, and the fruit was pertfect! The coffee is mellow, and refilled oftened. There are flavored creamers, and even Caramal Machiotto flavor!
 Everyone enjoyed thier food, There is a one buscuit with gravy,egg, and bacon or sausage that was perfect for smaller appetites.
 The server and manager are freindly, but NOT overbearing. I really enjoyed everything about this place. Everything."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place, gotta say majorly disappointed! The Benedict sauce was over bearing with way too much lemon, the fried potatoes were too salty to eat and the huervos rancheros was swimming in chili sauce. The chef is lacking the concept of flavor a complimenting each other. The one good thing was the coffee! Sorry to say, won't be in a hurry to return"}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak was tender & flavorful!  Chicken and sweet potato waffles were good.  K ordered chocolate chip pancakes but they didn't put whipped cream so our wonderful waitress, Micki, brought her some to enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place, but the quality of the food certainly has declined tremendously since the last time we were here (about six months ago).  And the prices have gone up!
We have eaten here several times a year for the about the past five years.  It has never been great, but it was always decent.....until now.
There were four of us.  We went for breakfast (although I ordered off of the lunch menu) and none of us were pleased with our food.  All three of the others ordered some form of pancake meal and they all said that the pancakes tasted old and that they were rubbery.  My wife's eggs were not cooked as ordered (she ordered over medium).  They were overcooked.  One of the bacon orders was undercooked and one of the others was burned. 
I ordered a patty melt (I didn't feel like paying $8.50 for one biscuit with gravy!).  My patty melt   was way overcooked (very dry), the bread was almost burned and the fries were obviously frozen and they weren't even warm.
The service was good.  There were probably twenty servers on duty (mostly teenagers), so that was not an issue.  I did try to find a manager, but they couldn't seem to locate anyone in charge."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place.  The menu is amazing and the food is great,  but each time I have gone, my food has been cold.  Not sure if it's because my wife's omlette takes a while to cook or if they are just too busy to bring it out on time.  I'll go back and have my wife order something different and see how my food arrives."}
{"text":"Just ok. That's about all I can say. Despite an overflowing parking lot, and the anxiety that brings when one is on the brink of becoming hangry, we were seated immediately. The menu was substantial but both my partner and I opted for the \"keeping it simple\" where you can choose from a list of standard items to make your own combo plate. Our food came relatively quickly but disappointment soon set in when I saw the slab of hash browns that was barely browned and entirely too thick, over cooked scrambled eggs, and bland pancakes. 

Don't expect anything fantastic. You do have a pretty good shot of getting a table if you're having a brunch emergency though."}
{"text":"Love the food and service at Biscuits Cafe.Always great food have never had anything I did not like"}
{"text":"Ate her today and I would have to say barely average. My girlfriends biscuits were hard. The pumpkin pancake was horrible and my corned beef hash was average. A real disappointment considering this place was recommended."}
{"text":"Natalie was amazing. Friendly and helpful. Great fresh food, and excellent portion size. Mine was too much for me. I'd go back, and visiting my Dad, he says he goes monthly..!"}
{"text":"This place has a solid breakfast menu that includes generous portions and tasty dishes. Accordingly, it has become one of my regular spots to get a sleep-in, roll-out-of-bed weekend late breakfast. Not all of the dishes are my favorites, however. I tried the almond-crusted French toast and found it a bit heavy and bland. The almond crust seems to nullify the eggy goodness that usually defines French toast. I recommend the Cinnamon Apple French toast instead. The cooked apples and cream cheese are so luxurious that you forget to drizzle maple syrup on top!

As for the biscuits and gravy, I do find this to be a palatable dish but woefully underseasoned. They have nailed the creaminess of the gravy, but I feel they could step up the sausage and seasoning to make this dish really shine. The bacon here is thick and cooked to perfection, and I have never had any serious issues with the service, although I think sometimes the wait staff needs a tiny amount of prodding to stay on task.

In summary, I'm delighted to have this restaurant in my neighborhood and plan on coming here repeatedly in the forseeable future."}
{"text":"Really enjoy having breakfast here.  Decent cup of coffee and big portions that are fairly priced.  There is plenty of seating.  The only knock is that the staff seems to be overwhelmed and a little slow every time i eat here. Even when there's empty tables service is a little lacking but i still stop in every time I'm going to be in surprise."}
{"text":"The most amazing cinnamon rolls ever. They're huge, super soft, melt in your mouth, served hot topped with icing and butter. Must try!

I also tried the corned beef hash. I was surprised to find that it was real shredded corned beef. I had their red potatoes on the side and they were absolutely delicious. I dunno why they even bother offering hashbrowns, the red potatoes are where it's at!

Service was friendly and quick, no mistakes. Priced were fair, about $30 for two people."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and enjoyed it even more today.  The service was stellar and the food very delicious.  I had the Country Eggs Benedict which was Biscuits and sausage , pouched eggs and a delicious country gravy.  I chose hash browns over the red potatoes and it was a huge serving and cooked to a nice golden brown.  My friend had a veggie omelet with the red potatoes and he said it was very delicious.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. This place is great for breakfast and is a far better choice than IHOP, Village Inn or Dennys. They know how to back to and the food is always fresh. They're able to turn their tables over fast enough that when you're waiting (Which is often the case) you usually won't have to wait too long, however, there have been times when the wait has been up to 45 minutes to an hour. We all know that waiting to eat is never fun, but there's a reason there's a wait. Anyone that enjoys great food knows that word gets around when  an establishment has great food. This not the best restaurant I've had breakfast at, but it's worth the wait. The pancakes, bacon and eggs are exceptional and the other pastries are always delicious. I never give five stars unless the place deserves it. The internet lets us all be critics and rightfully so."}
{"text":"A-OK pretty much nails this place on the head. I came here with some friends Sunday morning. The wait looked long, but it only ended up being about 10 minutes since the place is pretty big. Our waiter greeted us quickly and brought  us water and coffee. Like everything about this place, the coffee was ok.

I had the chorizo omelette. The omelette was a good size, but lacked flavor. The \"chorizo\" tasted more like plain ground beef with some slight seasoning. The hash browns had the perfect exterior crisp and soft insides, but again, they could have used some seasoning. Even the sourdough toast that came with my meal didn't have that traditional sourdough flavor.

Anywho, no one else in the group really said much about their meal. And when a meal is truly good, I feel like people tend to rave. 

Overall, I'd give the food 2.5 stars, but the service was pretty good, hence the three stars. I would probably only come back if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  Great selection of food and large portions.  Prices are decent, especially considering the portions, and the staff is always friendly.  You may have a bit of a wait if they are super busy, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"First time here, now we understand all the 1-3 *** reviews. Meals average $13 a person. They forgot the kids meal chicken strips. Our chicken salad came without chicken. The garlic toast was replaced with a biscuit and took ten minutes to correct. Had to ask for lemons three times and never got refills. There is major communication issues and no leadership at this restaurant.  The problems were with both the wait staff and kitchen. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I haven't had a bad meal here, yet.   The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable.   Their breakfast tacos are unique and very good.   

They are always busy, so expect to wait about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Excellent service, wonderful food,  we love the homemade jam.  After 15 years in the area this is our favorite breakfast ."}
{"text":"I love a good breakfast place and this was my go to place.  Today I went and received the worse service ever.  They let me wait and wait to put my order in.  The waitress acted like she did not want to wait on me.  They actually acted like my family was invisable.  They looked me straight in my eyes several times and looked over me several times.  I thought I was in the Twilight Zone.  The cherry on top was when a waitress asked me and my family to move from our table as though we were a problem.  I politely got up and left and nobody attempted to stop me.  Let me add that the bathroom was filthy.  I got the distinct feeling that the staff did not want to wait on us because we were Black.  This has never happened to me at this particular place, but I have been around long enough to know when I am not wanted in an establishment.  I will never go to this restaurant again and I will no longer recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"I don't know about you, but I like a cozy booth at breakfast time.  They had none at this place.  That is about the only thing I can think of that would have made this place better.   The food is great, the service was bright, attentive and quick. The prices weren't the cheapest but not too bad and worth the quality, for sure. 

Mom thinks they ruined their gravy with the abundance of fennel seed, but I didn't mind it.  Thought it was good.  Biscuit was lost under the gravy, so they weren't stingy.  Mom loves the Joe's scramble.  Huge pile of food.  Enough to share. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"My fiancé' has a peanut and tree nut allergy, and while not everything on the menu is safe and they of course cannot promise the rest hasn't been without contact, the staff truly go above and beyond when preparing food for us.  We have been here many times, and while we have had a few odd ball not so great times, the good and the food out weigh the bad."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my family yesterday and it was an overall good visit.  Our server Kathy was really exceptional.  Very friendly, outgoing, and helped us extensively when it came to ordering my super picky 4 year old's meal.

I've been wanting to try their biscuits and gravy meal but was sadly disappointed when the order arrived.  The biscuits were so small and I felt robbed with the price that they charge for it.  I would recommend against ordering them as it is not a good value.  It was still delicious though.

All of our past visits were excellent and my in-laws have made it a task to come here for breakfast whenever they are in town with us.  Reading the bad reviews really made me shocked as I visited here many times and never once experienced anything bad.  Watch, my next visit will be so bad after saying that lol.  I hope not;  I really like this place.

The parking is atrocious though.  Lucky you if you can park directly outside the restaurant.  Parking lot traffic can be really tough with how it is set up."}
{"text":"This place is super. It's has great big windows and plenty smiles to go around. The staff is very helpful and the food was great. I had the sweet potato pancakes which rocked and tasted the biscuits gravy which were also way above par. The place is clean. Well staffed. Good food and near my house which makes it a 5 star place for me !"}
{"text":"Breakfast on a busy Sunday morning. Service was really good. All staff was friendly and followed up on requests quickly.

I thought it was overly expensive - $10 for 2 eggs, ham/bacon/sausage and pancakes/waffles. C'mon - it's not that expensive to make breakfast! I will say the meat was excellent, but eggs were eggs and the waffle was dry, so dry. My friend had pancakes and those were also dry.

They have a $7.99 pick 3 option with a nice selection - but I would not get pancakes or waffles. I can only imagine the biscuits would be dry, too.

I wanted to like this place. It was in a nice part of town. It was cute inside. The patio was nice. The food just won't bring me back."}
{"text":"Good food and very good service but the place has gotten extremely pricey.  We voted in higher wages and benefits, now we are paying the price.  The bill, with tip, for two was $ 50.  No more!"}
{"text":"My orange juice came out warm,my eggs arrived cold and my server vanished after taking my order. Never was offered a refill on my coffee. I have been waiting 15 min for a check to arrive and my server has not stopped back. Someone else brought out my food, and no one has checked back! This is the worst service I have ever received here when the server was at the table she was rude and short with me. I do not recommend wasting your time or money, you'll get a cheaper meal and better quality food and service at Denny's."}
{"text":"When I was looking at the menu at Biscuits, I was thinking good old fashioned diner food. I was there for lunch and maybe I would have liked this restaurant venue for breakfast better. I ordered a patty melt with fries, when it came the rye bread was barely grilled on one side and not at all on the other, so if the hamburger was juicy it would have been a soggy mess, the server was very nice and asked me if I wanted a recook or replacement. I opted for their version of a brisket French dip. Some places the dip is salty, but the brisket was so salty and tough , dried out ...and lastly their portions are huge but way too expensive for the quality almost 50$ for lunch for 3 I would expect at a steakhouse but not at a cafe."}
{"text":"Would NOT recommend this place! What a waste of money! The service was horrible (took 10min for someone to address us after being seated), they didn't bring the correct food we ordered, and the quality of the food is not even close to worth what they charge. Worst of all, my girlfriends food HAD A HAIR IN IT! No type of compensation was even offered for it either! Plus all the staff was blah, easy to tell they didn't want to be there either."}
{"text":"Stopped by after Anthem Memorial Day Ceremonies. Love the food. Nice atmosphere, but no military discount. (Not much of a show stopper but it helps) will definitely come back by when I'm in town."}
{"text":"A really good breakfast and lunch restaurant. The food was good and the service was excellent. Will be coming back often whenever we're going for breakfast or lunch. No more iHOP."}
{"text":"A really cute place.  The staff are amazing, Kara wears gloves when she gives you your plate.  The food items are huge, you could share, coffee Is great.  Prices are reasonable.Biscuits are freshly made. Wonderful.  This review is true, do not remove it"}
{"text":"Came with friends after church one Sunday in January after searching in this area which is unfamiliar to us. Found this great place (through yelp) and loved the food, service was great!  The only problem was we couldn't remember the name or where it was located...until yesterday. So glad we know now and we'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. I had beef brisket Benedict and it was definitely not vegan or vegetarian but so delicious"}
{"text":"Nothing was bad. Let me be clear to start. I manage expectations based on neighborhood, price, things like that. That is why this place is so underwhelming.

Lets start with their biscuits. I mean the name is Biscuits Café. They were small and lacked the goodness that you'd expect from the name. Not bad, just very, very standard. 

Food is on par with IHOP. The price reflects the neighborhood, but the food does not. I paid significantly less for a burger at the bar next door and it was way better.

In this zip code and at this price, I expect far better effort.

An a more positive note. The place was very clean and the staff was quite friendly."}
{"text":"Tried Biscuits Cafe' here in Surprise today, with the name of your eatery you would think they had a nice flaky homemade biscuit? Nope, a small bland tasting biscuit smothered in a weird tasting country gravy which first has a \"spoiled\" taste then you taste what seems to be country gravy, and it was lukewarm. When I first saw the prices, 8.99 for the 1 biscuit combo which included a big heap of scrambled eggs and 5 slices of bacon. Portions are too big, except the tiny biscuit, I don't need 15 eggs scrambled, nor do I need a half a pound of greasy bacon. A 26 dollar bill for breakfast for 2 is a bit excessive. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Used to be good. Overpriced bland food. Breakfast potatoes were flavorless. Nothing more than par boilded potatoes that were fried on the grill for a couple of minutes. No season, onions or peppers. Two small biscuits  swimming in warm gravy. Ham-steak was nothing more that prepackaged from a grocery store. Bacon was barely cook almost raw. Asked for white toast was given wheat. Told the server was given two pieces of cold burnt white toast. Very disappointed. There are a lot more restaurants in the area for the same area for much higher quality. Longtime customer that won't be returning."}
{"text":"Expensive, not so good food, with less then stellar service.  Hashbrown's were nice and golden on one side then pretty much raw throughout.  The breakfast burrito was ok.  The corned beef hash was a disappointment.  The best thing was the mixed berry puree that came with my biscuits.  The waitress acted as if we were bothering her by being there.  When I asked what she recommended, hash browns or red potatoes, she looked at me like I was crazy and said, \" I don't know, there both potatoes\".  Then when my husband went up to pay the gal at the front was very sweet and asked how was everything, my husband said , uh, ok.  She then replied GREAT!  Sad to say I will not be back nor will I recommend to friends."}
{"text":"Good homestyle cooking. Decent portions & prices.  Took half of my breakfast home as it was more than enough.  Coke products on fountain, bottomless coffee.  B & G were pretty darn good! No brunch type drinks = neighborhood cafe. Will return but so many other great spots to check out!"}
{"text":"I want to really like this place. The owners are on site and I try my best to support small business and avoid big chains when possible. 

The service was always great but the inconsistency in food quality was always disappointing especially when the owner works the line. Everything leaving the kitchen should be as ordered. 

Not a bad location but the consistency and quality can be much better."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. Stopped in around 11 a.m. with my mother. Had a server from a different section seat us at a table. She tripled sat our server, instantly making him bogged down but he still provided decent service. Our food came out about 45 minutes after we ordered (a fish and chips dish and french toast), the two other tables who sat down at the same time and ordered after us, received their meals and finished eating before we even got our meals. When we finally received our meals, they were very cold. The expo area was very overwhelmed (product of poor management, seating guests at tables, which in turn make servers put in, in this case, two-three orders at a time). The woman who was expo'ing at the time, was very rude after we gave the food back. She stormed off to instantly complain to her co-workers about us returning the food. It seemed like there was no apparent management as the server who sat us came up to us and apologized, which is laughable. We then decided it would be best to skip out on our meals and leave the restaurant to take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had my first breakfast there this past Thursday morning.  We were greeted and seated promptly, drink orders taken and quickly delivered, then placed our breakfast orders.  I ordered the pancake combo (three pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon) and a side of hash browns.  One in our party had eggs benedict and another had the southwest scramble with gravy added over his biscuit.  My scrambled was fine, bacon serving excellent but the pancakes were heavy, with an aftertaste stronger than buttermilk (I suspect they add buckwheat flour, which made the pancakes too heavy and chewy, robbing the diner of the lightness of a good pancake.)  I was surprised that the hash browns were good.  On the platter they looked undercooked, with minimum browning.  However they were mostly cooked and I expect they do a little steaming on the grill to achieve that effect.  I sampled my friend's biscuit and gravy and that tasted good.  I suspect I'd go with the biscuit and gravy combo if I visit again.  Regarding the coffee, if you are not a fan of dark roast I guess it's okay.  To me, a dark roast drinker, I found it weak and flavorless.  With respect to pricing, yes, Biscuits is a bit pricey.  $3.00 for rather pedestrian coffee is a bit much.  And the meal prices are about an average $3 bucks more than taste and quality justified.  However there are always trade-offs.  For a bit more than IHOP or Denny's you get better quality food, and a little more of it.  Other than my advice to avoid the pancakes, I give this place 3 stars for service and quality of food.  This would be my \"go to\" breakfast place if they shaved the prices a tad.  Our tab was $55 dollars for three breakfasts, two of us having coffee, one only orange juice.  I gauge that $45 dollars ($15 each for an average breakfast, with coffee, would be just about right.)  That $55 dollar tab for three breakfasts has me still looking for a place that balances price and quality."}
{"text":"Just left with a full belly and plenty for an evening snack. Was impressed with the homemade extras that took my meal to an even higher level.  Fresh salsa, jam and biscuits all homemade! And our waitress Brenda could not have been more friendly and efficient! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food is excellent!  The wait staff is good. Ask for your silverware when u sit down so it is there when your food comes from an expeditious kitchen staff! Always busy so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"So happy we found this place! Great place with great food! The menu offers lots of great choices from breakfast to lunch! I had the corned beef hash which is a biscuit favorite! It became a family favorite for us too! The meat is tender and filled with flavor without the oil and fat traditionally seen with corned beef. The pancakes were a big hit with my kids. They were fluffy and sweet. The raspberry jam was also a big hit! We even bought some to go! Will be back for sure! Everything was fresh and delicious down to the coffee."}
{"text":"First off, I've never written a bad review. I use my reviews to praise exceptional meals and experiences. But this morning, I couldn't help it. My sister and I came in and I ordered the avocado Benedict with spinach and she ordered a la carte poached eggs, avocado, and an English muffin. My Benedict was sopping in egg yolk because the eggs weren't poached properly, the spinach was raw and the hash browns were just shredded raw potatoes hidden deceivingly under a crisp top. My sister's avocado was too hard to enjoy, and her English muffin was burnt. Ps- they charged $8.49 for her meal. She also got one poached egg and one broken egg sitting in yolk on her plate. Our server was nice and accommodating but never asked why weren't eating our meals. We tipped more than appropriately knowing the food was not our servers fault, but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and Manager. However I felt a little conned by my waitress. She described the burgers there as being \"Huge\" whereas it was clearly a frozen patty not fresh and was average size and not special in any way. 

Also had their pot roast soup which was OK and I was served corn bread with it. 
The cornbread is what should have been described as \"huge\"! It was 4\"x6\" Block! Only thing is that it was just cornmeal. No flavor. 

Lastly, going to pay had to take receipt to register to pay which for a restaurant of this size doesn't fit.  Low and behold they only take cash since their system is down. Of course there wasn't a sign anywhere to warn you. 

2 stars because staff was nice and Manager named Marlene immediately said I didn't have to pay since it's their fault the system is down. She didn't try to make me feel guilty."}
{"text":"It's Sunday morning, I'm hungry and it's about 10:30 a.m. I've been waiting for this place to open for weeks, and it finally is.  The servers were super attentive and friendly. I had the Florentine Eggs Benedict, which was in one word, AMAZING. My friend had the Veggie Head Omelet which she loved. The portions are generous and they are good about refilling beverages. If you like hash browns, this is the place to come, they are cooked perfectly and not one bit greasy. The homemade jam was delish.
The menu has some great options for breakfast and lunch. Thanks for opening in my neighborhood. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Just went in to check them out this morning. The male hostess/manager was polite. The table we were sat at was poorly cleaned and after looking around that was the standard. We even witnessed the female hostess Skyler cleaning a few tables and if that was my restaurant I would have fired her or made it very clear the standard. She wiped all the food left from the previous customers onto the floor which actually flung right at us and onto our table. Even after her wipe down there was still food left on the table. The waitress was decent but only checked on us once which left us waiting after our food came to ask for additional condiments. The food looked great but tasted horrible. The food was not seasoned at all. The hash browns where soggy not crispy how hash browns are meant to be. My husband ordered a breakfast steak and eggs. The steak was not seasoned at all and was extremely tough. I didn't even get close to finishing my food it was that bad. Once we were ready to leave we waited forever to get the check. I have no clue where our waitress was but she was no where in site for 10-15min while we just sat there waiting. I finally just got up to go and check out at the front and then she came with the bill. Once up front to pay the hostess \"Skyler\" asked how everything was and for the first time ever I actually said bad and she just laughed and told me the total. Apparently the food is so bad they must be used to hearing it."}
{"text":"Came on a busy late morning on a Sunday. A lot of people waiting! Luckily, the line was moving pretty quickly. We got in a little before the estimated wait time. All I had was the freshly baked cinnamon roll and it was delicious. Waitress was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"yum yum yum! 
My aunt suggested this place because she loves good breakfast. What she didn't say was that she loves biiiiiig breakfasts. 
Everything on the menu sounded really tasty, especially the items our server suggested. Issue though - I alone cannot eat 4 eggs/pancakes/hash browns/etc, nor can my mom. Thankfully though Biscuits Cafe has \"smaller\" portioned meals too. Funny, she and I ordered the exact same thing and both of us couldn't finish our meals - 2 eggs, sausage patties, hash browns, and biscuits. My mom looked in heaven with the biscuits, they reminded her of her mom's homemade biscuits. I would love to have some of those shipped to Indiana!"}
{"text":"Yay for a Biscuits closer to south Chandler! 

My family throughly enjoy their food as it reminds us (roughly) to Bob Evans, but better. Yes, things are a little rough starting out for any new restaurant- but I like to give new places a chance. 

Both times I've been my family and I have had nothing but good service and food- the first (soon after it opened) we hit the busiest part of the Saturday morning crowd and had to wait awhile due to being a party of 8. Our waiter appeared a little frazzled (probably due to time of day) but she was kind and quick to take our orders, and get them out to us. After we began eating, she made sure to come by and see how the meal was faring. When we are quiet, you know the food is good! I was not able to eat my entire meal - one of the omelets, amazing hashbrowns, and a biscuit (naturally).

The second time it wasn't nearly as busy so there was no wait to be seated. The waiter seemed to be a little spazzy since it took a few minutes each round to be greeted/drink order/food order/get the bill. Despite that, breakfast was amazing. We both ordered the pick 3, of which one of mine was a berry mix bowl. Cheers to Biscuits for having something other than melons for a fruit mix!"}

Chicken and Sweet Potato Waffles

The only local location of a small chain out of Oregon City, Biscuits Café had long been on my breakfast 'to-do' list and with a $5 voucher arriving via E-mail for my birthday I finally decided to play the West Sahara Breakfast and Lunch venue a visit, a seven o'clock arrival finding a few customers already present with the staff bright-eyed and bushy-tailed to say the very least.

Larger in size than one would anticipate from outside, the space easily capable of seating a hundred with at least half that present when I finally departed at 8:15, it was literally as I was being walked to my table that my drink order was taken and by the time I'd actually sat down a full cup of coffee was present, a glass of water joining later and both kept brimming without once requiring reminder or request.

Using their own proprietary batters, as well as coffee from Oregon's Edenway and Sunfresh Organic Jam, but for some reason taking the low-road with artificial syrup where 100% Maple would have been a far more logical choice given the otherwise high commitment to quality, the menu at Biscuits Café does little to reinvent the wheel but with many options for customization including the \"Keeping It Simple\" Pick 3 it was with little effort that a large order was crafted - the total still less than $30 before coupon, tax, or tip.

Beginning with the eponymous biscuits, a small and fluffy duo rife with buttermilk that somehow became even more poignant with the addition of butter and raspberry jam, it was these same tangy notes that highlighted a pair of fluffy hotcakes served alongside two pieces of golden-griddled bread, and as much as the custard soaked slices from Wheat Montana Farms and Bakery were indeed delicious beneath butter and Maple Syrup brought from home it was in fact the pillowy pancakes that stole the show, each bite rivaling those at DuPar's for the best 'plain Jane' Buttermilk in town.

Moving next to the Chicken and Waffles, a quartet of peppery hand-breaded tenderloins served over a crispy Belgian Waffle made with Sweet Potato batter for only $9.99, both the chicken and the waffles proved to be far better than one would have assumed for the price and with good brining to the bird plus the aforementioned spice all of the flavors really 'popped,' the savory notes a much needed departure from all the sweetness of the pancakes and waffles, not to mention the nearly 12oz Cinnamon Roll that makes the one at Mr. Mama's seem pale in comparison, the cream cheese frosting spread so thick that some simply had to be set aside to prevent it from being 'too' rich.

Setting aside the syrup 'issue' that seems to mar nearly every breakfast joint of this ilk nowadays Biscuits Café is one of those rare chains that feels entirely home grown and 'mom n' pop' in all the right ways.  Great food at a great price, smiley service that never leaves the diner for want, and a menu that executes the basics with ease while offering diners any number of ways to customize to tastes - that's a breakfast worth going out for any day of the week, not to mention the free Wi-Fi and the fact that they were playing Pearl Jam and Soundgarden while I dined."}
{"text":"Breakfast is the best! Biscuits, gravy, large portions...did not disappoint. Lunch was mediocre. Menu sounded great. I had smoked brisket dip. Meat was too dried out. Go for breakfast! Staff is wonderful."}
{"text":"I like Biscuits Cafe, The food here is reliably good. One of the things that gets me down on quite a few breakfast places is how greasy the food is. Never having worked in a kitchen I would have to assume at places like this during the really busy times the cooking surface is being assaulted at a feverish pace by bacon and sausage. I want my my corned beef and hash, my omelette or eggs Benedict to taste like what it is supposed to taste like. I don't want to taste or experience a greasy combination of everything made in the last hour.
The do a nice job here. The service is reliably good. Honestly I am not a biscuits guy but I do love the homemade jam they give you. I get it on toast. I know it's biscuits but to each their own."}
{"text":"Today was my first time visiting this diner & I came for breakfast, ordering the taco omelette NOW......I solely regret spending my hard earn money here because the food wasn't worth the spend,  my eggs we're runny & full of raw onions YES,  raw onions its like the cook chopped up one whole onion & layered it under my scrambled runny wet eggs and gave me one slice of a thick bell pepper,  Sad thing is I informed my waitress of this & all she did was shrug her shoulder & said well do you wish me to remove the plate from the table then grabbed my plate of eggs took it to the kitchen & to only come back with the bill, with the cost of the overly onioned wet runny eggs still on there....LIKE REALLY?.....smh Not only did that disappoint me,  but also the owner was walking around speaking to tables engaging in conversations to have the NERVES to walk pass my table (which was just me & my fiancee as humble as can be) & she skipped us to go chat to the table next to us to then walk around to every other table as if we didn't exist,  now if we we're under cover food critics they would of definitely gained bad reviews from today service,  so FROM all that today, I'll NEVER step foot back in there never ever again, I do not recommend anyone wasting money there,  your better off letting your teens cook for you,  real talk. But on the good side of things,  the pancakes were great flavored if you over look the dryness....."}
{"text":"we went for breakfast while visiting the area. Good food, reasonable prices, plenty of seating, great wait staff, very friendly."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently delicious! Make sure to come hungry as the portions are extra large. The Service here is always friendly, efficient and attentive without hovering. If you come mid morning on the weekend, expect a wait as they are very busy. Early morning and late morning the wait is not too bad. We have been here for breakfast many, many times and for lunch a handful of times. I have yet to have a meal that wasn't wonderful! If you have yet to try this breakfast gem, you don't know what you are missing!"}
{"text":"My family and I ventured back to Biscuits Cafe for a late breakfast. The restaurant wasn't very busy, which let's be honest, it's only a matter of time before the secret is out.

\"We don't serve fast food, we serve fresh food as fast as we can.\" is sprawled across the wall. Biscuits Cafe delivers and they deliver it well.

Since we arrived around the noon-ish mark, I decided to give the lunch fare a go this round. I ordered the Fiesta Chicken Salad and a cup of the Tomato Basil soup. My family and I were seated right by the kitchen, which is wide open, and you can see right into (and it's immaculately clean), I saw our waitress crushing up avocado and adding ranch to it. That is how FRESH the dressing was! My sister ordered the Breakfast Burrito and subbed sausage for chorizo (with no problem) with hash browns. My mother loved the Chicken Fried Steak and eggs so much last time, she ordered it again today.

Our food came out quickly and it was all delicious. So much better than I had remember on our first visit! My soup was perfect. It wasn't overly salty and was the perfect blend of tomato and basil. My salad was not just made of iceberg and romaine, it had spinach and field greens. The salad was huge, too. I have half of it left over to enjoy later. My sister's breakfast burrito was also on point. Loaded with eggs, sausage, onions, peppers, cheese, and served with a side of sour cream and fresh salsa (which was so good, I got a side of it too for my salad - for no additional cost). It was big, filling, and delightful. My mama finally let me try their country gravy. I'm from the South. I know about Biscuits and Gravy and Biscuits Cafe is right up there with the best of them. Creamy, savory, slightly peppered. It's the country gravy that dreams are made of and is probably an old family recipe. It's REALLY that good.

Biscuits Cafe is a large space, ample seating with booths and tables alike. It's clean, open, and warm. There's really no special ambiance or decor, but it has that diner feel and is just as friendly. Customer service here was phenomenal. Our drinks were never less than half full and our orders were precise.

{"text":"Fast service, great food, good prices. Need i say more? Ok I will. I had biscuits and gravy and my boyfriend had french toast. Both were excellent. The staff was friendly. Food took a little bit of a wait to come out. I'll go back"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, after reading mixed reviews I still had high hopes.  It started when I sat down the chairs and booths have virtually no padding and very uncomfortable if you want to relax for a nice meal with friends or family. 

I ordered the 3 meat omelette with biscuits.

Portion size was great for the price, however the potatoes were bland, there was one tiny slice of cheese on top of the omelette but what's worse is that it seemed like it was all pre cooked, the 3 meats were diced, dry and separate from the egg...

But the biscuits... the biggest fail of them all, I've been around to a ton of breakfast joints in this country, I love biscuits! For a place with biscuits in the title I am vastly disappointed.  You should be embarrassed.  These tiny, dry, bland, excuses for biscuits are a joke.

Will not be returning! 

Anyone else wondering where to get good breakfast, try The Place, Black Bear Diner, The Breakfast Club, or any other breakfast place before you resort to going here."}
{"text":"AWFUL! I almost never leave low star reviews, but this place was atrocious... Good start as we had a nice welcome, but all down hill after that... My husband's coffee cup was filthy with old lipstick & other debris... Then our eggs were WAY over done & to top the horrible breakfast off, I had several hairs in my food... Needless to say, we won't be returning..."}
{"text":"omg~!   solid is an understatement~!   the red potatoes are as good as my brother @tony aguilar makes them~!  couldn't have meat because of lent and they had soooooo many things to choose from~!  we had the spinach benedict. ....the best hollandaise sauce ever~!   then we splurged on a home made cinnamon roll~!   it was double huge and soooooo yummy~!   service was as phenomenal as the food~! i never wanted for anything~!    ;)"}
{"text":"We stopped in to Biscuits Cafe this morning prior to going to a business meeting, and OMG were we ever highly disappointed. For starters, their coffee is awful.....watered down (weak) and not worth buying. Moving right along, I ordered the short stack of 3 blueberry pancakes. Strike two: the pancake batter has sweet cream and vanilla in it, which results in a sickening sweet pancake. I don't know why, but the consistency was NOT light and fluffy, but chewy and not worth eating. The FEW blueberries were itsy-bitsy, and not fresh tasting at all. Our waitress was wonderfully understanding, and offered to replace the pancakes with a waffle instead. Well, sometimes you just can't win. For $8.00, I fully expected an awesome waffle. This was average size and about as wonderful as a previously frozen waffle that got popped in the toaster oven for a bit. My partner ordered the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Brisket, with the side of Hash Browns. The eggs yolks were way overdone, the mystery meat (or brisket) was dry and lifeless, and the hash browns were just plain lousy. We paid our bill and vowed to cross this restaurant off the list. BTW, for an AWESOME breakfast go to Butterfields Pancake House on Shea (Scottsdale). Fabulous pancakes, HUGE fresh blueberries, fresh squeezed OJ, wonderful coffee, great prices!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place FIRST?!?!?!  It was insane and we got there at 10:45...I am assuming the crowd that wakes up late because we did!!!  We were politely greeted and seated immediately.  If your server is Darryl I can assure you that your drink will never be empty and he even brought us a drink to GO!  To say that guy ROCKS is an understatement.  He was on the move and we never went without anything.  For the first time there it was a definite thumbs up and Darryl made the entire experience for me.  He almost read our minds!!  Thanks Darryl!"}
{"text":"Great food, good staff but horrible Acoustics! If you want to have a good conversation bring a blow horn with you. The noise level is unreal. The wait staff for the most part are great, there are a few laddies which work the weekends who are just amazingly awesome. Love the idea behind the decorating, but if you love french toast, I recommend the Almond Crusted French Toast - it's truly the best! With the snow birds back in town its going to be a long wait - plan to go early or before church lets out on Sundays! =)"}
{"text":"We went here after church and it was glorious! I got the 2 biscuits and gravy combo and my boyfriend got the country omelette. The food was good, although the hashbrowns seemed slightly undercooked. My boyfriend got a side of strawberry jam with his biscuits and holy moly it was DElISH!
Our total was $23.12 (we had water with our meals) which is kind of pricey, but the service was so quick the money didn't really matter.
Overall, it was a good experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My 2nd time here and its always a great choice for breakfast/brunch. Bring your appetite, wear your stretchy clothes (smaller appetites may want to consider sharing or a la carte  portion). I had the Scrambled eggwhites with spinach, onions, tomatoes/turkey sausage hashbrowns. My dining companion had the  Southwest omelet with cheese, red potatoes, rye toast and their delicious  strawberry jam (i believe it's  made in house)."}
{"text":"Best Pumpkin Pancakes! Hands down. I highly recommend this place. Affordable, excellent service and extremely good food!"}
{"text":"I drive by this place several days each week, intrigued yes.  One would think with a name of Biscuits that would be a signature dish, wrong!

I arrived around 0900 Sunday, the parking lot about half full.  Seats were placed outside the front door,maybe a sign the food is good if there is a que. Upon my arrival the place was maybe one-third full, you could select your table with ease.

I ordered the biscuits and gravy,egg with cheese, and 2 buttermilk pancakes. The service was pretty quick,food arrived timely. But that is where the good review ends.

The butter on the pancakes would not melt, little surprise as the pancakes were like room temperature. The eggs were cold,and the biscuit and gravy same. The biscuit was like 2 inches in diameter, pretty small. The plate the meal was served on was room temp at best, maybe that contributed to the cold food and maybe there was a delay in brining my food to me.

Bottom line, terrible experience. Who likes a cold breakfast. I WONT be back.

You gotta be kiddin!!!"}
{"text":"Not good...Oof!  They managed to overcook eggs on two breakfasts. The sausage is strange and reminded me of either a poor quality frozen meat or airline food. Their prices appear to be higher than other comparable restaurants in the area and it will seem like an even greater gap once you receive low quality food. Kids meals are $5 and do not include a drink, which is an additional $1.29. They also charge to substitute a kids item or add fruit for another $1.49..so as you can see it will be $8 for your little one before you know it. 

Back to the eggs, our server was an older woman who didn't want to take any ownership for the poor quality food. She said, \"I don't know, I just get them out of the window. I can't tell the difference.\" She did not clear any plates, provide more than a half water refill, freshen up any other drinks once the food came. I did see her spend time at the big round table where they roll silverware (not rolling silverware) and spend time typing and looking at her phone every 2 seconds instead of assisting us.

I am giving one star to the the server who was NOT waiting on us, but saw our table full of dirty plates and did her best to pick up a few before we left. 

Go somewhere else. Anywhere is likely better. This is not to be confused with Biscuits restaurant. \"Biscuits cafe\" is a whole other ballgame. 

I thought no way can this location be cursed! After this, I am now questioning that line of thinking. Maybe if they hire a new front of house staff and kitchen staff they will have better \"luck.\""}
{"text":"Big disappointment!  From the bland, boring decor to the bland food - not a very happy experience.  Only good thing was the service - server very upbeat and helpful.  Understand they are opening in Scottsdale.  Not a very good idea - way too much good competition.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"After my morning Camelback hike, I knew just where breakfast was gonna be.  Rolling in around 7:30am, I knew I'd be beating the church crowd.  I've seen this place get packed, and its no joke, G!

My waiter, Darryl, was professional yet personable, allowing me time to look at the menu after offering a few suggestions.

The chicken fajita omelette was just the thing to satisfy the protein deficiency in me.  That bad boy was massive.  I dont think it was 4 eggs massive, but it was fairly sizable.  That entree came with hash browns and 2 large pancakes.  All were satisfying.  All in all, a good meal for when you're pondering the hand that life has dealt you... you know, when you feel like Ethan Hawke sitting at a card table in Training Day"}
{"text":"If your note getting the corned beef I don't think I would come back. 

I never had the biscuits and gravy so that might be a popular place.  We came here two weeks ago and it was pretty good.  I ordered the bLt and it was yummy.  My husband got the pancakes and hash.  Plentiful food that day.

Sadly my visit his time was not as good.  

I ordered the steak and eggs.  The steak was cook perfectly to medium rare but there was no seasoning or any taste.  Maybe some people like it that way.  I felt that I could have made it at home much better.  We go out to eat so we don't have to cook but this encourages me to stay home and cook atleast it would taste better.  Nothing was outstanding it's just steak breakfast for like 12-3 dollars not with it.  Coffee 2.59 wow a lot of change for coffee.  It isn't even worth it.

The keep it simple for like 8.00 is not even worth it just simple like it states. 

The coffee cup was nasty it still had the sugar and cinnamon from before.  My son said the coffee is good did they put sugar in yours? I told him what sugar and then we see the dirty cup.  He thought it was part of it.  The waitress apologized nice but where the discount or one free coffee.  That would have been nice policy. 

We won't be back there are too many breakfast options."}
{"text":"So much potential, so much lameness. 

Arrived, Saturday morning about 1130 with a starving family in tow. Greated at door by sour faced teenage hostess, told 15-20 minute wait. That is acceptable. The rest of the experience was not acceptable. At the door I could see 5 open tables with 3 groups waiting. Oh well, waited 20 mins, was called by sour face and offered a table in the main walking path at front of the resturant. I requested a table out of the path of every one, pointed to at 3 tables put together next to the window. Her response was that is for 6 people, she then rolled eyes, pulled the tables apart, threw the menus in the middle of the table and left. We sat, waited for 10 minutes for a server to take the order. She seemed pleasant enough. I ordered the ham benidict and asked that she insure the eggs be poached soft. We then waited for 30 mins for the food to show. After asking for her to check on the food. I checked the eggs one was undercooked, runny egg whites, the other poached hard. I then asked to see her, she returned. I said I asked that the eggs be cooked to my liking, soft poached, she said they are,I responded that a hard yolk is not soft, she responded what do you want me to do, I ran out patience, just like this run on sentance, and asked that she take the plate and remove the charge ($10.98). She offered to take the charge off and remake. I said I was not interested in a new plate. I did not want to wait and I do not complain to get free food. She walked away. It actually was kinda of a strange interaction. 

Now it becomes an irritatating experience. A woman approaches the table, does not introduce herself and starts interrogate me about the eggs. I said, they were not cooked to my specs, I would rather not have another order, I would rather not discuss it any further. I told her that I would pay for what I ordered. She stated that she was sent by \"her director of operations to state that they thought the eggs were fine.\" I then restated I would pay for the food, otherwise she was making me and my family uncomfortable. She interrupted stating that she did not want to make me uncomfortable. I replied that it was too late and requested she leave me alone. She walked away. No additional follow up. No refills on the drinks. Check dropped, the charges for my food removed. My family thought their food was ok. 

My wife's comments as we left was, that was too bad we need a local breakfast place. I must agree.

My prediction is this place will last for about 6 months. Many resturants have come and go in that particular business park. 

If the owners would be interested in some advice, you might want to invest in some customer service training that would elevate your staff's competence level to match a ten dollar plate of bacon and eggs."}
{"text":"Based on today's lunch experience, disappointed. They seem to have better breakfast options than lunch...

Service was very slow in-spite of not having many tables seated. Staff and manager are all on there phones, distracted, socializing and seemingly uninterested in their jobs. While we were waiting forever to get our orders taken the manager was sitting at a table close to us playing casino games on her phone with the sound blaring.... Regardless if she was on a break.... Not appropriate for her to be sitting in the dining room playing games on her phone...

We've been here twice and it's very clear where the staff's lack of ambition drive customer service and interest comes from. 

The manager wonders about the restaurant... \"Looking busy\" but not doing anything. I've not seen here make eye contact nor acknowledge a single guest or touch on any tables.

The one table she did spend 15 minutes at were \"friends\" again socializing comparing pictures on her phone and her patrons. 

I could tell that they were simply trying to get through their meals, but she kept on showing pictures and lingering...

We got 2 cokes and after about 20 mins someone finally came over to take our order. James had the California club which I tried a bit of and liked, James being a avid Club sandwich guy, prefers the real deal, not their version.

I thought it was pretty tasty and yum, I would order that perhaps in the future.

As for my Brisket dip sandwich.... A dry small brisket tasteless with brown water as the dip... Very disappointed... I would not try it again or waste money on this sandwich... Waste of time...

The plate arrived, I looked at it it, looks boring, like the manager, passed through my mind.... 

The dipping jux, did nothing but subtract from an already bore me to sleep meal...

After 2 sips in our still full drinks our waitress asked us if we would like refills.... Uhm no were good for now thanks....

After we received our meals and had two nips on my pickle and James had no more than 2 fries, again, how is everything? Well the pickle bite was pickly thank you for asking  and the fries were well fry-y, come back and check on us when we've had chance to try the actual meal perhaps? Or not....

Combined with the service experience and the actual food... I give today's visit a barely 2 stars.... You guys have some work to do....."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday, late morning so it wasn't busy but the service wasn't great. Not bad, very polite but not good. Not impressed with the food. So overall I would just say meh."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here today for the first time after seeing this place on the corner for a while. I had the chicken fried steak with hash browns. The service was great, the atmosphere nice and the food was decent. Overall although great service, my wife and I don't plan on coming back. Reason being is that the food was \"decent\". Nothing to rave about compared to a couple other breakfast joints we've been to that are much better. My wife also has the same feelings about service, food and atmosphere and in agreement. It was a nice try, but that's it for us."}
{"text":"Sat outside for lunch today as it was very crowded and loud inside.  Very peaceful outside, and we experienced great service and food.  I had the spicy chorizo omelette and my husband had the country omelette. Was very pleased to see chipotle tobasco on the table along with several other sauces.  We ended up packing up the hash browns as the serving size was very large.   The sausage patties were delicious.  Overall,  would recommend this place if you sit outside during busy times,  and I might try sitting inside at non- peak times."}
{"text":"Florentine Benedict and hash brown were extremely bland. I used a little salt and pepper with ketchup on the hash browns but that didn't seem to help. The cinnamon bun that they are \"famous\"  for was unbearable. There was enough icing on this thing for 3 rolls. No exaggeration. Only thing good was the water and coffee. Sad too because I was very excited to try this place. Utter disappointment. Waitress was Kathryn and she was flawless. No complaints there."}
{"text":"Wow,  was I disappointed..  Shoulda read the reviews before going in,  but hey I went in with open mind..  ordered coffe n waters, ..  never got the coffee,  but no biggie dutch brothers after anyways..  ordered the corned beef hash w hash browns n toast..  pretty good corned beef and potatoes cooked thoroughly.  waiter was very unattentive n just seemed awkward,  wife's food was ehh mediocre,  would have rather had Dennys..  well,  that n dennys is half tbe price and dennys now would be 3 stars.  

noticed most ppl leavibg without finishing 1/2 their plates..  dont think we will be back.. not sure why tbat corner cant get a good restaurant in there..  must be cursed.. lol"}
{"text":"I just recently had the gastric sleeve surgery. I appreciate the server letting me just get a couple of scrambled eggs on the side, as their menu didn't give me that option. It was fast, friendly and good. I'll be back! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Thought we would check it out as we heard from a friend who works here the food is fantastic.  We are typically leary of new places but today was the day and we drove over to Warner and Dobson to Biscuits Cafe.  We didn't feel like waiting the usual wait time at another favorite location and hoped this place would be quicker.

We were seated immediately and confused as the one seating us, a server, stated she would return with our drinks and then another server came to get our drink order.  No biggie but that was the only thing quickly that happened.  

There were four of us and we ordered an omelet, another omelet and two biscuit and gravy breakfasts.  Nothing special ordered.  No changes to the menu.  

Literally, 45 minutes later, I asked our server if there was an issue with our meal and did we order something difficult.  She explained the kitchen was very backed up which was odd as the restaurant was NOT full with several open tables AND three tables seated well after us had already received their meals, finished them and two were just about to cash out.

Finally, at 53 minutes from the time of order, we received our food which was wonderful.  Spectacular taste, serving sizes and not cold in the slightest.  Was the wait worth it?  Not really but it was quite satisfying.

The manager comp'd our entire meal as an apology which was nice but still, I'm not sure I want to try this again.

Three stars only because of the slow meal preparation and obvious mistruth as to the reason."}
{"text":"Very good! About as good as a breakfast joint can be. Service was very good, quick food service. Friendly neighborhood restaurant, would come back anytime."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for what seemed like forever, my husband looked into things and kept telling me it had not been given good reviews. It had been a while since he looked and after my insistence, we tried it. We came early morning. Not a soul in the place but the staff. 

After looking over the menu we made our selections, for me, my usual scrambled eggs, bacon and biscuits with gravy. My husband got a scramble, ham, sausage, bacon, hash browns and biscuits with a side of sweet potato pancakes. 

The biscuits where soft and flaky. The milk gravy very good, almost like momma made! The pancakes not that good, a bit flat with no real flavor and I wouldn't try them again. 

I was really happy with the tea, I love my tea! This was a tropical fresher brewed and very fresh. I can tell when a place forgets to clean the tea spout! Or brews the tea through the coffee maker! No thank you! But their tea was really good. 

We signed up for their reward program. I got a free gift for signing up. I try to avoid biscuits and gravy due to the amount of carbs, but from time to time it's a must!"}
{"text":"My father and I are in this joint at least once a week. I always see the same people working there which is great. Manager or owner with a flat top usually seats us and is real cool as he makes his rounds checking up on customers saying hello asking if everything is good from table to table. I get the old school bacon and eggs plate, so simple but so damn good."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite brunch spot in the Chandler area. Me and my friends usually go here after a long night at a concert whenever something is happening at Rawhide. I definitely recommend the half hot cocoa, half coffee drink!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this week. It is your run of the mill breakfast food. Nothing spectacular as we dive into foodie craziness these days but fills your belly. Great coffee. Added bonus is they use Pacific NW preserves! Service great, food, ok."}
{"text":"I've been driving by Biscuits since it opened. It's within walking distance of home. On a regular basis, I looked at it and thought \"I should try that some time.\"

Hey, it only took a year! After chauffeuring my mom around town this morning, we stopped in to grab lunch. The menu offers a wide variety of breakfast and lunch entrees, and yes, breakfast is served all day.

I opted for the California club. It was enormous. It came smothered in cheese, with perfectly crisp, thick-cut bacon, and the most amazing avocado slices I have ever seen. The turkey was adequate. Nice ciabatta bread, just the right amount of squishy. My potato salad, on the other hand, was more like cold mashed potatoes. If you like smooth potato salad, you'll probably like this. If not, pick another side.

Mom went for the cranberry turkey sandwich. It was notable not only for the fact that it came with cream cheese (weeeird), but that the cream cheese was--I crap you not--a good quarter-inch-thick layer between the bread and the turkey. She reported it to be good, which was probably true since all conversation stopped once she dug in.

Our waitress was on top of things and kept the iced tea flowing. I'd go back. And I probably will, to check out the breakfast offerings."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch. I'd expected them to be closing for the day (just before 2 pm), but was pleasantly surprised to learn closing is at 2:30. Greeted immediately at the door, seated & drink order placed. There is a small entry/lobby that is very tidy -- in fact, the whole place is. The hostess/server had a lovely smile that was always present. I ordered the BLTA, which comes on sourdough with a side (opted for cole slaw), a pickle spear & a pepperoncini. The portion size was just right, and the bacon was yum! A few people were there, but it wasn't loud. Very enjoyable visit, will be back soon for breakfast."}
{"text":"We typically come once a week on Sunday for breakfast.  We always have great service, good food.  Today we had Angie as our server and we will never go back again.
She came and took our drink order 10 min after being seated.  15 min later, still no coffee, so I went and found her and asked for coffee
 She brought it, and said sorry we were out of cups...... (seriously?),  she took our breakfast order and dissappeared for the rest of the morning.  30 min later, a different server brought our food.  During this time, no one came to fill our cups so my husband went and found the pot and gave us both a refill.  After our food was delivered, Angie came by to make sure our food was right.  When I pointed out I asked for hash browns and got breakfast potatoes, she snarkily said, we I can bring you hash browns.... (seriously?)  Again, never came by to refill our cups or check on us again.  A different server came to clear our plates
 When we decided to leave, we had to go find Angie again so we could get our check.  Not a great experience, never ever going back again.  It's a shame since the food is good and the other servers really hustle."}
{"text":"This is just an OK place.  Considering their name has biscuit in it you would think the biscuits would be outstanding - they were not.  I've tasted better from Pillsbury.  The restaurant was so cold that your food became cold immediately.  My husband's chicken fajita omelet has very little chicken in it and it was tasteless.  We will not be going back.  IHOP is better."}
{"text":"Way way better than going to any Dennys Village Inn or IHOP! Decent prices. I got two pancakes four pieces of toast and 4 eggs for under $9! Delicious the eggs are real and fresh and the toast was way more than you'd get at any regular breakfast place. Pancakes were good size and very yummy! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place , healthy veggie options, good food . Expensive. Good coffee. We ordered egg white Greek omlet with red potatoes and biscuit and veggie omlet with hash brown and sweet potato pancakes .  Everything was Delicious.. Sweet potato pancakes were ok needed some more cooking , were little sticky inside. Waiter was really friendly with fast service ."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out yesterday morning. Typically it's hard to get a table on a Saturday morning but this place took no time at all. There was hardly anyone there. Which seemed a bit odd. 
The woman that sat us was really friendly but someone else became our server. Seemed like he was overwhelmed but that didn't make much sense either because we saw several other employees working so there was enough coverage. 
I ordered the chicken fried steak and husband ordered chicken fried chicken. Gravy in the description said there was chunks of sausage but it was just a typical white gravy. I should have ordered hash browns because the red potatoes, although they were well seasoned, some were raw still. I noticed they weren't cut uniform in size and as we know, different sizes means different cook times. So the larger pieces were raw and small ones were cooked. 
What I did enjoy was the jam that came with the toast. That was really tasty. Otherwise we probably won't be back. Close to $40 for just ok breakfast and just ok service isn't worth it for me."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Large portion size. Boyfriend and I were stuffed. We will definitely come back. Almond crusted French toast was a Ten."}
{"text":"Always happy with the service. Food comes up quick and the portions are huge (I highly recommend sharing). We love the scramblers and biscuits. My son had the blueberry pancakes once, they were amazing. Prices are great too."}
{"text":"Went to Biscuits Cafe this morning for breakfast. The place had a nice atmosphere. Could use a little more in terms if decor.. Couldn't tell if they were going for a more modern look or home cafe look.. They are stuck somewhere in the middle. 
Service was good, but not GREAT. They never refilled our drinks and they forgot the pancakes I ordered with my meal, so it took a while to get them and even though they were fresh when I got them, I was already pretty full.. 
Over all their food was pretty good. We got the country fried steak breakfast and the Country Omelette breakfast. I am assuming it is because we both ordered \"country\" breakfasts that 70% of our meal was smothered in gravy.. BUT it was really good gravy so I can't complain!!  I got the biscuits by accident but I tasted one with their raspberry jam, and DAMN THAT JAM WAS GOOD!! And they must KNOW they've got some damn good jam b/c they sell it by the front register.
The only issue I had with the food is that with a name like Biscuits Cafe their namesake could have been a little more.... Epic, but they were alright.. 
We've been trying to get here for breakfast since they opened a couple months ago, glad we finally did. I recommend them as a breakfast spot if you are wanting a good breakfast for reasonable prices and don't want to do a run of the mill Denny's or IHOP..."}
{"text":"We stopped her on a whim. So glad we did! Ordered Southwest Delight - Three scrambled eggs with spicy chorizo sausage, bell pepper, onions and tomatoes with sour cream & avocado slices. SO TASTY. Also ordered Almond Crusted French Toast - Thick egg bread dipped in our egg batter & encrusted with almond-cinnamon breading and grilled to perfection.FANTASTIC! Bacon is thick and meaty and coffee is strong yet smooth. Seriously impressed with this place. Check it out."}
{"text":"This was amazing! We loved our server Brock!! He rocked! Lol. Food was so good and made it our new favorite breakfast place! I loved the walnut crusted French toast! Sooo good!! I posted pictures to prove!! Yum! And worth the extra $!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I had the biscuits and gravy plate. The biscuits were tiny and way too hard and the sausage was overlooked. Two tiny biscuits, two sausage patties, and two eggs for $10.50! That would be $4.99 at Denny's. My wife had the avocado Benedict and the hollandaise was not good, she couldn't eat more than a quarter of it. We love breakfast places and this had a lot of promise, but we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I had to say that the existing restaurant Yelp reviews are not what I experienced.   It's been 30 days since they opened and it seems they may have pulled themselves together and resolved their issues brought up in the existing reviews. Veggie omelette was delicious and Caitlin our server was excellent.  She really provided the pleasant environment you look for at a restaurant.  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is wow! This place is amazingly good, prices are reasonable and the environment is just so positive. Sam was our waitress and she was amazing, she made sure to have our food out fast and keep our drinks filled, she is truly a gem in this place. If your looking for a nice place to take your family for breakfast this would be the place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the valley to goo for breakfast or brunch. Good is seasoned to perfection,  portions are large.  You will leave there very satisfied."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of hype about this place so I went to check it out. I will say the place itself is cool, inviting and freezing. The air is so cold I couldn't really stand it longer then I had too. Our server was nice, got our order in quickly but then at the end of our meal he was very adamant to get us out of there. He even went so far as to tell us he had to leave so we would pay, but then we were sitting there and 10 minutes later he was taking another table?? Yea that was weird and uncalled for. 

The food itself was good. I had the french toast combo, french toast was really good, eggs were average so nothing special, and sausage patties were gross I left them on the plate after trying them. My friend got the biscuits and gravy and she seemed happy with her food, but when I tried them again I was not super impressed by either the biscuits or gravy- I thought my french toast was better. So note to self- next time a place says they are known for something do not be so easily fooled.

 I do not go back to places that I rate less then 4 stars so as you can imagine I will not be back for anymore medicore food or strange servers."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around. A little pricey but huge potions . Staff is friendly , food is always hot and good. Sunday's there is always a wait but woth it."}
{"text":"Server was pleasant explained the menu.  Food was expensive...$17 tip included for one(Breakfast for Lunch)

Corned Beef Hash consisted of Stringy Corned beef, onions and a few large pieces of red potato, never seen it served in this manner. (Make my own after St. Pats)    Eggs over easy were perfect, toast and good Strawberry preserves.  The Hash Browns nice portion but the oil they were grilled on was on the  verge of turning.   Will have to think twice about going back."}
{"text":"It has a lot of potential and good food but service wasn't up to par. First, they let two guests bring their pet birds on the patio and let them walk around ON the table while they were eating breakfast dropping bird poo all over the table. Yuck. Second, it took our server forever to bring out our food. And i was dry on water before a runner brought our food out and wasn't able to get a refill until we saw our server next when she brought the bill. The bill had extra items on it that we didn't order so we requested that the lady ringing us up take the extra items off and she simply said only our server could change the bill. Ok... Well you would expect her to help us find the server but instead made us wander around the restaurant ourselves looking for her. They fixed it, the bill, no problem but all in all, the staff should be a bit more attentive. They were kind and polite but just a bit lazy. It could have been worse but could have been better. Food was good though so it's a shame that my fiancé and myself won't be coming back for more :("}
{"text":"I love this place! The French toast is to die for, Ham Benedict is decent, the service is always fairly quick and the restaurant is clean. I'd definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD Must get biscuits and strawberry jelly!!! Eggs benedict is really yummy also!"}
{"text":"Came here when it opened and thought this place was stellar. Unfortunately it has lost some of its charm (and service quality) since then but I will probably return due to its proximity to Miswestern...a place where I spend most of my day. 

Things I've ordered and enjoyed:

Cinnamon french toast and chicken apple sausages- DELICIOUS french toast if you're a fan of cinnamon. and those sausages are legit!

Corned Beef sandwich with a side salad- HUGE sandwich, pretty good. The salad they gave was obviously old and wilted so I asked them to switch it out which they were nice about.

Corned beef hash and pancakes- the beef hash was chunky which was different from the mushy corned beef I'm usually used to lol. It was alright. Pancakes were standard too. 

Cons:

A bit pricey

SLOW service 


Overall a decent breakfast place, will return."}
{"text":"I like breakfast but never understood why simple and quick prep ingredients like it, can be charged so expensively. So I don't go out for it often. But this day was an exception. Was happy with BC's portions and more modest use of sugar in their sweet items. Service was friendly and quick. Got the \"eggs your way\" combo and was plenty for next day leftovers. Taste overall was average. Ham steak a bit dry and same with eggs. Husband's chicken fried steak came out piping hot which was a plus. Overall avg. but for the value (portion:quality:price) may be back when I'm in the mood for breakfast outing."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast and had the chorizo omelet and my girlfriend had the cinnamon roll French toast. Definitely would recommend both, maybe I'm weird for not thinking of it but they literally used a cinnamon roll they make in house! Eating and people watching all the waiters seemed very pleasant to be around and more than catered to everyone's needs. Shoutout to John(the super tall waiter) he was dope and extra friendly and always made sure we were okay. I also saw him taking care of a table next to us. As he brought the check and twice afterwards checked on them and offered boxes and cleaning as he went( as in-between johns visits they were trying to justify only tipping a few dollars on an estimated $50 dollar tab) so props to the whole crew for dealing with those kind of people I'm assuming they get a lot.(you know who you are, jerks)"}
{"text":"As the service was a bit slow, the food made up for the lack of attentiveness of the male server.  
One of the better places off the strip to have breakfast"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!

I found this place by accident when I went into what I thought was the side door for Dilly's Deli and got a super happy surprise.

Their portions are huge, and really reasonably priced.

Also, I like how every meal comes with a chocolate-covered strawberry. 

The staff and cooks are friendly and willing to accommodate dietary needs (I'm allergic to wheat).

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Biscuits.  My husband ordered a Western Burger that was humongous! He could only eat half and had the remaining half for dinner. I ordered the California Club which was fantastic. I also could only eat half & saved the rest for later.  Service was great, servers were polite and made sure our coffee mugs were full.  We will be returning as this will be one of our go to's for late breakfast/ lunch outings!"}
{"text":"I had the southwest scramble and a cinnamon roll.  Both were delicious! We also had really good service.  The building is new and has some sky lights and windows.  Very nice.  Too bad they aren't open late, there is a perfect space for a stage for live music or karaoke."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now for breakfast. The wait for a table usually isn't that long, however the wait for your food is. 

We definitely got two different experiences both times we went. I Ordered the biscuits corned beef hash with an over easy egg. The corned beef was extremely dry and my egg was not over easy. It was more over medium I want to say. It took about 30 minutes to get our food and they originally gave us someone else's food. 

On another note they have a very good country fried steak. That's probably the only thing that I've really enjoyed there and would order if I did come back."}
{"text":"This has to the worst breakfast place ever!!! The food was gross!! Although our service was good. First off the coffee was ok and there was no fresh cream only package cream, second we asked our server about the chicken fried steak. He said it was the best thing on menu. But it comes frozen!?!? After our food came we asked a few more questions because it didn't taste right. Everything they have and serve is FROZEN!!!!! Even the eggs are not real eggs! They come in a huge bag!!! My eggs Benedict I took back because the eggs and hollandaise was all watery!!! I don't get it. This place was packed?!?! We will never eat here again!!!! Waste of money!!! It only gets one star for our server!"}
{"text":"They must have hired all new staff!! This morning staff was horrible !!!!! I was walked pass three times before anyone acknowledged me. The server was not friendly and acted as if she was offended she had to talk to me. This by far has been the worse service ever and I've been coming here since they've opened. I ended up not ordering and left with much disgust."}
{"text":"I visit here frequently today the service was less than desired. I decide to try something different today. I had the turkey veggie scramble. It was great the turkey was deli turkey I guess I  expected turkey sausage not deli meat. The potatoes and biscuits with the raspberry compote was delicious. Although the service was slow the food was hot when served. For that I have four stars instead of 3."}
{"text":"What a great family place to spend a breakfast at!  The owners are just wonderful and bend over backward to make sure your visit is perfect.  The wait staff is attentive and friendly. And the food... just down home GREAT!  I like the Corned Beef hash... But everything is good.  My cycling friends love coming here after a ride."}
{"text":"Great place staff is friendly price is average clean place enjoy coming 2 times a month at least with sister and they have a reward program"}
{"text":"As far as breakfast joints go Biscuits is 5 stars. We visited here yesterday for the first time and we will soon be back. It was busy, very busy but the wait wasnt long at all, maybe 10/15 mins to be seated.  Our waitress (maybe Kathryn) was great and recommended their cinnamon roll to start off with and it was the best we have ever had! I had an omlett with fresh veggies and perfectly crispy hash browns along with delicious pancakes. I noticed a few tables beside us getting antsy. Asking about why the food didnt come out as fast as they were expecting. To those people i say\" look around clearly they are busy, no they didnt forget. It takes time to cook that many plates of food. Patience is a virtue and life necessity, especially when dining out. If you dont have patience maybe stay home and cook your own food.\"
Thank you Biscuits we thoroughly enjoyed are meal, sevice and the coffe is good too!"}
{"text":"Was out on vacation from California and decided to give this location a try. Let me just tell you there food was amazing. I got the 2 egg breakfast and it was a lot of food. Had a hard time finishing it. Overall there service was great if I am ever in town ill go there again."}
{"text":"The food was really amazing. I got the Veggie Head omelette that came with hash browns and pancakes... Which is a lot of food for a decent price. Great place for a lunch date and yummy food."}
{"text":"Healthy, hearty, wonderful go to breakfast place. They always hit he spot with their delicious jams and amazing biscuits and meat lover scrambles!"}
{"text":"Very poor quality of food! Basically: it sucks. Any Waffle House serves better food than this joint! Don't go there. Waste of money"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and was pleasantly surprised with the portions of the food here! There was no wait when we walked in, everything was clean and neat.  Our server was very nice and helpful.  We ordered our food, it came out in a timely manner and was served hot.  

My scramble was good, lots of veggies which caused it to be a little watery.  The strawberry jam is homemade and SO yummy, I could eat it by the spoonful, the toast was perfect.  

The server took my scramble back to the kitchen to cook the water out and brought back the ENTIRE meal!  I was only expecting the scramble to come back, and when I asked she said, \"that's how we do it here, we make things right.\"

The only reason I gave 4 star is because of the prices of the food.  The meal ran me about $60 for 2 adults and 2 kiddos.

Kudos to Biscuits Cafe for great service, good food and amazing portions."}
{"text":"Nothing special nothing bad decent breakfast food a step up from Denny's and ihop. Breakfast sausage was a bit dried out. I would eat again because it's conveniently located next to my job.."}
{"text":"Nice place right around the corner from our home.Today we called in a breakfast we had the almond crusted French toast and the Ham & eggs and hash browns with biscuits and gravy. We brought the food home and it was just as good as eating it there only thing we missed were their delicious jam(jelly) thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I am a little bit surprised to see that this place is not have more 5 star ratings. Time and time again we have gone and it has always been over the top outstanding. If you want the best corned beef brisket you've ever had, this is the place you want to try. Just about everything is made from scratch including their fruit spreads for the toast and biscuits. Time and time again we have gotten Melissa as our server and she has always been nothing short of delightful. You have to try this place."}
{"text":"We drove in from SD to visit family and we were told this was the spot for breakfast. I'm glad we did cause this spot was AMAZING!!! 
They are known for their cinnamon rolls and biscuits! This is solely a breakfast/brunch spot. They close pretty early and they were super packed for a Saturday morning. 
Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious and if we are ever back in AZ, we definitely will be returning to try more and more of their dishes. And of course that mouth watering cinnamon roll!! 
Again...I'm not sure why this place only had three and a half stars . This is definitely a 5 star joint!!!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast places. Portions are large though service can be slow. Also had an issue with getting CRISPY bacon once but they are better now. Everyone is very friendly. Tables a bit close together but a neighborhood place and will be back."}
{"text":"The service was 5-star excellent by a very experienced server.  The food was also excellent.  I ordered an egg white veg. omelet.  It came with very generous sides of potatoes and something else, which I substituted for raw tomatoes since it was way too much food for one person to eat at one sitting.  My companion had a pancake/scrambled egg combo which was again...way too much food if one has a normal appetite.  For a big eater, this is a great place!  The manager was most definitely visible and \"hands-on\" in the visible kitchen.  If you are into a \"breakfast/lunch/close at 2:30pm\" kind of place, Biscuits Cafe should be on your to-do list.  Pretty, clean, and pretty good food."}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy are great and the combo plate (eggs, ham or sausage, etc.) is a generous portion size. The coffee was not good at all, but the food well made up for that. Loved the atmosphere and \"homey\" decorations."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good. I like the wall art. We had a friendly waitress. Great location. Adequate parking. The food, was just ok. I had an egg white and turkey scramble. There was not much flavor. My friend had an all meat omelet with not much meat and a lot of eggs! Again, Not a lot of flavor. I'm glad I tried it out but it won't be my first choice for breakfast in the future!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came for breakfast for the first time. Overall pretty good. Our over medium eggs could've cooked a little longer but really that's my only negative feedback about the food. The bacon was delicious. I like crispy hash browns and they definitely were. 

Our server Brook was very good and did a nice job of up-selling by immediately offering a cinnamon roll to share. Whenever someone says they have something ranked #1 I'm always up for a taste test. It was delicious. Our food came out fast and hot. The server also brought out \"recommended\" jams for our toast. Nice job showing off the restaurant by the server. At the end she brought us 2 waters to go with lemon. Very nice! This is AZ it's hot out!

One recommendation would be to switch to squeeze bottle ketchup because you're going to have customers sticking potential dirty knives up inside the bottles when the ketchup doesn't come out. No I didn't do that ;) I just shook the hell out of it but who wants to do that? Nice job overall we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time yesterday and I was extremely impressed. I live right down the street from Biscuits but I only noticed it a couple weeks ago. 
The menu was fairly extensive and had anything you could want as far as breakfast goes. I went with Joe's Scramble which came with a choice of toast, biscuits, or pancakes. I chose the biscuits (comes with 2) and all my food was very good. I'm not sure if the rest of the menu comes in such large portions but I wasn't even able to finish the whole meal. 
Everything was in the $7-10 price range; more than reasonable for the quality. I'd recommend this place to anyone, especially if you don't feel like waiting to be seated at one of the more crowded breakfast places in Tempe."}
{"text":"Our first trip to Biscuits.  Seemed expensive for breakfast, but then the portions were huge. Next time we would split a meal. Our server, Brook was excellent. The coffee was old or burnt. So split a meal and get water to drink."}
{"text":"I don't always make it to brunch because I like to stay up late and sleep-in even later but when I do, it's usually because I'm craving eggs benedict.  

I'm talking beautifully poached eggs, waiting to ooze out runny yolks at the gentle prick of a fork or knife, slathered generously with velvety smooth hollandaise sauce with just the right amount of citrus... yaaaaas!  That's what J-WoW likes!  Yes, it's bad for you.  We're talking about condensing all your daily recommended allotment for protein, fat [50+ grams], cholesterol [500+ mg], calories [1,000+], and salt into ONE SERVING.  Throw on a side of hash browns and a giant cinnamon roll to nibble on while waiting for your dish and its like, wow, what even?  But like I said, I'm not up for brunch usually and I certainly don't eat breakfast during my work days so why not?  It's Saturday.  Can I live?

So I came to Biscuits Cafe for my eggy indulgence.  While I positively drooled over their warm gooey cinnamon roll that was probably the size of my face, I was already fantasizing about sliding my knife across a gorgeous poached egg.  I wanted my knife to mar that perfection hidden behind hollandaise and spew its yolky guts all over my plate as I lick my knife clean and marvel at the gruesome display.  I swear we're talking about assassinating eggs, people.  What I got though were soft medium-boiled eggs and hollandaise sauce with no hint of lemon juice.  My heart was sad but it was still demolished.  Although I did trade half of one of my avocado eggs benedict for a few bites of Southern Delight scramble.  Dang.  That was some greasy egg, yo.

While I do think the quality and ingredients are decent at Biscuits, I don't think I'll be popping in to fulfill my eggs benedict craving.  Dat cinnamon bun doe.  Mmm!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to having breakfast tomorrow at one of my favorite places with my family with the best server in town Kellie but her schedule changed without notice. A little bummed so i guess i have to find another place until she works on Sunday again."}
{"text":"I thought this was a great place to stop for breakfast. Price was comparable to other restaurant in the Phoenix area and the atmosphere was nice. Overall it was a good breakfast with a very impressive menu. We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Being new to Arizona we are still finding great places. This is one of them. I've noticed it in my travels and on Tuesday for hubby's birthday breakfast we stopped in. I love the decor! It's a great atmosphere to enjoy a fantastic meal. 

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the waitress spoke to only me the entire time and only acknowledged my husband to take his order. Hmm.

Anyway, the food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. It's a nice place to get a tasty breakfast. I would come here over the pancake place a few feet away any day. I like the build your own option because I can select just enough.

On our way out we asked about the rewards club mentioned on the receipt. Kris, with a K, explained it, signed us up and when we told him it was Robert's Birthday he honored the $5 birthday treat! Now if that's not great customer service.

I enjoyed our first visit and will be back. Picture of my delicious plate coming up."}
{"text":"I went here with my dog because they had an outdoor patio.  It isn't set up very nicely for outdoors and they could use the heaters as well. 
The staff were very friendly and did take very good care of me and the pooch! They loved him and did visit a lot."}
{"text":"this restaurant is listed under gluten free. do not eat here. no gluten free menu or selections. they need to be removed from gluten free. very very pricey for a breakfast. no specials or discounts do not recomend"}
{"text":"I have to say, I wanted to give this place only 2 stars because it really was \"Meh\" however; it has great potential so I think as they get into their groove everything will improve. The menu for one has a lot of selection for breakfast entrees. So you get your standard, traditional entrees and then the twist on the classics too. I almost gave in to the almond crusted french toast but at $10.59 I opted for the traditional french toast which only had one slice and 2 other items for $8.59. The interior could use some \"freshening\", it's pretty drab. I believe it was the actual owner that greeted and seated us (later he was talking to some patrons at another table) but he was mundane and not very friendly. Our waitress however; was very sweet and attentive. The prices seems a little high since they are just comparable to a Good Egg or maybe a step above Denny's. The food was mediocre but again, I'd like to try other items to get a better overall feel. We went about 10:30 on a Weds and it wasn't crowded but not dead either. This particular restaurant pad has been at least 4 other places that I know of so will see if this time next year if it's still thriving. But still, nice to have a decent breakfast place in Chandler that is not a chain."}
{"text":"The food seemed overcooked when we went. Unfortunately didn't leave an impression to go back again. Had high hopes since it's right by our house"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time. What an awesome restaurant! I had the southwest delight with hash browns and biscuits. It was so delicious and filling. The service was great. What a friendly staff! Would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and family."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time today. We had a party of 6; 3 adults and 3 children. Once we were seated it took awhile for someone to take our drink order. We ordered a cinnamon roll, oatmeal, chicken and sweet potato waffles, steak and eggs, corned beef hash, & 2 children's chocolate chip pancakes. The food was brought out in a reasonable time frame. That was a plus, especially when you got a hungry 1 year old! The cinnamon roll was nice and warm. The oatmeal wasn't anything fancy, but it came with biscuits which were alright. There was also milk, brown sugar, dried fruits and nuts for it. The chicken and waffles were good. However, I think it was just frozen chicken tenderloins. The steak was well done, though it should've been medium well. The corned beef hash needed more seasoning. The chocolate chip pancakes were huge for something off the kids menu! Now we know that a 9 year old and 5 year old can share 1 order. Overall, everything was good. The prices were fair considering the huge portions."}
{"text":"Name is misleading. In fact i would have given 3 stars if at least their biscuits didn't look and taste exactly like dinner rolls. They bring out a little bowl of strawberry jelly. Normally i don't do jelly but it was so bland it needed it. Was expecting a casual cozy atmosphere. Extra tiny tables and cheap chairs. More of a trendy downtown vibe. Everyone's polite and professional, but they sort of hover or buzz around. I imagine their boss tells them to hustle and compete to clean tables. Which is normally great right? Somehow it strikes of a frantic commission sales environment. Anyways.... Had corn beef hash breakfast. Plenty of corn beef but almost zero hash which made it more like the dinner corned beef not the breakfast. Disappointing. Side potatoes good but not great. Nothing really special or flavorful. Food was warm not hot despite arriving in 3 minutes. I think everything was precooked except my eggs. Ordered 2 pancakes as well. Nothing unique or great there either. Little packets of flavored instant creamer on the tables."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and found Biscuits on Yelp....in two visits they have exceeded expectations with great, friendly service and awesome food. Very busy at times but worth the wait. Portions are nice, eggs poached perfect, consider a share on the chicken fried...lol"}
{"text":"Dismally Disappointing. Ordered a cinnamon roll--after seeing the example on a plate by the register & getting my hopes up--to munch on while we read the menu. It came fresh from the microwave, mushy and swimming in frosting--which was not how it was shown. When I asked if their were 2 types, the manager told yes, 1 with & 1 without frosting. Would have been nice if the server had explained instead of assumed. My breakfast had to be sent back. 15 minutes later husband is finishing his and we had to ask for the whereabouts of my meal. Whenitfinally arrived, it was obvious it had been sitting under the warmer for 15 minutes. We had to ask for drink refills and the check. Service was horrible. Food was meh. Whole experience was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here for first time. Hard to find parking but food was great. Portion is humongous, couldn't finish so took togo. Service is nice and fast. My waitress was Kathy. She was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, horrible bakery. I had the coffee crumb cake and a latte, my wife had the breakfast burrito. 

The latte tasted like those from a gas station, the kind that also makes hot chocolate.

The coffee cake had no flaver and the \"crumb\" on top had the consistency of century old sandstone.

The breakfast burrito was supposed to have bacon, but it looked more like bacon bits. . .or really old bacon that was broken into very small pieces. 

Really felt like a waste of money and time. I also did not like how dark the lighting was."}
{"text":"I had lunch before my one year olds Gymboree class and Biscuits is a nice spot in the plaza and more kid friendly than Zipps. The breakfast looked amazing . I was boring and ordered a soup and salad . The soup was Yankee Pot Roast which has down home cooking all over it ; it was hearty, full of yummy veggies . The salad was a little wilted and had chocolate chips in it and i assume that was by accident since there were three. Grossed me out so bad i couldn't eat it .  The food looked really good and might give it another try when i have a cheat day."}
{"text":"Coffee wasn't that good, very cheap tasting. The biscuits were dry and my weren't cooked to my order. The gravy was flavorless and bacon undercooked.
Maybe I had a bad chef that day but damn, was not worth it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast this Saturday morning. Over easy eggs cooked just right, crispy bacon, and golden brown has browns. My brother had eggs with a blue berry pancake and bacon. We both enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and the friendly servers. Perfect breakfast spot."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The place a little busy, but it was Sunday. Friendly staff. Great place!

*****
Update: my mom, son and I had to wait more than 30 minutes to receive or food. The prorated tasted funny and I want able to eat them due to the weird taste. Distasted with the wait times."}
{"text":"Food was ok. There was a hair in my fruit bowl...I have Celiacs and needed gluten free options. When I asked our waitress for a gf menu, I got a very cavalier \"No.\" When we asked about just gf options, again it was a \"no. No options.\" Our waitress just seemed like she did not give an ounce of care. And naturally that really irritated me. She didn't offer any information or care to show us what things may be cross contaminated or if they added anything. So what I ordered was all at my own risk. And now I am not feeling well.
And after that it seemed like she had a bit of an attitude with us. 
Just not great customer service all around.
My husbands burger patties were also a bit dry. 
Don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Recently moved to surprise. Wanted a good go to breakfast place. And found it. I love their French toast. And really good bacon. It's not all thin and flimsy. Quick service and the price is reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I waited and watched for the place to open since it's right by a store I call on and sometimes I just want something besides fast food. I should have stuck with the fast food. I ordered BLT with avocado (paid extra for the avocado) and fries as a side. The \"avocado \" was two measly slices (not even half an avocado); the bacon was limp, the fries greasy and cold and the tomato was underripe. My bill was over $12.00 for $3.00 worth of edible food. The toast was okay. Never again. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Little weary after seeing the initial stars on Yelp. But after ordering and getting the food it exceeded our expectations. Service was a little slow but coffee and water stayed full. Everyone in our party was happy with their meal and would for sure come back again."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here several times for breakfast.  We live fairly near by, but we would travel pretty far to enjoy a meal here.  Friendly service, great food and a big variety.  I especially love their homemade raspberry jam served with toast and biscuits.  I've had the country omelette with the gravy - wonderful!"}
{"text":"Bad news the old man who ownes these restaurants does not care about the customer reviews. Upper management are a bunch  of kids who have no education on how to run a 17 restaurants. Spend your money at egg & jo or some place that is not ran by grandpas kids who are clueless. I was a regular customer who left because when a man who knew how to treat customers and his staff was let go because the owner was cheep I was done."}
{"text":"Always love having breakfast or brunch here. The food and service are very enjoyable and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This place was actually not bad at all... I had gotten kind of scared before because of the low 3.5 star rating as well as looking at the pictures of the food other helpers had posted (I am a very visual person) but I happened to be by this place and I was stuck in that area and was hungry so I thought I would give it a try. We had chicken and waffles, eggs Benedict with ham & children's menu pancake with bacon and eggs. When i first looked at the pancake, I was a bit concerned, it looked a bit thick and doughy and imperfect... But when i tasted it, it was delicious! The bacon was good as well, thick and crispy! Definitely not the cheap kind. The waffles were delicious as well, light and crunchy, just the way I like it. The chicken fingers were good enough for the teenager. And also, the kids meal was a pretty good size for a kids meal. The eggs Benedict were ok as well. Service- good. Price range- around $10 per meal on average. Ambience- was so-so... Clean enough, but nothing fancy, could use a bit of improvement but definitely not a make or break type of deal. The drinks though- My iced tea was just so-so and needed more ice. So I guess overall they just need to improve on presentation and aesthetics. But my recommendation definitely is to give this place a try. You might just be delighted!"}
{"text":"I had always wanted to eat here and got the chance today. The service was fine but the food was not great.  If you name your restaurant BISCUITS then they should be memorable.  These were perhaps the worst biscuit ive ever had. Hard dry..KFC biscuit are better! My ehgs were way undercooked and my bacon was cooked I think last week. Im disappointed and will nor be coming back. Nor should you go either.."}
{"text":"Now this place is worth the drive.  Sunday morning a little busy, but that's what happens when its a good place.  We go after church."}
{"text":"These days this is my favorite GO TO Sunday breakfast!! There are many good things about this place.

1. Good service!! The staff is cheerful and accommodating.  I hate walking into a restaurant and not being acknowledged because the staff is too \"busy\" to say a quick welcome. RUDE!! But this place always greets and updates you on how long your wait would be.
2. GOOD food!! My fave on the menu is the Almond Crusted French Toast!! It's great to find a restaurant that adds something different to their menu. I love that it's not that rich but full of flavor.  AMAZING!! Last week I had the blueberry pancakes. NOM NOM!!
3.  Ample parking! The parking lot gets full but the turn around is great and I always find a spot.

Thank you Biscuits Cafe!! I can never get sick of you :)"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast with the intention of staying a few hours to study.  I had an omelette which was okay, but the  waiters kept coming by to see if I was okay after I had finished their food and was studying...even though there was hardly anyone else there."}
{"text":"I do not understand the great reviews of this place. If your namesake is \"Biscuits\", maybe you should do those exceptionally well? Or at least modestly well? The biscuits were small, terrible, expensive and slow to arrive. The rest of breakfast wasn't great either. The waitress was clueless to the menu items."}
{"text":"This restaurant was just opened up a week ago and it is already packed when I got here this morning. The restaurant is clean, organized and spacious. Service is as good as you are going to get since they are super busy. The crowd was super loud, I could barely hear our conversation.  Majority of the customers are elders and retired folks... (interesting). I don't know if I would bring my friends to hang out here. The receptionist area is so crowded and unorganized I did not even know who to speak with and get a table. It was chaotic. Neverthelsss, we got seated fairly quickly. 

The flavor of the food was VERY disappointing. I ordered a berry waffle with two eggs and sausages. The waffle was not all the way cooked. It was smushy and tasteless even after adding lots of syrup on it. Sausages were tasteless. I know I was eating waffles and sausages but yet I couldn't taste any of it. The gravy that my friend had isn't as good as other location neither. Overall, we are very disappointed in what we had. 

We did see the owner walking around saying hi to \"selective tables\". It would have been nice if he bothered to stop by and asked us how we are going instead of skipping us over....Him and I crossed eye contact once. His smile was so not genuine maybe it is better off that he didn't bother talking to us. 

Since it is their first week grand opening, we will come back here and try it again in a few weeks. Hopefully the food and the atmosphere will change on my our next visit."}
{"text":"Brought my husband and kids here for what was supposed to be a nice family breakfast. Average bland food with mediocre decor. Obviously understaffed for a weekend.  And who runs out of ice?!!  Really. 
Waited for 40 minutes to be seated (expected), waited another 45 minutes for the food (ridiculous). And by the time we got it, it was cold.  Not worth it!  Don't waste your time waiting here."}
{"text":"Good choice for a breakfast place that doesn't get as crowded as other places.  Not so trendy, maybe, or just because it's right next to LA Fitness and most people don't want to get caught stuffing their mouths right next to the gym?  The food is good and the portions are ginormous like other breakfast places.
I do enjoy their home-made jam (which they sell). The raspberry one was amazing.  
Has a patio, so that's good."}
{"text":"Me and my girl just had breakfast it was great got here close to closing time service was great. Will be back"}
