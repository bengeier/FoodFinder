{"text":"It's the second time I've been to Uncle Mikeys and the good was outstanding.  We tried judy about everything on the menu and everything was really, really tasty and unique. Fanatic selection of sake and great service."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with a friend. Ambiance was great with dimmed lights and Korean fusion decor.  Food was interesting. Best dish on the menu was the kimchi rice bowl with added pork belly. Pork belly was cooked really well with amble amounts of fat, which I loved. Eggplant side dish was alright. Tripe was alright. Dessert was amazing! Had some caramelized cheese with blueberries for dessert. I would highly recommend their sale flight. Delicious and clean!! High quality sakes and better than some other places in Toronto lol.  I'd come back for more sake and for more dessert!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for Tapas. That's all you need to know (and this comes from a food snob)"}
{"text":"Quiet, modern Korean tapas bar. Staff were incredibly attentive, my 2-yo spilled his water, and they immediately began wiping the spill off our table and the ground.  We ordered 7 dishes in total (onigiri, soy egg, smashed cucumber, starving artist, kimchi pancake, oxtail gnocchi, blueberry mascarpone ice cream), and would definitely order any of the dishes again if we come back.  Callout is the oxtail gnocchi.  Gnocchi is lightly deep-fried, and covered in a very well-seasoned oxtail gravy.  Not quite Italian, not quite Korean.  Does it really matter what cuisine the dish is labelled?  Just get it, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Wow!  Food, excellent!!  Drinks, amazing!!! Atmosphere, on point! A nice change from the space before Uncle Mikey's has created a space that is all their own. Combining French and European techniques with Korean ingredients this place is sure to be a hotspot on the Dundas West strip. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Went there for a late dinner and the service was amazing, food was so reasonably priced and SO DELICIOUS. There wasn't a drop of sake or a piece of rice left on the plate after we were done with it. Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food, drinks and servers were all on point. I also loved that they played jazz and other nice music and that the level was not too loud so we could enjoy the food and conversation.  My one complaint is I wish they would open on Sunday/Monday for industry night and maybe even have later hours and drink/food specials!!!"}
{"text":"The menu is creative and delicious. The service is very friendly and pleasant. I really enjoyed dining at Uncle Mikey's and would definitely go back again soon."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!   My friends and I have had lots of Korean food and tapas food in Toronto and this one so far does the best job combining the two! It's authentic, modern, well-executed,and delicious. Highly recommend coming in during their Happy Hour Tuesday to Saturday 5-7pm ( they close on Sunday and Monday) when you can enjoy $5 snacks and special drinks.   We ordered Halloumi Tomato Salad, Origiri, Soy eggs, kimchi pancake, albacore tuna, steak lettuce wrap, and chicken wings. They all sound pretty simple but you can tell every dish is well thought of from the presentation, the complexity of flavours, and the different combinations of dressing/sauces they bring to you.   The Halloumi Tomato Salad come with crispy taro strains and fried ginger crumbles which adds to the texture while the dish remains a very refreshing simmer dish.   The dipping sauces that came with origiri (rice balls) was mayo and wasabi were such a great complement to the lightly fried butter glazed rice ball.   The kimchi pancake has nice crispy texture, and if you mix it with the spicy dipping sauce (with sriracha) and the mayo and wasabi from the origiri, it taste even better - like heaven!   The albacore tuna was nicely seared, and we really liked the cucumber and strawberry slices that came with it. It's so refreshing.   The chicken wings were without a doubt super awesome too. Interesting garnish that came with it is pickled chayote. In China we've always stir fry slices of this melon and this is the first time I had it pickled. It has a texture that's somewhere between pickled cucumber and pear. Very nice add-on to the fried wings.   Over all we were super impressed and really enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of fusion, specially asian fusion so I could not skip out on trying this place. The West Queen/Dundas West is definitely the hub of them fusion and I love hanging out in this area exploring.  I went here with a friend on a Thursday night and we were seated right away. The interior is a bit dim to make it a typical bar i guess but it was difficult to take photos of the place and the food. My friend and I had to light each other up lol. The staff were very friendly and courteous. It's tapas style so small portion to share. We got four things on the menu, okay five including dessert and yes, they were good fusion food.  We got the Parisian gnocchi, pork belly rice bowl, pork katsu, and ssam plate. Good gnocchi texture, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was unbelievable. The ssam was melts in your mouth meat. The pork belly was tasty and the rice is so delicately good. I know the rice gets snobbed on most rice dishes but I tell you that the rice in the rice bowl was cooked to perfection. The dessert was caramel tasting ice cream and it was creamy. This korean tapas bar is definitely on my list of my go to eats."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying out this new restaurant and I absolutely loved every single dish I tried (which is almost everything on the menu!!!!). The dishes are Asian inspired with an American twist. Every dish is really creative, tasty and made to perfection. The staff are nice and friendly. I had the following dishes and would absolutely order these items again:  Smashed cucumber:  this cold dish is similar to what you can get at all Koreans restaurants with it's own twist of peanuts and black sesame. If you like this dish at your local favourite Korean restaurant then this still worth a try.  Kare trippa: this was my favourite dish of the night! Tripe simmered in a curry sauce served with toast. The tripe was the melt in your mouth kind of softness and extremely tasteful. Even the toast alone was good.  Katsu: porkshop served with a peppercorn sauce and cabbage salad. The porkchop was really crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The meat is not dry at all.  Corn: I normally don't order corn at a restaurant but I am glad I gave this a try. This dish is served off the cob and the corn is sweet (the perfect kind of sweet for a good corn) with kimchi and feta cheese.   Ssam: Korean bar snack called bossam. The steak was tender and melts in your mouth. SO GOOD!  Parisian gnocchi: a twist of European made with oxtail sauce. Such an unique dish.   I also had the tomatoes and the egg. Unfortunately, I do not remember the names of these items. The tomatoes and egg were really good especially for something as simple as these items. I would normally never think to order a tomato dish or the egg even. I really underestimated the egg and I was definitely left impressed.   Food (Taste): 5/5 Food (Presentation): 5/5 Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5"}
{"text":"Honestly some of the of the most bomb ass shit I've had in a while...and that's saying a lot!  Everything is tasty af and reasonably portioned. Loved the gnocchi, shishito's (!!), and the pork belly bibimbap?   We also had a great sake flight with delicious sake and three different cute glasses.  Very chill spot. Definitely recommended and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Strolled in late Friday evening, place was busy, the staff made room and seated us quickly. Attentive and friendly staff.. and amazing modern Korean cuisine. The strawberry infused sake was very nice too. Definitely recommend and will be back :)"}
{"text":"4.5/5, based on one visit.   Me and my friend shared the tripe, chicken gizzards, wings, steak tartare, and bulgogi gnocchi. I also opted to try their sake flight special. I have to say...everything that we had was cleverly conceived, smartly presented, and loaded with strong, interesting flavors. Standout dish would probaly be the gnocchi. Service was kind and attentive. Atmosphere is definitely more on the low-lit/low-key side, meaning that it can double as a date place and as spot to hang out with a small group of friends."}
{"text":"One of my fav restaurants in the hood.   Everything on the menu is well executed and priced. My impossible to please family can't stop raving about this place. That's like never happened. Ever.   - chicken wing (15/10) - you got that. 15! - soy egg (10/10) - cucumber salad (9/10) - starving artist (10/10) - kimchi pancake (10/10) - ox tail gnocchi (9/10) - kimchi bowl with pork belly (8/10) - Katsu (9/10) - service (10/10)  The rice ball was a little disappointing but, did you see the ratings for the rest, there should be protests in the street if this place were to ever leave!"}
{"text":"Our group of 5 got the mushrooms, tartare, kimchi pancake, mapo tofu, peanut noodles, gnocchi, ssam, and special which was risotto. Everything was good but the mushrooms, tofu, and tartare especially were amazing. Strong flavors, I was a big fan. Staff was great as well."}
{"text":"I wanted to see what the high praises were all about so I came here on on a week night but the restaurant was half empty.   Price is quite expensive while the portion is incredibly small. Their dishes are hyped up as I find them tasting okay/mediocre. Service on the other hand was really good. The washroom in the basement is a bit sketchy and run down.  We ordered:  Chicken Wings - three marinated chicken wings. They were okay. I prefer Korean fried chicken at elsewhere  Oxtail Gnocchi - this one was pretty good but portion was bite-sized  Starving Artist Noodles - this dish I had the most problem with. It was literally just noodles drenched in peanut sauce in which i can make at home. Nothing special. Over-priced.   In all, Uncle Mikey's was a good restaurant to check out, do they live up to the hype? I personally don't think so. The reviews they received were too generous."}
{"text":"Well deserved 5 star rating. My wife and I love this place !! Great food , staff and atmosphere !"}
{"text":"The food here is simply delicious. We ordered majority of the dishes on menu on that day, each of them tasted amazing. More importantly, they all had their distinct taste. The rice ball, egg, starving artist noodles are three simplest Asian dishes you could find in a lot of Asian restaurants, Chef Mike had his own touch, and they are one of the best I've ever tasted. He also made us an off the menu dish, kimchi gnocchi, that was superb! Service was great and the restaurant is perfectly decorated to provide a relaxed and cozy feel. They also  have a great drinks menu to select from, especially their sakes! Great place to hang out after work or chill on the weekend."}
{"text":"Great food, chill vibe, yummy sake, fun playlist. Service is friendly and very helpful with educating us about the different sake. Food came out at a great pace and everything was cooked and seasoned well. I will definitely be returning here in the future.   Pro tip: mix the smashed cucumber sauce with your starving artist noodles!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just got back after one of the best meals we've had in an incredibly long time. Uncle Mikey's is a great date spot, with a relaxed and unpretentious ambiance, very attentive and friendly service, a soild drink list, and really tasty food.  We split the soy egg and onigiri to start, both of which were delicious, then we each had kimchi rice bowls -- his with pork belly, mine with tofu. Yeah, we could have had different dishes, but honestly, these were so good that we would have probably ordered a second one anyway. The kimchi, crispy onions, and pickled cucumber were the absolute perfect mix. Add rice and a little sriracha and you have something that's light enough but still satisfying and probably equally appealing in the dead of summer or on a cold winter night.  For dessert, we had the ice cream with crispy rice and the grilled pineapple with lime, mint, and meringue. I don't remember the ice cream flavour, but it was a little caramel-ish without being overwhelming, and the topping added just the right amount of crunch. That said, the pineapple was probably the winner. It was just so fresh and simple, but also really memorable.  We're so happy to have Uncle Mikey's in the neighbourhood. Everything on the menu looks incredible and we can't wait to go back and try more. It's closed tomorrow and Monday, but maybe Tuesday? Maybe."}
