{"text":"It might be a bit unfair to review Globe so early into their existence, but I don't feel too badly about it. Reason being, this isn't their first restaurant opening. Globe has two other locations, so it's owners should be able to avoid the rookie mistakes of opening a restaurant. But rather than focus on the facts that it smelled like a construction site, the floors and walls needed some minor finishing work, the staff were wandering about looking slightly confused and a little scared, and the place generally seemed like it probably wasn't ready to open just yet, I'm going to put all that aside and focus on the rest of Globe.

Globe's focus is on local stuff; that means they try to only serve products that are made close-to-home. Trouble is, I'm not exactly sure how far that close-to-home boundary extends to. I was told that it includes Ontario as a whole, but it could also go much further East or West; their Albacore tuna, for example, comes from BC and their mussels come from PEI. Other items don't explicitly explain where they come from, like the Cornish hen. That's the difficulty with going local though; right-off-the-bat you need to firmly establish your local boundaries. BC and PEI, after all, aren't right around the corner. Why not Maine lobster? Maine is a lot closer and seems a lot more local to me than anywhere in BC.

I suppose my beef here is that if you want to focus on locally produced stuff, then why not do it right down to the last detail? Why have a couple of wines from Italy and the US when you could easily make a wine menu completely from Niagara Peninsula wines or even from West Coast British Columbia (since we haven't yet established where that local line is drawn). I suppose the entire local concept is pretty hot right now, considering the whole farm-to-table trend, but those places are a bit more sincere by growing and sourcing everything onsite. To me, that's what true local eating is all about: setting firm boundaries.

The main thing that caught me right away-even more so than the local-ness of stuff-was the truly reasonable prices. At my initial walk-in to the beautiful dining room, I expected to pay a bit more, but that wasn't the case at all. Starters are around 11 bucks, entrees are around 22; at prices like that, it's even kind of refreshing, considering how elegant both the dining room and bar spaces are. And the food is good too. The local carnivore flatbread, for example, had a perfectly cooked flatbread base with some delicious, good-quality meats. The baked Spring vegetable tart seemed a little strange served on raw spinach, but the contrast worked nicely together.

The dining room space is beautiful. 20 foot ceilings, elegant lighting, solid wooden tables. In terms of sheer ambience and sophistication, there's nothing in Bloor West Village that can even come close to competing with Globe.

Despite the wandering servers, we were lucky enough to have the only one that seemed focused. Even though the meddling manager kept needlessly hovering over us mere seconds each time before our server got there, we had fantastic service that pretty much made the entire experience better. If we had another server, I probably would have thought a lot less.

Truth be told, Globe's focus on local products seems to be more of a gimmick at this point rather than a passion. However despite that, it was a pretty good overall experience, opening jitters and stage fright aside. I think that once they work all the kinks out, there'll be nothing in Bloor West Village-an area that is really hurting for some good restaurants to begin with-that can even come close to competing with Globe."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Earth since we're in the neighbourhood and eat local, organic as much as possible. When I found a groupon to try out the 4 course prix fixe, we were sold! The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the service was good but the food was not executed properly. It's almost as though the dishes are good in theory/concept but the taste is off (either too bland, too salty). I can only compare it to a first year culinary student's efforts. We left feeling disappointed and will likely not go again."}
{"text":"Went for dinner a couple of weeks ago and while I wasn't blown away, I enjoyed it enough to want to return for brunch this weekend.

I found the appetizers to be a little underwhelming.  My friend and I split the \"crispy curds\" (tempura battered cheese curds) and the \"pig bits\" (charcuterie plate).  The cheese was definitely one of those things that sounded way better than the reality and the charcuterie plate, while good, was quite small.

The mains however, more than made up for the apps.  I had the rainbow trout which was perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth good.  My friend had the cornish hen.  I wasn't able to try any but I assume it was good because he didn't talk to me for a good ten minutes while he focused on his plate. :-)

The service was excellent.  The space itself is beautiful but HUGE.  We could really feel how big it was because it was fairly empty on a Wednesday night.  I wouldn't recommend it for an intimate dinner unless you go to the wine bar side which seemed much more cozy.

Looking forward to brunch this weekend if only to watch one of the guys in the group order the Swine and Dine (pork SIX ways?! c'mon!)."}
{"text":"So once again l found myself at Earth Bloor West, the first time I went with a bunch of mommy friends for some drinks and appetizers on the rooftop patio. The first impression was so, so and I got home and told my husband that we will have to go and check it out for dinner and see what this place was all about.

Well that time came around and thank goodness for a Wag jag deal we found online and we headed out for the 4 course Fall Harvest Menu. We got to the restaurant and we were seated across from the bar (thank goodness it wasn't busy otherwise I would have been pissed off)

Our waitress came right away and asked us if we wanted something to drink, which I found to be very hands on and eager but alas it's most likely part of the training. We ordered a big bottle of San Pellegrino while we scrolled through the menu to see what we were going to eat.

There were 2 soup options, 2 salad options, 4 main meal options and 2 dessert options. We placed our orders at once so we could get our meal on a roll. I opted for the french onion soup with an Earth Restaurant twist as the waitress stated and my husband went for the Italian Wedding soup that also had an Earth twist......I guess everything has an Earth Restaurant twist....LOL

Both soups were delicious and the portions were huge for soup, and it was all good, my husband said he wouldn't order his soup again. It tasted a bit more like broth than Italian Wedding soup. Our salads came, I had the beet salad and my husband had the house salad....and once again portions were huge and delicious. I really loved the crispy & baked kale that was on top of my beet salad. Everything tasted fresh and made to order for sure.....Woot, Woot.

Onto the main meal....well my first option was the cornish hen and to my huge surprise and disappointment the waitress advised us that they ran out of it............Whaaaat it was only 7:00pm that we were having dinner how could they run out of stuff already......Really, Really....I didn't believe that for a second....they must have been saving it for the customers that were paying full price....because that cornish hen can be expensive you know....LOL 

Anyways we both ordered the Korean Braised Beef ribs.....well what do you know, the ribs were boneless and I have to say the meat was very succulent and tender, it literally melted in your mouth.

Whatever method of cooking they use for those ribs they should carry on using it. The ribs came with squash and their version of wild rice and Kimchee....well, well it was definitely delicious and the Kimchee was spicy and delicious just like the one you would find in a Korean Restaurant however better.

And on to the dessert...............well that's where we were both disappointed it was some sort of a squash cake that was trying too hard to compete with the carrot cake...Took one bite and had to push it away.....Yuck, Yuck No thanks.....

Overall everything was great, would we go back there without some sort of a Wag Jag, Groupon or voucher................uh let me think about that for a second and the answer would be NO. It's great food and all however it's just waaaaaaaaaaayyyyy too expensive for what the restaurant is promoting.

Shouldn't local food be cheaper considering that it hasn't traveled the distance.....well that's my two sense on that."}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance was nice.   The bread that was served upon ordering was very good.  I ordered the burger and my friend ordered the steak salad. The burger was quite delicious and something I would definitely order again.  The fries were good, perhaps a little crispier would've improved them but that's just a matter of taste.  My friend had the composed steak salad.  The serving size seemed substantial enough and while she liked it, I get the sense she would have given it a four-star rating (food only).  Overall, a nice place, decent food and good service."}
{"text":"Good food! A must try.. All the food taste really fresh and has loads of flavour. The staff are super friendly!! Best part is supporting the local market!!"}
{"text":"Went to Earth Bloor West for Winterlicious dinner 2012.  Food was acceptable.  Soup was a basic broth, mains were excuted nicely and dessert was amazing.  What troubled us was the atrocious service.  We were a group of six young women, branded as \"Winterlicious Cheapskates\" from the beginning.  Our waitress clearly didn't want to serve us or bother checking on us.  She was rude and unapologetic. I will not go out of my way across the city for that experience again."}
{"text":"no wonder this place closed. it was all looks and no substance.  the food was ridiculously expensive in miniature portions."}
{"text":"bland, overpriced, did not list all ingredients (including major allergens) in descriptions on the menu.

we had the pig bits appetizer, pickerel main and sweetbreads main. was expecting a better meal at that price point."}
{"text":"I have been here twice before - Dinner and New Years Eve 2011.  This location has some sort of jinx.  My Place, owned by former ACC chef Brad Long. didn't last very long.  Before that, it sat empty for years after The Fan sports bar had been here for many years.  I had been to My Place twice before and it didn't have any identity.  earth does have an identity.

Unfortunately this time around, with the construction of the condo next door Bloor between Jane and Kingsway is a mess. The public parking is down the hill at the next block behind the restaurant.  It would deter anyone from visiting here.  Construction usually kills businesses if they don't have a contingency plan.  I would hope they do stay around.  

So after not wanting to wait at Good Fork, we decided to take a walk to earth.  There were plenty of choices on the  brunch menu.  We decided to order the Pork Benny and the Swine & Dine (pork six ways).  There is a lot of meat on the latter dish.  I'm sure they could have charged at least $20 for this dish.  But it was only $14 for both. We both left full.  

The decor is really nice and would be a shame if they left the neighbourhood.  It's definitely a place I would suggest to visit.  It's close to the Jane subway Station.  If you plan to drive, park at the lot just east of the station, if you aren't the lucky ones to find on-street parking.  It is only a few 2 1/2 blocks from here.

The clientele is meant to be a little more upscale, especially since their flagship restaurant is in Rosedale.  The opportunity is there to change the menu slightly to cater to many patrons.  Who knows what will happen in the near future."}
{"text":"Most of the three stars in my review go to the decor and service, but not to the food. The restaurant is truly beautiful-- spacious, but not so much that it doesn't have a certain coziness to it. 

My boyfriend and I had a Groupon, which we rarely purchase, but wanted to try this place. Service was great, and I was impressed that they had a bottle of the Kendall Jackson Chardonnay that we had enjoyed a few months earlier in Florida. The food left me sort of cold, though. 

We began with the Crispy Curds and Chipotle Ketchup.They were tasty but something about them seemed a little diner-ish and ghetto. I guess after seeing the decor, I expected the food to be presented in the same manner.

The mussels were nice and plump, but mussels are pretty simple to begin with and cooking them that way isn't rocket science.

I think what got to me the most was the special that I ordered. I had the Dover sole with Lobster sauce. The sole was poached, which led it to all fall apart. Sole, being such a delicate fish in flavour and texture begs for a bit more pan seasoning or even a browning to keep it intact for presentation. It was okay, but I make better sole at home in a little brown butter with capers.

My boyfriend had the duck and it was okay as well. But nothing really jumped out at us as being especially wonderful. We had a nice time and I might even go back if I had a large group of people who weren't too food savvy but impressed by nice decor. In general, though this place is not as fit for foodies as it claims.

Underwhelmed--- someone else used that word and it's a good description. I'm sure that it's been a word since 1992 when Sloan sang about it."}
{"text":"The food is the stand out here. Always amazing flavours, inspired combinations, and beautiful plating. I love that the menu changes based on seasonally-available ingredients. The service is professional and efficient. Atmosphere is nice and great for a date."}
{"text":"Went to Earth for brunch recently with a bunch of friends.  Almost all the guys ordered the Swine Six Ways. It was kinda gross but kinda awesome at the same time.  

The space here is HUGE. Definitely not what you would expect in Bloor West.  It's beautifully decorated, clean, black, silver.. again, not at all what I was expecting.

The menu is lovely, not too crazy with options. They have a skillet panckake and smoked trout... great brunch options for everyone.

The service was fantastic, the prices were great and I will definitely be back to try other options for not only brunch but for dinner as well!"}
{"text":"I went there for a birthday on Saturday.  The decor was very nice.  The service was good and the food was great, although we just shared a few appetizers.  The fish taco bowl things were fantastic and the pizzas were nice."}
{"text":"Very nice layout and vibe, not too loud.  

The appetizers were better then the main.  The elk and morel mushroom pasta sounded  amazing but I was thoroughly disappointed.  There was no love to that dish, it was flavourless, did not taste any Morels at all, and the whole dish was brown with no colour whatsoever.  There were 3 others dining with me and there was only 2 mains that looked appetizing. 

Earth failed at executing their cuisine in a big way;  The prices are too high for the value of the mains."}
{"text":"I've been on a bit of a groupon kick lately, so when I saw the groupon for a 4 course meal for 4 people for $75, I jumped on it, since it is quite a good value!

earth has two floors available and is very spacious (seems like the type of place that would be really good if you're booking somewhere with a fairly large group.) the decor is nice & trendy.

We went around 6:45pm on a Saturday, and while it was steady it definitely was not packed, and we felt that service was a bit absent and could have been more attentive,  but the servers were very friendly & knowledgable.

We started off with the charcuterie board, meant to be the shared first course for all four people (I feel that for four people it was a bit small.) It came with your general array of pates, meats, and cheese. We only had four extremeeely small pieces of brie on the cheese front, and we felt that the potions could have been a bit bigger on that end, or at least a bit more varied. It also came with falafel balls - which were a nice unique addition to the board!

I had the cauliflower soup garnished with pancetta for my main - it was super flavourful and delicious - also not too heavy as to weigh me down for the rest of my meals. 3/4 of my party had the soup and it was gone extremely fast - a hit for everyone that had it. My boyfriend had the pork croquettes and described them as \"deep fried meat paste\" - the table all tried it and I don't really think anyone were fans of this dish. 

I had the striploin for my main - it wasn't bad, though I had asked for it med-rare and it came much closer to the medium side - other than that I don't really have complaints about it, but it did not wow me in any way. I wasn't a fan of the creamy polenta that came with it - reminded me of eating some flavourless paste (second paste reference of the night - not always a good sign!) - I've had much better polenta elsewhere.

Let me tell you though, my boyfriend had the pork two ways, and it came with THE. MOST. DELICIOUS. cheesy scalloped potatoes I have ever eaten. I may or may not have stolen the majority of them :). There's the wow factor I was looking for!

I finished my 4 course meal with the milk chocolate custard - it was yummy, but again, sort of lacking anything special.

Overall, some hits and some misses, though as a few other reviews have described, we were a bit underwhelmed. I may try this place out for the yummy looking brunch, but I don't see myself coming back for a dinner service, especially sans groupon. I will however be thinking about those incredible cheesy scalloped potatoes for a while - mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Appetizers were better than mains - I had the soup and salad which were amazing, which made me expect a ton for my beef tenderloin main. The beef was very dry, chewy, and had a weird grayish colour to it. The dessert (panna cotta) also left much to be desired. Would say the same for my partner's main which was a portuguese chicken entree (dry and left much to be desired) and dessert (some kind of torte, also dry). This is unfortunate as the ambiance was quite nice and I loved it when it was Brad Long's My Place Pub. The waiter and bus boy were super socially awkward - made us seem uncomfortable - you'll know what I mean if you get them. Prices were steep for the quality of food. I would just eat a bunch of appetizers if you end up having to go to this place."}
{"text":"Fine food but slow service. Had Sat brunch here and the waitress seemed to have been fired after taking our orders as she was never seen again. Coffees came 10min after ordering and worst was having to ask for the bill thrice."}
{"text":"my wife received a gift card for earth from her boss for taking care of her dog while she was out of town, so we decided to check it out on a quiet thursday evening. we were pretty pumped to sit out on the upstairs patio but were woefully informed that it wasn't open yet, so we trudged begrudgingly to our indoor table. service was tremendously helpful: our waiter clearly knew his shit, in stark contrast to many of the bussers who wandered around confused like they were lost in a mall. the food was actually pretty good, however, given the prices, i expected to be taken aback & was merely satisfied. for 22 dollars, chicken should have more than 3-4 bites of meat on it. at 14-15 dollars, i'd say it's par for the course, but at over 20 you need to give me something to savor.

swansea & bloor-west village have enough cafes, restaurants, & the like that overpaying for food that doesn't knock you out doesn't seem sensible. would i come back if someone offered to take me? sure. would i choose it among the dozens of other places in the area were it up to me? probably not."}
{"text":"Now closed."}
{"text":"I am really struggling between giving this place a 2 or 3 stars... so consider this a 2.5.
First off the ambiance for this place is quite nice and I was surprised how well they transformed the space into a chic, dark and maybe even romantic environment. This location was used to be a scuzzy bar called \"The Fan\" which I used to consider my stomping grounds in my early 20's.

Our waitress was a very nice but in a sort of fake kind of way (not that I am holding that against her). She seemed to be working very hard for her tip which she earned for her attentiveness.

The menu was sort of a bit pretentious and to be honest I was bullied into the wellington county rib eye burger because I had no interest in the remainder of my options. Truth be told I made the right choice. My burger was incredible but decidedly over priced at $18. 

The rest of my table had mixed reviews ranging from pretty good to the worse meal they've ever paid for. In the end, for the average price point I expected a more consistent feeling across the table. Some meals looked great and some looked sad (the elk). 

Bottom line is if I was footing the bill, I would never bring someone here but if I was being treated to a meal I wouldn't necessarily drag my feet."}
{"text":"I was pleased to hear a local sourced ingredients restaurant opened up in this Bloor west area. 

I want to start off by saying the space is modern and spacious but not intimate or enjoyable, it's just there and blah. after the food the good feelings died. Their heirloom tomato salad was the highlight of the night for me because the Country \"mixed\" plate wasn't all that good. The lobster was ok but the flavors clashed. This feeling extended throughout the rest of the meal, which was below expectations and needed something more. 

The duck was good ( order that if you want something that doesn't disappoint). 

The dessert was also not amazing. 

The meal came to $125 for two with tip. Food but no alcohol. For this amount I want the food to be better, and Earth just did not deliver. 

Perhaps another time but this is unlikely as Toronto has better options and I cannot support a restaurant so fancy and mediocre. Luckily for them, this review won't be read by 70% of the people that frequent Earth."}
