{"text":"The food was exceptional. I had the omelette with feta, spinach, shallots, and tomato which came with potatoes, fruit, toast, and coffee. My husband had the Mexican burrito which came with potatoes and fruit. The service was very good - we went on a Tuesday around 11am and there was no wait.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for brunch!"}
{"text":"This was one of, if not the best, eggs benedict I've ever had. I travel a lot for my company and always treat myself to eggs benny. The version I got here was called the Billy Goat which had goat cheese, spinach, capers, and salmon. It was delicious. The homefries were great as well in terms of taste and crispiness, albeit a little salty. The eggs also came with a nice plate of fresh fruit.

The staff was friendly and courteous even though my French is atrocious, haha. They came over several times refilling coffee and water.

The booth I sat in was huge and comfy with a great view of both the televisions inside and the street outside. What a nice place to eat breakfast while traveling."}
{"text":"Had a very disappointing experience.
Took multiple requests after 40min to get food and drink ordered
Entire table was served and one persons food did not arrive until another 45 min later only once we flagged the Manager for help. 
The bills (2) needs to be redone 3x because Server kept getting mixed up. 
Would not recommend or come again"}
{"text":"Huge portions! Eggs benedict was delicious. It was accompanied by house fries and fresh fruit. Since the place was crowded it was quite noisy. Service was fast and attentive despite the large number of guests. There was a long line up when we arrived (10-15 min wait) but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Had salmon Benedict which was pretty tasty and the side potatoes were great.  The real surprise was was the fruit bowl that came with breakfast - best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I really have no idea what Sharif from Washington, DC is talking about. I have never (and I mean never) experienced anything close to what his experience was like at Universel. In fact, I love this restaurant for breakfast. And lets not kid ourselves folks this is the main attraction: breakfast/brunch. The lunch menu is good but the star of the show--all Montrealais who frequent this place already know this--is breakfast. Its so CHEAP and SO GOOD. I usually get the two eggs with bacon order which comes with hash browns (chunky seasoned potatoes) with fresh fruit and toast (four pieces) and free coffee. I believe its $5.95 ... uh, yea. CHEAP, let me emphasize that. Unlimited coffee refills too. I have also had the eggs benedict which are also super fantastic. They are a little pricer but worth it: huge serving, unreal Hollandaise sauce, and many different options (smoked salmon, asparagus, etc.) A lot of people opt for the eggs benny. And the service is fast. I've never waited more than 10 minutes to get my food, and really it shouldn't take much longer than that for  bacon an eggs. But do be patient because this place gets hopping on the weekends. 

This my go to place when I'm hungover from a night out on the town in Montreal. Like any good Canadian I go to soak up the alcohol with some greasy goodness. The staff know the routine on Saturday mornings and are quick to offer you coffee, which is much appreciated. If you can: opt for a banquette seat which are comfy for those in your group who can sang one of the booth seats (love those!). There is sometimes a wait--not usually more than 5 minutes--but there is a nearly year-round heated (and they really mean heated) patio. Its nice to sit outside in the summer, and in the fall you really are not effected by the chill. 

So if you're a tourist: this is the go-to place to nurse that hang-over or if you're from Montreal make use of this little gem to get all the bacon and eggs you could ever want. Also the decor is much, much better than your typical diner. They modernized rather recently and the design is ultra-chic :) Popular with McGill students too. Check it out."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of downtown, Universel is a great place for quality casual dining. I came for dinner, and was quickly seated. The decor is nice, and the restaurant kept very clean. A waitress came to me in a timely fashion, and I ordered the seafood fettuccine. My Caesar Salad came minutes after I had made my order. The salad was nice. Croutons were homemade and not too much dressing (as experienced in other places). Minutes after I had finished my salad, my pasta came out piping hot. Sauce was delicious (slightly messy, but that was my fault), and there was ample amounts of seafood (includes shrimp, scallops, clams, and mussels). Pasta was slightly overcooked, but no huge complaints. The price is fair for what I got. Overall, good service, good food, fair price. A great place to hangout after work in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, cool restaurant space, and huge splittable portions make this a perfect spot to bring a friend for breakfast/brunch. The menu is quite extensive, so it takes a while to pick something, but our meals have always been nicely crafted with delicious flavors. The filter coffee is also of good quality so no sugar or cream is necessary. We'll be back here on our future visits to Montreal."}
{"text":"Lovely environment and food selections. We were offered lunch or brunch based on our choice. We sat outside. Service was quick. We were offerred from breakfast and lunch menu. The tomato pesto cheese sandwich was good. I'm not sure what boroncini cheese is but...the breakfast burrito was nice. The beans were a bit sweet but it came with home fries and fruit. We also had the souvlaki wrap which had excess tsasiki but overall was good. Service was prompt and friendly and the outside deck on street side was pleasant   Worth another visit."}
{"text":"amazing food! you have the brunch menu even for lunch and afternoon tea!"}
{"text":"Rare sont les restos de Déjeuner avec un tel service, un tel prix, et un tel menu et ce SANS le fameux decor avec des foutu coq partout. Hey! Par défault ils vous servent du VRAI sirop d'érable! LÀ tu parles!"}
{"text":"Food is expensive but ok.  Don't even think about getting a seat on the terrace after 10am. Inside is humid,  overcrowded and unbearably noisy. Literally could not have a conversation with my wife sitting across the table from me. Will not come back again when it's crowded."}
{"text":"Ce brunch dont vous avez tant besoin après une soirée fatiguante, il existe !! Les plats sont généreux, pour des prix raisonables.
L'endroit est propre, bien placé, agréable. Pensez a reserver ! L'attente peut être longue et douloureuse (a l'extérieur).
Attention, près des fenêtres, il fait froid. Bien que les plats vs réchauffent vite, si vous êtes frileux, demander une autre place."}
{"text":"I have only been to the location on Peel, but I' assuming that they are pretty much the same. The menu is extensive and the food is amazing. Well-priced for what you get (which is a lot!) and the service is pretty good for a Montreal restaurant. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great place for Breakfast BUT FYI They DON'T have any gluten free breads or muffins to go with your eggs!! For some reason it came up on my search for gluten free breakfast and for me breakfast is not complete without bread!!!!
 I came here especially for eggs with gluten free bread or muffin but found out they don't have any gluten free bread!! I half enjoyed my omelette without gluten free bread but the fruit bowl was amazing. Service and staff are great otherwise and place is clean and super efficient!! One star down due to lack of gluten free bread option :("}
{"text":"The food is really good, portions are generous and really not that expensive! You can eat for 25$ or 60$ depending on your budget!"}
{"text":"This place is sort of like an upscale fine dining establishment that also serves standard regular run of the mill breakfast dishes. The execution is well done and the array of choices is very fun. This juxtaposition of contrasting styles and elements works surprisingly well for me. As a big dumb Murican, I felt the need to try the classic Poutine. While I thought the flavors were great, the dish overall just wasn't working for me personally. Something about soggy fries just doesn't sit will with me. The reason I gave this place 5 stars was because the Chicken Wrap that Jess got was the best I have ever eaten. My cappuccino was also perfect! Go Canada!"}
{"text":"Had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and was pleasantly surprised how the cheese complemented the hollandaise sauce perfectly. The roasted potatoes were wonderful and it was simply delightful to have them at the side. The place offers standard free flow coffee so request it if you would like to have more. They also serve soy milk together with the coffee for an additional of $1 for those who can't take dairy. Overall, a classy place worth a visit!"}
{"text":"For breakfast in Montreal, Universel wins. These people take pride in their work and it shows. With most breakfast dishes comes fresh cut fruit on a skewer. Someone spends their morning carving the fruit with a smile. Extrapolate that attention to detail to the rest of your dining experience, and you've got Universel.

If St. Laurent has the disease, Universel's got the cure. The portions are heaping but lack the grease common to many hangover-curing breakfast joints. We usually get some combination of eggs benedict or omelets. The gf and I are particularly fond of the universel, an omelet with every breakfast meat under the sun, and the billy goat, eggs benedict with smoked salmon, goat cheese, greens, etc. The already large portions are accompanied by the aforementioned fruit skewer and a heaping pile of quartered potatoes. Also check out their milk shakes and smoothies, though they are meals unto themselves."}
{"text":"Nice decor, good service but terrible food. Had to send slouvaki sandwitch back. It came out almost immediately after ordering. Clearly the chicken had been cooked ahead of time and reheated. Tough and dry. The waiter was very helpful and brought a substitute, which was just okay, as were the poutine and mussels"}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs brunch que j'ai eu l'occasion de prendre ici à Montréal (avec Dame tartine et le passé composé) Personnel accueillant, assiette copieuse , prix raisonnable(pour la quantité). Un peu d'attente le dimanche mais ça vaut la peine d'attendre."}
{"text":"simple nice place for a perfect lazy brunch, lots of choice and their drinks are also very well made, recommend it to all those who cannot wake up early in the morning and wants to take a brunch at 12 haha"}
{"text":"Ahhh! I love it! The food I very good! Nice outdoor terasse. 
My favorite waiter is Mathieu
I love my happy Friday at Universal !"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with good service but the food is overpriced and there's not a lot of flavor. Not the best brunch spot."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. Portions are sizeable and leave you contently full. The smoothies are also delicious.

We were a party of 8 that showed up on a Sunday without a reservation. At first, there was hesitance about whether they would be able to seat is anytime soon but somehow they managed to give us conjoined tables after only a wait of 5 minutes. It was busy but all of our food came within 20 minutes after we ordered."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome!! Service is really good, the food even better, whether it be breakfast or dinner!

I go there sometime with my gf for breakfast, they're usually packed, but still manage to get a seat within 5min if we have to wait. Their salmon omelet with cheese is amazing, its my favourite there. And for dinner I love their steaks and chicken. The prices are fair, and I usually go there at least once a month, always a pleasant experience, nite or day!"}
{"text":"Breakfast poutine. Enough said.  Great little spot for breakfast and brunch. All the dishes we had were excellent, servers were terrific."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I have ever had in Montreal. Even thou the place was packed my boyfriend and me did not had to wait long for a table. We did not wait long for the food. Staff was excellent."}
{"text":"Did bfast here and it was very good.  Staff was friendly and attentive. Crepes were delicious.   Will go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast/brunch restaurant in heart of Montreal. Lots of innovative breakfast choices. Great friendly and timely service. Highly recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"Must try: In the eggs section, the crepe with chocolate, strawberry shortcake, and bananas
IT IS AMAZING!!!
Their menu is an all day thing... So u can have the same thing for different meals if u really like it
WE ENJOYED IT SO MUCH WE WENT THERE TWICE IN THREE DAYS!!!
Tip: if u get a crepe with chocolate get the chocolate in the side because they put a LOT on
Also the chocolate is really Nutella"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Came here twice on our long weekend in Montreal.  Servings are enormous, so the second time I just got two sides and was still sufficiently stuffed.  The crepes are on the thick side, but still delicious; waffles are light and fluffy; home fries are nicely seasoned and the hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict was fantastic.  Was only disappointed in the hot chocolate- it was watery even though it looked super chocolately."}
{"text":"Smoked salmon Benedict and a side of strawberry chocolate hazelnut crepe. Delicious Chamomile tisane. For my 3 year old A kids pancake and chocolate milk. Fabulous meal and lovely service. They even let me park my big stroller next to the table so I didn't wake my sleeping 5 month old."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast/brunch. The lunch items looked appetizing as well. 

Nice atmosphere inside.

Excellent waffles, crepes and omelette's. Good home fries too and large portions. Highly recommended, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant does exactly what it's meant to do. Feed you a monster breakfast when the craving arises... Or cure a hangover.

I had the universel breakfast with three meats and bananas on my french toast. The breakfast was exactly what I needed to hit the spot. The ham was very tasty considering it is usually overshadowed by it's other two breakfast meat counterparts. The bacon and sausage was great, but really, how can anyone screw those up? Eggs were yolky and ready to be soaked up by my toast. The only thing that fell short was the french toast. It didn't have a great texture and it just seemed like more of a filler than a defining part of the meal. My girlfriend had the eggs benedict with sautéed mushrooms and goat cheese. She said it was very tasty, but as eggs benedict lovers, we've had better. A cool thing they do is offer a pitcher of orange juice for large groups. Seems very simple, but I haven't seen to many places do this.

The place is really crowded. You really feel like your sitting with the people next to you. This doesn't seen to matter since everyone is wrapped up in their own world; talking about whatever happened the night before. Place has a nice modern look to it and offers seating on their outside terrace which is nice in the summer months.

Staff was very nice and service was very quick considering how many people there were. I will definety come back to this place in the future to satisfy my hungry man urges!"}
{"text":"Walked in the doors, there was a line up (as expected). But what was unexpected, was that we were seated almost immediately. 

Seating is cozy yet comfortable. You're quite close to your neighbours however, the atmosphere makes the closeness almost forgotten. Table was adorned with all the necessities for a perfect coffee and all the condiments for a perfectly seasoned meal. 

The ambiance is quite trendy here. Plastic chandeliers adorn the ceiling, textured green wall paper lines the walls and green velvet covers the booth seating. It's a very 'hip' place to walk into. 

It took a little longer than average to be greeted by our server, however it did not bother me. It's a busy place but seems very well managed. The server was very nice and seemed genuinely interested in our morning. Our order was taken promptly, our coffees served and our water glasses refilled. 

The meal came VERY quickly! I'm talking less than 7 minutes quickly. But! Nothing about my plate looked rushed. The meal (combination eggs benedict) was well prepared: eggs benedict cooked perfectly to my liking, potatoes browned to perfection and a fruit bowl so appealing I had to eat it first! 

My coffee was refilled over breakfast, my water refilled multiple times and the server did pay attention to our needs. Overall, this was a wonderful experience... Now, if you'll excuse me... I'm going to get back to my coffee :)"}
{"text":"This place is the best, I spent 10 days in Montreal and stayed at the Omni which is literally right next door and I came here everyday for at least one meal, was never once disappointed the food is amazing and the staff are really friendly. I went to a few other places around downtown Montreal and this was definitely the best!"}
{"text":"Wow. After nearly 300 good reviews you know you can't go wrong, and we weren't disappointed. 
We went fairly early on Grand Prix weekend Sunday, and all had a great meal at a very reasonable price. Especially given the location right downtown. 

We can happily recommend this place to anyone wanting a good, hearty breakfast/brunch that's nicely presented and prepared."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast/brunch on a weekday here. The food's good and a little inventive - the omelettes and eggs benedicts are interesting, and they have bagels and crepes, waffles, and French toast. I'd give it 4 stars for food. The service I got, though, was ruthlessly and unwelcomingly efficient - the hostess nearly ran into me as she scurried to seat someone else, the waitress initially told me she was too busy to tell me the wifi password, I got the check before being asked if I wanted anything else, and my waitress lurked uncomfortably over my shoulder as I used the credit card machine. 

There's construction outside, so the porch is noisy for now, but it's loud inside as well. If you're looking to talk to friends (and hear them), or linger while you finish drinking your coffee, based on my experience, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Good service, incredibly large portions.  They have several early bird specials from 7-9am of basic breakfasts for under $7 including coffee/tea.  I had the two eggs and crepe/waffle/french toast special, with crepes. It was around twelve dollars and I didn't realize that with that I would be getting a basket of toast, way too many potatoes and a giant crepe stuffed with banana, strawberry and chocolate sauce. 

Everything was edible; the crepe was quite good, but the potatoes arrived already a bit cool and were definitely the weak link to the whole thing.  My friend called them 'abysmal' but I wouldn't go too far.  

All in all a great early morning breakfast option."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to grab a casual dinner, good food for a good price with very good service. I had the seafood risotto and my wife had a burger, both our dinners were great and there was a wine special on that was two for one, you can't beat that! The manager helped seat us and he was awesome!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch.  Great crepes and awesome ice tea!  The service was prompt and everyone seemed to work together to help get us our order quickly."}
{"text":"The food here was really good and a decent value considering what you got. I enjoyed a delicious waffle and my partner said his salmon was really good. The place was packed when we arrived and the seating is a bit cramped, but we didn't need to wait long for a table which was great."}
{"text":"We're staying next store at the Omni and have been here twice already. First time was for breakfast and it was delicious! Lots of healthy choices and food was fantastic. We went back again for dessert and it did not disappoint. I highly recommend the apple pie- delicious! The variety of fresh and delicious food makes it an obvious and easy choice for any meal! YUMM."}
{"text":"My wife got sick from the salmon tartar! We have ate at this restaurant several times over the last couple of years. Usually, everything is great and the restaurant is kid friendly (which is a plus for us and our two young kids). My wife unfortunately got sick soon after eating the salmon tartar. When mentioned to the waitress, the manager spoke with us and said that he had personally verified all of the salmon and there was no problem? He then offered my wife a ginger tea to help with the nausea. Otherwise the atmosphere is nice and a great location downtown."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! A few dollars more than other places but the portions are large and very tasty.

--
EDIT
My original review above will stand. I really liked this place. Then I went back the next morning and sat at the bar. A roach crawled out from some menus and I promptly pointed it out to a waiter who smashed it. He called the head guy in charge who picked it up with a napkin and that's it. No one cleaned the bar top where the roach was crawling. Yes this place was busy at the time, but if they don't clean up in view of where a customer saw a roach, imagine what they do back in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere 
Very good service 
They have both breakfast and lunch menus

I prefer the breakfast menu 
The egg Benedict selection is very good 
I had the Billy goat 

The waffles are also nice 
The universal is very good"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  I had the smoked salmon with bagels and the mushroom & goat cheese egg benedict.  Best meal I had while visiting Montreal. Highly recommend this place for breakfast or brunch.  It's a busy place so make reservations or expect a wait to be seated."}
{"text":"Weekend brunch favourite in the neighbourhood. Great atmosphere, great food, and (almost always) great staff. Lots of options, generous portions. Really love the crowd here. 

The benedicts are usually my favourite (the Billy Goat and the Universel in particular). Omlettes and crepes are also solid bets. Actually, pretty  much everything is a solid bet. Given the volume of food, it is often nice to order one salty item off the menu (i.e. omlette)  and one sweet thing (i.e. crepe) and split them half-half with a friend to get a good mix of both flavours. 

Note: some items come with a free coffee, and some don't, which can be confusing."}
{"text":"As the saying goes, if you're not sure where to go, go to a place that looks like it is packed with locals and it's bound to be good. This once again turned out to be true a we stumbled upon Universel. I enjoyed the Mexican breakfast a lot. I really liked the fresh fruit they served with it. The wife had a simple omelette with cheese and a crêpe. Nothing fancy, but very well flavoured none the less. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I'd give it 4.5 because the service is great,  food seems consistent, good value. There's a patio at the one near the Omni at Peel and Sherbrooke, the one on St Catherine's has windows open to the street. After eating there twice now we have decided to split the large breakfasts - so much food!  J'adotr le fruit frais. I haven't eaten this much fruit since, well...never.  Oh!  And big jugs o' Maple Syrup. My only wish is that the bacon was a little higher quality but that's nitpicking."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a getaway weekend and felt like we were brunching with the locals.  It was busy, crowded and delicious.  We ended up taking curling with the next table over and enjoyed taking in the hues and costumes of the Montrealers the flock to this popular local favorite."}
{"text":"We went here for New Year's Breakfast today and got the following items:

-Cafe Au Lait (bowl)
-L'Univers Fruit Juice
-Apple, Bacon, and Cheddar Crepe
-Ham and Swiss Crepe

Both crepes were pretty tasty, although I personally liked the apple/bacon/cheddar one better.  However, my bf liked the ham/swiss crepe better.  I thought both crepes were a little bland and needed a little more oomf in flavor.  For example, the ham wasn't very salty and there wasn't much bacon to add saltiness. Having said that, I really liked that the crepes themselves were thick yet fluffy.

As for the drinks, the juice was a bit sour for my taste but I still enjoyed it and emptied my glass.  I'm not really a coffee person but the bf seemed impressed by the cafe au lait.

Extra props to them for being open on New Years though!!"}
{"text":"Avoid this restaurant.

We went for dinner (haven't tried breakfast) with friends last night and the service, although polite, was slow and made mistakes (wrong dishes brought out) draught beer wasn't working, happy hour only included the cheapest/worst drinks, two plates of moules/mussels did not smell (or really even taste) fresh, and the key ingredients in my dish (garlic and cognac) were no where to be tasted, suggesting either cheap ingredients or a kitchen that skimps. The, I believe \"homemade\", fries that came with my mussels smacked of frozen pre-cut potatoes, although the frying oil seemed to be fresh.

A friend's shrimp provencale smelled odd and were tough, yet she said they were better than another friend's fried calamari that she had tasted. The sangria was watery, and to boot, the bill came out to over $30 per person (which would have been acceptable had the food, drinks, and service been much better than they were).

We all left wondering how this place is still open, and we don't plan on returning. There are much better places to eat in the area, and across Montreal in general.

As others have mentioned in their reviews, the location is nice and the decor appealing. The restaurant is clean and so are the bathrooms."}
{"text":"I took the Universel Eggs Benedict. That was an awesome amount of food (especially for the price) and service was pretty good. Another plus is that the fruits were really fresh, and they give you a lot of it.

On the downside, I found that I didn't like the mix of bagel with the eggs. I probably would have liked the dish more with english muffins. Also, the bacon strips were a little bit overcooked on my dish."}
{"text":"Price - Quality is very good. Eggs and home made potatoes are great. Nice friendly service, even if you are by your own."}
{"text":"This place was a block away from our hotel and had decent reviews so we decided to give it a try. Stopped in around 9:30 AM and the place was already starting to fill up. We sat outside and ordered the Benedict Universal and an egg sandwich with ham and cheese. The portions were HUGE so come hungry. Mains were accompanied by crispy chuncks of potatoes and lots of fresh fruit. Service was good, waitress nice. My only complaint is that the dishes were not served hot and the cheese on both of our dishes were not melted at all."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast with maple syrup.  I had the eggs with crepes and it was almost like having two breakfasts- a regular breakfast with eggs, toast and home fries and then having dessert breakfast.  The selection was so varied that I had trouble choosing.  There were several of us and we also ordered eggs benedict and the breakfast poutine.  The poutine was extremely rich.  Everything was delicious!  The staff was friendly and, as it was Halloween, everyone had a costume, even early in the morning.   If I return, I think that I would order either a waffle with fruit or get the eggs with a simple crepe and just pour the sirop d'erable and pretend that I was at a cabane a sucre."}
{"text":"This place was so good, that my girlfriend and I returned 3 times on our 9 days in Montreal (every time for brunch). The eggs Benedict was great, but the crepes and the waffles that came with the \"universal\" breakfast were fantastic. Highly recommend for brunch."}
{"text":"We were visiting Montreal for two days. Love the place and the food. The best brunch menu I have ever seen. They have everything you can imagine. It was so delicious. I loved it so much that we ate breakfast- brunch twice during our 2 day trip. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"First brunch@Universel Déjeuners et Grillades. Two Benedict with mushroom and potato. Perfect choice at this monument. Delicious food with big portion. Fast and excellent service."}
{"text":"Great price/quality ratio. Portions are good. A little slow maybe due to freshness. Recommend it 100%."}
{"text":"We found this place via Yelp's nearby search. The restaurant looks very nice and it was quite packed for brunch. Since we were two, we were seated fairly quickly. Service and food were excellent. We would go back if in the area again."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped at Universel for breakfast one morning before venturing around Montreal. 

The atmosphere is a bit cheesy, but the food and drinks were both relatively good, and the service was quick and friendly. While it was a bit pricey, I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a heavier, more filling and \"American\" breakfast option."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic brunch on Sunday! We're in town and staying around the corner at the Omni. We were seated right away even though it was very busy. The server was super attentive and the food came fast and hot. 

I got the Eggs Benedict with Salmon and they were great! My husband got the Eggs Florentine he loved them. The eggs were a little on the hard side not runny but they were still tasty so If you like them more runny then just be sure to specify. The portions are big we couldn't finish our whole plate. They all came with fruit and potatoes. 

All in all great meal!"}
{"text":"These guys were great for a Sunday brunch. $5.50 for scrambled eggs on toast! Some hash browns, melon and orange on the side, and sautéed muchrooms for a fraction more. What a deal! Great place to have a long breakfast... Outside tables less noisy. Staff great, bottomless American coffee too, or latte's etc which were fine"}
{"text":"This was by far the best restaurant I have been to in Montreal on my 10 day stay.

The prices may put you off at first, but you get what you pay for.
I've had steak, pasta, chicken and a salad dish and all were fantastic. The salad was the only dish I was able to finish.
Drink prices are reasonable, and service is very quick and efficient.
It's also a plus that the staff are all fluent in English and French.

I highly recommend coming to Universal, unfortunately I didn't get to sample the breakfast menu, but if it is anything like the dinner menu it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Good place for a downtown brunch.  May be crowded at times, but then again so is every place in downtown Montreal when it's nice out"}
{"text":"Another great recommendation by our hotel's concierge. Went here for Sunday brunch. It looked as though many people were waiting for tables but we were fortunately seated at a table for 2 within 5 minutes. The service was great. The omelettes were huge. The meal was really delicious and filling."}
{"text":"Went at about noon on a weekday, with a baby and a stroller, and they were very accommodating and welcoming.  They even gave me a 4-person table so that I'd have lots of room, even though I was the only paying customer at the table, and the restaurant was full and busy.

The staff were friendly.  My fruit crepe with custard hit the spot.  

My only pet peeve: I ordered a tea, and they brought me a cup of hot water, with a tea bag on the side.  Restaurants need to know: the tea just doesn't brew when you have to put the bag in the tea.  It is a way better cup of tea if you pour the water on the bag.  So either bring it pre-poured, or bring the water in a little teapot, so that it can be poured over the bag into the mug."}
{"text":"We started off with a pitcher of mimosas, Bloody Mary n some Madagascar mussels. Those mussels were off the chain. Then came the eggs Benny w/bacon, waffles, salmon. My god those eggs were perfect n the hollandaise was seasoned to perfection. Waffles were so airy n the maple syrup was pure. Crepes were tasty as well but a tad too thick. All in all, the meal was fantastic and would be back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"The service was LOOOOOONG! 

The restaurant was very busy i'll agree, but seriously over 45 minutes of a wait for breakfast is a bit too much.

The breakfast was ok, service was just ok too... 

The other thing i found worst than the wait for our meals is the fact that they have only 2 bathroom stalls in such a huge restaurant!

I wouldn't recommend it but I would give them a second chance..."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it never fails to satisfy me! The breakfast is delicious and are extremely large portions. I've been here twice for dinner also, one time I had a burger which was cooked to a perfect medium and was delicious and the other time I had a salmon salad that was amazing! Not too heavy on the dressing and really large. Every time I've been I've been seated very quickly, received great service, and had a timely meal. 
This restaurant really knows what they're doing and does their job very well. The menu is very large and it seems like whatever you order you're going to receive a large amount of very delicious and filling food."}
{"text":"So I came to Universel super early in the morning, positively starving and joy awake whatsoever. In spite of that the waitress managed to figure out exactly what I mumbled for my order lol. Service was amazing, fast and on point, and she made site to double check how I wanted my eggs cooked. Got eggs Benedict with mushrooms and extra bacon (because bacon) and they were delicious. Only thing is, the food was a bit salty to my liking... If you have heart problems stay away. Thankfully my heart is still in okay condition, so I will go back there until I manage to damage it. Of recommend this place to anyone, it's definitely one of the best spots in town!"}
{"text":"Great place, nice atmosphere and the breakfast is fantastic. We have eaten here two mornings in a row."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was great, had the universal (bacon, sausage, mushroom, gruyere cheese on a bagel) for $14. Came with a bowl of Fresh fruit :) I recommend checking this place out"}
{"text":"Great choices - crepes, eggs and much more. Large portions - easily split between two people. Nice seating outdoors. Speedy service."}
{"text":"We had Saturday breakfast here.  We tried the \"Universel\"  big breakfast, the \"billy goat\" and bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches for the kids.  The food was not only great, but well presented.  The service was exceptional.  Polite, friendly, and prompt.  Our server, Amina, was the best.  She made us feel very welcome and actually gave us great tips for the rest of our visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch: service impeccable. Ambiance fabulous. Delicious crepe. Much fruit. Perfect billy goat eggs benny. Bottomless coffee. Smoothies and milkshake to fill the gaps."}
{"text":"This place was solidly mediocre at best. The food was just ok which was disappointing considering we expected 4 star food. The Benedict florentine kind of sucked because of the hollandaise sauce. Not worth trying again."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and had the universal specials - pretty much everything on a plate. We went on a Sunday at peak time so we knew we'd had to wait in line. The place was really busy but the service will still quite good nonetheless. The food was fantastic! Good value really considering the quality and the quantity!"}
{"text":"I see many people on here calling this a diner. In NYC, this place would be considered somewhat upscale for the consistent cleanliness, quality of their staff, and oh my god...the food...

If this is a \"diner,\" then please explain to this humble New Yorker how come I haven't gotten sick even once after eating here. How come the staff is well-dressed, ridiculously nice, competent, AND incredibly good-looking?! I don't think I've ever even seen that combination of qualities in a New York establishment's staff before.

This place is wonderful. If it was closer to my apartment, I would come here every single day."}
{"text":"Like its sister location, this restaurant knocks it out of the park. I only wish it was closer..."}
{"text":"The food is very delicious.  Staff and waiters and waitress are very friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My second time here and again, they did not disappoint, I love the  goton, gorton? whatevs, the pork spread, it's sooo good, for a place that's always that busy, they reall put out a good spread in a short amount of time. I will always try and eat here when I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Just came back from brunch at Universel on St. Denis with my girlfriend. We had the Universel Eggs Benedict and the Banana, Strawberry, Chocolate crepes. To drink we had one of their mixed fruit juices and cafe mocha. Both were very big portions and we didn't finish. Anyway, so the bill comes and I guess the waiter's math isn't very good because I paid and he gave me the wrong change.... twice. In the end, he came over and asked \"Est-ce que je peux t'aider?\" in a tone that suggested I'm the one who can't add. Yes, you still owe me money. Then he started to count out the money and slowly but surely, he came to realize his mistake and gave me the correct amount of change. The last comment he had was... \"Oh mais maintenant je n'ai pas assez de change\" and walked away. No \"Je m'excuse or pardon\". I guess he's never seen a $100 bill before or had to count up to 100. We still left him a decent tip but we won't be returning and won't be recommending this place to any of our friends in the future."}
{"text":"Just average, they couldn't find the waiter for our table, took 40 min to take our lunch order. I had the lunch special Grilled salmon salade... Was just ok! No need to go back..."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good service a bit spotty. Huge menu and very busy with the McGill students."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! The crepes are to die for and the home fries are cooked in some sort of delisiousness! Maple available in abundance which of course is the key to a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"In the shadow of McGill College/University is the Universal. Terrific food and busy with Students, Locals and the \"hip-ster set\" looking for a great value this IS the spot. The Universal Breakfast is a meal for all-day, but they have lunch as well.
Staff is wonderful too."}
{"text":"A gigantic hearty breakfast.  First time trying crepes and they were delicious.  Montreal is the first city I've been to with legitimate Yelp reviews, just got to filter out the temper tantrum reviews complaining about waiting for a table when it's busy and such."}
{"text":"The place looks modern and the food itself was cooked well. The drinks were better, in my opinion. I got a L'astéroïde with rum added.

The waiter was super friendly and service was great.

The only thing that bothered me about the place was the amount of fruit flies that flew around our table. Despite that, Universel Déjeuner & Grillades was a good experience."}
{"text":"I had a breakfast with my friend.  It was a wonderful Spanish omelette with coffee.  I'd love to come there again."}
{"text":"We enjoyed an excellent brunch !  The waitress was friendly and my breakfast of waffle,eggs and bacon was tasty.  Decent portions too"}
{"text":"You certainly can't beat the location on Peel and the terrace is great so I've stopped in more than once for brunch... I've been underwhelmed by the food every single time; gooey eggs, burnt grilled cheese, raw potatoes.... and unimpressive customer service."}
{"text":"I highly recommend getting the fresh squeezed orange juice!  We had the crepes with bananas and nutella.  Delicious.  This place is very busy but the service is really good.  Great place when visiting Montreal for a great brunch. We were all very happy with our breakfast!"}
{"text":"Once before I had joined a potential employer at Universel for an interview over breakfast, and decide I wanted to try breakfast here again on my own.

When I arrived at the door, I waited almost 3 to 4 minutes for someone to greet me, several servers had passed without so much as a \"Hi\" or \"Someone will be right with you\".  Finally, I was shown to a table on the front terrace.

I think it's important to note that the restaurant did not seem that busy.  I noticed 5 or 6 occupied tables on the inside, and there was only one other table on the terrace with a party of one, with plenty of staff on the floor.

Once I was seated, there was no server in sight for almost ten minutes; no one came out to offer coffee, a beverage, or to take my ordered.  I also noticed that no one was checking on the one other table either.  There was a bus boy, who completely ignored the fact there was a new table, and didn't bother notifying a server. It appears that neither did the hostess.

After waiting nearly 10 minutes, a server finally came to my table to take my order.  I order a simple 2 eggs, bacon and sausage, coffee, and OJ breakfast.  A couple of minutes later, another table of one arrived, and were seated at the table in front of me.  A different server promptly took his order.  A couple of other tables arrived in the meantime as well.

After what seemed like an a long time after ordering, I still have not been served my simple breakfast, the gentleman that arrived after me was served his breakfast, and then a table that arrived after him was also served their breakfast.  At this point, I was about to stand to find out what was going on, and the server come out with my order.  She served the breakfast, but had forgotten the toast, as here MO was not to be available; I had to ask the hostess for the toast.

As for the food, it was good, everything was cooked perfectly, and satisfied my hunger for a full breakfast, but it was not so exceptional to make it worth the wait for 2 eggs, bacon and sausage, coffee, and OJ.

When I finished eating, the server was of course prompt with the bill, the only thing that was promptly delivered the entire experience.  Then, again I was waiting to pay the bill, at this point I was impatient, and eventually had to get up and go to hostess station, where the manager had to give me the change for my bill.
 
I quickly mentioned to the manager about my experience, but he did not seem to care much, so I dropped it and left."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the service was sooooo bad I couldnt believe what I was experiencing.   It took over 1.5 hours to get our food.  The salads were ok, but the main food was less then average.  The service was horrible.  Remember its Saturday night and the restaurant from inside only had two tables full with people, including us, at the time of our order.  The outside patio was full of people, but we couldnt believe how they just forgot about us inside.  We never had our diet cokes refilled ONCE?  My mom and wife complained to the manager while I was watching my son outside, but he just shrugged them off.  Then I spoke to the manager and he said this was the average wait time to get food.  I didnt want to get into it with him, so I let it be.  I guess the other restaurants we visited in Montreal had a different version to that storyline, lol.   I was the last to get my food out of the 6 of us.  When it came it was horrible. I asked the waiteress if I could change it, but she never came back and confirmed I could get the chicken gyro.  That took another 25 minutes!! Really, 25 minutes to make a GYRO sandwich, hahaha.....They knew they were wrong b/c they gave us 10% off of the original bill.  Never will we come back here!"}
{"text":"It's a fun place to chill.

If I were the decision maker, I would have added more healthy options on the menu for breakfast - most options were heavy to handle lol

1 negative thing was that the waitresses work too hard take away dishes and clean up, sometimes they walk all around you which is a bit annoying."}
{"text":"Very nice brunch place, great staff. I loved the strawberry waffle i ordered. Heard its pretty nice for dinners too and they have excellent cocktails. Will come again in evening to try out :)"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast in a fun and lovely setting! The menu is outstanding, with creative options that are plated and presented nicely (e.g. both hashbrowns and fruit with most dishes). The only downside was that it was very crowded and loud, and our server seemed over-worked and was kind of rude."}
{"text":"A great spot for brunch!  Food was delicious. I highly recommend the French Toast combo. Service was also very good, but there seemed to be a disconnect between front of house and back of house. They miss 3 different elements of my order even though they were included on the bill. All in all, I would definitely go back and will check my order and the bill."}
{"text":"Excellent !  Le décor, la bouffe, le personnel ..."}
{"text":"I read that service was slow, on this Wednesday morning at 8:40am it was not the case, they were efficient and friendly.
Filter coffee was good, and universal fruit jive excellent."}
{"text":"Located right in the heart of downtown with covered outdoor seating is a delicious breakfast/brunch joint. Came here with the boyfriend and ordered the 1 egg with bacon and he ordered an egg, sausage, and cheese sandwich and a bloody caesar. The bloody caesar was interesting - for those of you who don't know, a bloody caesar is made with clamato juice rather than regular tomato so it has a briny taste to it. I'm not really sure if it's made well here since it's the first time I've ever had it, but my boyfriend seemed to like it. Both food orders came with yummy home fries and fresh fruit. I accidentally ordered a side of cheese (I thought my meal came with it but read carefully - it says OR) so be sure to pay attention to the menu. Everything was delicious and the service was good. If you're meal doesn't come with the home fries then you should definitely order a side of em - they were some of the best home fries I've ever had."}
{"text":"The menu is almost diner big but the food was pretty decent. Not the best poutine I've ever had but the seafood risotto was a hearty, tasty dish. Pitchers of Fin du Monde were cheap too!

However during our meal the waitstaff seemed to completely forget about the people sitting outside. We had to send our expedition parties to find where the waitresses had disappeared to and even after asking inside staff for help nobody appeared for 20 minutes or more. At one point the music they were playing broke and the speakers started emitting super loud skipping music. This wasn't fixed for about 10 minutes because...no staff ever came outside and nobody could hear it. Eventually a manager had to step in and take over thing which is a shame as it was doing well until the staff stopped caring."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was spectacular. I came here wanting to try the universal breakfast, but reading the description, I think it was too much food so I settled for some good o'l eggs Benedict. The server was really nice, she kept coming back to check if I needed anything or to refill my coffee. When my plate arrived, I was surprised to see that fruit came with it. That was a bonus for me and let me say I've been to a few spots in NYC for brunch and the eggs Benedict here outweighed the competitors in New York lol it was just exploding with flavor and it was filling even without the fruit. The Canadian ham/bacon c'mon the maple taste, oh yeah much much better than NYC version lol next time I'll take a crack at the infamous universal breakfast plate"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. Was so warm this weekend, open glass doors and outdoor seating was beautiful. Food was excellent- seafood risotto and fettuccine alfredo were a hit. Waitstaff was attentive and friendly. Called ahead for reservations. Wish I'd known about this place for brunch as the menu looked fantastic. Will definitely got this place again next trip."}
{"text":"I ate here on my first day in Montreal. It was great. The service was amazing. I sat at the bar, and the staff interacted with me. They played reggae and I watched some staff dance to it. Haha! I've had my first poutine there. You must try their delish salmon sandwich.

So yummy!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, but good and caring. The menu is just too long, do I really need to go through dozens of choices under each category? The food was delivered hot. Didn't try the limp fries again, so went for onion rings instead, which were nice. 

Still don't get their burgers... British burger has swiss cheese & Louisiana burger has swiss cheese?!?!"}
{"text":"Close to Peel and Sherbrooke where there are several hotels. That makes it a great place for breakfast. Frequent coffee fill ups and full breakfast - eggs, meat, bread, potatoes, and fruit - for under 10$. Friendly service for an American. Opportunity to eat in open air area."}
{"text":"I love eggs Benedict and I was not disappointed when trying it here! I went on a busy Saturday for brunch and was seated right away and received my food within 10 minutes of sitting down. It was not a long wait at all! The fruit is fresh and Daniela our server made sure we were well taken care of! Hope to return soon."}
{"text":"Un de mes endroits préférés pour bruncher !
Tout y est, la qualité, le gout et le cadre vraiment sympathique. Je recommande vivement !"}
{"text":"Un de mes endroits préférés pour bruncher ! Les salades sont également délicieuses.
Un endroit incontournable à Montréal pour se faire plaisir !"}
{"text":"This is pretty much all you could ask for in a breakfast restaurant. We wanted to avoid the \"chain\" experience and try something a little more authentic, and this was perfect. The place was starting to fill up when we arrived around 10:30am on a Saturday, so definitely try to go earlier to avoid wait times. The menu was interesting and diverse, without omitting the classic bacon & eggs if that's what's you're going for. I had the spinach, shallots and cheddar omelette and my boyfriend had a classic with crepes - we both loved all of it. The potatoes, toast, various meats, eggs - all wonderful. The service was great. A bit of a wait time on getting the bill but that's just a testament to how popular this place is."}
{"text":"I have had brunch here a few times.  The brunch is always good...especially the home fries!  Love the strawberry mimosas!  I got the breakfast burger the last time I went and it looked and tasted delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're having friends visiting and you want to show them the authentic side of Montréal brunches, this is not where you want to take them. Their dishes are all bland tasting and hideous looking. The whole place looks more like an food assembly line than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast - crepes, eggs, fruit, sausage and to top it off, cretons with toast. So good."}
{"text":"We sat down and waited and waited and waited... no tea, no coffee, nothing while the lady at the table next to us who sat down after us got her drink.  Got up and left and as we were leaving this woman rushes after us and says \"would you like to order?\". No, we are patient but the service was awful.  And the food didn't even look that good.  The manager did come out and graciously apologized but really, it was too late..."}
{"text":"Universel was a little bit of a walk from the hotel but it was a Saturday morning after a night out and we were looking for a good quality breakfast.  The reviews on Yelp said this was the place to go so we headed over.

When we got there, it wasn't exactly what I expected; I was picturing more of a breakfast diner.  This place was huge with a big indoor and outdoor section and the entire place was packed.  We managed to get a table quickly but a line formed soon after we sat down.

The menu was impressive.  There were probably 8 different eggs Benedict and all of them looked awesome.  I ordered a fruit smoothie to start and it was delicious.  For breakfast I had an eggs Benedict that came with salmon, spinach, and cream cheese.  It was pretty amazing.  I didn't take advantage but it seemed like they had a pretty impressive drink menu.  The 20+ person bachelor party sitting behind me was taking full advantage with breakfast shots.

Overall I bumped this down to four stars because of the atmosphere.  It was a little larger and more crowded than I would have liked for a breakfast place, but the food was very good and the service was decent."}
{"text":"Universel was great! We made reservations for 9 AM on a Saturday, and when we arrived, there were a number of people outside but not too many inside. It's worth noting that by the time we left, the inside had filled up, and there were a ton of people inside. I ordered an egg white omelet, which was flavorful and well cooked, and the portions were quite large. The other benedicts and omelets at the table were deemed okay (nothing spectacular but tasty)."}
{"text":"Food was ok, but the servers there were slow and not attentive. It took forever to get a refill on coffee. I won't go back."}
{"text":"This place is very average. Meh would be the best descriptor. The cappuccino had bath water foam piled on top and the drink was bitter. The fresh fruit that comes with meals is edible at best.  My omelet was ok. Not horrible but nothing to write home about. There are so many good eats in Montreal, I would skip this place."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! I was by myself and got a nice table. Waitress was helpful and nice. She came to check on my several times. I had the strawberry and hazelnut spread crepes. Delicious!!! And so much food!! The strawberry mimosa was good too. Service was fast and food was hot when it arrived. 

Definitely would go again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for Sunday brunch while in Montreal.  All I can say is wow. Great food. Great smoothies. Big portions. 

This place is well known, so expect a wait. But it's worth it. And they have covered outdoor seating as well.

Check it out."}
{"text":"I give three stars for the service, two for the atmosphere and five for the food.

The food was INCREDIBLE. I had the eggs benedict with bacon, and it came with potatoes and a whole bowl of fruit on the side. Everything was well cooked, well seasoned, and lovely. The fruit was a really nice touch.

I understand that we came for Sunday brunch which is the busiest time of the week, but we were told a 10 minute wait, and it turned into 30 as we watched party after party get taken in. Once we were seated(in the outdoor area), I realized how closely the tables were situated. Close enough that the guests at the next table over had to get up and let us through to our seats. I could smell someone's body odor from tables over. Gross.

They've got the food down pat, but they should work on the comfort angle for their guests, maybe sacrifice a couple tables so that existing guests can have room to breathe."}
{"text":"Summary: Good enough for decent food at an ok price when you don't want to find a place

Universal Dejeuner Grillades was close to the hotel where my friend and I stayed at in October 2015. They have hearty portions and a large variety of items to choose from; the food was average for this type of restaurant. I would not go out of my way to go to this restaurant. There's nothing inherently 'Montreal' about it, the crepes are average and can only be ordered until 5pm, I think, which is when they stop serving their breakfast menu. It's not great, it's not bad, it's average and meets the need of the local traveller."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés pour le souper. On annonçait des moules/frites et ça m'a attirée!

Quand on m'a servi les moules, il y avait une forte odeur de fruit de mer, ce qui n'est jamais bon signe avec ce genre de plat. Elles avaient aussi une drôle de texture. En revanche, la sauce au cognac était excellente. Peut-être seulement une mauvaise \"batch\" de moules? 

La musique était un peu envahissante. Mais le service était excellent!"}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended and I'm happy to report it lived up to its reputation. I needed to organize a work lunch for thirty or so people ... on a couple of day's notice! Universal to the rescue! Afterwards I received many positive comments on the choice, it seemed there really was something for everyone. 

I liked the fact that one can choose between breakfast OR lunch and dinner. I had the Mexican breakfast and was very happy with my choice: two burritos (actually more like enchiladas, but hey, this isn't a Mexican restaurant so who really cares) filled with scrabbled eggs, beans and cheese, topped with cheese (not a gross excessive amount though, just enough), guacamole and salsa, and served with home fries and fruit (an actual little bowl of fruit, not the couple of sad pieces of fruit some places serve). 

My only complaint is that the place is packed and loud.  But that's to be expected when the food is decent and the people happy. The staff had no problem managing so many people, and that's what counts."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch at Universel while visiting Montreal for the weekend. We made a reservation the night before which I definitely recommend as the place was very crowded. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and they were SPECTACULAR. They kept the coffee and water flowing which is always an added plus. If I ever return to Montreal, I will be back to Universel!"}
{"text":"I like this place for brunch. Good quality, although the portions are small. I'm kinda hungry when I leave this place, but it's a nice place overall. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for a traditional, ridiculously filling, and relatively cheap brunch. Their portions are massive and rely heavily on salt and oil for taste. It's enjoyable in the moment but leaves me painfully full after the meal. 

The service is usually slow, and you'll have to wait a decent amount of time to be served, especially on weekends. Still, it's definitely one of the cheapest brunch places, and there are so many things to choose from! I usually leave feeling satisfied but not delighted, and yet I somehow always seem to find myself coming back. It's probably the fact that I live so close..."}
{"text":"This is a great resteraunt right next to the Omni Hotel.  I went here several times and placed to-go orders.  The food is absolutely delicious, fair to moderately priced (for Canada), and the waiters and waitresses were very polite.  Definitely a favorite of mine in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Brunch is okay, good portions but basic menu. Diner is very tasty & love the deco ! Service is great."}
{"text":"My weekend long Montreal trip included a lot of eating and this place was one of them.

There were four of us and we went on a Sunday morning, although it looked very busy we were seated almost immediately. They did however ask us if our entire group was there (I think that makes a difference).

They have a beautiful sunny sun room which was full and we couldn't get a table there, so we were shown to our booth. The indoor space is very sunny too (on a sunny day of course). The place was clean and looked upscale. The menu was very extensive and since there were four of us, we did end up trying different things. Friend No.1 had the Mexican Breakfast which I did not try but he said it was good not great. Friend No.2 had Eggs Benedict which she said was really good. Mr. H had a veggie omelette and that was yumm. He also tried L'éternité a fruit smoothie with strawberries, banana, mango, yogurt and honey, this was really good. I on the other had tried the Universal Breakfast, its a huge breakfast with french toast, home fries, sausage, tuna, fruits and scrambled eggs (it comes with coffee too). I also tried a smoothie called L'univers which was ok. 

All in all I thought the food was good but nothing made me go 'omg! this is so tasty'. It tasted good like any place that charges $15 for a breakfast should, but on my next visit I won't mind skipping it."}
{"text":"La terasse est superbe, le staff super gentil. Le menu est le même qu'à l'autre location (sur St-Denis). Les patates a déjeuner goûtaient le carton mais le reste était bon ! Bon prix pour beaucoup de bouffe.

vous pouvez voir mon avis sur l'autre location Universel sur ma page."}
{"text":"How is it that a restaurant that is so packed and has a a 30 minute waiting period to be seated still manage to keep the servers happy and helpful and the food good?  No idea...but the management at Universel knows a thing or two about great food and service. We had a wonderful time here. My wife ordered a highly customized dish (despite a large menu) and gave what I though were to many instructions. The server kept noting it on his pad and said..\"it's no problem madam\".  They got it right...how terrific and The food was awesome. We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Mon resto habituel pour le dîner : les menus midi sont très bon marché et toujours savoureux : comprennent la soupe ou le jus de légume, le repas principal, café et dessert du jour pour environ 15$. Le service est très bien et le proprio est toujours près pour s'assurer du bon service et du bien-être des clients.

Meilleur plat : les bénédictines. (servi jusqu'a 16h pour les lève-tard)"}
{"text":"Great breakfast, had the loaded omelet that was well portioned and tasty.  Eggs Benedict were also a big hit at our table."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service by far and the food is average at best. I would recommend the location on St-Denis if you want to try it out."}
{"text":"Good breakfast and a very nice room. We came here because it was so close to our hotel and every time we had walked past it had a huge line up. The benny plates were huge and everything was delicious. Prices are a bit high, but you're paying for the location and the slightly upscale surroundings. 

Service was OK. Friendly enough, but never refilled coffee, though other sections of the restaurant seemed to get more prompt service."}
{"text":"Went on a quiet Monday morning, service was a bit slow because there were only 2 or three servers on the floor when we were there (and the restaurant is very large!). Menu was diverse, with plenty of classic breakfast options, really liked having the option of choosing healthy foods (even though I didn't).

Portion sizes were decent for eggs, definitely enough for a brunch, but the French toast was humongous: enough for two people, for sure. Maybe that explains the $14 price tag. Cappuccino was enjoyable.

As a college student, this isn't somewhere I would go often as it is expensive for breakfast, nothing I can't make myself at home. Good ambience and more geared for an older crowd."}
{"text":"Great friendly service, and the food is amazing as always. Been here before and I can't help but get the florentine every time."}
{"text":"Their eggs benedict. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Too bad we found this place on the last day of our stay in Montreal. Located by my favorite place in Montreal (St Louis Square), Universel has something for everyone.

The menu selection was overwhelming, everything from crepes, to grilled cheese, to waffles, to parfait, to omelette's, to a dozen other things. We sat reading and re-reading the menu for almost 20 minutes, there were so many delicious choices. 

I finally chose the grilled cheese sandwich with home fries, while my dining partner choose eggs Benedict. We also got a blueberry crepe to share with real maple syrup. To say that we were impressed is an understatement. 

The food was delicious, the prices were perfect, and the service was friendly. I miss this place already."}
{"text":"Pretty decent brunch place near where we were staying. The portions are HUGE for the price and the decor of the restaurant is very welcoming. We ordered two dishes of the Salmon Lox, one dish of the blueberry crepes, a banana/nutella crepe, eggs, strawberry mimosas, coffee and orange juice. 

Everything was very delicious however I noticed that they didn't give us a bread basket compared to the other tables. The service could have been better though so I would have to deduct a star for those two negatives. 

Probably wouldn't come here again but it was a good brunch place nonetheless!"}
{"text":"This is a great brunch place to go with your family or friends! Make sure you make a reservation for brunch on the weekends or else you should expect a minimum 15 minute wait! The menu provided various brunch options, but not as much as Eggspectation (good and bad: less options, but easier to choose what you wanted). I got a ham, onion omelette with fruit, hash browns and toast. The meal was delicious! You get more than what you pay for! It came to about $15 and I wasn't able to finish my entire meal. t would definitely recommend coming here for brunch!"}
{"text":"Food was average-to-good. The breakfast poutine was impossible to stop eating, omelettes were ok. The place was jam-packed. Coffee was drinkable. Not a place I would rush back to but was decent fare at decent prices."}
{"text":"Géniale , les serveurs sont souriant, toujours un petit mots, un de mes Resto préféré pour le brunch. Le rapport qualité prix est là, petit et gros mangeur y trouvent leurs compte."}
{"text":"This is a True eye candy for me. On a Friday afternoon-it was fully packed. Everybody seems to be enjoying themselves. No one looking at their phone- purely social human connection.amazing indeed! I ordered seafood pasta- it was fresh and amazingly good. Servers were quick, fast and helpful. However this is not a place to dine if you want peace and quiet."}
{"text":"Initially, we wanted to try another restaurant in the area but probably because of the weather there was no room left ....so we had to find another spot...as it was raining and Universal was the closest one around well we ended up going there. We arrived around 8, the restaurant was half empty, we were seated pretty quickly. We ordered Madagascar mussels with fries and fried calamari with veggies and rice. Everything was good but nothing was extraordinary, However, the service was good, the prices were ok and Universel has a really nice atmosphere. Overall experience: 3.5"}
{"text":"Sehr freundlicher Service, der uns sogar noch auf die kurz vor dem Ende steht in der happy Hour hin wies.
Leckeres Essen in zentraler Lage gekommen, innen waren die Temperaturen aber sehr kalt, obwohl es draußen mit gut 20° angenehm war."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch right by the Omni Montreal if you are visiting. Retro vibe, diner feels, and great prices! Would definitely revisit if I'm back in Canada!"}
{"text":"Just arrived in town and wanted some comfort food late at night.  We ordered two burgers with onion rings for take out.  ....everything was delicious! all the condiments and everything we needed were thoughtfully provided with the order without even having to ask.  The 'American' burgers are on an interesting pretzel bun with cream cheese and fried onions - Delish! and accompanied by very large and tasty, crispy onion rings

Delicious Poutine, friendly barkeep!, the roast beef sandwich was delish.... really liked their gravy."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous brunch on the terrace (nicely protected by windows which can be adjusted).  It looks a little sketchy from outside, but be brave, it is quite nice inside. The menu is fairly extensive & appealing. Their juices are amazing mixes of fresh puréed fruits-the Asteroid (raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, cranberries & honey) was a symphony of fruit in our mouths.  The 2 eggs, bacon, ham and sausages with toast, coffee and potatoes (crispy good!) was generous in portion & taste. But go for the French crepes-they are SO good!  2 of us shared the crepes with assorted fresh fruit and custard and had plenty to fill us for the day. There was easily 2 cups of fruit (kiwi, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, kiwi, apples, grapes, melons and oranges. The crepes were perfectly crisp and tender. The servers were attentive and pleasant. Suffice to say, we found a new favorite!
Returned and can say breakfast pizza and jambon and egg bagel are delish as well."}
{"text":"This place is always an great breakfast joint.  The location on St. Denis usually is always packed on weekend mornings.  If you head over you would likely be standing in linen outside for 20 min to get into a place that seats you in cramped quarters because of all the people.  

The place is great, service is on point and price is great( maybe a buck or two cheaper would be perfect but there's tonnes demand so why make it cheaper?)  

Only regret I had last time is not ordering the Mexican breakfast that everyone else at my table ordered!


BTW new location on peel or Stanley or something is modern, spacious and still great quality and price we know andnlove! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Assez bon, le service est ok. Il y a une ambiance assez sympa pour les brunch (les brunch sont super bon). J'adore leur milkshake."}
{"text":"If you are in the neighbourhood or are staying near the Golden Mile in Montreal.  You must visit this place for breakfast.

The selection is great, the service prompt and friendly, the food well prepared, and the portions are huge.  Don't try to finish one of these big boys yourself, bring a friend and share.

The prices are amazingly reasonable, and puts nearby hotel restaurants to shame."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our breakfast here on St. Patrick's Day. The place was fairly empty so we were able to order and receive our food quite quickly. We couldn't believe the size of the plates of food! There was so much, we ended up not being able to finish it all. The fruit crepe was very generous in both size and the amount of fruit loaded into the crepe. The hash browns and fruit juice (essentially a smoothie) were probably the best parts of the meal - so fresh and flavorful. We left stuffed but happy with our breakfast choice!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on a saturday because all the other places were way too crowded. The food is ok. The benedictine's sauce was quite normal as well as the breakfast poutine. The best part is the huge bowl of fruits that came with it which made me feel like i was somewhat eating healthy."}
{"text":"Here's one of the best downtown restaurant to go for a breakfast ! The food is good and the service excellent. And they actually serve real maple syrup. 

So if you want a good place to eat in the morning : Hurry up and arrived before 9 am ( to avoid line up !) relax and enjoy a nice breakfast !  


C'est une des meilleur endroit à Montréal au centre-ville pour déguster un excellent déjeuner, de plus le service est très bon.

Si vous chercher un bon endroit ou manger le matin : dépêcher-vous, arriver avant 9 heure am ( afin d'éviter la file) et relaxer en dégustant un excellent déjeuner !"}
{"text":"Think of it as a fancier American diner. Food was good, but nothing to write home about. It was very busy when we were there. We went for breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a party of 13! The service was phenomenal. Everyone's food came on time. The staff was helpful, knowledgeable and welcoming for us tourists! They even took our group picture! I had green tea and it looked like I was about to have a tea party! Very well presented. I ordered eggs Benedict with bacon and it came with fruits and home fries. Everything was delicious! Our stay in Montreal was beyond amazing  and this topped it off! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Visiting on vacation from NYC.  Entered the restaurant but there was no hostess at the hostess station.  After a couple minutes, a busboy seated us and brought us one menu for the 3 of us.  Busboy returned a minute later with 2 more menus.

20 minutes went by and not a single waiter came over to take our order.  Horrible customer service in what is otherwise a fabulous city.

We left, and nobody even noticed.  There appeared to be exactly one waitress handling both the indoor and outdoor seating.

On our way out, there was a couple waiting at the hostess station, but there was no hostess there to greet them.  I thought about telling them what our experience was, but decided to just post this on Yelp instead."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with a friend. The restaurant was busy which is a good sign. Food was excellent and so was the service. I give 4 stars for the wait to be seated"}
{"text":"I had their mushroom eggs Benedict which had cream cheese in it which ruined the taste for me. My friend had their chicken cajun sandwich. They served it in generous portion for its price with a side of fries. But in terms of taste, it was ok.  The place looks nice and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Universals menu is in fact universal which ultimately means too much variety for any of it to be good. The meal was less than memorable and anyone who gave this above 2 stars shouldn't be listened to. If you want less than stellar food in an absolutely abysmal space I suggest trying this out but seeing as your downtown your options are endless and this should be the last stop on your list."}
{"text":"Came here thanks to Yelpers!!!

So glad I did! Great prices for the amount of food our group got and such a diverse selection!

I got the Eggs Benedict, which was great. My friends got the French Toast and the omelet. What I love about this place is that the dishes we got included fruit and home fries...what a win! I left full and satisfied without breaking my wallet!

Knocking off one star because of slow slow service."}
{"text":"Premiere fois a ce restaurant depuis des années, depuis le demenagement de la succursale de la rue cherrier, je me suis rendu pour un brunch un dimanche matin , personnel courtois, bon service pour les accomodations, l'eau ... la portion etais ok , le goût bon ..."}
{"text":"Classique mais très efficace pour lutter contre les grosses faims du matin ! Et de tout autre moment dans la journée. Service efficace et très aimable !"}
{"text":"Huge menu!!! So much selection a bit of something for everyone. Fresh orange juice is amazing, had a mimosa it was delicious. Had a mixed plate with French toast with banana and Nutella, home fries, bacon, toast and eggs was so fresh and filling. Also tried the cappuccino and it was smooth with the right bite to the espresso."}
{"text":"Très bon resto, confortable et bien tenu. Le menu est varié, les proportions bonnes (assez, sans être bourratif), les prix très raisonnables.

Le personnel est compétent et aimable. Très recommandé !"}
{"text":"Had brunch on a Sunday morning and can't stop thinking about it.  This was the best place we ate at the entire trip.  Eggs Benedict, crepes, and the home fries were delicious.  Fresh squeezed orange juice and nice, strong coffee.  We sat at the bar, which worked out because of a long wait to get a table.  Service was perfect; highly recommend sitting at the bar for brunch."}
{"text":"Loved everything about the place. The food was delicious. And nice modern fancy decor. I had a breakfast pizza. So different and tasty, sweet and salty with a hint of cinnamon. I ate it all! My boyfriend got the breakfast poutine which was also amazing although really heavy. The chai latte was also delicious. The only Negative point was that it was very loud and over crowded."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. They had a very extensive menu for breakfast dishes. The portions were very large. I ordered the Universel Eggs Benedict, and could barely finish everything that came with the order. I highly recommend ordering a coffee with baileys Irish cream. They serve it with a very delicious whipped cream and the rim of the glass is covered in sugar. Would definitely eat here again upon my next visit to Montreal. Pricing was on par with other brunch restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow! Amazingggg food and huge portions. You will not leave hungry if you come here. The service is amazing considering how packed it was on the Sunday morning that I went. The owner/manager walks around and helps his staff with ordinary tasks like pouring more coffee for the customers. If I come back to Montreal, I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, we loved it.
Huge and trendy, finely furnished.
The staff is perfect, friendly, smily and fast, really professional.
The food is very good, I've been there twice and with my  wife we tried a lot of plates, everything is delicious and very big.
Pasta is good, I'm from Italy, I know pasta, and their way to prepare pasta is good, not great, but very good.
They have 2 kinds of menu, one for dinner and breakfast and another one for lunch.
Both are various and with a lot of choice.
Will go Back to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"Huge portions but the actual food does not taste good. It's cheap and good if you like leaving bloated. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place with a patio.  Good Customer service, clean and modern."}
{"text":"Me gustó mucho el lugar tome el almuerzo pero se ve que para el desayuno es genial. La atención súper rápida y la comida deliciosa , recomiendo los medallones son geniales con unos camarones y una deliciosa ensalada de berenjenas , cerveza y vino muy bueno."}
{"text":"Our air b-n-b host told us we need to try this place and I'm so glad he told us about it. The space is beautiful and the staff are wonderful! The food was also perfect and the coffee was good too"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good but service disappointed me. They waitress got my order wrong twice and then claimed that what I read on the menu was not what was actually written. Didn't care to argue. Also I was charged 2$ for bread that I didn't even want and apparently \"came\" with my eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"A no from me. Attracts lots of tourists but definitely the worst brunch place in Montreal. The food is mediocre at best and there is an incredible amount of people that find things in their food. Last time I visited Universel, I found a piece of plastic in my pasta. This sparked a conversation with the rest of the table where one had found a hair, and a bug in previous visits. If you want to find a good brunch restaurant in the area, just walk down the street!"}
{"text":"Regular breakfast, large portions. They have a few of eggs benedict dishes. The food has too much sauce in it, felt like the entire dish was covered in it. 

I ordered the universal eggs benedict. Huge amount of food. I suggest asking for sauce on the side.

The place gets pretty busy for brunch so try to make a reservation."}
{"text":"We ate here for first time last year, and it was simply amazing! So naturally, we had to go back again during this visit. 
If I had to rate this restaurant last year, I would have given it a 5, but unfortunately our experience just didn't live up to our expectations. 
Now, don't get me wrong. This is still a wonderful restaurant and I would totally recommend it to others. In retrospect, we were only 5 people during the first visit, and this time our party was 8, so that may have resulted in a slightly lower standard :(
I would still go back hoping that it may change my mind and push the rating up to 5 stars :)

{"text":"Such a great place for value and quality of food! The service was prompt and very friendly. You're meal is usually served with some type of fruits and the toast u get on the side is always buttered!"}
{"text":"Very very fast service and delicious food. The French toast is to die for and the potatoes were enjoyable as well. Incredible value for the price."}
{"text":"Service initially wasn't fantastic, but towards the end of the meal when I was getting ready to pay they warmed up a bit.  No one came and checked on me, even though every single table around me had my waiter come up and ask how things were going. 

The food itself was not bad.  Large portion sizes, but inconsistent.  The french toast was good, the beans were good, the potatoes were a bit bland, the eggs were cold, and the fruit was hard and tasted off.  

Overall, a decent meal, but I will not be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Slow service and loud Resto
I waited 30 minutes to get yogurt with fruits
I was alone in the section and restaurant half full
Should I mention this was my lunch break and I had t leave before finishing because I didn't want to be late for work
Overall very disappointed"}
{"text":"Good service, good food, and they do brunch till late in the day and maybe all day.

I was visiting Montreal and was staying just around the corner from this place, it's easy to walk past as the signage isn't too obvious unless your across the street. The food is good, and my friends enjoyed the smoothies, they also serve pitchers of beer and probably wine. It's looks classy and all sorts of people seem to eat here, from hung over tourists, locals with their wee'uns (kids), and young lovers. On a busy morning they pleasantly found seating for our party of 9!

I enjoyed their omelet, and their Universal breakfast that came with choice of meat, 2 eggs, fried potatoes, baked bean, crepes/french toast/waffles with real maple syrup, and a small side of a pork dish I wasn't familiar with.  They also serve fresh squeezed orange juice. However, I didn't think the coffee matched the quality of the rest of the food, but it was drinkable. Their sandwiches and salads looked good also.

On a funny note, one of my friends wanted pancakes and the waitress told him \"pancakes are for children\" and he could only have crepes, French toast, or waffles. :)"}
{"text":"Very good value. Huge location with lots of seating. Loved sitting right by the big open window leading to the street. 

Poutine is a LOT and heavy so order if you can handle it with your entrees! My pasta came with a Caesar salad. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"Looking for a nearby brunch destination to chase our hunger and hangovers away, we popped into Universel on a Sunday morning at the recommendation of the hotel receptionist.  And we were not disappointed.

Our lovely, red-haired waitress was very attentive and patient with our rather rusty French.  I had the eggs benedict with bacon, homefries, and a very generous fruit salad.  He had a combination plate which featured scrambled eggs, homefries, deux crepes avec sucre et beurre, creton (pate) with toast, and sausages.  I traded a benedict for a crepe, which I enhanced with a nice pour of real maple syrup (I know it's Canada, but I was quite surprised and pleased that they offered us a huge bottle of it with our meal). 

The one minor let-down was my chocolat chaud. It seemed to consist of warm milk and Hersey's syrup.  It didn't appear to be on the menu though, so I assume they improvised for me, and I can't really complain about that!

Everything was delicious, service was excellent, prices were reasonable, the decor was chic, and we left feeling revived for our long journey home."}
{"text":"If I'm too lazy to leave my lil' downtown nook and I'm craving breakfast or brunch, I'll come to Universel. It is by no means a favourite of mine, but definitely not bad either. There's nothing particularly special about this place and the food is just in the 'fine' range, but the place itself looks nice and is never quite empty so it offers a decent ambiance, a reasonable price, and is within proximity to everything downtown. So it's okay, I guess, meh."}
{"text":"Came here for an office party and wasn't totally impressed. 
There was good and bad.

The good: The place was nice, the bathroom clean, and the mussels were tasty.
I ordered the roast beef sandwich and onion rings, it was good the  rings were sweet the beef was tender but not moist. My meal came with a vegetable puree soup, lacked salt and any real flavor, but it was passable.

The Bad: The calamari were something you would get out of a frozen box. The Nachos burnt, and when I left my seat for about 15 minutes to go chat with co-workers at the other end of the table, the other half of my sandwich was taken away.  The waitress didn't even ask anyone if I was done, or bothered to see if I was around to ask if I was done or if I wanted it to be boxed to go.
Though the sandwich was not toooo expensive, I ended up paying 20 bucks for half a sandwich. 
In any other circumstances I would have said something or not left a tip but it is the holidays and she did have 18 other people to tend to. So, I let it go.

Would I go back again? Probably not.
It was nothing special, with so many other places to go downtown, I wouldn't settle for this place. But hey, that's just me."}
{"text":"I love this place ate lunch and dinner there both were very good, with good service.  The mussels in white wine sauce, tuna sandwich, salmon sandwich...all good.  Surprisingly quiet at night but still very good."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place.  Staff was attentive but our waitress did seem very indifferent.  Crepes were good, smoothie was good and the seasoning on the home fries was awesome."}
{"text":"Great hangover cure. The eggs Benedict are a stable. Don't forget to have a smoothy with your meal (although you may want to split it with someone). 
Decided to try out the breakfast burrito and was unimpressed with the fillings. The beans tasted like baked beans from a can and the guacamole was average."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Ordered a waffle that the waitress recommended and it came out ice cold. They replaced it and gave me another one, which was also cold."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast! Very busy Saturday morning, but great service. Big menu selection. Egg Benedict awesome, fresh squeezed orange juice so delicious. Highly recommend ."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast because of Yelp reviews. My husband and I were disappointed. The eggs Benedict was cold and the waitstaff never around for coffee refill. Will not be back."}
{"text":"The food here is always excellent. I Highly recommend this place. I tried the strawberry Mimosa this morning ..... Delicious."}
{"text":"Walked in shortly before close craving some desert.  The manager greeted us warmly and our server was just as friendly.  We order 4 deserts: crème brûlée, King Kong cake, chocolate coco, and blueberry cheesecake.  Personally my two favorites were the chocolate coco and the blueberry cheesecake.  Done to perfection!  The others were good but those two were outstanding!  Had a great conversation with the manager afterward.  Job well done!  Hope to be back to try your regular menu!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast and immediately liked this place. Plenty of tables, including ones outside so on nice days you can dine al fresco. The menu is extensive, so you are bound to find something you like here.
I had the Universel Omelet, loaded with bacon, sausage, ham, red onions, mushrooms and cheddar cheese (I passed on the green peppers). I could barely finish this tasty behemoth. My friends had the apple, bacon and cheddar crepe (delicious, huge, hard to stop eating) and the basic ham and eggs (good job with the classic).
Service was very prompt and attentive, and the coffee cups were never empty for long.
The only reason this place didn't get 5 stars is the price - $15 for an omelet - but it was really good so we went back again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! \"Up beat\" atmosphere (music was at a comfortable level) and very popular apparently.. the place was packed."}
{"text":"We were here for lunch. Stopped by around 4pm. The place was pretty much empty. Our waitress was friendly & attentive. We got the fettucini alfredo & a poutine. They were delicious! Perfect! Flawless! We really can't say anything bad about our meal. 

1 fettucini alfredo & 1 poutine, all total was $23.51. It was definitely worth it. 

Fast & Friendly Service!
Generous Portion! 
Great Value!
Absolutely Delicious Food!

Highly recommended! 

It's definitely as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Had the most amazing experience at Universel. It was a very busy Sunday morning and the restaurant seemed pretty full but we were seated right away. Waiters seemed to speak French and English fluently. We ordered a combo meal, two eggs meal, and universel breakfasts. We also started with lattes which were prepared well and delicious.

My universel breakfast was HUGE; the portions are pretty crazy. The meal came with the crepe, the potatoes, two eggs, toast, choice of meat, baked beans, and fruit. This came out to be $18 Canadian dollars which is like $14 USD. Amazing deal especially for the cost.  For the crepe I added strawberries, bananas, and Nutella. The breakfast potatoes were seasoned very well. I don't typically like breakfast potatoes but I actually loved these. 

Service was great and we were attended to frequently. Great service, food, and experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch place with lots of options.  Great service and value.  Perfect for travellers needing to fuel up and feel at home.  We had the waffles, French toast and eggs Benedict, which were great staples but they do them expertly.  The potato hash is super tasty and a meal on its own.  Well-deserved rating for convenience, value, deliciousness and great service!"}
{"text":"I woke up after a heavy night of drinking and decided I needed some breakfast I stumbled many streets until I found this place called the universal the outside is nothing to look at as there's a glass enclosure that has tables that I assumed eventually get taken however I stumbled my way inside to meet the Ukrainian waitress. She was very pleasant as was Miguel ( I assume that was his name) who was bussing tables I ordered a Coca-Cola as I was all out of sorts in the morning and I loaded up on a delicious breakfast it came soon after like I did the night before hiyyyooo.

The breakfast was delicious the French toast amazing the bacon crispy all in all it was a fantastic visit minus the sleazy French accent in the background but that's none of my business"}
{"text":"Location: On Peel above de Maisonneuve. The closest subway is Peel (green) and street parking is available, though will be difficult to find unless you're there first thing in the a.m.

The place: The space is quite big and also includes a fairly large terrace. The lighting is a bit dim but as long as I can read the menu and see what I'm eating, I'm good!

The goods: So I went two days in a row because I needed major sustenance after two back to back U2 shows =-D.  Both days I ordered the veggie omelet (sans sweet potatoes or goat cheese) - this was served with home fries and coffee, and I ordered a side of sausage. The omelet was pretty darn big and these guys don't skimp on the potatoes. There were three sausages. I have nothing to say about anything - the food was great and my friends left satiated and satisfied. We definitely plan to go back. The only thing I should point out is that the coffee isn't that great.

Service: Both days were great. The wait staff is attentive and our water and coffee was constantly being re-filled. 

Price point: I think with tip, my breakfast came out to $20. 

This is definitely a great place to check out when you're in the downtown core and in the mood for a great brunch."}
{"text":"The best service we got in Montreal. Beautiful my decorated and perfect for brunch with a large menu. Great prices for good sized portions. I loved the universel fresh juice. The oatmeal was great and I enjoyed my fruit bowl. The home fries and western omelette were also perfect. Wonderful for families, groups or dates!"}
{"text":"Food is good service is ok and music is not great. Techno music while you eat is not that great.
Other than that, the food was good. I had the salmon which was good. My girlfriend had the beef and it was surprisingly tender. We also had the 2 for 1 on the wine which is a great thing."}
{"text":"Visiting here from U.S.A. and the breakfast was terrific.  Veggie omelet with goat cheese was perfectly done.  The home potatoes were amazing seasoned with herbs.   Coffee refilled multiple times, excellent service, very friendly.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. They serve breakfast at lunch time. The food arrived promptly, was fresh, and had great ingredients and taste."}
{"text":"Horrible attitude... very bad table system. Even if you are only two, but still waiting for your friend or partner, and also even if you are 6.5 month pregnant and blocking the way, they won't sit you until your friend is there. So... what's the point? Piss your customers off? Im still going to take a table for two if I come alone, right? Anyway I thought the magager and host were very rude and not helpful at all. We just left and will never go back."}
{"text":"Super service, everyone was friendly and polite from the moment we walked in. They have big dinner and kid portions. The service was fast and we had a wonderful time. Nice place to eat with family with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Good spot for average to good food to eat; nothing extra ordinary. I went to Universel on Peel street few times; they have the same standards, nothing exceeds expectations.

Service is friendly and quick. It's a huge place, so getting a place inside or outside without reservations is no hassle. 

The menu is simple comfort food; nothing fancy. Taste of each dish is strictly alright. Average price too. 

I would recommend this place for breakfast especially; their milkshakes are really tasteful."}
{"text":"Pros: large portions, ambiance, coffee, people watching
Cons: slow service on weekends when it's busy

The food was mediocre at best, nothing to rave about.  We ordered the strawberry and banana crepe which was loaded with strawberries.  In our ham and cheese omelet, the cheese wasn't melted.  The fried potatoes were crispy and served hot.  We may be back to try other items, but at a less crowded hour."}
{"text":"Universel was a great stop to our long day of touristing.  The salads were superb and adorned with a variety of vegetables.  I had a chicken souvlaki salad which I would recommend to anyone that comes to this place.  My bf had a chicken club and we are beginning to realize that the chicken comes out pretty dry on the clubs in Montreal.  I would highly recommend extra mayo to go with it. 

We were easily tempted by the dessert case and had a slice of the blueberry tart.  Best decision EVER!!! So delicious and didn't break our wallets."}
{"text":"Sorry Yelpers, you guys disappointed me in this. I literally had the worst meal in Montreal or ever. My boyfriend and I came here for a quick lunch since we were staying at the Residence Inn (two buildings over). We ordered Lentil soup,  Escargot Au Gratin, and Roast Beef Sandwich.

The Lentil Soup was luke warm and looks like Minestrone soup without the pasta and flavor. It was extremely bland.

The Escargot Au Gratin was not the best, but also not the worst. I definitely had better. It looks like they just put the cheese on top of the Escargot and microwave it.

The Roast Beef Sandwich was not what I expected. I guess I was expecting more of a deli style roast beef, but that did not happen. The beef was in chunks and over cooked. It comes with brie cheese with tomatoes and lettuce. I ate less than half of the sandwich. I was so sad. 

I just left the toilet with massive diarrhea. I can't believe I flushed the toliet three times."}
{"text":"Pas mal du tout, excellent service rapide et courtois
Petits hics, beaucoup de monde et de bruit le WE, et aussi on était pas loin des cuisines et on s'est fait renversé un peu d'eau et de café sur nos manteaux qui étaient sur nos chaises... bof bof..
Je mets aussi un hic au smoothie Jupiter que j'ai trouvé très acide
Tout le reste, très bien!! Je recommande!"}
{"text":"Un \"diner\" bon prix. Le service a été impeccable, les assiettes belles et généreuses. Une belle adresse à conserver."}
{"text":"Excellente place pour bruncher entre amis ou amoureux!
Il y a toujours du monde mais l'attente vaut la peine!
Il y a beaucoup de choix, il y en a pour tous les goûts! Bon jus et smoothies aussi
Pas trop loin du métro Sherbrooke
A tester!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but I've never waited so long for breakfast food in my entire life. We sat for 15 minutes before someone even came to the table to ask for our order. By the time we got our food the kids had already spent all their happy energy and were now onto crabs. So we boxed up some left some behind skipped out on the joint without eating much."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot until it moved to St Denis street.

Now it is a much longer walk and out of the gay village.
So dispointing, as their old location is now vacant on rue Sherbrooke.
I miss their crepes with REAL maple syrup."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is very stylish and had great service. I was underwhelmed however with the breakfast especially the bacon which seemed like it came from one of those microwaveable pre-cooked bacon packs. Otherwise, the breakfast was fine but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday morning for brunch with a small group of friends and were seated quickly even with a large amount of walk in clientele. We were served quickly with a well prepared dishes and excellent prices."}
{"text":"Universel is a great way to start the day. The restaurant is in close proximity to several hotels and was a great place to grab a solid breakfast. The portions are generous and are much larger than they appear in photos. The prices is reasonable considering the amount of food that you get and the quality of ingredients used. The cappuccino was spot on and I made sure to savor every stop. Service with a smile always makes the food taste even better and makes for happy diners."}
{"text":"My five stars are based on my brunch experience, which was nothing short of perfect.  I went early on a Saturday morning, when the cafe was about as quiet as the walk up the usually bustling St Denis.  For about $9, I got a combo plate of 2 crepes with Canadian maple syrup, 2 eggs, a basket of toast, and perfectly crispy potatoes.  Even though I was pretty hungry, this generous breakfast was more than I could eat.  The coffee was good as well.

Although my sweetie wasn't as excited about his meal (he said his waffle had an odd \"fortune cookie\" taste), I thought it was one of the better meals I had while visiting Montreal.  The staff were kind and spoke English very well.

If I were a resident of Montreal, I could see myself spending lots of time here."}
{"text":"Pour nous une référence feel good, endroit sympatique, menu simple et apétissant, prix doux , les fauteuils les plus comfortables en ville, toujours un plaisir."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here the other day for a quick lunch on my break from classes and her break from work. I ordered the pesto, tomato and bocconcini sandwich on a small baguette bread. The French fries came in a mini basket made to put in the deep fryer which is a very cool idea I've never seen before. My sandwich was delicious and made the perfect lunch. My friend had a brie an mushroom omelette and said it was good also. After our meals we ordered a small chai and an iced mochachino... both very good and definitely hit the spot. We sat in a covered outdoor porch with a few other people so I believe our waitress forgot we were there at times, she took a long time to appear after we were finished our meal and wanted to order some drinks. For lunch time when everyone is on a schedule she should have been more efficient. However, the food was great and I would recommend this place to anyone because the menu is so eclectic you are bound to find something to satisfy any craving. :)"}
{"text":"Loved the food (ordered the universel egg benedict), delicious and even better to L'Avenue du Plateau (stake and egg benedict). For traveller like me try this place and even for locals you will definitely enjoy it."}
{"text":"Good place for kids. Food was mediocre for adults with discerning palates. I had the Mexican breakfast burrito. Beans tasted like pork and beans and the salsa was out of a jar. My wife had an omelette, which was a bit dry. Home fries were good, and the fresh fruit was nice. Kids meal was large, crepes were good. And, of course, being in Quebec, real maple syrup was served."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday and it was packed! It's a big restaurant but the tables are close together so it might not be the best idea to show up without a reservation if you are a big group (Keep in mind they only seat you once everyone in your party is present). My boyfriend and I were lucky and got a nice seat next to the window. It was a lovely sunny day.

The portions are huge! I ordered a Breakfast Poutine (new on the menu) and my boyfriend got the Universel Breakfast. Everything was delicious and filling. They have an extensive breakfast and lunch menu so you will find something to your liking. Prices are more than fair considering the amount of food you will get.

Service was also quick and friendly. Our server made sure we were satisfied and was just genuinely nice. 

A very good brunch place!"}
{"text":"J'aime bien le menu de cet endroit mais le service y est lent, l'endroit trop plein sur l'heure du dîner et la terrasse extérieur chauffé l'hiver vraiment pas terrible, on gèle carrément."}
{"text":"I give it an extra star simply for the convenience of usually being able to accommodate larger groups on weekend for brunches without reservation.
It's a pretty wide selection of classic breakfasts with reasonable prices and it's better then most breakfast chains but not extremely innovative either."}
{"text":"Perfect location. Beautiful décoration. Right menu but the flavor is laking. Not well seasoned at my taste. Great place for group."}
{"text":"AMAZING.

My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place for brunch after going to the Museum of Fine Arts, and we were not disappointed! We were sat immediately and ordered strawberry mimosas to drink. They were small, but very tasty! We both ordered the crepe and egg combo. I got a plain crepe with strawberries and over easy eggs, and he got a crepe with the works: hazelnut chocolate spread, banana, and strawberries. What we didn't know is these meals also came with toast, breakfast potatoes, and fresh fruit! We were also blown away when our server asked if we wanted freshly cracked pepper for our eggs!

The waitstaff also allowed us to move to a different table when we were getting too hot sitting near the heater. The service was quick, accommodating, and very nice.

Decent prices for the amount of food, and how good the meal was. Overall, a very good experience! If we were ever in the area again, we would definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is DOOOOOOOPE!   Great value, and yummy breakfast all day.   Really nice if you're visiting from the west coast and need breakfast around lunch time.   Staff was super nice, highly recommend."}
{"text":"The place is busy all the time but we didn't wait long for a table for two. Service was prompted and food portion was huge for the price! Free coffee refill was a plus, though the coffee was meh. Will come again."}
{"text":"i find it hard to call one breakfast joint head and shoulders above another.  As long as you get my eggs right and my toast isn't burnt i'm usually a happy camper.  that said we ordered the universel breakfast with french toast, waffles, and crepes.  it was good.  filling.  i liked the real maple syrup that they use.  smoothie was okay.  I think i would pass on it next time."}
{"text":"Une place où l'on se retrouve de temps à autres avec des amis. On est toujours bien reçu et bien servi malgré un peu d'attente selon les jours.

Notre gros péché mignon est la grosse assiette de nachos au fromage qu'on se partage à 3 ou 4. Elle est totalement décadente. On la prend à chaque fois.

Les club sandwiches sont bons. Mais dernièrement j'ai voulu essayer les pâtes.

J'ai donc pris les Fettuccini aux fruits de mer, résultat : 2 grosses crevettes, 4 belles moules et des palourdes et pétoncles en abondance. Avec une sauce tomate vin blanc qui était pas mal bonne. Et le tout accompagné d'une grande tartine grillé à l'ail. Donc dans l'ensemble je me suis régalé. Et ça pour moins de 20$.

Que demande le peuple ? 

Moi j'étais vraiment satisfait, juste 4 étoiles à cause de l'attente les deux dernières fois, sinon c'est vraiment une bonne place."}
{"text":"let me tell you all, please, gather around, please, here, allow me to serve you up a morsel of a story:

i walk in, famished to the bone.
i sit down on a chair, cushy for my tushy.
the waiter comes around, he is grinning, a big smile, a toothy visage of pleasant vibes and laughter. 
i ask-- \"is this., is this 'break fast pizza,' truly a pizza?\"
to which he replies: \"yes!\"
i say, \"ha, instead, i will have a 'denver omelette.'\"

listen: the omelette? delicious. the price? even tastier.

i left happier than i previously thought possible."}
{"text":"An OK brunch place. Ordered their sweet potato omelette and the smoked salmon/goat cheese benny. Tasted alright, not outstanding and a little oily, but not bad.

The hollandaise sauce was delicious. Service was ok. The deco and ambience here were great and very modern."}
{"text":"Very fast service, the food and coffee were delicious. Our waiter was very attentive and checked on us often. My husband ordered a really good juice (le universel) which was also delicious (I took several sips lol). I will definitely come back to this spot on our next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Was here during the bachelor party, woke up earlier than the rest of the crew, decided to take a stroll and grabbed some breakfast near by.  While arrived, we thought, what a nice place to eat on that beautiful day.  When the food came out, it was was only mediocre.  Tasted like your basic Benedict, nothing special.  Although not a bad place to grab breakfast, but certainly not the worth it to go out the way for."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. When we got there, there was a line out the door, but they got it cleared out right away and we had a table in less than 5 minutes. 

We were taken care of quickly. Most of the staff seemed to speak both English and French. I got the breakfast combo (can't remember the exact name) and I feel it was a very good value. The food was great and we definitely got our money's worth, for it being in downtown montreal. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you have gluten issues. We were seated rather quickly and started to peruse our menu. When the waiter came over to ask us if we were ready (in French) I could sense his annoyance with the fact that we did not speak French. His annoyance became apparent when he ignored us to tend to another table(French speakers) which was seated after us. He brought them all their coffee while forgetting about the drinks we ordered. I had to ask the person who brought me my food if I could have my coffee and my daughter could have her chocolate milk. We didn't see the waiter again until he brought me my bill.  I would not recommend this place and in fact would send you over to Ben and Florentine one block over."}
{"text":"Well, simply amazing! The service was personal, and our server Jimmy was funny, informative and attentive. 

The food was served fast, hot, fresh and cooked to perfection. Everything was just perfect! 

The decor was unique with glass globe style lighting on the ceiling. The wallpaper was of a 3 dimensional fabric, very cool design and earthy green color. The atmosphere was fun, friendly and vibrant. 

Overall, a favorite breakfast place of mine to visit when in Montreal.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice brunch with my daughter. She had a well-crafted healthy egg omelet and I had a not so healthy eggs benedict. Food was very good, with a lovely side of fruit. Potatoes were scrumptious. Place had a waiting line at noon."}
{"text":"Went there a few days ago.

The menu is huge, with a lunch and a brunch menu operating at the same time. I ordered the usual Egg benedict, Bacon, sausage and mushroom topped with hollandaise. The potatoes were just right, crispy, starchy goodness. The hollandaise could have been a tad warmer, but the eggs and the bread were perfect.

 While the food is very tasty and makes great hangover food, it's nothing innovative, its solid diner fair. It's kinda pricey tho, so take this into account. Great location for a quick lunch.

Oh, and the service was amazingly attentive. The waiting staff gave all they could to offer proper service to everyone. Kudos to them."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot. Came here for breakfast. It was packed!! Food came out quick and was tasty. Had the eggs benny. The hollandaise was amazing.

Would come back again in a heartbeat. Biggest positive was the speed service. To the point and friendly."}
{"text":"Je cherchais un endroit tranquille, pas trop cher (-de 15$) et où la nourriture est bonne. Et en plus pas trop loin de chez moi. Et j'avoue qu'avec tous ces critères, c'était pas gagné! Une amie m'a conseillé Universel, me disant que c'était le meilleur rapport qualité prix de Montréal. Bon. Tentons.
Et effectivement, je dois dire que malgré mes exigences, je n'ai pas été déçue!
Déjà l'endroit est très classe. Des couleurs chaleureuses lui donnent un petit côté douillet et moderne à la fois. On s'y sent dans un endroit chic mais tout de même accessible aux communs des mortels.
Côté accueil, rien à redire. Un charmant jeune homme nous reçoit tout sourire, et ce malgré notre retard et nous dirige vers notre table où une serveuse a-do-ra-ble vient prendre le relais. Elle est souriante elle aussi, mais également très attentionnée et tout en même temps discrète : une vraie perle!
Ensuite nous avons commandé et mon amie et moi avons toutes les deux opté pour un brunch, même si nous étions en semaine. Et personne n'a trouvé à redire à cela.  Moi j'ai demandé le combo 2 ufs et 2 crêpes avec un assortiment fraises bananes. Déjà grosse bonne surprise en voyant arriver mon assiette qui contenait également des patates, 3 autre tranches de fruits, et des toasts avec confiture, beurre de peanuts, etc. Et il y avait aussi du sirop d'érable qui était inclus et offert en pichet ce qui est suffisamment généreux pour être remarqué! 
Et pour finir, je dirai qu'en plus de tous ces bons points déjà acquis (déco chic, service nickel, portions généreuses, prix parfaits), Universel a fini de me conquérir dès que j'ai entamé ma première bouchée : c'était très bon!"}
{"text":"The food was good, ambiance was great, staff super friendly! I'd like to visit them for brunch.... we stopped in for supper."}
{"text":"We stopped this cute spot as Yelp reviews raved about it, it was the best decision. The servers were pleasant and the food was great. If I come back to Montreal I'm coming back here for their awesome breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Insanely good. Portion size was great and it didn't sacrifice quality to get it there. Our whole table got different versions of the eggs benedict and we're all amazed. This is the place to be for breakfast/brunch"}
{"text":"We ate here this morning (Sunday)at around 9:30am. It was raining and this happened to be around the corner from where we are staying. The hostess greeted and seated us right away. I ordered the oatmeal and my husband had the plain Belgian waffles. The food was brought out by our server pretty quickly. My only complaint, which I brought to the attention of our server was that while the oatmeal was good, the walnuts must have been old and ruined the flavor of the dish. I ate around them as best as I could.  In retrospect I should have sent it back and ordered something else. I recommended to the server that she pass on my observation about the walnuts...not sure if that will be addressed or not. We were not rushed out...plenty of empty tables..."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch! Fresh fruit, and fresh fruit smoothies were terrific. Outside eating area right on Peel. Eggs Benedict and waffles with hazelnut chocolate were scrumptious."}
{"text":"Simply the best brunch ever! Had exquisite French toasts with strawberries, eggs, bacon, roasted potatoes and fruit, coffee is included and also cream, jam, peanut butter and honey! I'll surely go back there when in Montreal!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely brunch here. Being Sunday late morning, they were crazy busy. With that said, they got us in right away and hustled to get everyone served quickly. We sat in an outdoor area which was covered, so it was warm. The food was good and serving size was massive. I ordered eggs Benedict and held the cheese, but added mushrooms. Yum!! It was served with some delicious breakfast fries and a huge bowl of fruit. The one downfall was the eggs were cooked all the way through, so there was no runny yolk. I'm not a local, so maybe that's how this dish would be served throughout the region?!? Regardless, you should check this place out!"}
{"text":"My partner and I went here for our last breakfast in Montreal and we have to say, their omelettes are fantastic!! We were sure where their coffees were from but it was great also. I'd recommend sitting in the outside area because it is beautiful. They kept it cozy and warm for the winter."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast universal!!!!! It was perfection!!!!

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"}
{"text":"Bon quand on recherche un brunch classique ! Par contre, 20mn de file un dimanche midi... c'est long !! 
Un peu cher malgré tout, en particulier le jus d'orange !!"}
{"text":"Let me set the scene... It a Saturday morning, the second day of spring, there is a blizzard outside, and of all weekends... we choose this one to have a girls only romp in Montreal.
But we are troopers... and did I mention hungry? 

We find a restaurant that catches our attention 11 minutes from where we are staying and begin our trek in the snow storm. Wet and cold we arrive and are blown away by the gem we found. Quaint and sophisticated, Universel is not your boring breakfast spot. House music plays in the background, MuchVibe on the TVs and the decor is mix of retro chic, and modern. The breakfast menu is HUGE, service is amazing, and the food came out in less than 10 minutes (which is good cause we were starving).

All in all amazing breakfast vibe.
I would make this my regular spot if I lived here.
Prices are a little higher than a Cora's but well worth the price. 

If you find yourself in MTL in a snowstorm and feel your day has been ruined with ever additional flake, this place will warm your belly and your soul."}
{"text":"Ok food. Ok service. Nothing to rave about. Everyone else in the place was having a late brunch. We were having lunch. The locals obviously know how to roll here, while we were just looking for authentic Canadian cuisine. Errors with our order and the service was painfully slow for us. Yet those who came later were served first. Maybe I had low blood sugar, but I found the mistakes and poor service irritating. 
     My Caesar salad was disgustingly overdressed, my side Pita grilled, while my wife's side Pita was not. They forgot to put feta cheese on her Greek salad, and I think our order was lost in the wind for about half an hour. When the bill came, it was wrong and needed to be corrected. Just too many glitches."}
{"text":"Delicious and consistent every time. If you happen to get there late morning and don't feel like breakfast ask for the lunch menu and they'll be happy to oblige."}
{"text":"This place's food is just as good as the last location I reviewed on Rue Peel. The decor is also spot-on. Although surrounded by some places that pale in comparison to it, the interior is airy, bright, and almost whimsical. Breakfast was delicious, the service was great, even though the tables were pretty close together."}
{"text":"Voilà notre brunch de référence du dimanche!! Près du métro Sherbrooke sur St Denis, très accessible, mais il faut se préparer à patienter un peu. Pas plus de 15 minutes en général, mais si nous sommes en groupe il faut attendre d'être au complet. Il y a des grandes tables on peux donc y aller nombreux! (l'attente sera certainement plus longue dans ce cas là j'imagine)
Nous y allons toujours pour l'heure du déjeuner mais ils servent aussi à dîner et à souper.
Les lait frappés et les jus de fruits frais sont divins, les assiettes déjeuner sont énormes, le bacon croustillant (soooo important) et les oeufs bénédictines sont délicieux!! J'adore!!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast at breakfast and breakfast at lunch. I ate here twice in the week I was visiting Montreal and had breakfast food both times. Delicious crepes, Belgian waffles with strawberries/whipped cream/almonds, potatoes, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. The lunch items I saw look great also. Large menu with so many tempting options. 

We got in without a reservation on weekdays with no issues."}
{"text":"We were staying at a hotel nearby so this was a nice, quick easy walk for us for breakfast. I love that there is covered outdoor seating and that's where we chose to sit - I didn't visit the interior but I'm guessing that it's also welcoming and comfortable. We had a pretty standard breakfast of eggs, bacon, egg sandwich, pancakes and french toast. I think everything was very decent but not remarkable. They were very busy on this Friday morning and I don't know if maybe they don't do refills on coffee, but I sure could have used that myself. I also would have loved to have my egg sandwich on a croissant or something - my brown bread was somewhat dry/stale. Very serviceable, however, and again, very convenient if you're downtown."}
{"text":"Very pleased with this place, an easy walk around the corner from Le Cantlie Suites Hotel where I was staying on Sherbooke St West. Large menu for breakfast,lunch and dinner and reasonably priced for the area. Great service, patio and decor. Loved the individual seafood pizza! fairly thin, non greasy crust! Also the sausage, brie and gruyere omelet was delicious for breakfast; light,fluffy, non greasy."}
{"text":"I came here twice on my Montréal trip. The food is delicious and seasoned just right. Perhaps a tad too much salt on my home fries. 

The decor is big, bright, and happy, just what breakfast restaurants should be like! Their portions are huge. Seating is a bit squishy but totally doable. 

I got the 2 eggs, 3 bacon, 3 sausages thing which came with coffee/tea, fruits, and toast. All that for $11.95+tax! It was a sweet deal. Free refills for coffee and tea too. 

I'd definitely recommend coming here if you're in downtown Montréal. They are ridiculously busy in the morning throughout the week, but you can usually find a seat in 5 min.

1 star deduction was for in I'm personable service by our server the second time we went. I think it's because his English wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Breakfast is a very important meal. It sets the tone for the day. If you start your day here I guarantee you will be starting your day on a great foot. 

The food is very satisfying and well prepared. Atmosphere very relaxed and conducive for waking up in the morning. And the service was spot on. 

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Mushroom and Goat Cheese Eggs Benedict was seriously amazing the first time I tried it but the next time I went back for brunch and got the same thing, nothing was great. There were small pieces of egg shells in my eggs benny and the eggs weren't runny at all. The potatoes and fruit weren't as good as the first time I went... Too many good brunch options in Mtl to return."}
{"text":"Must be the best brunch in the city. Great energy!  We have a little bit of a wait, well worth it. I have their eggs Benedict, best ever."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast on a Saturday morning. The vibe is a bit retro with the interior design. The food was okay. Omelette wasn't very flavorful.
Eggs Benedict was okay. Fruit as fresh and flavorful. Homefries were good. Latte was good as well."}
{"text":"I was taking a leisurely stroll down a popular street in Montreal looking for a good restaurant when it started raining. Hard. I needed to take cover in the next available eatery and thank my lucky stars it was Universel. It was as if the Canadian food gods heard my cry for shelter and put Universel in my path as a gesture of hospitality.

The portion sizes here are abundant and the food rings more classic breakfast than bourgeois brunch. Plates come loaded with bacon, home fries, eggs or whatever else it is that you order. I had the Universel omelet which comes with the works (bacon, sausage, ham, red onions, green peppers, mushrooms and cheddar cheese). I got it with a hearty side of home fries and whole wheat toast. I also ordered the L'univers smoothie which comes with strawberries, banana, blueberries, melon, kiwi, honey and orange.

Other menu items that looked absolutely delicious: The waffles, crepes and the many varieties of eggs benedict -- all served with either gruyère or goat cheese."}
{"text":"Such a nice affordable place to get breakfast/brunch. I had no complaints and the food is really affordable. My husband and I both got the Mexican burrito breakfast. Delicious. Service is very quick as well. The place was PACKED when we got there so I was surprised how quickly they sat us down. Would definitely come here again if in town."}
{"text":"So good, we returned twice in one weekend!

I'd heard about Universel from a couple of Yelpers so we planned to stop in for breakfast on our trip to Montreal. But we loved it so much the first time, we decided to stop in again 2 days later!

On our first visit, we had a very late lunch after driving down from Mont Tremblant. They've got a very large menu with so many diverse choices. I opted for the Tortellini Gigi with 3 cheeses as it sounded quite hearty. It ended up being a great choice! Stuffed with 3 cheeses and soaked in a creamy tomato sauce and topped with mushrooms, every bite was oh so good!

On the second visit, we stopped in for a late breakfast. I was torn between sweet and hearty as I wanted the energy of protein but sweet things like french toast and crepes were calling my name. I read up and down the crepe options and saw a few with protein. I opted for the bacon, apple, and cheddar crepes which quite honestly seemed like an odd combination. The crepes came out a tad on the thick side but it didn't matter because they were so good. The cheddar, apple, and bacon combination was delicious! I scarfed every bit down!

Service was friendly on both visits and the warm atmosphere was a nice break from the cold. The decor is hip and contemporary with lots of green, mirrored surfaces, and large booths. It's a great place to host a large group with plentiful space. 

The great reviews bestowed upon Universel are well deserved. It was a huge hit for us.....twice! It's must do, at least once, on your Montreal visit."}
{"text":"I will definitely be coming back! Staff was wonderful & well mannered even though the lady who seated us seemed a bit snotty. We were seated in the heated area.. but the heat was a bit much since it was blowing right on us. But it wasn't terrible. Food was great."}
{"text":"Great food..nice ambiance..good service
awesome crepes would say best so far.
even after the huge wait outside did not have to wait for long.
they have big space both inside and outside.
a recommended place for all visitors"}
{"text":"I really do not see what the hype about this place is all about. Universal is your typical chain restaurant that serves brunch, lunch and dinner. The food is not bad but it is not good either. 

I've tried their brunches (eggs benedicts) before as well as their lunches (mussels) and I must say its just very very plain and ordinary and for the price you are paying ($15-20), there are so much more better options out there. The only bright side of this place is the amount of food they give you."}
{"text":"Got the fruit crepe. So amazing, I wished I could eat 2. Will definitely come back if I ever get back to Montreal."}
{"text":"Another great place for breakfast in downtown Montreal. Very good portions and free wifi. Service also great."}
{"text":"Spectacular House Special Eggs Benedict. Perhaps the best I've had. Wonderful and friendly service. Fresh and gorgeous juice drinks. Completely worth the slight wait for a table."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best brunches I have ever had. Long story short: great service, food was fast and delicious, they catered to a few minor changes in the dish, and overall absolutely worth it.

I had the classic eggs benedict with ham substituting the default cheese to goat cheese. It came out loaded with hollandaise sauce, with some fresh fruit and house fries (see posted pictures from other users). I crushed all of it, while my girlfriend only had half of her eggs bene with salmon and spinach - not because of taste, but rather it was so filling. 

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place for good quality breakfast.. Service is great and the price is reasonable.... My 3rd time to go there for breakfast and I will go back again...
Check it out for yourself :)"}
{"text":"This place was great. Coffee was the best I've ever had. Service was beyond friendly. Food was great. Very reasonable prices for the quality and amount of food. 

My wife had the crepe which was ridiculous in size but she loved it. Very sweet so she didn't finish it all but she enjoyed every bite she had of it.

The breakfast pizza was so much better than it's name. Perfectly baked with a side of home fries that were outstanding. 

Hope to return here soon."}
{"text":"This is was my last brunch in Montreal before I left and it was everything I wanted it to be. Let me set the scene: Montreal was getting its first snow storm of the season, it had been snowing for a few hours and the streets were totally out of a winter wonderland. Anyway, we popped in for a quick bite because we wanted to leave before the snow got really bad. Not only was the food very fast and the service very welcoming, the food was fantastic. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I love a great breakfast and this place didn't deliver. The service was fine, but the food was just terrible. I had an healthy egg white omelette that had peppers, spinach, and sweet potato. The sweet potato was likely boiled beforehand. I would've liked it to have been cooked on the grill. The ingredients of everything (including the bread) was store quality, not restaurant quality. Basically everything tastes like they came out of a jar, a can, or a bag. Example: picture of the jams.

My husband had the universel plate- the creton was very average and not flavorful, and the crepes tasted terrible, and the syrup did not help at all. His pumpernickel toast was burnt. Go to L'avenue or somewhere else for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Oh man, this place was great.

Talk about a filling breakfast! I was not expecting the amount of food I received, and everything was delicious. The place was packed to the gills, but we only had to wait 5 or so minutes to get a table on a Saturday morning.

I couldn't recommend this place more highly."}
{"text":"Try the Universal egg benedict if you are feeling tough. Really tasty with sausage and sauce. Would recommend also mimosa on Sunday brunch. Service is always surprisingly prompt. Plate comes out in less than 3 minutes, incredible. Friendly staff as well, a plateau classic."}
{"text":"we went on a sunday morning and had an amazing breakfast. the waitress was very nice and the coffee here was probably the best Ive had in a long while. i had the Universel Breakfast which came with SO much food, and my bf got the french toast with bananas/strawberries, which was also huge portion and yum. neither of us could finish our food but agreed that this place was a great find. total before tip came to about $35. if you are looking for quality and quantity, come here! great music playing as well."}
{"text":"There is definitely no wow factor in this restaurant!

Everything about this place is middle of the road. The food we ordered was far from being creative, and the service was certainly not attentive. I really hate having to chase after my waitress for a coffee refill. At least come and check on me every 15 minutes or so. Please!

But being middle of the road means that it wasn't horrible. I'll probably return one day. My friend works across the street. 

PS: am I the only person who worries about writing mediocre reviews to restaurants that I go to? LOL."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the look of the restaurant more than I did the food. I certainly wouldn't rank this place up there with places like L'avenue. I am totally shocked that the average rating is 4.5 stars. It's just an average breakfast restaurant. I don't know what else to call it.

The place is very nice, and I found the staff to be very friendly as well.

Lucky me... I got to sit in the chair closest to the bathrooms. When the high powered hand dryers were going off, you would swear a 747 was taking off! But hey... Somebody has to sit in the worst chair. Why not me;)"}
{"text":"Delicious!!  Classic Eggs Benedict was spot on!  Quick friendly service.  And was very close to le st Martin hotel."}
{"text":"There really is nothing not to like about this place. I was in Montreal with friends celebrating the end of bachelorhood for one of the poor saps. While walking around the streets of St. Catherine and Crescent looking for pre-festivity alcohol, we mentally took note of restaurants that would make for good dinner accommodations. Lucky for us and the wait staff at Cafe Universel, this restaurant was a block away from our hotel, Omni Mont Royal on Sherbrooke. 

Food: All 8 of us agreed, the food was tasty, hearty and apportioned generously. 
Service: A bit slow, but if it took them time to cook a great meal with hearty ingredients then we can wait. The pre dinner drinks helped pass the time. Also, our waiter, Ricki, was top notch. Not the easiest thing serving 8 rowdy guys at a bachelor/stag party. Ricki did so with a smile (and an accent).
Decor: It drew us into the restuarant. Think unpretentious modern chic - and no, i dont know what that means. 
Price: Totally reasonable. They had 2 for 1 drink specials and entrees were $10 - $20 (closer to $10 than $20). 

I would absolutely go back here the next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Love coming here for breakfast! Their menu is a little overwhelming as it is pretty expansive, however everything I have had (usually omelettes) are very yummy. Make sure to make a reservation because it is packed come brunch time on Saturday!"}
{"text":"Never really considered myself a brunch addict but somehow always end up having brunch. This has led me again to end up to another brunch place: Universel. Located in a prime location in the middle of downtown Montreal, it caters to different populations: from tourists to local office workers. That means also that the restaurant might get pretty crowded at any given day in the week. I went there around 12pm on a Wednesday and was able to be seated right away. 

The decor of the restaurant is appealing and looks modern. The service was also good. Now let's get to the real material: the food. I decided on the Universel brunch, which was pretty standard, consisting of 2 eggs, beans, crouton, toasts, potatoes and a choice between pain doré, crepes or waffles. I decided to go for the pain doré (no real reason why though). The plate costed 15$ before taxes and tips, which sums to about 19.50-20$ after both taxes and tips. The portion was generous, but I would say that I was the only good point of the meal. The pain doré were average at best. The potatoes were decent but their flavour had nothing exciting. Worst part was definitively the fruit which were stale and dry, depleted of any flavour. 

Unfortunately, I could not recommend this restaurant to others as I have experienced MUCH better brunches in Montreal. However, I guess of you are in a rush and looking for quick brunch fix, this place might cut up. But beware, it might leave you with the feeling of wanting more."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. The service was kind and fast. Veggie omelet came with potatoes and bread. The omelet was perfect and fresh. I highly recommend this place. Sit by the window!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast and lunch.

We've been seated on the covered heated terrace - great winter solution. 

I've ordered Egg Benedict with salmon and my wife took omelette with Bree. Egg Benedict came on a fat bagel with half plate of potatoes and a separate bowl of fruits. Omelette was accompanied by 4 toasts and a slice of pineapple. Daughter was the only one who got exactly what she ordered - crepes with bananas and hazelnut chocolate. So next time there we'd probably order one dish for two.

Everything we ordered was pretty good. Latte wasn't superior, but good enough to be taken without sugar.

Good location - right on our way to Mount Royal."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot!! We came here twice during our 4-day trip to Montreal. The menu was huge so there is a lot to choose from and everything we tried was very yummy. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for brunch, each time ordering their eggs Benedict. Nicely plated, and every element is prepared well (i.e. soft boiled eggs, nice Hollandaise, still crispy English muffin). Prices are surprisingly good for the quality and amount of food you get (approx. $15), love how close it is to McGill as well."}
{"text":"Disappointed twice- the food presentation was good at least. The first time I visited this place it was very busy and I found hair in my food. The waitress apologized and only brought me a new plate. I forgot I ate at this place and a year later the reviews brought me back. The waitress did not know how to pour coffee. She left drops all over my side of the table and I had to wipe it myself both times....the food came, it looked appetizing (I ordered the salmon eggs benny) the hollandaise sauce was basic and everything else was pretty basic and not worth the price. Tot-ou-tard on cherrier does it way better. Sorry, I really wanted to like this place given how the set up and establishment looks decent and professional."}
{"text":"A very airy and spacious restaurant. The bathrooms are super posh and nice! I made reservations but it wasn't too packed when my friends and I arrived. I loved the universel eggs benedict and iced cappuccino I ordered. The waitress was prompt and friendly despite the restaurant filling up quite quickly. Definitely a brunch place worthy of Sex and the City brunch and gossip level!"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict were fantastic. The breakfast poutine also delicious. I ordered both, but either was more than enough. I'd order the poutine by itself for a nice filling breakfast. Service was good, it was Saturday morning so it was packed, but they do a quick turnaround so no waiting."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon déjeuner au Universel!
La gaufre dans mon assiette était divine!
Le personnel est sympathique. 
La localisation sur St-Denis est parfaite. 
J'y retournerai certainement bientôt!"}
{"text":"So, third time a charm? Nope!  This time I decided to go early, at 7:30 AM. Only three other guests were there. My server was great. However, when I got my Eggs Benedict,  the yoke was completely cooked. When I asked another server if they could redo the order because my egg yoke was cooked, she asked \"do you want them runny?\" I was kind of surprised at this question since having a runny yoke is how it is supposed to be prepared! Anyway, I decided to give them another try. Oddly, they always seem to disappoint more as time passes. I'm not giving them another try again!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast after reading the reviews, and it was pretty darn good. Like I usually do, I had the Eggs Benedict. The eggs were just a tad bit overcooked, but not so severe that it took away from the taste. The sauce was nice as well, but not too rich or thick (which I usually prefer). As far as the potatoes, I thought they were a little heavy, but they did have a nice taste. The staff was friendly as well, from the server to the manager. The place is nice inside, but limited space in some places. If you are in the area and need a breakfast, I would recommend Universel."}
{"text":"Excellent Breakfast!Great service and lots of food that is really good!Easy walking distance from the downtown area hotel."}
{"text":"OMG! You HAVE to try the Calamari! It is the best Calamari I have ever tried! The wait staff is nice and the atmosphere is laid back and peaceful. I ordered the French Onion Soup only and it was delish!

Definitely a nice place to stop and have lunch or a snack after shopping!"}
{"text":"Un brunch correct dans la globalité. Peu cher et avec de bonnes proportions! Saucisse et pommes de terre étaient bons, en revanche les pains dorés n'étaient pas très moelleux. C'est une bonne place pour un brunch classique peu dispendieux."}
{"text":"Exploring Montreal with the boyfriend, and we ended up here for lunch.  They had nacho's on their menu, and I can never say no to nacho's.  To be honest, they were only okay, not that impressive.  Boyfriend got a veggie burger, and I believe he ate it all, so it must have been good.  The atmosphere was nice and the service was good.  Lots of English speaking which made me feel comfortable and at home.  3 overall because like it says, \"a-ok.\""}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place has the rating it has...
There was about a 30min wait at noon for 3 people.
We sat at the bar for coffee, which was amazing.  As all the servers passed the food looked amazing!

That was short lived.  

I ordered the ham and cheese crepe.  First of all, this was the most dense crepe, it was more like a stuffed pancake....
My friend had a grilled cheese sandwich and salmon egges beni.
Immediately when the grilled cheese came I knew it was going to be bad. The cheese wasnt even melted....
The salmon eggs beni was salty and terrible....

This probably is a tourist spot, music is loud, decor is nice, its in the city.....if i lived in montreal i would never go here...."}
{"text":"Clean, bright friendly service and open air on a nice day. This pale was about $12 USD-- a steal. My first time to try creton and it was good. Huge plate, large variety and quality taste. Coffee was not the best but a small it own compared to envy thing else. Definitely worth finding"}
{"text":"We went here to fill up on breakfast before heading up Mont Royal and it was a perfect choice. They have so many breakfast options and so many different combination plates to choose from. I always love a breakfast places that can give you plates with many different types of food on them! The price was reasonable and we enjoyed all of the food here! There's lots of seating inside and outside so you shouldn't need a reservation (it was 10-11 when we showed up and they took us right away). The service was great too!"}
{"text":"My friend and I loved this place so much that we went there twice for brunch on a weekend getaway to Montreal. Man the place gets packed but service was always friendly and prompt. The food options are reasonable priced, plentiful and varied (I had a crepe and eggs benedict) but everything I tasted were delicious (shot out to the amazing homefries). Also... the delicious brunch cocktails..... yes. yes. yes."}
{"text":"Overall great brunch! My girlfriend and I love finding good brunch places, and this place definitely met our expectations. 

I got the Universal Omelette and my girlfriend got the Vegetarian Omelette with sausage. It came with a side of fruit, home fries (\"best home fries\" my girlfriends ever eaten) and toast. Very tasty and filling. Coffee was excellent as well.

Restaurant was trendy and we walked right in (no long wait). Service was decent, but they forgot my girlfriends croissant. Tables are very close to each other. Slightly loud environment. But hey, that's brunch!

We would definitely recommend and come back again."}
{"text":"I ate a decent bacon Benny at this funky little breakfast spot today. I came in at 11:30 there was plenty of seating, friendly server and my food was good and served quickly, shockingly so. The food reminded me of Cora but the atmosphere was much more upscale. I'm a self proclaimed Benny connoisseur, so I can't give it five stars, but it was good, and I was hungry. Hollandaise is not 'classic' but it fit the bill."}
{"text":"My first time to Montreal and we arrived a bit late so our dinner options were limited.   So glad we made it here in time to have our meal.

We opted for the lasagna with spinach and meat sauce.  I have to say, it was one of the best entrees we have ever experienced!   The sauce was seasoned perfectly with a hint of a spice I will have to let you experience yourself to enjoy!   

Stop in either of their locations for a meal you'll sure to enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place was great.  The brunch was delicious.  The service was friendly.  Almost at the heart of downtown.  I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"After an epic walk from our B&B then up and down Mount Royal we wanted something close by. I yelped for restaurants and this one sounded good. We sat at the bar and our waiter could not have been more attentive. Gave us plenty of time to look through the menu while keeping our water glasses filled. He made beer recommendations to my friend and was on top of anything we needed. Excellent service!  

Then there was the food. Wonderful!  My friend ordered an appetizer of escargot in a cream sauce with some fresh rolls that was amazing. I wasn't thrilled at the idea of snails but this was terrific. The cream sauce was amazing. I had a roast beef sandwich on a baguette with coarse mustard and onion confit, lettuce and tomato. This came with a side salad, I ordered the house, with an incredibly delicious dressing. My buddy ordered a salmon tartare that was somehow mixed with avocado and subtle amounts of onion and a balsamic drizzle over the whole thing. It was served with crostini. If I was a permanent resident of Montreal I'd eat here often."}
{"text":"I've come here twice. The first time I had quite the unpleasant experience. There was a sign at the door saying they cannot seat you until everyone has arrived. Granted it was very busy that day, so I respected this and sat at the door. Then I realized none of the servers would even look at me, which I found very rude. Had I not already told my friends to meet me here, I would've left immediately. Needless to say this restaurant gave me a terrible first impression. I also found the service after we were seated to be slow and disorganized. 

The second time I was here because another friend really likes this place. The food is quite good. The space is big so it's good for large groups because there isn't much of a wait time. It's a good place to eat brunch if you don't want to go far (from downtown core) or if you have no other ideas."}
{"text":"Delicious French toast! The Universel Breakfast is a great deal (french toast/waffle + 2 eggs + sausages/bacon/ham + creton + toast + fruits + coffee/tea) with huge portions. I split it with a friend and I was still full! (Can't believe I usually try to eat the whole thing myself). Came up to ~$10/person with tax and tip. Potatoes were well-seasoned as expected of Universel but mine were a little oily today. There was around a 10 minute wait this Saturday morning and it took a while for a waiter to get our order but the food came really quickly. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Amazing staff! Great food. All of my group was very happy with their breakfast. Highly recommend the eggs benedict dishes and the omelettes. Beautifully prepared. Manager came to my group on more than one occasion to make sure our group was content. 
Very English friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant pour bruncher!!!! Les plats sont copieux. L'endroit est très décontracté mais le service est parfois un peu brut."}
{"text":"This restaurant has one of the most respectable and professional staff I have ever seen! They make southern hospitality look weak. They know how to make a mean breakfast. I grabbed the sampler because I wanted to try everything. I can tell you this, it's worth every dollar. Highly recommended. It will be a place I without question will return when I am back in Montreal."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT BREAKFAST!! The portions are generous and more importantly the food is fresh and delicious! I've never had breakfast sausages that were never frozen. The potatoes were cooked perfectly and had so much flavor. The crepes were very good as well. Coffee was good and not too hot. Place gets crowded so adjust your time."}
{"text":"Honestly the place is above 4 stars IMO, I don't know of many breakfast places in all of Canada that handle this kind of volume and maintain a reasonably high level of food quality

Great breakfast items, huge fresh fruit selection, fantastic smoothies to go with your loaded breakfast.  Skip the coffee because Castel is across the street."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast spots I've eaten in Montreal. Menu was vast and they even have a kids menu. Prices aren't bad considering the portions. Atmosphere is cool especially with the patio door open during the summer time. I had the universel breakfast with crepes and it was yummy including the beans! Kids loved their meals as well. Service wasn't bad considering how busy they were. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Food was good, healthy portion of fruit on the plate. Both me and my girlfriend had the universal Benedict. Service was quick and efficient. Definitely recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Everything was bad from the moment we walked in the door and the manager with the French attitude comes over to tell us there's a wait. All the way up until never being able to get a refill of water, and waiting 18 minutes for my iced coffee. Horrible service below average food. Go to other local spots."}
{"text":"I went their recently with my colleagues, and I found the food decent, the prices ok. I think the service is lacking since they place is so PACKED with customers. We went at lunch (with explains the rush), but I feel that the restaurant was great.

I haven't been there for breakfast, but I would like to!"}
{"text":"Brilliant brunch place, conveniently located and worth every bit of it. 

We have been going to this place ever so often and it is one of the best brunches I have had in town. You would get spoilt by choice here, though I suggest the eggs benedict (personally think its the best on their menu). 
The service is great, and the waiters are extremely friendly. If you happen to go there during happy hours and want to order some appetizers, just go with the nachos (big portions and oh oh so yummy). 

Definitely recommend this place to everyone, and if you are getting the French toast- get the chocolate strawberry one- it has powers that can make turn any bad day into a good day."}
{"text":"Ça faisait un bout que je voulais essayer Universel, tant que j'en entendais parler. Et avec raison! Belle place qui spécialise dans le brunch et sait bien faire les patates. (quand même important, non?) De mon côté, j'ai essayé la crêpe aux pommes, bacon et cheddar. Assez intense, et pas mal goûteux. En plus d'être bien cuite avec les ingrédients bien balancés, elle était accompagnée de leurs patates signatures. Miam! En plus d'un menu fiable, leur staff est très bien choisi. Les serveurs sont attentionnés, amicables, et vont au-delà de ce qui est attendu dans le cadre de la restaurantion. Ils sont rapides à se faire ami et cherchent le sourire de leurs clients. 

J'aime bien."}
{"text":"Great food there . Love the waffle. Great amount for breakfast, ate it for lunch though. The environment there is pretty good"}
{"text":"Great prices, great portions, great food! Wait staff was very helpful and attentive. Definitely recommend if everyone in your group can't agree on a place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and portion sizes enormous . We tried the breakfast poutine and loved it .. also fresh fruit smoothies are highly recommended .. just get them straight thou , barely tasted the shot of rum I added on . Paid Parking is available on the streets and customer service was great !"}
{"text":"Wonderful free-flowing coffee
Delicious Universel omelet with tasty home fries and pumpernickel toast.
Sensible berry smoothie for \"desert\".
Very nice atmosphere and good food convenient to downtown Marriott."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Montreal I feel like I gain so much weight, most of it comes from my splurging at this Café. It's a mod little café that tourists like myself would easily pass by and go to something more recognizable. Fortunately, I was dragged here on my first trip to Montreal by my chef friend and I fell in love. It's been consistently delicious, and has yet to let me not want to gorge myself until my stomach explodes. My advice is to go for breakfast but be prepared to wait a little. Their breakfast food is fantastic and comes in massive portions. Every dish is served with roasted potatoes and a beautifully decorated fruit cup. 

This past time I went, I ordered the Universel Benedict which is essentially a normal eggs benedict on meat steroids. It had bacon and sausage, served on a bagel with sautéed mushrooms, and the usual poached egg in hollandaise. I don't even need to tell you it was good. The egg was poached perfectly with the warm runny yolk. I'm drooling thinking about it. I also managed to order a strawberry, banana, and chocolate crepe. When it came out it looked like it should've had a choir singing with it. Universel didn't skimp on the ingredients, this crepe was packed full and smothered in Nutella and chocolate. Despite having finished my benedict I managed to eat half of this crepe. Yes, I am a fatty. The few times I've gone, I've only gone for breakfast but this past time I caught a glimpse of their burger and impulsively wanted to dive head first into it. They look good, I'll give them that much.

 All in all, a spectacular place. I tend to go here and eat until I want to puke and then try to fit some more in. The prices aren't obscene but it's not cheap either. I mean, you get what you pay for. If you go on a busy day like Saturday or Sunday for brunch do be prepared to wait. They are incredibly popular with the locals, and popular with the culinary students of ITHQ located in front of the café (that must be a good sign)."}
{"text":"Went here on my mini vacation to Montreal.  The service here was great... The food.. Even better!!  Every dish comes with a little bit of fruit which was nice! The home fries are something I don't normally eat because it's \"filler\" food but they were amazing!! I ate them first haha.  Over all great spot... Nice prices.. Amazing food!"}
{"text":"Everytime full after brunch, the crepe is soft. I ordered universel dejeuner combo with three meet and universel smoothie, large quantity, I can not finish them all,costs around 27dollar in total. A little pricy."}
{"text":"Ate here in July. I had been looking forward to having brunch here after reading all the good reviews, but I was sorely disappointed.

Food:
I had the French crepe with the assorted fruits and custard. First of all, I should have sent it back as soon as I stuck my fork in it. I have never sent back food, so I was hesitant, and kept trying to convince myself that maybe this was a French crepe and I'd been having Americanized French crepes my whole life. But no. There's no denying that I was definitely served some kind of doughy, half a centimeter-thick, tortilla-like wrapping with my fruit. I was really craving a crepe for my last brunch in Montreal, but alas...NO CREPE! The custard was also cloyingly sweet. The fruit was great though. But the whole meal was not worth the $10 or however much I paid for it.

Friend had an okay experience with her omelette, though, so 3 stars.

Atmosphere:
It was definitely not what I expected of a \"dejeuner\" place. Dimly lit, bar/lounge-like, and a bit tight. More appetizer and drinks than brunch.

Service:
Pretty average."}
{"text":"The food today was really disappointing. Paid over $20 for bacon that didn't even seem like porc bacon. The fruit was dry and tasted off (not rotten, but like sour and bad). Everything was cold as well. Probably won't come back again after this experience. For the price I expect warm food-- at minimum!"}
{"text":"I was here for brunch two days in a row this weekend. It's a very solid place for a reasonable price. My friends and I got the eggs benny both times-- I tried the asparagus and the spinach. Both were pretty good. I also tried a few bites of the universel eggs benny, which was good but pretty heavy. The bagel went well with the rest of the dish so it would be a great option for someone who needs to eat a little more to be full.

The only part of the meal that wasn't solid was the fruit bowl. Some of the bowl was pretty good-- kiwis and bananas tasted fine. However, the apples and the melon were not fresh. They both tasted weird, and the apples had discolouration along the edges of the skin. If they could have fresher fruit, this would be a 5 star place. Service was good too and my waiter was pretty friendly. I went around noon on Saturday and 9am on Sunday, and did not have to wait for a table at either time."}
{"text":"Man, I went there today and wow!  I personally loved this place...it reminded me of a few cafes back home in Dallas, Tx.  If you're looking for a good breakfast place...go to this place!!!  You won't regret it!!!  :)"}
{"text":"This was quite a nice brunch place to go to mid afternoon.  It had a great selection of dishes. 

The classical eggs and bacon dish was very big and easily fills one up without feeling excessive.

I really enjoyed the creme Anglaise waffles. The English creme was the best I've had in a while and was rich and sweet as opposed to the milky watery type found in most brunch places. The fruits where fresh and plentiful.

Service was great and the overall ambiance was on the louder side. Music plays loudly in the background (mostly pop) coupled with the large room of people talking over one another. I would say it was just quiet enough to not feel the need to feel out your conversation.

The place is regularly packed though I've never had a problem being seated."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  You always get a little fruit on the side, but off season it's just not ripe enough."}
{"text":"It was 3pm and we wanted crepes.  The bacon, cheddar and apple crepe and chocolate and strawberry crepe were delicious.  Excellent table service and good drinks.  We will be back."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Door person messed up on names, 50min wait for a table for two. She saw us, and identified that we were there earlier, but forgot to take our name down. She then made us wait again, while everyone behind us got to go ahead.

AVOID. GO ELSEWHERE."}
{"text":"JJ and I woke up early one day in Montreal to find snow gently beginning to fall, so we stayed close to the hotel for breakfast. We walked into Universel shortly after it opened, so there was no crowding at all. We both got coffee to get us going before settling on what to order. 

I liked the wide variety of eggs Benedict and omelets offered on the menu and it took me a while to decide. I ended up having the smoked salmon benedict, which also came with a cup of fresh fruit and home fries. Everything was really good--the salmon wasn't too fishy, and the home fries were really well-seasoned. 

All in all, this was a great start to the morning--we didn't have to wait for a table, the service was fast, and we ate our fill before heading off to start the day's adventure."}
{"text":"As a brunch person, this place was worth it. 

It was the last morning we were in Montreal so we decided to use the time to explore the area near our B&B before we drove off. We explored McGill, Mount Royal a bit and decided we wanted a decent place to eat. We didn't know the area so well and didn't want to settle for some food place at the university. Thank to Yelp, I found this place nearby with lots of great reviews! I can see why. 

If I was a student at McGill, I feel I'd be coming here for brunch quite a bit! The restaurant was quite busy, and we did not have to wait in line so long. Probably because people were leaving at the time we arrived. 

The portions were big (especially the salads so be prepare if you order one)! So much, we were not able to finish our meal. I really don't suggest eating before coming here. Service was great, despite the business and would definitely recommend it if anybody was looking for a good brunch place :)"}
{"text":"Universel was the last restaurant my travel companion and I stopped in on during our visit to Montreal this weekend before catching the bus back to the airport, and it didn't disappoint! We had our luggage, and they warmly accommodated us even though I am sure we were a hassle.

I ordered the 2 egg combo with banana nutella crepes, and it was AMAZING! The eggs were cooked just right, and they didn't skimp on the filling in the crepes. My best friend had the bacon eggs benedict and said she liked it, but wished it wasn't swimming in the hollandaise sauce. Both came with sides of fruit as well.

The server was friendly and attentive, and the food came super quick. My latte was also pretty good, but I wished it had more espresso and less milk. Overall, this was a great last experience in Montreal, and I highly recommend it for breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"Excellente nourriture, belle présentation, staff sincèrement sympathique, bon décor. Le pichet de mimosa est une aubaine pour une bonne tablée.

Cependant, l'endroit est très bruyant (pas idéal pour les conversations et la gueule de bois...). Le café n'est pas inclus avec tous les déjeuners. Aussi le service était lent au début, quoiqu'il se soit rattrapé."}
{"text":"It's like IHOP or Cora's but the service is slow and negligent. I ask the bartender about a drink I saw him make and answered me with a really rude and arrogant attitude. Not worth the money in my opinion. Go to a smaller local breakfast/brunch spot for better food and service."}
{"text":"Too large of portions, but great good and great ambiance. The strawberry/banana/chocolate crepe was a great accompaniment to the eggs and potatoes I had at brunch."}
{"text":"One of those places where when on vacation you don't have to find another eatery because they have everything you need from great food to great service. 

The seat I had allowed me to look straight into the bar area where the bartender prepared all drinks, fruit bowls and desserts. It was nice to see him cut and prepare fresh fruit for the fruit bowls and cleaned up after himself after every task. So pleased with the cleanliness of the establishment. 

I am very particular and am good for sending something back at least once. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT & IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY THAT!!! 

This is a definite recommend and so happy that I only had to exit the Omni Mont Royal's door on Peel, walk 15 ft and experienced heaven in my mouth. 

BTW, I had the black olive, tomato, red onion and feta omelet which comes with home potatoes,  fresh fruit,  toast, and a cup of tea I added a fresh fruit juice (l'univers) prepared upon order (delish). 

The waiter was attentive and didn't act like it was a bother to speak to me in English. 

Shhhhhh, don't tell I'm on my way over now for breakfast before I hit the road back to the states. #goodeats #mustdo #tryityoulllikeit #dontcheatyourself"}
{"text":"This place receives 5 stars simply for the generosity of its staff. We came in twenty minutes before closing time but were received graciously, with no passive-aggressive sentiment that the kindness was tempered with the sentiment that we should eat and depart as quickly as possible. As an American, I cannot speak to the quality of the poutine, but it's at this spot that I gave it my first try. Got to say, on a frigid evening, it hit the spot and I'm a fan. If you need a place that's warm and welcoming, this is the place."}
{"text":"We dropped in here for a quick lunch before a tour at McGill. It was pretty packed but we got in quickly. 

Service was quick, food was decent. I had the pesto mussels and fries. 

Nothing to write home about but definitely a good spot."}
{"text":"Amazing!! 

Amazing Breakfast ! - quantity, quality, display ....Should be one of the best breakfast in town! 

Servers - are professional and nice 

Environment - centrally location / downtown ...and restaurant is clean and good. 

Opps! - if u r not local and don't speak french ...careful with toilet sign .... I went by mistake to Ladies bathroom ...got confused or perhaps not paying attention .  for men sign is \"H / Hommes\"  :P"}
{"text":"This place was literally a 30-second walk from our hotel, so we had to try it. The portions are really big, so much that you can't finish it all. I ordered the healthy omelette (green bell peppers, onions, sweet potatoes, spinach, and egg whites) with fruit and pumpernickel bread. It was very tasty, but the omelette kind of fell apart, and the fruit wasn't just your typical melons and pineapples for once! My family ordered french toast and blueberry crepes. The crepes were more like flat pancakes that tasted like crepes, but they were still really good. Definitely recommend sitting outside on the patio. We came on a weekday, so there was no wait, but on the weekends get there early, as we walked by the line and it was super long!"}
{"text":"A very nice restaurant. The breakfast food served here is the pinnacle Canadian brunch. The smoked salmon egg Benedict is absolutely excellent and very savory. The goat cheese omelette and the Nutella crepe are both solid choices as well. Be sure to order a nice coffee or freshly-squeezed juice as well."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Montreal for a few years and never experienced this perfectly serviceable little diner. Came for breakfast, ate a bunch of stuff. Nothing to write back to the states about but will certainly service that morning meal itch. And maybe even help with a hangover for the tourists flocking to the city to party."}
{"text":"Great place to have your first meal of the day! Crispy bacon, fluffy and crispy waffles, juicy ham, golden eggs, and flavourful home fries. You really can't go wrong with this tasty descriptions

I've been here on a weekday and weekend when ever im visiting MTL and staying at the downtown core. This place is almost always packed especially on the weekends so arrive early or make reservations. 

The ambiance  and customer service is super nice! You really can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"(Breakfast review) Fast and attentive service. Food quality is above average. Ambience is notable and pleasant. Their are not so many ways to do ham & eggs etc. but this place does it with style, while sticking to the basics."}
{"text":"I went here Thursday March 17th 2016 late evening. I am visiting from Niagara Falls Ontario. I went for dinner and the manager (I believe he was the manager) who welcomed me when I walked into the restaurant, was very friendly! My servers name was Victoria. She had awesome customer service, always smiling and super friendly. My food was amazing and was a big serving size! The price is right and the resturant itself is very nice inside. I highly recommend this location. I was also told you can he breakfast till 4 or 5pm there! :)"}
{"text":"J'ai trouvé que  ma crêpe  aux pommes et patates vraiment succulente .Le  service était bien."}
{"text":"This contemporary diner near the Latin Quarter has all the look and feel of a vintage diner, but the food is anything but. The portions are huge, the prices are way reasonable, and the quality of the food is outstanding. I chose a simple bacon and egg breakfast, and my friend chose the French Toast. Everything we ate was way beyond our expectation, and we couldn't have been happier with our choice.

One area for improvement: the coffee. It kills me when an otherwise great restaurant serves average coffee. Charge another dollar for the coffee and make it great.

Great experience and excellent food."}
{"text":"Had brunch here recently. The portions are huggeeeee. The prices are very reasonable around 10-15$ for most items. The French toast and home fries were very good. My crepes were good too a little heavy though. Service is great except I had to flag down my waiter to ask for an item they forgot but forgivable bc this place here crazy busy. Otherwise all the waitstaff was excellent."}
{"text":"Overall standard Montreal breakfast fare, though delicious standard Montreal breakfast fare, served in a restaurant that straddles a diner atmosphere and a more upscale brunch establishment.  I ordered the eggs Benedict, whereas my girlfriend ordered the banana-strawberry-chocolate crêpe.    Savory hollandaise sauce, crispy English muffins, tasty ham, and good potatoes, as well as a (generous) bowl of fruit will greet (and satiate) the hungriest of breakfasters.   Now the crêpe clearly was modeled after the Leviathan, swimming in a sea of copious chocolate.  The dough of the crêpe itself straddles that of a Russian blintze and an American pancake, so there is definitely substance in there.  And one word of caution:  the banana-strawberry crêpe is served with a decent drizzling of chocolate, which is probably enough - order the banana-strawberry-chocolate crêpe only if you have a serious craving for chocolate.  As to the service, we were seated immediately, and though the establishment was (admitted by the waitress) understaffed, she smiled and mentioned that she would cover our table as well.  Overall, no delays, food arrived quickly - great breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Great breakfast potatoes, probably oven roasted. Great optional $3 fruit bowl. And $8 for 2 eggs, meat, a few fruit slices and toast is a pretty good deal.

The first two times I went here I ordered eggs over easy and both times the whites came runny. Like salmonella runny. So the third time I requested over medium and the eggs were perfect: yolk totally liquid and whites totally cooked. Yum, so I will add one more review star. Service was quick and attentive. Coffee refills were frequent. Plus it's ALL-DAY-BREAKFAST!"}
{"text":"We decided to walk here for breakfast the morning before leaving the city for our trek back to Buffalo.  We arrived and got seated promptly.  I only saw 2 people waiting tables, so I figured it would be a slow-go.  After a while, the waiter finally came over to ask if we wanted coffee, which we did.  He came back a few minutes later without the coffee to take our food order.  I ordered the classic benedict, to which he asked (in French) if I wanted coffee with it even though he had JUST taken our order for coffee.  My french-fluent boyfriend was confused by what he asked and said \"what?\", so the waiter ended up getting snippy with us about not telling him to use English, even though we would have been fine using French.

The food service was fairly slow.  It was a bit busy, but still on the slowish side.  It took about 10 minutes after ordering food (probably around 15 after ordering the coffee) that we actually got our coffee.  Meanwhile, people were coming in after us and getting served before us.

The food itself was delicious, and definitely a 4 or 5 star.  The benedict was awesome, and I loved the fresh fruit and potatoes.  My boyfriend ended up getting the wrong omelette than he ordered, but decided to just eat it and not take anymore time, since we wanted to get on the road.

When we were finished, we asked for the check, and the waiter left to, what I thought, was to get the check.  After around 10 minutes of him doing everything BUT get us the check (including giving the check to some parties who came in AFTER us), we just got up and walked up the register to pay rather than wait for him to bring it over to us.

The food was excellent, but the service was horrible.  We are unsure if he was just annoyed about the English-French confusion at the beginning or what, but we felt pretty annoyed by the end of the experience.  5 stars for food, 1 star for service."}
{"text":"I like the St Denis version of this place ok, and I certainly like the location on Peel and the charming gents who took me there, and the staff was friendly and without fault, and in general, you know, a-ok. But I ordered a salad and it was a pile of soggy blackened mesculn and that.. I frankly can't abide. It was clearly prepped hours before, and tasted tasted like poison, and if I never see box salad mesculn again it'll be too soon. And I guess. That's The End."}
{"text":"Nice brunch spot, just a cool, clean diner with a bit of a brasserie vibe: warm and cozy, fresh and sexy, next to Carré St Louis. A perfect starting point for a walk and shop on St Denis, or a browse and carouse on Prince Arthur. 

The waffles are fat fluffy homemade, the mounds of fruit are immaculately fresh and generous. All the plates we tried came with large portions of potatoes and fruit on the side. The service has been lovable, friendly and fast. 

On a could-be-better note: the mimosa was a little watery today, and the apple, bacon, cheddar crêpe had us pretty excited but flavour-wise fell a little flat - maybe if the apples were more caramelized, the cheddar a little sharper, the bacon more abundant, the crêpe a little lighter?

But these amount to small tweaks, overall Universel is a sweet solid option. You can't help but love to be tucked into a big, back booth all loaded up with breakfast food."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning based on reviews from Yelp. I took two of my daughters aged 8 and 10. I love Montreal because everyone says \"Bonjour\" but as soon as you reply \"Hello\" you are met courteously with English and not made to feel awkward. My kids were offered coloring books and crayons. Superb service from male server and another male that I'm assuming was an owner. My kids had never had crepes so the server offered the significantly lower priced child's menu which included juice for $4.50 when I was prepared to pay full price for an adult portion. I ordered the Universel Breakfast with 1 meat (could have had 3 meats and I was tempted) 2 eggs, real potato home fries, toast, beans, cretons, and bananas and strawberries on my crepes (was $14.95). All dishes came with an abundance of fruit (cantelope, pineapple, oranges). My meal was HUGE. I could not finish it and I'm a big eater and neither could my kids. My 8 year old devoured my baked beans. Neither liked the creton (I had to look this up because I never had it) but I loved it; a lardy spicy pork dish...yum (it reminded me of corned beef hash but different). Very clean, well decorated. I only visit Montreal once every couple of years but every time I am there I will definitely make this a stop for breakfast."}
{"text":"Very extensive menu, has everything you could want from breakfast to dinner. Service was good and food came out very quickly."}
{"text":"While our food selection consisted of only bowls of French Onion soup, Butternut Squash soup, and a small Caesar salad. (We were mid-day customers) the food we had was tasty.....the bulk of my rating however was for the service. Our server was prompt, courteous, and continually checked up on us. Quickly realizing we were visiting Montreal from the States, he even offered to help us in touring the city. Good food can be offered anywhere .....great service here!"}
{"text":"Wandering up the street in need of a decent but not expensive restaurant, we found that Universel (which has the Universal logo) was pretty much the last choice before Peel becomes residential housing. After a look at the menu, we decided that this was the place. Because the weather was nice, we sat outside.

A \"special\" menu offered a selection of different mussels and I chose one of those. A massive pile and served with the usual frites, I ate every one and then poured the left over frites into the sauce. Really excellent.

My friend had the steak he's been wanting for a few days and enjoyed it with a glass of their house red wine. While it was cooked a little longer than he wanted, he was still quite pleased with it.

Service was decent. It was a good meal in a nice restaurant and the price was okay. Was it the best? No. Was it good? Yes. Would I return? Probably yes."}
{"text":"Alors je me rends au Universal un mercredi matin, 9:00. À mon arrivée, on me fait signe de choisir une table. Je m'installe, seule à une table de 4, près de la fenêtre, dans ce grand restaurant quasi vide. Je pose mon IPad à mes côtés à l'aise pour lire ma Presse tout en regardant la ville se réveiller tranquillement. La serveuse me demande si je suis seule. Je lui réponds par l'affirmative. Réponse : \"Ben, vous avez pris une table à quatre...\" Je me dis dans ma tête \"euh, ouin... Pis\" mais en réalité je lui réponds poliment \"est-ce un problème, dois-je changer de place? Le resto est vide.\" Elle me dit \"Ben, c'est correct, mais on ne sait jamais... C'est une table populaire\"

Bon, à moins qu'elle attende un autobus de 100 personnes d'ici la prochaine heure en ce mercredi matin, je ne vois pas c'est quoi le problème. Et de toute façon, parce que je suis seule je dois m'installer dans le fond au noir près des toilettes....?

Elle est chanceuse de m'avoir si bien servie pour le restant du service.

Côté bouffe, le menu est bien élaboré, beaucoup de choix. J'ai été pour le spécial lève-tôt deux ufs, patates, viandes, pas cher du tout, 8$ avec pourboire. C'était bon. Les assiettes des autres clients étaient bien garnies. 

Je donnerais 3.5*!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on my first trip to Montreal. Ordered the Universel Breakfast which had 2 eggs, option of meat (I got ham), option for crepe or French toast (got crepe), and came with potatoes, beans and crotens (pork spread), and toast. I didn't know it came with some fruits as well, so I opted for adding strawberries. The meal was huge. Price is reasonable but quality of food is fresh so I think it's an decent value if you're hungry. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Although given great reviews on yelp, we found this place to be fairly ho-hum. The food was tasty, but the service was somewhat lackluster and there was no ambiance. It was a plus that they serve breakfast all day, and I enjoyed my omelette which was served with a side of fruit. Also appreciated the free wifi."}
{"text":"Plat très copieux, service rapide. Une super place pour bruncher."}
{"text":"Great brunch! Had the scrambled eggs with French toast-- delicious! Plate came with fruit and delicious potatoes. Pretty big portions! A must if in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Home fries were amazing.. This restaurant was so close to our hotel we wished we came here everyday!"}
{"text":"Just finished delicious banana-strawberry-English-cream crepe complemented by sausages! Delicious."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey for what it is, brunch, however I've never had a poor time at Universel. I love the airport feel of the Saint-Denis location. The food is good. I usually prefer it to Eggspectations, however the Eggspectations at Place des Arts last time really surprised me! Now I'm conflicted.

I like both, my favourite breakfast go-tos."}
{"text":"Un de mes premiers brunch à mon arrivé à Montréal et je dois dire qu'il était copieux. Le cadre est sympa et le personne souriant et réactif. 

Le cadre n'est surement pas le plus exceptionnel mais ça reste grand, propre et tout le monde à d l'espace pour manger tranquillement. 

Bon je ne vais pas vous cacher que coté gout c'est relativement classique mais si vous vous décidé à prendre une gaufre après le repas je vous conseille d'avoir des amis pour partager."}
{"text":"Seated at the sunny patio with music and white plastic tables. Prompt and friendly service. Good poached egg with mushroom and bacon on bagel. Thin style bacon and home fried potatoes excellent."}
{"text":"Je voulais depuis un certain temps essayer leur moules/frites. Les frites maisons je pense, étaient dégueulasse, trop cuites, molles, ça n'avait pas l'air d'être des patates douces mais était assez sucrées. J'ai l'impression qu'elles ont été cuites dans la même huile que la vieille, voire plus. Les moules, je les ai trouvées trop sèches mais bien assaisonnées, la portion est suffisante pour une personne. Rapport qualité/prix convenable. Service ok."}
{"text":"Wow. I came here for breakfast one morning and was thoroughly impressed by the service and the food. Amahzing.

So I got some eggs benedict which came with potatoes and fruit. Was about $14, not bad for the amount! Also, I think they used a delicious montreal bagel in place of the english muffin, yum!

My friend got a breakfsast platter which included everything, including cretons which i have never tried, but found out that it is delicious and the amounts of food were very generous especially for the price."}
{"text":"Service was slow/non existent. The mimosa I ordered came out with the food, had to ask the busser for coffee, food came out cold, grabbed our own sauces from server station. We spoke to the manager and he gave us a free smoothie? 

The food was good and portions are generous, but I would not visit again."}
{"text":"Fantastic!
 We stumbled upon this place on our last day...the food is amazing, portions generous, price pretty reasonable for what you get.
 I'd lived in Montreal previously, and never been able to find a place like this. It was either one end of the spectrum: super healthy or really greasy. This is a brilliant balance of the two, with the \"greasy\" (ie. home-fries, bacon) not greasy at all."}
{"text":"Really don't get the hype about this place. When I came here my whole table noticed that the glasses were dirty, which was the first thing that turned me off the place. When our food arrived it really wasn't that impressive, basically the same stuff you can get at a Cora's, tastes the same. You're better off getting brunch someplace at the Plateau. If you're in MTL to visit, skip this."}
{"text":"I have come here twice and loved it! The food is fresh and yummy! There might be a small wait but worth it !"}
{"text":"This is one of those places FOOD COMA will hit you. The waiters and waitresses were very flexible with speaking English and French. The atmosphere was quite nice and clean. Opinion of indoor seating or outdoor.  

Great way to start the day with breakfast or brunch. I had their Classic Eggs benedict (2 poached eggs, ham, cheese on an English muffin) with the L'univers (Strawberries, banana, blueberries, melon, kiwi, honey and orange). The egg benedict seem very simple and not a large portion but it was actually very fulling. I love when restaurants serve fruits as a side with the meal, as full as you are some fruits won't hurt. 

The food came really quickly and the service was pretty good. Great for breakfast & brunch and the prices are affordable."}
{"text":"This place is dope! The service was so on point. I think Lysandre was our waitress and she was so good I had to leave this quick review. Amazing food, amazing service and good music too!"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible place . The worst service I've ever experienced in Montreal . Avoid my friends !"}
{"text":"Universel is known for its famous brunch. So why not go there? After waiting in line for about 20 min, we saw that there's the option to sit at the bar which was not mentioned. So if there's a line, you could try doing that which also has great service there!

I got the Universel breakfast which is huge! but once you see it and try it, oh god its the best thing. From now on that's going to be my usual. I had the scrambled eggs, with crepes, beans, toast and bacon, which I know is a lot, but I was starving and everything was just delicious. Also, everything is your choice! so you dont necessarily have to get bacon or crepes etc."}
{"text":"Began with very friendly service. This was first experience in Montreal facing a language barrier but it was no problem here! Menus were in English as well and server along with the hostess were pleasant. The food was fantastic, I recommend the universel for brunch it's a fully loaded meal at great value. The chai latte was delicious as well, will be going back before we go home again!"}
{"text":"The Universel omelette had so much in it (both meat and vegetables) you could barely see the eggs! I'm so glad I asked to hold the potatoes and toast and substitute fruit; the omelette in itself was a full and satisfying meal. Definitely not pretty, but pretty tasty...I went late morning on a weekday so I can't comment on how busy it can be, but I sat at the bar and had my food in less than ten minutes. An excellent meal for someone who only really eats two meals a day."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast twice; first time was to have a good sized breakfast to load up on carbs to burn off while we hiked Mount Royal. I enjoyed their eggs benedict and my friend ordered their eggs benedict florentine. The space is pretty large with a lot of indoor and outdoor seating; when there is a line to be seated and the place is packed, well that's a sign the food must be good. The service was a little slow due to not enough servers. I enjoyed my eggs benedict I just wish it was hot and not just warm, it was fine I ate the whole thing. I also enjoyed their iced mochachino. 
On my second morning stop in the line and wait time was even longer than the day before. No one gave up on waiting and neither did we. We had a plan of what we wanted to order and we had a plan on stuffing our faces with two huge breakfasts we could share. This time we ordered waffles with bananas and strawberries; an order of eggs benedict florentine and a side of bacon (see photos). I'm glad we came back and waited, their waffles are out of this world amazing. We added their maple syrup which is delicious and it was just the perfect topping. The only thing this place is missing is more staff."}
{"text":"First off kudos for accepting a 9 person reservation on a Sunday!

Next, I will say the service here is very good. Waiters often come by to refill your coffee and water, which is definitely a plus! 

The food is very good as well. I had the bacon eggs Benedict, with perfectly cooked eggs. The side potatoes were good and for once, and this is rare, the side of fruit was actually delicious! Forget that unripe pineapple and derelict cantaloupe.. This is the real deal! Kiwi, honeydew, banana, cantaloupe, two kinds of apple, yum! 

My only gripe is that the eggs could have been ever so slightly warmer, and having made hollandaise myself I would have added a bit more lemon. 

That being said the food, atmosphere and service were very good and this place is definitely an interesting competition to the Cafe Cherrier across the street."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our breakfast here. We got here about 10:30 on a Saturday and were seated right away.  Good coffee, good food (both had combos of eggs and crepes) and good service.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Classic egg bene is good! It serves with ham, eggs and potatoes. Also paired with fruits I can say very delicious"}
{"text":"I came here on two separate occasions. Salmon benedict and the fruit platter are excellent options. I didn't care much for the bread used for the benedict but since there was so much food, I ended up eating mainly just the salmon and egg. Potatoes and fruits came with the benedict-- the fruit was fresh and the potatoes were delicious.

The fruit platter was good too. Large plate with a great variety of fruits. They were sweeter and smaller than what I'm used to, so probably organic. Plus, the strawberries were all a deep red; not overly large and white (You'll only know wth I'm talking about if you're from the states and eat the non-organic crap)

The side of bacon was weak; flimsy thin cut slices. Definitely could do without that.... sucks because I love bacon!

-Berry smoothie and the mimosas were both pretty tasty too
-Cappuccino was no good
-Had the same waitress both days; she was terrific
-Restaurant gets packed for breakfast; there may be a little wait
-Nice setup to the layout of the restaurant; they pay attention to a lot of little details"}
{"text":"Merci pour ce dejeuner servit en 2mins après avoir commandé. Ca m'a pas prit plus de 20 secondes pour réaliser qu'il devait secher sur la plaque chauffante depuis un moment. Tout était froid et même les toast semblaient avoir été faîtes il y a un moment. Complètement froide et dures. Dejeuner de très moyenne qualité si on oublie le fait que c'est pas cuit sur commande."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food. Omelettes are great. Stake and eggs is really good too. I tried some of my friend's French Toasts and they were really good. Great breakfast spot"}
{"text":"A fine option for breakfast or lunch downtown. Huge menu of sandwiches, breakfasty goods like eggs/benedicts, waffles, crepes, etc. Plus tasty liquid refreshment like juices/smoothies, coffees, etc.

I came on a Saturday afternoon and didn't have a wait at all, even though it was definitely pretty busy. Got a tasty juice of strawberries, mango, banana, yogurt, honey, and cranberries. So good! For my meal I went with the strawberry breakfast combo which was 2 eggs, potatoes, crepes with strawberries, and toast. Huge portions and a ton of variety for just $12. Those combos are totally the way to go if you want something sweet AND savory.  And everything was perfectly cooked and tasty. 

Service was quick and nice enough. The space is bright and light. It does get a bit loud when busy, so just an FYI. A woman in the party next to me was clearly very hungover and didn't seem too thrilled by the volume. Ha!"}
{"text":"Food is great in terms of portions. Also pretty delicious in terms of taste. We were quickly seated because there's a lot of seating at this location... I was actually surprised since it looked like a decent wait but it was pretty immediate. Service was a bit slow but probably because there were quite a few tables occupied.

If you're looking for a hearty meal, you can definitely rely on the multiple locations of this restaurant through Montreal!"}
{"text":"Dear Universel Déjeuner & Grillades - Peel management, 

First and foremost, BRAVO!

I wanted to sincerely thank you for abruptly cancelling my wife's surprise bday party reservation for 25 people at 11:30 when everyone had all already arrived, leaving a 6month pregnant customer and a 6month enfant unseated left freezing in the rain outside,  because you felt you could monitize Sunday brunch better with small groups of people. 

I congratulate you for letting corporate greed blind you from what the restaurant business values most, customer service and common human decency.

Thankfully, my group and I were screaming surprise to my wife at exactly noon at pizzeria n900 just next door who were kind enough to accommodate on such short notice. (Refer to my review) 

I furthermore wanted to thank you for being so rude to one of my friends who's six months pregnant who you wouldn't allow to sit at any table until the group arrived.I furthermore thank you for doing the same to another attending couple who carried a 6 month old enfant, left standing and waiting in the rain.

My friends have had enough at that point and redirected everyone to pizzeria n900 right next door, with my wife and I arriving just in time for the bday surprise at noon.

I fail to see how such treatment of large group reservations seems at all appropriate, or at all good for PR in a day and age when reviews make or break a restaurant.

It pains me to write this because the cooking staff, and the waiting staff are apparently renowned for great food and great service.

Sad to see how the incompetency of management overshadows an apparently great restaurant.

Advice for anyone who's looking not to have their appetite ruined for a Sunday brunch, don't bother making reservations (they're worthless). Just go to pizzeria n900, they are as down to earth as people get, and actually do some impressive work, such as a breakfast pizza, for a living, unlike universel management.

For universel management, seek professional help, there's hospitality courses you can surely take. 

Regards, 

David Goldbaum, MBA"}
{"text":"My friend and I walked to Mont-Royal (from NDG neighborhood) and then needed food.  I spotted Universel.  It was crowded and had a decent wait but the food going by us looked amazing.  Very glad we waited.  This may have been the best breakfast I have had.   It was so good, we considered going back the next day even though it was out of the way.  I thought the price was great for the amount of food we got.  And the staff was excellent!  Wish it was local to me and not 555km away."}
{"text":"An average breakfast location but very convenient for tourist and hotel guests. I had the Spanish egg Benedict and it was on par with others I have had in the pass. Nothing special on the Egg Benedict. 

One thing that was really good that came with most orders is the fruit bowl on the side. It comes with an array of fresh fruits and goes along quite well with the main course! Compared to other breakfast restaurants that only give you 1-3 pieces of fruit. The fruit bowl contains plenty of fruits to give you a healthy start for your day.

On weekends, come early or expect to wait in line. Call ahead to make a reservation for bigger parties.

I also enjoyed the clean atmosphere and decors of the location but the seats are built a bit close to each other. Servers were professional and friendly. 

If you are looking for a breakfast location that has reasonable offerings and price, come by. Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Regardless of whichever Universel you try (Peel or St Denis) you will appreciate how good this place is. Whatever meal you go for you wont be disappointed. 

Their breakfast/brunch is always superb and I have a soft spot for their foccacia pizza.

Now if you just go for their 5 a 7, they have great deal too! Just remember not to get carried away.

The staff are very friendly , the service is great and that's why I, among others, keep coming back."}
{"text":"On s'entend que c'est une chaîne donc je ne m'attendais à rien de spéciale en rentrant. Je me suis retrouvé dans ce restaurant pour un déjeuner d'affaire, je suis arrivé la première et on m'a très vite installé et donné un menu. Le décor est vraiment fancy, je pense que la décoration est la plus travaillée de tout les Universels que j'ai vu, il y a une cave à vin, c'est très spacieux...

Au niveau du menu, je dois dire que le choix est vaste, il y en a vraiment pour tout les goûts, mais je n'ai pas vu beaucoup de plat sans produit laitier (végétalien fait attention). Une fois tout le monde arrivé nous avons commandé, j'ai pris un bagel avec du fromage à la crème et une coupe de fruits. Je vous avoue que j'ai été déçu, je n'attendais rien du bagel, évidement je savais que ni le bagel ni le fromage aller être WoW, mais pas au point de recevoir du fromage en forme de boule de glace mais la plus grosse déception fut la coupe de fruits. Rien sur le menu indiqué que la coupe de fruit venez avec du yaourt et du gruau, apparement une simple coupe de fruits n'existe pas. Autre cela le service est impeccable et très sympathique."}
{"text":"LOVE!!! Found this place on Yelp while we were visiting Montreal for a long weekend and it didn't disappoint! Wait wasn't too long, service was prompt and food was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I don't really see what the fuss is all about for this place.

We asked for a table for 8 people, on a sunday at 12, so of course you can expect to wait for a table, but what I really REALLY don't like is when the waitress tells you :
\" - It's going to be a 10mn wait
 Comes back 25mn later
 - 5 more minutes guys
 50mn after we entered the place, we have our table\"

From 10 to 50 minutes, excuse me but ... Fuck off.

Food wise ...Well it's not bad and the plate is full for a reasonable price, my breakfast Burrito was ok, but that's the thing : I had way better in places not so packed. 
It's big, noisy, absolutely no atmosphere whatsoever so.... Yeah I just don't get it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed watching a tiny older caricature at an adjoining table tell the waiter he had left a \"rather generous tip.\" This tip turned out to be about three quarters and a few nickels on a full breakfast tab. Even allowing for the presence of old Monsieur Skinflint, there's a convivial atmosphere. Lots of older regulars and lots of characters.

The food was fine. To hear it described here and elsewhere, one might think that diner food had been revolutionized. Not so. As far as I'm concerned, nothing out of the ordinary. That's not such a bad thing when the omelettes aren't greasy and the tab is reasonable. And I guess since the United States is entirely opting out of the good proletariat diner genre, a place like l'Universel might get a little extra credit."}
{"text":"2nd Time again and they remembered us!!! 
Wow what a wonderful spot for the best drinks in town! I have to admit they are the best in my eyes by far!!!

The bartenders are so friendly and sweet! They really go the extra mile to answer all your needs! They joke and conversate with us and theyre amazingly amicable ! Kent , andy and Dorothy, you gave an excellent service and definitelywill be back again here very very soon :)"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast, we had the mushroom and universel Eggs Benny and they were great. The service was even better, fantastic waitress"}
{"text":"Depending on what impress you, if you are more impressed by size thats a definite place to go :)   Quality and the price are adjusted and it has a better ambiance than lot of other places."}
{"text":"We thought we wanted to try somewhere different for breakfast vs. our first day in Montreal so chose this place via my Yelp perusal's.  It wasn't bad.  I had an egg white omelet with mushrooms and brie cheese.  Would have preferred the cheese to have been more melted as there was sections of the omelet that were not.  The potatoes were slightly crunches and well seasoned and the small side of fresh fruit was a nice addition.  Kendal had eggs and crepes which also came with potatoes so a healthy portion.  The crepes had fresh strawberries on top which were very sweet.  The crepe had a nice flavor as well but the texture was slightly more rubbery than preferred.  Earlton enjoyed his poached eggs (The Goat) and didn't share any of it (smile).  All and all a good breakfast.  The service was perfectly fine.  We sat on the terrace which was cramped and if I went back would definitely prefer a seat inside, although the inside was also a bit tight."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill fast.  Was here last year and everything was fresh and memorable.. While the atmosphere and presentation is still there, I don't think I ever got a croissant from a supermarket at a French breakfast place.  Same goes for their \"fresh squeezed\" OJ from concentrate.  For the meal I got an omelette with mushrooms and Brie.  Asked for red peppers and got green instead.  It was ok.  My wife got the poutine with a hot dog instead of sausage.

It's too bad, because until this morning I don't remember having even a poor meal in Montreal."}
{"text":"Superbe premier petit déjeuner à Montréal. Les plats sont très copieux et le sirop d'érable délicieux"}
{"text":"Très bon breakfast servi avec amitié. Bon rapport qualité prix en sus. Rien à dire. C'est le bon choix."}
{"text":"Generous portions of tasty breakfast staples. Nice, light waffles, but the crepes are a bit dense.  The milkshakes were a big hit with kids, as well as the eggs and fruit. Overall, a good value for a filling and satisfying brunch."}
{"text":"The food was good but I'm giving it 4 stars because the hollandaise was string on the poutine was not poutine just home fries"}
{"text":"\"Very average\" is how I would describe my experience at Universel Déjeuner et Grillades. While the food is not exactly terrible, it is barely okay and definitely too pricey for what it is.

My husband and I went visited Universel on a Tuesday evening during \"Happy Hour\" (4-7PM), which allows for two drinks for the price of one, a very nice touch and probably the only redeeming part of the experience, alongside the waiter's mostly genuine but strained smile. I had a veggie pizza which turned out to be as unmemorable as any other cheap pizza place (except I would probably pay less for it elsewhere - heck, even pizzapizza is tastier!). He had a vegetarian souvlaki which was first served to him with chicken, until we went to the counter to point out there had been a mistake with our order. Five minutes later, the right plate was brought from the kitchen; much better, but still very \"okay\" taste-wise.

The sangria was good enough, and so was the house red wine, especially with the 2 for 1 promotion. The place looks nice... And that's pretty much it. Unexciting experience. I can think of many better places to spend my money at in Montreal's vibrant restaurant scene. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Good start muscles were generous and tasty.  Unfortunately they did not compare well with a French restaurant in New Jersey my home state. I had high expectations being in Montreal."}
{"text":"I went to the Universel Dejeuneuers at 359 Rue St. Catherine and had a wonderful evening meal upon arrival in Montreal.  It was about 9:30 p.m. and I had the Italian wedding soup and cod fillet, so delicious!  The server, Kent, had time to speak with me because they were approaching closing at 11 p.m.  It was a pleasant experience and set the tone for a wonderful few days in Montreal.  Highly recommended for good food, large portions, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Universal is an excellent brunch restaurant! My sister and I stopped in around 10AM on a Sunday before heading into Parc Mont-Royal- we definitely needed some food in our bodies before any type of hiking! 

Although I had seen some reviews saying that service was slow, I thought that our waitress was pretty quick and we didn't have any trouble getting her attention. We ordered one big and one small orange juice, and a small coffee was complimentary with my sister's combo meal. 

Food portions were quite large. We ordered:
1. Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon: perfect! And came with the fruit bowl. 
2. Sister's combo: I forget which one she had but she got a combo with waffles, Nutella (or some other chocolate hazelnut spread), bananas and strawberries. You should've seen her face of bliss! Even though we had nothing in our stomachs, she still couldn't finish it!

Overall, very good brunch. 4/5."}
{"text":"Pour notre brunch hebdomadaire de fin de semaine nous avons décidé de venir ici. Bref nous avons un peu attendu avant d'avoir une table. nous avons pris le breakfast universel avec gaufre aux bananes et nutella. Pour 15dollars cetai vraiment copieux. Il y avait une grosse portion de pomme de terre.le bacon était croustillant. Et la gaufre était bonne. Le service était rapide et la serveuse agréable. Peut-être que la portion de viande était un peu petite. Sinon tout était très bon"}
{"text":"A pretty good place for hangover brunch. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful but, well, I was very hungover.

It does tea and pancakes and that was good at the time."}
{"text":"Propose des déjeuners et repas pour le lunch et le dîner. La nourriture n'est pas exceptionnelle mais juste correcte. Je n'ai pas raffolé des gaufres qui semblaient bonnes mais finalement sèches. Service un peu trop froid à mon goût. J'aime bien la terrasse en été elle donne sur la rue Peel et ai assez calme. Bonne option pour un déjeuner simple mais sans plus. Au moins les portions sont généreuses"}
{"text":"My wife and I had our first breakfast in Montreal at this wonderful restaurant while we were on vacation. Service was impeccable. The food came out quickly and was presented beautifully. The portion sizes were overwhelming, the price is very reasonable. 

The food taste is extraordinarily fresh, with a delicate balance of both sweet and savory with every bite. This place is a must if you're looking for a solid breakfast choice. The only thing I was not a fan of, was my stomach's inability to devour another breakfast."}
{"text":"I visited this place twice during my trip to Montreal, and was not disappointed. I had the universel omelette, which was full of various meats and veggies, and perfectly filling. The homefries were mediocre, but the fresh fruit was a nice little addition. Coffee was great, and the mimosa was pretty standard. Service was a bit slow. It seemed to be because we were sitting outside, but I wasn't sure. However, the staff was still friendly. I would come back here again, but I'd be interested to see what other brunch options are like in Montreal."}
{"text":"Incredible breakfast place!! Came here with 2 people on a Sunday morning around 9. No wait at all, we got seated right by a big beautiful window. Extensive menu with tons of options. Service was great, food was FANTASTIC and came out with large portions. Price was super reasonable. As a tourist, I appreciated that it wasn't too touristy or overpriced. Would absolutely recommend to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Great little brunch place tucked away on this busy street with indoor-outdoor seating.  We walked in on a Monday morning and were seated right away.

Our waitress was darling, she was friendly, quick and helpful.

I ordered the assorted fruit waffle with English cream. What a visual and taste bud delight. Absolute spectacular in every way.

My husband ordered the crepe with Apple, bacon and cheddar. It was served with home fries and a side of fruit. The home fries were spot on for me. The crepe was not cult of tea but my husband loved it so it was a draw. 

Prices were very reasonable and we spent a lovely morning sitting on the covered patio. Highly recommend you try it for breakfast."}
{"text":"What a cute restaurant! We came here for breakfast which they have a good amount of options to choose from. Our waitress was friendly and spoke both English and French which was neat.

I ordered the strawberry banana granola yogurt while my boyfriend had the crepe with a bunch of fruits. Both entrees were good and healthy which I could eat like this everyday. If you like coffee and want to get that relaxing breakfast feel, you should get a cafe au lait. The cafe au lait was smooth and the right amount of foaminess.

Come check out this place if you have a chance!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast!  Yelpers got it right again. I've never seen so many variations of eggs Benedict. The bacon one was fantastic. The cappuccino is also great. Great service and kid friendly. They offer my 5 yr old a coloring book and crayons as soon as we were seated. Great find in Montreal."}
{"text":"An enthusiastic \"meh\". I came craving burgers, but left unsatisfied. The place has a good ambiance and the staff are friendly, but the burgers aren't worth it.

I had the American burger with fried onions and cream cheese, and while the toppings were decent enough, every bite of the burger reminded me of a frozen patty from a grocery store."}
{"text":"Me and my friend saw drinks in this establishments window and decided we wanted to sit down for a couple drinks. We told the hostess this and we asked to sit at the bar so we wouldn't take up a table for another guest to come in. We go to the bar and there were two workers at the bar spread apart leaving no room for my friends and I to sit. Not to mention they were extremely rude to us, telling us we couldn't sit in the open seats because they were in the way of the employees.... WHY HAVE A SEAT THERE THEN??? mind you WE are the paying customers. Shouldn't the employees move for their guests so we can have the dining experience we were expecting... maybe I'm crazy but these employees need a reality check? And to top everything off we were not even given a drink menu... WHAT WE CAME FOR AND TOLD THEM WE JUST CAME FOR A DRINK. we should have just left. I do not recommend.. the drinks were not even worth it. Annoyed."}
{"text":"Pretty standard diner food with a more upscale ambiance. My fries were a little greasy,  and my club sandwich was decent. I'd probably take a risk on a new restaurant in the hopes of finding something more exciting. However, Universel is open late and it is a fine option with such constraints."}
{"text":"Excellent place, outstanding service, delicious food, the best breakfast place, we were traveling from BROOKLYN, NY, I can say I had the best food here out of what we have tried in Montreal so far"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a late dinner on a Friday night. Thought this was a lunch/brunch place so I was surprised that they were still open and had a regular menu. It's deceiving from the outside since it looks pretty casual, but inside it looks more formal. We had an awesome waiter who was very friendly and social. Food portions were large and tasted good. Our hotel was right next door so we saw every morning that it was pretty busy."}
{"text":"Reliable brunch place in downtown Montreal. There's an endless selection on the menu... Anything you could ever want in brunch is in the Universal Breakfast (Eggs, meat, pancake / waffle / french toast, potatoes, toast and fruit). The heated terrasse at the Peel location is quite cozy. 

The only downside is the chaos at the entrance on busy weekends. They need a better system for seating people. It's never clear if you need to put down your name or not, how long the wait is going to be, if there is even a hostess etc. Otherwise the actual service at the table is attentive and efficient. 

Promising spot for downtown brunch any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie to you, food is pretty good - on par for what you'd expect from a typical breakfast restaurant. However if you are a religious brunch-eater, don't even bother. The long line and pretty patio are enough to draw you in, but the service was mediocre AT BEST. Don't expect your table or menus to be clean, and you can forget substituting or altering your order in any way - seeing as they will blatantly ignore your request. As if finding a bee carcus in my coffee wasn't enough to make sure this was a one time visit, the waitor actually requested that my friend tip higher ... Holding us all up and leaving me feeling as bitter as the unripe melons i was given as a poor excuse for fruit. 4/10 wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great for those that are traveling with picky eaters as this spot has a little bit of everything. The price is also reasonable! The service provided was also good."}
{"text":"Service was great.  
They have great brunch here.  My girlfriend and I both got eggs Benny and they were very good along with the hashbrowns and salad."}
{"text":"Breakfast is always a treat here and a must stop for us when visiting Canada. The crepes are light and decadent at the same time. And the yogurt cup with fresh strawberries & bananas with house made granola served with warmed local honey... Its AMAZING. the staff is always warm and welcoming and the cherry on top of this figurative sundae."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday day late morning and there was a line up but we only waited about 5mins  they had things moving quickly which was great. I ordered the French toast w bananas strawberries and  Nutella...it was great! 
My partner ordered eggs toast home fries and beans he also loved it ..over medium and cooked to perfection ..can't complain at all."}
{"text":"We loved the food, portion size, service and visited several times during our trip to Montreal.  One thing I thought was a bit off was the home potatoes served with breakfast, they were a little sweet.  I was just reading an article that storing potatoes in the refrigerator can make them sweet and break down the starch, so i'm mentioning that here in case they happen to take a look :-)  I would still go back regardless of the slightly sweet potatoes.


Potatoes
Cold temps will break down the starches in potatoes, making them unpleasantly sweet and gritty. Cool and dry darkness is a spud's best bud."}
{"text":"Love it here! Universel breakfast was huge and everything on the plate was delicious. Also recommend egg benedict - fruit comes with it was great! Staff are very friendly too! It's a bit pricey but the experience will give you a great start of the day!"}
{"text":"We walked past Cafe Universal on our way from the metro to our hotel on Sherbrook and noticed it was always full.  We stopped by for breakfast and were in heaven with the many choices of poached eggs and crepes, fresh squeezed juices, and much more.  I loved the eggs benedict with goat cheese and mushrooms. I was the best I'd ever had.  there was barely room to squeeze in the over-sized crepe with chocolate, bananas, and fresh strawberries but we managed.

The meal was beautifully prepared (fresh fruit and delicious roasted potatoes on the side), great service, and useful location.

We'll be back next time we're in Montreal."}
{"text":"went here for brunch and breakfast is served until 5pm!! my friends and i had 2 pitchers of red sangria (30$) and mimosa ($42). they were both well made, not watered down at all. I had the universal breakfast which came with toast, 2 eggs, fruits, and choice of bacon vs sausage, and waffles vs french toast vs crepe - all for $16. the drink service was quite slow but they made up for thr food being fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I went there with my 10-month-old baby in the early morning. There were only two or three guests, and I asked for a high chair the first moment I entered the restaurant. But nobody brought me a high chair until the third time I requested. I was really really upset about this. And the waitresses are not that friendly, they all have cold faces, no greetings, not even a smile in the morning. For the food, nothing outstanding, it is like most of the brunch places. But for the service, I am totally unsatisfied, so I can only give 2."}
{"text":"Went for dinner.  Pretty mediocre food, overall.  
Milkshake made with ice and milk, not ice cream (odd, though not unheard of).  Fries were limp, both as sides and in poutine.  Poutine had very dark brown sauce  (not the normal one) but plenty of cheese. Service was good.  For similar prices but better food, one should go to Ruben's down the street."}
{"text":"Good food with lots of options. Great service, Emily took really good care of us. Thank you! It was a wonderful evening :) 
I went back for supper and I can confirm, this place should come up to your mind when ever you want to have a great meal alone or with friends, date, etc... When you go for the first time and you're satisfied it might be luck but when you go more than twice it's an evidence. Go! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Even if there's a \" Universel \" on peel. Yet on sainte  Catherine the service is more careful. The waiters were nice and made sure we were all good and comfortable. Food was good. According to my taste I think there wasn't enough meat on my meal. But would totally recommend it. Affordable price. You will even things around 9-10$. Suitable for kids. It's a great place to brunch, or else. But I would recommend personally the brunch menu."}
{"text":"Universel is conveniently located near my work so it is good when my friends and I want to duck out of the office for a proper sit down lunch.  It is slightly more expensive than what I like to pay for lunch but once in a while doesn't hurt.  For brunch they serve your typical brunch menu.  I usually get a classic breakfast plate that has sausage, toast, potatoes, eggs and crepes.  It's okay food but nothing really stands out.

It's not bad but it doesn't blow me away.  Montreal has an abundance of good brunch spots and while it is one of the better places downtown it doesn't match the really good ones in other neighbourhoods.   It is also slightly more expensive compared to other brunch places so it's the kind of restaurant I'll go to when I can't get out of the downtown core."}
{"text":"Ordered the banana and chocolate crepe.  It was loaded with nutella.  Not the best I've had but wasn't bad."}
{"text":"Just what the doctor ordered--all day American breakfast comfort food. I had the eggs Benedict universal with English muffins instead of the bagel.  The food was excellent including presentation.  The service was excellent and the prices were reasonable.  We will come back the next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Long wait on a Sunday, worth it... Friendly staff and outstanding Brunch!  We'll be back!PAD SI EOW"}
{"text":"This was a nice little brunch spot we hit up on a Saturday morning in October. The patio was enclosed at this point since it's cold out but they still let us bring our bulldog in and gave him a bowl of water under the table. The service was quick and friendly and portions very large and filling. Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon was good but I've certainly had much better at brunch spots back home. My wife got a strawberry crepe with English cream and she seemed to enjoy it. Overall, solid spot for brunch and we did not wait long at all for a table, but nothing I would go out of my way to recommend or go back to next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch and was surprised to see how empty it was at 10 am on a Sunday morning. I got the bacon eggs Benedict. It wasn't the best I have ever had but the hollandaise sauce is very good, so I can see why people rave about it. My eggs were over-cooked, though, so I didn't get the nice runny yolks I was hoping for. The accompanying fruit was also not fresh. While service was quick, I felt that it was mainly to turn over the table. I definitely felt rushed and did not get the relaxing brunch I was hoping for."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and it was delicious, I would go back. The vibe between staff was a little off. It kind of looked like management was unhappy with a server, and it looked like gossip was happening, a little weird, but the food was great."}
{"text":"This place has a heated patio and is a super popular breakfast destination that is conveniently located a short walk from the Peel metro station. The universel egg benny is absolutely delicious and you get a great variety and generous portion of fruit! Decor, presentation, and service were all superb as well."}
{"text":"Not as popular as the downtown location but location, service, and food still remain great."}
{"text":"Delicious!
Woke this afternoon, my wife was having trouble finding which restaurant to go, so I YELPed it!

The breakfast/brunch is amazing and it arrived quite fast after we ordered it. Great I dying of hunger lol.

I was really pleased with the food, although I ordered the standard, easy, traditional, most simple breakfast; eggs, bacon, ham & sausage. And my love ordered the original benedict.

Service is okay, on their defence... They are really crowded and the place is all packed! With that kind of food, it makes perfect sense! :)

Price is not bad at all, roughly average $11-$13 per person with coffee and stuff.

Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Standard diner food. Big portions. Extremely slow service during Sunday brunch. I got the billy goat which is smoked salmon, spinach, goat cheeses, poached eggs with hollandaise sauce all over a bagel. It was fine."}
{"text":"Decided to walk the two blocks from our hotel to try Universel since it received good reviews on Yelp.  I'd maybe give it a 3-1/2 stars?

The place has a good ambiance and the staff are friendly.  The vegetarian pizza and Caesar salad was good, but the burger was just fair.  Not sure what kind of beef meat is used for this burger?  The meat looked a little like a frozen over cooked patty, but we were told they cook their burgers with no red?  I've also had better French fries."}
{"text":"It was a great experience. The brunch was great and the prices were reasonable. I also liked the environment. Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"Beware of this place especially if you're getting the daily sets. Not even kidding, the dessert slice of cake was about a cm thick and 5cm long (it was a wedge too so half the volume you're thinking). They ran out of their original dessert so they chose to screw over customers. Paying customers. Unapologetic and unhelpful manager's only response to my complaint was: So you want the check? Use to go here pretty regularly but will be avoiding from henceforth and advising anyone i come across to strictly skip this place. Scam."}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant we tried after arriving late into Montreal late one evening.  The concierge at Omni Hotel provided us with some options and Universel was the first one and virtually right next door to the hotel.  Universel was so good that we went back twice during the week in Montreal.  
The place has a combination of outdoor seating under a covered area and the indoor dining room.  Tables consist of smaller two seaters to comfy booth seating.  They have a good selection of many different food selections from sandwiches to seafood and the traditional steak frites.  I would recommend the moule with frites which is the mussels served in your choice of 4 different sauces and fries.  The serving is a huge heaping bowlful of juicy mussels and a basket of fries.  My only wish was that the fries are the thinner variety vs the freshcut which they serve. 
Desserts are decadent here and ordered the chocolate mousse cake and a side of vanilla ice cream.  The pricing is reasonable and even better converted to USD from CAD. Service is top notch here with friendly and careful attention by its servers.  We had the privilege of having Francis the first visit which was topped by Anabelle on our last visit.  She is the BEST!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our brunch here! My only regret is that we found this place on our last day in Montreal! We were looking for a chill place to have brunch and this fit the bill. The menu is expansive and there was so much we wanted to sample. We ordered the florentine eggs benedict, the salmon omlette, a 1/2 order of the nutella and banana waffle and a nutella, banana, and strawberry crepe. It was all a generous portion and delicious.  I loved that they are open early and close late each day. We got there on a Sunday at 10am expecting to have a wait, but we found parking easily, we were sat immediately and served quickly. We sat in the enclosed patio and while there were a lot of people there, it felt comfortable. Our server was outstanding too. I highly recommend and we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast spot, server was amazing food was delicious! Was visiting from Toronto I would go again!"}
{"text":"It's with a heavy heart that I write this review as I was the one who suggested that my friends and I come here for brunch. Unfortunately, I was the only one who left this restaurant extremely unsatisfied. 

The service is incompetent. There's one good server and everyone else is no good. One of the servers spilled my water all over our table, on me, and then all over my seat. I could sense that he was inexperienced and I also overheard him saying under his breath: \"well, this is off to a great start.\" As much as I love sarcasm, I don't appreciate it much in these sorts of situations. He earnestly cleans the table and makes sure that the table isn't wet but forgets to wipe my chair which is wet and to bring me new utensils and a water glass as all those items got soaked. I then have to ask for a new glass of water and some extra napkins to clean up and make myself comfortable again. Fun.

Okay, now the food. Two of my friends order the same dish as me. Our dish comes with a side of fruit. I noticed that my fruit bowl looks sparse in comparison to theirs. I realize I'm missing some apples, and normally I wouldn't mind but they already spilled water on me so I figure why not? I ask another server for some apple and he looks at me like I'm an asshole. He never comes back with the apple! Finally, I ask our main waitress and she does retrieve them - wow, was that so difficult? I dig into my food and it's barely warm. It was tasty but I'm pretty sure this dish was not supposed to be room temperature...unless Canadians just eat their Eggs Benedict that way. And so much for Eggs Benedict with poached eggs as my egg yolks were not runny."}
{"text":"Ouvert, il y a à peine quelques mois (été 2016), même formule déjeuners/brunchs que les 2 autres Universel (St-Denis & Peel), par contre celui-ci est plus vaste. Belle déco (j'ai bien aimé les luminaires), il y a aussi une terrasse extérieur sur Ste-Catherine. J'étais assis au bar sur l'heure du lunch pour un déjeuner tardif, assez occupé en salle, j'ai pris 2 oeufs/bacon (9,20$), même présentation et goût que sur St-Denis, un peu gras mais ça fait la job. Service rapide. Prix correct. Ouvert tous les jours de 7am à 23h.

4/5 visité en septembre 2016"}
{"text":"Great meal and atmosphere!

We wanted to start our day off right and you know that can only mean one thing: delicious brunch! This place did not disappoint.

The place was packed and we got seated on the second-to-last table available.

Excellent price to quality ratio. I can eat a lot and rarely leave a restaurant full but I did today. These guys are not stingy with their portions.

Quality is right up there with any other brunch I've been to. I had an omelette and it came complete with a healthy amount of fruit, bread, beans and potatoes. We threw in another plate of fruit and two smoothies, the latter being so fresh and so delicious.

Service was outstanding. Our waiter was super friendly, patient and informative.

Would definitely be back next time I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Large breakfast menu from eggs benedict, omelettes, waffles, crepes, french toast, to classic 2-egg breakfasts. Generous portions of sliced fruits and home fries, and they even have fresh-squeezed orange juice. One less star because we were seated in the front of the restaurant, and the draft from the windows was pretty bad (it was 18 degrees and raining outside)."}
{"text":"The blending machine was very noisy, ruining a bit the breakfast experience on a supposedly quiet Saturday morning. The food is decent but not extraordinary, very typical dish choices and fair enough portions. A bit overpriced for certain very plain dishes like oatmeal."}
{"text":"I tried brunch today. It was good. The service was pretty nice. But nothing too special or out of expectation."}
{"text":"My first time there was a while ago and I wasn't impressed so I decided to give it another chance and try their Eggs Benedict.

Their portions are big and very generous on potatoes and sauce and the service is good and that's about all. 

I must say that Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast/brunch food and I consider myself somewhat an expert. The meal I had at Universel was less than average taste for me. The sauce tasted little bit too much on the butter and my plate had fingerprints all over it. 

This place is filled with tourists and people from other towns/regions of Quebec and quite popular even on the weekdays so it can get quite busy. It's certainly not the worst breakfast place, but not the good one either. There are better places in Plateau for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on a Sunday before driving back to NYC and it was amazing. The service was great and the food was amazing. There was bit of a wait but we were seated after 15 minutes. The portions are huge! And the espressos are"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast!! So yummy! Had the big breakfast and it was amazing! Coffee was American style and the best I've had since visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"My Hubby & I have been to this restaurant twice. We like it but we've also had our issues. Our first experience wasn't bad, we went for lunch on a Friday. It was busy and we had to wait for our meals for a while, but it was okay.

Our second visit on a Thursday for dinner was interesting. Our waiter was super cool but here's what happened. Essentially, our cool waiter took our order. We asked for an appetizer, a House salad, and the main meal. The waiter asked us if we wanted the appetizer & salad together or separate (ie. wait 10-15 minutes before bringing the second course). We specifically asked that they be brought separately. So, after some time the waiter brought us the appetizer. Then, like 5 minutes later, another guy brings us our salads! We're both like \"Well ok, but that was quick....\". We had barely started on the appetizer! The guy, who later turned to be the Manager, said he'll hold our main courses. Ok, that seemed fine, only that from finishing our salads to receiving the main course passed 40 minutes. My Husband went to the bar and spoke to someone about it and at that point we still didn't have our main course. It was around this time that we both started losing our appetite completely. Finally, we got our meals and the Manager (the guy who brought our salads prematurely), came to the table to talk to us. 

In the end we were compensated for the error, but my Husband's steak was not cooked right either. He asked for Medium-Rare and the steak was clearly Well-Done and too dry. 

We think the Manager, with the good intention of trying to help, failed to communicate with our waiter who actually took our orders. The waiter knew that we wanted the courses to be spread out, but we saw the Manager bringing out not only our salads but other people's orders as well... The same thing might have happened to another table because he was serving too quickly. 

We're not sure if we will return. We still tipped our waiter fairly because it wasn't really his fault and as I said above, he was very cool."}
{"text":"It's ok. I'm giving it three stars because the hostess and waitress were semi rude. The busser was extremely nice and he was very helpful in getting the waitress to actually take my order. The food was ok, the best thing about it was it was really fast so you're day can begin without much delay here. I had a strawberry mimosa, Three cheese omelet and  a side of sausage."}
{"text":"Good but not the best
I went there once but I wouldn't recommend it for a visitor!! 
There's so many great restaurants in Montreal needed to be discovered 
I liked the place the decorations , l could not finish my plate cause the size of the meal are really large!! And the good thing though is that you can order half of the size !! also the service is good and fast."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with a couple of people. The restaurant is downtown on rue Peel, so the location is pretty convenient. Everyone was polite, except for the waiter. I have several food allergies so I tried to explain that I only wanted the fruit plate with nothing else (no cottage cheese, no bread), and he gave me a very hard time. He insisted that if I didn't want the bread or cottage cheese then I'd only be able to get a fruit bowl, not the fruit plate. In my opinion, that made absolutely no sense because I just wanted the fruit plate with only fruit. Anyway, in the end he finally accommodated my request. I was pretty disappointed because a lot of people have allergies nowadays and they should be accommodated whenever possible. You can't really mess up fruit, so my food was good. Unfortunately, the waiter was so horrible that the food didn't make up for it."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and loved it. I can't give it 5 stars because some of the servers were not that friendly. They seated me within 5 minutes on a crowded Labor Day, but once seated it took about 10 minutes for us to even get the menus despite several of the servers passing by my table. With that said, the food was delicious. I had the Universel for lunch which is a perfectly poached egg, bacon on a bagel. that came with home fries and a side of fruit. The ambiance was nice - they have outdoor seating. This appears to be a trendy place, but the prices were reasonable. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Overwhelmingly average in every regard.  The service was okay, the food was okay, the ambiance was okay. 

A large menu with a variety of options, and the portions were rather large. However, the taste of the food was nothing special. I ordered the universal omelette and my husband ordered the universal breakfast. Neither dish blew us away. 

The tables are also very close together, so when another party took the table next to ours, it was very distracting because of the small space between us. 

Also, it was a little overpriced."}
{"text":"Terrific food, wide ranging menu, good service, and little to no pricing shock.  So glad we wandered in by chance."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch and great service! My favorite brunch place in Montreal. It's not that expensive, and it's very fast in addition to the food being great. Plus they have this amazing half and half combo option if you can decide if you want eggs or a crepe/waffle."}
{"text":"Amazing place to stop in for breakfast and brunch! My boyfriend and I were looking for a place for a quick bite to eat and I am so happy I found this restaurant. Awesome atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! The service and food was amazing! The portions are quite large so beware when you are ordering."}
{"text":"Si vous avez une faim de loup, vous êtes à la bonne place ! Assiette ultra généreuse :) Rôtis, toasts et café ont accompagné mes 2 oeufs et 2 crèpes. 
On n'est pas sur une qualité et un gout inoubliable, loin de là, mais ça passe très bien pour un lendemain de veille !"}
{"text":"I've walked by this place a few times, and finally tried it (for breakfast). The establishment has a pretty full menu, but it seems that they serve breakfast practically all day (we went there at 2pm). All things considered, the food was absolutely delicious, and the portions were very hearty (neither of us finished our entire meals); we got the smoked salmon eggs benedict, and the chicken and eggs. While a bit pricey, it's a rather cool experience, albeit, a tad busy. The servers, however, are nice and courteous. I have my doubts about the light fixtures (a bit gaudy), but the food is what counts. The juice is pretty tasty to boot! A place worth visiting, at least once!"}
{"text":"I am sorry but yes I experienced much-much better and I am not talking about fancy places like L'avenue but standard good places like beauty for example. 
The place looks fancy and charges like its a fancy place( between $$ and $$$) but  I have no idea why they stopped there and didnt bring the food to a fancy level as well. 
I ordered one of the omelets and like previous reviews my meal was very dry. Both the omelet and potatoes were over cooked (extremely dry) my friends at the table also complained their stuff was too dry. They forgot to bring us stuff (like coffee, butter etc) and worst of all we kept hearing shutting from the kitchen. Overall not an amazing experience food -wise and atmosphere wise."}
{"text":"Très bon brunch mais beaucoup de monde.
Les assiettes sont très copieuses et la localisation très appréciée.
Mais un peu d'attente pour le placement car aucun placement n'est possible si le groupe n'est pas au complet même pour 4 personnes. Il me semble que le restaurant est un peu sombre."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Very nice place. I went for a run and was on my running clothes and yet was welcomed all the same. Friendly, efficient, great food. loved it."}
{"text":"They serve your standard diner-style food. We ate breakfast here and found the portions to be huge. I noticed that was a common theme in Montreal though. Everything was pretty standard. Nothing stood out either as being above the pack. My only complaint is that their breakfast sausage is very bland for breakfast sausage. It was greasy and fatty but still bland somehow. Other than that, the food wasn't bad. The inside of the restaurant was nicer than I expected too."}
{"text":"Summary: Great atmosphere, good service and okay food. 

I had the combination eggs Benedict which was as straight forward as a Benedict gets. It came with potatoes and fruit. That and a mimosa was $26. My friend got the universal breakfast that came with 2 eggs, 2 large crepes, potatoes, bacon, beans, some weird pate of some sort and bread. She also got a waffle. That and orange juice totaled about $36. The hollandaise sauce on my benefit was pretty plain so I did use a lot of salt, and my friend said her crepes were too rubbery and heavy. Even though the food was okay, I would definitely come back and try something else on their menu. Our waitress was very nice and the place was very busy with a fun, modern feel."}
{"text":"Insane how busy this place is on the weekends but for good reason. We arrived half an hour late to or reservations and despite telling us we would have to wait in line we were surprised to only wait 5 minutes or so for a table for six.

This was one of the best brunch places I've been to in years. The prices were slightly higher than I would've liked but quality of homemade comfort breakfast food was phenomenal. Make sure to order dishes with a cup of fruit or get an add on because everything was super sweet and fresh. The orange juice wasn't worth it. But the rest of the food was amazing. I ordered a smoked salmon eggs benedict which came with a cup of fruit and potatoes. The potatoes were awesome, perfectly fried to a crispy exterior with a soft interior. The hollandaise sauce was tasty but subtle and the poached eggs were perfectly done.

Friends got universal breakfast which was well worth it and even without a cup of fruit had some fruit to munch on on the side. Everything was just done to perfection and as one of the few places that takes reservations this is a must go."}
{"text":"En fin de semaine mon chum m'a demandé si je voulais aller manger des gaufres de la fromagerie de notre quartier. Je lui ai dit que non, j'avais le goût d'un déjeuner un peu plus soutenant que ça. On s'est donc retrouvé à Universel où j'ai commandé...une gaufre!

Mon chum quant à lui a demandé le gros déjeuner qui inclut un peu de tout. J'ai goûté à ses patates, les fèves au lard et le pain doré. Tout était très bon, surtout le sirop d'érable qui vient en grosse bouteille sur la table, sans avoir à payer d'extra. Le sirop allait aussi à merveille avec ma gaufre garnie de bananes et fraises.

L'ambiance était festive avec un bon mix des tops musique années 80 et début 90 qui nous a mis de bonne humeur, même avec la « gaffe de fille » que j'avais fait ce matin là. Le service était bien et chaleureux, mais il a fallu qu'on demande pour notre réchaud de café parce qu'on ne venait pas nous voir souvent.

Somme toute, une bonne expérience, un endroit à revisiter, possiblement avec un grand groupe."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic breakfast at Universel! Came by with three friends on a Sunday morning and didn't even have to wait! 

I was so excited about my food I couldn't even remember to take a photo- so unlike me. I got the bacon eggs benedict (my weakness) and I've never had eggs benedict come with cheese on it and it was surprisingly lovely! They also make a GREAT hollandaise. 

Their breakfast potatoes were so good that they deserve their own paragraph! Seriously, they were life changing. They didn't even need ketchup! They were so crisp and so well seasoned. 

The food came out incredibly quickly and definitely fresh! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Typical brunch place that is a bit overrated. It has the same brunch food as anywhere else but always seem to be packed! By no means is it bad but the service is very slow since it's always packed. Our waiter took nearly 20 minutes just to notice us and take our order. I got the smoked salmon eggs benny and the yolk was perfect but I could barely taste the salmon.  The fruits wasn't sour but the eggs were lukewarm and there wasn't anything particulary outstanding about it. But for people who love a filling brunch--universel is where it's at! They load the plate with lots of food but you also end up paying a bit more than other brunch places, but it's a nice, bright place that serves up filling your tummy :)"}
{"text":"Solid four stars. 
Quick and friendly service.  Great breakfast variety, and large portion.  I really like the display of fresh fruit that came with each dish.  The coffee was so fresh and hot.  No rush attitude.  I had the specialty universal omelette with large amounts of meats.  Very good.  Maybe next time I can get s table outside!!!"}
{"text":"Good local joint for good local food , the tables are a little too close to the neighbors but it makes it fun , u can enjoy you're meal while u Ease drop next table over or people watch ...the servers are nice and friendly food was a bit cold but still tasty 3  stars for the cold food ,,, 4 stars for the staff n service ..."}
{"text":"At the advice of a local I had met earlier in my travels, I came here for breakfast.  It was the last day of my vacation, and I was determined to end it on a high note.
     They had predicted rain, so the buildings \"rain attire\" was on. (the roof pulled out, and their plastic windows were up and attached. I'd have preferred it open, but I can't control the weather, or people's predictions of it. But regardless, we asked to be seated outside, and we were seated outside.  It was pretty empty outside. there were only two or three tables being used (including our own.) 
     After perusing the menu I settled upon the \"Mexican breakfast\" but asked if I could not get guacamole. I also ordered \"L'Asteroide\" which ended up being a berry smoothie. My friends ordered their regular healthy fare. 
     Before too long our food arrived. My Mexican breakfast wasn't very Mexican, but it was very delicious. L'Asteroide smoothie was also delicious. Several berry flavors danced on my palate before sliding down to my belly.
     Waitress was great, hostess was great, place was very clean, and everybody was great.   I'll definitely be back. 

           After this place, I went back to the hotel, packed up my stuff and left Montreal.
     This was a nice place to end my vacation."}
{"text":"Wow ! Great place to get authentic French food! Everything is fresh and delicious! We ate breakfast here back to back!"}
{"text":"Sorry Yelpers, but you didn't find us a good place this time.  We came here for breakfast, and fortunately it wasn't busy and our group was seated promptly.

For drinks, most of us ordered tea as it was cold outside.  Of the 5 of us, only 1 had hot water. The rest of us had luke warm to cold, making it impossible for tea.  When I asked for a refill of the hot water, it was still lukewarm.  Apparently tea is not a popular drink, or they would know that it's hot water we need (kettle anyone?).

Our server was abrupt with us, and perhaps she already had a bad morning.  The food was a bit pricey for breakfast, and I guess I must have ordered the wrong thing... ham and eggs with potatoes were just ok.  

Giving this 3 \"A OK\" stars. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't \"OMG good\".  With so many other places in Montreal, this place can do better."}
{"text":"Pigged out with some friends here a few weeks ago and forgot to review it. I ordered eggs over-easy with french toast and bacon and orange juice. Everything was delicious. I especially liked the french toast and the freshly squeezed  orange juice. Great service and the dishes were delivered promptly to our table considering the massive amount of food we ordered. Will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Montreal is full of great places to eat, but it's downtown core is not an area of town that benefits from regal restaurants. Universal Breakfast will hit the spot for any tourists wondering downtown. Certainly it does the job, but there's nothing here worthy of an Instagram post."}
{"text":"Make sure you come here for Happy Hour!!!! We stayed at the neighboring Hotel Omni and had the best  French onion soup and escargot. Service by Ann was pleasant and efficient! The vibe is hip and trendy and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is usually a go-to brunch spot for my friends and I due to its central location and average service and food. However, today we received the slowest and crappiest service! First they bring water for my two other friends but not myself. Then my fries were served unseasoned, greasy, completely cold, and without the chipotle mayo as described. My friend's crepe has to be returned because they made the wrong order. Another friend's breakfast was served without toast. To none of these they even offer an apology. I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"You're in the hottest club in Montreal and it's a little past 3. Music and people fight for your attention and maybe you've lost track of time. Or maybe you're hanging on, fogged by a drink too many, to the hopes you won't have to go home alone. But the club's gotten your money and has tired of you, and let's you know by the sudden silence and the blinding brightness of the lights turning on for the first time. As your eyes struggle to adjust, you start wondering wether the underlit atmosphere was intended for seduction or rather as a cover up for the slough of sugared alcohol across the scuffed surface of the dance floor. Or to veil the stained and threadbare bar stools you sat on sipping on your twenty dollar cocktails? The seduction, if there was any, was to distract from how much you'd be willing to spend in a mostly empty warehouse space furnished with plastic furniture with \"final sale\" labels still stuck on them. 

But now what if instead of showing you the door, the club offers you a seat at one of these plastic tables and graciously serves you hot coffee, salty scrambled eggs, and charred crisp bacon?

Welcome to Universel Déjeuner & Grillades 

I'll forever question the plexiglass and lime coloured, 'here comes Y2K' late 90's lounge decor, but undeniably the place is dedicated to fast, affordable, and satisfying breakfast. I want to snark about Crescent street vampires deserving breakfast too but I'll refrain. Because we are on Peel street right now.   

The menu is standard breakfast diner fare made with effort: omelettes, eggs + meat combos, and various Benedicts. I mention the effort because while despite appearing pedestrian originality-wise, almost all big breakfast chains in the downtown area serving similar options seem to have been deflated by curated brunch spots and at this point deserve applause for managing to find a link between sliced bread and a toaster. L'Universel can not only manage toast, but they offer pumpernickel at no extra charge too. 

Effort shows up in other ways. The beverage runners have a sixth sense about when your coffee's meniscus drops below two-thirds, always arriving no later to offer yet another refill. Waiters dance on a line somewhere between chatty friendly-ness and robotic efficiency I never knew existed. Every step of the restaurant/client process is timely without ever making you feel rushed. There's free WiFi. There's a giant plexiglass windowed wine rack. 

Don't fooled by the dimly lit pictures uploaded here, but otherwise thumbs-up emoji. Universel Déjeuner & Grillades is an ersatz club with real breakfast chops."}
{"text":"Hostess sat my guest and I down. Then for the next 15 minutes we sat without anyone ever coming to say hi or offer us anything. I understand restaurants can be busy at brunch time, but acknowledging your customers is the lowest bar of service to clear. 

We left."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service. They were able to seat our party of 10 within 15 minutes on a busy Sunday. Fresh fruit with every meal. Fabulous all around!  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The eggs Benedict are the bomb. Downsides, cluttered and crowded."}
{"text":"Shared a chicken club sandwich with my daughter. It was good and the quantity of food was definitely sufficient. My daughter absolutely loved the onion rings and the staff was very nice to her. I got to watch a bit of World Cup soccer on the TV screens while eating and sipping on coffee. Happy with the visit."}
{"text":"As crowded as it was on a busy Saturday morning, we got our seats right away! Our server came immediately as we sat down and took our order. And the food.. Oh boy! It blew me away. We had waffles and egg benedicts! D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S! I would definitely come back here when I come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"We chose Universel based on other yelper reviews and even then, it exceeded our expectations. We were in Montreal just for the weekend, visiting McGill with our high school junior and 12 yr old brother in tow. The entire family was delighted with this pick for brunch.  The florentine eggs Benedict, the omelettes and \"les combos\" with crepes/waffles and strawberries, bananas and chocolate were all both visually appealing and delicious.  The overly generous servings all cane with fresh delicious fruit (kiwi, pineapple included - not just your typically boring fruit salad!)   Service was terrific and we really enjoyed the atmosphere - crowded, tight tables, good background music, good selection of newspapers and an eclectic group of people moving in and really gave the place a local distinctive flavor. We would definitely recommend. 

Meals were on average $10; speciality coffees could push bill up a little but well worth it ( great cafe au lait!).  Overall terrific value. Would visit again."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Loved the food! Loved the terrace! Sit out there and people watch and immerse yourself in Montréal life. Loved the service! Just all around amazing food and customer service.  The breakfast was so good. Unlimited coffee and just so much food. The eggs (any way you want them) crepes, waffles, sausages, potatoes, baked beans, fruit, and the warm pumpernickel bread with butter, just wondeful!!! You can eat here and not feel hungry for hours. This establishment is very clean. I wish it was in NYC. I'd go here everyday! I would recommend and glady return when in Montréal again."}
{"text":"Super chill place to eat really nice guys good food and good desserts with a good atmosphere"}
{"text":"The food was good, there were a ton of options.  I went there because the menu literally has everything you ever want, breakfast or lunch.  Almost too many options! 

The only complaint I have is the ambiance, it's way too crowded and kinda crazy.  This is not really the place for a relaxing quiet brunch.  But food is good!"}
{"text":"Happy hour? Check. Plenty of seating? Check. Friendly staff? Check. No reservation required at 6-ish on a Friday night?  Check.

Tried to go for an early dinner elsewhere last night and the original place (which wasn't fancy) couldn't accommodate us. So, we walked around the corner, spotted Universel and hit the jackpot.

The unexpected happy hour started us off just right! Two for one for beer, wine, sangria and martinis! Since we had already had a little adult beverage in our system, we only took advantage of a single round (of two!). But the drinks were delicious and just the right size.

We decided to order poutine to absorb some of the aforementioned alcohol...plus...how can we possibly be in Canada and NOT have poutine at least once? It was also just the right portion and made the way poutine should be...saucy and cheese curd-y.

To \"balance\" things out, we each had salads. I loved my garden salad with a perfectly undercooked (as ordered) piece of salmon. The dressing was a light and slightly sweet balsamic berry concoction that was not glopped on the mixed greens. Rave reviews on the Greek salad with grilled chicken....the only issue was that some of the chicken was a little dry.

Great staff...lots of smiles. The desserts looked excellent as well. It looks like you could stop in here and just have drinks and dessert....or just dessert and no drinks.... or have it all."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday at 8 am, only a few others were there and we got to pick where we sat. Started to become more packed as time went on so we definitely made the right call getting there early. Our waitress was good enough, nothing special but checked on us multiple times and we were offered coffee refills. Our coffee and food came out pretty quickly. I got the bacon eggs Benedict and I'd have to say it was probably one of the best I've ever had... the hollandaise sauce is very good. Fairly large portions with fresh fruit as well as home fries that were good and not too greasy. Overall I'd say it was above average and I would definitely consider going back during my next visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is busy....  breakfast was not impressive at all! Eggs Benedict on a soggy cold English muffin, over cooked cold eggs, undercooked asparagus. Couldn't drink my latte..."}
{"text":"Good service. Waited for 20 mins to be seated for brunch. Busy on Saturdays and Sunday's. Food was good. I had the bacon eggs Benedict. It was good. Friends had universel breakfast and enjoyed that as well."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. 

Huge menu, good food and decent prices. 

Sat at the bar. The staff is terrific."}
{"text":"Not my fave spot. Service was hit and miss. The food was mediocre. Nothing special. I guess it's okay for just grabbing something on the go, but wouldn't go back to sit and eat again. Service was slow, hard to get water refilled, and the food tasted very basic. Nothing interesting."}
{"text":"Universel is a classic Montreal brunch spot I never get sick of. Their menu isn't particularly creative compared to other brunch places in MTL, but it is definitely a safe bet. It's quite busy on the weekends so it's best to try and go early to avoid waiting.

Their eggs benny selection is extensive and very popular. I love getting a salty and sweet combo at breakfast, so to get the best of every world I have hacked the menu. Universel Breakfast--your choice of meat, sweet treat (waffles, french toast, or crepes), eggs, and hashbrowns). Here's the trick, get your eggs poached, english muffin as the toast, and a side of hollandaise--eggs benny plus!"}
{"text":"The food was salty here; the potatoes, the eggs, the meats all salty. The crepes were chewy. Just an average place with a pricy tag. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, service was great, milkshake was not so great since they didn't add any ice to it and it came to me lukewarm (I took ice from my ice water and all was good with the world again).

Location is nice, but you should seriously consider redesigning your sign/logo outside. It makes your restaurant feel cheap and not worth going inside, but as soon as we went inside we were pleasantly surprised by the decor."}
{"text":"I've been here tons of times because the location works out well for my friends. Don't go without a reservation.

Food: average brunch food I think. Eggs Benedict is the most common order and for good reason - it's done fairly well.

Service: slow, mostly because it's always packed at brunch. There are always hoards of people waiting near the entrance which makes it cramped and painful to wait for a table. Even with a reservation, they won't seat your party of 9/10 until your 10th arrives which is annoying.

Price: average brunch price. Not much to say here.

Ambiance: loud and lively you could say. Not great for a detailed one on one conversation but acceptable for a get together with friends."}
