{"text":"As I entered the place  I checked out their food displayed were all covered. In order to see the food, I have asked the male attendant to open and asked what dish was in there. He complied and I asked how much was that dish, he did not even replied. I have asked him again what other food there is. He replied that everything was labelled then turned his back on me without excusing himself. I was left there  wondering if he will still tend to me. Decided to leave as I don't think I am welcome in that place.   I have bought food there last 12 months ago. Bought about three dishes that cost me about $50. Food was not worth the price. I am not a good cook but I think  my cooking could be the same taste as their food selections. Bad service with food too pricey for the taste and quality. Shabby place to eat."}
{"text":"The poorest quality of food I've ever had. Whatever we bought from this brand is just disappointing. We tried a couple of times thinking we just had some bad choices with our first bulk. The \"hopia baboy\" tasted like raw flour. The \"adobong mani\" are not fully cooked! The rest of what we got are all poor quality and we never recommend this brand to be bought. They cut corners on ingredients and procedure. Like Filipinos can adapt to a sloppy quality since we have few choices here. Pathetic mindset!"}
{"text":"Is this place ever open.  Terrible service.  Food is average.  Unprofessional and very slow service."}
{"text":"I ordered take out dishes( kaldereta, bopis, ginataang langka, and Bicol express) but they're all taste awful.. And it all end up in garbage.. I never gonna order here again!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for Filipino food.  Some dishes are hit and miss but generally if you know what to order you'll be satisfied.  They are now open for dining."}
