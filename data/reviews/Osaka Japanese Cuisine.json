{"text":"Terrible first impression before we even parked. Outside on the bushes beside the restaurant were cleaning rags laying out to dry. Once inside we noticed they were the same rags that were being used to clean the tables. The water tasted nasty and the sushi wasn't that great either."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere as well as the cordial and efficient waitress. The good was quite decent with soy sauce and my compatriots enjoyed the food and time spent there."}
{"text":"Great Sushi! Freshly made! It was delivered super fast and is also perfectly affordable. I recommend the specials menu, it offers almost 40 choices all half price from $1.9 to $4 per roll.  Sushi rolls plus the yummy sauce made a super fresh tasting and blessed lunch for me.  I will come back again"}
{"text":"If you want a lot of sushi for a moderate amount of money in the Matthews area, you are in luck! My family and I come here frequently and love the Kiss Me Roll, Fiesta Roll, and the California Roll. If you are not a sushi person go for the Chicken fried rice (with extra sauce just trust me;). The service is slower than average and the ambiance is not much to see, but the food is still pretty good."}
{"text":"We came here on our anniversary looking for American style sushi rolls and we were not disappointed. After a year of nigiri in Japan, a girl just needs some kind of ludicrous fried and eel sauce laden roll, you know? :)

We ordered a spider roll, a tempura shrimp roll topped with eel and avocado, a fried roll wrapped in another roll, and a spicy tuna roll, and I tried to get a salmon skin roll but they were out. They were huge! The fried components were nice and crunchy, and there was a nice mound of undyed pickled ginger on our dish, which is always a plus.

The green tea they serve was the nice toasty tasting kind with the rice.

While we were waiting they brought out two free apps for us, a heart shaped rice patty topped with something (I didn't catch what he said, but it was good), and a flaming plate (!) with a scallop shell filled with cheesy crab and seafood. Amazing, and they didn't even know it was our anniversary, although my SO accused me of telling them when he got back from washing his hands and the dishes were on the table."}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Hibachi and it was really good.  The flavor was just right and the portion was enough that I still had to take some home.  The side carrots were sweet and tasted like canned carrots (that was the only negative) the dish itself came with fresh vegetables too, so I was a little surprised with the side of carrots.  HOWEVER, we will come back"}
{"text":"I refuse to eat here.Ive tried it twice. once when it opened. And once few days ago. And I got sick both times.The fish is not fresh. and they dont even try to keep it coold. I dont recommend this place at all. Very dissapointing because this place would be really convenient for when i'm craving sushi. I'll keep driving to Neko at south Blv."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for hibachi do not come here!! Food was bland and yum yum sauce was watery. Waiter was nice but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Osaki at least four times and I've always had wonderful food and great service!"}
{"text":"I used to love the place under the previous owners.  The only negative was that it would take longer to get the check after you were done than it would to order and eat the food.  I went last night and the food was definitely inferior and the waitress was clueless.  I'll give them another shot since it was a favorite of mine for years, but I'm highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Having spent seven years in Japan I found this place to be anything but authentic. The staff were courteous, but also not very attentive. The sushi was definitely not fresh and the assembly and presentation were lacking appeal. Operators should be careful when selecting restaurant names and not have the ability to live up to them. I will keep looking for an authentic Japanese restaurant with authentic and more traditional cuisine."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place!  We decided to go here on a whim, and now we can't stop going back.  The service is prompt, courteous, and upbeat - thanks Andrew!  The food has always been consistently delicious.  And the icing on the cake?  Their prices are great."}
{"text":"Terrible. Ordered the sushi for two and ate nothing . Salmon was still frozen.Told the waitress the food was terrible and she laughed and asked us if we were full. Really?"}
{"text":"God father roll is so good ! Sushi is super fresh and it's my favorite place for Japanese food"}
{"text":"Sushi here is ok - not the freshest, but not bad either.  You get a lot of food for your money.  The Hibachi leaves much to be desired - I've never had shrimp sauce that tastes like pure mayo!  Service here sucks - my husband is severely allergic to shellfish and the waitress and the sushi chef refused to remake his food after putting it on the same plate with crab.  Won't be coming back here ever again!"}
{"text":"I wanted to order take out for my daughter and I but was told no to to-go orders for children. I understand people probably try to take advantage of kids meals everywhere but she was with me. I cannot support a business who has such a ridiculous no exception policy. My 8 year old daughter would like to eat too!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a little strip mall, this popular restaurant even has a nice outdoor patio.  The service is outstanding, especially to those that are new to the sushi experience. Highly recommend the Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Spicy Salmon Roll."}
{"text":"My friends and I were really impressed by the freshness and taste of Osaka's sushi.  We ordered the appetizer sashimi (big enough as a single entree), seaweed salad (a generous amount was served), the tuna trio (delicious), and the usual rainbow roll which did not disappoint either.  The service was great and very attentive, they were even nice enough to give us some free appetizers.  Def a great place for sushi, the prices were def reasonable.. going to go back soon!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! The servers are always so nice. We love the crispy salmon roll sushi and steak hibachi. If they are not busy they'll even bring out some amazing appetizers on the house for your table."}
{"text":"Friendly, attentive service, and decent quality fish (for Charlotte - not exactly the ideal supply source for sushi grade fish). Good presentation, adequate portion sizes."}
{"text":"The food wasn't as good as it used to be a few years ago. The quality is decreasing in some foods like the tempura. The one a few years ago was traditional, but now the alternate is not as good as it used to be. So I have to go to like Sushiya to get some better quality food."}
{"text":"Such a great find in Matthews/Mint Hill. The sushi is always fresh. My favorite is the Alaska Roll with salmon, cream cheese and avocado. They also have the best hibachi veggies I have found anywhere. Everything is seasoned really well. The service is always great, and the owners are very kind. They have great lunch and sushi deals during the week as well so it doesn't break the bank. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect the outskirts of Charlotte to have an awesome sushi place but lo and behold, Osaka is the place. 

Unlike your typical Japanese cuisine, Osaka is your hole-in-a-wall type of restaurant, it isn't fancy and doesn't have much of an atmosphere, but who cares?! The sushi here is GREAT for the price you pay, PLUS Osaka probably has one of the fresher selections and quality sushi/sashimi in Charlotte. I don't care for much of the hibachi items at any Japanese restaurant so I never tried theirs but it just looks like your typical hibachi you order anywhere. I've had no problems with service, staff is friendly and attentive. One of the main reasons why I LOVE Osaka is because the staff will throw in appetizers and little dishes on the house for customers to try. The extra effort Osaka shows to their customers sets Osaka above many places I've been to (hell I can't even recall many times where I got added-value items on the house, even at nice \"5-star\" restaurants).

I'm super picky when it comes to eating sushi, so trust me when I say Osaka is among the best when it comes to sushi in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Kudos to the Chefs and Staff!  Fish was fresh for all 6 items ordered.  If you like spicy, try the jalepeno roll.  We will be back again!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday night, my husband and 3 yr old.  After ordering our appetizer of fried tofu, which came fast and soooo delicious, they brought us two on-the-house appetizer samples (plenty to try) of their Fajita sushi and Firefish.  Both were awesome and we'll definitely return for.  Wedidn't come for sushi and I had chicken Yaki Udon, husband had teriyaki, and daughter had shrimp plate and ate it all. I don't know why I hadn't been in before since I moved to Mint Hill 1 year ago."}
{"text":"This place is a little below mediocre, the staff was awkward like this was their first day on the job and forgot little things such as straws, appetizers and soups which add up to be a not so great experience. We also witnessed 2 awkward situations with other customers, 1 that stormed out because they were told the place closes in 15 minutes. The sushi was decent, the few pieces of hibachi steak were tiny and the smallest portion I've ever had, same goes for the scallops and the sweet carrots were way too sweet. Overall I probably won't ever go back there."}
{"text":"Awesome.  The sushi (especially the salmon) was good, tasted fresh, the lunch boxes come with a *ton* of food, and we were offered a couple of interesting specials on the house - tempura jalapeño and salmon skin rolls.  The boxes we ordered came with a hibachi item, and I got a delicious teriyaki steak, my mom got an equally tasty hibachi scallop.  Service was \"just okay\", our waitress seemed like kind of a noob. In a nutshell, to echo others, this is very good sushi at nasty sushi prices. Love it."}
{"text":"OK you guys, this place is a little out of the way but totally worth it.  The service is great, and the food is to die for.  I mean their sweet carrots alone are worth the trip, and if you're a sushi fan it's a definite must (try the Spider Rolls, scary name but worth the risk).  I recommend the Teriyaki Chicken myself, but everything on the menu is great.  Happy eating my friends!"}
{"text":"Great sushi! 

I've been to several sushi places around charlotte and this is the best I've come across yet. Not so much for the decorating and interior of the place, which honestly, isn't all that hot but because the food is just delicious. The group I went with shared 4 of their specialty rolls and everything about them was perfect from presentation to taste. Another thing to note is that they serve little complimentary apps before your meal so you start out with some free seafood salad as well as rice with a spicy sauce on top. These apps are very small portions but it's just one of those \"value added\" treats that a lot of places do not bother making the effort to do for the customers. We did also order some Edamame as a additional appetizers but I was a little let down on the portion size here. There must have been a uptick in the soybean market or something to cause them to have to cut back on their Edamame portions because usually places will load you up on these. But I digress. Anyways, if you are a sushi person this one is a \"must hit\" so be sure and give it a try."}
{"text":"After deciding to buy a new home while still owning one, I write my first Yelp review, after the very long and tedious wait. After a few months of being frugal, for once in my life, I told my wife it was time for our much needed date night. Of coarse she picked my favorite... sushi! I have to admit when she said lets just go somewhere local I was a little weary at first. If you read some of my earlier reviews, not only do I love sushi, but I can also be a bit over critical on sushi restaurants. I typically do not like your local downscale sushi joints. They tend to be, lets just say.... quantity over quality. I am really pleased to say that after the dinner I just had, I was completely 100% wrong. After my first few bits I looked at my wife and said \"I am going to Yelp the crap out of this place when we get home\".


At first sight, Osaka is certainly not eye opening place, but it is certainly a diamond in the rough. In this case, great food and service in a small, older strip mall. We were definitely well greeted and well treated from the start. The restaurant wasn't super busy but it did have a good amount of people there. We sat at the sushi bar and all of the wait staff served us throughout the night. I miss that type of service from restaurants when all of the servers work as a team. The sushi chefs were extremely pleasant and were very talented as well. 

As soon as I started seeing the sushi coming out, it made me start to rethink my position about the food. It appeared to be quality and quantity. As usual I ordered a bunch of different rolls and appetizers. They also sent us out a couple of appetizers on the house for us to try out as well. They gave us a tuna carpaccio and a crab salad app that were both to die for. The crab salad came out on fire as very aesthetically pleasing. We also got their volcano roll, tuna trio, the godfather roll and the kiss roll. All of them not only looked amazing but also tasted out of this world. I completely loved all of them. I am not a huge fan of cream cheese in my sushi so I was only able to eat a couple pieces of the godfather but it was really good. The one huge kicker about all of the amazing sushi is that pretty much all of their rolls are under $10. That quality of food, specially for seafood is almost unheard of.


Ultimately, I was happy my wife picked Osaka. I am also glad that I broke the local sushi bar stereotype as well. Certainly, I am excited that we found such a great sushi restaurant near our new house. Definitely give it a try if your east of the city one day."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a Groupon and I was pleasantly surprised, the waiter was helpful and courteous. The food portions were pretty good and to food tasted fresh. We had the steak and shrimp and the tempura appetizer. The prices very reasonable too."}
{"text":"Yet another solid sushi joint in the Charlotte area. It is technically in Matthews but it is basically in Mint Hill.I went here on a rainy week day when New Zealand Cafe had a long wait. The service was great. The shrimp tempura appetizer was good as was the spring rolls. My ginger dressing on  my ginger salad tasted kind of funny and wasn't good. I got the 16 piece sashimi with sushi platter. I was disappointed you only got 4 types of sashimi and would have liked to see more variety. The fish was great quality. My friend enjoyed his spider roll and california roll. I would say third best in the area after New Zealand Cafe and Room 112."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to check out this place for a long time now and are happy we finally made our way here.  We started with the house salad with ginger dressing. The dressing was definitely house made. It was tangy and citrusy and very good. We even received a complimentary radish roll...that was a nice surprise. 

We tried 4 different rolls and all of them were very good. The service was the best part. We pared ways with our previous go-to sushi bar because the service had take a decline, so this was a refreshing surprise. 

We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots! The sushi is very good and half price during lunch hours. Shawn is our favorite waiter but all the wait staff us very efficient. It's easy to get in and out in under an hour if you're on the clock. Osaka has been here at this location for many years which is a testament to its good food. There is outdoor seating as well which makes dining especially nice in mild weather."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi is an excellent value. The wait staff was great and the food was even better. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this out and realized what amazing quality is just down the street from us! Definitely a hidden gem in Matthews / Mint Hill! We had sushi and hibachi and both were great. The prices are phenomenal, we will come again for dine in and take out. Clean and very friendly! Well done."}
{"text":"It is truthfully a 3.5 but I am rounding down to a 3. The food itself is a 4, the service was also a four, but the interior of the place drags the overall impression down to a 3. Interior is dated and it looks like the grimy and worn out carpet should have been replaced about 10 years ago. But, I would still go back because the sushi is very good and the waiter was knowledgable and friendly. But don't go there for a special occasion or if the furnishings are really  important to you. Nobody is going to be impressed with the layout, but anyone who likes sushi will like the food and the dinner prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I frequent Osaka for lunch. We typically call ahead to order. By the time we get to the location, our orders are ready. The hibachi menu is pretty cheap for lunch and the portion sizes are HUGE! I normally make 2 meals out of the $6 dish. Great deal, right?! I always get the Teriyaki Chicken with Mixed Vegetables. It comes with either fried or steamed rice. In case you were wondering, Teriyaki sauce is a little bit sweeter than Hibachi sauce. It depends on your preference, but I like the teriyaki sauce more.

Last time I went, the host informed me that they have a sushi special on Wednesdays (Dine-In only). I can't remember if he said Buy One Get One Free or Buy One Get One 50% Off. Either way, I'm tempted to come back to try the sushi (since the Hibachi dishes are pretty good)."}
{"text":"Yum! Tasty sushi with lots of options and quick service."}
{"text":"Love this place. We seem to be there once a week or so. Nothing overly fancy, just really good food. Spring rolls & the stuffed jalapeño appetizers are awesome. The miso soup is really good too! The sushi always rocks. We've taken down an ungodly number of Godfather rolls & crispy philly rolls. And for dessert, fried green tea ice cream. Always leave this place very full & very satisfied. Staff are super nice too. And at leas for this year, they're doing an all you can eat special, $20 (sometimes $15) a person, whole menu is all you can eat. The catch is if you order too much sushi & don't finish it, there's a penalty for each piece not eaten. So bring your appetite if you wanna try it out."}
{"text":"I don't go out to this area often, but got a recommendation to eat here from the nearby Toyota dealership. I'm happy that I was referred to Osaka!

It's a small, local restaurant that draws a casual crowd. The atmosphere was comfortable and the service was friendly. I ordered a few sushi rolls and they were really good. My husband got the fried tofu and in his words, \"It was DELICIOUS!\"

Next time we're in the neighborhood, we'll make this one of our stops!"}
{"text":"Osaka used to be one of our favorite places to get sushi but I've have to say that the place has gone downhill as of late. The rag used to clean the tables was sour. Needless to say, that smell doesn't go well with sushi. When I noticed the low sanitation grade, we almost left. I spotted the waiter coming with our apps. so we stayed but will prob. not be back. Too bad."}
{"text":"Went to Osaka for my birthday this year and I have been twice before I wasn't impressed but my family told me to go try it again so I took a leap and I'm glad I did. It was really good I started with the yakigyoza (fried dumplings) delish. Then I ordered the dinner combination hibachi steak and chicken which comes with fried rice, salad, mixed vegetables, sweet carrots, miso soup, and shrimp sauce on a huge plate everything was cooked perfect and tasted great. My friends got sushi, I didn't so I won't comment on it other than to say they enjoyed it and it was pretty. My drink glass did go empty for quite some time and I did have to ask for a refill as did my friends. I would only give service 2.5 stars, across the board it was a delightful evening."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a huge disappointment to me and my friend. I ordered the steak and chicken combination plate with a soup and salad. The onion soup tasted like wood and the salad hardly had any dressing on top. When ordering, the server never asked how I would like my steak prepared. To my dismay, the steak came out tougher than I would've ordered for myself. When I needed a refill of shrimp sauce, our server was nowhere to be found(???). We had to ask another server to bring us shrimp sauce and when our server later returned, he wreaked of cigarette smoke...not cool! Unfortunately, this review is about to get vulgar, my apologies :/ The next day, my gal friend and I both had a few green stools (poop). Icky! Overall, I was utterly disappointed with this establishment and did not feel it was worth the $15. I left the restaurant shaking my head :/"}
{"text":"I've tried Osaka a couple times now for dine in and take out. It's subpar at best. The shrimp sauce is good and food is just okay. I've ordered regular sushi and half priced lunch sushi, all times it's just been okay. Just an average Japanese place. Not really worth going back."}
{"text":"The rice is very good, the hibachi chicken on the other hand is very very dry. Disappointed because I can't seem to find a good hibachi place around Monroe/Matthews."}
{"text":"Absolutely DISGUSTING!!!!! I got the super crunch roll...I took  two bites and threw the rest away...so glad I used a gift card...The place stinks and the service sucks .   Run for the hills, NEVER EAT HERE if you like quality food!"}
{"text":"Meh.....It wasn't horrible but it wasn't good. Don't think I'll be back. Food was too salty for my taste. Service wasn't bad but wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"Not only is this place great quantity value for your money (especially on the super cheap lunch specials) but the food is high quality and delicious. The sushi, hibachi, and everything in between are all 10/10, and there's nothing on the whole list of appetizers that I haven't liked. Service is fast as well, and as long as the restaurant isn't packed and your party isn't enormous, you will frequently get your food before you've finished your soup and salad. Would recommend this to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"The first two times I wanted to have dinner at this restaurant I called and no one answered the phone ... no answering machine either. So I figured it was permanently closed. I called a third time and they were open! Not very far South East from where I Iive but it feels like it's in the middle of farmlands, well at night it does. Inside, surprise it a bona fide Japanese road house. Cool. It was a personal celebration and we went a little nuts ordering sashimi, nigiri and rolls : the dinner ran $150 for two but we took home enough to have a full lunch the next day. Plus the house offered us a number of complimentary samplings. 

Most of it was very good to excellent -with a couple of hiccups, like for example the yellow tail was still nearly frozen but overall it made for an excellent sushi house on the outskirts of Charlotte of all places. 

FYI no you can't get fresh fish in Charlotte nor in most other cities either. It HAS to be frozen first, but that doesn't make it bad. In Miami the charter sport fishing boats used top show up at local Japanese restaurants with fresh Wahoo, Mahi mahi and others, but they've over-fished the area to complete near complete extinction.
Welcome to the 21sts and enjoy it while you still can."}
{"text":"Sushi for two.  $54 or so....  Folks, this is a lot of food.  2 Salad, 2 soup, terryaki stir fry vegetable platter, tempura veg platter --- then a huge plate of assorted sushi and two rolls of your choice.  (check out my pic with my son)

The sushi is fresh, the cuts are extra large, the service is top notched - Need I say more!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Osaka twice. First visit the sushi was fine, but the green tea ice cream for dessert tasted like vomit. Tonight, I ordered Hibachi Teriyaki chicken. The fried rice was weird, unlike any I have ever had, just brown rice with lots of pepper in it. It looked so odd I had to ask the waiter what the black flecks were. The chicken was overcooked, as tough as old leather and the vegs looked wilted. I asked for another with the chicken not overcooked, but the replacement was just the same. My friend had some red snapper that she ordered grilled but she said it was fried. When I complained about the second chicken dish being overcooked too, the waiter only said, \"The kitchen did the best they could.\" If that's the best they can do, we will never go back."}
{"text":"They were very strict on all you can eat. They told me if I left some food on my plate the would penalize me by charging me more money on the things I didn't eat. It was  a very strict restaurant. I got the California role and shrimp tempura roll also the crunchy roll the sushi was average. But it was very strict I couldn't even give my friends a piece of the sushi."}
{"text":"Great for pigging out on sushi 11am to 3pm with their half price sushi special.  We order so many rolls we cant even count them because its so cheap.  Not that non Japanese people cant roll me some nice sushi but I like to see actual Japanese people preparing my food at a sushi place and this place has it.  Very spacious and nice staff.  You can seriously go to town on a ton of sushi and not pay more than $20 if you go during the half price time."}
{"text":"Osaka.... WOW what a joke of a restaurant! The food is mediocre for the price. Save your time, money & go somewhere that has a much better score, food & customer service!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi around! Me and my wife haven't been out in a while and were so impressed with service and selection! We went on a Monday and they had specials on sushi and sashimi.  Chef let us try a jalapeño and cream cheese roll (which now is what we are going back for) and it was Delish!  Loved everything! I had some Saki, which was reasonably priced. We got full on some gourmet sushi and then had a hibachi dish as entree. It comes with a creamy white sauce which is to die for! My wife loved that the Chef and staff said Hello so nicely to everyone walking in! We will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Just finished my flavorless hibachi steak entree.  I have a favorite sushi spot in town but they don't have the hibachi plate type I love to each (non-bento).  I sought Osaka out since it was close by and the photos look ideally good.  The staff greeted me and helped me with the menu for a takeout order.  There are special prices for sushi if you dine in.  My order seemed to be fine as I left.  The sushi (kani) was okay.  I like the two pieces that came with it which was like a bagel/fried style better.  I was thrown off wondering if I was charged for it.  No description about those pieces included from the menu.  A little pricey because I usually order Eel Avacado for the same price of $4.50 anywhere and it taste like a $6 roll.  The wasabi was REALLY fresh (moist) and made me question if other sushi spots use was REAL wasabi.  I chose hibachi steak as my single entree because that's usually the protein to order.  It was a helpful serving with sweet carrots and mixed veggies.  The steak and veggies were totally not seasoned.  Just cooked with oil and looked like pepper but no pepper flavor.  No smell of flavoring and quite a bit of water in my plate.  My cat who always stares and begs for food didn't want the piece of steak I gave him.  In fact, he sat down then left the sofa.  I absolutely loved the ginger sauce and would love it in my salad if I was to return.  There's a good hint of pineapple and orange in it!"}
{"text":"Always great service, great food, & a great price!!! What more could you ask for? For a special treat, sit at the sushi bar and watch the magic happen."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular customer but it seems like the sushi quality has gone downhill recently. The rice falls apart too easily when you try to pick each piece up with chop sticks and the crispy cali rolls aren't too crisp. The appetizers were great I just was not impressed with the sushi, which was a bummer...customer service was good though."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Mint Hill Mathews area with this exquisite sushi?! Shocked and thrilled. Meat to rice ratio is generous, prices are a dollar or two cheaper per roll than anyone else in town, GREAT specials, friendly staff, Do yourself and others and favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"Everything we have had here is really good!  You can't beat their lunch special for both sushi and hibachi. You always get a warm welcome when you walk in and the owners are very friendly. We love coming here and they are a welcomed spot in Mint Hill! 

Try the stuffed jalapenos, they are awesome!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that's a hidden secret in Matthews. Its right on the outskirts of Matthews right before you get to Mint Hill. This is an exceptional, authentic Japanese restaurant and the food is very good. The sushi is some of the best sushi in Charlotte and the service is always very good. Highly recommend this place for authentic Japanese food."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 5 stars because I loved the crazy salmon roll and my hibachi chicken was NOT dry.  Whoever the chef is, hats off to you!"}
{"text":"Sushi was on point. Fresh and specials are to die for. Definitely one of my better sushi experiences in Charlotte/Matthews area. general manager/sushi chef was very generous.

one downside: our order from the kitchen(hibachi) could use a bit of work. steak was chopped small and sauce was a bit off."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped for lunch here the other day.  We both are big sushi eaters and so we can be a little snobby when it comes to sushi.  Osaka is a nice little restaurant tucked into probably the wrong strip of stores--it should relocate to an area with better stores or more traffic.  Either way, really nice young guy sat us and was our waiter, very polite and brought us a crab tempura-like appetizer for free to try.  We ordered about six rolls and some sashimi and steamed dumplings. They have really unique rolls I must admit!  I've not had sushi with all the different little sauces they top the rolls with.  Fresh and well made, not too big, not too small.  We sat outside which was nice and quite.  I think we will add this spot to our sushi rotation."}
{"text":"We've been going here since it opened. We get take out as well as sitting down. Best Japanese food for the price in my opinion. We love this place."}
{"text":"So I've passed this place in Matthews many times but never actually got to try their food until his past weekend.  After running some Sunday errands, made our way over.  This place is a little tucked into the shopping center so you may not see the sign right away.  I still have fond memories of the drive through subway that used to be on the corner of the shopping center, but the Osaka shares the same building as Pizza Spigga which has been there forever as well.

Walk into a large restaurant space... sushi bar on the left and lots of tables on the right.  There's an outdoor seating area with a garden area (not just generic tables with umbrellas).  We were seated promptly (it was 5:30) but some tables were occupied.  One large group and a few scattered about.

Started with a godfather roll as an appetizer and my friend got a Miso soup.  The Godfather roll is indulgent:  tempura crab, cream cheese, alternating tuna and salmon on top, drizzled with aioli and a sauce.  The chicken hibachi (single) was awesome.  I'm used to just having carrots, but they give you zucchini and onions as well which is an added bonus in my book.  You could ask for extra sauce, but I'm a one saucer hibachi-goer... start dipping and then halfway through I pour the rest of the sauce on my remaining hibachi.

Overall, service was friendly and the food was even friendlier to the stomach.  If you leave hungry from this place, there might be something wrong (ask your doctor if you have a possible tapeworm)."}
{"text":"Having only ordered take out then this review is just for the food.  Big fan of the teriyaki steak/chicken.  Wife has tried the sushi and wasn't thrilled but said it wasn't bad.  Not much to choose in the area so just glad there is one close by to drive to.  Interior is a little bland and never seems busy so we'll probably stick to take out."}
{"text":"OK ... Did we just go to a totally different restaurant? This places was by far one of my worse experiences on Japanese \"cuisine\".
The sushi was OK, nothing out of the ordinary definitely not something that will bring me back to this place, the hibachi lunch was horrible, my chicken and veggies were swimming on oil, so was my husbands steak and shrimp and the \"fried rice\" was not fried rice at all it looked like rice cooked on beef broth for some color, needles to say I am suffering from the worse heartburn case I had in a few weeks.
 The service?..... we were rushed from the moment we walked in, so much so that we got our check before we got our lunch, right after our sushi roll, it took a while for the waitress to notice that we were still sitting and when she came to check she figured that we were still waiting for the food. She did apologize many times, but by then I was wishing I had canceled the order instead of receiving the hibachi.
I would not go back :( sorry. 
PS... I did like that wooden door, that was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I am not a sushi expert by any means - much of my experience comes from Krab sushi found on many buffets in the area.  And then there are places with things on their sushi that I am not really sure that I would like to eat if I knew what was on the plate, so it is not often that we go out seeking sushi.

But Osaka is a bit different - while they do have a focus on sushi, and it seems most go for the sushi, they also have other dishes (mostly noodles and hibachi items that you would find at your standard Japanese steakhouse).  In fact, they are one of the few places around town that will serve up udon, and unlike the soy-saturated udon noodles at E in concord (which are tasty), these are glass-like noodles that are completely different but well worth the trip.

When it comes to sushi, you can order a number of items, and I will not pretend to know what is what.  I will say that if you start ordering, prepare to be bombarded.  Our first trip, we ordered a couple of rolls, some noodles and some rice and we ended up with plate after plate - almost too much to fit on the table.  It seems that the more you order, the more you get.  Not just what you order, but complimentary tasting dishes as well.

Staff here is friendly and efficient, so feel free to ask them about the dishes.  In fact, you might need to do go out of your way to do so - it seems that they are flying around so quickly they may forget you.  Your food will come out, but if you need anything else (like a drink refill or to add something on), it can be a challenge to get their attention.  Other than that, they are quite a strip mall find.  Well worth the trip, even if you are not in the area."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch on 10/11/14 as we just moved and are trying to find a local sushi area since our regular ones are an extra 15 minutes away now. We went around 2pm which they had a sushi lunch special going on for half off sushi until 3pm so if course we had to partake. It was pretty slow in the restaurant, always maybe 2 to 3 tables being served. 

We got the normal sushi you would find everywhere: Spicy Tuna, Shrimp Temp, Philly Roll, Yellow Tail, and Crunchy Cali. They were all fresh and very delicious and extremely cheap at the half off price of $2-$3 per roll. 

The service was great and never missed a brat, but didn't over crowd us at the same time. This is definitely going to be or local spot from now on, glad we found this gem tucked away."}
{"text":"Great sushi and pretty good hibachi. I have been here several times. It's a nice hole in the wall restaurant."}
{"text":"Despite what I've heard about the sushi at Osaka, my first visit was fare from the kitchen, and I was pleasantly impressed.

They offer the expected hibachi entrees, as well as a nice selection of tempura dishes. I opted for the tempura chicken and vegetables - very crisp and tasty! The ginger dressing used on the salads is not the spicy, tangy dressing you normally find, which provided a nice change. The chefs were experimenting that night and brought us a sample of an appetizer not on the menu near the end of our meal: a jalapeno concoction that was quite good.  Another plus for me is that they include tofu as a protein option, and they actually cook it well.

The staff are very quick and incredibly friendly. I'll be visiting again pretty soon."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Osaka for years, and I'm sad to say that this last visit will probably be my last visit. The service was fast and friendly, but the food, which is the main reason for going to a restaurant, was really pretty poor.

I got a seaweed salad, which just didn't taste right, even though I've had them at Osaka before and thought they tasted great in the past. V2 Sushi orders, a California roll and a salmon roll, we're fine. But the two plates of chicken teriyaki tasted like something I would get at a public school cafeteria. The chicken was overcooked, the vegetables were overcooked, and not fresh cut, for example the carrots obviously came out of a large can of cut cooked carrots, and tasted like those hard things I remember from school days. Unfortunately that flavor infected the rest of the vegetables so the whole meal really tasted pretty bad.

I would give it a one-star, but like I said the service was excellent and our waitress very friendly and accommodating. And the sushi was okay."}
{"text":"Best sushi! Great service! We come here all of the time and recommend it to our friends!"}
{"text":"Sushi is really amazing here, lots of people don't know what to order so they don't give it a second chance. I always get specific rolls and am never disappointed! Caterpillar is my favorite, and multiple of the fried sushi, service is always nice, polite and quick."}
{"text":"Sushi-3
Service-5
Atmosphere-3

We got the eel and avocado, dirty old man, rock and roll, and philly king rolls. As a whole, the sushi was OK, not the best we've had, but OK. Our server was very attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and provided great service."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday evening and it was quiet.  The restaurant was clean and open.  The hostess sat us right away and there wasn't a wait on the food.  The menu was large and extensive.  They have Japanese style hibachi food and sushi.  I ordered the miso and salad to start and then had a teriyaki tofu dish.  

The tofu was large and a bit soggy.  The flavor was good, but it was definitely too soggy/wet for me.  The veggies were tasty, like I said the sauce they used was flavorful and perfect.  The miso was ok, just average.  The salad, the same.  Overall, nothing special.  I would come back and maybe try something different next time, with the same sauce!"}
{"text":"We have given Osaka their last chance.  They have good sushi, most of the time.  They do however take liberties with the ingredients.  My wife hates cream cheese.  When we complained that cream cheese was not in the description of ingredients, they said the rolls are subject to chef discretion (actually the explanation was not that simple or precise, but that is what the server was trying to say).  We gave then a second chance. All was well for 2-3 other orders.  This last time was a to go order.  We tried the tempura seafood for the kids.  12 pieces of seafood was the menu description.  We had 16 pieces of fried broccoli, onions, carrots, zucchini, 2 pieces of shrimp, and 6 pieces of something else.  Also, it was not tempura.  It was breading like you would find in your local grocery frozen fish section.  I called back to complain. I was polite, really I was.  I asked them why I had all then fried vegetables when I ordered seafood.  I was told,\"I just work here, I will ask my boss\". She came back and said, the order was correct.  If I was not happy, I should come back and they will give me more seafood.  I ask for them to credit me back the \"seafood\" tempura.  She said they would not do that.  I asked her if the \"shrimp\"tempura came with fried broccoli as well?  She said\"no it does not\". I then asked, \" why does the seafood tempura come with it then\". In the end, I took everything back to a very nice young lady who seems to completely understand my position, but she \" just worked there\".  Horrid customer service.  And it starts from the top.   Stay away."}
{"text":"I love sushi, and have had my share of mediocre meals when looking for good sushi.  I wasn't sure about Osaka, but decided to give it a shot one lunch hour about four months ago - I'm really glad that I did!  I've definitely become a repeat customer.  

The sushi is fresh and expertly rolled - it doesn't fall apart.  The crunch roll is VERY yummy.  I usually get the sushi and sashimi bento box, it runs about $11 and comes with salad and soup, and more than enough sushi and sashimi - I've never gone away hungry and more than once have been unable to finish it all!  

The service is decent, it's never been bad.

I absolutely recommend this to my friends!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience! Both the food and the service is top notch. The specials will have us coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Warning! This place has horrible! I've been to some of the best Japanese spots nearby and this is not one. Sushi was disgusting! The waiter forgot my hibachi entree and served me the check with it included. Manager did a terrible job resolving the matter.  Save your money and time."}
{"text":"Local place, the sushi was good and service was nice. It is a good place if you live in the area but I would not recommend anybody drive across town to visit it."}
{"text":"Everyone has their little neighborhood hot spots and THIS is mine.  I feel like a proud mother right now as I review this place because I live right down the street and we don't have much else to offer in this east charlotte/sorta matthews/mint hill area.  I'm proud to call Osaka my own.  

Osaka is our claim to fame.  

The atmosphere is not that great, the service is just okay and if you are ordering take-out it will be somewhat of a chaotic mess when you arrive.  They are clearly understaffed but I drove by yesterday and saw a \"We are hiring\" sign so that is a good thing!  Whenever I pick up my take-out the cashier sifts through a TON of receipts on the desk and somehow pulls out the right one.  It is actually quite impressive.

As far as the food...very fresh, consistent and great flavor.  They have excellent sushi.  I even love their vegetable roll for all the vegetarians out there....typically a veggie roll will have a cucumber and some carrot--bland and pukity.  But, Osaka takes it up a notch--they have asparagus, ginger relish, cucumber, carrot and you have the option to add cream cheese.  ***Insider's TIP: No matter what roll you get, they throw in a few free pieces when you order take-out!  They typically throw in something similar to a spider roll with eel sauce drizzled on top. 

I've also had their vegetable teriyaki over rice and that was also excellent.  The veggies were fresh--broccoli, onions, zucchini, squash, mushrooms, peppers.  They are not overly saturated in soy sauce but rather tossed lightly in their teriyaki sauce.  It comes with a side salad and a side of their ginger sauce.  The ginger sauce is awesome.

The location is inconvenient for so many people and it isn't like you are going to make a night out of hanging out in Mint Hill...but if you are in this area, it is worth the visit.  Heck, if you DON'T live in this area, it is worth a visit.  It is actually worth the drive!!  See you there!"}
{"text":"We got our food to go. I was surprised when they didn't ask me how I'd like my steak cooked for my steak & shrimp hibachi. I asked for medium rare, but they turned out to be very small, thin strips of well done steak. They were cut so thinly, I don't think it would have been possible to cook them any way BUT well. Most likely a cheap cut. After I got home, I found that they forgot to put my soup and salad in the bag, so I had to go back. They were nice, but the food overall was under seasoned, and the quality of the proteins were below average. Smallish shrimp and bland, small, strips of overcooked steak. The miso soup was so-so, and the salad was pretty bare bones (iceberg lettuce with three shavings of carrot). I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The rice on the sushi was overcooked and mushy. I also ordered chicken teriyaki and it was very under-seasoned."}
{"text":"Osaka is so good and reasonably priced! The staff is also extremely nice and helpful. I love their hibachi chicken and avocado rolls."}
{"text":"Don't fall for their $20 unlimited sushi/hibachi trap. There was a fruit fly in one of our sushi rolls and the manager/chef got mad at us for that. They made a big deal about remaking another roll. In fact, the remake was a different roll. Furthermore, the fried rice and sautéed veggies are mediocre. Too oily! The shrimp sauce is off balance ... way too much mayo. That was definitely my first and last time."}
