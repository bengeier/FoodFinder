{"text":"It was our second time ordering.. Our first pizza was good, it could have used more sauce, so this time around I just ordered more sauce, the house salad is soo good too!!  Its big enough for two people!"}
{"text":"Another good experience.  This time, we were hit with the the tired Friday night feeling of the last thing in the world I want to do is fire up the oven and cook.  So we made the call to Mangiamo's.  This time it was just a large pizza, half with what we like and half with what the kids like.  Again it was fantastic, with the service being really friendly.  My only complaint would be that they were able to get my pizza finished up way too quickly.  When I called they asked when I wanted it and stated they could have it ready in around 8 minutes.  Now that is more than an acceptable amount of time to make a pizza.  However, it's nearing 6 on a Friday.  This pizza is fantastic and the prices are excellent.  I hope next time I call at a peak time such as that I get told that they are slammed and I'm looking at a 20-30 minute pickup time.  C'mon people, I selfishly don't mind having really good food available before I can finish the drive to get that food .... but help out and make me wait a bit so that good food will still be around when I want it."}
{"text":"Excelente pizza  es la mejor que yo e comido  te recomiendo a que la pruebes te va a gustar mucho como a mi"}
{"text":"This place is good. I was skeptical at first but once i took a bite of my pizza i was delighted. The dough is so soft, and delicious. The cheese and pepperoni was perfect, put in enough sauce, i do not like a lot of sauce just enough to taste it. We got a large pizza and 8 wings plus a 2 ltr soda all for 14 and change. Good price, the wings were nice and hot as well."}
{"text":"Woah! Had a need for some excellent pizza and Mangiamo's did a great job! :D Had a need for pizza that accommodated a picky eater. Oh, this is a very satisfied customer. SOOOooooo full... Meatlovers & a sausage and bacon pizza. I know, it sounds silly, but woah did that work and taste fantastic! I mean... the BACON! :D #pizzacoma"}
{"text":"Customer service is great, although I was upset that when I called and asked for specials they only have me one option, and when I get there, they had much more specials than he wanted to mention.   The wings were delicious tho! Extra free ranch is always ok with me! The pizza was too dry, hardly any sauce. Probably wouldn't come back, only because I have more delicious pizza in my area"}
{"text":"Craving bar food tonight and came across this place. Definitely unexpected and so good. The carnivora pizza was piled with meat and just the right amount of veggies.  The wings were crispy and not greasy, with enough sauce to give you flavor.  Definitely coming back for more!"}
{"text":"This pizza is the absolute BEST pizzaaa I've ever had!!! Not only are they super affordable, they are incredibly delicious! If you've never tried their pizza, I'm 100% sure you wont regret it, and this is coming from a picky eater. They people are so friendly and everything about this place is great! I moved to Tempe after a year of them staying really close to my old house and MAN this is definitely the thing I miss the most from back home!   P.S. Try the Carnivora pizza and either substitute something for ham or just add ham and maaaaaan, youre set for a good night. And Definitely try eating it with the Valentina sauce! :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town hands down. The service is absolutely amazing as well. Their delivery service is great too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were out of our normal stomping grounds for a concert at Akchin Pavilion. My husband wanted pizza. I found this treasure on yelp not too far from the concert.  We loved it! The gentleman working the counter was very friendly.  He explained that the we're based out of Mexico and they made their pizza dough each morning.  We ordered a medium supee pizza. It was delicious! We tried some hot sauce that comes in packets from Mexico. Also delicious.  I would like to recommend you check this place out. Wish there was one on my side of town."}
{"text":"A solid pizza joint best for take out. Every bite resembles utopia in a slice of pizza. Lovingly made by hand with the freshest ingredients and not your chain pizza place.  Only downside to report is not enough variety and not really a great dine in area but otherwise excellent. The reason they don't drown the pizza in their homemade sauce is because they want you to taste the ingredients and we find that refreshing and love that about them. It's definitely a must try place and who knew Mexican pizza was so delicious!"}
{"text":"They assured us that all ingredients are fresh but from the sausage to the canned mushrooms we don't know what was fresh. Everything in the place was dirty: baseboards, windowsills, windows, doorframe, the trashcan was untouchable. It makes one wonder what's going on in the kitchen. I don't know how they got an A rating. The girl at the counter was either on her phone or watching TV the the entire time. If she has time to lean, she has time to clean.  We left 80% of our pizza on the table, we won't be back."}
{"text":"My first experience was not to good, my food was was cold and delivery person could not find my house... I was not happy with this order experience and not sure if I will order again."}
{"text":"We just moved to the Glendale area, and were looking for somewhere other than the \"regulars\" to deliver.  Hubby found this place on here, and they were friendly while ordering.  We went with the basic pizza/wings combo.  The pizza has a bread-like crust, which isn't my favorite, but it was really tasty.  Nothing against them, it's a personal preference.  I do like that they don't drown their pizza in sauce, the cheese was really good, too.  But, OMG...the wings!!  I fell in love with them.  Too bad I had to share the order with hubby, or I would've eaten all dozen of them...LOL!  We got the honey BBQ sauce, and it was amazing!  The wings are huge, too!  Just so good!!  (Can y'all tell that I really loved those wings??)"}
{"text":"Really glad i found this place. Pizza was excellent, as was the side salad we ordered. Everything is apparently homemade (sauce, dough, cheese blend, etc) and the guy at counter went into detail about how he and the owner (his dad, cooking in back) take a great deal of pride in making sure everything they do is just right. He asked how we liked the food no less than 2 bites into it; you could tell they really care, and it shows in the quality of their product. Overall, service and food was incredible and we most certainly will be back anytime that we are in the area. Thanks guys and keep killin it!"}
{"text":"Customer service was good. The two ladies working were very nice.  I had a large pepperoni pizza and garlic bread. The pizza crust and garlic bread dough tasted more like bread dough than pizza dough, almost sweet. It did have a nice fluffy texture, however. The marinara sauce was very bland. The cheese was delicious though. Not good enough to go back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Why get a slice when you can have a hot and fresh personal pizza. They start at $3.99 for a peperoni. I ordered the supreme for $4.99. Good value, fresh tasting, peperoni's were really good, its pizza with a Mexican twist (chorizo is a topping option). The only thing missing was a pizza crust crispy on the bottom (New York Style). Friendly staff, the Valentina hot sauce packet was a nice touch, I will be back! B+"}
{"text":"I'll start off by admitting that I might be a bit bias when it comes to this pizza place since I grew up next to one in San Luis Rio Colorado. A few days ago I brought my wife a pizza from Mangiamo's and we both loved it. The crust in particular is delicious, its crispy on the bottom and soft on the inside. Also the crust isn't super greasy or anything like some other places whose pizzas' leave the box saturated with grease. Like someone else already mentioned there isn't a lot of sauce on the pizza just enough so you can taste it but not to the point that it overpowers the flavors of the toppings. Overall I know we'll be eating at Mangiamo's again."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Tasted really fresh and had tons of flavor! And the service was awesome!! They even opened up 5 minutes early for us!!"}
{"text":"The first time I had Mangiamo's was for lunch one day when my boss sent me over to grab two $5 pies.  Considering it's a small cozy shop, this place sure does pack a punch!  A great $10-something spent!  The crust of the pizza is perfect.  I was anticipating a typical greasy pie like their competitors across the way but was pleasantly surprised.  It was crisp to perfection on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside.  They go light-handed on the sauce which my boss didn't like but I found it to be perfect.  If the sauce is flavorful, you don't need to drench the dough, right?  The toppings are fresh, the spices used are great, and overall it's a solid place for a quick bite.   After stopping in a few more times, I can say that the consistency of their quality and taste is on point.  It's delicious and makes the tummy and wallet happy!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza place. Great customer service. Food was freshly prepared.  Ordered a personal pepperoni pizza and a side of  garlic bread. The dough was good, not too thick, thin or crispy - just right. It was also tasty, not like the cardboard stuff you get from chain spots. Sauce was good.  Even the garlic bread was good. Great family-owned spot that I'll continue to support."}
