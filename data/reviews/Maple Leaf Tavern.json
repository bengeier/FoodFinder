{"text":"We went for our first time last week. Was so disappointed. I was going to order a glass of wine but not $12 for 5 ounces. I had the halibut fish for $28. Too expensive and I was hungry afterwards. The portion was not worth the price. There are many better restaurants around with better food options and good value. The Brooklyn Tavern is close by. The food and wine and great with great prices!! I will not be returning to this place:)"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and it was delicious! The food was tasty, presented well, and of excellent quality. Our server was very attentive and we thought the ambiance was bright and airy, while still having the pub feel. I'm looking forward to going here for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Beautiful renovation of this building.  You really feel that you are in a dark private club room with lovely booths and banquets and a very hotel style bar in the middle.  We went on a Saturday night and it was quite buzzing - a great atmosphere.  Service was prompt at first but got slow later on.  Beer is reasonably priced but comes in a US pint glass (around $8) - a recent trend in Riverdale.  House Wine was $12 a glass.  Bottles of wine started at $55 (3 or 4) then a $60 bottle then you're at $69 and above.  I felt our waiter was pushy trying to get us to order the small things - like the bread plate ($6) or a caesar salad ($15) for the table or the upgrade from fries ($7) to Hassleback Potato ($13).  It felt more like he was trying to pad the bill than offer us the best things available.   Food was pleasant if unremarkable, - portions certainly on the smaller side.  Cheeseburger & Fries were good ($20); Medium steak was a bit too cool with no side but decent ($24); the lasagna has been reinterpreted and was interesting but dry  ($22) and came with an afterthought child size chef salad that was garlicky; the Salt Cod was fine ($26); Carrots ($9) were carmelized and really tasty but the creamed brussel sprouts ($9) were disappointing.  We all thought the food was enjoyable but have no desire to return.   Compared to other restaurants we've enjoyed, the experience didn't feel like a good value.  When you get into the price range of $400 for a meal for 4 (with alcohol and tips) you want to be wowed a little and this place didn't wow."}
{"text":"Excellent ambience and service. Beer selection was great and sauage appetizer excellent. My wife had an excellent cod dish, my swordfish was good, fries were supreme. Great place!"}
{"text":"Surprising find in the east end on a grungy strip opposite Wal-Mart! Lovely decor from a classy and careful renovation. I liked the small oil lamps on each table. Mixture of tables and booths. Not too noisy and so could have a decent conversation without shouting. Wait staff were very attentive but 3 different people attended us and so I'm not sure who OUR waitperson was. Wine/beer offerings were limited but interesting and off the beaten track. Waitress offered us tastes of 3 beers I didn't know. Nice. The food was standard fare but with interesting ingredients and side touches. We had the roasted vegetables - mixture of hot and cold with unusual seasonings and a different cheese (halloumi). Then the striploin (VERY tender and moist) and lamb shoulder. Good coffee. Will definitely go again and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Caught me by surprise and blew my damn socks off. Steak, truffle potatoes, lasagna, whiskey sour and stealth margarita perfection. I'll be back and don't you get in my way."}
{"text":"Maximize profits vs. dining experience  We made reservations for an early diner to make sure the restaurant was not too busy.  When we arrived, we were promptly seated.  Service is a major thing you pay for and confusion started right away, as they could not figure out who our server would be.  Overall service was poor as food service was slow, server was inattentive and mistakes were made to our order.   The overall menu is sparse with nothing for vegetarians.  The price of sides add up quickly: sausage is two small pucks, bread $5, pickled egg best value $1.50 but undercooked for me.  We felt the menu was overpriced for the quality and especially small portion sizes. We enjoyed the mixed drink selection, as it is creative.  The beer drinker in our group felt the Craft beer selection was good but some big company cartel beers could be eliminated. Frosted mugs are nice but they do require a coaster for the moisture from eventual melting. Wine is expensive starting at $60 a bottle, glasses $2/oz. The décor is nicely done. Wifi is very spotty - constantly connects on and off - probably need a new router.  Our first interaction with the Maple Leaf Tavern was walking by one afternoon after it had recently opened.  The chef gave us a menu to review but when we returned it and we asked the General Manager if we could take a quick look inside he said no. Said to come back at 5pm. We felt this was poor marketing as we are in their target market.   We support all our neighbourhood restaurants but cannot justify going back to this one.   Our party felt the restaurant was designed to maximize profits with less regard for the overall dining experience."}
{"text":"Good :  - beautiful reno - they really dropped some bucks into this place - floor no longer smells of stale beer - wide selection, particularly of wine and beer  - service attentive and knowledgeable for the most part  Bad:   - really expensive compared to other similar places in the neighbourhood -- really really expensive for Gerrard East - probably too high end for the neighbourhood - a big pork chop for $48 bucks  !  Astronomical  - patio was not yet open when we went (early June ?)  - looking for a Coors Light or a Molson Dry ?  You won't find it here -- think \"craft\" (ie expensive) beers and Euro brands  - bring your Visa platinum card   Would have got 3-4 stars except for the high prices"}
{"text":"Upscale pub with high quality food and excellent ambience. Their 5 sausage special was deliciously savory and the gnocchi was just the right density. I'd go again.  Not a place for children if you don't have a reservation, as the bar tables are too high for child seats and they don't have boosters."}
{"text":"I've been a few times.  Go if you're comfortable paying a little more for quality food and atmosphere vs. some of the other cheaper but mediocre places in the area.  It's a nice, welcome addition to the neighourhood along with Pinkertons bar.  The burger is tasty, not too big, juicy with very good fries.  I also liked the fish cakes which were flavorful and light and the ceasar salad.  I've always found the staff to be friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. We've dined here a number of times and their food has been consistently above average."}
{"text":"A really nice space and beautifully renovated. Came here for brunch with husband and baby. The restaurant wasn't busy around noon time on a Saturday. The service was great and we found the restaurant to be quite baby-friendly with high chairs and changing table so I was pleasantly surprised. The food was awesome. We had the MLT breakfast and the corned beef hash which exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"Um... for brunch just simply \" no \".   We were excited about trying this restaurant as we had read good things on Yelp and heard it mentioned on BT.  Upon entering we were pleasantly surprised - they've done a great job on the interior.  It was a birthday brunch so there were 6 of us.  We started with a  2 orders of scones (2/plate), pickles, and shrimp.  The scones were strangely squares of some sort of cake/bread (so disappointing - definitely NOT scones), the 3 shrimp at $2.50/each were served like like something that should have come from an old school truck stop.  We should have stopped there, but we didnt.  My \"Whipped Yoghurt, House Granola, Honey, Fruit Preserve For $12 was a small scoop of not-whipped Greek Yogourt, a little bit of raw oats with a few sunflower seeds, a few diced fruit??? and a drizzle of honey.  The red thing I found floating in my container of cream was a little odd - they brought a replacement, though. The other meals were mediocre.  The avocado toast - though good, just didn't cut it as it literally is one small piece of toast with a chopped avocodo. $160 later (and that only included one alcoholic Caesar), we were sorely disappointed.  IMHO its way overpriced, bland, very uninspired food served in a lovely refurbished old pub.  Will definitely not return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks Sat. March 11 to round off birthday celebrations with my fella. So glad we made the Maple Leaf part of our night. Had a warm welcome at the bar. Really felt that neighbourhood bar vibe. Great conversation throughout the night with our trusty bar keep on everything from Scottish-Irish politics, tequila, theories on local resto openings and closing to championing the longevity of \"My Bar\"...thanks for to fun end to our evening!! P.s. The Canadian Coffee is a perfect cold weather warmer-upper!!!"}
{"text":"Maple Leaf Tavern has become a local favourite. The venue is nice and spacious, well decorated, there is an outdoor patio in the summer, booths, tables, private dining rooms and a nice bar - something for everyone.   Tremendous breakfast, lunches and dinner - the food and drinks are consistently great - have never had a single thing to complain about. Quite enjoy their spicy pickles!   I was uncertain if I should give 5 stars but I really cannot find fault in anything about this well oiled operation. The staff are all knowledgeable and they clearly have top talent in the kitchen. Will continue to visit this establishment and would highly recommend it to others.   I have heard others complain about the prices but I think they are entirely fair for the standard of fare and the venue."}
{"text":"I was informed the restaurant underwent a major renovation. The ambiance was very pleasing and quiet; however it was a bit too quiet and subdued for such a busy/trendy neighbourhood. Quite frankly it was boring and flat. Service was mediocre.  Location was okay, unsure about parking as I parked on the street.   I ordered cocktail shrimp: 3/order, fish cakes: 3/order and a glass of Chardonnay (I was told that the Pinot wasn't chilled) with tip bill came to $48. Not impressed with prices.   Would I return? No, there are a plethora of other 'taverns'/ restaurants in the area which are priced reasonably."}
{"text":"We were very impressed by the Maple Leaf Tavern.  I've gone twice for dinner, with two different groups of people, and everyone thought the place was great both times.    Service is friendly, prompt and helpful.  Both times we had excellent service, both at the bar and later at the table.    The food is excellent.  In particular, the tomahawk pork chop, the lasagna, the fish, and the mutton chops were very well received by our group, as well as the sides, the Caesar salad (the smoked bacon on the salad is beautiful) and the burrata.  One of my friends had the ribeye steak and said that it was delicious, but not outstanding.  I'm quite conscious of value for money, and did not find the prices expensive for what we got.  Yes, the tomahawk pork chop is $48, but they recommend it for two people.  And it is truly a wonderful entree.  As far as I am concerned, the prices are fair given the quality of the service, the food and the surroundings.  As far as I am concerned, the only major failing is that there is no vegetarian entree on the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Was expecting good but everything was actually really really great. Lamb croquet the was excellent, bread service was amazing, whole fish was amazing. The only thing I didn't love was the burger, which was dressed like a big Mac, but not specified on the menu - still good, but just wish I knew."}
{"text":"The Maple Leaf Tavern is as enjoyable as dining out gets.   The new renovation is beautiful, with incredible attention to detail (the lettering on the menu's, the stir sticks...). It's all very sophisticated without being stuffy or overwrought. They really nailed the tavern vibe.  But it's the food that truly sets this place apart. The menu is fairly straightforward, but everything is made to such a high standard that every plate, from the glazed carrots to the grilled beef, is exceptional. Even something as simple as bread & butter are elevated to something deliciously memorable.   The beer and wine selection is solid (some nice craft beer options), and the Rye and Ginger on tap is particularly tasty - honestly, I don't know how you'd not have an incredible experience here. Already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is such a gem. It looks almost misplaced in the neighbourhood that it's in, but it's definitely worth a trek. Me and some friends came here for their Winterlicious menu.  From the moment we walked in, the customer service was impeccable! You could tell that Winterlicious had them busy, so as we waited we were offered drinks and escorted to watch the kitchen. Staff were extremely pleasant and personable!   As for the food, I got the sausage to start, burger as the main, and toffee pudding for dessert. The sausage was to die for, and that's coming from someone who doesn't even typically like pork! The burger was very juicy, but nothing too special.   Now the dessert-- that was the winner! I would probably go back just to get it! It's a toffee cake with maple and toffee toppings, very delicious.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the wait between courses was quite long. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that it was because of the overwhelming traffic from Winterlicious connoisseurs, so if you are crunched for time, just be mindful of that.  Overall, this little restaurant is definitely top-notch and I can see myself coming here with friends if I am ever in the area... Or maybe even if I'm not for that dessert!!"}
{"text":"Lovingly renovated! The tiling sparkles when you walk in. Beautiful exposed brick and solid wood panels. Top notch cocktails and modern food pairings. Radishes with hummus. Salmon with mustard butter. Sausage with turnips. All delicious. The setting looks like an updated 1960s Manhattan steak house but airy. The ownership shows a love of food and attention to atmosphere. Service was friendly and professional. Local food and wine highlighted."}
{"text":"Amazing. Good food. Service was so-so, not as attentive as I would like.  Great atmosphere. Went there for a late brunch."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Maple Leaf Tavern on Saturday night, and everything was amazing. I would recommend it!!!  Had a \"Girls Night\" out with my best friend.  We were provided the option to sit at the chefs table and view the open kitchen, and we took this fun option which I would recommend for two people, a date, best friends, etc.  It was great seeing the thoughtful and hard work the team put into all the dishes. The stools were very comfortable and there were purse hooks - the whole space is quaint and well thought out - very warm feel.    What we tried:  -Pickled Pepperoni  (amazing!) -Spicy Pickles (great, a touch spicy, but great) -Cheeseburger (fantastic - super delicious, and I am a burger connoisseur)  Desserts - we went a little crazy and it was well worth it. -Chocolate & Peanut Butter Mouse (this has warm and cold and is fantastic, warm chocolate mouse on ice cream, etc) -Sticky Toffee Pudding (my absolutely favourite - this came from heaven for sure) -Crispy Rice Pudding (this is like a gourmet fantastic delightfully delicious and creative dessert).   Bottom line - the Chef has done an amazing job.  It's exciting to see this great restaurant pop up in this neighbourhood.  I would recommend this place for a date, or dinner with friends.  I will go back.    Service was friendly and great."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience dining at the Maple Leaf Tavern, everything from the greeting at the front door to the service to the food.  Had the cheeseburger which was undercooked and all the waitress and the hostess could say was \"sorry\".  And it was expensive for what you got.  I've been there a couple of times and each time it gets worse, I will not be going back there."}
{"text":"I had dinner at the Maple Leaf Tavern shortly after it's reopening with my parents, husband and two children, ages 8 and 10.    The good: - was able to get same-day reservations!  Our table had a view of the kitchen, and it was very interesting to watch the chefs work - the interior of the restaurant is gorgeous, dark, spacious and warm.  - excellent service!  often when new restaurants get off the ground, service is a little shaky.  Not  so here.  - the lasagna, much talked about in the blogs, was excellent.  My husband, son and father really enjoyed the sausages, which they ordered more or less a la carte, with a number of sides - they were willing to accommodate my fussy 8 year old with some gnocchi that is not on the menu  The so-so: - very pricey for what you get (portions are smaller than you'd expect).  I suppose the $1M reno has to be paid for somehow.  The bad: - the lasagna came with a side salad.  The leaves were not cut bite sized in mine - one of the leaves had to be 6 inches in diameter.  The dressing needed work as it was overly salty. - while I'm thrilled that they were able to accommodate my 8 year old by providing her with some gnocchi, I think restaurant needs to get a better feel for just how much a child would eat when making a recommendation. It was suggested that a half-portion of gnocchi would be sufficient, but when it arrived the serving size was tiny - perhaps the serving size you'd give to a toddler, not an 8 year old. - bread is not complimentary.  Bread and butter is listed on the menu under snacks for $5!  The good (redux): - when we asked about the serving size for the gnocchi, we were given another half portion of gnocchi free of charge (which is great, since the first half portion was $12 - expensive for a tiny handful of gnocchi).  Overall, I think the restaurant is worth going to once, to check out what has been done with the space, but I don't know if I would go back a second time as it's relatively overpriced and it didn't blow me away.  Edit: Just received a  Yelp  \"compliment\" from someone who I think may have been our waitress when we ate there berating me for posting this and calling me entitled!  Keep it classy, Maple Leaf Tavern.  Keep it classy."}
{"text":"Summerlicious with my aunt. She said. 'We're going to Maple Leaf Tavern; their cheeseburger will change your life.' Who can argue with that?   Easy to find, across the street from Gerrard Square(free parking, yay!), it stood out in this neighbourhood. Located in an older part of town, Maple Leaf's bold exterior catches your eye. The dark wood covering the front, goes right through the interior creating a luxurious, yet still pub-like atmosphere.  The kitchen is completely open, so you can even sit at the counter to watch all of the action. Even though it was a full house, the Chef and kitchen staff all appeared calm and focused.   The first course started with salads, I had the Little Gem Salad and my Chef Aunt chose the Caesar Salad. She has been there before, so she knew it was a mean salad. Large romaine leaves tossed in anchovy dressing, sprinkled with parm and topped with a slice of grilled bacon. It tasted as good as it looked! My Little Gem salad had large leaves with a variety of picked veggies. So tasty!   The main course was the whole reason we went there: MLT Cheeseburger. My Aunt said everything is made in house, from the bun to the grounding of the beef. This IS a life changing burger! The beef was cooked medium and was juicy and bursting with flavour. The cheese and bun were on point. My favourite part was the housemade relish. If I had this at home, I'd never put ketchup on a burger again! Like my Aunt said, it's good because they don't mess with it. It's not processed or imported; farm-to-table is clearly the way to go!   After all of that deliciousness, we kept dessert simple...ice cream and sorbet.    The service was phenomenal. Jeremy knew his stuff and the way he described beer and wine was perfection. We were both pleased with his suggestions. Great beer and wine selection too!    I've already got a craving for that cheeseburger...oh darn...looks like I'll have to go back!"}
{"text":"My second time here for brunch. Service is excruciatingly slow and it was not that busy. Do not order the hamburger it was not worth $20.00. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Very swanky looking upscale brunch place with southern comfort feel. Love the honeycomb tiles at the entrance and the old school cigarette dispenser for $1.26. Lots of wine, beer on tap to offer. Perfect Sunday brunch spot for our group of 12 people!  Ambiance 6/5- love the space and how it's decorated. They even have hooks for your jackets! Parking was free on the street wooh!   Service 4/5 - we made a reservation for 1:30 and showed up at 1 instead but they sat us anyways. The servers are very helpful, friendly and easy to talk to. They have a great sense of humour it seems. After we sat down the waiter took our drink order right away. Then after we made our food order they gave us some scones on the house because they knew the food would take a while to make with the high traffic. The food came warm which was great. The only down side was that getting the bill took a bit more time than we would have liked since we're in a hurry to leave at 2:30.   Taste 5/5 - I ordered the tavern breakfast ($13) with a coffee. It came with three eggs (over easy), hash browns, sausage, bacon and toast. The tastiest was the hash browns. The eggs were medium done which was perfect. The sausages was not really what I had expected. I imagined they were going to be breakfast sausages but instead they were pepperoni sausages.   Price 6/5 - great bang for your buck here!! Gonna come back here for brunch for sure!!"}
{"text":"We live close by and have been here several times, we've always had good service and good quality food, which is why when my ten year old asked to go here for his birthday lunch today I was pretty happy to oblige. In addition to my 10 year old, I also brought my one year old son.   The service was subpar to say the least.  As I was struggling with a stroller to get through the door the hostess glanced up at me and then back at her phone. A few minutes later a child was crying directly behind her and she looked up from her phone only to roll her eyes at another server.   We sat down and placed our orders, my son ordered the Tavern breakfast (which was fine) and I ordered the cheeseburger (which was not fine at all, and also lacking cheese). The service was very slow. I pulled the waitress aside while my son wasn't watching and said it was his birthday could we please get a scoop of ice cream with a candle at the end of our meal. She, of course, obliged however once we had eaten, we sat at our table without any service for about 15 minutes. I piled up our dirty dishes hoping someone would take them away and get the hint that we were ready to go. Also, at this point, my one year old had lost all of his patience and was starting to fuss and cry out.  Finally with the plates cleared, I asked for the bill politely. Another ten minutes rolled by with me trying to calm my overtired one year old and restless 10 year old. Eventually, I went to the bar to ask the manager (?) if I could simply pay up. She handed me a bill with the ice cream on it. I said I was sorry but it had taken too long and we simply had to go. She insisted that it was almost ready several times while I also pointed to my screaming child and said again, sorry but we have to leave. She takes off in a huff and tells the kitchen staff the order is cancelled, then comes back, grabs my credit card and starts inputting the bill amount. I ask why I'm paying for the ice cream, she yells \"UGGGH! I I'm so busy I forgot to remove it, Okay???!!\" then grabs the bill from my hands and removes my card from the machine and throws it at me.  She fixes the bill, turns around and slams it on the counter as well as the machine. She threw my receipt on the counter without so much as a thanks. I was astounded at her rudeness and I told her so.   If you have children, as most people in Leslieville do, avoid this place like the plague. Also, if you care for good service or good food, just go elsewhere. I know I will."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  I had dinner here in a Saturday night with a small group. We made a reservation and were seated promptly. When we first arrived the place was about 70% full, but within an hour it was packed. The service started off great but as the place became more busy it was hard to pin down the wait staff. They seemed understaffed, so I don't blame the waiter, but it took us a while to order and pay. Additionally, a number of items we ordered did not come out and we had to remind our waiter, which would take a while to catch him.   Other than that, the food was fantastic. They have a number of gluten-free options and are willing to make accommodations for additional allergies. I had the mutton chop, which was fantastic. They also have a selection of ciders, wines and gluten-free cocktails, along with a couple of mocktails.   TL;DR good food, accommodates allergies, slow service"}
{"text":"If you want the worst service in Toronto, head to this spot. They sure know how to take care of you. First they seated us and after five minutes moved  us to another table. When we asked questions about certain dishes we got sarcastic answers and lastly to top it of we asked for separate checks and they gave us one bill. When asked to split it the hostess rolled her eyes and said it's only a difference of a couple of dollars suggesting we're cheap."}
{"text":"Great room, the renovation is top notch.   We had a number of dishes from the menu including duck sausage, bacon, picked pepperoni, halibut, and a burger.  All items were presented beautifully, and had some great flavour."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for my sons bday. The only good thing is the old fashion was probably closest to one of the best I've ever had. Now for the cons. We ordered tuna it came out well done. They never asked how we wanted it done. Any chef with any kind of experience would know it's cooked rare to medium rare. Also ordered the lasagna. I was so excited to get this dish the menu made it sound phenomenal. WRONG! This lasagna was the smallest piece of lasagna I have ever had. It was crunchy from being dried out, the sauce made chef boyarde look pretty good . The noodles were not layered but stacked side ways. We did have the trout too and it was good. The service was ok when we first got there but diminished quick and became very scarce. The draft beer is not cold neither is the water.  Pretty disappointed in a meal like this costing $240 for 3 people with 5 drinks."}
{"text":"A bite from our full experience review -  \"With an old gas light-inspired flickering candle on the table, Ma Cherie marvelled over the Tavern's well-designed brand. The leather menu with gold foil letters was a nice touch, but nothing to compare to the pattern adoring the menu as if endpapers of a book.\""}
{"text":"This place was recommended by friends. It was really amazing. The food off the wood grill was fantastic."}
{"text":"Another solid addition to the hood. The place is gorgeously refurbished, sexy and welcoming. I went once for drinks and a snack of beef tartar (with their tasty hot sauce) and then came back a days later with my SO and my two kids. My youngest had a sausage and some of their amazingly tasty homemade bread (three different kinds when you order it off of the menu) SO and I had the roast chicken for 2 which my kiddos ended up sharing with us too. So moist and tasty! Was surprised at how high end the place was but the vibe isn't at all stuffy. The servers are laid back and on their game and will happily navigate you through any menu questions. I felt badly for the bartender when I was there both times it seemed like she was flying solo for the entire restaurant and didn't stop moving. We'll be back for sure just not as often as I'd hoped going in as its far fancier (pricier) than I had hoped."}
{"text":"Big fan. Been several times for dinner, brunch and with groups as well as just myself and my husband. Food is always excellent, great service and great drinks. Very classic / classy. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Really exceeded expectations. Best cheeseburger I have ever had- and I've had most of Toronto's finest. Everything about this burger was exceptional, but the bun was perfection. Striploin steak was very simply prepared and perfectly cooked to order. Cauliflower appetizer was outstanding. Cocktails, also very good (especially the Hotel Nacional). Only downer was the \"breakfast radish.\" Well presented, but the hummus was too runny and mild in flavour to complement the radish. Menu is much bigger than what is on their website. Lots of options.  Very nice decor. Hope this place succeeds! Give it a try."}
{"text":"Love at first sight and first bite. So glad this East end eyesore has been tastefully renovated. And the food is wonderful - the 'vegetarian' option was an delicious flavour adventure."}
{"text":"Great spot in east Toronto. I'm still thinking about the food a day later means something was done right. First time I've been to a place we're the sides are just as good as the main. Glazed carrots (waiter recommended) and cauliflower cheddar is super good.  My only complaint was the fish with Savoy cabbage. Very mushy texture and potato on bottom was hard to eat.  Ribeye and striploin cooked perfectly. Would definitely go back to try other things on the menu. Make reservations on the weekend as it gets very busy."}
{"text":"If the food matched the decor they would have a winning formula. Sadly, it does not. I wish I could describe the food we had as mediocre, but that would be embellishing. You will spend a fortune and walk away saying, \"for what we spent we could have gone to (insert the name of your favourite restaurant where you actually enjoy your meal)\", instead of a forgettable one.  If an entire table of people could not find one item they enjoyed, that pretty much sums up our evening."}
{"text":"This place has been open since Spring of this year. We finally made it there this evening for dinner. Great atmosphere, this used to be a dumpy watering hole back in the day. Now the place had a major over haul and it's really beautiful and modern inside. I had the lasagna which is a whole new twist to the traditional type. My partner had the burger, tastes like a big mac however made fresh with real ingredients. Our desserts consisted of cheddar cheesecake and fried crispy rice pudding. The food was spectacular, the chef is top notch and the food is not like you ever tasted before. I'm already looking forward to my return in a week or two. It's kind of strange when you walk out of the restaurant after your dinner you're like in a different world. You just had a wonderful dinner adventure in the maple leaf and then you walk out on to Gerard street with Gerard Scare Mall (square) in your line of focus. Weird but wonderful. We'll be back soon, our new favourite supper club."}
{"text":"Tasting menu for a special birthday.   An assortment of wonderful starter bites, Amazing steak  tartare, Caesar salad with huge slab bacon, boneless oxtail confit served Wellington style, hasselback potatoes with shaved foie gras, roasted carrots, roasted cauliflower, 3 desserts including deconstructed cheesecake with candies bacon.   Absolutely amazing meal with each course better than the previous."}
{"text":"I went here with a big group of family, we were 7 in total. The restaurant was packed, even though it was a Wednesday. The drinks were fantastic. Decent value for the price. The wine list was quite short, and expensive if bought \"by the glass\". As a big group, were ordered lots of starters and mains and shared. The burrata was perfect, and made with grilled peaches and a balsamic vinegar. The pickled pepperoni was average, as were the fish cakes. For mains, I had the lasagna and it was unlike anything I've eaten before - rich flavours with the tomato sauce on the outside. The striploin steaks were quite large, but you need to order a side (mains are a la carte). Service was good but the mains were slightly slow to come out. To be expected with a large group. It was a wonderful experience and I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name or location deter you.  The establishment has been around for decades, Years ago it was a seedy bar in a seedy area. No, more!  The renovation is excellent. Now upscale, but still warm and cozy. 1/2 dining and the other half more pub style. Though there still are some dilapidated homes close by, the whole area has been going thru rejuvenation and has many upscale properties with a high percentage of upper income residents. The specific location is now starting to offer more establishments more appealing to that sector of the local residents.  The food was amazing. Definitely not your traditional \"tavern food\". Similarly the drink list had fashionable and unique offerings.  The staff was on the mark and they and the management were accommodating.  The prices are more than a simple traditional tavern, but venue, selection, quality and service command such. Definitely a higher end offering than other places in that specific local.  Looks like they may be offering a patio on the side which I will definitely try."}
{"text":"My experience here was remarkably weird, due our server (male) basically molesting my boyfriend while giving me the catty cold shoulder. No joke - he really couldn't keep his hands off. There were four of us (two couples) and my partner got an over-abundance of touchy-feely attention, some shoulder rub type of cozy familiarity on the repeat, which was inappropriate. I guess the server had a thing for bearded types.  The chef of this place, however, is exceptionally professional and came over to our table to say a quick hello, acknowledge all of us, and even sent us out a complimentary plate of delicious roasted carrots in a parsley sauce. Kudos to him, because all of the food was outstanding. I had the grilled trout (perfection), while my partner had the steak (also perfection). Really, phenomenal food. We all really enjoyed the sausage sampler with the various types of mustard, too. It was just the lascivious server that left a bad taste in my mouth, and made my partner feel a little incredulous. I mean, there's friendly service... and then there's frrrrrrrrrrrrriendly service."}
{"text":"Been hearing this place had a stories, rowdy past. Passing by the Maple Leaf Tavern every day to and from school growing up however, it did not look like a place I'd want to step into (I sure as heck don't know what it was like inside then), and also like a place that might not last much longer. Then sure enough the seedy place got revamped and reopened as a classy upscale restaurant. Maybe not surprising given what is happening in this rapidly changing stretch of Gerrard circa 2017, to which the Tavern is a metaphor of this shocking transition. The old sign that once graced the front now hangs in the side patio attached to an iron fence.  This new version of the Maple Leaf Tavern, storied as I have heard it is, comes across initially to me as a slightly fancier version of The Keg, meanwhile the outside certainly now stands out cleanly from the rest of the block. It sure feels tastefully charming inside, with a variety of seating options, and a vintage vending machine to greet you that they apparently dug up from the basement (where you will find the washrooms by the way).  Someone on Instagram once told me he thought their lasagna was a shocker. I had to see why. So of course for my dinner I ordered the bloody thing, being a pasta sucker myself. The $24 lasagna in question was who knows how many layers of noodles packed together, served sideways. It was crusty on one side, mellow and dense, and was not as saucy and packed in savoury tastes as I would have liked. The bone marrow elements added some phat fatty flavour in an otherwise a C grade dish. My sister meanwhile had a grilled albacore tuna ($20), and it was a perfect banger. I tried a piece and enjoyed the grilled flavour hints from the clean white meat. Service was on top to match the classy tone.  Even though this area is shockingly changing, the prices are quite up there for the area. I honestly see this renewed and dressed up Tavern as merely a respectable destination restaurant for a date night or a special brunch occasion."}
{"text":"Came here for a bday party.   Easy online reservations.   Accommodates kids. You can request a high chair. They provide crayons and paper for them.   Modern but cozy Ambience. I don't even remember hearing music, which was good because we could actually hear each other. Very busy on a sat evening.  We ordered:   Bread and butter - $6 - not necessary worth it, but some of the bread was soft and flavourful. Some was a bit hard for my liking. Two kinds of bread. - B  Lasagna: $23 - very different from traditional lasagna. Crunchy on the outside with grounded veal, tiny mushrooms, and tomato sauce. It was not too salty and just the right amount of tomato sauce. I liked it. Salad was a nice touch. Beware, portion is a bit on the small size, but I was very full after my meal. A  Cup of punch - $10 - very interesting. Literally punch in a cup. It was pretty strong. A bit sour. Impressive presentation, but nothing too special in terms of drink itself. B  Toffee pudding - $10 - delicious! Warm and soft. We asked the waiter to bring a piece of dessert with a candle on the notes. They remembered and it was sweet. FYI: this is not comped. A   Service was awesome! Our waiter was very sweet and handled all our demands.   They have a kids menu as well.   Good for groups!  Only side street parking available."}
{"text":"I'd never been to Maple Leaf Tavern before its most recent renovation. Built in 1910, the space has a storied history behind it...and was once apparently a brawler bar full of rough-and-tough types. I don't know much more about its former life, but today, this is a stylish restaurant with an eye-catching central bar, open-concept kitchen and elegant old-school vibe.  I opted for the whole sea bream, cooked on a wood-burning grill, and served with fresh lemon, quality sea salt and a boat of buttery beurre blanc. Delish. On the side I went for the hasselback potatoes, which were super tender and served with addictively rich truffle sauce topped with chilled fois gras. Outstanding! For dessert, the sticky toffee pudding, with caramelized white chocolate, birch syrup (a delicious, complex alternative to maple) and vanilla cream was so good I almost licked the plate clean.  Service was also stellar.  Definitely a solid bet for a nice meal in the east end!"}
{"text":"Went for Mothers day dinner with my girl and daughter. The host was very accommodating especially since we had a stroller. Really nice looking restaurant with a great vibe. Very welcoming. Food was excellent.  Had the seasonal soup and the sausages for a starter both excellent. Sausages tasted fresh and hand made with great flavour. Finished off with the tomahawk pork, the cauliflower side and hassleback potato. Pork was awesome, juicy and really tasty and with the rosemary apple sauce. Sides were even better! the cauliflower was the winner with the potaoes coming close second. Service was really good our table was touched only when needed and everything came out in the perfect time. Recommendations were spot on. Definitely will be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I've been to this \"establishment\" once in my life and that is once too many.  I went with 2 friends and had a pitcher, I think the selection was between swill and recycled on tap. There was a woman passed out in vomit at a table in the corner, couple of toothless old men at the bar and wrestling on the a couple of big screens. There's a sign outside that proclaims they have karaoke, though I wouldn't attend I could only imagine the travesty of slurred Conway Twitty and Loretta Young that would be.  At one point the bartender switched the station to hardcore porn and yelled \"It ain't wrassling boys but sure is full contact\"  We finished our beers in an attempt of silence and left.  Well at least the beer was really, really cheap."}
{"text":"Hmmm....  Had brunch here. The options were somewhat limited, yet I spotted a waffle on the menu that looked good. The server asked \"do you want it sweet or savoury?\" I said sweet assuming that had something to do with the waffle, only to learn that \"sweet\" meant fresh fruit on top, while savoury meant bacon.  The waffle was a waffle. There was a small amount of fresh fruit on the top. For 14$ it was no deal. I don't typically feel like I didn't get enough to eat after a meal, yet I did here.  Others at my table had the $20 burger and had mixed opinions. They were also out of two of the 5-6 advertised draught beers.  The coffee was hot and refilled quickly, and service was generally good.  The restaurant itself is charming and laid out nicely."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on the wknd. With some friends. Great renovation for this former \"bruiser bar\"! Food was good although there is a lot of competition sprouting up in the area! Portions a little light for price but still a good meal. Quadruple mark up,at least, for a glass of plonk though! Perhaps use an importer rather than LCBO which makes comparisons difficult but we're on to that trick!   Service was \"ok\", food was good, just hope they sort their wine list out! Until they do, we'll pass. Don't like feeling duped!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out after seeing great review in Toronto life. Went group of 8 on good Friday .  What a disappointment! Me and a girlfriend both started with beet salad- her shaved beets were so doused in  vinegar they were inedible, mine was missing this part of the dish altogether. For mains 2 ppl at our table ordered lasagna and for 22$ all you got was a slice about 1.5\" thick that was almost all pasta- they must have run out in the kitchen or something it was that bad- I got the 3 sausages and they were all quite dry again because sliced so small.  We had the peanut butter mousse for dessert and it was like a warm liquid that wasn't set at all- more like hot chocolate than mousse.  We couldn't complain because our server was barely at our table the entire night- would just drop off food and leave never asking if people liked it but probably didn't care because she had already added her 18% tip on all the cheques.  My husband ordered a beer to go with his entree and didn't get it until after dessert was finished.  The only positives of the whole experience is that the ambiance and decor was awesome and my husband liked his cod dish. Avoid this place at all cost and don't believe the hype - go to thirsty duck nearby instead - much better service, way better value for money and more consistent food."}
{"text":"Average food. Way over priced.  The food was almost stinky when it came out of the kitchen... Had a vinegar-Y smell almost like sour toes. Not sure if it was meant to be like that but it sure was potent.  Drinks were nice, I enjoyed the Pineapple #3.   Pricing was well over priced I mean with such small portions you would assume that things wouldn't be so crazily priced. Anyhow the interior is nice and all but I definitely won't go back because of the stinky food and high prices."}
{"text":"If you can - get a table at the kitchen \"show\" bar! Awesome energy! Okay  -- food wise all was delicious. Creative. Meticulous. Loved it all."}
{"text":"Sometimes you are lucky enough to have one if the best meals of your life on your birthday, and yesterday was one of those times for me! Every experience in this place is exceptional, from the decor and staff to the food and drinks. We started with the breads - 3 different house made delights that we devoured - and the spicy pickles. Delish. Then I had the green salad - crisp mix of romaine, kale, and a surprise favorite baby book Choy in a savory dressing- and my husband had the ham hock consommé soup - wonderful savory broth over tender ham on split peas. For main dishes he had the strip loin and I had the albacore tuna. Both were superb, and the accompaniments of tarragon butter for the steak and lemon marmalade for the fish were the perfect accents. Adding to the confusion of trying to pick our favorite part of the meal was the fact that the grilled broccoli with chili and anchovy and the crispy hasselback potatoes with chilled foie gras and truffle butter sides stood out on their own as feature dishes. For dessert I was presented with a sticky toffee cake with a candle for the occasion. Rounding out this meal was Curtis - the perfect waiter, funny, helpful, and excellent at his job. We will make a special trip to go back here!"}
{"text":"The staff here are amazing! And the food wasn't bad either!! We also had many wonderful cocktails!  Stake tartare 4/5, Burrata 5/5 ,Lasagna 3/5, Pork chop 5/5!"}
{"text":"It's not hard to find a patio in this city but it is hard to find a nice comfortable one with good light, good shade and bloody good food. I was here for brunch on a sunny Sunday to celebrate my brother in laws birth and the best pickled eggs I've ever had, even stole my sister's last one. Yes Maple Leaf Tavern does sound like a traditional pub, pickled eggs and all, but it is mostly anything but. I say mostly, because the one thing about a good pub that you can't do without is the comfort factor. That comfort factor though doesn't only come from a comfortable place to put your butt, it also comes from the service which was warm and welcoming, the menu which was simple, elegant (and very good) and the ambiance which as I'm sure you can guess kind of closes the deal.   So if you're looking for greasy pub food this is probably not for you but maybe you should give it a try, your tastebuds will thank you. They are busy in the evenings and with good reason, this is an east end favourite that we just can't let the east end keep to themselves any longer."}
{"text":"A particularly beautiful renovation.  A top notch menu, stellar wine list and great service.   A place that's genuinely surprising to those in the neighborhood.     Beautiful inside, with a great little patio on the right.    Arguably the very finest gastropub in the city.    Beyond expectations.   A spot the area eagerly needed.  Conveniently located within walking distance to the Gerrard/ Carlaw Smarttrack station that's scheduled to open in 2063.    The perfect antithesis to the urban decay and vermin filthpen that is Gerrard Square.     Recommended."}
{"text":"So great to have this spot in the neighborhood! Just had the first of hopefully many great dinners. Beautiful room, varied and unique menu and terrific service. Thank you for taking over this space."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Maple Leaf Tavern as it seems to be a popular staple of the east side of Toronto. When you walk in, you're greeted with a friendly hosted, a beautiful bar and interior, and a quaint patio. Judging a book by its cover, I expected this to be a great meal. Unfortunately, what we experienced was disappointing customer service coupled with below average plates.  My table ordered the burger, the cod, and the lasagna. The lasagna was very good, however both of the other dishes were very undercooked. The cod was so undercooked that part of it was fully raw. Our waiter avoided our table, so we told another server that two of the dishes were undercooked. They said they would tell our waiter.   Our waiter never followed up, as he would sprint past our table, Another waitress even had to take care of our bill. When she asked about our meal, I explained again the issues. She said she had her our waiter (who never checked with us) discussing this in the kitchen. So to be clear, he knew there were issues and unhappy customers, yet he didn't even check in with us.   Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is the KING of dive bars and a place to experience the dark corners of existence.   Really cheap beer!  The last time we went, it was midday and people were passed out with their heads on the tables. The rest of the patrons were watching Judge Judy!   It's a sad, sad place, but that's what makes it endearing."}
{"text":"This was my first time at the bar and even though I only ordered drinks it seemed like a nice vibe and very friendly bar staff. The inside liked a lot more swanky that I was expecting which is a plus. I plan to check it out some other time for food"}
{"text":"Toronto Life put this restaurant as one of the best openers last year and I had to try it out to see what the fuss was about.  The menu seemed approachable without a hefty chef menu price tag and it suited a nice casual time out.  It is an unusual part of Toronto... just on the outskirts of Chinatown East.  As you approach it, you can tell much love has gone into the restoration of it as it looks quite out of place from the surrounding areas.  I will say that if you're ever in this part of town, enjoy a good meal at this upscale gastro pub.  It might not be a destination meal for me but I would return to this every time I'm in the area.  We arrived early to the restaurant and just as it was setting, the amount of light filtering into the restaurant was really nice.  The restaurant is nicely done up ... definitely upscale but still quite a comfortable pub.  I really enjoyed sitting on the banquette as they were very comfortable.  We had lots of room to enjoy our meal without having our neighbouring table too close.  The menu was simple and yet enticing that it was very hard to choose.  We ended up choosing several items and nothing disappointed  In house spicy pickles (so good), green salad (with again.. pickled veg and shaved crisp vegetables. A solid salad), their daily vegetarian offering (This I loved... as someone who loves vegetables, the variety of textures and flavours was sooo good.  Loved the rapini, crisped potato, perfectly cooked egg...), and striploin perfectly cooked to order and very very well priced (8 oz for $24!).  We also got a very dull looking but incredibly flavourful peanut and chocolate mousse dessert.  It had brownie pieces and PB rice crispy squares inside it... fun dessert.  The prices definitely make it upscale but the service level and also food quality was well worth it.  I think they did a great job with the renovations and a great menu.  I would recommend to try this place any time you're in the east side!"}
{"text":"I visited Maple Leaf Tavern for the first time tonight (Valentine's Day). It was buzzing but not exceptionally busy, which is perfect for a high volume holiday such as today.   I really enjoyed my experience, except for one aspect - I was originally seated at a super tiny table that honestly could barely fit two people. You're expected to sit next to your date in a cramped booth. My date is over six feet tall and we physically could not fit and it was actually painful for me, such an awkward position! When I asked if I could please move, the server/hostess (?) was really rude about it...even though there were many free tables and of course, I'd had reservations for over a month. I hope that she gets a bit of customer service training on how to be a tad nicer/more understanding, in future.   However, we were eventually moved, and we got a new server - it will all uphill from there!   Delicious and fresh tasting food plus exceptional and attentive service from our server. Despite it being moderately busy, I never had to go five minutes without my water being topped up. He was really on the ball, without being annoying at all. Very pleasant demeanour.   Our meal started with the \"bread and butter\" appetizer and the spicy pickles. The pickles were legitimately massive. I couldn't even eat all of them!  The bread and butter was delicious, warm and fresh tasting.   My partner then ordered the wagyu steak ($49, I think?) with fries (extra cost) - and it was divine! Perfectly cooked, and the fries actually shocked me. I didn't know fries could taste so good. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The mayo that came with the fries was quite distinct tasting, and not bland whatsoever.   I ordered the cheeseburger and it definitely lived up to the hype. It's cooked medium rare, which I don't see often (if ever) in Canada. The juicy pink middle was perfection. A touch salty overall, but a solid 8.5/10 burger - I wasn't disappointed.   The desserts were outstanding. We got the peanut butter and chocolate \"hot and cold\" dessert, which has a nice flavour, texture, temperature contrast. We also got the sticky toffee pudding - this is NOT to be missed! By far the yummiest part of the meal (next to the mouth watering fries and mayo). I will say that the dessert is a very generous portion. I committed a borderline sin, and didn't finish my dessert! Definitely just get one to split, or save room!   In the end, our bill came up to $127 for two apps, two mains, one added side to a main (the wagyu steak comes solo without anything) and two desserts. I think this is quite reasonable, especially for Valentine's Day, when most places are doing costly fixed price menus. Keep in mind that we didn't order alcohol at all.   Overall, a very good experience with delicious food in a romantic, dimly lit, sexy atmosphere! Perfect date spot."}
{"text":"Superb service and great atmosphere! You can tell whoever runs the place is meticulous with the decor details, and in choosing their staff.  We were a party of four, so we were able to order a few things to try.  One of our friend loved his cheeseburger and fries, he said its one of the best burger he's had! He can tell the meat patty is fresh because of the texture and taste, and he loved the burger sauce. Even though we ordered the same dish, I find the patty was a tad salty for my liking, again it's a matter of personal preference.  My husband loved his lasagna, even though it's not your traditional lasagna with sheets of pasta. But he really enjoyed the mushroom flavour from the dish. He would definitely order it again next time.  The roasted cauliflowers, and honey and cumin carrots were amazing! Perfectly charred, flavored well and seasoned perfectly.   The cocktails were also really good, we had the Pisco Sour and Salty Dog.  Overall, love the atmosphere, really enjoyed the food, and we will definitely be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Great service. We had a table of 10 and the staff were great at making suggestions for food and drinks, never failed to refill water and drinks, and we're very attentive with out being overbearing.   I had the seared tuna with cauliflower side. The cauliflower was baked with a creamy cheese sauce that I ate every last drop! It was delicious and everyone who tried agreed. The drinks were all good (some of the cocktails were deceptively strong)  and the beer selection was fairly extensive. The tuna on the other hand is why I took off one star. The fish quality was fair but the plating left much to be desired. The tuna was essentially seared and cut in to strips and put on a plate, it was very visually unsatisfying. Even having it on a few leafy greens would have made it more worth the$20 price point.   Overall great dinner I'm definitely coming back to try some other items"}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Not impressed at all. Not much on the menu really appealed to me. Seemed to be missing some key staples for a brunch menu. Went with the avocado on toast and side of baked beans. Toast was definitely nothing special. Quite bland. I us to douse it with s + p and lime juice to improve the taste. Beans were okay. My friend had the yogurt berries oats bowl. Looked and tasted fine but nothing special for $10. Service was quite slow, uninformed. Fine bc we had lots to talk about and catch up on, but would have otherwise been annoying. While I'm curious about their dinner menu due to positive reviews, I won't bother to return. Not recommended for out of town visitors since it's in a pretty crappy area of town."}
{"text":"It's that week between Christmas and New Years where you're getting your winter bod on point and eating/drinking whatever comes your way. At least that's what I'm doing. I call it \"Orgy Week\" pertaining to food, not sex, ugh, deleted Tinder, too bloated for that. Besides I'm looking for something more serious, which basically means Netflix and starfish. Under the covers.  Anyway, my son Freddy is home from uni and we are blithely eating our way along Queen Street in Leslieville. Last night we were going to our favourite pizza place but they had gone fishing for the holidays so hopped back in the car for a new game plan.  I'd been meaning to try this place out since it rebirth from its previous incarnation so now was the perfect time. We got there at 6:30 and the hostess asked us if we had reservations. LOL. We were both wearing our baggy assed Roots sweatpants and our hair still matted from napping all day. We definitely looked out of place but whatevs, I had lipstick in my purse, I could fake it. We got to sit at the bar which is where I want to be at all times anyway.  Freddy was like \"this place is classy, we are in over our heads, mother.\"  I saw a burger with fries go by which was a relief, how fancy pants can it be? Also the guy beside me was drinking draught so we were in the right place fo sho. We both ordered the cheeseburger.  The beers on the menu were a sparsely curated of brews I had never heard of, though the ones in the bottles were equally obscure except for Steamwhistle. We both ordered a $9 Stone IPA on the tap which was really good but NOT a pint, ugh, I hate that, but whatevs.  The $20 burger was phenomenal. It was on a chewy sesame bun and the patty had some crunch on the outside and pink in the middle. Yes, rare, omg, the best. \"I like my burger well-done,\" I can hear some of you say. Grow up. The cheese and condiments, whatever was i there, were at one with each other. To be honest, I didn't even read the description in the menu as I forgot my readers and the floaters in my eyes get bad when I drink hard liquor over the holidays. The fries didn't disappoint either. Usually I don't eat them because I am from a small town in Quebec where greasy fries are sacred and come from little huts on the side of the highway and nothing else compares. But I ate these and without ketchup. Because they didn't offer it. The service was kind of hit and miss.  All in all, a lovely experience. A good date place for sure, not a Tinder date because it's too expensive to get drunk on $9 half pints, but maybe if you were on that Our Time or match dot com site and had stated you were a \"foodie.\" Ugh, aren't those people just the worst?"}
{"text":"An excerpt from a longer review...  \"This was not your grandfather's tavern--ambiance, execution and taste were kicked up a notch.  Take the whole Ontario burrata ($29), for example--a dish that was reason enough to visit. The generous portion of luscious cheese was made table-side with a drizzle of extra virgin canola oil, baco noir balsamic, Newfoundland sea salt and seasonal garnishes. Adornments of roasted turnips, delicate ribbons of raw butternut squash, zesty pesto and slivered almonds were aesthetically pleasing and also satisfied my tastebuds. High-quality burrata needs no adornment. One bite of the creamy cheese affirmed this...\""}
{"text":"Great food and services with nice wine selection. We had a course menu, and I had lamb croquette for appetizer, strip loin for main, and rice pudding for dessert. Strip loin tasted amazing and went well with red wine. Croquette was good, but was purely made up of meat and was bit dry; it would have been better if it had more vegetables. Rice pudding was another surprise, as it came deep fried. Although it did taste good, I would prefer more refreshing dessert. For wine, we had a Cabernet Franc from Niagara. It was an interesting full-body wine that has mix of sweetness, smokiness, and spiciness that gives complex flavour.  The staff were attentive and overall the restaurant had a nice atmosphere. It would suit various occasions for couples, workplace dinners, and families."}
{"text":"Based on the positive reviews on Yelp, we went to MLT for din.   The front foyer was paved with colorful crafted tiles. White table cloth tables. The place was classy.   The attentive hostess offered us to put away our coats when I obviously scouting for a place to hang my coat.   We ordered a few drinks from a rather cheerful gentleman. Beers from a cask were different for me. A quick review of their wine list, all drinks and cocktails appeared to be all in order. The price was your typical Toronto mark up. No complaints there.   The choices in the menu covered a large range of variety. Grilled meat, specialty pasta and etc. Beers had arrived. Only a pint and a half available. Another wait staff announced that the half pint is free. Free beer? We love free beer. I took the large one as my pal had to rush back to la belle province after dinner.  The beer tasted good.  Food was served and our night had gone down hill from here. Homemade sausages were served in slices. A few slices. They tasted alright, nothing ordinary. It was rather expensive for a few slices. The mushroom soup was ok, but I had better somewhere. Two of us ordered the \"la nouvelle\" lasagna for main. The dish was dried and burnt. I strongly suspected our serve forgot about dishes and left them under the tanning light for a bit. We had to wait for 45 minutes between our appetizers and mains.  I couldn't finish my main. It was really dried.   The bill came. We were charged for the half pint and a bottle red from the next table. The server was kind enough to take my beer off the bill. It was a nice touch.   Guess what?  We could not find our coats when we leave. The nice hostess had gone home for day. The server finally located the costs from the booths.  It was rather a negative experience."}
