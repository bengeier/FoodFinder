{"text":"The OMC sign out front boasts a pretty bold claim of best burgers in town.  Now, as a person that crafts his own burgers (to perfection I might add) I like to think that I have a pretty decent handle on what it takes to build a proper burger.

Unfortunately my first impression of the burger menu wasn't great.  For 'The best burgers in town' their burger menu is really lacking.  Now, having said that the online menu actually has about 8 beef and 8 chicken burgers, not bad.  When I was there however I only found 2 beef burgers.  Not sure if this is an update to the menu or if it was a different lunch menu, but it seems they've added a few options now.

I ordered the banquet burger with spicy fries.  The burger itself was a little dry.  Certainly nothing about it would make me think it was the best in town (and certainly didn't compare to my own)  But, all in all and for the price, it wasn't too bad.  The actual cafe itself had kind of a cool atmosphere and prices were really reasonable, so I may give it another chance some time

Edit:  Well now I\"m really confused the website actually shows a different address, and that explains the different menu.  Have they moved?"}
{"text":"I went there with a date for a fast meal and was so sick the next day. I got food poisoning from their pear salad with cheese.

I will not be going back ever again!
It was a terrible experience!"}
{"text":"Our hotel was right by this restaurant and we needed somewhere to stop before a trip to the Art Museum.    We walked in, at noon on a Sunday  and we were the only people there.  That never scares me- i prefer it, because i know it'll be quick.  
The bartender waitress was really sweet and friendly and helpful.  We told her we were out of towners and she gave us tons of advice, of places to go.  Back to the food- i had eggs and bacon and potoatoes- and it was the cheapest thing i ate the entire time in Toronto.  My husband did get a burger and the sweet potato fries and i can vouch for those, they were great.  I really liked this place for lunch.  highly recommend it for a quick brunch/ lunch spot.   - Not sure if there is more then one location, but i went to the one on Queen St."}
{"text":"Ok.  So, I'll just say that in terms of places to grab pub style food, this place is actually solid. 

I went recently *FOR LUNCH*  and I got the cheese burger, and while I was craving some onion rings, I went with sweet potato fries because the onion rings were of the frozen variety (though the waiter said they were good, Hm.). Off-topic, but I'd just like to say that at this point I feel to qualify for 3 stars the establishment in question HAS to have sweet potato fries.  This should just be a (Yelp) standard in this day and age, but I digress.

The burger was nice and big, good quality cheeses, and cooked nicely.  Good sweet potato fries, and plenty of them.  It was a good meal for ~$10.

My only criticisms are the choice of burger is pretty limited (only 2 on the menu at lunch that I could see) and it was, on a whole, kind of a boring burger.  Having said that however, I would come back without objection, just not top of my list.  Next time I'll check out the rings.

I should mention that this location is small.  So, during busy times you may not get a seat.  Also, the service was pleasantly abrupt.  Normally I'd be put off by this, but in this case the guy was just too busy to put up with a lot of hmm'ing and haa'ing, so he took care of something and came back.  Plus, this place has the vibe of \"man's man\" eatery so it's all business.  I could see people being put off by it, but it was fine with me.

That's it!"}
{"text":"The drinks are kinda on the pricey side - the one thing that really pisses me off about this place is that they don't do pitchers!! ugh (except in the summer months). 11 pints of Creemore will set you back about $75... 

The food is good - there's daily specials like 1c steak, 45c wings, half-price fish & chips, $3.99 burgers & fries, etc. The clientele goes from suits (after work hours) to homeless (sometimes, at night)....but it's near my apartment and I do end up here more often than I'd like to admit. 

It's warm and it's cozy. The waitresses (there's usually only one at a time) are friendly and are on top of things. There's also a jukebox (needs some updating with the classic rock n roll selection though) that I've spent countless change on. It tends to be rather empty at nights since it's on the tail end of Queen St. and the clubbers coming into the city are headed to Richmond St. But hey, like I said it's near my apartment and it's an ok place to have a few drinks (just have to remind myself to go easy on the pints, lol)."}
