{"text":"The only reason I give any stars at all is because of our server.  I think her name was Jill, (dreadlocks).   She did everything but stand on her head to make sure our experience was pleasant and positive.   The rest of the place, ehhh, the management, not so great.  If the owners had a clue, they'd put dreadlocks in charge of the place and have her train the rest of the employees on how to do things and keep it upbeat.  Will we be back??? Maybe  if dreadlock is working.  Great space, just needs some staff."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday with my husband to watch the Steelers game. The floor is disgustingly sticky (some frat houses have cleaner floors) and the air is stale. My husband grabbed a beer on the way in at a cash-only tub and thank goodness he did - we waited for a bartender to acknowledge us at the bar to get another beer, a shot and a soda. Then we went to one of the bars in the backside (of the front bar). Waited a bit for another round of drinks. I was finally able to grab a barstool, no fault of TC - it was busy.   I wanted to grab some food so I tried to get the attention of one of three bartenders, two of which were BS'ing together and twirling their hair.  The menu on game day is normal - you can't expect a ton of options on one of the busiest days. I paid $11 for their cheese/bacon FF. The portion was extremely small and it looked as if it sat for some time under a heat lamp.    My husband ordered another beer and, granted the bartender did warn us the bar was slanted and if the bottle got wet, it might slip - but she did not give him a cocktail napkin to prevent the condensation to collect on the bottom and it slid right into my lap. I'm 5 months pregnant, didn't have a drop of alcohol but smelled like a brewery.   Also, they need to make sure to monitor the intoxication level of patrons. There were a few fights which were broken up quickly and the individuals taken to the back. There were also a lot of individuals that could hardly stand straight. I'm also a certified bartender with the proper training to pick out the drunks and prevent them from becoming a problem either in the establishment or on the street, they need to pay better attention to the safety of everyone and the liability of the bar.   Definitely a place to go crazy, have fun and get in trouble. I doubt I'll back, pregnant or not."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great country music. Place starts getting busy around 10pm. if  you dare ride the bull. all they ask is for a tip"}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us stopped by for the football games and the place was busy but not packed. Upon entering, the hostess told us to sit anywhere and we had no trouble finding a table. After waiting 15 minutes for a waitress I realized that I would have to walk back and forth to the bar for my food and drink orders. The drinks were good but if you go on a Sunday, expect a limited game day food menu. The soft pretzels were delicious. The burger and wings that we ordered were pretty basic. Again, this was the game day menu so I can't judge the menu as a whole. The restrooms were very clean and the attendant was very friendly. For some reason the floors were super sticky up by the tequila bar. I am definitely going to give this place a second shot because I understand growing pains and new staff. Plus I'd like to try their complete menu."}
{"text":"If you like margaritas that taste like they were mixed with bottom shelf tequila and green kool-aid, I would highly recommend the 32 oz. Food was mediocre. Three bars seems unnecessary and confusing because they only serve certain drinks at some. The crowd was obnoxious. The service was friendly and prompt, which the only reason I can give any stars to this disaster of a place."}
{"text":"Bouncers let me in and then while my group was singing karaoke bouncers came up to us and asked for our IDs again. Bouncers and the \"manager\" stated that my ID was fake and if I was unable to provide a 2nd photo ID I would have to leave. I didn't have a 2nd form but many other cards, including two credit cards and my health insurance card, with my name on it. They said that the \"font on my ID was too small and it was obviously a fake\". This was all from an overheard conversation that a friend I were having in the bathroom which lead to employee to report us. I allowed the bouncer to walk me out but it was a member of our party's birthday and the group asked to talk to the bouncer again.  After they looked at my ID again they stated that \"it was a DMV error and I should have it reprinted\". They quickly backtracked on their story and allowed me back in... all without an apology. I have been to Tequila Cowboy most of my weekends, but vow to never return and will inform all of my friends and family about the rude staff and policies. I understand that laws are strict but I have never been treated so unfairly or rudely by the staff of a bar before."}
{"text":"What a cool Bar/Restaurant.   Friday night happy hour - patrons of all ages.  Good service at the bar - plenty of places to sit. Free rides on the bull. Three big bar areas ..very spacious and so colorful and fun!!   Little Red Corvette bar was cute - but lacked a crowd.  I look forward to going back and trying to food and making an evening out of it."}
{"text":"I can not figure out what all the hype is about here? Long line to get in on Friday/Saturday night, over priced drinks, long bathroom lines, shoulder to shoulder in every room you go, and long wait for drinks.  Typically, the floor is so sticky your shoes stick to the floor. I've gotten food here while watching the steelers play, nothing impressive, just your typical bar food. The only good things about tequila cowboy is the outdoor bar & the wide selection of music. Depending on what room you're in, you'll hear anything from country to rock to 90s favorites or pop hits. What I hate most is there is only 1 bathroom and it's in the far back left corner making it difficult to get to from outside or the front bar with a limited number or stalls, long long line and always out of TP! Seriously ladies, bring your own in your purse. I personally only come here if I am with a group who won't go anywhere else bc of the lines, bathroom situation and drink prices. In my opinion, you're better off going somewhere else in the north shore.  Fun bar to try a few times, but not to be a regular."}
{"text":"Last night I went to tequila cowboy for my 25th birthday. I was having a fun time then around 12:30 I went to go to the bathroom. As I leave the bathroom two men are standing there and grab my arm and said \"let's go\" so I asked what I did. The only response was \"you know what you did. You're in the wrong bathroom\" I was confused. I am a female with short hair. I tried to show them my Id but instead I got told to shut up and leave. I'll never go back to that place again."}
{"text":"Fun country bar to people watch and dance and drink. We went before the Kenny Chesney concert and had a blast. Watching people on the mechanical bull never gets old. Super convenient location to Heinz Field."}
{"text":"Always a good time with live music and a DJ, but there are a few issues with this place.  The bar doesn't allow the bands to play past 11. Most people who go out go at 10. If you want to hear the band plan on arriving at 8! The bands should be able to play all night and the DJ should play in another room since there are three.  Another big issue is it is so hot! There is very little air flow.  Ladies take note; there is only one bathroom! That's unheard of for such a huge bar. Please open another bathroom! People who drink need a bathroom!   There is no coat check. Don't wear a coat or you will carry it all night."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. They played a lot of throwbacks when I visited on a Friday night. It is a very big place and gets really packed. Also, if you are going to the bathroom it seems like a maze trying to get to it."}
{"text":"It's a Tuesday night, there's barely anyone here. It took 30mins to get our chicken tacos. The Kentucky Mules were delicious, but we had to ask the bartender if we could order another drink after half an hour went by, because she never checked on us. We asked for a tequila list, and they don't have one, and there are only two bottles visible at the main bar even though it's called \"Tequila Cowboy.\" We were told that there's a tequila bar on the weekends, if we wanted tequila. So, we drank whiskey. My fianc√©e had to go to a table & grab silverware, plates, napkins and salt & pepper, because they didn't bring us any with our food at the bar. The food was decent, and there really aren't any qualms with the kitchen. Stick to partying here on the weekends. That's probably more in their wheelhouse."}
{"text":"On a day where every person is Irish in da'burgh, I was pleasantly surprised by how nice the bartenders were at the \"Tequila bar\" especially the rockin female bartender Caitlyn!"}
{"text":"Came here Monday after a pirates game. They passive aggressively closed the garage doors on the people outside and did last call at 11:45 even though they close are 12. Drinks were overly sugary and were not strong. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Week two and the floors are already sticky like a bad college bar.  Don't bring the south side and Station Square to the Northshore.  Food isn't bad just need to pay attention to details."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. Steelers game wasn't until 8p, so not crowded at all. After we saw the very limited game day menu we decided to just drink the beers we ordered and go somewhere else for lunch. After about 20 min of waiting for our beer and the server walking by multiple times not saying anything we got up and left. Also, they were out of yuengling. On a game day. When we asked the server if they had bottles she had no idea. One plus was I left my ray bans there and when I came back from my lunch across the street, the bartender had them for me. Also floor was insanely sticky and they probably had only been open for an hour or two? Strange experience."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying that Tequila Cowboy is not my typical scene, in which I prefer a more laid back setting if I'm going to go to a bar. However, Tequila Cowboy satisfies the absence of dance clubs in Pittsburgh and as such, it draws a HUGE crowd to the North Shore. It's nice seeing people gather there even when there aren't any games or events at the stadiums. With that said, it is incredibly difficult to get a drink and it's tough getting around the several themed rooms they have. From what I could tell, they have a country room, a karaoke bar, and a 90s themed music room. There are people everywhere you turn. So I get it, large crowds are expected at dance clubs but like other Yelpers pointed out, it makes it incredibly difficult to find the bathroom since they only have ONE! For a space this large and so intricately laid out, you'd think they'd have a bathroom in each themed space. FYI, the bathroom is in the karaoke bar.   This isn't my scene so I personally won't be returning often, but I can see how Tequila Cowboy would be a great place for a night out for some folks."}
{"text":"Decent drinks. The bartenders in the back really took care of us tonight. Super nice people. It was not excessively crowded, however it was increasing as the night went on. The bull is super fun! The place does have some older gentleman out on the dance floor who clearly are chasing a younger crowd. Not my usually Friday night hangout."}
{"text":"Worst bar on earth. The crowd is terrible aggressive trash. The service and security are poor. Drinks are bad. Avoid this place like the plague, worst place in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Honestly I came to Tequila Cowboy after the last Steeler game on a Sunday afternoon. We didn't eat anything, so there isn't a food review.  The bar is setup very well for the types of crowds that it attracts. There were a lot of people in this bar and there was plenty of space on the dance for. The 90s bar is pretty cool but a lot of people cram on there because the outside bar is connected to it. If you can get through there and hit the larger inside bar you'll be set. They have at least 3 bars that you can buy drinks and food, so you can get a drink pretty quickly. They have tables if you want to sit down and just try to relax. A bit hit is the bull you can ride. I think it's based on donations and it's pretty fun. The line isn't usually too long. I think over all it's a good bar to visit on game day or Saturday night !"}
{"text":"I understand that yesterday was an exceptional day because of the Pens parade...but knowing as such, every restaurant in town should have been prepared!  Tequila Cowboy was NOT! I was laughing after we first sat down that I had noticed the servers were intentionally not making eye contact with people as they passed, so that nobody would try to get their attention.  When the server did finally make it over to our table, she informed us that the manager screwed up and only scheduled 2 servers for that shift?!?!?    So for the remainder of this review, go off the premise that yes, this manager who created the schedule should be fired immediately!   The server was nice enough for how busy they were, and we put in our food order with the drinks the first time she came over, since it had taken a while to get her there in the first place...Now keep in mind, we ordered 2 chicken quesadillas, a hot dog, and chicken fingers...nothing complicated AT ALL. So there we sat...and sat...and sat...and sat...and sat...and sat...and sat...we watched other tables come in and get their food, which looked more complicated than ours, eat, and leave...we sat...and sat...and sat...after an hour and a half, I went and found our server who told me it might be another 20 minutes?!?!?  20 minutes is all it should have taken for this order in the first place!  Then as the 2 hour mark approached, out came 3 of the 4 meals...missing was my quesadilla, because all I wanted in mine was the chicken and cheese...I know I know, VERY complicated. The server went in the back, where I assume she yelled at the cook to get my food out there, where I again assume his response was something like, \"Fine!  I'm not even gonna cook it then!\"  Because when she brought out my quesadilla, after the first bite I realize the chicken is COLD...not just cool...COLD...and the cheese wasn't even melted AT ALL!!!  Literally, it was cold chicken and shredded cheese inside a shell?!?!?  At this point, I ask the server to send the manager over...He comes over to tell us about the parade...yes, we know about the parade, we were there...bottom line is you were not prepared while you should have been!  I'm guessing by his attitude that he was the idiot who made the schedule, and is the one who should be fired himself.  He tried to give some BS answer that even if he had 2 or 3 more cooks scheduled that it wouldn't have made any difference...which was quite laughable!  Needless to say, I did not pay for this quesadilla though!  This would not have happened at Burgatory or any of the other restaurants that know how to properly schedule their employees!  I guess we found out the reason why we were able to find a table right away at this place!  Next time, just wait a little bit longer for a table at a better restaurant!"}
{"text":"Waiting 15 minutes for anyone to even bring us a menu even though when we walked in the waitress told us to \"sit wherever\" so you'd think she would have realized we were sitting somewhere.   When we finally did see the menu it was the \"game day\" menu. Offerings printed on a word document included soft pretzel, chicken sandwich, and loaded fries. Basically screamed \"prepare to be disappointed.\" That plus that loud talking drunk smoker blowing his cigarette in my face was enough of a sample for me.   We left and went to Burgatory. Probably won't give it another chance."}
{"text":"Visiting from the UK , had a fantastic night Wednesday 13th  , I.D was asked which I produced a Valid Government issued driving licence  allowed entry had 3 drinks good time . Thursday tried to recreate the same great experience with 2 American gay friends and refused on the grounds my Government issued driving Licence was not valid, I fail to see the difference other than certain stereotypical groups are not welcome"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight! So much security. I definitely felt safe! Ordered 4 drinks 27$ total for all. Not bad prices. The staff was very nice! The place was packed! Seemed popular with all ages crowds. Wish we could've stated longer. Loved all the different bars. They have kareoke... sucks per usual haha the drinks were strong and made to order. Quick! Didn't get a chance t o try food. Looks great tho.  The bull was entertaining and hilarious!"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped here for a drink and some appetizers before attending a concert at stage AE. the appetizer were delicious and very reasonable in price. However the serve was mediocre at best. We could finish our beer before he came back to check in on us. It also took an unreasonable amount of time to cash out. We had to approach another server and request our check because our server was no where to be seen. I may return to a drink or two at the bar but will never come again for a meal."}
{"text":"The douchebag bouncer called my friend fat after I got kicked out. Totally uncalled for. And not to pull rank, but I've been on Maury before so that was a mistake."}
{"text":"The service is sub par, the drinks are over priced, the bar is over crowded. These are all things to be expected of a trendy place. The thing that really got me was I showed up at 11 47, an employee told me the kitchen closed at midnight and when I asked the bar tender for a menu she said the kitchen was closed. It says online the kitchen closes at midnight...I understand wanting to be done with a shift, but that's just ridiculous."}
{"text":"My friends and I have a great time here each time we go to TC. Great music, fun crowd, and an overall awesome atmosphere. However, I have to reiterate all of the comments regarding long bathroom lines, poor bar service, and weak overpriced drinks. They really should consider adding more restrooms for an establishment of this size. This past Friday we were paying $23 for a round of 3 drinks. Nothing special or top shelf. Very weak. You can definitely find stronger and cheaper drinks about anywhere else."}
{"text":"Bartender with tattoos and man bun REFUSED to call us a can when we said we couldn't drive....said we had 4 people we could use our own phones....our phones were dead which we told him...he was terrible and should be FIRED! Thank you to Jackie nice female bartender who eventually did call us a cab!"}
{"text":"I have had multiple bad experiences here, mainly for it being way too overpriced and having a rude, inattentive staff. The only thing that it has in its favor is the location."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I brought my family in from New Jersey and wanted them to see the Tequila Cowboy and they wouldn't let us in because one of them had a Giants scarf on. You embarrassed my city."}
{"text":"So spent the day in Pittsburgh Saturday and went to Tequila Cowboy, not once but twice.   It's cool, man. We went for drinks before the Pirates game and then met some friends there after, later that night. Before it was modestly busy for the downtown area and we were able to get a seat at the bar immediately. I was also able to ride on the mechanical bull immediately. ;)  Prices were cheap, it was super touristy and they have all kinds of local beers. Loved it especially the nightlife crowd. It does get packed, but it's huge indoors and there's a karaoke bar, a tequila bar, and multiple dance floors. It does get packed, but there are enough bartenders at hand to get to everyone!  As a non-local it was exactly what I was looking for, for a mini-vacay.   Go to Tequila Cowboy for the country jams, booze, and good times."}
{"text":"This is a nightlife type of bar. It's a fantastic addition to the North Shore. It's a huge space with multiple bars and rooms. If you go there looking for a nice place to eat, with great service, you might be disappointed. If you go for the drinks and entertainment, you won't regret it. I went Friday night and had a blast. The country singers were awesome and I didn't even have to pay cover to see them perform! That's unheard of these days. I hope that continues but as long as they keep the place clean/semi-classy, I'll keep going."}
{"text":"My husband and I had some drinks before attending the Steelers game. We had great service at the bar and loved how the bar had a live band playing. Not from Pittsburgh area but would recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"3 stars is me being generous. I don't HATE tequila cowboy, but I will certainly not ever voluntarily come here. To me, TC is a glorified frat party. It is huge inside with 4(?) bars under one roof..... and one restroom with a line that has been 30-40 girls deep every time I've been there. It makes absolutely zero sense. Drinks are extremely pricey as to be expected in the North Shore. It is packed on game days and weekends. It draws a very random crowd, and there's nothing wrong with that, but this bars entire scene is just not really my style. I'll stop in if my friends want to but other than that, I prefer other spots in the city.   Oh, but their Bloody Mary is actually the best I've ever had. If for no other reason you go to TC.... go for the bloody."}
{"text":"Food was as expected it was the fast service on the forth of July that is getting them a 4 star rating. If your in a hurry and not looking for something special this is the place for you."}
{"text":"It is definitely way over crowded in the weekend or in a game night even this place is quite spacious! There are multiple bar areas inside and a singing bar as well. The food was standard."}
{"text":"I definitely had a great time here. I actually didn't eat here I came to watch a band play and drink. The one thing I found odd was that where the stage/dance floor was there was a couple tables in the middle of the dance floor with people eating at them. It was a little annoying because we were trying to dance but there was a table right in front of us. Another problem I had there was the wait time for drinks. It took forever to order a drink. Other than that the place was great. Lots of security that kept traffic moving, drinks weren't over priced, and all 3 bars were awesome."}
{"text":"Went to this place because it's new. It was a little confusing that its one huge bar under two names. The place only has one bathroom way in the back for around 300 people.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and the overall chaos of karaoke section, mechanical bull, multiple dance stages, multiple bars.   I was disappointed by the amount of alcohol the place either ran out of or didn't carry. I was told that they ran out of tequila? I'm like, but the name is tequila cowboy. I mean either the bartender is lying or they can't figure out how to stock.   There was definitely a lack of hustle behind the bars it took about 15-20 minutes to get a drink everytime. I had an appetizer of loaded fries and it was everything I could have wanted.   Music was great. Definitely catering to the 90's crowd.  Saw quite a few people getting throw out. Guess they can't keep the place under control with security.  Likely to come back just not gonna spend money on drinks"}
{"text":"Over priced. Over crowded. Over rated. This place has to be violating occupancy standards."}
{"text":"I've been force to go to this bar three times. And every time has been awful. Crowded, overpriced, and filled with absolutely trashed people. The men who work security are rude and overly aggressive. I don't know where they think they work but they take it too serious. I had a friend try and go back in to find another friend .. only to be tackled! He almost hit his head off the patio furniture. When I complained to the other guards all they asked \"is he dead? Then he's fine.\""}
{"text":"I've come here about three times since I've moved back to Pittsburgh and have had a great experience each time I've come. It's definitely a mixed age group (I've seen people 21-50), and it's always a fun vibe. One time I came they had a DJ, and another they had a live band. I love that they have two separate rooms (one with country music, and one is a karaoke bar.) It's definitely fun to walk around, drink, and dance with your friends. The staff is always super nice, and the guys at the door are always so welcoming! (Thanks Victor!!!)"}
{"text":"Woah...    I have lived in Pittsburgh for a few years and was not aware of this place (not my typical place).   Let me set the scene.  I met some friends who recommended this place to watch the College League Playoff Games.   Now this is not the place to watch football games (or better yet to listen to the games).   There are multiple bars in the location.  While watching the game, it felt like 1000 Santa Clauses walked in.  Apparently there was a Santa Claus Bar Hop going on.   What made this even more amusing was that Tequila Cowboy has a mechanical bull.   The thought of seeing drunk Santa Clauses on a Mechanical Bull was great comedy.  The overall experience was one of fun on a Saturday afternoon.   Drinks were good and Santa Clauses were fun to watch.     They appear to have live bands that will play and is probably why the place gets really crowded at night.   We were early enough to not feel the crowd.     Pro's - Huge - Good drink selection - We could watch the game (not hear it) - Had a great atmosphere / good time  - Live Music  Con's - Gets crowded - I kept getting lost finding / returning from the restroom (the place is like a maze)  All in all - I will visit again but probably during the day."}
{"text":"This place is really unique and Big. Not a bad place stop by for a drink or even get food. I had the chicken and waffles and they were amazing. Staff were super nice and on top of it."}
{"text":"I have been to Tequila Cowboy several times, and I enjoyed the experience! Last night was a night that entirely shifted my perception of this establishment. I'm patiently waiting in line just like everyone else. I have my ID in my hand ready to give to the bouncer. I am a 22-year-old biracial woman from MD. The bouncer somehow immediately begins questioning my age after he attempts to break my REAL ID. He was a meathead so naturally he could bend anyone's ID with his bare hands. My REAL ID does not break despite his efforts. I tried to reassure him of my age and told him I did not appreciate him trying to break my real ID that I paid $50 for at the MVA and obviously need to drive around. I was slightly annoyed as anyone would be. Here I am, a college graduate with her own apartment, and I'm still being questioned about my age. I told the bouncer I had every right to be there just like everyone else. He then proceeded to tell me I had an \"attitude\" and I wouldn't be allowed in with my \"fake\" ID. He became very aggressive and angry when he spoke to me saying I shouldn't be talking to him any kind of way. All I could think of was what way was I supposed to be talking to someone that was rudely trying to tell me my age and destroy my property in front of me.   I ask him to speak with the manager politely. Before the manager even approaches me, he speaks with the bouncer. He fails to really listen or hear me out when I tell him what happened. I explained I was there for a friend's birthday, which I unfortunately missed, and that I had been there several times before. I asked him what more I had to do to prove my age. The bouncer then grabs a MD ID from a woman in the crowd. He doesn't bend her ID nearly as hard as he bent mine so he deems mine fake. What's worse?! He tells me people like me are a \"problem\" so I can't be allowed in. The manager then explains that people have been using fake MD IDs to get in and they questioned the line in the middle of my ID. Disclaimer: If this bar has been letting MD IDs in without the line down the center, then those IDs are fake. MD recently added the line down the center to make it easy to identify real IDs from fake IDs. Anyways, I am told to leave.   I proceed to find a police officer to verify my age. The officer took my ID and confirms that I am 22 years old. He walks over to the bouncer and lets him know that I am 22 years old and I have every right to get in that bar. The bouncer told the police officer that he still wouldn't be letting me in because I had an \"attitude.\" All I could think then was this was what being a black woman with curly hair and asserting yourself to a pompous asshole gets you in this life. The police officer kindly apologized and told me they wouldn't be letting me in. He even agreed that other women they were letting in looked younger than me, but said the business had the right to deny me service. I thanked the police officer, but I couldn't believe what I heard. This business discriminated against me.   As I'm leaving and on the phone explaining to my friend how I wouldn't make it to her birthday, I see a young woman intoxicated beyond all recognition being brought out of the bar by 4 men yet I'm the PROBLEM! All I can say is that Tequila Cowboy needs to train their bouncers to not carry biased notions about people and to respect their patrons and their patrons' property. They also need a class on how to tell a fake ID from a real ID. What happened to me last night was unacceptable and unethical on their part! I would not suggest going to this bar! My whole perception of this place changed last night! I most likely will never be returning and I will definitely be sharing this story with my friends and family. I am well connected with restaurant owners and bartenders here in Pittsburgh as well so I'm going to be sure to tell this story to my contacts. Unethical business here! I have never been treated the way I was treated last night at Tequila Cowboy by any bar in Pittsburgh. Based on the Yelp and Facebook reviews, the bouncers are violent and aggressive and management is piss poor. My experience can be added to the long list of individuals that were mistreated and abused by the staff at this bar."}
{"text":"Super great experience here the other night, Kristen is a great bartender and will be back hoping she is working! Awesome happy hour specials, best nachos in the city and very relaxing to be able to sit outside under the awning, made me feel like I was on vacation and didn't have to work the next day. Thanks again Kristen for the exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Diverse crowd age-wise. This place is huge, and the outdoor fires are pretty lit (no pun intended). They have many rooms with different music genres. We never have a problem getting drinks, and my friends usually hang in the 90s room - they play the best throw backs. HOWEVER if you do go to TC get there at or before 10:30. After 11:00 there's always a massive line to get in. Sometimes it moves fast, sometimes it doesn't move at all."}
{"text":"Reviews for Steelers pregame only. We had a really good time here before the play off game v Jacksonville. Place is absolutely huge, plays good music (not all country) and the bathrooms really didnt have any lines. Servers and bartenders were slammed but they have done this before and served as a quickly as they could. Great place to get out of the brutally cold weather and enjoy some drinks before the game. Place was packed to the roof with Steeler fans"}
{"text":"I would give a zero if it let me. We walked in and decided to leave because it was crowded. We have been here several times. When we left to go to our car there was a girl who might have been 21 sitting outside the back door.  She had vomit all over her. The security guards were aware she was sitting out there alone. I discovered this after I asked if she was ok. Her friends then proceeded to come outside and yell at me.  I did call the police.  I can't believe this is the kind of thing that you allow and your security guards are involved.  After seeing this behavior you all should be shit down. The security guards told the police to harass us. After we spoke to the police and they saw that we were sober they went back to that situation and we left."}
{"text":"This is an updated review. I deleted my old review because it is no longer relevant, the bathrooms are now clean with a friendly attendant on duty. I went to the Sundance Head concert here last night and it was fantastic. What an awesome venue for music and dancing. I also had dinner, a chicken dish that was pretty good. The chicken cutlets were breaded with a lemony piccata style sauce. They were served with asparagus spears and mashed potatoes. The potatoes were from dehydrated, but I liked them. I had a wonderful time. Thank you for fixing the bathroom issue TC!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by tequila cowboy. I never even knew they had food! A friend and I stopped in for a Thursday happy hour. The service was quick and the deals were nice (5 dollar apps and 2 dollars of drafts & more). We had the nachos and the boneless wings to start. Both were good, the wing portion was small. For our meals she had the cheeseburger and I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. My sandwich was SO large and tasty. Much more spicy than I've ever had, but that's a good thing because I really enjoy spice. We will be back for the food! (Not just the party at night)"}
{"text":"We were at Heinz Stadium for U2 concert and went in to grab a quick bite.  Don't go here!  They don't seat you. Tables were packed.  We were told that you had to get a server's attention to put in an order.  Food was mediocre and for a place called Tequila Cowboy, they have a limited  selection of tequila.  The only reason they were busy b cause of concert."}
{"text":"I have been to Tequila Cowboy a number of times whether it was to eat, go out and drink with my friends or to watch a Pitt game after a day of tailgating. I have to say, I have enjoyed most if not all of my excursions here. The best part about this place is that there are three bars within, so you can move around all night. Each room's theme plays a different genre of music so it really is a great place for most crowds. I also really love the outdoor area. Highly recommend getting the original margarita -- they are strong and delicious for what you pay. Love TC!"}
{"text":"Nina, Blair Jones and manager DJ are absolute class. My game was having difficulty coming on and the did their best to accommodate. They tried repetitively.Good people great fried pickles and cold beer. I give my highest recommendation."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good drinks.  Too crowded to move or sit anywhere but that does mean it is popular and a good place."}
{"text":"Reviewing on service and drinks only. Zach was great. Megan was training with him. They were very attentive. We had a group during the day and recommend sitting outside."}
{"text":"Three of us walked in on a Friday night around 5:30. No one was at the hostess stand, we stood around for a few minutes and then went up to the bar to ask if we could just sit where ever. But no one at the bar even came up to us, so we just sat down outside. It took about 15 minutes for a waitress to come over. Service was slow the whole night, my friends got their food and I had to wait about 10-15 mins for my bowl of chili. My friend of chips and dip, and I got a lot more tortilla chips with my chili than he did his chips and dip. The chili was decent. My other friend asked for sour cream and never got it. Overall, the service needs to be improved, perhaps more servers? and the food was what you would expect."}
{"text":"I was in town for a work conference, this place was recommended to my friends. The bar has all types of music & things to do - live country in the bigger section,80's music in another room, karaoke and I heard there was a bull ( I didn't see this). They close at 2am, the bartenders were fast pouring drinks. It was nice!"}
{"text":"Went Fri. If I could go for 0 stars, I would. The only thing that DIDN'T blow about this bar was the woman working the bull & the one in the restroom. A /rail/ whiskey is $6.50. The crowd is a bunch of snotty barely legals (I'm saying that at 26), they're a \"country\" venue that seems to play mostly pop, & they refuse to play   line dances, including not playing Wobble/Cupid Shuffle/etc. The floors are INCREDIBLY sticky, & where it's not sticky, it's bad enough to fall. A security guard came up to me & informed me I needed to put my vape away (not being used, just on the table). The only upside was that I didn't have to pay a cover. A lot of people would love it, just not any adults, people who actually enjoy country (Maybe change the bar's name?) or anyone who doesn't want drinks dumped on them by snotty girls."}
{"text":"This place has the most horrid  management I have ever come across. They wouldn't take a personal identification card that is legal valid identification. I wish I could give them no stars because they don't even deserve any. I left without giving them my business because they were so rude to my friend and I. I am going to tell all of my friends in the area not to give them their service anymore."}
{"text":"This isn't a 5-star restaurant. It's just the kind of novelty place you stop in and have a few drinks. With that said, I personally enjoyed the food I had here before Saturday nights Pirates game. The place was packed (as it always is) and we navigated our way through all the bars until we found a vacant table. There really is no seating system, you kind of wander around until you find an empty table. A little bit of a cluster.  I ordered the Jolly Roger, which was a sub with pierogies, kielbasa, and mustard. It was large and good. Other people in my party ordered the chili dog (monstrous and good), and the chicken fingers, which weren't that impressive. Lots of drink options. I ordered an Iron City pounder and it wasn't exactly cold... so that stunk. But, our service was on point considering the waitress had a full and large section to cover. She was great.   It's just a very cool atmosphere, like I said a country novelty type place. I know the line at night to get in is around the building. One of the hot night life spots for 20 something year olds. But, for a 6pm spot to grab a bite to eat before a game and drink some brews... it was fine."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after seeing it being built during my visit to Pittsburgh last summer.  After about 15 mins of waiting  and not getting served we left.  A few doors down is Burgatory who not only got us seated right away but also took our order right away."}
{"text":"Staff here is so rude. You would think as a normal adult you would know not to touch other people's possessions. However, one of the staff here just nonchalantly began removing my coat from the chair it was on without any warning. When I approached him and said, \"hey that's my coat,\" he rudely I formed me they had a coat check tossed my coat at me and took the chair away. Dear sir there is this thing called manners and asking before you touch peoples items."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday during happy hour with a friend. We each tried two different flavor margaritas (my favorite was the mango) that were larger than my head, they were absolutely delicious and very cheap considering! Also had some nachos that hit the spot, definitely coming back soon.  Great addition to the bar scene in Pittsburgh!!"}
{"text":"Friend and I went to get food and drinks. They wouldn't accept our completely valid Pennsylvania drivers licenses because my friend's very long name covered the picture of herself at the bottom right of the ID. She has been served before with no problem. Although I understand a discrepancy with an ID, it was the way we were treated by the staff that was unacceptable. 3 different people checked our ID's and when we were denied, the man who told us was extremely condescending, and I then saw the rest of the staff staring at us as whispering as we processed this very weird moment. Totally unprofessional."}
{"text":"Tequila Cowboy is a great place to have fun and listen to live music with your friends. The menu has a large variety of items to choose from and the food is amazing. The drink menu and beer selection has something for everyone. I enjoyed the 32oz. Mango Margarita which was very refreshing!!! The happy hour prices are the best I have seen, Monday-Friday 4PM-7PM.  This place is built for people of all ages to come and have a great time!!!!! Keep in mind that the Little Red Corvette room is open for lunch during the week as well. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I can't wait to go back and ride the bull!!!!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's nightlife hasn't been the same since the closure of the numerous clubs in Station Square, which is now a parking lot. Whim had memories. If you went to Whim and couldn't find something you liked, you just needed stay indoors but with that void comes great opportunity. Nashville based Tequila Cowboy saw that opportunity and immediately seized it.   Walking into the establishment, I was immediately aware that Pittsburgh didn't have anything like Tequila Cowboy. It reminded me of the many Texas clubs I've encountered while briefly living there a few years ago.  What makes Tequila Cowboy special is the fact that it's several bars in one. The main bar features a mechanical bull , which is loads of fun and no worries about dying because you're surrounded by a sea of foam. Then if you keep walking you'll enter WannaB's;  this karaoke bar is a great time and you'll soon learn that if you don't know how to sing you're good and if you don't know a country song just pick what you do know and the DJ will kindly play it. The staff here is so friendly that they'll have you coming back even if they don't have free samples in tow. Although, they didn't offer any food you could buy I did try the boneless chicken bites, which smelled spicier than they appeared (thank goodness) and me and my girlfriends devoured them.  After you get tired of the mechanical bull, the live band, the karaoke at WannaB's and the dance floor do indulge in their crazy long selection of drafts on tap. I loved the fact that Tequila Cowboys included local craft brews even though I preferred Angry Orchard. I was glad to have options. Not one staff member made me feel out of place and I was shocked on my way out and noticed that their patio has a fire pit, which will definitely come in handy on cool Pittsburgh days. It's one of three nightlife places that has a fire pit which is a huge bonus.  After enjoying the live music, the guitars on the ceiling, the awesome drinks, the dancing and the mechanic bull, I will definitely be checking out Tequila Cowboy again. I have a bone to master that mechanical bull even if the staff is managing it! Pittsburgh needed a great dance floor and Tequila Cowboy saw it and seized it."}
{"text":"Ask for Darkel, he was was A++++!! We had the deep fried deviled eggs, they were delicious! I also recommend the Any Given Sunday.. comes with pop-rocks around the rim!! Overall, you really can't go wrong with this place, the view is killer too."}
{"text":"Josh Mitchel is the greatest bartender in Pgh.  Very friendly.  Prompt and attentive.  Great drinks!"}
{"text":"We started out with having a great evening.  When it can time to leave we were basically shoved out the door by very rude bouncers.  Two actually tried to picked a fight with my husband, very unprofessional!!  That completely ruined our evening and I have desire to go ever go back!!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I love a packed nightclub but this place is just ridiculous! It has three parts (90's, Karaoke, and Country) plus a mechanical bull. This place has lines that wrap all the way around the building, it's stiflingly hot, and it takes FOREVER to get to the bathroom (there is only one bathroom for all three parts of the bar and it's all the way in the back of the place. The dance floors are always super sticky and wet with the occasional glass or bottle on the ground.   If you want to ride the bull you get first preference if you have a wad of cash for the operator or if you are a pretty girl wearing something short. It's definitely not first come first served which I have seen make a TON of people mad.   Many of the bartenders seem to be fresh out of highschool and don't really know what they're doing which gets to be very frustrating for people waiting in line to get to the bar then to be met with people who underpour and often don't even know how to make shots is a major turnoff.   If you're looking for a massive collection of jerky guys and sweatily being hit on, this place would be for you. I only go here if my group drags me because it just really isn't fun."}
{"text":"Terrible service, horrible food!  This place should move over and let a real Restaurant come in. Goodness knows we need a few good Restaurants in Station Square"}
{"text":"This place is gross. It's overcrowded, has rude staff and sticky floors. It also attracts a questionable type of crowd. A sixty year old woman in a tube top tried to fight me - nuff said."}
{"text":"Our Waiter Zach is awesome  Whatever they are paying him it's not enough !!!  They chicken waffles Sooooo good  And beefsteak excellent ."}
{"text":"this place is packed every time we go to the north shore. kept one star open till i try the BBQ still new so the bars are over staffed and drinks easy to come by. the 80/90s room dj plays the crazy shit from back in the day"}
{"text":"The menu was limited. Because of game day events at Heinz field etc. We were not told that till after we were seated.( we were given a full menu at the door)Are server was poor . she was probably the worst server I had in a long time. The place was not that busy. She should of been on top of things. The only good thing I have to say is that what we ordered everyone enjoyed. Im  sure under a different day and server that I would have given a better rating."}
{"text":"Tequila Cowboy has four connected themed rooms that you can visit, all with different music. The main room has a mechanical bull and had live music when I came in. The place was packed at 10pm on a Friday night and it seemed like all the guys were wearing plaid. It's definitely popular. Plenty of people were dancing, taking shots, and having a good time.The concept is interesting, but the execution isn't quite there. Operationally, Tequila Cowboy has a long way to go.   I'm know I'm not the type of clientele that Tequila Cowboy seeks to draw - I much prefer cocktail bars and having a little bit of space. With that said, I end up in the rowdier night life type bar sometimes and this was definitely one of the worst experiences. It was almost impossible to get around between rooms because it was so packed and the lack of clear paths between the kitchen and the bars made it almost impossible for the staff to deliver their food. The flow of traffic could have been designed better for sure and there aren't clear exit signs for when you want to leave.   Also, maybe it's a Pittsburgh thing but I was so disappointed to see so many plastic cups. Even the dive bars I've been to (albeit in Portland) used proper glassware."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food was delicious, great location on the North Shore and nice decor with the American flag on the wall but we were there at 5:00 and they were already out of oranges, Jameson, and premium tequila. I ordered a premium tequila margarita and I watched the bartender put Montezuma Tequila in my drink and didn't even let me know."}
{"text":"If you like terrible country cover bands, people stepping on your feet all night, a 2 mile long wait to use the bathroom, a karaoke room the size of a closet and a $9 plastic cup filled half way with rum & coke, then this is the place for you! Probably the worst bar to come to Pittsburgh. 1 Star is a generous rating. Amateur hour at its finest. I haven't come across one friendly staff member.. even the lady working in the bathroom is rude. Out of the 3 times I've been to this bar, each experience was far worse than the previous one. And to top it all off, they don't even serve Yuengling. Just take my word for it and don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Tonight was their opening night. The bar tender at our hotel also works here and told our group of 15 people to come here. We had a good time and enjoyed visiting this part of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Watch out for the bouncers with bad attitudes. They stink face so hard you'd think they can smell their own farts. Obviously they cannot because they never think they're in the wrong. Even when throwing round house punches at patrons."}
{"text":"We tried to grab a beer on Sunday outside during an unexpected beautiful day in the Burgh. And even though it wasn't crowded the bartenders would not acknowledge us and were very rude. This is about the 3rd time here and it keeps getting worse due to the service and lack of management. I'm sure at night with the concerts and other events they are more properly staffed and equipped to focus more on customer service. However, we were so disappointed on Sunday that we left without getting serviced and went down to Southern Tier. There are too many options on the north shore now to have to put up with bad service."}
{"text":"This place is great as is, but their bartender Josh Mitchel takes it to the top echelon. Fantastic bartender and his presence at TC is unparalleled."}
