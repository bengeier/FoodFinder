{"text":"We really wanted to love this restaurant. And things started well: we were seated at a great table right in the front window, and the server was friendly ... but things could have gone better from there on.  First of all, we were surprised at how sweet (as in lots of sugar) all of the food was - even the naan, and especially the butter chicken sauce.  And Baghara Baingan (\"Baby Eggplant cooked with peanut, Onion, sesame seeds and spices\") came with what we think was a brown-sugar sauce that would have been right at home on an ice cream sundae!  (When we asked about the sugar issue, our server did say that next time we could ask for 'less sweet.')  And we were a bit disappointed at the service - less attentive as the evening progressed.  We waited a bit long for our meal, and getting the bill was like pulling teeth."}
{"text":"I gave this place 5 stars because I really want to encourage people to go.  Hands-down the best tasting Indian food I've had in Toronto (and I'm half-Indian). Freshly-prepared foods using no pre-mixed sauces or ingredients, cooked to your degree of spice tolerance. Comprehensive menu that features many North Indian favorites as well as a few of the chef's personal touches. Daily specials (a novelty for an Indian restaurant) include a few \"fusion items\" like guacamole paneer, which was a paneer sandwich stuffed with guacamole, deep fried in gram flour (pakora-style). No, it's not my grandmother's Indian food at that point, but there's lots of stuff on the menu that she would have enjoyed too! I just like to see Indian chefs innovating!  We enjoyed the above-mentioned paneer and some piping hot shrim (small prawn!) pakoras -- deftly presented with house-made tamarind and chili-mango sauces and a wonderful citrus-cucumber garnish (again, one step above the usual Indian fare). Main consisted of saag lamb -- beautiful pieces of top-quality meat braised to perfection, no stringy fatty bits -- and mixed vegetables which were perfectly seasoned and retained their crispiness rather than cooked down to a pulp in the unfortunate traditional style. We had a wonderful saffron rice and naan stuffed with onion and cilantro (beats Amaya's bread bar hands-down). The only drawback was a slightly sweet and watery raita (yogurt dip).  Decor is a step up from your typical Indian restaurant, although the prices are very reasonable. Interestingly, they have a house martini list that features drinks such as mango-chili martini. Not necessarily for everyone, but another way to try something new, and another thing that distinguishes Mela from other Indian restaurants in Toronto.  Service was very friendly and attentive.   The ONLY drawback is that this place was too quiet. Soft Indian music playing in the background and it's located in a sleepy family neighborhood near Lawrence and Avenue. If you're looking for a night out to party, this is not the place for you. Honestly, I think this place would fare much better downtown. But if you want an excellent, quiet meal in pleasant surroundings, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I was there for dinner last night, and boy was it disappointing!  The butter chicken sauce was runny and bland, the spicy curries were almost bitter, with absolutely no flavour, the garlic naan tasted like garlic powder.  Not a single thing was worth eating, and I love Indian food!  Even the rice pudding, a personal favourite, tasted like absolutely nothing.  Not even sweet.  I would definitely NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really love this indian place! Not to greasy and they offer mild, medium and hot spice options. You also get a good size portion and a giant na'an. Their delivery is also quick and reliable."}
{"text":"Well. I went to Mela around 3:00 one afternoon for lunch because it was another late night / early morning of drinking and of course there was noone inside Mela. However, they actually sat me and served me lunch.   The decor of the restaurant is really clean. Nice clean white walls and lots of white. The waiter was really friendly and didn't have to be reminded for refills.  Anyways, I had the lamb vindaloo with some garlic naan. I got it spicy enough that it was just right for me. The curry was not overwhelming and the naan was very good. I had to order a side dish of rice because that does not come with the meal which kind of sucks.  I think this is one of the better indian restaurants in Toronto and will def. come back."}
{"text":"delicious indian food. service is great, the place is quiet, and a great location. i will keep on coming back"}
{"text":"- Not greasy - lots of flavours (not bland) - garlic naan and garlic rice are delicious - veggie samosas appear to be made fresh using a puff pastry and have some good kick to them.  My favourite is the chicken tikka masala. My girlfriend loves the channa masala.  I love the fact you tell them how spicy you want it.  That's how you know how fresh it's made.  Been here twice, and have done take-out once.  Consistently great! Would definitely be going back."}
