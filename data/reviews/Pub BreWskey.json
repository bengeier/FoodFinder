{"text":"Bonus little place that brews their own beer; I especially loved their sour. Everyone enjoyed their food - all sandwiches. You can sit outside and watch people heading into Old Montreal. Definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Their Baltic Porter is incredible. The fish and chips use cod and the batter for the cod is light and tasty. The cod was tender and moist. The fries were hand cut and cooked just right. My wife loved her flank steak sandwich. Incredible single malt menu though we did forego a single malt in favor of un autre Porter Baltique. We split a brownie dessert -- great taste, amazing sauce, and moist, dark chocolate brownie."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Great atmosphere and good beer.  Love it!!!!!! We stopped in to get out of the heat and were pleasantly surprised.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cozy spot to grab beer and poutine on a rainy day."}
{"text":"I ordered a 1 liter Long Island iced tea ($21) which supposedly has 4.5oz of liquor in it according to their menu. It took a while to get but when I did finally get the drink it was so sour it was difficult to drink and I love sour stuff. Since I was in a hurry, I drank it quickly but knowing my Long Island iced teas I knew this drink wasn't right. Within 10-15 minutes the drink was gone and I guarantee there wasn't even an ounce of alcohol in this. I get buzzed off one mimosa and I had this drink done in a few minutes without any kind of buzz. Secondly, no drink can be that sour with 4.5 ounces of liquor. It tasted like pure lemon juice. I didn't order any food from this place but after being ripped off for $21 I'll never come back. Don't waste your money on drinks here."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this brewery last night! Stopped by on our last night in Montreal (honeymoon) and even left with brewery hoodies. Great service, food, beers (their house oatmeal stout was mind blowing) - were outstanding and vibe was exactly what my wife and I were looking for. Hope to visit again in the summer."}
{"text":"Amazing owner! He is friendly and knowledgeable about beer and...hilarious! So glad we found this place my husband and I will definetly head back next trip!!"}
{"text":"We went to see Randy from See Spot Run do his Wednesday night acoustic- sets. Primo location. Super friendly staff. Unfortunately, we only ate Poutine which was unique and really tasty but we were there to drink. Patio was full, restaurant a little empty on a hot summer night but it's all wood and character and Randy is really good."}
{"text":"Given its touristy location, this bar was a pleasant surprise! We got in during their happy hour and had $2 knocked off each glass of beer. Their housemade Kilogramme IPA was fantastic--just the right amount of citrus to the nose. The bartenders were also very knowledgeable and friendly. Definitely a hidden gem in Old Montreal, and certainly a young microbrewery with exciting brews to look forward to in the future!"}
{"text":"We came here because we saw good reviews about the poutine - we were unfortunately misled here by those reviews.   Ambiance was great, we sat out on the patio, lots to look at. Had a brotherhood brew, which is brewed in house - it was fantastic, nice citrus-y beer, very tasty.   We ordered 2 poutines, one with braised beef, one without. They came out luke-warm, gravy was already congealing when we got them - cheese curds not melted. The fries are not fries, its smashed potatoes, which didn't leave much to the imagination. Gravy was good for the first few bites, nice and strong beer gravy, but gets too salty as it goes on.   Lastly, it was $15.00 for the poutine, $20.00 for the one with braised beef. This was exceedingly expensive for what it was, but also understand that this is a hot tourist area and everything will be expensive.   I'm sure perhaps the other food may be good, but the poutine was not - this is what the review is based on."}
{"text":"Great craft beer, really good service. We didn't eat food but I would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Food was just not good. Service was very poor. Our waiter had no idea about the menu, couldn't answer our questions and was impolite. The food was soggy and not cooked well. Not sure what they're doing in the kitchen but it can't be good."}
{"text":"Super bon choix de bière et super service!  Je n'ai pas gouter la nourriture personnellement mais mes amis me l'ont conseiller.  C'est rare de trouvé un bar sympa et pas trop chère dans le vieux Montréal ..."}
{"text":"Really cool unexpected find in old town Montreal. The bar is downstairs and has a really interesting steampunk feel with great 70s and 80s music. Bartenders are extremely nice and knowledgeable. Beer is a great selection of ~12 local Quebec beers. A bit pricey at $8 for a beer but worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a dreary, rainy day so I could not take advantage of their terrace area. Place is pretty small inside but didn't have a problem getting a seat with my group of friends this night. Just wanted to share a few drinks & chit-chat after dinner. Beer, hard liquor & shots; selection is pretty good & prices are comparable to most other mid-range bars. Loud music is pretty loud, mostly rock tunes so turn up your vocals when speaking to your buddies. They do have a kitchen which serves bar snacks, meals & dessert. Onion rings were large but pretty greasy. Our server was super friendly. Near the Old Port. Parking in the Old Port can be a head-ache for some. I have to check this place again during those warm Montreal summer nights & when the place is rocking."}
{"text":"One of the best pubs I've ever visited! Not only is the staff amazing, but the drink menu is amazing and I've had the very best gin and tonic here....and I've had plenty. I realize it's a basic drink, but they have a local Quebec Gin and different flavors of tonic. But I have to say my favorite part was the music.  You can sit outside upstairs and that is definitely the preference when it is warm, but I prefer the downstairs. A bit of a cave feel, but very cozy.  And you can here the music much better. Plus it is the staffs area and you get to interact with them more. I have not eaten here, but I've seen just about every dish go out and they look and smell delectable! Definitely worth the venture off the beaten path!"}
{"text":"Came here on the strength of the restaurant's 4.5 star rating.   It was more like 3.5 stars.  The staff is nice, the location is away from the bustle at the center of Rue Saint Paul and the vibe is casual.  The beer selection is good, but in the end the fare is pub food and there's nothing special about it or its presentation (i.e. salad was served in a warm, rather than chilled, bowl; the battered fish and chips was left in the fry-o-lator a little too long). Is that being picky? Perhaps. In the end the experience was neither bad (1-2 stars), nor exceptional (4-5 stars). 3 to 3.5 is a reasonable expectation."}
{"text":"I've traveled throughout North America for the past 17 years. This was without debate, the best Shrimp Po' Boy I have ever had! And, I love Louisiana, but I say this with LA included. Absolutely delish! I live in TX and I must say the Jalapeño sauce was the best I've ever had. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The best selection of microbrews found in old town Montreal hands down. Their food was good enough for us to return three times. Get the chicken and waffles. Just do it."}
{"text":"Best beer bar in Montreal.   Always great choices of seasonal brews, good bar food and great service."}
{"text":"Best French Onion soup I have ever had. We went in just for a beer after wandering around old port, and one of the bartenders (who were super friendly and remembered us when we went back a couple days later) was eating the soup for lunch. We took one look and were like....sooooo, we need 2 onion soups and 2 poutine. The poutine was one of the best we had the entire trip as well.  As far as the beers go, New Grounds was the closest thing to a hazy NEIPA we had the entire trip and was delicious. The same goes for the cold brew coffee beer, which tasted like slightly boozy coffee. They told us a pint of it had the same caffeine as 1 and a half nespressos. True or not, it was delicious!  The second time we went back we had the waffle ice cream sandwich. My god. Vanilla ice cream between two liege waffles with caramel drizzled all over it. If/when I go back to Montreal, there is no doubt in my mind I will go out of my way to go back here.  Sadly, their Randall had just broke so we didn't get to try any crazy infused beer concoctions, but that is not a ding, just a thing that didn't happen!  Do yourself a favor and go here.   Their logo is also extremely cool, so we bought some glassware and a hoodie."}
{"text":"What a fantastic pub. Great selection of beer from local microbreweries. They offer flights so you can try a variety or the bar tender was very helpful and picked out some delicious beers to drink. They also featured a very talented acoustic guitar player who took requests and could play about anything that was asked. I didn't try their food but it looked good. I will seek out this place out again on my next trip."}
{"text":"Amazing bar with a great vibe and solid beer selection. The staff is the nicest in the business."}
{"text":"After eating lunch in an awkwardly quiet restaurant, we were looking for a pub to grab some beers where we could not get looks from angry french dudes for talking somewhat audibly in english *le gasp*. Stumbled upon this place! Great beer and cocktail menu, lots of affordable food options (we didn't eat though), and awesome vibes in general! The staff were all super pleasant (and hot). We were glad to have discovered this place! 10/10 will return when I'm in mtl next time."}
{"text":"This place was super tiny but service was excellent and the drinks were great too. They had live music when we went (Wednesday night) and the place was packed with people and good energy!"}
{"text":"What a surprise! Great service right out the gate. The waiter made some great recommendations and their IPAs were great. I had to have poutine on our last night in montreal and it was original and classic at the same time. I definitely recommend to anyone looking for good food, beer and a relaxing location on Saint Paul."}
{"text":"Have you ever gone to a new hair dresser and gotten a haircut and that haircut just happens to be the best haircut you've ever had in your life and you feel like you're Charlie Bucket when he discovered the golden ticket... You have this feeling like everything is perfect and you are truly happy. This is how I felt when I walked into this restaurant. There was old timey New Orleans jazz cover of the Marvin Gay sexual healing song playing in the background, the industrial style decor felt warm and inviting. The mouth watering aromas of fresh made food had me salivating before I had even sat down . I felt like I was meant to walk through that door, and I was home. I was torn between ordering chicken and waffles or the grande taco .... I went with the taco. I asked for hot sauce, and was informed of their house sauce made from homemade candied jalapeños. Holy shit; MIND BLOWN!!!! They had a good selection of specialty beers.  The bartender/server was knowledgable on the beers they had and I told him what I usually drink and he suggested the Lupulus. He was spot on! The prices were very reasonable for Montreal, especially for the old port. And as you can tell by my picture it's American sized portions. The only reason I gave it five stars is because they didn't have an option to do six."}
{"text":"Great service with some quality beer selections. From what I understand, their selection changes from time to time, but the peanut buster was a particularly good stout. The location is tucked away in old Montreal within convenient range of many other things to keep you occupied and to see! Would go again and try more beer!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place great food, beer and very friendly staff. We had Cesar salad and mini burgers both were excellent. We also had the inhouse IPA that they brew and it was also excellent."}
{"text":"Fantastic little gem off the beaten path in the old port of Montreal. There drink menu is quite extensive. Had the blueberry mojito which was exceptional. Wanted something light for lunch, opted for the tomato salad with croutons, quite yummy. Very friendly staff, overall a great experience. I will be telling my friends about this place."}
{"text":"Une belle découverte pour ma part dans le Vieux Montréal. Il s'agit d'un pub \"gastronomique\". Au menu un choix efficace avec une poutine effiloché de boeuf super bonne, des calamars chorizo excellents et différents tartares.  Ambiance typique de pub avec un super choix de bières et leur fameux peering dégustation bière / whisky : excellent ! Lorsque nous étions c'était une stout avec un scotch 10 ans d'ages savoureux.  Notre serveur Mark s'est occupé de nous et a été vraiment super sympathique. Nous étions en gang de boys à gérer !  Un petit bémol l'endroit est en sous sol et relativement petit mais au demeurant fort sympathique. Nous avons opté pour la terrasse qui nous a permis de passer un bon moment malgré le pluie."}
{"text":"Nice pub. Have a good beers. They have their own beers. It's good to those who explore different beers."}
{"text":"Exceptionally fast and friendly service. The nachos are a must. This is the place to be for whisky enthusiasts, as the selection is amazing and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Pub sympa donnant sur la rue st Paul  La bière est brassée sur place  La terrasse est agréable  Repas type brasserie ,rien d'extraordinaire mais les plats sont corrects"}
{"text":"You NEED to try the Grilled Cheese à la Bavette (skirt steak grilled cheese)!!!!!! Also, awesome beers and great service."}
{"text":"Visiting Montreal for the weekend, found this place on Yelp, looking for a nice place for a relaxing dinner with drinks. Pleasantly surprised, not a large venue, very cozy. Great selection on whiskey, and the menu was fairly priced. But our server was a wonderful surprise, extremely pleasant and knowledgable and an absolute delight, Marie-France, if I'm not mistaken. Thanks for the lovely night!"}
{"text":"Belle place dans le vieux port !   La bouffe est très bonne et la bière est excellente ! Nous avons éssayé l'entrée de bavette tranchée et c'était délicieux ! J'ai été grandement surpris !   De plus, le restaurant se trouve dans le marché bonsecours alors cest parfait lors d'une journée à visiter le vieux -port !  Nous allons surement y retourner !"}
{"text":"Bar sympathique avec des prix raisonnables pour un quartier touristique. Le choix en alcools est très correct également. C'est relativement petit et populaire alors il n'y a pas toujours de la place. Bon service et personnel agréable."}
{"text":"This is a solid 5 star stop! Selection of fresh microbrew beers was outstanding and the food and service was also excellent. It will be great when Rue St. Paul opens again with outdoor seating but at least there is ample and even better outdoor seating along the beautiful Rue de la Commune. This is always a must stop when in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great little pub in the old port. Awesome selection of beer and delicious + original menu! The only thing is the place is a little small, and get's very warm. But definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"We came to visit Montreal for the day and stumbled upon BreWskey before we headed to the fireworks. We were starving and we're ready to have a quick bite before the fireworks. We were seated at about 8:15. Server came over, took our orders, brought or drink, great. We sat there for awhile until about 40 minutes has gone by, still no food. I politely asked the server when he thought our food might be up because he had consistently ignored us up until me stopping him. His answer: \"Sorry, I'm just not sure honestly. We're really busy and I'm not sure who came first and who's orders went in first so I can't really give you an estimate.\" Ummm okay?? I understand when a server is busy, but the fact that he literally ignored us for 40 minutes and gave us no updates on our food was ridiculous. Finally got the food about 9:10. My wrap was small and when I asked for hot sauce he seemed irritated. He finally came to the table and was so apologetic. Thanks, but couldn't you have said this 30 minutes ago? Wouldn't waste my money here. Try somewhere else."}
{"text":"The service was slow, inattentive, and they made us feel like it was an inconvenience for us to order (after waiting 20 mins to receive menus, after a 20 min wait for them to clean a table right in front of us). The food was overpriced, and they stretch the starch to cover up the small portions of protein. What a shame -- great location, could offer great service, but they don't even seem to try. Ordered the wings (best of everything we ordered but still underwhelming), poutine, grilled cheese, and chicken and waffles.  We paid 160 for three beers, four orders, and a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Friendly waitress, huge selection of beer including craft beers and their own craft beer.   My husband loved the craft beer he ordered.   He even said he liked it more than his usual Guinness.     We were waiting for our reservation across the street and decided to have a pre dinner snack.   We got the French onion soup with Guinness Cheddar and poutine.   Loved the French onion soup, very hearty and not overly salty.   The poutine was not bad.   They used their own home fries, topped with a French onion ring and plenty of cheese curds.   I love randomly stumbling into small restaurants and pubs because you never know what gem you might uncover.   I'd come here again when I'm back in Old Montreal"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, good food, good beer, the staff now their beers! The price is not too expensive knowing that the place are in a tourist place! I will definitely come back !"}
{"text":"We wanted a place for a drink and some poutine to share while watching the hockey game. It was a good spot with some good craft beers. We shared the beef poutine which was awesome. Very rich though. We just couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Pub Brewsky is a unground basement type bar in the heart of Montreal. They brew their own beer and have a nice varied selection. Me and my friends came for a late lunch after touring some of the hot spots in Montreal.   I ordered a Hopless blonde ale which was a house brewed beer. For food I ordered bacon jerky and the salmon tar tar with smashed potatoes.   The blonde ale was pretty good. The bacon jerky had a nice glaze and it and was flavored really well (hard to mess up bacon though). The tar tar was also really good. The potatoes were kind of average especially for how much they are hyped up on the menu.   Overall a nice spot to grab a bite and a beer in Montreal."}
{"text":"Very nice pub. Great collection of beer . Even the cocktails were really good . My friend told that was my the best mojito she had in a long time . The long island ice tea cocktail was great too!  The ambience is really nice . If  you are sitting on the terrace ... its a great place , very beautiful location to have an evening beer with some friends and hang out .  I would definitely come back to this place . Awesome hospitality as well . The waiters were really nice to us. She suggested us whats best ! And She told if u r too hungry, i wil take the orders for food first cos there is a big gang  waiting on the other side .. so before they get started i wil hav yours done :)  The prices are reasonable  too.!"}
{"text":"My first time in Montreal and I wanted to taste some local brews. This place has awesome reviews on Yelp, so I said \"Why not?\".   Pub BreWskey has an awesome selection of beer for true beer aficionados. I personally did a flight to make sure I tasted all the beers that interested me. The only bad thing about this place was the food. It was good, but not amazing either. The serving sizes were no adequate to say the least. You definitely don't get the bang for your buck. I would definitely come back, but just wouldn't order food.   Pros: Great selection of local and renown beers.  Cons: Serving size was small. Food was okay."}
{"text":"This place really surprised me. I needed to find a safe dinner option for six people with fairly bland appetites. What we found was a gastropub that truly impressed every one of us, a place that really seems to care about  its salads and explains (unobnoxiously) the process by which they produce their house-made salsas. Great meat, beer, and atmosphere, and a cordial, accommodating staff!"}
{"text":"Pretty good beer selection but the food leaves a lot to be desired.    Went there for lunch and sat out on the patio which was nice.  It is well shaded so even on a hot day it is worth sitting outside.  The server we had was very nice and was quick to bring over (and refill) our water without even asking.  I got the Hop-Less Blonde Ale, which was pretty good.  The food was not great.  I got the Antipasto Wrap and a side salad, which was almost $20!  The wrap was tiny and the salad wasn't much better.  There was far too much melted cheese in the wrap which made everything greasy (which is the complete opposite of what I planned on when I ordered the wrap).    I would recommend this place either just for drinks or maybe a snack.  I think it is a little too pricey for lunch/dinner and the food just isn't worth the price.  I would go back but next time I probably wouldn't eat there"}
{"text":"Like most Montrealers we don't often go for casual drinks in the old port. That being said, I have say that Pub BreWskey is a gem in the old port. It would be a personal favourite if it was in my neighbourhood. First off the place is relatively small so has that fun imitate feel, secondly,  they brew their own beer, thirdly the beer and the food is affordable and delicious. We are definitely going to make a point of spending more time at the pub.  I recommend this pub to anyone visiting and also as a great place for locals too."}
{"text":"Get the bacon. You won't regret it! Awesome beer and whiskey selection too. Came here as part of a beer tour, this was the last stop and the best one of he day. It can get a little stuffy downstairs, AC was limited at best."}
{"text":"Awesome beers, awesome service. It's really nice sitting out on the patio on a decent day."}
{"text":"This place is one of the raddest places in the old port.   Super small brewpub with great food, beer, and service.   Great samplers of their beer and visiting brews.   Cool outdoor setting when the weather is not below zero."}
{"text":"Had two of the house beers and both were great.  Small place but great atmosphere.  Servers were very attentive and extremely friendly.  Definitely worth the stop for beer lovers."}
{"text":"Arrived in Montreal late after a long drive and this was the perfect spot.  Between the five of us, we tried all of the home-brewed beverages and were not disappointed.  Food good and staff so friendly.  Treated us well."}
{"text":"Went to Pub Brewskey to try their beers and loved their Kilogramme IPA. It's on the lower level from the road so it's easy to miss, but worth coming in for. I also had the poutine and it was a meal. They use potato pieces instead of fries and the gravy and cheese was plentiful. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is a solid microbrewery to visit. They have quite a few brews on tap and also feature beers from local microbreweries.  I had one flight to taste 4 beers. The one that caught my fancy was the peanut buster. It had a strong initial peanut taste and then mellowed into a well-put together porter. I wish I had tried more brews but I was so full from an earlier dinner that I just could not do it.  We sat at the bar and were lucky enough to stroll in before a Canadiens game started. Once the puck dropped the game was put on a projector, which made the game much easier to watch.  The bartender was a cool dude. He was very patient with me as I took my time to analyze the tap list and pick my 4 beers. Honestly the whole bar has a chill vibe.  The bathroom is a little hard to find if you used the main entrance to get in. The bathroom is actually out the back and down the hallway. It gets a bit dark if you are there after the main hall closes.  All in all I wish I could have spent more time here! I think this place makes my list for when I revisit Montreal."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to hangout, have a good craft beer and spend a wonderful time after a long day of sightseeing. The hostess and bartender are always cheerful and ready to serve you, the ambiance is charming and the music is wonderful. Will comeback next time!"}
{"text":"Because of our love of beer, we stopped in on our latest trip to Montreal.   I liked that they had the outdoor seating and then you can go downstairs for inside seating.  The downstairs has a dark, basement vibe going on but I was feeling it.   They were out of several beers so we decided to pick some random samples to try.  Nothing I tried really blew me away and the sample sizes were pretty small.  Most of the beer was, however, really strong!  I left with a gooooood buzz on.  This may or may not be a good thing depending on your preference.  Also, most breweries have reasonably priced beer, but these were pricey.  I also think the employees were the least friendly out of all of our encounters in Montreal.    We got hungry and ordered the pork belly jerky, which was pretty tasty and the saltiness went perfect with the beer.  Overall this I'd recommend checking this place out, but I'd stick to flavors that you know you will enjoy.  I don't think this is a good brewery to experiment at to try something new."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this spot in Old Montreal, great selection of beers as well as several delicious brewed beers of their own! My bf and I preferred the underground bar as it a very European feel to it. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this new place. Terrasse is amazing. Great selection of craft beer from Quebec. This for sure the best new place to have  a drink in the old port."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Brew was great! Local brews. Our server Mark was fantastic! My husband really love this place we will likely go back for a beer in our short four-day stay here in Montreal. Highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Ducked into Pub BreWskey to get out of the rain. Decided to grab a table and a beer to wait it out. The outside patio is covered but all the tables were full so we went downstairs. As I walked through the door way I was surrounded by a barn wood decor with a bar at the end of the room with a huge liquor display. They had over 25 craft beers on tap and half were local brews. We grabbed a booth, ordered a beer flight. You can order as many or little as you like to customize your flight. We each grab 4 each and split a braised beef poutine. All I can say was I stumbled upon a slice of pub heaven. Quaint place, fantastic pub atmosphere, great craft beer and an exceptional poutine. I mean can you describe a better mid-afternoon break. Next time I'm in Montreal this place is on my list for some evening beers with some great company."}
{"text":"We stumbled over here after a few drinks at The Coldroom as we were looking for a larger selection of food than Coldroom offered.   Pub BreWskey had a nice atmosphere and even though it was starting to enter that quiet part of a Sunday night it neither the service nor quality of food suffered.  We ended up ordering another round of drinks here and about 6 small plates to share and everything was tasted and brought out in a timely manor. I would suggest the jerk beef jerky as well as the nachos and for beer I only tried their coffee beer which was fine but not something I would get again."}
{"text":"This is a very quaint little brew pub that brews their own beers. They have an unreal Porter that has a very nutty taste to it that became my favorite porter after the first sip. As the beer went on, the flavours only became better and better. This beer was so good, I HAD to get a second!   The pub is right in the heart of old city, but in a more quiet area. There are cobblestone roads, plenty of old rock, brick, and stone walls surrounding this outdoor patio.   The server we had was very knowledgeable, quick and friendly. The food also looked phenomenal, but we only had a couple of drinks on the patio since it was a BEAUTIFUL Spring day in Montreal!   I highly recommend this place for someone looking for a great drink with great service."}
{"text":"Great cozy beer and whiskey centered bar in the old port.....fantastic service (Guillome is great behind the bar) had some maple chili glazed bacon jerky and some really great local beers, entire staff is knowledgeable about beers offered and food items.....highly recommended"}
{"text":"How I rate my reviews is based on a few things. Ambiance, food, drink, (options) variety, and service. Pub Brewskey had a neat atmosphere, with great music. The bar countertop was copper, beautiful finish. The pub offered many locally brewed beers. I give this spot 3 stars because the service was terrible (for being at the bar where there was constantly someone walking by). Many times we tried to order waters and a small plate and we were ignored. Nachos weren't anything special anyway. I'd love to come back here but I would probably only order a drink and sit outside."}
{"text":"As it started raining, we ducked into this bar to chill and wait out Mother Nature!  A small patio created us (there is some indoor seating in the basement area) but as it was raining it was of course filled up first.  The covered patio was nice though - we could still people watch!  Their beer list is interesting- from ipas to sours to everything in between!  Order a flight and try a few to see what you like!   There is a small food menu - I ordered one of the snack mixes for something to nibble on - popcorn, cheese curds.  It actually was pretty interesting and great to go with a beer.    Service was pretty friendly- offering recommendations when asked.  Overall a pretty solid choice."}
{"text":"WONDERFUL place! My boyfriend and I went here last night on a whim and I really can't say enough great things about it. Our waiter was amazing, and he really knows his beers. Seven recommended brews later and we were super impressed with each one. We had the summer sausage plate first, which was a delicious snack. Eventually we ordered the chicken and waffles, and let me just say that, as someone who lives in Texas, I did not have very high expectations. But oh wow they were amazing! Seriously, I could've eaten two more orders.   Go here. You won't be disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, amazing beer selection and excellent food. Great value for money, right in the heart of old town Montreal."}
{"text":"Stopped here while in Montreal. They have a bar and a few tables inside. We ended up sitting outside. I ordered a flight of beer and some nachos. The beers were really good. The nachos were just okay."}
{"text":"At first, I had a difficult time locating this place,but I'm very glad that I found it on my second try. Bar is located in the basement with a good amount of tables outside. I've never been to a speakeasy but that's how I envision it to be. Food is amazing, place is cozy, music is great and beer selection is beyond what I can handle. Highly recommend for anyone looking to relax and not worry about place that is too loud."}
{"text":"My new favorite bar in Montreal.  The food is awesome, the staff are awesome, the beers are awesome, the music is awesome.  Always playing a mix of indie/alt rock.  It is REALLY small and fills up fast, though, so be prepared.  If they have it on menu, get the smoked meat poutine.  Also, totally surprising, but their falafels are terrific."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here on the night of the Paris terrorist attacks, which the entire bar was tuned into the TV watching the events unfold.  Although the mood in the bar was obviously pretty serious, the waitress and bartender did a great job of explaining the beers and not let it ruin a good time.  15 different entirely Montreal-specific beers on tap, nothing that can be purchased in Ontario, and cheap Jameson shots on sale.  What's not to love?  I left blackout drunk and enjoyed every minute of it, lol"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in old port ! Basement bar with a outside terrace that has me thinking about the summer already. The decor is very unusual and exciting. It's small in size which adds to the charm. The selection of craft beers are vast and the cocktails and spirits, plentiful . The food is fantastic and way ahead of other pub food in Montreal. The Staff are very friendly and genuinely passionate about the place which is great.  The music is a mix of Classic rock, Motown which works ! So happy we found this bar and can't wait to go back !!"}
{"text":"The beer was really good and the staff was SO friendly and gave us so much information. It's a tiny space so it gets super crowded in winter when the outdoor seating is gone, but the staff work their butts off to handle such a crowd. The food was just ok- we ordered poutine and it had way too much sauce and was kind of soggy mush, so I wouldn't recommend for dinner but definitely for drinks."}
{"text":"JJ and I decided that a drink was in order on a particularly windy and frigid afternoon while we were in the city, and Pub BreWsky was the perfect option since we were already nearby. We quite literally blew down the steps and into the little bar, where we were seated in a cozy corner booth. I ordered an imperial IPA and sipped until the warmth returned to my toes. We loved how intimate the bar was (very easy to people-watch from our little corner) and enjoyed our brews, too.  Getting to the bathroom requires navigating in some maze-like corridors near the brewery itself, it seems like it connects to the underground market--if so, that's pretty convenient for shoppers!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and enjoyed exceptionally good service from Orly, making this a five star all the way pub visit.  The house-made \"Knockout\" porter with 10% ABV was outstanding, hard to believe it's their own beer.  My husband and I shared the smoked meat sandwich on rye with mustard - the meat just falls apart in your mouth.  Crunchy French fries with mayonnaise.. Yum.  They have a huge selection of Whiskeys-- thus earning their nomenclature- I guess it's a mash up of Brews and Whiskeys.  Great unpretentious place below the Marché Bonsecours in Port Vieux."}
{"text":"Our family of 4 walked across town to arrive and be told That we couldn't eat here because of age restriction. Must be 21 To enter. Annoyed. No mention of that anywhere."}
{"text":"Really great addition to Old Montreal for sure! Loved the selection of local beers, the long whiskey list, the incredibly friendly waitress, the patio seating on a quiet section of St Paul. The fish taco I ordered was enormous and fairly tastey, the nacho chips it came with weren't particularly good nor super fresh and the gauc wasn't my favourite flavour either - tasted like mayo or something rather than just fresh chunks of avocado? The crowd was loudly drunken suburbanites screaming along to classic rock, being poured shots by some members of the staff, while our poor waitress tried to smile and negotiate other clients with different interests. No stars off for a bar having drunken clients of course, just mentioning it as a note on the slightly contradictory vibe that seems to be going on here as this sweet new place figures out what it wants to be when it grows up."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for a Bloody Caesar they were really good. Bar has a nice vibe the guys behind the bar were very nice as well. Would go back to try the beer."}
{"text":"Nice to find a spot so close to Pl. Cartier that isn't rammed with tourists, especially if you head downstairs. Nice mix of patrons, great service by a mix of staff at the bar, good selection of beers. Only dinged it a star because we walked past the grill upstairs and the sausages looked very burned...but no biggy, would be nice and cozy in the winter I imagine. Go for a few beers, stayed for a few too many!"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection, the whiskey and Scotch selection is great too. We jad the bacon jerky and the quesadilla pizza both were terrific."}
{"text":"Servers are very friendly and knowledgable about beer- wonderful place!! Setting is in Old Port and the atmosphere is really comfortable and relaxed."}
{"text":"This was a random stop in while in Montreal and it turned out to be one of my favorite places!! We were looking for a spot to grab a drink and snack before dinner and noticed a lot of people dining outside on their \"patio\" (technically the place is underground, so perhaps they were dining \"upstairs\".  We were looking to sit at a bar, so we headed down the stairs expecting to find an emptier space (everyone was looking to dine outside since the weather was good (by Canadian standards)), and we surprised to find a pretty lively crowd downstairs as well.    The bartender was extremely friendly (actually seems most Canadians are) and he made the visit that much better.  A pretty extensive craft beer list and I was shocked to see a Stout/Berliner blend, which I knew I had to try.  Stouts aren't really my thing, and I found this to be a bit too Stout-y for me, but the Berliner sourness was still there, and overall I was pretty impressed by the combo.    We opted to share the Tartare Combo with fries, which was both a Salmon Tartarte and a Beef Tartare.  We took our time trying to decide which was the better of the two, but couldn't decide! Quite a nice dish.    Like I said, the bartender made the place, and if you're looking for the craft-beer, basement hang out kinda vibe, then this is definitely the place for you! Great spot!"}
{"text":"Yay cider!!  A couple of different kinds of cider!!  Patio dining is available at a table or at the bar, and the bar is strategically designed to allow for people watching. We didn't eat here, but the menu had several nice offerings. We just came for cider-and it was delicious. Don't ignore the wait staff! They are chatty and knowledgable, not just about Old Port but also little areas to check out in neighbouring villages. So all-in-all, fun, refreshing, and informative."}
{"text":"Belle place dans le vieux port  que nous avons découvert grâce au Passeport en fût!   La bouffe est bonne pour le prix et la bière est excellente ! Nous avons essayé l'entrée de bavette tranchée et nous n'avons pas été déçus du tout! Les morceaux sont très biens!  De plus, l'endroit se trouve dans le Vieux-Port, au marché Bonsecours!   Je le conseille aux amateurs de bières !!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and staff. Recommended 100% over and over. The chefs/butchers are amazing! Take the time to taste the talent! Love this place!!! Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Despite having a name that sounds like a Milwaukee dive bar, Pub Brewskey is a very cool gastropub on the fringe of Old Montréal. It is a relatively small place, dark and cozy with eye catching steampunk gas pipe lighting fixtures.   The draft beer selection is comprehensive, and the staff are well versed on the subject.   The menu is is not huge but has many interesting items. Everything we ordered was very good. We started with Nachos which were excellent for nachos way north of the border.   The wings were served whole, all three sections, which I love. They were dry rubbed and lightly fried, but still crisp.   I had the duck burger with bacon jam which was fantastic. Other people in my party had the shrimp Po'boy and the lobster roll. They were pleased with both, but agreed that the Po'boy edged out the roll."}
{"text":"Can I rate this place a 10!?!? Because it deserves a 10+!  You really should just skip reading reviews and just head over to Pub BREWskey!  Visiting from California with my partner and he is a total beer guy.   I recommend all of the house brews. We were lucky enough to meet the owner Guillaume(great guy and wonderful place) and brewer on our visit.   It really felt welcome and like a local here and enjoyed the ambience!   Our server Marie-France  was so attentive and friendly! The real kind, not the trying to make a sale kind of friendly. She's the kind of woman you meet and click with right off the bat!    I would recommend that you start with a flight and then order brews from there. You really just try ALL their beers. Food wise the Poutine was delicious, the smoked meat was just tight and the Red Tuna (thon rouge) tostada is another MUST! Great food, ambience and beers. Will certainly oh add this to my list of places to visit whenever I find myself in Montreal again."}
{"text":"Nice little find at the old port of Montreal, BreWskey has an attractive street terrace and underground salon that is kind of tiny, and it has this dive barish ambiance, which is so wonderful to discover in the area. Loved the original lights, one can call them chandeliers made of pipes and the funky bar stools.   The service was super friendly and fast, expected as we were some of the very few customers. Ordered the signature poutine with smashed potatoes and of course the tomato salad. Frankly the poutine was a little bit underwhelming. The salad was nice, the mint was an original addition to it.   What truly won my heart is the beer selection, solid list of local craft brews. The bar has been also well provisioned with quality liquors to keep you warm for the cold months to come. No doubt I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and drink selection. The paper kept sticking to my nachos. Perhaps they could serve the nachos on a plate instead. Rose cidre was amazing."}
{"text":"Been twice, great beer selection......all very local Quebec brewed. Great service day one. Day two, not so attentive but the beer and cider were still quite good. It's worth a stop for a beer or a bite."}
{"text":"It is a nice beer bar on the waterside - you could expect it to be quite touristy, but prices are actually average for drinks (~CAN$8 for a microbrew pint, same for a cocktail). They have a very good selection of local beers, and they do flights. The bartenders can help you make your choice if you hesitate in front of the menu.   Food, however, seems to rate quite bad on a value-for-money scale (all the dishes cost at least CAN$15-20, for like burgers and nachos!) - I would advise against eating there.   They have a nice terrace outside, perfect to enjoy your drinks when it is sunny outside :)"}
{"text":"It was open late for food, the food was good after a long drive, great whiskey prices."}
{"text":"The indoor seating area felt rather small, but my food and the service were top notch. I highly recommend the French onion soup!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this bar in an effort to get away from the crowd. We really did not want to go into a touristy spot, and this bar fit the bill - it was filled with locals.   When we walked in they did not have any seats for 2 people, but rather than make us wait, our waitress sat us in a booth, but did tell us that if a large party came in, they would have to move us. And we were okay with that. Once seated, we reviewed their pretty decent list of beers, and ordered one pint each. The space itself was dark, small and eclectic (it's in a basement btw), and though busy, the noise was tolerable (we did not have to scream to be heard). Half way through our beers we were asked to move to a table for two because a large party had arrived - no problem. Once seated at our new table, we decided to take a bite of a dessert that we had purchased earlier that evening, and our waitress chastised us for it. Yes, very embarrassing. I could think of 5 different ways the situation could have been handled differently and more professionally by the staff over the, \"keep your food in the box and don't eat it here.\"   So...the evening started well with their willingness to accommodate us, and ended badly with them chastising us over taking a bite of our dessert."}
{"text":"Service was great, friendly people, local craft beer is pretty good too. Quite liked the furniture both downstairs and outside. Price ($8 for a pint) is perfectly normal for the area."}
{"text":"Solid place, with a good selection of daily craft beer.  Really intimate because of it's size, and is a nice place to grab a pint."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for QC beer selection, chill/relaxing vibe, and comfort food that kicks ass. It is located down in the Old Port area in the basement level and is perfectly warm/inviting/friendly when it is cold/snowy outside.  If you are in Montreal and the above peaks your interest, stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing Staff & excellent food.  You must enjoy this place if you visit old montreal."}
{"text":"Great drinks and beer with pub food that was pretty good. It was a sunny day when I went so we sat outside at people watched. I gave 4/5 stars because even though our server was friendly service was very slow. Another plus was that the server definitely mentioned my allergies to the cook because they were concerned my original choice would be an issue."}
{"text":"Mec, dude. Best bars in Montreal. Good brew including their own beer. Try a flight and hang outside in their wonderful patio facing the park. Try their Porter with the homemade pork belly jerky. The best.   Amour. Will hang out here every night."}
{"text":"While on a work trip in Montreal I was searching for local breweries/pubs to get my fix, and because of the high rating on Yelp I decided on this spot to be my first stop. I can't say enough about this little whole in the wall... it was exactly what a hidden gem should be.    For 1, it's actually \"hidden\", the entrance to BreWskey is below ground so if it's your first time there be sure to put down the GPS and look for the sign instead. For 2, its small and cozy, max compactly would probably hold 50-60 people, that combined with the lighting and décor makes its one for more intimate feeling pubs I've ever been in. For 3... the beer was delicious. I mean didn't want to order food so I can save room for more beer, delicious. I had a flight of 6 different beers, and I don't know if it was the romance of the environment or the excitement in me but I swear even the IPA was good.    If I ever have the pleasure of visiting Montreal again, this little pub will be the first place on my list."}
{"text":"Love the underground bar. Food is really good, and the beer selection is great. Bartenders, owners and staff are all top notch. Wish them the best, and will definitely stop by next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"yay! first time in montreal, and was looking for a later-night dinner. after calling a few places, and my nyc 24/7 appetite i was beyond frustrated .. the kitchen was open until 130am!!!! SO HAPPY. we trekked over, and it was a cool little downstairs door, felt like the west village or something .. yet foreign. we were greeted with smiles all around and a hipster decor. booths, a bourbon selection, and they even make some of their own beer! (the peanut butter stout? WHOA.) they had a few veggie/vegan options and i was ecstatic, wasnt what i expected but an amazing surprise. the presentation, the flavors, the service .. all A1. thank you a million times over, and will do my best to return in the future."}
{"text":"Somehow in the winter this place seems tucked away, despite being in a huge tourist center. I walked right past it the first time, busy looking at the lights they'd just strung up down the street.  I'm glad I managed to make my way in. The space is cozy and very on-trend. Copper bar, gas pipe everywhere. The beer selection is fantastic, obviously. I tried three of the beers and they were all good. They were big on flavor, so if you're looking for something subtle this might not be the brewery for you.  If you're not sure what you want, the bartender will happily go through the options with you. And if you're into brewing (which most of the folks there when I went were) he'll get into the nitty gritty on that, too. I got to try a beer that's in progress, which was neat.  They have a menu with fancy bar food. I didn't eat, but everyone with food looked happy (and their food looked pretty good).  This must be an entirely different place when the weather is warm, the market is mobbed with tourists, and they have a giant patio."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of Canadian micro brewed beer. Really friendly little spot with a really cool bar and funky details like water pipes turned into lighting fixtures and cozy tables.  Best tasting beer I've had while visiting Montreal this week-and by the I mean very flavorful and fresh. I asked the owner how often they clean the taps...and the lines. after every keg change and I think they were 1/4 kegs I saw, but dunno how they do it up here in the Canada. Anyway-really friendly atmosphere and really yummy and varied beer. I had a Stoudt and a Belgian Saison and a cider...all excellent. In fact I am going back there right now cause they had about 10 other choices I wanna try. If ya like great beer ya gotta go."}
{"text":"We went to Pub BreWskey after attending a Cirque du Soleil show, in part because it was close by, and in part because we have the Passeport en fût.  We started with tasting four of their in-house brews with the Passeport. Great beers. We tasted the RYEdical, a  red ale made with rye, the United Kumquat, a white beer with spices, the Kilogramme, an IPA, and the Maltshake, a milk stout. The Kilogramme was my favourite in the bunch, great taste with the perfect level of bitterness!  We had food as well. I ordered the philly cheese steak and my girlfriend ordered the smoked meat sandwich. Both were excellent, if not a little messy to eat! :-)  Service was great, efficient and great explanation of the beers. They have a good selecton on tap of in-house brews, guest brews and imported bottles as well.  A nice find. Thanks the Passeport for the discovery!"}
{"text":"My wife and I popped into this little gem for a couple beers after the long drive from Boston.  Great local beer selection. The staff was excellent, very welcoming. The snacks are terrific!"}
{"text":"Let's get the good out of the way before getting into this 1 star. Food good, beer? Great.   Ok. Now service. We've never been so insulted at a brewpub. Our tab was $46, with taxes. I threw $5 on for tip. Our waiter, who came by once to get our first order, 2nd to bring food (2 bowls of soup), and 3rd to bring next round, proceeded to tell us that we did not tip enough. Seriously?! This entitled millennial is griping over $1!!! Not to mention this joker was on his phone and drinking beer behind the bar! Just looking at some of the other reviews on here, I'm not surprised with this behaviour! It really is too bad. We sat there tonight really enjoying the beer and said we'd come back tomorrow. Not now!!! We'll give our money and justified tips to other establishments in this city. This was embarrassing and deflated our evening! Perhaps get the hardworking staff in the back to run front of house; the condescending tool you had out front tonight was an elitist twit that will turn away customers!"}
{"text":"What a great, no frills spot! My husband and I were visiting for the weekend with another couple and popped into here. It has this basement feel to it but it totally works. Very knowledgeable staff. You must, I repeat must get the bacon/jerky. Mouth watering."}
{"text":"Great, small, below ground local.  Nice selection of brews."}
{"text":"Dope little bar with outside seating and an underground indoors. We got there at 3 on Friday and by 5 it was packed. Lots of good beer choices, didn't eat the food since I sustain purely off of alcohol. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After walking all over Old Montreal and the Port area, the family was starving.  My brother n'law wanted to try this place so we did.  Was hoping for delicious pub food at Pub BreWskey.  What we got was alright.    First let me start with the positives:  1. Dining outside at the terrace was terrific.  2. Beer was very good.  3. Service was fine.  The food, as I mentioned earlier, was just alright.  Nothing extraordinary about the Hummus, Fish& Chips, or Grilled Cheese with Bacon sandwich.  I had high hopes for the Poutine Brewsky.  Unfortunately, it was bland and underwhelming.  Best thing about it was the onion ring on top.  Would return for the beer, but not for the food."}
