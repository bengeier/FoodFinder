{"text":"Yum! I know, I know....it's in Carolina Place Mall, and that's suspicious. But the sushi is SO WORTH IT. The crispy squid roll is some of the best sushi I've had in Charlotte :) They could probably do with some more seating closer to the counter, but it's a small price to pay for such good food."}
{"text":"I'm a big lover of sushi and I've tried a couple of place around that i can get delivery from and this is the best. I ordered there three time already and I've never been disappointed. I received my meal quickly, and they never got anything wrong and there's plenty of soy sauce and ginger.  Now the sashimi are a nice size and really fresh, same for nigiri. Theirs maki are also fresh and they've got a nice variety of speciality item. The miso soup is good too.  Overall I love this place and I'll order from there again!!"}
{"text":"This is the only place in town I get sushi. They are always friendly and the sushi is always good and fresh. yes, there is probably better sushi around, but when you couple good food together with great service, why go somewhere else? Always a 10! 10! 10!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by how good this place is!!! Literally under an escalator, the sushi is delicious!!"}
{"text":"You can now get your sushi fix at Carolina Place Mall's food court!  I am so glad that Wasabi Sushi took over the former Time Warner Cable and customer service Center behind the elevator.  If I can't exchange out my DVR box, at least I can get some fresh tasting sushi!    WS offers a full menu in a quick stop space.  Grab your sushi and head to the tables in the main food court or take it home like I did during my first visit.  My tempura shrimp roll was fresh from the wok and still warm when I bit into it.    I found my new go at the mall when hunger strikes."}
{"text":"I am a New York snob when it comes to sushi. Although I had found some decent places, I had yet to find \"the\" place. After reading yelp reviews, I decided to give it a try. Holy moly, was I surprised. Sushi is fresh, rice is perfectly seasoned and textured. Absolutely amazing. Actually, as I'm writing this review my husband is picking up our sushi order for our dinner since the mall is so crowded with holiday shoppers. It's been a year since we became regulars, I continue to be grateful I followed the recommendations on yelp :)"}
{"text":"It was my first visit, sometime in the late evening, me and my boyfriend wanted to get take-out. They were not ready to make certain sushi we were ordering from the menu so we were limited to what was already made by the chef: Understandable. Maybe it was near closing time, and remaking certain items may be a hassle (but on the contrary, why are you running a restaurant?) Then, as we are waiting for our take out, I grab two chopsticks from the reception (one for me and one for my boyfriend). The lady bring us our take out in a plastic bag and the moment she sees that I am carrying two chopsticks in my hand, she reaches down to the plastic bag, and removes the two chopsticks she had initially put, then she grabs the chopsticks from my hand, and throws it back into the bag. Really? What if I had friends waiting at home to share the sushi with me? It was two boxes of sushi that could be shared afterall. I had to \"request\" for extra chopsticks after being denied my order from the menu YOU had provided? What harm would have done if she had kept the chopsticks she had initially put in the plastic bag instead of making me feel like chopsticks were a rare commodity. I'm sorry but a little customer service goes a long way in the hospitality business. However, the sushi wasn't bad even though it wasn't the ones of our initial choice. Next time I visit, I'll make sure I visit at a time where you will make the sushi I order and keep in mind how scarce chopsticks are. IF there is a next time."}
{"text":"Okay this is first rate sushi! I love it! Sad but sometimes I find an excuse to go to the mall just so I can get the crunchy shrimp roll! Made to order! Quality is excellent and staff could not be any nicer!!"}
{"text":"Don't pass this place up just because it is in a mall. I work at Carolina Place and often have to grab something from the food court which as you know does not have the healthiest choices. The sushi is fresh and delicious and the staff (owners) are a gracious and extremely hard working couple who go out of their way to make your experience pleasant and the sushi beautiful."}
{"text":"Really folks..it is what you would expect from a food court. Very average sushi not great quality.  I wonder how diverse of sushi experience one would have to rate mall sushi 4 or 5 stars.. For the area this may be the best in town, but if you know good sushi this ain't it."}
{"text":"Tried out Wasabi Sushi based upon Yelp reviews. Wasn't disappointed. I had the New York roll. My wife had the Crazy Tuna roll; daughter had the Spicy Tuna. Really good sushi at a great price. Not often I'd highly rate food in a mall. Don't let the location fool you. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I go for their lunch specials. The choice of three items with 11 sushis each I believe. Nicety as well and decent prices at lunch special time.  Nice people who  work there. - DPG +"}
{"text":"Sushi Amazingness in the middle of the Mall, not a mall of my liking but a MALL (Carolina Place). This sushi is prepared FRESH as you order and the chef is very friendly and personable.  The staff is amazing they remembered our order from our last visit and asked if we wanted that again. I mean how's that for customer service in a high traffic area that service many people daily.  The sushi is amazingly and surprisingly FRESH. The specialty rolls are so good we had #9 and #11 on this past visit as this was our second visit. I waited to review to see how consistent they were with freshness, flavor, customer service, etc..  This place nailed it in all aspects and earned a regular when in the area. I am not a fan of the mall AT ALL but my daughter does work their and I'm usually dropping her off at the food court and pulling off (my hubby and I). Now I have a reason to walk in through the food court and right on over to Wasabi and right back out that door.  This place deserves a standalone restaurant somewhere outside of the mall.  P.S they only loose the star because of the location (Carolina place mall, not a fan of this place)"}
{"text":"LOVE, love, love Wasabi Sushi. It is truly amazing mall sushi. BY NO MEANS IS IT MALL SUSHI. it honesty needs to have its own restaurant. The quality of the food is great and never disappoints, ever. I have never received a bad roll or one that I was in any way disappointed in. The staff is friendly and even remembers my orders from last time. They really are great."}
{"text":"So I've been here to eat a couple of times, and both experiences were generally positive. Service is very prompt and efficient, food is always super fresh and delicious, and there's a good variety of things to choose from. It's a bit expensive in my opinion, but the food is really good so it's worth a small splurge every once in a while!"}
{"text":"Like other reviewers,  we couldn't believe we were eating and ENJOYING sushi from food court?! The prices are very reasonable, average portions and rolls are fresh and tasty.  One complaint would be reduce the amount of cream cheese/mayo. We like th Smokey Bear, Spicy Salmon and California Rolls. Service is decent and you do not have to wait too long for food. This place will not replace Cowfish for us, but Cowfish's wait times places Wasabi as a solid alternative."}
{"text":"Best sushi!! Best service!! Awesome people both very friendly always smiling!! Love it here!!! Taste is amazing and price is soo good for the amount you get better than you would expect!! A must go!"}
{"text":"It's so nice to be able to get decent sushi when shopping in a mall. They're located right across from forever 21 at the beginning of the food court. The prices are reasonable and the sushi was good. I had the crunchy shrimp roll (12 piece). For the price of $9, it was a great meal! Very flavorful and filling! Will go again!"}
{"text":"Any time I go to the mall I always always come to wasabi sushi. Its amazing and I've had many people try their sushi with me and they all loved it as well. The owners are very sweet and really it all tastes amazing. The bubble tea is really good as well and the food definitely beats the food court food."}
{"text":"Love this sushi place! My favorite roll is the Wasabi roll! The owner are super nice and friendly.  My favorite place so far :)"}
{"text":"I eat here often. The food is always great and so is the customer service! You can grab and go, or have a seat and enjoy. Affordable as well!"}
{"text":"When I first saw this was in a mall I was quite skeptical. BUT after reading reviews I decided to give it a try! I was in Pineville for the REI and ventured into the mall. I got a spicy crab roll for $7!!! How can you beat that? And it tastes like something you would find in a restaurant. I would definitely eat here again if in the area. It was super clean and the fish looked fresh."}
{"text":"I love this cute tiny place. The sushi are fresh and delicious! And the owners are hardworking and kind. The bubble tea was okay but still good."}
{"text":"Sushi in the mall? Hmmm....not so appetizing, right? Wrong! I was skeptical at first but I must say this is really good sushi and very fresh. This skeptic was turned into a believer. I'm not a big mall/food court eater but my visits to the mall will soon be increasing just so I can eat at this great restaurant. Staff is helpful as well. Great sushi!"}
{"text":"Once you get past the fact that you're eating sushi in a mall, oh my gosh!! Amazingly fresh sushi! I was very pleasantly surprised and have been here several times. I've had the spicy tuna, crunchy shrimp rolls and a couple others that I can't remember their names (all good and so fresh)...Anyway, give it a try, it's DELISH!"}
{"text":"It's not a restaurant where you can dine in a cosy setting, but they sure make the best sushi I've had in my entire life! If you haven't tried them yet, go ahead and do it! You won't regret!!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem, I cannot tell you how many times I walked by this place and did not realize it. I ordered it off of door dash and was amazed once I got my food to find out it was the kiosk in the mall. I have raved to everyone about it. They do a great job of helping you identify rolls if you're new and they recognize you if you're a returning customer. I don't even enter the food court anymore, just go straight to them."}
{"text":"This sushi place is locatd inside Carolina Place Mall where Time Warner used to be. I love the sushi here. The quality of the sushi is great and the prices too. For 12 piece of sushi it usally beween 6.99 or 7.99. The cruchy roll is really good."}
{"text":"Okay I cannot Believe this place is located in the middle of the mall!!!!! OMG this sushi is Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Super fresh. Super yummy. Friendly. Fast. Wow! So surprising given the setting. This might be my new favorite sushi joint in south Charlotte. I would have taken a pic but we ate it all too fast. Every single bite was superb. Cant' wait to go there again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I just happened to grab a quick bite here with a girlfriend and honestly, I'm glad we stopped by. The sushi was SUPER fresh, the prices were VERY reasonable and everything was very tasty. I would go back in a heart beat!"}
{"text":"Actually, it was my third time. This place IS too good for mall. Good, FRESH, hot or cool sushi!! A MUST for a quick take-out sushi!"}
{"text":"This is not the best sushi in the area. However, for being in a mall, this place is amazing. The prices are very reasonable and about what you would pay for grocery store sushi. They have a menu and the sushi is quickly made to order. Though they do have a few prepackaged sushi, I recommend ordering fresh. This is just the best place I have ever had sushi at that has been in a mall, airport, grocery store, etc. where I have actually enjoyed my food. The presentation is even nice!"}
{"text":"I've tried wasabi both in person at the location and I've ordered from them a few times for delivery. The location is clean and very casual. service is quick but no frills. For delivery they have always been On time. While it is a little pricey, it isn't over the top and the sushi is always fresh and well prepared. They have a lot of choice both the more traditional rolls and some that are a little more outside the box. I haven't had any errors with my orders and haven't been disappointed with any rolls that I've tried. I would recommend this place for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"There is a huge customer service PROBLEM happening at this restaurant, but I decided to overlook this the last time I frequented Wasabi. I should preface this review with the fact that my entire office, which is approximately 300 people, had sworn off ordering from this restaurant about six months ago for this very reason.   I ordered two small meals for my partner and I this evening, and upon discovering after I had picked it up and biked home that it was not the correct order I was asked very abruptly if I was just mistaken and didn't just want to keep what I had gotten. Mistake #1: Don't assume your customers are idiots.   So, I decided to bring back my order to show her exactly what I was missing. After she realized that she put in the wrong order, she added up the difference and insisted I pay the extra $1.50. Which was fine with me and I happily paid the extra.  Mistake #2 Then she removed the wrong rolls from my box and sent me away for the second time with a wrong order.   Bottom line: If this was Tim Horton's a couple mistakes wouldn't matter as much, but for such a consistently expensive, average quality product, I expect more as far as customer service is concerned.   They've lost a customer in my office, my partner, myself, and surely everyone we know."}
{"text":"Got some of theirs Sushis delivered, very nice over the phone and excellent product delivered."}
{"text":"decent sushi. Nothing special. The soya sauce is disappointed. It is too salty."}
{"text":"For sushi in the mall, this spot is really good. Don't expect it to be quick, they make the rolls upon order so it will take some time but it is delicious! It's also a little less expensive than other places."}
{"text":"I've been here so so many times and I keep coming back for more. This is probably my go to sushi place when I have cravings. I always get the California roll and it's ALWAYS delicious and fresh. The wait is probably only 5 or 6 minutes which is definitely worth it. The price is very affordable. The customer service is always super good. I don't really have anything bad to say about them at all. Highly recommend!"}
