{"text":"i really like the intimate atmosphere and the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"You will absolutely live this place!! Great wine, great people and perfect location. Restored Victorian home that creates the sense that you are just hanging with friends enjoying a great glass of wine. The owners have a passion for wine and hospitality and it truly show. Hurry and got to swirl, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went to Swirl with a friend and would defintely be back with my husband. The food was really good. We had the pizza with grapes and sage with a balsamic glaze. and the wine was good and reasonably priced. 
My only gripe was I thought it would have a bigger list of by the glass and the acoustics are not the greatest in the bar. Can not wait til summer and being able to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"This was an ok place. Nice choices but not up to speed...
Very small pour...9$ for an inch and a half in the bottom of a large glass.
Happy hour martini was good...wouldnt have even gotten that since was not informed by wait staff..overheard someone nearby being told by different waiter.
Artichoke dip and bread was great though...
Doubtful about going back."}
{"text":"Food is really good and so is the wine. Exception: \"wine bread\" which we thought would be as fine and delicate as the food but instead came as a giant chunk.
But the service is terrible. Our waitress was indifferent and slow, seemingly untrained. And we had to put up with cigar smoke from the OWNER who was playing bocci in an area right next to the patio. Yuck. Instant headache for me, literally."}
{"text":"I visited Swirl on a Thursday and it was ladies martini night. Our drinks were good and we sat outdoors. The patio area is nice and our waitress was friendly. She came by frequently enough throughout the evening. For my meal, I tried the 'build your own' pizzette. I asked for mine with the roasted garlic sauce, artichokes and arugula. When my meal arrived, the waitress informed me that they had prepared my meal but didn't have any artichokes. It was a little annoying that they wouldn't have told me before bringing it out, but she then asked if I wanted to add something else to it so I asked for tomato. About 30 seconds later, my meal was back, with a few slices of an uncooked tomato on top. I wish they had at least put it back in the oven for a couple minutes but I suppose that would have been too much trouble. When the bill arrived, the waitress made it a point to show me that they removed 50 cents from my bill due to the lack of artichokes. Gee, thanks! Overall I just wasn't impressed with how the meal situation was handled. If I decide to try them again, it'll likely only be for drinks."}
{"text":"After a grueling 12 hr shift that ended at 11pm, a coworker and I were looking for a place to unwind that was open late,  and not a typical bar scene. Seeing on their website that they close at midnight we were excited to make it there in time to have some wine and relax. Arriving at 1115 pm, I noticed about 5 people drinking on the patio and talking to a server. The server noticed me pulling into the parking lot, stood there, and stared at me. I got out of my car and asked politely if they were still open or closing and she responded unapologetically and abruptly \"we are closing\", turned around, and continued to talk to the patrons on the patio. If you're going to advertise times, I suggest sticking to them... And possibly hire employees that have an idea of what good customer service is. Unfortunately we didn't get to try the place out, and not looking to try again in the future."}
{"text":"Great place for ladies night out. My friends and I met here on a Thursday night in late summer. The parking lot was full, there was live music, and deals on the martinis.

We were fortunate to have great weather (warm and not humid) and enjoyed our night on the patio. The live music was on the patio. 

My friends had the chocolate martini and said it was yummy. We also shared a couple of dips, the baked brie and the sun dried tomato, artichoke dip. I enjoyed them both. Neither were too strong in flavor. We had enough to share between the 3 of us that I felt satisfied."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. We ordered an appetizer which came out wrong twice. We then had a visit from a manger who stated he would send us the free appetizer which never came. We were then deliver again the wrong appetizer. The remainder of the service was slow and left little to be desired. When the manager was approached at the end of the evening nothing came of it. 
The food was over priced for the quality
I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"I went there tonight for a wine tasting with friends and I will definitely go back there! Amazing food, great place and nice ambiance thanks to the family and friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"One of my fave neighborhood spots. Food is great, try one of the flatbreads. Good quality ingredients and great homemade sauce. Wine list is extensive and reasonable for drink in or take home. When you go ask for Eric, he's the greatest!"}
{"text":"We really liked this little tucked away place. The food was great and the service very professional. The owner is a fantastic, upbeat, friendly guy. He made us feel like special guests. We were also surprised to see several friends there.  We are going back this Thursday."}
{"text":"It's a converted house, kind of strange looking from the street, looks like you are heading over to someone's place LOL.

Went here with some co-workers prior to heading over to Harvest Kitchen in Solon for dinner.   Nice atmosphere, I am not a big wine person but my co-workers all seemed to really enjoy the wine samplers they offered.   They have quite the selection of both red and white wine by the way.

They really had some good appetizers (small plates), I had the hummus and the hot pretzels and they were delicious.  The pizza someone ordered also looked pretty tasty.   I am vegetarian but even the non-veg small plates looked really good.

Service was excellent, the server came over to us regularly and refilled drinks and checked if we needed anything else.   They also have a nice outdoor section where you can sit (we did take advantage of it, only down side was it was a bit windy and you are really exposed to that).

I recommend checking them out as like a pre-dinner destination to get the party started.   When we were there it wasn't too busy, but I heard this places gets pretty full depending on the day and time.

NOTE: Gentleman - when I was there is was  ALL women besides my party, if I was a single guy I would definitely hit this place up because it seems to be a happening place for the ladies...LOL.   BTW I am married, and love my wife VERY MUCH (in case she is reading this)."}
{"text":"Ok overall. Nice ambiance in a cozy old house. Food is delicious. Menu is limited. Disappointed by the staff lack of wine knowledge. One bartender on a Sat night?  Took forever and I had to explain what Chateauneuf du Pape was. She disappeared for 10 min and returned to say they were out. Not impressed. Happened again with next selection. Owners and guests seem to be posers/wannabe's."}
{"text":"Very cute downtown Solon wine bar. Nice meat & cheese platter, little pizzas and a selection of more substantial fare. Decent French selection from most major wine regions (even if they were 0 for 2 on my Rhone selections...). Clubby, local feel. Outdoor patio is great in season. A rare island of civilization in suburbia!  

**Keith, the new chef, is rockin' it ** with daily specials (Seared Fois Gras over eggs & mushrooms!!), and a serious retooling of the charcuterie platter (smoked salmon, prosciutto, etc.). Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"Went early(5pm) on a Saturday and sat outside with a few friends for a drink a few \"small plates\" before heading to another restaurant for dinner.  The patio is wonderful!   The Sundried Tomato-Artichoke was 6 stars as well as the \"chef's choice\" meat and cheese paddle the wine bread was maybe a 3.  The servers were very friendly and liked to talk about the \"history\" of the place and made sure to have us check out the inside which was very nice and cozy.  The one cocktail we had in the group was very weak and really the only other complaint was the glass of white wine I ordered(while was good and a fair price) I just couldn't help but feel \"jipped\" when it arrived in such a large glass but was only about 1/4 full... but we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"outstanding service, love the chef and what she does. very involved in giving you something wine"}
{"text":"We stopped in after wanting to try it for a while. Beautiful night... if the weather holds sit on the front porch. We had the chicken wings... so different! Smoked and then baked and crusty and delicious. And the stuffed Hungarian peppers?  Yummy. We found they cure their own meat and make the sausage. They have no room for refrigeration, so everything is brought in fresh daily. It's pretty close to the freeway so if you're coming from east or west side it's convenient and worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and loved it each time!  My most recent favorite was a Merlot-ade - a twist on a lemonade.  It was so refreshing, perfect for hanging out on the patio and playing bocce.  I've had a few of the flatbreads, all delish!  The hummus was awesome, the cheese plate is great, but my all time favorite are the OLIVES!!! the chef makes the make delicious marinated olives.  I always take home a few jars when I leave.  The atmosphere is super cozy, and very welcoming and inviting.  Definitely check out Swirl!"}
{"text":"No wine(ing) here, this place was great!  Had the barbecue chicken pizza (loved), the caprese style pizza, plus one more.  All excellent!!  The bread is amazing, I think the crust is the same bread they used for the dip.  I normally don't like pizza crust but it was wonderful, very aromatic and flavorful itself.  The cheese trays had a great variety and the wine recommendation the server gave was perfect.  The service was attentive despite our large group.  The guys enjoyed a game of bocce ball, which I didn't mind since they had those super power heaters on the patio.  Great bourbon selection too!  I am sure Ub40 would approve :D"}
{"text":"We went to swirl with another couple and loved it! I wanted something bubbly, and the server upsold us to a split of Prosecco. It was very good, and the service was outstanding. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"An old house converted into a cozy wine bar.  We sat at the bar for happy hour.  I got a nice moscato and delicious mini chicken pot pie with the most buttery and flaky topping I've ever had.  I sampled my friends' creamy yet fluffy artichoke dip and super spicy but still tasty stuffed peppers.     

This place would have been more appreciated if we didn't have plans afterwards.  It took forever for the food to come out, at least 25 minutes per item which were ordered at different times.  My friend wanted the cobbler dessert but didn't think we would have time seeing how long the food took but the bar tender promised it would be quick because it only needed heated through.  20 minutes later we had to check on it and asked for it to go and ended up being a few minutes late for our after plan."}
{"text":"Short and sweet - a great place for wine (ding) down.  They have expanded the beverage list to include martini's and other good cocktails. The \"red\" pizza is perfect with a red wine or good white. Burgers are just right with a good selection. The menu while limited, covers the hunger factor when drinking a good wine. 

Tell Rich you like his bar!  Nice job at making a great place!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to hug our waitress and chef after we ate here. What an amazing experience, everything was made in house and was so flavorful!
We accidentally ended up here on a date night and now we want to move in next door. Our waitress was honestly the best, friendliest, server we have ever had. I ordered a wine flight which was served in a tower with all the details on a printed out card. Then we had the charcuterie plate and it was one of the most diverse and tasty we have ever had. They even had gluten free crackers for me (the tastiest I've ever had) and separated the regular crackers for my wife on their own plate.
We ended up splitting the seared mahi and it was perfect cooked and so tasty. They even brought it on two plates since they knew we were splitting. Usually you get nasty looks but here they embraced everything. They substituted salad for the cous cous and were incredibly knowledgeable about gluten.
I can't than them enough for a great meal and incredible night out, exactly what we needed!"}
{"text":"The filet tips with Gorgonzola awesome ... Always great Keith is just a terrific chef .. Very very creative ... And the service tonight was great .. Tata is awesome for service  ... She definitely  deserves a raise !!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour! Great prices! Great food!  Friendly and attentive wait staff....what else could one hope for!  Make sure to visit Swirl if you're looking for a great night out!"}
{"text":"The service was really (really) bad, which was a big disappointment. The waiter forgot about our table and it was difficult to get refills on drinks or ketchup after dinner was finally served. They also brought us the wrong appetizer, which wouldn't have been a big deal if the service hadn't been so spotty. The waiter kept apologizing, but still was not able to get things right. We approached the manager, and he blamed the bad service on his \"newest employee.\" To be clear, the newest employee was trying his best, but the other employees were just as bad. The manager told us our first round of drinks would be \"on him\" next time around, but did not give us a coupon or gift card to back up this claim. Do you really think he would believe us if we came back asking for free drinks because of a previous bad experience? The better question is, do you really think we would be coming back to a place where we were treated poorly? Considering the prices, the service should be much better than it is. I'm giving it 2 stars for the food and ambiance. The burger and mushroom flat bread were really delicious. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend spending your time or money here."}
{"text":"Interesting array of light food on the menu. Wonderful selection of reasonably priced wines from around the world. Tuesday evenings at 6 PM wine tastings $10 cheese crackers and appetizers are included. Great way to expose yourself to many types of wines. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful a completely renovated old house read done with mahogany rich dark colors fireplaces very well done! In addition to the regular seating there are leather easy chairs and loveseats to relax in. I highly recommend you give swirl a try. I am betting you will love this place too!"}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations! Had heard so much about the excellent food, wine, and service. The historic structure was welled preserved, quaint, and welcoming.  The chef was eager to talk to us about his specialties.  After hearing about his special plans for this Thursday's St. Patrick's Day, we will be there to celebrate!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a pretentious wine snob hangout, keep looking. If you're looking for a great wine (beer and cocktails too) selection in a comfortable atmosphere paired with an amazing menu, you've found it."}
{"text":"Lovely place, lovely staff and lovely drinks. One star off, unfortunately, for the food and presentation. But absolutely recommend and will be back myself.

Came with hubs on a whim and sat in the patio which was beautiful. Staff was very friendly and made some food suggestions. The red wine flight (three half-glasses) of red was definitely a hit. Not sure if they try to pair your order with the food you are having or if they have a pre-set selection for each flight type but the wines I received were just the type i like and went exceptionally well with my dinner. Hubs got a great dirty martini.

 The food was hit or miss. What was supposed to be a medium-well burger was grilled dead and brown all the way through and arrived alone on a plate with three leaves of wilted lettuce. Not too appetizing. Sauce that was requested on the side was forgotten. Gluten-free crackers that were offered to us instead of bread to go with mussels and sausage were.. wait for it... sweet with nuts and raisins. I ended up eating them with my wine. The crab cakes were absolutely delicious but also arrived with visibly wilted spring mix. So overall the food could use a bit of tlc."}
{"text":"We stopped in on possibly the last beautiful, warm evening of 2017 for appetizers and a glass of wine.  I'll go right to the bottom line; Swirl is excellent. The location is very easy to get to off of 422 and SOM Center Road (go South on SOM, right at Solon Road, Right at Bainbridge Road, and Swirl is on the right). 

We only had appetizers and a glass of wine, but everything was so good.  The appetizers we shared were stuffed hot peppers and smoked baked wings.  Everything made from scratch.  There's not enough room for storage refrigeration to have anything but fresh ingredients brought in daily. 

The building was constructed as a home in the mid 19th Century and the exterior exudes that charm.  The interior is respectful to the time period, but at the same time has a comfortable and contemporary feel. 

We'll be back soon for dinner, and recommend you stop by soon too!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a friend on Friday.  I wanted to love it, but......  The space is nice.  The wines weren't all winners and the food was uninspiring.  I considered the charcuterie plate but was underwhelmed when told that it consisted of salami, mortadella and chicken sausage.   I had the mahi speacial.  The fish was dry and flavorless.  Service was disengaged.  They told us that they are re-doing the menu so maybe the new menu will be better?  With all the other options around not sure I'll check back to see if that improves things."}
{"text":"Nice concept but Small and cramped and really loud when busy. Food is boring, and bland. No life or pizzaz put into it. Presentation sucked. Price compared to portion was way off. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich that looked like I could get at a gas station. 

For being a wine bar, the wine menu actually sucked. The part owner- Rich, was a real dick. He had attitude over my questions. Other part owner was behind the bar getting drunk. Not recommended. Will not return"}
{"text":"Every time I'm here, I must remind myself that the ppl of Cleveland, live here b/c they clearly live in a fantasy world, where they believe, pockets of Cleveland are Manhattan or L.A. I love the ambiance, the wine, food, & live music. But I do get sick of being stared at as if I don't belong. My parents still live in Solon & I grew up in Solon! Perhaps a lot of African American woman don't patronize this establishment. Whatever the reason, it's saddening to see fellow \"neighbors\" behaving so poorly!"}
{"text":"Service sucked. Beautiful afternoon, marvelous company, at Swirl for 1.25 hours was served one beverage each and waitress never returned to our table. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Cool place. Great service. The portion is small but all tasty. Love the seasonal salad and the meatball. The pizza is awesome too."}
{"text":"Cute place which gives it a cozy atmosphere. Nice patio outside which looks beautiful at night with all the lights. Staff was very friendly and seem to enjoy their jobs. The drinks were very good-we stuck with martinis for the night. We have found our date night place!"}
{"text":"We came from Akron to take advantage of the gift card deal from Savvy Cleveland.

This place was a bit hard to find but it was worth every second of trouble.

The Chef is a genius, pure and simple.  The might be the best meal my wife and I have ever eaten.  Everything was expertly prepared, the food was beautiful and tasted incredible.  We tried a wide variety of items on the menu and came away impressed with every single bit of it.

The only negative I can think of is the seating is a little tight, but the charm of the space more than makes up for that.

If you want a fantastic meal at a reasonable price you should definitely check out Swirl."}
{"text":"Went with a large group and had a wonderful time. Staff was friendly and helpful. Food was delicious and plentiful. The wine selection is vast with many great options across different price ranges. And, the bocce court."}
{"text":"Just had lunch Eric took great care of me the chorizo chili was amazing and the Italian classic was great. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent place to have great food and drinks.  The staff is very friendly and provides great service.  The atmosphere is very inviting, this was a house converted into a restaurant.   The menu is excellent."}
{"text":"So, I wanted to like Swirl. It just didn't happen.  It wasn't all bad, but the ambience really sucked. 
It's a little wine bar/restaurant in a house in Solon. You walk in through the bar. It's cute. Very little space to wait for tables though. Good thing our wait (on a Saturday) wasn't long. We were told there was \"one seat left in the house!\" and it was ours (yay!)
It's in the bar area (no big deal), but in a throughway and while the table was small, some genius thought it would be a good idea to hang a fake fire box to jut into what little table space there was (it's about 3 inches deep). It didn't even give off heat (which would have been nice in the bar area). 
So, now we are leaning to the side and have to keep our plates, etc out of that space. There's a LOT of traffic behind my chair and around our table as it's on the way from the kitchen to the rest of the restaurant. Really claustrophobic on a busy night. It's also where the people who need to wait for tables tend to stand. Not a great place for even a tiny table.
The wine flight was good. Only, it comes on this huge tree thing and again, there's a huge box overhanging the table. Sigh!
The manager (or owner maybe...he never came by or anything) seemed to be holding court in the bar area. All the tables and several people at the bar save our table, another couple who were clearly on a date (and seated in between the manager's friends' tables), and a few people on the far side of the bar were having a get together or something. This meant that a lot of 40-60 year old people were working really hard at getting drunk and yelling across the room. The manager saw no problem with this and with the exception of not drinking, he was part of the commotion. I found it terribly rude to the rest of the bar patrons and the 2 non-court tables. When the date couple left, they held that table and moved the party around so they were closer, which only made them louder somehow.  No one asked how our time was going. No one offered to get us a table elsewhere (like out of the party). I did get a comment card for the end, for whatever that's worth. (\"How was your dinner?\" Loud)
The food was good. Our server and runner/busser were also very nice and extremely helpful. The manager berated the busser several times in front of the house. Not cool, sir!
I used the restroom. One of the manager's friends spent about 20 seconds jiggling the locked handle. When she couldn't get in, she pushed the door open. I was washing my hands by this point, but seriously, the door ought to have a proper lock (and people should learn to wait their turn!). 
Overall, the wine and food were good (I wouldn't go just for that though). Our service seemed good. The ambience left a lot to be desired though. Perhaps it's not always the manager's friends' hangout and other nights it's good. Maybe it's the place to go if you're old and want to get drunk. It really was a very uncomfortable dining experience and I probably won't go back. I'd certainly not recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink and enjoyed the experience. On the particular weekday night we came in, we were the only folks here. The atmosphere is very cool and the bartender was truly passionate and knowledgeable about wine. I'd like to check out this place on a weekend!"}
{"text":"Swirl is a sweet spot in Solon. You'll be impressed with the wine list, whether you consider yourself a wine enthusiast or a casual connoisseur. With so few areas left in the Solon area to get a sophisticated small plate and glass of wine, Swirl inevitably has slammed waits during expected high volume times. With little wiggle room at the bar- which is against the main entrance- a crowd can build up near the chilly door. I recommend early Friday nights (5/6pm) and late Saturday nights (9pm+) to get in quickly and not uncomfortably stand in the doorway. You can almost always find parking in the lot behind the building.

They have excellent charcuterie, and its a wonderful place for conversation, a first date, or to catch up with an old friend. They recently added wall-mounted electronic fireplaces, which creates a rustic vibe. You'll be impressed by the ability to get lost in your own conversation over a great cabernet."}
{"text":"What a great concept. Solon has need a wine bar for so long and Swirl does it right. Great service and the food is super. The chef is a fresh out of culinary school and already winning awards. She came out to check that we enjoyed the food. Try the Humus Dip, it was outstanding! We also sampled the Beet Salad and a dish called a Pantanella Salad, both awesome. I liked the atmosphere, very quaint and inviting."}
{"text":"I mostly enjoyed the environment of this place. The food, while not bad by no means, was not that special. Very typical American style happy hour options for food.    My friend and I actually only ordered two different appetizers plus wine. The wine was great! A variety of options, decently priced, and they even had wine flights available. Unfortunately though, they don't make the wine so they really can't take credit for having delicious wine, you get what I mean? 

My server was so friendly, and the house-turned-restaurant is very welcoming. They also seem to have live music for dinner time. Really maybe this place would be a four or five star for dinner meals. But alas! I only went for happy hour."}
{"text":"Nice to see a few decent local options springing up in Solon. The space is cozy and the live music when I was there was a nice bonus. Three stars for the food, which seems like a menu of every wine bar ever (I guess that's OK but not exciting). Atmosphere and reasonable wine prices bump it up to four stars."}
{"text":"Met a friend for wine and appetizer. Had the sun dried tomato and artichoke dip. We both loved it. Charming atmosphere. Great service. If I lived closer (unfortunately I live 35 miles away) I would be there often."}
{"text":"When I first went to this pace the \"A\" Staff was serving, but Today March 12, 2015 the \"B\"staff really F staff was serving.  I entered the place at 6:06 PM sat at the bar and waited.  I saw the server several times as she appeared busy, so I patiently waited.  2 minutes later some guest entered sat down and immediately they were approached sitting at a table and they were immediately given menu's and the server took their drink order, so me being patient waited a little longer another 2 minutes and the server behind the bar gave me a menu that was a bit worn, wrinkled and had a food stain on it said \"this is what we have... happy hour now until 6:30 and left for another 5 minutes.  She returned I was already about to put my coat and hat on and leave and she looked at the already served couple next to me and said can I give you another.  At this time I was pissed, felt neglected and left.  She finally gave me some attention and asked why I was leaving I just replied \"I have get going\" not wanting to say something offensive out of anger, or have the  dilemma of \"should this person who neglected me have a tip\".
The bottom line is I do not know if I will return, no matter how nice the bar/restaurant is, I love myself do not to accept bad service."}
{"text":"I love Swirl!  I work just down the road and this is my favorite location for a happy hour.  The ambiance of the converted old house is fantastic, especially if you can get the coveted comfy seats by the fireplace in the winter.  In the summer, they have a lovely outside patio.

I typically order the tasting of 3 wines which have a fun presentation, and always order the artichoke dip as it is the best!  I could eat the entire dip myself, absolute favorite.  

Service isn't the fastest or the friendliest here, so set your expectations low and you'll be all right."}
{"text":"We had a lovely evening at swirl this past Saturday.  Our waiter was Ryan (I think) and he was super friendly and attentive in the right way, not overbearing but there when we needed him.  There were choices of wine in all price ranges which I liked.  We selected a cheaper bottle and we both enjoyed it, it didn't seem like a super cheap bottle marked up just because they can.  We had the meat and cheese tray - the only complaint was that the runner didn't tell us anything about our selection.  I like to know where we're eating, but we were hungry enough that we dug in and enjoyed everything.  We split a pizzette and requested a bowl of just the pulled pork since we had enough carbs already and Ryan came through and got us a mason jar full!  It wasn't crowded and very comfortable and we throughly enjoyed our night out."}
{"text":"Overall was good, reason for only 3 stars was 1) to get in you have to go through the smokers on the Patio. 2) the \"band\" is too loud for that venue, they were also not good.
Wine selection was great, great idea for serving the wine flights (tiered wine holders with a wine description list). Cheese and Charcuterie were very good."}
{"text":"I have been trying to get to Swirl for months and finally made it there a few weeks ago. it's a very quaint space with a few tables in one area and a few tables on the other side of the wall. I sat at the bar which is literally right when you walk in the door. For a small wine bar it works. It smells amazing when you walk in and sitting at the bar, you see all the amazing looking food coming out of the kitchen. 

 I will definitely be back. Had the Forestry Pizza and paired it with Kentucky Bourbon Ale per Dino's recommendation (did not wine wine or a mixed drink). Everything was good. Some of the salads looked awesome and there were a few boards that I would be interested in trying."}
{"text":"Ah, how wonderful it is to have a classy wine bar nearby my office.  Swirl is an upscale, relaxed joint that has the coziest of ambiance.  The building itself looks like it used to be residential, which lends to cozy and chill vibe of the place.  When sipping on wine here, you get the feeling of being in a really cool friends house - especially if sitting by the fireplace (who doesn't love a good fireplace?? It's a natural impetus to stroke one's beard in deep intellectual contemplation around). 
      Beyond the awesome atmosphere, the goods here were, well - really good.  They had a comprehensive wine list with some Oregon Pinot (in my opinion, the best Pinot comes from OR, hands down) and my coworkers all loved their Rieslings as well.  The appetizers at Swirl were similarly delicious, solid hummus and flavorful and indulgent cheese made this joint a hit for me. 
      If you're looking for a classy place to have a work meeting or just to chill with some friends before a film or show, Swirl will definitely put you in the right mood."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and vibe also a good happy hour and you can't beat that. Martinis and one red and one white wine included on the happy hour menu. There is a flat bread of the day on the happy hour menu that day was a vegetable one which was good but would like to try one with meet the next time. Also on the happy hour menu was a sundried tomato spinich artichoke dip with hommeade pita bread which was tasty. I did not try the entrees but thought they looked reasonably priced. Bartender was very personable and seemed to enjoy her job. I would like to return and try the entrees."}
{"text":"Just okay. My company hosted a 'dinner' here last week. I liked the bocce ball court, but it didn't seem to be very well maintained. It would be nice if they had a second one so you didn't have to wait so long to play. I put the bunny ears around the word dinner because we were served a buffet style salad and pasta (with no protein). I guess everything tasted okay, but I certainly wouldn't call that a dinner. I think this is more of small plates and wine type of place. Just know that going in and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Great flight of wine, excellent service and good ambiance.  Fish tacos were excellent.  Will be back the next time I am in Cleveland area..."}
{"text":"Such a great wine bar!  Extensive list, happy hour, daily specials, etc.  I had the soft pretzel which is seasoned with very finely ground salt (makes a huge difference) and I had the amazing veggie burger!
Amazing atmosphere - it's what I look forward to when I'm in Solon!"}
{"text":"My co-workers and I met here for Happy Hour on Friday and let me tell YOU- we are so glad we did. Their wine list was really fantastic. I don't need hundreds of options for glasses, which I feel is overwhelming at other places. At Swirl, they had a good selection of wines and I wanted to try so many of them! I couldn't create my own flight, which was a bummer, but their pre-selected flights are really well thought out. My Bordeaux was rich and exactly as described.

We each ordered an appetizer to share- we must have looked like a pack of hungry dogs because we inhaled that food. Soft pretzels, cheese plate, chicken wings and the award winning Spinach Artichoke dip. Everything was delicious, even the Spinach Artichoke dip, which we mocked for being award winning. Joke was on us- it was seriously amazing. 

The place was super crowded, but in a fun, after-work-vibe kind of way. Service was great- it looked like the staff really worked as a team to clear tables and deliver food while it was hot. Everyone was really friendly and helpful. Geez, I almost forgot to mention how adorable the place was! We loved the décor and over atmosphere.

I really enjoyed our night at Swirl, but the bill was a little out of my comfort zone. This would be a treat or a nice date night. I can't afford to get sloshed here again  ;-)
This is aside from the fact that I'm too embarrassed to go back, as my friends wrote my name and number on the table for our waiter! Sorry, Alan...."}
{"text":"We were out in the area for some shopping and noticed this wine bar's patio.  It was a wonderful unplanned stop.  The food was great - hummus, cheese plate and pizza were all super delicious.  The hummus may be the best I've had.  The service was great, as well.

The wine list was nice with reasonably priced reds and whites (about 8-10 of each) with lots of variety.  When we each decided we wanted something different for our second glass, the waitress suggested something similar to our first glass that we might like - I especially appreciated that.  

Definitely worth checking out if you are in the Solon area - especially on a nice spring or summer day!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been searching for a great quiet spot next to a fire, with a glass of wine. Swirl has met our need. 
Appetizers were good except for the wings. (Dip was the best)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice place to eat and we found Swirl! It was perfect as they were celebrating their anniversary (6 or 7th year in business) and they had a 2 people singing who were really in to the music. It was nice to hear live music, lively crowd and good food. We had the veg pizza which was good. The meatball was tasty but small for the price. Olives were fine but nothing special. Was hoping for something stuffed and wished we had more. We were told everything was done in house so that's nice to know it's all homemade. Can't remember what else we ordered but The atmosphere was warm and inviting. The owners were there happy and enjoying the celebration. They invited us to dance to the live music and we did! What an unexpected fun evening!"}
{"text":"Nice place for a girls night out. Expanded food menu includes a few dinners. Stayed with the small plates. Bruschetta, pizza, sliders, salad. All simple and good. Nice wine/beer selection. I had a Kentucky Bourbon Ale. Gets noisy as the room fills up."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Swirl and I would go back.  My SO and I went for date night on a Thursday, about 8pm.  We almost passed the driveway because it appears they share it with the funeral home next door.  The bartender greeted us when we entered and told us to sit where we liked. Not knowing the layout of the rest of the dining area, we picked a couple seats at the bar.  When asked what we wanted to drink, I inquired about the Italian flight. The answer given to me was \"it's exactly what it says on the menu.\"  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't said with attitude. But I was more asking for details as I'm not super knowledgeable about wine and the menu isn't descriptive.  I ended up with the white wine flight and the presentation is awesome!  It's almost a wine cadelabra.  I enjoyed 2 of the 3 wines and was overall happy with the flight.  We ordered dry rub wings and the meat and cheese board.  I thought they were both fantastic. My other half (who is chronically unimpressed lol) just thought they were ok.  Though he polished off quite a bit of both.  There were a few other people at the bar, one ordered mac and cheese with chicken while her companion ordered a burger.  Both looked really good. 
There weren't a ton of people there.  Just a few older guys getting toasty and some couples coming and going.  I thought service at the bar was fine and the waitresses for the rest of the floor were always seen in motion.  It's a cute place and, I think, worth a return visit."}
{"text":"From my wife in an email sent to this establishment:

I am writing to inform you of the appalling service my mother and I received last night.
Let me begin by saying, I have never been more offended in my life. I left your restaurant nearly in tears.
My mother and I arrived on Saturday December 20th at around 5:30. When we arrived, there was only 1 other table occupied. As the evening progressed, the entire dining area was full with the exception of 1 table. This 1 table was set and waiting for guests. 
Our waitress then came to us and said \" I really hate to do this but could you please take your drinks and move to the couch. We have an important guest coming and she gets crazy if her tables are not ready.\"
At this point we had yet to receive our check and were not done with dining. We had planned on having another drink as this was a birthday celebration for my mother and she was enjoying the experience so much, we were not ready to leave.
We then sat and stared at each other in disbelief. We could not believe it. I expressed my displeasure with our waitress. She was visibly uncomfortable and I find it disgusting that a manager sent her to do their dirty work and put her in that position.
Then walks in a woman who clearly thought she was royalty and your staff began racing around and pulling out chairs and taking their coats etc..
The woman then looked over at my mother and I and gave a sneer that let us know we were clearly a problem for her.
As soon as they sat down drinks and food were immediately placed in front of them and they were even asked if the temperature of the room was ok for them.
I do not know who this woman was, nor do I care.
But, my money was just as good as hers.
After leaving, i called my husband to tell him of the incident. He became furious and called and spoke with someone in charge. He was given numerous bs excuses and was told a 25 dollar gift certificate was waiting for us. That gift certificate will remain there. I will never be a patron at this establishment.
The gift certificate was only another slap in the face.
I would prefer for my bill to be refunded.
I have never been so appalled by a business.
My mothers birthday was ruined.

UPDATE

48 hours and 2 emails later and Swirl Wine Bar in Solon has yet to address the garbage they pulled this past weekend. 
So, if you want craptacular service and made to feel like a p.o.s. by all means visit this establishment!"}
