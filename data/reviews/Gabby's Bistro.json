{"text":"went there with frds! Enjoy the draft and the wings! we watched NBA there . Bartender is pretty and nice to switch the channel for us ."}
{"text":"The food is always good as well as the service! Except one time I went it took the waitress 15 minutes to serve us. Too busy flirting with people at the bar. I guess she doesn't like tips."}
{"text":"Great for a local watering hole but the fish and chips I had was the worst. The staff is friendly and if you live in the neighbourhood just looking for drinks then I would recommend it. So eat before you go but I did hear their wings were decent....."}
{"text":"Good, quick service and affordable well-portioned food. Came here for drinks with a couple of friends (wings and fries are basically a given anywhere I go now), and left knowing more people than I came with. Although it's quite dark inside, the booths are comfortable as is the bar."}
{"text":"My neighbor hood pub, I am giving 4 star cause they are consistent, great service and waitresses for a small pub for fast pub food like the wings."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times as my friend lives down the street and its the only sort of non-fast-food joint that's walkable. My friend seems to like it so we tend to get take out from there regularly. Note about this review: I've never eaten in, so I can't really comment on service at this joint aside from my limited interaction with the bartender upon picking up food (which has always been pleasant).  This particular Gabby's is rather small - I can see how it would fill up with maybe 30 people and be very crowded. As such, I can see why they wouldn't employ a huge staff. There are only three or four booths on one side, a few tables at the front and then the bar area (that I could see).   I've tried a few things off their menu - the caesar wrap is my usual go-to item, its been good more often than not. It's nothing special though, its a caesar wrap. I've also had the buffalo chicken wrap and that wasn't very good at all. It didn't really seem to make sense for a buffalo chicken wrap. I can't put my finger on it but normally a wrap is cohesive, has good flavor and this one just wasn't. I actually pulled the chicken out of the wrap and ate it separately. The chicken fingers are just that, chicken fingers, nothing to write home about. The best part? Sweet potato fries! They do these fries quite well and when they remember to put the chipotle mayo in your container, its even better. I've shared one of the platters before and they're chock full of deep fried goodness but again, nothing out of the ordinary and nothing overly special. Most of what I've eaten has been executed well (considering the simplicity of the menu) and it satisfies the craving for pub fare.  I keep flitting between a 2 and a 3 on this place; I ended up going with a 3 because while its not the very best or even one of the best pubs I've been to, its got decent food, meals are ready quickly and the menu has quite a bit to choose from. It's predictable pub food but Gabby's isn't trying to be something its not, which I do appreciate."}
{"text":"2.5 stars I came here on the fateful day of February 28th, to watch Canada vs. USA Olympic hockey medal match. Granted that the main reason of choosing this pub was impossible parking in other parts of the city, we all came into Gabby's with open hearts and empty stomachs. First impressions were good as the waitress/bartender was very nice and the menu had quite a bit to choose from. But almost everything went downhill from there: -they were severely understaffed for maybe the most important day of the year! The waitress had to be chased down every single time! -there was at least one hanging light or object (in one case a turkey) blocking every TV. What's the point of having TVs if you can't see half of the screen? -With the exception of the burger, the portions were very small for bar food!  -Some seriously watered down Moosehead! -The staff got annoyed at our cheering and began giving us looks. I mean COME ON! -No \"free shots for every gold medal\" were received!   Overall, I have been to better bars (thank god) but I have also been to worse! On the bright side the ~$2 mug of domestic is a good deal (Sundays only!). The mushroom Swiss burger was also tasty (though I'm pretty sure that was goat cheese!) and the food was generally fresh and healthy by pub standards!"}
