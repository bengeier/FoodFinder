{"text":"River Star Restaurant is HK style cafe.  Emphasis is placed on the omission of MSG from their dishes. I did not bring my friend Belzebub to ascertain that fact as he has slight reactions to MSG in food. The service here is decent & there is free wi-fi access.  I ordered oxtail in tomato sauce with a side of rice & something of a sauteed chicken flank, again with a side of rice. I must say I am pleased with the ox tail as it was loaded with flavor & the flesh sloughed off with ease to facilitate my eating. The sauteed chicken was also tender & was lightly coated in something of a honey & sweet & sour mix with a bit of pepper in it.  Overall I was pleased with my meal & would return if I was peckish & in the vicinity."}
{"text":"If you have one of those $10 for $20 coupon from Team Buy for Wagjag, you cannot use it for their specials and you don't get drink with set meal.    We ordered 3 set meals, and we showed our coupon at ordering time, the waiter did not mention any restriction about the coupon. When come to paying our bill, we were told to pay extra $9 for the drinks because when  using coupon drinks are excluded.  They wanted us to pay $9 extra or use the coupon next time.  I said no way I am paying for you mistake.   We walked out without paying a tip."}
{"text":"River Star Restaurant is another newly opened up Hong Kong Style cafe restaurant in the Richmond Hill area.  They do have a new website which is quite unusual for this type of restaurant. They emphazies that they don't use any MSG and all the ingredients are fresh/healthy (less salt/oil) and customer service is their priority (that is unusual fo sure! :P)  There are special menus for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner and all day specials. Prices are compatible to other places and same with the varieties.  Fish Fillet and Vermicelli in Fish Broth served with a drink ($7.99) is quite good. I cannot comment if there is MSG added because I kind of used to that and it does not affect me too much.    The service here is nice and friendly. Free WIFI access.. but I don't think you can hang around too long when the place is busy. Oh and Karaoke on weekends but you going to sing in front of everyone!  I will come back and try out other items in the menu for sure.  They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Interac."}
{"text":"We went there last Sunday for lunch.  The food tasted good and I liked the claim  about no MSF.  So far so good until .... we got home and all felt extremely sleepy.  It was a general weak/fatigue feeling.  It was not food poisoning and no one threw up or made a run to the bathroom.  It was as if we were under \"influence\".  I slept twice.  My mom could not manage to eat even around dinner time.  My BF dozed off on the couch.  I did not get better until after I had my dinner (mainly protein).    It was strange, and the only common denominator among all parties was that one lunch.  I am not sure if it is due to \"MSG\" or other things in the food.   I just know that I won't go back."}
