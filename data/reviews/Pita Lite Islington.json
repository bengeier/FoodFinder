{"text":"Food is always great! Always Fresh! Owners are super nice and know their customers. Their prices are great, plus they don't charge for toppings unlike other places... Best shawarma place in town id say! Plus they have an avengers poster right on their wall which is pretty awesome!!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic and the toppings are great! Staff is super nice. Love the place because their food is supper fresh. I've had their chicken shawarma with all the fixings. Awesome and highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"Wow I cant believe people rated this place a 5.  Been here twice and I will never go back! First time I order the shawarma salad and it looked decent.  Although I didn't like the fact that my meat was placed on top of the salad and the sauce poured all over my salad.  It was a sloppy mess as there is also salad dressing.  So my second visit I asked for the meat on the side...and I received a hard time!  I was told I have to pay for the box.  I also ordered the chicken kabob and when I got home and opened the box...all I can say is WTF.  There was six tiny pieces of chicken...not even enough to fill up a 8 year old boy.  And the shawarma looked better until I realized they placed it on top of a bed of lettuce in the side container. I paid about 20 bucks for a few tiny bites of meat.  What a waste if money.  The salad and toppings may be relatively fresh but the portion is just ridiculous!!!  Overall it was a horrible experience and I will never go back."}
{"text":"I really love this place! My diet can be pretty strict sometimes and the workers help me out with omitting stuff or giving me extra salad. The food quality is always amazing, I've never had a bad experience here! So yummy!"}
{"text":"I've had better shawarma at other places. The quality of the food isn't that great either especially compared to many other plates I've tried. This is the closest location to me but I would rather drive a bit further to get a better quality shawarma plate."}
