{"text":"Only place I go to for corn dogs. Grab the sampler platter. It's great for the whole family. Funnel fries is beast! Lemonade is always yummy"}
{"text":"Love it!!  Really great corn dogs and the Cheese on a stick tastes just like a grilled cheese sandwich!! Yum!!

Great little lunch place!!"}
{"text":"Great experience 
Not only did me and my wife received 
friendly and fast service and during the whole visit the staff kept checking up on us and even took care of the trash , not many paces do that anymore"}
{"text":"Long ago I liked Hot Dog on A Stick because I could get plain lemonade with zero sugar and I could add my own.  Plain, simple and old fashioned...where I control the sweetness.  They used an old fashioned lemon press poured into a cup with water.  Haven't been there in years, and was at the mall shopping, placed the order and the girl at counter says they don't squeeze fresh juice.  I replied they used to.  She proceeds to get a plastic container out of a small fridge and pours me a cup.  She charges over $3 and I'm thinking they keep fresh lemon juice in fridge, and just no longer squeeze in front of you... and thats what she's pouring.  I take one sip and it tasted like crap!  Asked girl what was in it and she said Splenda.  I said I did not ask for diet, or artificially flavored lemonade. I asked for plain lemonade with no sugar which is also called fresh lemon juice with water.  She says they don't have fresh lemon juice.   And then she remarks that \"everything is all technical\"!   WHAT????   Girl is not the brightest crayon in the box!    Was very disgusted with HDOAS at that point and did not feel like arguing for a refund.  After asking my friend if she wanted it and walking away threw the damn cup of lemon artificially flavored crap in the trash.  After the awful experience with the clueless counter girl I am no longer a fan of HDOAS.  Really deserves negative stars instead of one star.  Thumbs down for Hot Dog on a Stick, and clueless counter girl!!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I had to deal with the most bitchy employee at hot dog on a stick shannah I think it was do not go here when this women is working."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! I visited this location and ordered a couple cheese dogs. The gal working was very nice and had me spin their coupon wheel. The food was very good too! No complaints!"}
{"text":"I usually like Hot Dog on A Stick but in this case I witnessed the cashier count money with her bare hands then touch my food.  Are there any food safety standards?"}
{"text":"Still a classic for lemonade...and if you're going to get junk food it may as well be cooked to order.  $11.99 for 4 sticks, 2 fries, and 2 regular sized lemonades."}
{"text":"There was an employee I saw digging in her nose for at least two minutes and then took someone order. She was also sweeping and cleaning things off and never once washed her hands when I asked her if she handles food with dirty hands regularly she told me to f-off and she was the manager she could do as she pleased. She then refused to give me the number of her superior. I was with my girlfriend who is Mexican and the employee called her a boarder hopping wetback beaner. She then told me she had a friend who was a cop and loves to shoot anyone who isn't white. I can't believe that hot dog on a stick employs people with these views and outlook on life. The employee named BAILEY is a full blown racist and definitely bipolar. As long as Bailey is still employed this establishment I will not eat there and tell everyone I know and don't know that they shouldn't eat there either."}
{"text":"Better service than the one in the mall. Fast, friendly service. Same good stuff.....on a stick. Did I mention this location is NOT in a mall. Pepper jack on a stick is the best thing there, by the way."}
{"text":"Big fan of Hot Dog on a Stick the reason I went to this location was so I didn't have to get off since they have a drive thru well...... It was blocked it seemed as if they where doing some fixtures. I decided to go in, the inside looks empty as if they just moved in that day the register is right next to the kitchen which is wide opened there where 2 girls working both at the register and in the kitchen I noticed the girl take the order's grab money and go straight to the kitchen to make the food without washing her hands the place wasn't dirty but it wasn't to clean either when they gave me my food I seen one of the girls pouring the flour in a container on the floor not to sanitary! When I went to get my food the girl forgot my drinks mind 1 of the main reasons to go there is for the lemonade the food was good but I'll just keep going to the mall while this place steps it's game up."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh best service in Vegas!! Tiffany and Ricky were a blast! Best salespeople in town. Cheap comfort food. Got to spin the wheel for spending over $10 bucks, won free funnel sticks. They up sold us into their awesome chill because of all these samples while we were waiting. Seriously blown away by their awesome service."}
{"text":"I love the corn dogs at Hot Dog on a Stick!  Always fresh and hot.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Not having to go to a mall to satisfy my corn dog craving is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Destiny and Seth are great. Great customer service. Quickly made the food with a fun sense of humor, too!"}
{"text":"No gloves! Talked to the manager and he said corporate doesn't require gloves. I thought that was a law. Gross and so unsanitary!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience at this HotDog On A Stick. This guy named Dylan was super friendly and was kind enough to give my sister and I a sample of the blueberry lemonade because we weren't to sure if we would like it and we felt bad for him because the lady in front of us was crazy and getting out of her car causing a scene talking about how she's been their for 30 minutes even though she pulled into the drive thru when we did and we were only waiting less than 10 minutes. Dylan was kind enough to tell us the difference between some of the Hotdogs and was an overall friendly person. Besides from the lady that was really rude to Dylan. He was still able to pick him self up and pass on kindness to us."}
{"text":"The hot dog 'hops' at this place are super cute. They wear the funny dome shape hats that look like circus tops.

Hot dogs served traditional or corny dogs and fresh squeezed lemon-aid.  They use Heinz yellow mustard, which is my favorite, and a great compliment to a really good hot dog."}
{"text":"I went in the other day to get a lemonade and some cheese on a stick and I was met with great service even better than the mall!! The guy who was working his name was Anthony he was working by himself but he was amazing he brought me a sample of their chili(amazing!!) and he convinced me to buy one of their combo 2s the new mozzarella cheese is amazing and I'll definitely be coming back to this location!!"}
{"text":"Love the drive thru!! Everything was fresh. Did I mention I love the drive thru? The employees are very courteous and friendly. The sample of mozzarella stick was delicious!"}
{"text":"I have not been to HDoaS in YEARS! Mainly because I'm never in the Mall. 

I was at The Galleria getting something fixed at Ben Bridge and I noticed that HDoaS was in my 2011 Entertainment Book. It was around dinner time and I was getting hungry. I pulled out my coupon and thought, why not! Coupon was Buy One Get One menu item free. 

I ordered a lemonade, one hot dog on a stick and french fries. 

The lemonade: Yuuuuuuumy. A mall staple from back in my mall rat days :) I forgot how good this stuff was! 

The hot dog: Moist and crispy breading, perfectly cooked, decent quality dog. Not too shabby, just like I remember. 

The fries: crispy, thin, perfectly cooked and salted. Again, just like I remember. 

I gave HDoaS four stars for their quality, consistency and that dang good lemonade. There is something to be said about a product that comes out equally good on each visit, no matter how often or how far apart your visits are."}
{"text":"We stopped by here twice during our recent visit to Vegas.  Ordered turkey dogs on sticks the first visit which were good and lemonade on the second visit which was not good.  It was bland, I'm assuming because it must have been watered down from the ice melting in the display.  I actually worked at a Hot Dog on a Stick location in Texas as my 1st job over 15 years ago.  I remember making the lemonade and it was soo good back then, not at all like it tasted at this location.  Lastly, there was one other customer in front of me in line and we both had to wait a little while before an employee even appeared at the register to help us.  I thought that was strange. Also, the menu board listed light lemonade, but the employee told me they didn't have it.  Again, thought that was strange.  Doubt we will be back on our next visit."}
{"text":"They only got 3 stars because the food is good but why are you selling gift cards if they can't be used. I've called corporate nobody returns calls or anything."}
{"text":"I love corn dogs! Pay no attention to the mesmerizing colors of the their uniforms and to that really funny hat. You could say that I am indeed a Hot Dog on a Stick fan. For some reason they have the best corn dogs I have ever tasted and the dogs are always cooked to perfection. The fresh lemonade here is excellent. Try the cheese on a stick, I know it sounds disturbingly unhealthy and gross but in a non cardiologist point of view, I find myself actually liking this deep fried concoction. The french fries here at the Boulevard mall is the best out of all the locations in Las Vegas. 

If you like corn dogs and lemonade, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Ate here on June 3, 2013

Individual corn dog is $3.75 each. Fries where good, not busy so got my food real hot."}
{"text":"Always a favorite when I go to the malls! It hits the spot and you can't go wrong! Best corn dog you'll have!"}
{"text":"Take your favorite Hot Dog On A Stick, and remove the following:

- Rude teenage mallrats, especially the ones who sag skinny jeans (one way or the other, NOT BOTH)
- Survey takers.
- Muzak.
- Drunk mall Santas (observation valid Nov-Dec only. Void where prohibited.)
- Hipsters going in and out of Urban Outfitters.
- Mall cops with an exaggerated sense of self-importance.
- The temptation of Foot Locker and Champs (sneakerheads, you know what I mean)
- The temptation of GameStop (gamers, you know what I mean)
- The temptation of CinnaBon (humans, you know what I mean)

And retain the following:
- Hot dogs on sticks.
- Lemonade
- The doofy hat.

That alone warrants 4 stars. Warning: they didn't drop the mall prices, though, so have some coupons handy."}
{"text":"The boulevard Mall is making so many wonderful changes.. But  this Hot dog on a stick stands out. With its amazing employee Hailey.. She is a great employee with an amazing personality. She treated my daughter and I so nice. the food was amazing.. I can't wait to go back.  I wish there were more employees in customer service like her. We are a million percent happy with our experience!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"Stood in line and then ignored.  Didn't eat here and now never will.  Much better options with way better customer service nearby"}
{"text":"Ended up walking out. Sat in the drive thru for 15 minutes and didn't move. Backed out went inside and waited for another 10 minutes without being helped. Left, went to Dairy Queen. The car ahead of us was still sitting in the drive thru when we left Dairy Queen. I am all about hiring young kids, but make sure they can handle the responsibility and can keep up when busy. I saw two other people leave as well!!"}
{"text":"We went this Friday and had an ok experience. We ordered cheese filled, fries and lemonade. There was no frozen available though. There were several people after us that ended up not ordering because there weren't any hot dogs."}
{"text":"Clearly way understaffed should not take 15 minutes to get to the counter to order just a lemonade.Hopefully management will hire more employees so this will not happen to other customers."}
{"text":"Drove by and saw this open in my area and I squealed with delight!! I dislike shopping malls but I'm a big fan of Corn Dogs! Sampled their chicken strips! Very light breading flavorful! Need a refreshing beverage? Let the multi colored weird cap wearing employees quench your thirst with Icy cold fresh lemonade! You KNOW you want one!  The only reason I cannot give this location 5 stars, as I left my cup was full of ice , I asked as it was so hot out for water to top it off.  The employee sneered at me as if it was a major inconvenience and like I had asked for something shockingly out of all reason!"}

{"text":"I've been to this location many times, this time was the absolute worst experience ever! Last week my kids, husband and I waited in line for over 35 minutes, while two people stood in the back texting and goofing off. I was infuriated. Tonight, there were three people working, but they were so stoned and wreaked of marijuana. I wouldn't care so much, except they didn't have a manager to get me change for a $100. Ok I was like whatever, I'll walk somewhere else and get change. It took me so long because nobody wants to just give you change ya know. There were people behind me waiting and the nice man in his army uniform paid for my meal to keep the line moving. I totally appreciated that but, he should not have had to do that! I should have been able to pay for his meal instead since he is serving my country. They need to get this HDOAS back on track! My kids always ask for their lemonade and I hate having to deal with bs every time. Where are the managers, were are the owners?!"}
{"text":"Completely awesome customer service. We changed our order a couple times and she was completely calm and happy to help us. More than amazing. Definitely returning for life."}
{"text":"Just like at the mall hot dogs on a stick and lemonade were soo good  also the funnel sticks were a hit with my husband.
Please clean your bathroom and tables the whole establishment needs some TLC."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the level of service I received. Kylie the employee was rude while taking my order. As I was waiting for my order I noticed a shift change. The new girl coming in saw me waiting and informed me that she had to throw away the ones that Kylie started because she didn't know how to work the equipment and it would be another 5 minute wait. Wish there was a way to give less than one star"}
{"text":"Two stars because a half star is not an option. The batter on the hot dog was over cooked and not golden vron. And the potion of funnel cake sticks was a sad excuse of a serving. Overall disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been *craving* a cheese stick so one o' those... Xtra mustard!... funnel sticks for dee-sert... and cherry lemonade!! Yummy, cheap, mall food court... this is what I call \"simple pleasures\" when feeding my cravings. 

** For vegetarians- veggie dogs are available just not something I like. 
Also, as a girl who formally worked for coffee shops do \"right\" by the employees and upsell to a larger size for that extra $0.50 cents :)"}
{"text":"They use a vegan veggie dog WIN! but then they go and put egg and milk into the batter FAIL! 

Oh well. No hot dog on a stick for me! 

Oh! And there is casein in fries...ICK. No fries for me!

Their cherry lemonade is good. I hope it doesn't have egg or dairy in it also! Geeze!"}
{"text":"Came in around 1242pm....food always good. Props to Thalia for working the drive thru and front....handled it like a pro....hang in there your doing great!"}
{"text":"Well I'll be a monkey's uncle.. you no longer have to brave the crowds at the mall to get your Hot Dog on a Stick fix.. Although I feel like it tastes different when you're eating it at the mall. Does anyone share that sentiment? No? Okay..

Anyways, what's not to love about HDOAS? The cheese on a stick is always to die for. Chili cheese fries are a heaping pile of wonderful stomach pains. 

Only thing about this location that isn't up to par is the fact that they leave one guy working during the lunch rush, every time we've been there. So one poor soul running around like a chicken with his head cut off, cooking, running drive through, and taking orders up front. Give these guys some help! GREAT service from the young man working there today, even though I felt AWFUL for how busy he was. He handled it well. :)"}
{"text":"Been here twice already while in the area. I love seeing a location with a drive thru and not in a mall.

First visit - excellent customer service but he gave me the wrong drink.

Second visit - horrible customer service but my order is perfect. 

I'm never out on this side of town much but at least I know the food here is good and convenient!"}
{"text":"Overpriced french fries ($3.25 for not nearly the amount of fries expected at that price).
Need i say more."}
{"text":"I grew up with this place! My cousins worked at the one in the meadows, and my mom would leave me there while shopping at Macy's. Then, there's the OG at the SM pier. Glad we have a drive through, at ours. Glad I don't have to be in SM! Everytime we go, we get discounts. I don't eat hot dogs, but they offer vegan and turkey. The vegan tastes so much like a hot dog, it's scary."}
{"text":"This was my first Hot Dog On A Stick experience that wasn't in a mall. I must say I love this location! For the first time I was able to enjoy my food without teenage thugs all up in my business. John was very friendly and helpful and even did a great non annoying upsale. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Customer service  is everything when working for a company. The service is not supposed to change based on the color or gender of the person you are catering to at the time. Two of your workers one by the name of deonte proceeded to give great service to the customers before us and then when it was our time to order, we could feel that the service was sub par and mediocre because of who we were as people. I don't know what we did in the time waiting in line to order but it was highly unappreciated, unacceptable, and unprofessional as another person that works customer service"}
{"text":"Teeny tiny but adequate. Clean. Pleasant staff. Only one girl working so I'm sure it could get crazy busy. Unlike the old mall days, you can't really watch them cooing or making the lemonade. That takes some of the fun out for the kids. Overall a pleasant enough experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service! And unsanitary I have seen hot dogs being thawed out in the hand washing sink and frozen funnel cake sticks laying around n the counter in a 1/3 rd pan along with fries in a container with no label, they put a sign up saying they would be back in 10 minutes but the left it up for 50 mins and then came back and closed the store and turned the lights off! Great job to the staff on 12/9/17"}
{"text":"They were training someone who I could not hear. But my complaint is the corn dogs. They were way way way over done and did not taste good. I'll never eat there again. Frozen corn dogs taste better. 2 stars because the lemonade and fries were good."}
{"text":"Went there this afternoon and there were 2 African American girls working. The heavy set one took my oder and was nice at first. I had 2 refill cups that I brought with me and when I touched MY cup she kinda just looked at me with so much attitude. Usually I have a pretty good experience here, they usually are extremely nice but not this time. Now I know not to come with that particular girl working."}
{"text":"This place is just good. I like that the corn dogs are all beef and made fresh to order. I like to come on double stamp days (Mondays and Wednesdays) because my card fills up fast and then when it does I get a free menu item. The employees are friendly and remember you. If you want to sample any of the lemonades just ask and they will give you a taste. The beef on a stick is always good but the pepper jack cheese on a stick goes nice with it. The cheese on a stick isn't too spicy but still has a nice little zing. I tried the funnel cake sticks and they were made perfect. Not much greasy and not as sweet as they appeared. There is a drive thru here if you don't want to go inside."}
{"text":"FIRST!!!  Ok I have had HDOAS 3 times in my life and each of those times were ehhhh.  Until I had it recently from this place.  Service was fast, friendly and great.  I had the Cheese on a stick and some fries and they even asked how crispy before I could request that!  AWESOME!!!!!  This place is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today to get a quick corn dog and was impressed with the young man who helped me. Ricky was polite, funny and knew how to treat a customer. From taking my order, giving me a free sample of their chili (which I will totally order next time) to having a great conversation and meanwhile getting my order ready. Since this place is only right down the street from my work, I will totally be back. This kid has a bright future."}
{"text":"The people are not the best here anymore. Instead of that happy smile you'll receive awkward passive aggressive comments. Just had a bad encounter with who I think was the manager. She was horrible and so rude. We get it ! You hate your job!"}
{"text":"The food and drink is always exactly the same. This review is based solely on the customer service...

I've worked in customer service for over 20 years. People are a$$holes. Plain and simple. It's not this guys fault you didn't hear him call your name twice because you were taking selfies at your table. It's not his fault I was in line before you and your job only allows you a 15 minute break. Don't ask him how much longer till you get service when I'm standing there paying my bill. You're rude lady! And sometimes you're really busy and there's no more orange lemonade for 5 minutes. Get over it!!! These kids don't deserve your condescending, holier than thou, attention starved bad attitudes. With a smile, this young man was calm and took every rude comment. He even apologized to ME! He sat there while you took out your crappy life on him. 

These people , YES THEY'RE PEOPLE TOO, deserve just as much respect as the next guy. Think about that next time you're having a bad day and be nice, get your cheese stick and shut up! 

Didn't catch his name. I assume it's 
Shawn L. from my receipt. Tall, skinny, dark hair and glasses. You're doing a phenomenal job!!"}
{"text":"Their Turkey dogs are good but their Cheese on a Stick is amazing. I have to stay away because man could I eat these all day. Their fries are not my favorite, the funnel cake is okay. I definitely only crave the cheese stick and their lemonade, always great. I do not like the flavors or the lite lemonade because of the sweetener after taste. If you like Diet Coke you won't notice, which is great because less sugar."}
{"text":"We are from Cali and know the real deal Hot Dog on a stick...because we have been going there since my daughter was a kid (shes an adult now) to the original Santa Monica location on the beach...I cannot say enough good things about the GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE...The young lady was cheerful and very eager to make us happy..Well we came back this Labor Day and went thru drive thru and Ricky the manager was so delightful....we bought everything he upsold to us!!! The food was great and another staff came and brought samples of their new chili which is delish!!! I let him know I love the energy and since Henderson does not have great customer service for people of color...Im speaking out!!!! Love the staff here and going to write a letter to corporate because YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME JUST LIKE CALI!!!! Keep up the great work...we will be back very soon and gonna tell everyone I know...and Im not even a hot dog person really!!!"}
{"text":"It is an immutable fact that everything is better on a stick.  Steak?  Great.  Steak kebabs?  Awesome.  Mango lassi?  Delicious.  Mango lassi popsicles?  Amazing.  Hot dogs?  Scrumptious.  Corn dogs?  Heavenly.  Apples?  Pretty good.  Caramel apples on a stick?  Yes, please!  Jar Jar Binks?  Completely intolerable.  Jar Jar Binks impaled by an iLightsaber and propped up?  A wonderful experience.  Course, that last one might have more to do with the fact that he's dead at that point, but still...

So, Hot Dog on a Stick?  Well of course it's going to be delicious!  The hot dogs they use are full of flavour, the batter is clearly laced with Celonian huffing spices, and they're typically cooked to perfection.  Their lemonade, whilst not actually on a stick, tastes about as good as any drink possibly can without truthfully being on a stick.  Last time The Dark Side had filled me with murderous rage, Yoda just calmly handed me a corn dog and a drink from here, and suddenly everything was OK again.  That's how powerful these products are.  Earth has been spared on more than one occasion because of this place.

It's mall food, which means you never know what kind of service you're going to get.  For that, I'll dock it a point.  But otherwise?  Generally if I'm in a food court and see one, I'll make a line for it.  Unfortunately, there aren't too many of them up here where I've headquartered the New Empire, but whenever I'm in Vegas and wanting to go look at a crashed UFO and wonder why the hell the Deathstar's designers didn't take aerodynamics into consideration when creating it, I'll grab a dog on a stick and a lemonade from here.

4 Deathstars."}
{"text":"Silly me! Out wandering around at the Fashion Show Mall and decide to grab a hot dog on a stick. Delightful! The young gentleman behind the counter was polite, courteous, friendly and made the perfect lunch for me. Also, the lemonade really hit the spot!
Hur-raw for Hot Dog On A Stick!"}
{"text":"I've always been in love with Hot Dog on a Stick, but the price at the malls deteriorated me from coming to any location. But, this location is much cheaper than the mall. More importantly, they have a drive-thru option! How amazing is that? Everyone is always nice, and always offering an upgrade with cup size which I am a sucker for. On top of that, 25% off with check-in. Can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"I was in love with Hot Dog on a Stick as a child growing up in California and every time I go to Las Vegas I HAVE TO get a corndog and that sweet homemade lemonade at Fashion Show Mall. I love that they hand dip their corn dogs (fresh never frozen!) and that they come out piping hot and delicious!! You can actually see them making the fresh lemonade (also yum!!) - it makes quite the refreshing treat after a long day at the mall/walking the strip. If you are a fan of corn dogs, you need to come here. If getting excited about corn dogs is wrong, then I don't want to be right."}
{"text":"After they closed the location at Fashion Show I was determined to find another location and was excited to find out that this place was open at the Excalibur food court. However, for some reason the food was just not as good as I've come to expect. The corn dog tasted oily like they needed to change out the fryer oil. We spent $9 for two hot dogs on a stick and we could have eaten somewhere else :(. Sad sad sad."}
{"text":"I lived in California when I was little and I've been a fan of Hot Dog on A Stick since I was a child. When I was scanning the list of restaurants and stores at Town Square I was so excited to see that they had one! This is the perfect spot to grab a quick bite to eat in between shopping or before/after going to the movies. My boyfriend and I both got corn dogs (2 for $6) and their fabulous lemonade. We had to wait a bit since they make everything fresh, but that's the best part in my opinion. The corndogs were just as I remembered and the cashier that served us was very nice."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from this location. I usually love his place but I definitely got food poisoning, everyone who went with me did as well. Which is disgusting because how dirty did that hot dog have to be to be fried in super hot oil and still get people sick? Bleck"}
{"text":"I love this place, always have lol but you will spend some dough there.  The food always great !! But it will cost you ..lol"}
{"text":"Friendly Service! Freshly Squeezed Lemonade, Perfect Hot Dogs on a Stick!!! They even have Chicken Tenders, CHILI CHEESE FRIES (BOMB.COM) and BREAKFAST SAUSAGE ON A STICK!!!  (Served all day) it goes well with pancake syrup too mmm yummy! You can't find the Sausage on a stick and the chili cheese fries at mall locations only at the Drive Thrus! I love to come here during their LUNCH SPECIAL!!! MONDAY TO FRIDAY from 11am to 3pm any stick item, fries, and a regular size lemonade starting at ONLY $5.99!!! WHAT A GREAT DEAL!!! Ask for a punch card too! Monday and Wednesdays are DOUBLE STAMP days and once you reach up to 13 stamps you are eligible to get a free regular item!!!

Then next time I pass by i'll make sure to spot by and get a refreshing ORANGE or BLUE RASPBERRY LEMONADE my FAVORITE =)!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that they have a Drive Thru! Skipping all the crazyness at the Meadows Mall food court."}
{"text":"The hotdogs are turkey you can get beef or a veggie a stick . The lemonade is made old fashioned way . They are clean and simple"}
{"text":"Being from Texas, and not a fan of malls, I had no idea what this place was when I drove by after moving in nearby. But that changed today.

Swung through the drive thru today after my workout- gotta stay fat somehow, right?
In any case, the line wasn't long but the wait kind of was: was probably probably in line about ten minutes.

Ordered the beef hot dog on a stick and the american cheese on a stick. No clue what to expect, I usually just hit up Sonic when the random corndog craving strikes. But with the rave reviews here, surely this place was something special.

Got home and shared my treats with the BF: I got a bite or two of the dog with some regular Frech's before he inhaled the rest with some spicy brown mustard. Both of us were perplexed by the cheese on a stick (american)- seems like it's supposed to be their take on a grilled cheese, and it's not bad, just... odd. 

Probably won't be by often, but definitely giving an extra star for the spicy brown mustard- will scoop up an extra packet or three next time I go in."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Hot Dog on a Stick with a drive through! What else could we want in life!!"}
{"text":"I remember going to hot dog on a stick at the meadows mall when I was like 13 and it was goooood. I remember the goofy uniforms the employees had to wear and laughing when I saw someone I knew who worked there =p. 

I was hungry after work but didn't want something heavy. I remembered hearing this place had opened up and had a drive thru! It isn't too far from work so I headed over. I missed the place the first time around. You have to turn into the shopping center with the stop light to get into the parking lot otherwise you can't get to the restaurant. Eventually after turning down a side street and turning again I was back on Charleston and turned into the plaza. I made it! 

I ordered a beef hot dog on a stick and a pepper jack cheese on a stick. It was almost $7 for the 2 items. I don't normally buy corn dogs so I don't know if the price is good, but $3 something for a corn dog seems a bit high to me. It took a few minutes to prepare my food but when I bit into the corn dog it was warm. Same thing with the cheese. I expected hot gooey and cheesy but it was just warm. Even the batter on the outside wasn't crunchy. I was disappointed. The food was good, but I was expecting more. Maybe I went on an off night? Maybe that is the normal temp of their foods? I know they are supposed to batter and cook everything fresh to order so I don't really know what the deal was. I probably will try them again if I'm in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}

I would have preferred a smile from the employee, but she seemed forlorn or otherwise distracted. Tried talking with her and making jokes but she didn't even crack a smile. 

Didn't make for a happy experience. I remember as a kid/teen loving the experience of ordering from the Hot Dog on a Stick from the smiling girls working there."}
{"text":"Frozen cherry / strawberry lemonade for the win.. ALWAYS!! cheese in a stick.. Uh... Well.. No"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The only reason I'm giving this place such a low rating though is because of a staff member. 

I completely understand that you're gonna chit chat when it's slow. But I think out of respect, you should stop when you have customers in front of you. When I was there the other day, Gabby would continue to talk. The other person she worked with greeted EVERY customer and did all of the register work while she yapped away in the background. She wasn't even having an appropriate conversation either. She was talking down about an old friend of hers and even called the person a \"dumbass\" right in front of customers.

This is not good customer service. The girl is young, but she should be taught some work ethic. She should stop talking so much when there is customers and actually work. Not just stand around.

Other than that, I enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"Oh man, their lemonade is good here! Sometimes I drive to the mall just because I'm craving some of the lemonade at HDOS! They sell a souvenir cup that's slightly larger than the large cup but gets you $2 refills when you bring it back. What a deal! Sometimes I forget to bring it though :(

Love their turkey dogs and cheese on a stick. I don't know what it is, but they're just better than corn dogs elsewhere...must be the batter. The employees here are always friendly and serve your food/drinks with a smile on their face. They even warn you how hot your food is going to be because it comes fresh out of the fryer and onto a tray. 

Wish their pricing was a little lower though, but oh well they know I'll be back regardless! If you come here often be sure to ask for a stamp card so you can work your way up to a free item."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were in Fiesta Mall waiting for some eyeglasses to be made, so we wondered down to the food court.  We had a coupon for this place, and it's' as good as any other in this old outdated mall.  They dip the dogs right before they cook them, so that's a good thing.  But the dogs came out and they were really greasy, so that tells me either the grease is really old, it's not hot enough, or both.  We also got some churros, and I think I had a small heart attack after I ate them, they were so greasy.  I guess if you are hard up for something to eat, then this would be your place."}
{"text":"It's okay....they don't have the punch cards so that kinda was a let down, love the drive thru but my cheese sticks are always exploded when I get them"}
{"text":"The guy in the drive thru was soooo sweet! Best customer service I have had in a long time! And my cheese didn't explode out my cheesticks and love the drive thru! Bring 1 to Summerlin and fast!"}
{"text":"Never seen one of these outside of a mall, so you can imagine my surprise when on my way to my typical sandwich shop, I spotted this hidden gem, and to boot, it had a drive-thru. Shut. Your. Mouth. Service was friendly, just remember that they're frying up your Dog on a Stick when you order it, so it's not lightning-speed service; you may have to wait a bit, but it will be oh-so-worth-it. Keep your peepers open, because if you blink you'll drive right by it!!"}
{"text":"Well I see all the good reviews but I'm not sure how. I've been waiting in this drive through for over 17mins and the girl keeps repeating the wrong order to me. I have a court hearing in 10 mins and I'm not sure how I'm going to make it since I am still waiting in drive through. I'm sure the 4 other vehicles behind me are pretty upset. Smh... 20 mins later I finally got my food."}
{"text":"Came here as we were visiting from Seattle area and they all closed down near us.  The food was great as usual, and the guy working at the counter (Rodrigo) was very friendly and great customer service you don't normally get in a fast food restaurant , especially a food court.  The 60 calorie large lemondade was great as well."}
{"text":"Located in the Excalibur food court and like all other Hot Dog on a Stick locations, it is a great place to get a snack or some lemonade. However, if you're looking to have a full meal it may get a little pricey. The employees are very nice, fast and efficient even when this place gets busy and a line forms. I would highly recommend their lemonade, get the lime/green one!"}
{"text":"Yum! Fried cheese on a stick?!? How can you go wrong? Okay maybe you're cholesterol won't like it but it's so yummy! We always make sure we come here while we're in town !"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying Hot Dog on a Stick and let me say I'm a fan!!!! I loved corn dogs but boy oh boy do they do them right. I loved that they were made fresh and their lemonade is amazeballs. Yes, this is technically mall food (or even carnival food) but it really hits the spot. I wish I would've ordered two. Looks like I have a new reason to head to the mall."}
{"text":"I have to admit... Hot dog on a stick is one of my all time favorite guilty pleasures. Well that was until 4 days ago. I had been kind of sad hearing they had removed the HDOAS from fashion show and boulevard malls and I was a little nervous I was going to have withdrawals, but then I remembered this location and off I was to take care of my craving. I pull up to the drive thru and the menu of course reads all about the basic 5 items menu but they do have a combo of - 4 sticks, 1 funnel cake sticks, 1 fry and 1 lemonade for $12.99 so I figured let's just do it. Not only did it take them 20 mins while I was in the drive thru waiting but then the sticks (hot dog and cheese) were so over breaded you couldn't even eat it and then by the time you got to the meat or cheese it was cold! And my lite lemonade tasted like it was made from drain cleaner. I will never go to this location again, to be honest I might never eat HDOAS ever again. So sad :"}
{"text":"It had probably been twenty years since I had tried any hotdogs on a stick and now I remember why.  We ordered three hotdogs on a bun, one on a stick, chicken tenders and two lemonades and that came to OVER $30.  Okay.

Let me start by saying I've never felt more ripped off in my life.  Tiny shriveled hotdogs and third-rate chicken.  I mean seriously, if the hotdogs were $0.99 instead of $3.85 I might not be writing this...but they weren't.  Likewise, the chicken was thickly breaded and looked like it had been deep fried some weeks ago and merely heated up...in fact, I'm nearly sure that is how it was.  The actual \"hotdog on a stick\" we got, according to my wife, was fine.

I will give them high marks on their fine lemonades.  They were tasty and great.

In short, I would have to be starving and this be literally the last restaurant on earth before I'd go back.  It was that bad...and a horrific value proposition, especially when you consider the excellent Costco hotdogs just a few miles away.

I predict this location will close down within less than a year - it is a weird location with a weird drive-thru and inadequate signage."}
{"text":"Great service fast and fresh food was fantastic restaurant was really clean as well as the restroom neat and clean appearance by both employees and did i mention the service was GREAT and they were moving cleaning as they had time to lean time to clean Great job guys thank you."}
{"text":"I know it's only hot dogs...and I only eat them here.

Nevertheless...it's clean, the staff is beyond pleasant and I flat dream about that lemonade. Come on, like it's only me... 

They have a plastic refillable deal...yeah I got it :)"}
{"text":"Great place! I visited late so there was only one worker but she got the food reasonably quickly (4 minutes). The signature lemonade was very good and the turkey hot dog was great as ever."}
{"text":"My fiancé was craving hot dog on a stick so we decided to go get some at this location. We decided to get the sampler platter which brings 4 dogs fries & dessert sticks all for $13.99 i think for the price it should of at least included a small drink I mean come on $2.99 for a drink ridiculous but anyways everything tasted very good & fresh fries were like McDonald's fries funnel sticks were good as well & the dogs were very tasty. Recommend it but bring your own drink because drink prices are little high."}
{"text":"Stopped by this location on my way home. After all, how could I say no to Hot Dog On A Stick?! It's a quiet Wednesday and there's no line to wait in.

I ordered off the \"Fresh Made to Order $5.55 \" menu and it hit the spot. One cheese dog and one corn dog for me pleassssee!! Staff was nice, offered me a receipt, offered to sign me up for rewards program, and said thank you. 

Food was exactly was I was expecting. 100% hit the spot!!

Tip: The now have Turkey Dogs and Veggie Dogs!"}
{"text":"Wow! Talk about customer service! They are very friendly here and attentive. I was impressed. I dined in and they brought me my food and i had never tried the mozzarella sticks so the gave me a sample. So very nice.  They were all friendly but a shout out to Daniella for her kindness and great attitude!"}
{"text":"Pros-
 * every Tuesday corndogs are a BUCK!
 * fast service
 * friendly staff
 
Cons - 
 * N/A

Tips-
* Keep your lemonade / chiller cups for a refill.  They charge, but it's less than a dollar to refill.
* Try the funnel cake stick  $2.75   (free samples available)"}
{"text":"Long ago, I used to be a loyal Hot Dog on A Stick employee. I don't frequent it as much as I used to, but nostalgia always brings me back! This particular location in Town Square captures all the good things about this staple mall food that I've always loved. One of the things this location has (that I'm not sure if others have) are great combo deals and discounts, so you can load up on all the delicious fried food, for much less. The funnel cake sticks here are well done, but there's a funnel cake place right next door too. 

Pro Tip: Park in the South parking structure for an easy walk to their outside stand."}
{"text":"I am a cheese lover and I love the pepper jack cheese on a stick! The best comfort food!!"}
{"text":"Friendly employees, easy access, convenient and as good as ever! They offer lite lemonade-who knew?! All the flavor, not all the sugar! The drive thru makes this an easy in, easy out stop for a quick lunch or snack. The wait is the normal time for Hot Dog in a Stick-not too quick but not exactly slow, either. 

This location is almost hidden-I wish they'd advertise it more or at least make the outside signage more noticeable from the street. It's on the southeast corner of Warm Springs and Arroyo Grande and it's in the same building as TGI Flowers. The drive thru is a little hard to find but its there!

Bottom line: quick and easy as per the usual Hot Dog on a Stick you know and love."}
{"text":"Very good/fast service!! Food is great and frozen lemonade does the job in this 100+ degree heat"}
{"text":"I am not huge on writing reviews about chains. I mean, its Hot Dog on a Stick, you pretty much know what to expect. But this particular location tops them all, and I think they deserve a fair review telling people they are not just the average. 
For one, I was stoked to find out I can now go to a drive thru to get my favorite corn dog and lemonade. WOOOHOO!!!! But they also stepped the game up, offering chicken fingers, funnel cake, and orange and blue lemonade. I personally have only seen the cherry, lime, or light versions. 
Also, the service is the best customer service in Vegas, period. Often, when you dine at fast food chains, employees aren't happy, or they don't care. Well here, one at least 3 occasions, we were treated with spectacular service and smiles. One time, in the drive through, they gave us each a sample of chicken fingers. This most recent time, we came in right when they opened so we had to wait about 5-7 minutes for the batter to be fully done. So they gave us some free funnel cake sticks for the inconvenience. (Which there really wasn't one)
I love the fact that they welcome you. I love that they offer beef, turkey, cheese, or veggie dogs. I love the lime lemonade. I just love this place and if I am ever craving a deep fried dog- I know right where to go!"}
{"text":"I love hotdog on a stick, I hate going to the mall. When I got word of this free standing location, I ignored my gluten free diet and indulged. It was so good, I got 3 corn dogs and 2 lemonades. It was one of the best meals I had in months. It's very expensive for what it is, but worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ever seeing a hot dog on a stick that wasn't in a mall. Seeing that they had a drive thru convinced me even more to swing by. Took them a few minutes to actually take my order, but once they did, it was smooth sailing the rest of the way. I'm very indecisive sometimes. I usually end up wanting to order the whole menu when that happens. This lady was very nice, friendly and patient. I ordered everything that was her favorite since I've only eaten at this place twice in my life. For fast food though, I feel the food here was pretty fresh and the mango lemonade was amazing! I'm not a big fan of going to fast food joints let alone rating them, but I see myself returning here in the near future."}
{"text":"As always, super tasty. Fun staff here, great attitudes. Love the lemonade choices that seem to get better and better. Prices still very fair for this 40+ year old franchise. Always will be a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Simplicity. Corn dog, fries and a large lemonade. For $10? I'll take it! dip the dog n fries in some ketchup and follow it with a sip of lemonade. comfort food all the way. I also like they cook everything to order. service is friendly and polite. if your ever craving a corn dog..forget those frozen microwaveable kind. Get your butt to your nearest hotdog on a stick location!"}
{"text":"So I don't really review chain spots like Hot Dog but this location is a little different in a good way and deserving of being yelped. Main reasons this Hot Dog on a Stick got 4 stars:

1. It's not located inside of a mall.  
2. It has a drive-thru!
3. The got a 25% off yelp check in bonus.
4. Food specials every day of the week!
5. Bigger menu featuring turkey dogs, chicken fingers and meal combos with cheaper prices.

So yeah its not your typical Hot Dog on a Stick. The lime lemonade is delicious and the cheese/veggie on a stick options means there is something for everyone! Customer service was awesome. The employees were really nice and had suggestions for everything. Food came out quickly and tasted great. Way better than the shopping mall locations."}
{"text":"Loved the ice cold lemonade & cherry slush lemonade to wash down all the fried goodies. And who doesn't love hot dogs?! We tried the sampler that comes with 4 varieties of dogs of your choice - (Nathan's all beef, turkey, veggie, or a cheese dog- pepper jack, mozzarella or cheddar cheeses)  All are corn dog style. Also comes with an order of fries and funnel fries topped with powdered sugar. 

I was really surprised how yummy the veggie dog was, a lower calorie option and tasty, too! And you've got to try these funnel fries for dessert with a cherry slush lemonade- so good and perfect in this warm weather. Grab a seat under the umbrella seating right behind the kiosk - they deliver your meal right to you. I have to say, for fast food we had great service, and even got to try a sampler of their tasty cherry lemonade- which we of course had to have MORE OF! We'll be back again after our next shopping day."}
{"text":"I don't know where all of the Hot Dog on a Stick went but I am so happy to have found them! I didn't have to drive to the mall, get out of my car, and walk all around the mall to find a Hot Dog on a Stick. This was so easy to get to. The best part is: they have a drive thru! 

It's just how I remembered it. Delicious hot dog on a stick, French fries, and their delicious funnel cake sticks. Everything was made fresh. And when I asked for extra powdered sugar, they did not hold back! Excellent customer service. They even offered me a little smoothie sample while I waited. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Located in the Fashion show mall, this place is very convenient for me while I'm at work.

The main reason I started coming here was because I have been on a diet for the past 4 months, and a corn dog is one of the only things besides salad at the food court that is under 300 calories!....... And is still tasty. It's an all-turkey dog, and even with the batter, it's 250 calories total.

Most of the employees here are pleasant enough, and I KNOW the lemonade at this location is fresh because I see them churning it almost every other time I go there.

The only issues is that two separate times I have ordered a corn dog there, the inside batter has not been cooked all the way. They have no issue making you a new one, but still. Ew. 

I might have to try the fried cheese on a stick too. Apparently, it's super yummy."}
{"text":"This is the first hot dog on a stick I've been to where they don't freshly squeeze sugar free lemonade for you...and ask you how many Splendas you'd like.  The food court was slow as molasses...but I guess that's just a time saving technique.  

The hot dog was cooked well...not overly cooked.  Overall, your usual fare.  3 stars."}
{"text":"The food is great as always, but Lesley was rude and seams like she would rather be doing something else. (Hint hint management.)"}
{"text":"Yes, I'm giving Hot Dog on A Stick 5 stars! I have nothing negative to say about my experience, it was actually above and beyond what I would ever expect from a Hot Dog on A Stick. I had only seen Hot Dog on A Stick in the food court at the mall before, so I was surprised to see a location in a small shopping center AND it has a drive-thru! Score! I was greeted by Casper, who went over the menu and specials. On Mondays & Wednesdays you can get double stamps on your rewards card. After you buy any 13 items you get 1 free! Don't forget to ask for a card! Casper also said that when it comes to drink sizes, the souvenir cup is $4 and some change, but you get $2 refills. This ends up a great deal if you plan on coming back. Casper also gave me a sample of their new orange lemonade flavor and it was refreshing.

I started out with a \"Cheese on a Stick\" priced at $2.85 and chose the American cheese (they also have pepper jack). Yum! This one isn't as big as the regular hot dog on a stick, but is very cheesy and was my favorite! Next I had the \"Beef on a Stick\" priced at $3.35 and again was pleased. The corn dog was made with an all-beef Nathan's hot dog. The corn dogs are battered and cooked fresh to order and both of mine were cooked perfect. 

Aside from corn dogs, on the menu you will find funnel cake sticks, french fries, hot dogs (in a bun!) and of course lemonade that is made fresh about every 2 hours in a variety of yummy flavors."}
{"text":"Another one of the new places in the food court at the Excalibur Hotel. Like the other food places there, they are currently offering special deals so be sure to take advantage of them while you still can! I recommend getting their lemonade if you feel like drinking something chilled and refreshing (and are tired of drinking water lol). Also a good place for a quick bite. Their fries are pretty good."}
{"text":"Not everyone can afford or always wants expensive fine dining while visiting Vegas. There is nothing fancy about hot dog on a stick, but in my opinion good food doesn't have to be fancy. This place is perfect for a quick inexpensive bite, and who doesn't love a corn dog? Staff were friendly and prices are very reasonable. I always stop and get a hot dog on a stick when I'm in Excalibur."}
{"text":"Thalia & Autumn are both sweethearts!  very good customer service & because of them i will be back! Thank you ladies! :)"}
{"text":"I love hot dog on a stick. Been going when I was a kid growing up in Southern California. They use all beef or turkey hot dogs and they are so tasty and crispy. I like mine with mustards. The cherry lemonade is too die for."}
{"text":"Hey folks--as a former hotdogger (5 years at the SF and Daly City locations)--I know what is expected of you. If I approach the counter, I shouldn't have to stand there and wait for someone to come out from the back room. And then it happened twice--the veggie dog was excellent as always. Where was the peel in my lemonade? That's just HDS 101. Dave's watching you, you know. Then I came back to refill my lemonade and I waited even longer for someone to appear. When I asked for a refill--not a free one--just a refill that doesn't waste another cup, the girl told me, \"That's at the full price.\" Yeah...I just didn't want to waste another giant cup--I know you have to count the cups at night, but heaven forbid you're one cup over. But whatever, I'm just a California hippie."}
{"text":"Who hasn't had Hot Dog On A Stick!?!?

They seemed to be in EVERY shopping  mall across the U.S.!!!

They taste better than the one you get at the fair IMO....

I love the fact that they are made to order, and the simplest way I like to enjoy a Hot Dog On A Stick is a little mustard...:9

Service is great here, suggestions are offered if you can't decide what to get, and spin the wheel for any purchase over $10 to win a prize (every spin is a winner!)

Their lemonade is a perfect complement as well, and you can get it straight up, or with a flavor pump, transform it to Cherry, Blue Raspberry, Orange, or Limeade.

Hot Dog On A Stick has enough of a cult following that  there are multiple free sanding locations around town....

There's a drive thru at this location if you don't feel like dining in...

Get the souvenir cup for $2 refills at any location....Gotta love those funky uniforms too, but why don't the guys have to wear the funky hats???   ALOHA!!!!"}
{"text":"Someone please update these poor folks outfits they have to wear to work here!!!!!!! Other than that, the dogs and the cheese on a stick are simply yummy!"}
{"text":"My dad grew up in California and we've always had family there. Needless to say we've been out there a lot and had the joy of eating hot dog on a stick. It was always a favorite must have. I recently got to take my husband and he loved it. It's as good as I remember. You can't beat a cheese on a stick."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Cheese on a Stick?  My absolute fave that I must have whenever I see a Hot Dog on a Stick.  This was in the Fashion Show Mall food court and the only downside was the line of other HDOS fans.  Other than that, service was great and the food was cheesy and delish! :)

Thanks, cheese, for being so awesome and delicious!"}
{"text":"Officially hooked. 

Again. 

Been going religiously like every week now to this stand alone location. What a convenient godsend! Okay maybe godsend is pushin' it. Demigod send then. 

There's something nostalgic about this place. just reminds me of being a kid again.. Minus having to walk into a mall. With a drive thru to boot! 

Now I've managed to get my coworker hooked (again) as well and drag him down with me. What's there not to love? Freshly dipped corndogs, clean set-up, VEGGIE corndogs(!), wack retro throwback uniforms, lemonade freshly made every couple hours (according to them) and its a co-op! All definite brownie points in my opinion!

Got my souvenir cup at the ready 24/7 you already know."}
{"text":"Just sat in the drive thru 15 minutes for them to tell  me my order wasn't even started. This location needs help from the mall workers."}
{"text":"As we walked around the food court at Excalibur, I noticed someone carrying a tremendous, golden brown, crispy-fried corn dog. Hello, delicious food on a stick! I wasn't really in a \"hot dog mood\".  I never am, to be honest, but after giving up on the other lack of options, we went back to look at the menu. 

Holy veggie hot dog! What are you doing up there??!! I had no idea this place also fries up veggie dogs. On a stick. In golden brown, fried dough!  I was a little reluctant. Would it look the same? How would it taste? I didn't know, but I gave it a shot and hot diggity dog I'm glad I did.  Yum yum yum.  

While the veggie dog (mine)($3.69) and beef dog (husband's)($4.39) were cooked in the same fryer, I thought about the surprising fact that the veggie dog was less expensive! How is that possible?!  We ordered a fry to share ($2.79) and a Light Lemonade (with sugar substitute) ($3.69 for large)

Everything was really good. We were the last customer of the night or else I probably would've ordered another dog, even though I really wasn't that hungry after the first one.  I wish EVERY food establishment would have a veggie option. Most of the time it's going to be a very tasty, healthier, guilt-free treat.  I do eat meat, but if there's a veggie option, I always take it! Glad I did here, The food was great!"}
{"text":"I made a quick stop in and got the most wonderful service from Taylor. There was a wait and she quickly greeted me and let me know she would be right with me. While ordering she offered me additional food options to try, which I appreciated although I refused. After ordering she brought out a small sample of frozen cherry lemonade while I waited. Fantastic service experience."}
{"text":"What can I say a Hot dog on a Stick with more flavors and menu items than the mall. Best corn dogs and cheese sticks around. I had blueberry Lemonade and two of the bigger Nathan all beef corn dogs with spicy mustard, All was great I do want to come back for the funnel cake sticks."}
{"text":"Oh how I will miss this place. :( 
Their last day was the previous Sunday. The manager had always knew what I wanted everytime. She let me know a week before that they were closing since I was a regular. I'm extremely sad to see them go with their amazing lemonade and the prices for the 44oz stadium cup I bought twice. Now I have a stadium cup and no amazing lemonade."}
{"text":"The manager at this location is just so friendly. Always striking good conversations and always providing samples! They are always on top of things and for being new to Townsquare have already made a good impression on all the mall employees here and the customers! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great lemonade hotdogs cheesesticks chicken the new chile fries nice so glad its out of the mall easy access drive thru sweet hope more r coming"}
{"text":"I don't corn dog much but when I do, I like this joint. I was craving it so baby girl & I enjoyed some corn dogs, fries & a cheese corn dog thing. Service was good & friendly & quick. what more can you expect"}
{"text":"Dollar corn dogs on tuesdays...Score!

Located conveniently in the Fashion Show mall. 

Funnel cake sticks are amazing and only  $2.75."}
{"text":"This place is such an American icon. Coming from Cali I just love this place. It's settled in the best outdoor mall in Vegas,Townsquare mall reminds me of being in SoCal. 
Came here with the family and had to have the corn dog and lemonade. Cherry is my favorite and the kids too. 
They have seating outside the kiosk so it was perfect to grab a quick bite. 
They even brought our food out to us which was a nice touch. Fast friendly service 
I say if you never had the best original American corndog and lemonade you've gotta stop here."}
{"text":"The service is friendly. They over fried all of our items though. Nice to see this old standby in Vegas."}
{"text":"The main reason we seek out Hot Dog on a Stick is for...the lemonade!  It's perfectly sweetened and refreshing on a hot day.  While we tend to go for the regular lemonade, we have also tried the cherry lemonade.  And you know what?  It's all good!  I wish Hot Dog on a Stick was near where I live!  When we head to the Southwest, a trip to Hot Dog on a Stick is a must-do.  

Yes, we've tried the hotdogs and liked them.  However, while good, we don't long for them when we're home.  The lemonade is another story!

The Hot Dog on a Stick in the Fiesta Mall has never disappointed us.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  One time I asked for a small empty cup to pour a little lemonade in it in order to take some medication that has to be added to a small amount of liquid.  The staff gave me a cup without giving me a hard time or charging me any money for it.

In conclusion, if you haven't tried the lemonade, I highly recommend that you do so!"}
{"text":"What hot dog on a stick with a DRIVE THRU! Hell ya I don't have to go to a mall to get a lemonade and a corn dog. 
They guy in the drive was super nice. Offered us a free sample of their new orange lemonade. I ended up ordering one of those too. It was quite tasty! 
It's a very tight turn though so watch out big trucks.
They have a punch card to earn free stuff too. You get one punch per item you buy. Double punches on Mondays & Wednesdays."}
{"text":"I think it's neat that they have this location.

Went to the drive thru today and they have the traditional menu but maybe even a bit more. The prices are the same as I remember. The food is also the same. It's good! The girl at the window was nice. The knew the menu well and knew the combos well. 

I get the three lemonade flavors mixed btw. try it!

I'm not giving it 5 stars because they aren't the best corn dogs. They aren't a 5 star corn dog. They are good, very good, but yea.. Not like a fair..

My one complaint is that the drive thru was a bit dirty.

The corn dogs take the same \"about three minutes\" as the locations in malls."}
{"text":"The workers at this location are the best !  They deserve a raise.  This is the best HDOS location in Las Vegas.  They have quiet indoor seating.  the place is clean and the service is always quick.  They have a bigger selection including Gulden's brown mustard,  Sriracha ketchup, breakfast sausage on a stick with syrup, chili cheese fries...  On top of that not only is there no need to walk through a mall, they also have the friendliest drive through service in town.  Located centrally on Charleston about one short block west of Decatur and there's a light for convenient exiting of the parking lot.   When I want a corn dog fix this is the only place I go because these are not the frozen awful ones.  These are batter dipped and cooked fresh."}
{"text":"It's not corn dog, it's hot dog on a stick! In a search for something different, I stumbled across hot dog on a stick in the Excalibur food court. While it looked like a novelty/carnival setup, the actual taste is actually pretty darn decent. It is quite expensive for what they are, but you'd come to appreciate them making it on the spot, rather than warm them up in a microwave.

Give it a shot if you're looking for something different in Vegas!"}
{"text":"So yummy but they need sodas bc not everyone wants lemonade."}
{"text":"I'd like a corn dog with a side of hearing loss please.

I came to this Hot Dog On A Stick for the first time today.  It was about 11:40 AM and there was nobody inside.  The drive-thru seemed to be a little more busy.  There was only one lady working here today and she was focused on the drive-thru people.  Poor girl was working the drive-thru, the front counter and the fryer.  Things were backing up.  She had to apologize to everybody for the wait.  She acknowledged me a few times while I waited for her to bring the car line down a bit.  I give her credit for that.

The worst part of what seemed to be a very long wait was the alarm that was going off the entire time.  I know exactly where it was but I cannot say for sure what it was.  It was a device in the ceiling that reminded me of a dying battery in a smoke alarm at home.  But this beeping was not in any sort of sequence which made it all the more irritating.  It was so random.  I could not wait to get out of there.  With my food of course.

I ordered two corn dogs, two fries and a lemonade (not all for me).  This came to over $12.  That is steep considering I can go to any Rebel Gas Station around town and get twow corn dogs for $1.  And I wasn't really even that thrilled with the dog.  The batter was too cakey for me.  The fries were good.  I like that they use seasoned salt rather than the standard table salt.  I wish they hadn't used so much of it though.  The lemonade was really good.  I like the hand churrned stuff.  That was probably the best part of lunch."}
{"text":"This place is filthy. Ketchup dispenser is so nasty it clogged when I was trying to get some. Bathroom trash can is over flowing. Tables and floor have crumbs everywhere. Windows are poorly cleaned. Two associates and it took two minutes to be serviced with no other customers inside. Food tray wasn't cleaned before my food was served to me. Empty boxes all over the kitchen floor. Nuff said. Smh!"}
{"text":"This location has the worst customer service. The staff is miserable and they don't really listen to what you want. I've been here twice and both times they get my order wrong and they don't care. I'm sooo bummed that the location on Warm Springs closed :/"}
{"text":"I am so sad to see this location has closed. 

Food and drinks were good. I have never seen a standalone HDOAS location before this, they seem to always be in malls. 

You'll be missed!"}
{"text":"Did you grow up in So Cal like I did!?Then you KNOW what I'm talking about. This little gem of a Hot Dog place was in about every mall there was...Just about the best damn corn dog you ever had. 
But they call it \"Hot Dog on a Stick\" obviously, but,  you say potato....
It is 250 calories... It is a Turkey Link, dipped in batter, deep fried to a golden, delish goodness.. .It is great. ( Not the healthiest thing you can mow on, obviously, but  hey, at least it's pretty low cal. But not if you eat 3....)
You can also get cheese on a stick, if you prefer. Or even a veggie dog.
The lemonade is pretty good, but the sugar free one, not so much. But what sugar free beverage ever is, really?
The employees are always super nice, and  pretty fast. But keep in mind for the really impatient types, they have to actually DIP the darn thing in and fry it up, and they do it only AFTER you order it. The don't have a bunch of previously fried Hot Dogs on a Stick lying around. Which is great for flavor's sake...but remember  that may take 3 to 5 minutes, so control yourselves, and try to be nice to them, especially when they have a long line.  
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love Hot Dog On A Stick. This was part of my childhood and early adulthood working at malls. They are made to order so you always get a hot and crunchy dog. And the lemonade is made fresh. I was super excited to finally visit because I had been craving this for about a month. The employee was super friendly and even gave me a sample of the frozen lemonade while I waited for my order. I like that they offer the 2 item deal for $6. The hot dog was everything I remembered; crunchy sweet batter with a juicy hot dog inside. The cheese stick I ordered was such a disappointment though. Two bites in, the cheese was not even melted all the way through. It was basically a warm cheese stick. I remember when I was younger, I had to wait to eat these because the cheese would burn my mouth. I was really sad because I was looking forward to this cheese stick. And when you are pregnant, and a craving isn't fulfilled, you are left highly upset. Hopefully this was just a one off. I'll still be back when I'm in Town Square to order another hot dog and lemonade."}
{"text":"This is like a childhood favorite. Love that they have turkey corn dogs and that you no longer have to go to the mall to get them. The girls that work there have really good customer service or friendly and polite"}
{"text":"I have loved their cherry & lime lemonade foreeeeever!! But this location is by far the worst. Seems like they hate their jobs so much. The service I received was 5 stars pure of attitude. Apparently, they never heard of the cherry & lime lemonade..... also gave me dirty looks, rolling their eyes  repeating my order to a coworker then makes my drink wrong. Ummm yeah, no. Good thing I don't live in the area, never coming back."}
{"text":"This was my first encounter with the Hot Dog on a Stick. A co-worker and I decided that today (every Tuesday is $1 hot dog day) is the day we would go. Unfortunately, the Veggie Hot Dog is not a part of the $1/dog promo, but I thought it was still worth it. For a Veggie HDOS, plus large lemonade and fries, it was about $9. I thought this was a bit pricey, but being it was my first time, I was okay with paying it. The veggie dog was good. First veggie dog I've ever eaten. The flavor was similar to a regular hot dog, and the texture was actually pretty firm. The lemonade was freaking amazing, maybe the best I've had that I didn't make myself, and the fries were pretty decent. My co-worker had 3 regular HDOS. He said they were very good, though his stomach hurt a bit after devouring them. 
The batter is not corn dog batter, so don't just expect a regular corndog. The batter has a different flavor, and is pretty decent. 

I am sure that the veggie HDOS contains milk or casein and they are fried in the same oil as the meat dogs, so they are definitely not Vegan."}
{"text":"One of my all-time favorite places to eat in the mall.

From the teenage girls in quirkly yellow,red & blue striped uniforms to the fresh lemonade(cherry,apple or lemonade) to the corn or cheese dogs. I just love it.

Good stuff....

PLUS its Cheap Fast & always good.

NEW  they now offer FUNNEL CAKE STICKS with Chocloate syrup OR Raspberry Syrup  & powdered sugar !!

Sooooooooo  Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Hot dog on a stick will basically always be...hot dog on a stick. But this location specifically is constantly closing before it's posted time on yelp AND the building - 9PM. It's pretty bothersome."}
{"text":"Located on Charleston and Decatur. Drive thru! 

Lemonade heaven! Since its summer and the weather is hot in Vegas this is my spot to go to for a frozen lemonade! Hits the spot every time. 

Oh and I'm a cheese lover also so I won't hesitate to order a pepper jack cheese stick or the cheddar ones. 

Yummy. 

Customer service is always on point."}
{"text":"I went to the one in Henderson, located at the corner of Warm Springs and Valle Verde, because they have a drive thru and that's very convenient for me. Pricing is not bad for a corn dog, French fries and lemonade. Best part is that you can order the drink twice as large for an additional 50 cents. Perfect for our Las Vegas summer heat. It's a bit of a wait as they cook the corn dog and French fries so you always get freshly cooked food. The people who works there are very jolly, just like their uniforms. Will go there again during my cheat-days or when I'm craving for corn dog."}
{"text":"We had a coupon for a buy one item and regular lemonade, get one item free. So, we got a regular cherry lemonade and two pepperjack cheese dogs. 
I've had both before, and you can't go wrong. This location was no exception. The girl working behind the counter was very sweet and friendly. She took our name when we ordered, and it wasn't too long before she called it out telling us our food was ready. 
Overall, a great experience!"}
{"text":"I came at 840 pm on a Monday night and the employee working there said they were closed!  I was sad because I wanted my cherry lemonade, fries, and American cheese On a stick! I bet this location is not hitting sales because they close early!"}
{"text":"I was stoked that they offer two vegetarian options, veggie corndog and a cheese stick on a stick. It was pretty good for fast food, and would eat here again."}
{"text":"HDOS drive thru is an amazing concept and I'm glad I live close to this one! Seth served me last week and I got to say I was blown away by his customer service- he offered me a sample of chili when I was wondering about it and he was very friendly to talk to during the wait for my order. 

Perfectly place when you're craving a corn dog/funnel fries/ some lemonade!"}
{"text":"Where do i start! My fave place to go in the mall when shopping and i want a quick bite. Awesome, tasty lemonade amd ono corndogs! The funnel cake sticks are not the greatest, especially if you wanna compare it to Knotts Berry Farm fries are just okay as well.

The only thing is you have to wait for the corndogs to be made becuase they are made to order! But hey i rather waot then have those type of foods sitting under a warmer. 

Hot dog on a stick also has an online site where you can sign up for rewards for being a frequent customer and a mobile app also. I love rewards programs! 

The staff for the most part are pretty friendly but some are not so happy or friendly. Maybe its those hideous uniforms  and hats they have to endure wearing."}
{"text":"we were shopping and decided to have hot dog on a stick with a lemonade! oh boy we are happy we did :) the girl at the register was super sweet and gave us a sample. once we got our food it was super yummy! we got a corn dog each and a large lemonade to share  and we only paid $10 , its a great deal for a snack on the go while shopping around. i recommend it and we will be back for more ;) 

one of the best locations ive been to i would give them a 10 if possible hahaha"}
{"text":"I LOVE HDOS!! BUT they changed the veggie dog and its horrible! I called to ask if it's my imagination that this dog is different and as suspected they changed it. ONE star for the veggie dog and FIVE for everything else!"}
{"text":"Hello, my name is Victor, and I am an addict. That addiction is called Hot Dog on a Stick. And, you know what? I don't have a problem with that. 

There are few things in life as simply delicious as HDOS. I mean, all it is is a super delicious corndog, fries, fresh lemonade. There's no culinary fusion magic or haute cuisine deals going on here. Why? Because who needs that when you're in a rush and the food is this good!

Every time I come here, I find that I'm at war with myself: part of me wants to be smart and just get one hot dog, and part of me doesn't care and wants one hot + cheese on a stick + large lemonade. The latter choice usually wins out. How can it not?!

I'd like to go into detail here about one of my favorite culinary creations: Pepper Jack on a stick. It's the most brilliant idea since the taco, as far as I'm concerned. What they do is take a pepper jack block, dip it in batter, then fry that joker. What you get is a delicious, hot, crispy outer layer of batter and a delicious, hot, melty core of pepper jack. I don't even know the words to describe how good it is. 

As a sidebar, I'd like to say that this place has the cutest girls working behind the counter. Another reason to love this place!"}
{"text":"First of all, I should tell you I have a serious addiction to HDoaS. I love all their food and drink, and I do not think I've ever had a service issue to complain about. So, this review is going to be all positives. Pretty much you're going to read this for my recommendations!

I always get the same three things here: the beef hot dog and the pepper jack on a stick and a regular lemonade. They're the best things on the menu, I believe, and really the best way to introduce people to HDoaS. See, it's the simple stuff here that delivers. The hot dogs are quality Nathan's (I think) so you're not getting value-brand stuff. It shows when you bite into a hot dog -- the meat is still fairly moist and flavorful, and you can tell it's legit comfort food. The cheese, too, is perfect. It comes out super hot and gooey, and you need to take your time getting to it. There's actually somewhat of a science to this: you can't get to it too quickly or it'll be too hot, and you can't wait too long or it'll be too cool. You really have to Goldilocks it, and my informal scientific study reveals the magic wait time to be around 45 seconds from presentation to consumption. Results may vary, so have the lemonade available for when you burn your mouth. Having said that, I accompany my foodstuffs with lemonade. I don't go for the different flavors they offer (lime, cherry, frozen) because I think the original is perfect. It ain't broke, don't fix it...

As mentioned before, they make the food to order. That means your order could take about two minutes, so don't be upset. It's worth it. Also, just so you know, this place is not a budget eatery like Taco Bell. If you wanna eat a ton for $5, this place isn't your best bet. I spent $18 today on two combo meals plus a cheese. Totally worth it, though. 

This particular location has a more expansive menu featuring chicken and other stuff. I've never ventured outside my comfort zone with their food, so I cannot report on their worth. Probably also really good, though."}
{"text":"Came back to redeem my coupons! The service is always great when I come here. They are always very helpful in explaining their menu and are very quick at making my order. Everything is made to order so your food will be hot and fresh. Their menu changing so there aren't any more meals except one (which I think is worth it). It's also nice having a Hot Dog on a Stick that isn't in a mall!"}
{"text":"Can't say I've ever been a fan of Hot Dog on a Stick. I wasn't ever really into corn dogs. So this chain has never been on my list.

But they do make a tasty limeade.

Until I heard about this Hot Dog on a Stick outside of a mall, I was mostly oblivious to the notion that Hot Dog on a Stick pretty much only existed inside mall food courts. So to now have a location not only outside a mall, but with a drive-thru? It's like a Hot Dog on a Stick fan's wildest dream come true.

Anyway, if you're familiar with their product, it's the same stuff. When I went through their drive-thru, I guess it took a long time to get my food because they gave me some free fries for the wait. That was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"It's a hot dog ... on a steeek!  Of *course* it tastes better!  It's on a stick!

In terms of food court choices, this place is pretty darn good.  Their lemonade is absolutely perfect, and the corn dogs are exactly what you can expect with a corn dog.

Of course every time I come here, I picture Ashley from Fresh Prince of Bel Aire in her ridiculous uniform.  Chuuuuurn, baby churn!  Yup, that's why I'm smiling when I am standing in line!  Well, it's that and the lemonade.  Yes, that's darn good lemonade!"}
{"text":"I grew up in the Midwest so my malls didn't have Hot Dog on a Stick and I was missing out. The French fries are seriously the BEST. The seasoning salt is simply delicious. Not to mention the portions are huge. Sure the prices are mall food prices but I would choose these fries over anywhere else, especially nasty McDonald's. The lemonade is also very delicious and the employees offer samples every time I go.  The frozen is my favorite. My only complaint is that blue raspberry lemonade was discontinued :( so sad. Everything is made fresh right behind the counter so you can see it, you know it's gonna be good. The employee Noelle was by herself and she handled everything very well, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Hot Dog on a Stick is awesome!  I love the drive thru concept so I don't have to go to a mall to get my lemonade!  The french fries are one of my favorites out of all restaurants and their portions are HUGE!  The seasoning salt they use is very tasty!  If you haven't tried their frozen grape lemonade ask for a free sample - you won't be disappointed! Their customer service is always great at the Charleston location and the food comes out quick and it is made fresh when you order!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff and delicious lemonade, corn dogs, funnel sticks, and cheese dogs! They greeted me right away and got my order in right away. I definitely will be going back to the Town Square location!!"}
{"text":"Finally, a location not in a mall and able to get the food without dealing with huge parking lots and walking to a food court.  This location has a drive thru!  Service was friendly and quick enough.   Fries are also available and are part of combo meals."}
{"text":"Bad Dog!!!

What's worse than  \"cold\" hot dog on a stick?? A cold cheese dog!! 

I availed my free anniversary treat today only to bite into a cold cheese stick while walking through the parking lot. Of course I didn't go back inside but I should have. The gentleman at the counter timing and temperature was way off today."}
{"text":"Great food! #MustTry Cheese on a stick, Veggie Dog on a stick, Cherry Lemonade & fries Excellent service and very upbeat staff! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality! The hot dogs are fresh, dipped in batter right in front of you, and cooked to order. The lemonade is made from fresh lemons. The freshest preparation you can get in hot dogs. I'm definitely going back again."}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Iced or blended lemonades and grilled cheese corn dog just cheese. And they have beef and turkey"}
{"text":"We asked the guy \"Is there dairy in your batter?\" Three times. Each time he told us NO. We explained we have a baby with allergies, NO it's safe.
Great, 3 hours later we have a sick baby. Googled the recipe. Bingo.
I'm considering calling corporate to complain, but this was quite a while ago and I'm just catching up on reviews now."}
{"text":"I haven't been in a long time until last week. The hot dogs, lemonade were really good. I did however think they were over priced."}
{"text":"The Las Vegas locations I've visited have veggie dogs on a stick while neither of the Hawaii locations do.  *sigh*  If I want to pretend to eat healthy dogs on a stick, I have to go to the mainland.

Anyway, all of the hot dog on a stick locations I've been to have had two things in common.  The food is very consistent and served piping hot.  And the service is always fast and very friendly.  

If you're staying across the street at Sunset Station and just can't do another of their buffets, a hot dog on a stick with a freshly squeezed lemonade makes a great and light alternative."}
{"text":"Best corn dogs I've ever tried. Crispy and fresh :) 
And I love their limeade too!
I recommend it as a snack."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I never eat the food here because I know it's just okay. I don't really crave hot dogs! (But sometimes the funnel cake when I have a sweet tooth!!) 

The ONLY thing I buy from here is LEMONADE. Ohhhh..lemonade. It makes me thirsty just thinking about it! It comes in three flavors: regular, lime, and cherry. I don't get frozen because it doesn't give me a full blast of the flavor! Every. Single. Time. I get food from another restaurant in the mall, I will never order a drink. I always buy lemonade from Hot Dog on a Stick, because it's so tasty and sweet! It just makes you feel good and satisfied on the inside :) 

My favorite flavors are lime and cherry! The taste can be a bit sweet if you're not really into sugary drinks. And it is a bit expensive, but I feel like its worth it when you're washing down whatever food you ordered in the mall!

Also, I suggest not to sit near Hot Dog on a Stick while you're eating because when the workers are smashing lemons from time to time, it's a really off-putting sound! It actually scared me at first haha!"}
{"text":"Only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is because the food itself was fine. However, clearly management should be a little more picky with who they hire. The girl was clearly very distracted by a guy and too busy flirting to pay attention to our order. I order a cherry lemonade and she gave me regular. I ordered a small drink and she charged me for a medium. If you're going to work, pls do your job properly. Thanks."}
{"text":"I got the hot dog on a stick and it was great!!!! The service was great and I will go back again.. The flavor in the batter was amazing"}
{"text":"Not like it used to be. Maybe the psychological effects of being in the mall made it better when I was younger. Either that or the quality just isn't the same...like most things. I need a nap now."}
{"text":"This place recently open and it's just like any other HDOS place. Employees are friendly. Will start small talk while corn dog is being fried. They serve you with a smile. I like their lemonades, there are three different flavors to choose from. To me it seems that the corn dogs there are quite small compared to other HDOS places I've been to, and the price for it doesn't sit well with me.

Be wary of  people on disability scooters, they will run you over and not give a F***.

1 star for the place & 3 stars for the service."}
{"text":"Decent corn dogs - they make them right in front of you too (which can take awhile). I had to pop down to the Orange Julius to get a Coke (they only have lemonade here). I abhor mall food in general, but this is passable for a quick cheap bite."}
{"text":"Hot Dog on a Stick, my jam when I cruise the mall.

What's not to love, freshly battered and fried hot dogs, turkey dogs, and cheese on a stick. They are heaven. They also serve up the best freaking lemonade I've ever had in my life. Shout out to Cherry Lemonade, I love you.

This location also offers fries, chilli cheese fries, and just plain ol' chilli. On my visit, I got a turkey dog and pepper jack cheese on a mother freakin' stick. Just as awesome as it is at the mall without all the teenagers behaving like teenagers.

Service was quick and friendly. The store was super clean. 

This location has a drive-thru and a frequent lemonade card. Buy 12, get your 13th free."}
{"text":"How can you not love Hot Dog on a Stick? 

From the killer uniforms, fresh squeezed (in the barrel with the plunger stick) lemonade/limeade/cherry limeade to the cheese on a stick, what's there not to like?

I'm a major cheese freak, with some of my favorites being Brillat Savarin, Haystack Peak, Humboldt Fog goat cheese, 5 year aged Gouda, Parmigiano-Reggiano but that doesn't mean that I can't still dig good ole American cheese. Major comfort food for me. And a stick of American cheese battered with corndog batter goodness & deep fried until it's all gooey inside? Come on... You can also get it with pepper jack but that just doesn't do it.

So every time I find myself in a food court with a Hot Dog on a Stick, I must succumb to a fresh squeezed limeade and a cheese on a stick (American of course).

Life is good."}
{"text":"This place would have easily got a higher score had the service been great. Everyone likes hot dog on a stick! It's quick, it's convenient and the pepper jack corn dog is delicious. So walking  up to the counter,  I see the sign where it says if you get their app and sign in you get 2.00 off your purchase. Which is a great deal.  I got the app downloaded it and asked the lady where to find the coupon and she just threw her hands up in the air and said \"idk\" I the. Asked her if she knew anything about the app. She rolled her eyes and said \"I have a line step to the side so I can help the others and until you find your coupon. \" at this point I'm a little confused as to why she was giving me attitude, but I stepped to the side and did as I was told anyways. Long story short she tells me my food is ready while she's helping other people and I couldn't even find the coupon so I gave up. She took my money and then said \"your food is to the right\" just a completely rude lady but idk maybe she was having a bad day and I caught her at the wrong time lol. Over all the food was good but the service was awful. Will I be coming back? Probably yes but I'll probably never try their app again or ask them to help me with it."}
{"text":"Hot dog on a stick is preferred over hot dogs any day. I love corn dogs and their friends are delicious as well. If you ever don't know what to eat i suggest choosing that"}
{"text":"This Hot Dog On A Stick is located inside Boulevard Mall across from Zumiez and next to Red Mango and Auntie Anne's. Would rather choose from one of these places to eat than the ones in the Food Court (besides Cinnabon of course). 

The worker that helped me was really nice and worked quickly to get my order done. 

P.S. Their fries are really really good! They're always fresh, with the right type of crunch."}
{"text":"I love cheese on a stick because it reminds me of my younger days at amusement parks. You could never find them anywhere else! Well, now I can, at a mall near me. 

I have gotten the American cheese kind, as well as tried the hot dogs. I'm not a fan of the hot dog, really, but the cheese one is good as long as its straight out of the fryer. Any later and its soft and icky. I like the lemonades- perfect when it's hotter than Hades outside."}
{"text":"This review is for the sugar-free lemonade only.  I'm not a fan of anything else there, as they use (just in my opinion) inferior quality hot dogs at an enormously expensive price.  You can go to Chicago Tasty Dog for a really good quality all beef corn dog plus fries for much less than the same here.

Hot Dog on a Stick is the only place I have been to that actually serves sugar-free lemonade.  I have been getting it for years (not only in this location), and it is massively overpriced at $5 or so for a large.  However, with soda and everything else being pretty unhealthy, this is a great alternative for those like me that shouldn't really have sugar in their diet.

I do have to complain that they used to make it fresh when you ordered it, and you could choose the sweetener you wanted and how much to put in.  Last time I went however, they had it ready made pre-sweetened with Splenda only, and a little too much of it.  I don't know if the other locations do this as well in the area."}
{"text":"Let me just start with the fact that there's never anyone present at the front whenever I come here. The person just randomly comes from the back and doesn't greet you. The first time my corn dog was not cooked all the way meat was cold and the dough was still gooey! This second time the food was actually good but as soon as I got my food the guy working went straight to the back and then later came out to cook his food and missed about 4 customers in between time. Where is the customer service?? Who is the manager lol smh. Don't expect to get anything fast at this location. 

Photo attached of guests waiting for at least 5min before the same guy came from the back."}
{"text":"For your typical fried-food fare this place is pretty good. My kids constantly ask for either the hot dogs or cheese on a stick every time we are near the mall. The plus side is that it's not as messy as some of the other options, but the downside is that everything is deep-fried.

While you won't find gourmet food here, you will find traditional circus food. Corn dogs, cheese on a stick, fries, and several different flavors of lemonade. Compared to some other places, Hot Dog on a Stick is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Eh, it was ok, but I have definitely had better.

We were on this side of town and super excited to see this place. My teen is a huge corn dog lover and we have gotten these at the mall a bunch of times. Not sure if this is just something you have to eat as soon as you get it, but we did the drive through and drove 20 minutes home and by that time they were pretty meh :-( 

Corn dog loving teen ate 1/2 of 1 of the 2 she got and was done. I got the new mini corn dog bites and ate them in the car and they were pretty bad even being piping hot. The tiny hot dogs were tough and when you tried to bite it in half, the whole thing came out leaving the corn dog shell. 

We got two combo meals, an extra turkey dog on a stick (cheapest option) and the mini bites and it was $26 something. Seemed very over-priced to me. Combo meals are $7-$8 each, so for a family of 4 you are easily over $30. 

Price wouldn't have been so terrible if it had been decent, but it wasn't. I think we just like the ones at the malls better. To leave this on a better note, I will say that the employees were very friendly, so that's always nice :-)"}
{"text":"Visited on Saturday 10/01/2016 at 8PM.  $10.12 got me a corn dog, a cheese dog, an order of fries, and a lemonade.  

The poor gal working was all alone but despite being short-handed she was still so friendly and she was handling those orders LIKE A BOSS.  I was really impressed with her multi-tasking skills...I'd watch her take an order, then go check and begin foods, then come back and take an order, etc.  That woman needs a raise. I'm sure the employees hate it but I love their little primary-colored uniforms and especially the hat.  

Everything I had to eat was hot and fresh.  The fries were crispy and had a nice seasoning salt on them.  I would compare the fries to McDonald's in shape but much crispier. 

Their lemonade is amazing.  You can get it in different flavors but my favorite is the classic original.  It is not too sweet but tart and always ice cold.  I never get heartburn from it which is unusual for me but I think it's because it's so fresh.  

My favorite thing here is the cheese on a stick...and yes it's as white trashy and fattening as it sounds.   You can choose American cheese, spicy pepper jack cheese, or mozzarella cheese.  My favorite is the American cheese version because it tastes exactly like a grilled cheese but it's on a stick and deep fried....you can't go wrong with that.  The outside is like a regular corn dog but the inside has gooey melty cheese.  I feel very aroused just thinking about it again.  For my next wedding anniversary I'm requesting a bouquet of cheese on a sticks instead of flowers.  

If you find yourself in the mall and you DGAF about your waistline like me then you gotta hit this place up."}
{"text":"I know it's fast food.
I know it's a chain and their food is the same in every location.
That being said, their fried pepperjack cheese on a stick is TO DIE FOR! 
This one is in a food court and I had to order just one and enjoy it right there. YUM!"}
{"text":"Normally very awesome I love the food! My kids love it no problem with the company. Tonight I had to make a brief trip to the mall a little hungry, 30 min till close my bad I know the employees want to go home I get that but still Genesis was pretty rude, she rolled her eyes took those deep annoyed breaths, almost cried it's not like I meant to come in 30 min before close.  Either way will avoid eating at this location if she's here,


Since she was in a rush the food was a little burnt"}
{"text":"Stopped by here today during our volleyball tournament and Ricky was just great! Very polite, efficient and was working alone.  Our food tasted great, he brought our food to our table and also cleared our trays when we were finished.  It was clean too! I will visit here again! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I don't have to go to the mall to eat here anymore. My food was good as usual. Clean and friendly staff :)"}
{"text":"This has been my best hot dog on a stick experience ever. I was having a hard time picking a flavor so after having them give me samples of all of them I stuck with the original. They were very patient and friendly. I do own a business so I did pay attention to the staff names. MEGAN and JOHN were the best they made my experience just as when I use to go and I was a kid. My dad would be so proud to come to this location he was actually friends with Dave."}
{"text":"Hot Dog on a Stick! If you come here, you must always leave with two things: a Hot Dog on a Stick and a Giant Lemonade! No reason not too! I tried Popeyes for the first time which is located next to this place and it was plain and boring. This place always does the trick and the workers did their job and nothing special stood out. Aside from the short lines that were present. I easily would choose to eat this in San Francisco and would eat it in any other town."}
{"text":"I don't know why I was so disappointed here. I love corn dogs. I similarly love deep fried corn dogs. When I woke up craving a corn dog I headed down to visit the GF and cheat on her by going to the competition. 

There was one girl working and she was taking one order, collecting the money washing her hands and then cooking the order and repeating. I was 4 orders deep and had to wait at least 10 mins if not closer to 15 mins to place my order. How hard would it have been to take two or more orders, cash them out wash your hands and then prep and serve the orders? Would have cut my time in half and made my experience much better. 

Once received the corn dogs were a little over cooked to my liking and the breading was very thin. Not sure how they make the thick breading at the fairs I go to but I'd recommend they learn, its half the fun of eating a corn dog. The cornmeal!

 The flavor was good and most likely the only redeeming quality of my trip here...that and the fact they are now selling all beef hotdogs; did make me wonder and worry what they were using previously.

 I'd give them another try the next time I'm craving a corndog but not if there is a line and only one person working."}
{"text":"According to the Yelp rating, 4 stars means your a fan of this place and I am a huge fan of these simple yet delicious hotdogs and cheeses on a stick. I don't know what it is about this place as it is grossly overpriced for what I get but I keep coming back each time I am in the mall just to have one. Plus their lemonade is awesome to! Maybe it's those silly uniforms I am attracted to? Who knows. They have been in business for so many years now, I can't be the only one with an addiction to this place."}
{"text":"Not going to lie but I am a huge fan of this place. They have a simple menu that consists of fried stuff and lemonade. What more can you ask for in life? My personal favorite, hands down, is the pepper jack cheese on a stick. 

My only knock against this place and every other hot dog on a stick is that its pricey... I mean for petes sake, $3 for a corn dog is a little much for me outside of the a baseball game or county fair. Granted... I will not let it slow me down. :)"}
{"text":"SO HAPPY that this gift from god is now even closer to my house than the Galleria location!! 

My first and only visit (so far) was through the drive-thru. The staff was super friendly and I didn't wait too long for my order. 

Their hotdogs are on point!!

I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I can't believe there's a hot dog on a stick that's not in a mall. I was just driving by and really needed a place to go to the restroom before my CPR class and BAM! Hot Dog On A Stick definitely caught my eye. There were two people working and another family inside. The drive thru was busy so I had to wait, and so I decided to use the restroom to waste some time. I came back and she was ready for me, perfect timing! Their menu is small but very much worth the price. I got the meal with one stick, fries, and a drink. I chose an american cheese on a stick...my favorite! I was so tempted to get the meal that had two sticks because of course I wanted a hot dog, but I was in a hurry so I couldn't really enjoy my food as much as I really wanted to. I got the cherry lemonade, my faaaaaave. I want to just go there and buy that all on its own. They have a yelp check in discount, BONUS! And really friendly service. Though it might take a minute, it's definitely worth the tiny wait! :) Hot Dog Heaven!"}
{"text":"I love cheese on a stick and I was so craving one but I didn't want to go to the mall to get one so, my daughter said that there was a place on Charleston near her college and so I went to check it out and the service is great and of course love my pepper jack cheese on a stick I sure glad I don't live anywhere close by or else I would be here every other day and that would mean trouble lol and hitting the gym.  This place is pretty big and just like the mall great lemonade and sticks.  Check them out they even have Nathan's hot dogs now so if you like hot dogs this is a great inexpensive place to eat .  

Happy eating  xoxoxo"}
