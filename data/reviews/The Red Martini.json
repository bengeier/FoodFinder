{"text":"This was easily the worst dining experience I have ever had.
I reserved for four people on the Saturday before Mother's day at 7pm. When we arrived we were placed in the bar, with music so loud it made conversation virtually impossible. I asked the hostess about seating in the restaurant as I had reserved and she said it was full. She offered to move us to another table in the bar, ut it was closer to the live music and would have been even noisier.
We ordered some drinks and I was confronted with a bottle of beer, with no glass. There was nothing fine dining about the atmosphere or he service. It was a bar room experience at fine dining prices.
The food was the only thing left to rescue the evening and it was a disaster. I ordered the pork tenderloin which was so overcooked that I thought they has served a pork chop with the bone in. It was also flavorless and burnt. My dining companions also expressed great disappointment with their meals, using terms like flavorless, over-cooked and cold.
We quickly paid the bill and left to seek a more appropriate venue for dessert and coffee. By this time even Tim Horton's seemed appealing.
Avoid this restaurant. The only thing that is fine dining is the pricing."}
{"text":"I was definitely seeing a lot of red at the Red Martini!  I usually have a 3 strikes and you're out policy... If this were a baseball game, the Red Martini's winning streak would be in the negatives!

It was my high school English teacher's birthday and because she lives I'm the Durham Region we usually dine somewhere in Pickering or Ajax. It gets me out of Toronto once in awhile.  So I had made reservations for 7pm. When we arrived there were 2 occupied tables in the downstairs bar lounge.  We stood there for 5 minutes with no sign of any hostess or staff.  After what seemed like an eternal wait, the waitress appeared and she told us we could choose a table either upstairs or downstairs.  We opted for the upper level.

The Red Martini is a house-converted restaurant, similar to 22 Church Street Bistro across the street.  A co-worker told me that the 2 restaurant are owned by the same owner, however this is unconfirmed.  However I did spot a lot of similarities.

Once we chose our table, again we were left unattended and ignored for awhile. We quickly realized that the waitress who \"greeted\" us downstairs was the only staff in the front end for the entire restaurant. Strike 1 - understaffed.

My high school English teacher loves her white wine and she usually orders the house white.  Strike 2 - they were out of their house white.  This is a clear indication of poor restaurant management.  So we had no other choice than to order the next available white wine which was twice the cost.

We waited for our appetizer - no bread basket appeared - Strike 3 and you're out! 

We ordered and shared the Stuffed Portobello Mushroom Salad to start. This could've easily been THE best tasting salad I've ever had in my life. However, the minor neglect in detail made it second best.  The salad was a deconstructed-style salad. The grilled portobello mushrooms were delicious. The \"stuffing\" was made from imitation crab meat and eggs... So essentially it tasted like an egg salad.  It was also served with COLD naan bread... It would've been the perfect salad if they grilled the naan. We had requested that the appetizer come first and then our mains... However the server showed up 2 minutes into us digging into our salads, so we had to send her back to the kitchen and requested the food be kept warm.

My Coconut Tilapia was served with a spicy plum sauce, Bok Choy, red and yellow bell peppers and jasmine rice. When I first bit into the tilapia I was excited that the fish skin was so crisp... But I quickly realized that the crisp was not due to skillful culinary execution, but rather to a burnt fish... Parts of it were so burnt I started tasting charcoal!  Also, the \"coconut\" component of the dish was M.I.A.  This dish had so much potential.. *sigh*

I didn't try my teacher's Veggie Stir-Fry with Chicken but the feedback I got from her wad that the vegetables were cooked to a mush, and that the chicken was dry.  In their defense, the mush factor may have been a result of the dish being kept on a warming plate.

To finish we ordered a cappuccino, tea and marbled cheesecake.  The server came back up to inform me that they don't offer cappuccino... How do you not know that?  Its like she was a temp hired to tide over a quiet Sunday restaurant service.  So I settled for a coffee.  

The cheesecake was average, nothing spectacular.  

At the end of the day, the bill came to $105.  I will say that the portion sizes are generous and the food does have potential... However, the service aspect is going to need a complete facelift.  I had such high hopes for you Red Martini... I thought you'd be sizzling... But unfortunately the only thing that was red and sizzling about my experience at the Red Martini was my dress and the afterburn in my mouth from the spicy plum sauce!"}
{"text":"When we arrived it took our waitress considerable time to bring us 2 diet cokes let alone even take our order. She kept walking by us and saying that she would be right with us, however it took her 20 minutes of backing and forthing to actually get to us and the restaurant wasn't even that busy later on a sunday evening. We decided to order calamari with tomato sauce. It was brought out in 35 minutes without tomato sauce. After asking for the tomato sauce, it took another 10 minutes to get it. But I have to say the calamari was probably the only decent thing about this night. We got our food shortly after. I ordered the goat cheese ravioli with smoked salmon. I'm 99% sure that there was little to no goat cheese in my ravioli as it had the taste and texture of ricotta cheese...something you'd pick up frozen at the grocery store. I also had to search for any pieces of smoked salmon as they were miniscule and few and far between. Overall, I've had store bought pasta much better than that. My boyfriend ordered the New York striploin which was supposed to come with tempura onion rings...there were none to be seen. The cut of the steak was completely wrong and the whole middle of the steak was all gristle. He also asked for sauce on the side and his steak was completely coated in it. It was disgusting and I actually felt bad watching him eat it and try to cut the thing. We then sat for 20 minutes waiting for the waitress to clear our plates and give us our bill. She would walk by us continuously and ignore us. We had a coupon for the restaurant which is another reason why we decided to try it, and both waitresses tried to short change us on the value of it, finally after telling them 3 times what needed to be done, they got it right.The service here was atrocious, the food was seriously lacking, especially for the price, the atmosphere was alright however it was freezing because it was cold and drafty.I'd never waste my time going here again and would warn other people about going there. I have no idea how this restaurant is still surviving in today's marketplace."}
