{"text":"This is a great burger and fry trendy-style restaurant.  Both the burgers and fries are delicious.  I just hope that stupid McDonalds they're going to build across the street doesn't ruin their business and/or view out the front windows.

My wife and I went here one night, and it happened to be May 6th.  We both got burgers for only 56 cents each!  I'll be eating here every May 6th as long as they're around."}
{"text":"I had the 'Friend With Benefits' burger with Sweet Potato fries & the fried pickles. The burger was really good and was presented beautifully. It's a nice sized burger, so that alone made me happy. The sweet potato fries were a real treat & the fried pickles were to die for! The included red curry dipping sauce suited it well. The service was fairly fast & pleasant. I had no complaints. I will definitely be coming back to 56 West because their menu is filled with quality ingredients & it sparks interest. The quality of ingredients used is a highlight of 56 West."}
{"text":"Brunch for under $7.56 that includes a buffet with biscuits and chorizo sausage gravy, build your own omelet, strata, pancakes and French toast, assorted breakfast meats and fresh fruit. Keep in mind you are welcome to wear pajamas to brunch! 

I'm a fan of the \"friends with benefits\" burger with sweet potato fries.  They have a pretty tasty dinner entree with a large salmon filet (you may pick your glaze and side options). 

The atmosphere is casual and prices are inexpensive. Staff is usually friendly. It's a smaller space with under 20 tables and there's normally plenty of parking available in the lot behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place!  The food, the service, the atmosphere!  The only thing I don't love is that they don't serve wine, but I understand the whole liquor license thing and they make up for it by having a great beer selection.  Go to this wonderful place and enjoy for yourself!!!"}
{"text":"What I like about this place is the food is  fresh. It's mostly burgers, sandwiches and salads and the flavor combinations are delish. I've been waited on by 3-4 servers at different times and they've all been friendly and attentive. They also try to buy local ingredients and support local orgs like City Fresh, which is a plus."}
{"text":"We went to 56 West last night for the first time, and I have to say that Kevin G.'s review is spot on.  I really liked the interior -- classy, but casual, and the decor was neither overwhelming nor simple.  A perfect reflection of (and complement to) the food.  It was 7:30 on a Sunday night and there weren't many other patrons in the dining room, so we were seated right away.  

Much like my first visit to Sweet Melissa's, I wanted to order everything on the menu.  The dishes had some kinky names (Friends with Benefits, Italian Lover, etc.), but it made ordering fun.  Our waitress was very friendly and answered all my questions honestly.  And her recommendations matched my appetite exactly.  I settled on the Hidden Desire salad (an Asian-inspired dish) and added the sesame-crusted ahi tuna (rare).  The salad was a really nice-sized portion for the money (ended up being $12 once I added the tuna).  I thought the $12 would prove to be expensive at first, expecting a smaller, artfully presented salad with a few well-placed slices of tuna.  But the salad was almost overflowing on my plate and the tuna steak was a really great size, larger than what I've bought for myself at Giant Eagle.  And it was GOOD.

After reading such great things about the burgers, I do sort of regret not getting one.  But that's okay.  We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Well. once again I find myself in the minority when it comes to reviewing a restaurant. Six of us had \"dinner\" here last Friday night. We were seated promptly and our waitress arrived to take drink orders quickly... so far, so good. I ordered a \"thin sliced seared tuna\" sandwich on baguette. The tuna was way too fishy tasting, too well done and very disappointing. Everyone else ordered some variation of burger... all of which arrived well-done despite specific requests ranging from rare to medium. The scowling grumpy guy that skittered around the small dining room turned out to be the owner! Our waitress was clearly embarrassed when I asked who he was. All in all .... a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Yikes.
We heard that this place had a brunch, so we thought we would check it out. 
I'm pretty sure our server was still drunk from the night before, but then again he could have just been drinking on the job -- slurring his words, dressed in sweat pants and a dirty shirt, and I wont even get into his personal grooming issues.
The brunch \"buffet\" was quite minimal and the food was below sub-par.
The only thing that was relatively OKAY about this place was the \"make your own\" omlette bar."}
{"text":"I've eaten at 56 West several times and love their burgers, sandwiches, and Fresh Fries in particular.  Their brunch buffet is also very nice and offers a reasonable selection.

Seating has never been a problem when I've gone there, and the staff is friendly and attentive.  The decor is trendy and moody, and the windows in the front are broad and unobstructed.  Great casual place for family, friends, or a more intimate setting."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on the list from Cleveland Independents, and wasn't disappointed. My friend and I both ordered entrees from the menu (skipping the pajama brunch since this was our first visit.), and thoroughly enjoyed the meal, service, and price.   We will definitely be going back to try other items from the menu."}
{"text":"While the food was pretty great for the price, the service was terrible. The way he handled my gf and me made it seem like he felt he was above us somehow. Maybe it's because we don't dress all posh and hip like a few of the other customers. There is plenty of places to park in the back or nearby. On to the food. Their onion rings were amazing. The \"spicy\" ketchup has no spice to it all, but a nice tang.  Their burgers are a little below average if they came naked, the toppings are what make them delish. 
Overall, even though the food is pretty good, the service is terrible. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Oh my Lord, I cannot say enough good things about this place. Decided to take a chance after seeing lots of other decent reviews here on Yelp, and it did not disappoint. That might be the most fun, original meal that I've had in a month, at hands-down the best price I've paid for one in 6 months. Our waiter was very cheery and helpful (sidenote: the manager seems to be a little overbearing and gruff, but I won't let that affect this great meal). Can't wait to try their Pajama Brunch."}
{"text":"Delicious hamburgers, neat ambiance.  The food definitely tasted fresh, each ingredient was delicious and complimented the entree.  We went for burgers, but the specials that night sounded scrumptious.  Will make a repeat visit to try the other dishes, and maybe try out their Sunday pajama brunch.  Only complaint is we wished they had beers on tap, though they had a decent bottle selection.  There's a parking lot in the back, making parking in Lakewood a cinch."}
{"text":"Took my \"food-snob\" parents here for lunch today and everything was delicious. Their burgers and sandwiches were on yummy bread, and the vegan chili was excellent and so filling! Definitely a Lakewood staple."}
{"text":"This a small hidden place on Detroit ave in Lakewood. The decor is a little \"sharp edges\" but the food...oh well!
My favorite , burger and tapenade. I hear they buy everything fresh and from top suppliers. The bread comes from one of the best bakeries around.
My son loves the sweet potatoe fries."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place when they cook the food thoroughly.  I have been there a few times and ordered sweet potato fries and they are never cooked all the way. I am not sure why? Maybe they make them fresh and don't know how long to cook them? 
The staff is never consistent, I think they have a high turn over rate. However, all of the staff I have encountered has been beyond helpful and sweet as pie. 
I wish they would reform their menu and add some new items to help spice it up a bit."}
{"text":"56 West is great for lunch and dinner, but let me tell you -- their brunch is fantastic!  7.99, all you can eat buffet, including an omelet station.  French toast, pancakes, eggs benedict, fruit salad, etcetera were all top notch, and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"so yummy, so fresh (hence, so yummy).  no freezers = ultra-fresh ingredients.  this joint is all about local and organic produce, all-natural meats, and breads baked daily.  oh, and homemade pickles!  prices are totally reasonable for the quality of food and service received.  one downside -- it would be nice to have draft beer."}
{"text":"Dined there on a recent Friday night. The staff was less than enthused to see us even though there was only one other couple dining there. Service was incredibly slow. We waited ten minutes for a beer and then another ten minutes before our server took our food order. When the food finally arrived, we were surprised at how good it was. It wasn't great, but it was good. 
Ordered take out last night. I wanted one burger medium well but asked if they could make sure it wasn't charred. The guy taking my call assured me it wouldn't be charred. He shared the lack of enthusiasm and warmth that we experienced from the other staff when we dined in but I believed he could get our order right. When we opened our take out, my burger was completely charred. Inedible. I called and was again greeted by the same coldness. He offered to make another and have us come back out but that wasn't going to happen. The staff's attitude is just so indifferent and lackluster I have no desire to give them any more of our money."}
{"text":"I went here for a second time last night with a group of 18.  It's a smaller place so I was worried when I'd called to make a reservation for but they didn't bat an eye, even when I asked for separate checks!  My first time here was back in October and I'd had the veggie burger, Fresh & Pure which was tasty and this time I got Friends With Benefits.  By the way -- LOVE the burger names!  FWB was really good!  Their salad dressing was also great.  My only disappointment was that they only serve beer.  The service was attentive and the prices are really great for such a trendy-looking place.  The biggest surprise was when my huge party was walking out the door.  The manager (may have been the owner?) stopped me and gave me a $10 gift card for bringing in so many people.  It's clear how much customer service means to him and for that alone I will continue to come back over and over again."}
{"text":"A Sunday drive up to Cleveland with plans that got changed helped us end here. If you aren't paying attention it's pretty easy to miss and let me say, that would be said! 

It's a small place with friendly service. The decor is plain but that's fine when you just want to get something in your belly. Also parking seemed easy enough on the street and I do believe there is a lot in the back. 

Since we got there on a Sunday around 1 they were doing their lunch menu and also there brunch buffet. With the sight of eggs benedict on the way to the table I picked the buffet. Not the best idea. Everything on my plate was cold which put a huge damper on that. BUT, everything was still amazing. If it was 10AM and this stuff was warm this would easily be the best brunch buffet I've had. (and i've had them all over the us) 

So, I ended up ordering off the menu and getting a chicken sandwich. AMAZING. M fiances burger was equally amazing.

Great service, really good food and nice comfy atmosphere. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"GROSS!

We went there for brunch and it was AWFUL! 
SERVICE:  VERY SLOW, rude and the overall feeling he couldnt be bothered
PARKING: AMPLE
FOOD:  The brunch buffet was disgusting.  The only thing good was the omelette station.  I had better food when I was in the Marines and we had to eat re-hydrated food the slop cooks would prepare in the middle of the desert.
PRICE: Under $10 but really they should be paying you to eat there.

RECOMMENDATION:  I would rather eat bread and drink water for breakfast.  Please save yourself the time and money."}
{"text":"Lots of great veg options, although vegan, less so.

I loved the fried pickles with red pepper dipping sauce.  Nice and salty and acidic.  The veggie burger was also good, with a great bean flavor mixed with grueyere cheese (the bun was a little on the stale side for me, though).  The potato pancakes with mozzarella were good but a little flavorless, despite the apple chutney.  It needed some sort of sauce on it too.

I didn't care for the onion rings at all.  When I read \"beer battered\" I think lots of batter hugging thick onions.  These were very thinly  sliced onions drizzled in overly greasy, too crispy slivers of batter. Not my kind of onion ring.

The decor is nice, sort of hipster modern.  And the service was very good.  Nice big bathroom too."}
{"text":"This place disappointingly closed. Boo... another one bites the dust... I'm sure something good will take it's place...  

After my initial review I went again and it had gotten worse, so I'm not super surprised. Oh well."}
{"text":"Burgers, burgers, burgers, burgers, burgers...

That's pretty much all I can think of about this place.  It is local, quaint, friendly, but a pretty limited menu.  Some upscale appetizers, salads...and burgers.  I am probably exaggerating but I am just going off my memory here.  The burgers are delicious, though, really tasty and good variety.  I'll keep going back as long as they keep serving up tasty burgers."}
{"text":"Meh really sums it all up. 

My fiance and I stopped in here on a Saturday evening to grab a quick bite to eat. It was very nondescript. We had to get our order takeout because whatever potpourri in there was making me nauseous from allergies and the fiance a headache. So thumbs down there. The food wasn't super fast. 

The food was decent I suppose. The burgers were overcooked (shock of the century as burgers are always overcooked). The salad was fine but then again for the price it should have been. The fries were on the nondescript side. 

I don't think we will be returning anytime soon. If we are going to spend 20 dollars on a couple of hamburgers we would rather go to brown bag burger."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good...cute menu with lots of \"suggestively named\" items.  The Spinach and Artichoke Dip appetizer was delicious.  I got the One Hot Chick Sandwich and my husband had the Superfine burger.  While both tasted good, we both wondered where the sauce was (Red Curry Mayo and Green Goddess dressing) on our sandwiches.  We really couldn't even taste it.

There were 2 couples waiting when we got there and we ended waiting for about 30 minutes at 7pm on a Saturday night.  Two not so good things -- there were empty tables that sat un-bussed for 10+ minutes while people were waiting (BAD!), and the air conditioning could have standed to be turned down a few clicks -- WAAAAY too hot in there.

We were up from the Canton area to see a comedian at The Winchester, so I'm not sure if we'd come here again because it's so far.  Maybe if we're in town again.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"omg - i have never had such bad service in my life.  between the grumpy host and the needy waiter, it was amazing that we even got our food.  i do recommend the fried pickles - very, very good......but i have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant before.  the host looked like he was ready to kill us when we walked in - then motioned for us to sit on the couch while he (i wrongfully assumed) went to clear a table.  meanwhile, several other patrons walked in and were immediately seated by the female server (who appeared to be the only normal person working there).  the male server was so......odd.  everything we asked for (water, ketchup, beer, etc) had to be requested multiple times, however, he seemed to have plenty of time to linger around the table and just stare at us while we ate.  the host just walked around the room giving everyone the stink eye - which is a bit awkward.  the food was okay - i like the menu a lot and i like that fresh, local ingredients are used - but it was hard to even focus on that when you are completely appauled by the service."}
{"text":"I like that their sandwiches come out with a giant knife in them. I have no idea how to explain the feel of this place. Kind of garage meets \"I used to be a mom n pop store\". I expected a better beer menu and the food was a little too cute. The names of entree's were phrases. If you scrape off all the pretense or whatever that \"I'm too cool\" vibe is, you actually have a nice place. The food is really good. There are two areas that they call \"sitting in the window\" (exactly what it means) and quality service. It's worth a stop in."}
{"text":"56 West is a cute, slightly trendy burger joint in Lakewood that would be much better if they'd just learn not to overcook the meat. Both my husband's burger and my ahi were cooked way too long tonight. 

The names of the menu items are more than a little twee, but the combinations are tasty and clever. Our server was friendly and attentive, and the dining room is pleasant and quiet. It's worth noting that they serve only beer, not wine. Though it has some limitations, 56 West is a decent place to grab a sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see that 56 West hasn't received better reviews.  I've been a regular here since it opened, and I have never had a bad experience there.

It's hard to take a simple concept like burgers and salads and make it impressive, but 56 West has given these traditional American staples a new image and feel.  A contemporary, yet intimate atmosphere combined with an innovative, inuendo-laced menu make eating burgers and fries seem like the trendy thing to do.  

When I have a taste for a burger and I want to go somewhere local, I have a few choices.  I can go to 5 Guys Burgers and Fries and read the ultra-positive, self indulgent reviews and newspaper articles they have used as wallpaper while I wait 20 minutes for a greasy burger indistinguishable from the ones they sell at Steak-n-Shake for half the price.  I can also go to 56 West, where they offer creative daily and weekly specials using locally purchased and organic ingredients as well as a menu that features a \"build your own\" concept which ensures that there will always be something new to try.  For $7-10, I would go to 56 West every time!

Some of the reviews have mentioned the owner as coming across as \"grumpy\" or \"odd.\"  The truth is he is an experienced restaurateur who has been in the food game a long time, and he always makes time to stop and chat for a few minutes when I see him.  He once explained that his service philosophy is to treat your customers like friends, and your employees like family.  This helps create a fun, relaxed atmosphere, evidenced by their birthday celebrations for patrons and the pajama brunch.

There are few places where you can get creative, high-concept food for such reasonable prices.  The Pure Pleasure is a unique appetizer, and the Friends with Benefits and Beautiful Sunrise are solid burger choices if you're not in a creative mood or can't decide on one of your own.  The baguette is usually the best bread choice for the sandwiches.  The steak and tuna entrees are good as well, especially with the Caesar salad and Menage-a-Trois potato casserole.

To help ensure quick service and high quality food, try going during off hours.  Like some of the other neighborhood restaurants in Lakewood, they have a small kitchen and the place can get a little cramped at times which might affect your experience.  Regardless of when you go, you can be sure there is nowhere else offering this many options for burgers with this kind of value."}
{"text":"This place was pretty bad from the start.  My companion and I were seated at a table topped with crumbs and stickiness.  When we asked for the table to be wiped down, the guy helping us -- who was evidently the man in charge of the operation -- agreed and did it, but not without an attitude that suggested that we were picky for asking.  (We later noticed that the little plastic advertisement holder on the table was also sticky.  Cleanliness at the tables is apparently not a priority at 56 West.)

This first part of the dining experience accurately foreshadowed the rest.

We were asked whether we would have something to drink.  We were interested in beer, but unsure at first which we'd have (there is a decently-sized list to consider).  We were brushed off briskly, having apparently annoyed our guy with our not knowing immediately which beer we'd have.

Eventually, we had our beers and we were asked whether we wanted an appetizer.  At the first second of hesitation, he snapped that he'd be back!  That made our decision for us.  No appetizer.

Finally, it came time to order.  My companion made a perilous mistake in not knowing immediately and firmly which bread she would have her sandwich on.  Again, we were given attitude.  It is worth remarking at this point that it isn't as if the place was hopping and we were taking an inordinately long amount of time to make decisions.  Business was slow, and our decision-making occurred at a normal rate of speed!

One of us had the Walk on the Beach (a fish-based sandwich), the other the Handsome Fun Guy (a mushroom-based sandwich).  The sandwiches were actually pretty good, though comparable or better sandwiches aren't hard to find in the area.  The sweet potato fries, which were an extra $2.56 as a side, were a real disappointment.  My companion remarked, \"These fries have seen better days.\"  In fact, I think this was literally true.  These fries both tasted and looked like microwaved leftovers.

Throughout the time of our dinner, our server came back several times, but it was one of those times when you wish your server would be less attentive.  Each time, it seemed we were put on the defensive.  He seemed pretty annoyed, for instance, that the place had been open for 4 years and that in that time, we'd not been to it!  Excuse me for not being privy to the gustatory wonders of the Cafe 56 franchise!  

In conclusion, pretty much anything that could be gained from going here you could get elsewhere with a much more pleasant experience.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Really solid, unpretentious place to grab a burger. And it's pretty inexpensive, too -- I mean, for a great burger and sweet potato fries, you pay about as much as you would for Chipotle. Definitely one of the best burgers I've had in Lakewood. I went there for an early lunch, so it was pretty empty -- meaning the service was pretty instantaneous and nice. I totally look forward to going back here and trying the dozen or so specialty burgers they have. I got the Friends With Benefits, with bacon, Havarti and fried onions. Hmm...I'm trying to think of something smart-ass or funny with which to top this review off, but I'm coming up blank. Sorry, y'all."}
{"text":"Good things about the \"Pajama Brunch\" at 56 West:
- our wait wasn't ridiculous - about 20 minutes for a group of 5 at 12:30.
- the $7.56 brunch buffet meant that my fiance's brothers could have a pancake eating contest
- fresh fruit, homemade sausage, and made-to-order omelets included as part of the brunch
- a pleasant pajama-clad server

Was it worth it?
- it was freezing in the entrance seating area and freezing in the dining room until someone complained and they jacked the heat up - then we were unpleasantly warm.
- either my coffee or the spoon they put in it tasted like dish soap
- no clear instructions on whether/not you can reuse your brunch plates, so my fiance's brothers were snapped at by the host, referred to in another review as the \"weird dude who walked around and seated people\" whose \"demeanor...may be concealing a hidden evil\".  (best review ever)

I was the only one out of our group who ordered off the way-too-cutesy menu, and while I was pleased with my choice, I'm not sure I was really 'pleased' with my meal.  I ordered the B.E.L.T. - a BLT with \"spicy arugula lettuce\", oven-roasted tomato, a fried egg, bacon, and herbed mayo on a baguette.  This sandwich was literally 4-5 inches tall - not a chance of biting through it without Jaws's metal teeth.  I ate it with a knife and fork, enjoying the over-hard egg, bacon, and herbed mayo much more than the soggy tomato and the \"arugula lettuce\" layer, which was more the latter than the former, at least in taste.

I don't know.  I like supporting new neighborhood-y restaurants, and I like what 56 West is trying to do, but I was underwhelmed by their brunch, and the lack of booze means we're unlikely to try it for dinner.  Alas."}
{"text":"While it tries, 56 West has never impressed me. The food is a mixed bag. I loved the BELT sandwich, but its ahi tuna sandwich is watery and bland. The wait staff are questionable--usually a mixed-bag of hipsters that take their sweet time with getting drinks, getting food and getting bills. My last trip there, after we told the waiter we were ready to order,  he actually told the six of us to wait while he left to put in a request for a single appetizer in an empty restaurant. That experience was more than hour of waiting before our sandwiches arrived, during a slow lunch hour. 

But for me, the most egregious mistake were the names. Cute names for your food are fine--embarrassing names for your food are ridiculous. Try ordering \"An Italian Lover\" or a \"Single and Ready to Mingle\" without feeling like your whole meal just got a little too intimate. The restaurant isn't exactly a date spot--cute, but unless it's 8 p.m. and every candle in the place is lit, there's nothing romantic about ordering \"sultry\" slaw and \"Pure Pleasure\" potato pancakes. Either make your restaurant intimate and sexy for dates, or accept it's really a glorified burger joint and switch the names."}
{"text":"Decent food BUT everything else is simply horrid.

A few people had recommended from work so I had decided to go there with my wife for Saturday lunch.  Walked in from the back door since the parking lot was in rear.  Very dirty entry way then dirty curtain.  At the first glance the unisex bathroom is built on the side and occupying the corner of the main floor.  I think the wall is pretty thin, if you rip a large fart, i bet you can hear from outside :(

I believe we were served by the same guy people are mentioning on this review.  Just unacceptable attitude from the moment he seated us to delivering the final tab.  He was annoyed since i wanted to read the menu... made me feel like i was inconveniencing him.  After 10+ minutes, he finally comes back and took our order.  The place was pretty empty by that time we were about to order.  Ordered Ceasar salad first... when it was ready, he didn't say a word and just slid the plate on the table.  Our sandwiches came later (well after we finished our salad) but no side fries.  I had a hard time getting his attention and had to walk up to the front register.  He didn't acknowledge that he forgot to place on order.  After 15+ minutes, the side fries came and just like before, he had just dropped the fries without a word.  No \"I'm sorry\" or \"my bad, it's on us\".  We ate fries just as is - we had already finished out sandwiches.

The bottom line:  Sticky table, sticky menu, VERY slow service and EXTREMELY RUDE server!  I wouldn't go back until someone tells me they have hired someone new with people skills.  I guess this place is going to be remodeled - which is a good thing.  I hope his attitude gets remodeled too."}
{"text":"Tumbled in for the PJ Brunch on a Sunday morning. I must say, it was just what my hangover desired.

The guy and I dropped in with little to no expectations other than hot coffee and grease. What we found was a rockin' deal, of a brunch and a friendly waitstaff. SCORE.

If you find yourself hankering for a lot of breakfast this Sunday drop into 56 west for this cheap, cheap, delicious deal ($8.56 for a buffet?!?). The biscuits and gravy are heavenly. Buffet offerings are not your average rubber scrambled eggs and burnt bacon. We enjoyed French Toast, Eggs Benedict, hashbrowns, and perfectly prepared bacon, amongst other things...we were hungry ;)

I am eager to try the regular menu but have yet to. We scoped it out while waiting on a friend and both decided the food sounded well worth a dinner date.

The waiter who took care of us was really nice and very talkative. It was like I was sitting in a friends kitchen for brunch rather than a busy restaurant. Definite win. We will be returning."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for Brunch on a Sunday. It's only $8.56 for a decent selection of pancakes, french toast, eggs benedict, sausages, biscuits and gravy, and even build-your-own omelets. Decent selection and quality for the price. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I went to 56W to meet up with a friend for lunch. I can't name anything I didn't like - GREAT food, great menu/selection, friendly, out-of-the-way service, very affordable prices, hip decor, what's not to love?

I had one of their famous gourmet burgers (about $9), a 'make your own' with good quality beef, great hearty fresh bakery bun, their house-made chipotle sauce, fresh avacado, and a side of sweet potato fries. The quality of the ingredients were great, the food was well prepared, and the food arrived quick and right from the kitchen.

My friend ordered their sandwich of the day, a Dr. Pepper infused open-face steak sandwich on the bakery roll with cheese and their house-made horseradish.

With two sandwiches and a fresh (and quickly refilled) cup of coffee, the bill came to only about $25 + tip. 

The place is small (one Lakewood storefront for seating, and the adjoining storefront size for the kitchen etc.) so I could see the dining room filling up quickly during weekend dinner service...however there was absolutely no wait around 11:30a-12:30p on a weekday when we went and we could sit where we liked.

My only disappointment was the fact that the staff and other patrons didn't spontaneously break into dance as their short web video had advertised. I was really looking forward to that, despite my lack of skill.

I can't wait to come back, this is definitely one of Lakewood's hidden gems!"}
{"text":"I have visited 56 West at least 3-4 times in the past two years or so. Most recently just a few weeks ago. I have given it multiple tries because I really wanted to like it. It is a Lakewood restaurant that I can walk to easily. However, every time I have gone I have been disappointed in one way or another. Although the food is not that expensive I would say that it is not a very good value and simply average at the very best. I also find the ambiance to be a bit odd - a cross between dilapidated appearing mom and pop shop and cheap chic - and I have found the cleanliness of the place to leave something to be desired too. Two of the times I visited in the warmer months it was was very warm inside. Once is was so hot I considered leaving before ordering my food. Not sure if there A/C was down or that is just par for the course here. 

Ultimately, there are so many great dining places in the Lakewood area I think there is no need to go back and I do not anticipate I will go back unless friends or family are insistent. I truly wish I could say otherwise. One of the best things about Lakewood is the number of local establishments that one can easily get too simply using shoe wear and the sidewalk but as for 56 West these shoes will likely keep right on walking."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my boyfriend the other day. We were the only people in there. In every way I thought the place very below average and generally unspecial. There are so many places I like more in the area, so I highly doubt we will go back. 

I went to use the bathroom right as we walked in and noticed immediately the bathroom was very dirty. I have seen cleaner gas station bathrooms! Normally this fact would have caused me to leave, but 56 West had been our third choice that day and we were actually frustrated about just finding somewhere to have lunch already, and we were actually using a gift certificate.. so I let it slide. 

The service was mixed. The poor girl was nice enough and eager, but lacked in knowledge of the menu and had to run back and forth asking questions, no issue there bc she may have just been new.. but if that was the case, it doesn't seem like they trained her at all. 

My boyfriend wanted goat cheese on his side salad and they started to say they wouldn't do that, that that was only for their entree salads ...then the guy came back and said fine that it'll be 1$ extra. We never mind up-charges for things customized a bit but they whole conversation that it took to get that was a bit weird.

When the food came and it was really good. I had the philly cheese steak and he had the burger. Both were very good. The fries were also excellent. But.. I had a huge amount of trouble eating and enjoying this delicious cheesesteak due to the plate it was brought out on. They serve their food on flat metal pans covered with paper. That would be acceptable for pizza or some other foods,  but it made eating the cheese steak very tough. The paper became soggy very quickly and was actually ripping every time I attempted to cut into my fork and knife cheesesteak. It was pretty gross and I kept having to pick bits of shrively paper off my fork and out of my food.. with every bite I was never sure if I was eating paper or not with my sandwich. 

Also we were trying to have a conversation at the table and the waitress was doing busy work hovering right around us the entire time. We kept lowering our voices and pausing, but she did not seem to get it. Did I mention we were the only people in the restaurant? It was just awkward. 

All is all, not a fan at all. 

(The only reason they got 2 stars not 1 star is because the food was actually really good, and the waitress was friendly despite being inexperienced as a server.)"}
{"text":"All of a sudden I have been hearing great things about this place, so I made it a point to try it.  I am happy to report that upon initial investigation, the hype is worth believing.  

I have no idea why a menu made up of pretty standard sounding items (sandwiches, burgers, grilled meat/fish) seemed so extraordinary, but it really did.  I suppose it has to do with the expanded types of cheese and homemade sauces.  The ribald dish names (menage a trois pomme fromage, friends with benefits) are a cute touch too.

Everything is fresh, and the prices are very good (pretty much everything is under $10) and the Beautiful sunrise burger I ordered was delicious.  It was also sloppy, but that doesn't bother me. 

The sweet potato fries were VERY good, very sweet with a light touch of a spicy chile rub.  And the Instant Gratification cheese fries were very tasty too. 

The GF ordered and grilled chicken large plate, which requires you to choose meat, sauce, salad, and carb.  The chicken itself was a little bland, but the ground mustard sauce was delicious.  I suspect the combinatory nature of the large plates means they could be hit or miss, and not necessarily representative of 56W as a whole. 

I really liked 56W, and it's about 2 minutes from home, so I am pretty sure  I will be returning with some regularity.  If you're in Lakewood and want  a great sandwich, it's nice to know there are more options than Melt and Beer Engine."}
{"text":"I went to 56 West on March 13th, 2009 for Mom's 60th b-day. This type of restaurant is new to Lakewood and unique to the location. My Mom was bummed because they did not have wine. The beer list was decent. There was a weird dude who walked around and seated people. His demeanor was very odd and he may be concealing a hidden evil. My Mom said that he seemed like an alien trapped in a human body. This made me recall the classic movie by John Carpenter starring Rowdy Roddy Piper, They Live. I thought he seemed more like Tom Schimmels from Coven or American Movie. A weird dude in every sense of the word. The server could not have been sweeter and was very attentive to my brother's needs as a vegan. The place reminded me of a Tremont-esque restaurant. The build-a-burger option seemed interesting. I had the flat-iron steak which was ok. My Mom had a 3 cheese potato dish. It was called Menage-a-Trois Fromage Potatoes or something. Not always something you want to hear from your Mom's mouth but oh well. I tried it and it was good. Kind of weird names for the dishes, a lot of sexual innuendos. It was a memorable time for my Mom's birthday celebration."}
{"text":"I had the omelette bar on a Sunday morning to go. It does not have a racy name so i dubbed it \"Fox in the Henhouse\". Very fluffy and filling. I got a side of fruit, toast and home fries. I had to take my meal down to the park to share with my dog. So i can't vouch for the service, other than it was damn quick. But the wife has eaten there and says the servers are nice. So nice in fact, that the reason we were there that morning was to drop off a tip from the last time she ate there. The server never got it as it did not show up on the credit card statement. So make sure your server gets their tip, because management is a bit shady and will just shovel receipts into the drawer."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars! Let's get this place some business. They said they have been open for 4 years so I was surprised when we were the only three people in the whole place after a party of 2 who was there when we got there left. While there was some takeout action, for a Thursday night I think this place should have been much busier. My only con is that the kitchen was a little slow, but please read on for all the pros of my dinner! The waiter and other staff were super friendly and attentive. The menu is pretty big and has more on it than just burgers, tho burgers is what we all got. I loved that they had listed on their create your own burger list a \"in a blow of greens\" option. They also offered whole wheat buns and french baguettes as bread options. I ordered one of their homemade creations but requested it in a bowl of greens and it was delicious! The cajun fries were super spiced and the sweet potato fries were so good. They make all of their sauces in house - from the ketchup to the Cesar dressing. All their interesting sauces to play around with when making your own creation. If you want beer help yourself- wander up to the two coolers and make your selection, they'll open the bottle at your table for you. ....I will definitely be back to this place and will tell others about it like I am now. And note that there is a huge (for Lakewood) parking lot in the back - the only thing is that it was not lit, but there were plenty of spots to park which is a nice thing for a Lakewood shop. I highly recommend it! I kinda like this place better than B Spot - (can I say that?)"}
{"text":"Took a detour here after finding out the wait at Melt was 2 hours. Ordered the Beautiful Sunrise burger (burger w/ pancetta, fried egg, cheese-subbed gruyere in for american cheese) which was good except i think it would've been better if the egg wasn't overdone (read: no runny yolk after biting in) but that's a personal preference. Unfortunately, I probably had the best food out of my party and everyone ordered something different (philly steak and BELT sandwiches). I do have to say the fries with garlic aioli are really good and probably the most outstanding part of the meal."}
