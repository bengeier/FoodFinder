{"text":"Bonne cuisine fusion (l'Espagne rencontre la Corée), chef humain et sympathique, service courtois. À notre première visite, nous avons demandé un mélange de tous leurs pintxos, tous excellents. Accompagnés d'un vin de clémentines bien frais, un régal.  Il ne semble pas y avoir d'adresse internet, mais ils ont une page Facebook : www.facebook.com/RestaurantTaisToiEtMange"}
{"text":"Cote-des-Neiges has not always been known for its upscale and trendy restaurants. Despite some few good adresses, it has always been viewed as a mecca for cheap (but still tasty!) food. With the openings of a few notable restaurant in the last years and with Tais-toi et mange we are now onto something. In fact, this beautiful and hip place opened its door last summer and just from the outside you could see that the atmosphere is more Saint-Laurent than the usual Cote-des-Neiges we know.  Now as for the food, I remember their initial menu was a cuisine which consist of a fusion between spanish and korean food, which was quite unusual but the end product was extremely tasty and different...in a good way. Now I went back yesterday to realize that the type of cuisine has completely changed to southern food. It was a bit of a shock at first because I really did enjoy the idea of the korean touche being a fan of this type of cuisine but after one bite of my salmon tartar, i understood that they may have changed the type of cuisine but the quality and innovation of the meal had not changed one bit. In fact, the salmon tartar had a touch of lemongrass in it and it changed from the usual way that tartar is usually made. Same goes for the beef tataki, a simple yet effective meal I thought had a different twist from the other places because of the gochujang that was added. Followed a Cobb Salad that I can only describe as eccletic with full of texture.   Also, the day we went (tuesday) there was a special Ladies night, and who doesnt love a free drink ? There seems to be a promotion every day so it might be a good idea to drop by and check their promos. And even without their specials, the price of the food is quite affordable.   Overall, an amazing place that I highly recommend in an area where trendy place has not always been the norm. Who knows, cote-des-neiges might become the next hot spot."}
{"text":"Discovered this gem and boy im so glad I came across this restaurant. I've been on a hunt for good southern American  food. Super friendly waitress and chef! Ordered a drink but was suggested by the chef a fizzy drink made out of gin it was so good! Didn't order an appetizer since I was overwhelmed with all the yummy items on the menu. Got the ribs and fried chicken , Mac n cheese and fries. It came with a biscuit n a salad. The ribs were moist and tasty , as for the chicken I thought it was a bit over fried , but it was juicy! The Mac n cheese wasn't not to my liking. It was bland. My friend ordered  the 2 pieces of chicken came with mash potatoes n gravy. The meal was nicely presented on a cutting wood board. I definitely recommend this spot for a date or simply to enjoy good food . It Won't break your wallet. I will definitely be going back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"I was so sad when this great restaurant closed... it got amazing fusion food, my fav being burger au porc effiloche! The meat was juicy and very flavorful, unique of its kind. The ambiance is soothing and very modern, great place for a date or a conversation over a meal. Would love to know if the owner would open another similar business."}
