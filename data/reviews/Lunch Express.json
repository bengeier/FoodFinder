{"text":"I love to order their breakfast while I'm in my way to work and then it arrives as I do!! Rs a pretty amazing thing. The food is excellent, never greasy or soggy by the time it arrives and the prices are great. Their breakfast sandwich and coolatta is amazing. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Love Lunch Express! They are quick and delicious. Our order is always correct, Joe and the team are always nice and the food is always tasty."}
{"text":"Just ordered here for delivery, the people were extremely friendly and the food was great!  5 Stars since that was the freshest chicken quesadilla I have had and the guacamole was good.  Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos in Scottsdale!  I could eat these all day.  You get what you pay for as they're stuffed full of delicious ingredients."}
{"text":"I spoke to lunch express moments ago. The person on the phone tried to guilt trip me into spending more so it could be delivered. It says $1 delivery and I wanted to order a burrito. I could not have this done because I apparently was not spending enough. You should be able to purchase a burrito and pay the $1 fee for delivery. Nowhere on the site does it have a minimum expectation set for the amount needed to spend to get delivery."}
{"text":"When I ordered delivery we had miscommunication on the pick up location George the owner offered me a free meal I came down nice small restaurant pleasant relaxed clean George was funny he made my day and the food was delicious had the Philly steak, macaroni and potatoes salad everything was delicious and the experience was amazing I recommend this place Ask for George he will make your day"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting.  First off, the guy won't make any special orders for his customers.  His egg sandwiches stink like feet and are slimy.  I tried his fried eggs and found pubic hairs on them.  I wouldn't recommend this place to my enemies."}
{"text":"This place has the best lunch in Scottsdale. Great food at a great price. Use them all the time. Have lunch delivered three times a week. They have the fastest delivery, in Scottsdale. Also a very friendly  staff. They have gone above  and  beyond  for us quite a few times. With big last minute  orders. Over all love this place."}
{"text":"Since when is the main ingredient in pesto, mayonnaise. I hate mayonnaise. If I want mayo I'd have asked for it. It should be labeled pesto mayo, not pesto. 

Anyway, decent food and they deliver."}
{"text":"I just ordered for the first time today and i was really impressed.  Everything in my salad was super fresh. They were fast and friendly.  Next time i might try their delivery service."}
{"text":"Usually when I order from them the food is good. This morning it was beyond awful. Couldn't even eat the eggs. Didn't taste fresh at all. It's enough to not order from them again."}
{"text":"Gross overpriced food with rude ownership. There are several cheaper better alternatives around the area."}
{"text":"No idea why this place get so many good reviews for the quality of food and service.

Pro:
First of all I frequent this place a lot but only because of convenience (Very close to work) and needing to eat something quickly. 

Cons:
- Pricey for barely average food and you cant really customized your order. One time i ordered for 2 eggs and 4 pieces of small bacon strips that came up burnt for $6.00. I mean rly? If anything make sure the bacons you serve aren't burnt. I stopped ordering bacons since then.

- Food is inconsistence. About 60% chances, I would get the baked potato barely cook or the quantity of meat/other substitutes varied sometime fair and somewhat reasonable other not reasonable for the cost you paid.

- I agree with review above the owner of this business need to learn how to service people. First of all I don't care about your personal woes or whatever the hell you think is important. I'm here to order food, paid for it and leave. If I don't respond to your \"conversation\" by giving you subtle cue to not encouraged conversation, stopped doing the same thing over and over. It's incredibly annoying and honestly in some cases unprofessional depending on the subject of the conversation. I saw the cook looked unhappy whenever I was there. I'm sure there is other reason why he is unhappy but I think partially because the owner doesn't know how to shut up.

- No joke one time i saw the owner pick on his ear, lick the same finger while counting some cash. Disgusting.  It's why i hate it when they grab utensils for me. No thanks let me get it myself.

- When one of your employees make mistakes with customer order, an apology would be nice. Not much for common sense???

If you actually have time and convenient isn't a factor, go somewhere else. You will get better food with similar price going to fast food place than this place."}

{"text":"Ordered avocado toast and extra crispy bacon. 

I gave 1 star because I ordered at 9:38 and it was delivered at 9:57 which for me was prompt and fast

2nd star is for the extra crispy bacon : it was very good!! Crispy just how I like and there was a decent portion 


Missing 3 stars was because frankly what they call avocado toast is unacceptable (see picture). First off it was bread and not toasted hardly at all. They had laid slices of avocado, very very thin slices at that on the bread it wasn't even mashed up. And then just put some tomato on top. I see where they were going here but it completely missed the mark. I will never order this again here 

I will give them another shot because of the bacon and see if they can make up for this."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today I had the roasted Arizona and an iced tea it was delivered quickly and tasted good. Very convenient. I can't wait to try the breakfast"}
{"text":"Not exactly a mystery as to why my last review was removed, so allow me to rephrase:

I find the gentleman who works here (an establishment I've been frequenting for over 8 years), the guy who owns this place, to be quite rude.  Much more than that.  I find the way he treats customers to border on psychopathy.  He'll never have my business again unless he apologizes."}
{"text":"You guys saved me in a pinch!! Food was excellent and filled with a variety of options! Salad was crispy, tasty, and the Roaated Arizona Sandwich was bomb!"}
{"text":"Love Lunch Express! They are always timely on their delivery and ordering is very easy over the phone. The food is always delicious!"}
{"text":"We have been ordering Lunch Express at our office for a while now. The food is GREAT. May be the best roast beef sandwich ever and the horse radish blend is the bomb not to mention the bread!!! We have run through most of the menu at this point and we are never let down. I also had the pleasure of going in the place once to pick up food and it was a fantastic experience. The guys that worked there were personable and greeted everyone with a great attitude. Top notch customer service. We LOVE this place and will be patrons for many years."}
{"text":"NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHATSOEVER!  You better repeat your order ten times to them, and call after you order online, because this place is so poorly managed our last 5 orders were messed up.  From doubling an order by accident and making the customer pay for it, forgetting portions of the order and waiting up to 2 HOURS TO GET THE FOOD, to placing an online order, waiting an hour, calling and they didn't even check their email! Not worth the pain and unreliability, avoid until this is under new management and decide to make customer service a priority."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here several times, mainly because it is easy. The food isn't that good and the service is worse however it's easy. I have called to complain on several occassions about the order taking over an hour and half to get there. The last time I ordered there was a bug in my salad. When I called to complain the first thing the guy said was you are not the first person to say that today. They did reluctantly refund my money. I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"This place delivers quickly to my office and often remembers the names of regulars. Delivery doesn't cost much and my orders have always been right."}
{"text":"SIMPLY THE BEST!    Had Lunch Express cater an office party and they did a top notch job!  The food was just wonderful and the presentation was much better than what you would think a simple little lunch-stop would do.  The are NOT just a \"Lunch Express\" go-to place, but also breakfast!  Joe really cares and is wonderful at what he does. If you haven't tried this place--please DO!  Bravo and Thanks!"}
{"text":"I ordered sandwiches for an open house I was hosting and couldn't be happier!  I ordered a variety of different sandwiches and wraps and each one was perfect and delivered right on time!  I couldn't be happier with the quality and professional service and you can't beat the price!  This is my new go to place for all of my lunch functions!  Thanks Joe!"}
{"text":"My coworkers highly recommended this delivery service, so I had to try it. I must say, I was not disappointed. I ordered the Turkey Panini, and it arrived to me still steaming. As a side, I tried the potato salad-- which was also very tasty. Next time, I'm ordering breakfast. The omelets look delicious!"}
{"text":"We loved everything we had. Service was great as well. We were in line for maybe 2 minutes and waited maybe 5 for our food. We had the Malibu chicken sandwich on some sort of fresh baked bread. I dont know if they make it there but if they don't, they buy it fresh everyday. The Greek salad was typical but the dressing was bomb! The star of the show for me was the soup. There were 2 choices, jalepeno hominy or chicken gumbo. We went with the gumbo and I'm telling you now, whoever makes the soup is a master soup maker! So delicious with tons of veggies, including okra, carrots and onions. Its a little tucked away in the bottom of an office building but you should find it and go there. Yum!!"}
