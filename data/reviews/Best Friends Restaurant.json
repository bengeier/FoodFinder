{"text":"Boy oh boy... Where to start...This use to be my usual every Sunday spot after a long night of partying.   I use to walk in here and be greeted with the friendliest staff in the world!

One day I walked in here and everyone was gone. I believe that this place is now under new management and has gone down the drain dramatically.  I usually don't rate this low unless it truely deserved it, based on service, atmosphere and food.

First impressions..this place is completely dead nowadays.  We walked in and the hostess was completely glued to the tv. We were literally standing there for a good 5 mins until my brother cleared his throat lol.  We sat down and already knew what we wanted since we pretty much know the breakfast menu in and out.  We ordered two orders of the two egg breakfast with sausage with a side of bacon. She then brought out two orders one with bacon and one with sausage. We then went and explained to her we both had sausage with sides of bacon.  She then brought out another side of bacon, which looked like it was quickly microwaved and totally tasted like chewy crap.  The order of sausage? Nowhere to be found....

We then asked for our check we got charged for 2x's sides of bacon and sausage. (the sausage was suppose to be included in the breakfast)  we didn't even bother to say anything and just paid the bill.

All in all... The service was horrid.  The food has gone down the drain..What a bad experience. Back then I would have given this place a 4/5 easy.
Figures why they're cutting hours and 2nd shift. This place needs help!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go to Best Friends for Sunday breakfast/brunch probably around twice a month.  Nothing fancy, just your standard breakfast fare: eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles.  But the food is very consistently good, and the wait staff is absolutely fantastic; always extremely friendly and attentive.  Even with a big breakfast and a generous tip, we can easily eat there for under $20 for both of us.  We have tried a bunch of other places like it around Mentor, but nothing else has come close.

We have been there a few times for lunch and dinner.  While the staff is still just as nice, the food isn't as good.  But for your standard, nothing fancy American breakfast, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I went here to catch up with a long-time friend and was rather curious as to how they were going to turn the old Pizza Hut into a new joint. 

I went in and there was a rather large amount of elderly folks in there. Not that I mind (as I loved my grandparents dearly) but it was rather funny for half the restaurant to turn around to look at/gasp/whatever-they-did when they saw my faux-hawk-ish hair-do.

Besides the initial stare-down, the waitress we had was attentive (almost overly so at times which I would've normally found rather annoying but I was too hungover to care) and nice. The food is your average breakfast fair - nothing special but did the trick, nonetheless.

Would I return? Meh. Possibly I guess? I'm still in debate about that."}
