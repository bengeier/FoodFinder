{"text":"So I like this place! Food is good!  It definitely had to grow on me!    It was okay...as far as the food goes.  But it is a nice place to shoot pool and have a few drinks.  Something about the boneless chicken I didn't really like.  It was kind of tough and I don't think chicken is suppose to be tough lol. right?"}
{"text":"About 20 of us went into Johnny Malloy's on Friday night at about 10pm.  It was dead -- a handful of people at the bar and 5 people at 3 tables and the DJ was setting up for karaoke.  The kind server was starting to take our drink orders and had no issue with us doing separate checks until Billy (the manager, I assume) moseyed up.  He then instituted the rule that parties over 8 must be on separate checks.  We were only planning on drinking and likely pretty heavily -- we were celebrating a friend's birthday.  We offered to open individual tabs at the bar as we didn't really need table service anyway.  We were informed we'd have to sit at the bar then.  I was astonished at how Billy was acting given that his night was ridiculously slow.  While trying to get everyone together to leave and take our business elsewhere, one of our friend's karaoke songs came up and instead he interrupted us and told us to just leave.  They would've likely had hundreds of dollars in sales tonight but they chose to give their business to another bar.  I'd venture to say the owner wouldn't be so happy to hear about that...  I've had wonderful experiences at other Johnny Malloy's locations but this one was absolutely terrible."}
{"text":"I never decline an invite to stop by for a beer and dinner here. The food is tasty and cooked very fast. I'd say a fairly decent beer selection and tons of liquor.   Stop by on Karaoke night as its a lot of fun. Even just to watch and listen. All kinds of people will come in and chill out, sing a song, drink some more. Everyone is very laid back and nice. Service is decent and better at times.   Like I said, I will never decline an invite to have a drink here. Stop by. Its rather inviting."}
{"text":"Not great. We ordered delivery and they got our food wrong twice. Then when I called and they sent what we were supposed To have it was missing a side dish that I already plaid for. My boyfriends salad was sub par and had huge chunks of uncut lettuce. We may try it again because it was so close - but overall, not that great."}
{"text":"Ordered carryout, but at the wrong location. Woops. We went ahead and ordered more food at this location, only to realize that the other location was going to deliver it.   The delivery was no charge, and when charged for our new food the cashier didn't even ring us up for the full total. He apologized many times and felt really bad. He gave us two sodas on the house while we waited.   Food was decent, not amazing but not bad either. Would come here again to try other items on the menu, to drink and to play pool.  There was a gay pride fest going on...dancin in the streets...right outside. There was a girl sitting at the bar with just stockings, heels, panties, and nipple cover-up sticker things. She was pretty much nude. I mean I don't really mind, it's not like she was the one cooking our food, but it was a little strange...esp. when a family with two kids walked into the restaurant......aren't there health laws against that sort of thing?"}
{"text":"Miss the place!  The drinks were good, the wings were good, even the pizza was good! I may go to the one in Lakewood one day, but when that new shopping center is built alongside with the former Christian Scientist Church (how cool would that be as a bar)? I hope for a newer, stronger Johnny Malloy's!  Great memories!"}
{"text":"Food is always wrong it takes forever and forget about ordering delivery!"}
{"text":"Simply put, I like this place.  Especially in the summer.  It's central location is great for people watching during happy hour with a beer and friends.  The chicken quesadilla is surprisingly excellent.  I never have tried their pizza which I can only assume is equally delicious.    Being seated outside during the day I notice I get neglected by the waitress who also tends bar, so I understand.  Beyond that though, no complaints.  I continue to go there.  :)"}
{"text":"I do not know how many times I have gone in there and have had things mysteriously appear on my tab.... Will never go there again"}
{"text":"This place has your typical bar fare. Beware of the specials--they are cheap but sport a 2 drink minimum, and if you don't finish you can't take it home--weird for food you paid for right?    I used to come all the time for the specials which would have given this place a four star. However, with the strict enforcement of these rules, I'm finding someone else to give my $$ to."}
{"text":"I usually don't like to let my anger get the best of me. Sometimes it does. This review is the result of anger. Anger that has built up like molten lava. This review is the volcano. The bartenders here need to find new jobs. I am done coming here. I rather go to one of the creepiest bars I know: Tick Tock. My friends love the Tick Tock. They pour heavy. The chicks that work here, well, forget it. I just don't like them. You wait around for them to be done talking to be served. You may as well dress in a purple shroud, join the Heaven's Gate cult and throw on some Nikes. The Hale Bopp comet will probably travel by before you get served."}
{"text":"I almost want to make this a five, but that would be silly. Food wise.   After i left Hessler around 9 on Sunday, i craved Master pizza of Mayfield and drove there. They closed at 8. Went to Pizza Bazaar in Euclid. Closed. Stumbled upon Beach Club Bistro. Open, hallelujah! Kitchen was closed. It's now close to eleven and time to pick up the wife from Corey Feldman extravaganza at the Beachland. Last option was Gepetto's. They were open, quick in the preparation, and a little bit more expensive than i remember, but whatever...Thank you guys for realizing not everyone keeps bankers' hours. Some people actually like to do stuff on a Sunday night. Pizza actually tastes like it's getting better. Fried shrooms are consistently...available. Plus there were again people hanging out there, so that our corner of Cleve does not resemble the ghost town of the eastern burbs. There was even a dude with what we termed a \"brohawk\" or a \"scrohawk\". Couldn't decide.  I have two words for businesses that pack it in early on the  weekend - - F*ck you."}
