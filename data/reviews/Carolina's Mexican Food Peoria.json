{"text":"Good cheap Mexican food, but like a previous comment, it gets harder and harder to keep going back.  The way they process orders is annoying, but that's not a deal-breaker if the food is worth it.  I've ordered breakfast burritos and enchiladas for lunch mostly.  Chips cost extra.  The salsa isn't remarkable.  Overall the food is just okay - good enough to stop by if it's on the way to somewhere else - not good enough to make a trip specifically to dine there."}
{"text":"I have been to the Carolina's Original Location many times and always enjoy but sadly this location does not boast the same consistency. I ordered a combination taco tostada and enchilada with rice and beans. What a mess was served, a tostada with beans on one edge covered with wilted lettuce and the cheese missed the top and ended on the rice. The enchilada was simmilar with only 1/2 with cheese and sauce strewn across the foam container. To complete the disaster the taco was broken in three sections and covered with lettuce to hide the mess. It might have been a one time mistake or a new cook and I will try again as I always enjoyed the original location and like this location."}
{"text":"We visited this place while we were visiting some foodie friends in Phoenix. They were raving about this place and I love me some Mexican food so they drug us here.  Firstly, I didn't know what to expect because the place looks fast foody, but once you get your amazing food in front of you it's like the rays of heaven come down and shine on their tacos, anything weird or whatever about the place disappears.  The chicken taco was A-Maz-In!!!! Stuffed with chicken, lots of cheese, pour some of their salsa on it... oh dear, I've gotten overexcited. :) I had a taco and two tamales, which weren't the greatest honestly, but I've eaten fresh homemade tamales most of my life so I'm a bit spoiled. They were made with beef instead of pork (my favorito), but the beef was good, just not my cup of tea. From what I understand, they don't serve any pork there which is just bummer but eh, their chicken is pretty good.  I also had a bite of my friends red chili chicken burrito and was instantly jealous I didn't get one of those too. :(   Let me say, they bought a package of their freshly made giant tortillas and...shudder. They were absolutely perfection. So yummy in the morning with melted cheese on them.  I really liked this place and will definitely go back next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We checked out this hole in the wall after staying at a nearby resort just because of yelpers. It was good. We weren't overly impressed and never made our way back but it is worth checking out if you're in the area and want a fast food feel but more authentic mexican."}
{"text":"Went here around lunchtime, it was super busy. The food was very good, but it was kind of noisy for my tastes. I'd like to try more from here, see if they have a decent salsa besides their hot sauce which is, well. Hot sauce and not my preference for dipping chips in."}
{"text":"This location needs some serious attention. This is the 3rd time I have been here and it has gotten worse each time.  This time 25 minute wait for carne asada, diet Dr Pepper was flat, ice was out but they were in the process of refilling.  Just not the same as downtown."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food spots! Yummy tortillas and red chili my son and daughters love the food also! If your in Peoria stop by and grab amazing food. I believe closed on Sunday's which says a lot about a restaurant."}
{"text":"My gal brought food home for the family and one particularly for her Grandma after all I'm not a picky eater but are eager to try the new food and start digging in. Her grandma has no teeth so she doesn't immediately bite into it which thankfully she didn't cause the would have been a disaster, she open up the burrito to start eating the meat and finds a water beetle little guy probably missed in kerfuffle looked like a pepper but should have took a picture. I dont waste food so i ate it anyway but everyone didn't want to eat after that so now i have a a fridge full of uneaten Carolinas nobody else but me willing to touch. My first time eating there and I rate a D, I probably would have gotten a better meal from a roach couch, meat was bland tasted dry and had to cook dinner for the other who will more than likely never trust there food"}
{"text":"The one in Phoenix is way better I like the original better I go out of my  way to drive to south Phoenix"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. Doesn't quite compare to the original location but it's alright. Employees aren't too friendly they try rushing you to get to the next customer which then makes none of the customers feel appreciated. It's extremely loud in there no matter what time I go which makes it difficult to go there as a family"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican foods ... not the gigantic burritos that some of the Berto's places have. This place is quality over quantity!  ... Get in line ,the vibe here keeps this place hopping! Enjoy."}
{"text":"We love Carolina's!  Make sure you order the chips and salsa--they cost extra but are worth it!  The salsa is great, the food is affordable, and I recommend the Carne Asada."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love this place. We sometimes eat there 3 times a week. We always love the food and the staff is great. They know our order as soon as they see us and start ringing us up. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"If anyone thinks this place is authentic... I wonder what they consider Taco Bell to be? Heaven? I had the bland Chicken Burro which was very disappointing. Then I also had 2 Tamales with Rice and Beans. My friend had 2 Cheese Enchilada plate. When we opened them, we couldn't tell the difference. They were both swimming in the same canned sauce. The only way to tell the difference was finding the maize from a Tamale. As for the rice, I never knew Spanish Rice was supposed to be crunchy and undercooked.... Just over all a let down. AZ should open the border back up and get real food here. If you are a true foodie, don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"Over priced for poor quality food. Not authentic Mexican food at all. I downloaded yelp just to review this place. Better off going to fillibertos I should've known it had good stars because mostly only white people use yelp."}
{"text":"First, the only reason this place gets three (3) stars is because of the food. The food is great! Probably the best Mexican food on the (very) west side. The reality of this place: It doesn't seem like anyone pays much attention to cleanliness. The two (2) times that I did dine in were enough. Food left on tables for over an hour; workers handling food after mopping (granted it was their own food, but if they do it to their own food...); and trash on the floors.   All-in-all: The food is great, but the facility is a dump. Do yourself a favor and get takeout."}
{"text":"This place sucks plain and simple I won't be coming back. I order a carne asada wet burrito. The salsa they use is from a can. The agua frescas suck too. There's a smell that won't go away maybe because they sell fresh chorizo."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had, and the freshly made tortillas are outstanding. The red chile chimichanga is very tasty too, but I haven't sampled much of the rest of the menu because the tacos are hard to pass up!"}
{"text":"Best food ever. Loved the way they cook their food and how it melts in your mouth. Truly amazing place to eat. Clean and friendly... 5 stars all the way around..."}
{"text":"Stooped by today for lunch after seeing the parking lot full everyday. It was very busy and crowded inside. I ordered the Machaca and bean burro. Even though they were very busy, it took only about 12 minutes to get my food. The staff were all smiling. Even the prep cooks in the back. You hardly ever see that in restaurants.   I got my burro to go and was pleasantly surprised how good it was. It cost about $4.50 and for the price the quality was pretty good. Limited garnishes though. You are limited to a mild red salsa, some dried herbs and tired looking diced green onions.  Great for a tasty quick lunch. Don't go if you are trying to find the best Mexican food in town. It is good but not South Phoenix taco truck good. They are perfect for a grab and go on the way to a family event though."}
{"text":"Hello my fellow Mexican food eater!!!!! I will admit I do love their shredded beef tacos......but that is where my taste buds drawn the line.........FOR NO REASON SHOULD YOU EVER EAT A RED OR GREEN TAMALE from here. Its about the size of a thick short terd and looks like one too. If for any reason you believe that their tamales are good. You don't know what good Mexican food is. They should be ashamed for trying to sell those to the public."}
{"text":"We came to Carolinas today and it is always so delicious and good they keep the restaurant very clean...however i will never buy the enchiladas again nor will my daughter i hate to say this but so true all the over food is delicious"}
{"text":"Delicious food; terrible service. After no greeting, no smile, a 16 minute wait for a combo, no apology, no \"thank you,\" and a very sloppy container delivered to me, I was done. The food, however, was so good that I had to bump up the rating a notch or two. Because of the food, I'll give it one more try, but the service needs to be better."}
{"text":"Just had these guys food via take out at work. mild and bland. Beans were runny.little flavor from the enchiladas. Definitely recommend carrumbas or macayos over these guys."}
{"text":"Are you kidding?! My first visit to Carolina's was divine! I live most of the year in Seattle dreaming about great Mexican food... This trip, I found what I was looking for at Carolinas. I'd read about the restaurants in several magazines and finally made it to the west location.   My family and I sampled several dishes. The highlight being the enchilada sauce and tamales (red and green). I also enjoyed the taco and refried beans. All of the dishes satisfied my craving for authentic mexican food.  Carolina's has rocketed to the top of my Arizona \"must do\" list. I will visit often!"}
{"text":"The food is okay, the prices are really good.  I think their food is very greasy.  I love their shredded beef tacos!  Its definately a place you should try at least once."}
{"text":"I haven't stopped in for a couple/few years - still as good as I remember! I cook for a living, and I very seldom eat out. This was well worth my hard earned money.  Keep up the good work chefs!!"}
{"text":"The food is really tasty but it's often hot in there and I've gotten sick the past two times I've been.  They have horchata which is amazing but the machine wasn't working the past two times I've been."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, great food! They easily have the best mexican in the area without having to drive to Arrowhead.   However the other half is service. Drinks, ice, salsa constantly seem to be out every time I'm there. The majority of the time it's 7:00 pm or later in which I will say they close at 9:00. But when it's 8:00 and you still have 5 people in line and half of your dining area is closed because it's been cleaned for the night you have got to be kidding. I'm all for trying to not stay late after a long day but your still a busy restaurant and have customers. 2 trash cans were closed because they had been emptied the other 2 were overflowing. It's not how you run a business. I hope management takes note and realizes when your open till 9, it's 9, not 8:15."}
{"text":"It took 30 minutes to get a two item take out order. food was tired by the time we got it. No reason to go back!"}
{"text":"Awesome torillas \"hechas a mano\" give this place that reminiscent feeling of being back in grandma's kitchen in  Mexico having some freshly handmade tortillas. Lunch hour is always packed but service is fast. Good but definitely not the greatest. I will say this: their hard-shell chicken tacos are the best. The chicken still had some cuerito on it (skin) giving it that extra flavor that sets it apart from regularly chopped chicken. Just pour some of that sauce they make on it and your good to go. ¡Buen Provecho!"}
{"text":"Not sure what people see! Hubby was supposed to have a chorizo burrito but couldn't find it with the massive potatoes in it. My chicken chimi was very bland! Guacamole had no flavor along with the tasteless rice. What Mexican food restaurant does give chips!!!! Won't be coming back!"}
{"text":"We started going to Carolinas when the closest one was near the airport in a not so secure part of Phoenix. However, we would always see the Phoenix PD there so we figured it must be as safe as it could be. The beef Chimi is really good. Just the right amount of beef, with more than enough sour creme and guacamole. Lucky for us, a new one opened just a few miles from our house in peoris so we are able to go more often."}
{"text":"Normally I would rate Carolinas much higher in stars except for today... I mean the food was good as usual, but the experience made me want scream...they let a patron with a DOG in a food establishment.... No no no... Not where I eat! I love dogs and love mine..but would never consider taking her in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Ahh.. That was gross. I feel like vomiting just remembering our experience there. I don't eat beef so we ordered flautas, burritos and tacos (all chicken). It was the same mixture of gross, bland chicken in all three items. The chicken looks horrible, has a disgusting texture and lacks in flavor. Also, the place is filthy like another reviewer mentioned. I didn't dare to go the bathroom but there was paper on the floor under every single table.The health department needs to shut them down!"}
{"text":"My latest Cheap Eat's favorite, if it was on the show \"the office\" this place would get a dunder, for those who don't watch \"the office\"...nevermind.  Ok Chimi's...excellent, chips homemade, salsa good (some might not like it because it is a real saucy kind, not chunky), rolled tacos good, Burritos excellent, haven't tried the tacos yet, red enchilada's were excellent as well.  Thank god Fazolis went out of business so Carolina's could move in!  Well it is time to hit a fine dining adventure, because I will not find a cheap eats like this one anytime soon!  Ok tried the taco's mucho good!  The only thing I don't like is the taco salads, just not my style of taco salads.  Oh butter tortillas...yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"I have given Carolina's several chances feeling that I was just not ordering the best items. The tortillas are not that good, no carne asada or black beans. This last try will be just that! I ordered a veggie burrito ASSuming it would have rice, beans and veggies. Nope I got home with a giant tortilla with lettuce, tomato and luckily I added guacamole. Still searching for a decent burrito in Phoenix that is not from Chipotle."}
{"text":"Cold food again. I live in the neighborhood so I've eaten here many times over the years.  Used to be a great place but the quality of the food and service has really gone down a lot over the last few months. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to review them since we first went there and now I'm glad I didn't. we've  been going there for about 7 months or so. First I fell in love w/ the shredded beef enchiladas and had them every time we went. But then they quit cooking the corn tortillas before they filled them,.. Yuk! So after a few of those I tried the red chile burrito... Again I loved it. Probably the last few months that has been my go to at least 2xs a week. But now (the last 3 or 4 xs) they have cut how much meat they put in it. And while I'm a fan of the sauce and the tortilla, Its just a large wet tortilla without the meat... Again Yuk! Last night was the last time for us. I wish I had taken a pic of it. The tortillas are huge , there was more than enough sauce and maybe 10 small pieces of meat. Really? That meat didn't fill 1/4 of the burrito !! I think we're done."}
{"text":"I always get the Machaca burrito with beans and cheese and love it.  The only reason they did not get 5 stars is because of the wait time to get food last week when I went there and the cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been going to Carolinas for almost ten years starting with the location in downtown Phoenix. While I still hold that this location isn't quite the same, it is still very delicious. Green chili burrito, red beef tamale, and a machaca taco are all solid choices for lunch or dinner. The beans are amazing. Whatever you get, get rice and beans, promptly mix together and mouthgasm."}
{"text":"Carolina's is one of the best Mexican food places in the west valley. The wait is long, sure, but if you call ahead of time and take it to go the wait is minuscule.   I normally get the #9 which has two tacos with rice and beans. The flavor of the beans is amazing plus they are rich and creamy.   The price is super cheap. A family of 3-4 can eat here for $25 and under.   I would recommend staying away from eating inside the place because it is a bit hectic and not always clean-- given that they are busy."}
{"text":"Enchiladas were ok. Don't both with the chips and salsa. The chips are cold and prepackaged and the salsa wasn't the greatest. Hubby enjoyed the tacos."}
{"text":"I would say that nothing stood out . The customer service was not great either. I thought that the food was basic and I was  not impressed by the experience. I will not go back to this place again.  Would you like feed back one how to improve. ... Get menu's for people who want to move  out if the way of crowds standing in line and decide on what they want to eat especially since I have never been there and also make your customers feel like they are not just another sale but appreciated with a thanks for your business or have a great day / night. Just a thought"}
{"text":"Great food. HORRIBLE service girls at register  are rude, not professional have tons of attitude  constantly on their phones texting.....cut keep up with who order what.....I would don't use this place to cater any of my business parties or to stop in to eat.  Customer service should always matter"}
{"text":"I came to Carolina's with high hopes.  I've heard so much about the location downtown that when I heard there was a location in my area - I was stoked.  I ordered a burrito with beans, cheese, green chile and eggs.  I opened it to devour and the tortilla was so sopped with moisture that it completed fell apart.  I ate it as I could.  The potatoes tasted like the ones you get in the can, the eggs were watery and the beans weren't there.  Someone behind the counter charged me extra but failed to follow through.  I will say that their tortilla with butter is good - but what ISN'T good when drenched in butter.  For good tortillas, go downtown to Glendale and go to La Purisima...don't waste your time with Carolinas."}
{"text":"Great mexican food, at a fair price and fast!  They are always helpful with their menu and patient as I look for something new to try.   I have never had a bad experience here.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best. Mexican Food. EVER!! A couple LA places are pretty good but still nothing like here. And nothing even comes close in AZ! Been trying for years to find somewhere that can rival Carolinas and so far just can't be done!"}
{"text":"I'm from South Texas where Mexican food flows like rivers of milk and honey. Been living in AZ a couple of years and have been on a mission to find the ultimate taste of Mexican food from home.  Boy, oh boy. My husband took me here one afternoon.  I ordered a green chile burrito. Let's just say that my husband kept talking and I had to tell him to stop talking to me because my food was so flavorful that I didn't want to waste my energy talking but instead focusing on the party of perfect blend of spices, juicy succulent gravy, warm fresh flour tortilla and the earthy flavor of green chiles going on in my mouth!  Amazing!    Yes. Yes. Yes. A definite treasure this place is."}
{"text":"Love all of the food here. The green corn tamales and green chili with beef are my favorite. Gotta try the salsa."}
{"text":"I think the bad reviews are missing the point of Carolina's. This is a home cooking style of casual restaurant. The rice and beans are just like nana makes. The tacos had real shredded beef and were overstuffed. The chips and salsa are fresh and made on site. It's not meant to be Abuelos or some other high end spot. It's genuine home cooking, fast, fresh, and cheap!  I think the number of people that were there for lunch today would also agree."}
{"text":"How anybody can complain about the food or service at this place makes me wonder about their sincerity. The joint across the street is ALWAYS empty so they may be a complainer. Not only is the food some of the best mexican at a fast food place (not a pick up but made to order) so you should expect to wait a while. As for the service, have you ever thought that you get what you give?. Try a smile and a pleasantry instead of grouching. We have been going to Peoria,s Carolinas since they opened and only once have I seen a male at the cash registers, it is always girls. I have never heard anyone be rude or abrasive to a customer. It makes a person wonder what the complainers expect, if you want waiter service, do you go to McDonalds?"}
{"text":"I ate at the Carolina's downtown for nearly 10 before I retired - at least once a week.  And traveled from the West Valley to get their food after that.  I was very pleased when they opened one in Peoria.  Their food is excellent -- best refried beans, which is my test of a good Mexican food place."}
{"text":"Incredible food!' Buy the tortillas to take home Wish it stayed open later!"}
{"text":"Service wasnt friendly.  Food not that great.  They dont have carne asada. No street tacos.   They are catering to the more American palate."}
{"text":"Lost my order got attitude major when asked after wait 30 minutes lol just for two burritos way to ruin my lunch thx."}
{"text":"This place used to be good.  I don't know what has happened recently but the food is always cold, and the orders are rarely correct.  Hope management gets their act together because I now have to find another favorite casual mexican food place."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. I ordered a dozen tortillas, half pint hot sauce and one buttered tortilla. My tortillas and hot sauce were ready in less than ten minutes she said they're waiting for the buttered tortilla. I heard the girl ask about the tortilla and once again they asked cooks in kitchen. People ordering huge meals AFTER me we're getting their orders left and right while I stand there and wait for one single buttered tortilla. I finally got fed up and told the young man and other lady that it was ridiculous that I'm still waiting for the one single tortilla. It's ashamed I had to get pissy with them before they finally made a consorted effort to get it.  Really??  Poor organization and customer service.  Food is good, but I recommend you don't ever order one single buttered tortilla because you'll be waiting forever."}
{"text":"My favorite place for a beef taco! They do it right! I really enjoy the food but the atmosphere is always busy and hectic which is probably not a bad thing for their business. I would give more stars if there cashiers put on a smile rather than rush you through the line to order, which is always long. I've been here several times and never have they been nice or look you in the eyes when you order."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some low cost Mexican food that tastes amazing.  Go early and grab a breakfast burrito.  Don't go in expecting a high class restaurant.   This place is not about the atmosphere...... here it is all about the food  Try their homemade tortillas"}
{"text":"This place has really good enchiladas.  When we went for the first time we were under the impression that this was a sit down restaurant..as in not fast food.  They make everything fresh, but it is a \"fast food\" atmosphere.  Since I am not from around here I was a little confused when I arrived and saw the building.  Since this was on the Phoenix top list of Mexican Restaurants I guess I expected something else.  But with all that said the food is very good.  I was just bummed I couldn't order a beer or margarita.  Next time I would just do take out and have my own beverage at home."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would.  Worst Mexican food I've ever had.  While ordering a carne asada burrito I asked what came on it... apparently only carne asada and pico... had to add guacamole.  The place seemed busy but now I have no clue why... the burrito was as small as a taco bell burrito and honestly taco bell tastes better!  The carne asada was dry and over seasoned and had a very small spoonful of guacamole and I got charged 90¢ for it.  Ridiculous.  I was still hungry after and that's never the case at real Mexican taco shops. I'll never go back.  I may be spoiled on San Diego taco shops but even Filbertos is a gazillion times better than this place... what a joke.  Oh I forgot to mention how annoying the lady was calling out orders... I'm disabled so it takes me longer than 3 seconds to walk up to pick up my tray she just kept yelling my order number out.  I don't understand why this place has so many good reviews.. these people obviously don't know what good Mexican food is."}
{"text":"Not enough stars to click on.  I dine at the one in Peoria and it' s always clean, staff is friendly and the food is amazing.  Portions are generous.  Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"The food is yummy!!!! Wait time can be lengthy so if your in a hurry not the place to go or do the call ahead."}
{"text":"Carolina's is amazing! Best Mexican food in Arizona! My wife and I come here at least once a week and the food is always delicious.  Sometimes they get crazy busy and it takes a while to get your food but that's because everybody knows the food is worth the wait! If you haven't gone here GO NOW! Your missing out"}
{"text":"I've been coming back year after year and I just love this wonderful friendly place.  l usually call in my order which are always ready when they say.  My wife loves the red burros, beans, rice and a taco to boot.  Myself, I gotta have there machacha w/f-tortilla wi beans & rice.  I don't know what they use to keep there flour tortillas so fresh for so long (there just great by themselves) I always buy a dozen or more for home use, there great to roll scrambled egg & sausage in and don't forget to buy extra hot sauce...oh boy is it good!    I'm retired and know good food when I eat it, and this is good mexican food!!"}
{"text":"I had a great first time experience with Carolina's Mexican Food. I needed to order catering for my office with a very short notice. Carolina's was able to fit my order in when they usually ask for a 24 hour notice and I gave them a 90 minute notice! When I arrived to pick up my platters the restaurant was BUSY!! The girl behind the counter greeted me promptly, chatted and joked with me while they were packing up my order ,then carried and placed the food in my car for me. I didn't have to lift a finger! I had ordered one chicken and one beef taco platter, a full tray of chicken enchiladas, and a full tray of rice and beans. This also included chips and salsa. Everything was delicious, everyone in the office enjoyed the food and went for seconds. I did not have any complaints and all my coworkers wanted to know where I ordered the food from... Thank you Carolina's for providing my office with great food under such a short notice, with friendly customer service. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went into Carolinas today with my family. We usually go a couple times a month. Well what a surprise they changed their menu completely. No more combination plates everything is ala carte. So essentially what they did is they substantially raised their prices. Very very disappointed for what they're charging now I should not be eating out of a styrofoam plate. They are charging what a sit-down restaurant charges not a take out place. The food is still good but it is no longer the value that it once was. I probably won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Carolina's has some of the best tortillas ever.  These were so good I brought 2 dozen to share with my family in Boston.  Sooo good.. I had my mom Fed Ex me some last week!"}
{"text":"Place lacks quality control.  Ordered the machaca combo, and it was completely void of flavor.  Please add salt...even the salsa was bland.  Come on, get it together."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the origin location for years...So, I was excited when they opened one on the West side of town. The first time we went the food was just as wonderful as the original location. We recently came back from a long trip away from home and was looking forward to some good Mexican food. We ordered enchiladas a side of beans...the beans were wonderful, but the enchiladas were horrible. They used to put them into a metal container and serve them smothered in enchilada sauce and melted cheese. I don't know if they were out of these containers or just trying something new but they served the enchiladas cold in a Styrofoam container. The cheese was unmelted, cold and really ruined our meal."}
{"text":"Great homemade tortillas but meat was bland. Needed to use outside sauces and salsa to flavor, but maybe that's deliberate. Floor needed to be swept a little but appeared very clean otherwise. Very casual/simple dining, almost like fast food. Not a sit-down and be served by a waiter place; you stand in line and your food is handed to you on a plastic tray. Other reviews I've read seemed to have been expecting a traditional sit-down restaurant and that's just not what this place is. It's very laid back but the food is real good."}
{"text":"Great food and close to my work. Haven't had a visit here without it being packed. They also sell their enchilada sauce here which I use everytime I make them for the family...sometimes cheating good lol."}
{"text":"Some of the best cheap, no frills Mexican food in Peoria. Their tortillas are next level, the beans & salsa are delicious, and you can't beat the price for a $4 burrito. The green machaca is an absolute must order!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. I was on the phone on hold for 10 minutes then someone finally answered back to me but had no  idea why I was on hold. Also they falsely advertise online their menu and when you tell them they still have to honor it they don't do so and say \"sorry that's the way it is\". I would not recommend  to anyone. There are so many Mexican food restaurants around that would be better then this one."}
{"text":"I love to come here in the morning and have tacos and get fresh made tortillas.  But service us starting to go down. There are some employees who avoid you when you ask for things and try to shove you off to ask somebody else. There are some still good employees but very few.  I would give more stars cause I like the food but the service needs to improve"}
{"text":"I went for 1st time and tried the red chile burro w rice and beans. I would say nothing special but not bad either. For sm reason it gave me gas for the rest of the day, but I would say \"meh\" to the food."}
{"text":"When it comes to their flour tortillas, this place is it.  I definitely stop here every other week to enjoy some great burritos and they are pretty authentic when it comes to their red and chile sauces.  Don't expect bacon and egg breakfast burrito's because that is not mexican, see filibertos."}
{"text":"My coworkers always insist on eating here as they say it is the best Mexican food in the valley. I always cringe as the food isn't bad but it certainly isn't worth going as often as they want to.  Food is very mediocre and doesn't have much flavor. There are much better places than Carolina's in my book."}
{"text":"Good food.  Reasonable price on most things.  I love beans and theirs are very good but a 4.00 bean burrito here is way over priced.  Especially for the small size and it being just an all around cheap food. So I drove around the corner to Del Taco for a 1/2 pound bean burrito for 99 cents just to fill up.  Lol."}
{"text":"reading these reviews is hilarious.   This is NOT abuelo's.. you're not going to find gourmet Mexican food here.  If you're from So Cal.. go home and eat. Mexican food is just as diverse as the languages and dialects that reside within Mexico. I grew in a border town. This is as close to THAT type of Mexican food as I have ever found, anywhere. The hot sauce.. not salsa..hot sauce is right on the money. If I had to guess, I'd have to attribute it to the use of Mexican oregano as opposed to oregano usually found in Italian dishes.  This is the best menudo that I have found anywhere. The red chile is fantastic. The green chile is awesome. I have never been disappointed.    I have seen it be a little dirty. They could be more diligent about wiping table and making sure that garbage bins get emptied. But nothing worse than you will see at any fast food place with high volume.    Yes, they do holler your order number out when it is ready.. and her voice cuts through that place like fingernails on a chalkboard... it's not abuelo's."}
{"text":"The family go-to when we have a big group to feed on a budget. This isn't really a dine-in place. The line snaking out the door is mostly take-out, but feel free to seat yourself after you get yout order and dine in.  They have meals with rice and beans or you can build your own. Don't go home without some fresh tortillas and guacamole.  The portions are generous and the food well prepared.   I wouldn't choose any other Mexican restaurant over Carolina's for any price."}
{"text":"Carolina's is the place to get the best Mexican food in the world.  Not kidding.  Their tortillas are second to none.  I always get at least a dozen tortillas to take home and some of their enchilada sauce as well.  My go-to is to get a bean burrito (sometimes double wrapped because the tortilla is the best part) and a couple of hard shredded beef tacos.  The taco sauce they make here is very good as well - but it can be a little too spicy for some people (not me!)  The only thing here that isn't too good is the cheese enchilada.  Stick with the burros and tacos.  I would eat here every day if I could... but then I'd weigh like 780 pounds and be dead by 45."}
{"text":"Unbelievable mix burrito, Menudo, and beef tacos. I am writing this review now as my mouth drouls for more delicious food from Carolina's."}
{"text":"The chicken is absolutely disgusting, they only have one method of cooking chicken and that's to boil. Never eat here or any of there other locations again. Hopefully the items on the menu is better."}
{"text":"Very dirty place, they need to take a deep cleaning to the whole place. Basically my girlfriend and I make better homemade tostadas and refried beans and rice then they do. The guy at the register was pretty rude. If you value your health then stay away from this place. I wonder what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"I remember the burritos being bigger and better. They're still good but not as good as before. They have become a little bit stingy here.  Also, every time I go here the horchata is always out or broken. SAD!  I want the old Carolina's back."}
{"text":"I have been to this Carolina's location as well as the Cave Creek location on dozens of occasions and this one is almost always unbearable.  The salsa dispensers are almost always empty.  The trash is always overflowing.  There is always food all over the floor and tables.  There are dirty rags left out on top of tables and trash cans.  And the ice machine is almost always empty.    I even took the time to write the manager about these unacceptable conditions after seeing them over and over and was replied with \"There was a new guy on the trash cans and a manager called out.\"  They obviously don't care about customer satisfaction or keeping a clean environment.    Looking at the other reviews I know I am not alone on this.  The Cave Creek and Cactus restaurant is just as busy but still manages to keep their salsa jugs full, ice full, trash taken out, and floors fairly clean.  I am okay with eating on paper plates and plastic untensils but I am not okay with eating at a dump.  The next time I return if it is in the same condition I am taking a picture and sending it to a health inspector.    Absolutely disgusting and unacceptable!"}
{"text":"best Mexican place in Peoria for sure! sucks they close in Sunday's! but so happy everyone there is super sweet & the burritos are the best hang over cure"}
{"text":"I have a huge party once a year. I usually have Carolina's make up the party platters. The mini chicken flautas are ok, need something more to spice them up. They stayed firm and not soggy. Unfortunately the mini beef chimichangas were so soggy, dark(like almost burnt) and very greasy. Not a nice presentation.  My order was ready and didn't have to wait half hour like last year. I would order the flautas again but will skip the chimi's."}
{"text":"I repent from coming here and waste my money on s h i t!!!  They should advertise as \"the best white-washed piece of s h i t junk in town\"  Carne asada tacos DO NOT have lettuce or cheddar cheese!!  Every day I get more convinced that white things will eat anything and call it great food.  So glad I'm not a gringo.  Ta'Carbón taquería on 43rd Ave have such great tacos that this place doesn't compare to them, not even 1% close!!!  The only reason people come here is because it's close to their house, otherwise I cannot see a real reason why would anyone decide to be fooled a second time. Only fools!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy stuff we get the green chili burrito and the shredded beef tacos. The hot sauce is also good. The food is 5 stats but these service is poor. It takes a long time to get your food. I would say 7 out of 10 this this has happened to us."}
{"text":"DIRTY ~~~DIRTY~~ DIRTY  called main ofc to tell em how dirty it was--they said it was a franchise - just using their name- never again"}
{"text":"It's ok , everybody raves of how great it is . They must not have really good Mexican food . If your not picky about your food or waiting 25 minutes to get it then this is your place."}
{"text":"I think I'm in trouble. A Carolina's 5 minutes from my office in Peoria. I didn't realize this was the same Carolina's as the restaurant in Downtown Phoenix until this week, so I introduced the delicious, affordable, Mexican fare to my coworker.   Compared to their original Phoenix location, this location is much more comfortable and clean. Although I appreciate the \"taco stand\" feel of the Phoenix location, the West restaurant is newer, cleaner, and a bit more welcoming.   I overdid it on the ordering. I over-ordered. I was so excited I couldn't help it! I tried the green corn tamale, a chicken enchilada, and a soft chicken taco. I ate half of everything and was stuffed and saved the rest for dinner. I enjoyed the tamale the most. The size was good too - I'm sure most would say it was a bit on the small size, but I liked that it wasn't huge. My coworker ordered the chips to start and they were awesome. The salsa isn't chunky, but it's spicy and delicious.   What else can I say?! Good cheap, fast, authentic Mexican food. If you're looking for a light, low-cal lunch, this isn't it.   I have to mention the tortillas. I ordered a dozen to take home. I didn't realize they were close to 18\" in diameter. I sure hope they freeze well. Carolina's claims they have the best tortillas - and I agree.   The only things I didn't care too much for is the excessive amount of Styrofoam used and the fact that my hair smelled like corn tortillas the rest of the day. :)    Simple, delicious, authentic. Carolina's will not disappoint."}
{"text":"So few days ago was my third time giving Carolina's a try and I live very close to it... Wasn't impressed the first time.... Nor the second time... Unfortunately the third time I was done wasn't all that great expected to sink my teeth into a delicious breakfast burrito and I had huge pieces of boiled potato not even fried... Tasteless... Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Here is the straight dope on Carolina's/Peoria:  If you are looking for super friendly service, keep looking. The service is inconsistent.  If you are looking for fast and competent, you will find it here most of the time.    If you are looking for a perfect order every time, keep walking.  If you take the time to thoroughly check your order, you will be satisfied, but you cannot be afraid to speak up. Sometimes they undercook the tacos which makes them seem stale.  The salsa is improved.  The chips are good. The beans and rice are yummy.   When it is super busy, you will not like most anything about it, but it is super busy because it is good food, so what do you want?  Also, they keep the AC on about 85 so be ready to sweat.   Now, the cleanliness issue.  There is an issue with cleanliness in the front of the house.  The back of the house seems to be kept much cleaner. For this reason, I get my food to go. I do NOT order beverages. The machines seem very unkempt and not maintained. I get the heeby jeebies just thinking about the bacteria in the ice maker and drink machines.    So that's my two cents."}
{"text":"I have been going to Carolina's for awhile now and it continues to be one of my favorite Mexican places. I have them on speed dial! The quality of their food is pretty excellent. They have a great menu as well. Lots of good stuff on the menu and everything is great! They are generous with their serving sizes and I am always full after one of the combo plates.  This place can get busy during lunch time hours but don't let that be intimidating or deter you from coming. They are really quick with getting food out and you can sit down to eat or take it to go in no time at all.  There is a ton of parking in the shopping center. They have an entrance on either side of the building.  I would highly recommend this place to everyone if they are craving some good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible!!!! Screwed up a order last week, called it in to replace it. Come in today to get my replace order then I have to pay for it! And then the food I ordered today they screw up on!!! Cassandra and Jesus seemed to be the ones in charge of the whole operation here and definitely don't seem to know how to operate a business or ensure great customer service to the people. Definitely will go out of my way to make sure people don't come here."}
{"text":"There are a couple of things that are mandatory in my opinion to qualify as a 5 star breakfast burrito.  1. The tortilla has to be fresh and soft. Carolina's are made on site. First box checked. Maybe double checked! 2. The accompanying red or green sauces have to stand apart for some reason. The red sauce here is as good as I've ever had. Heavy garlic and oregano seem to be the key factors. 3. The chorizo must be cooked correctly so you don't receive a pork fat facial when you take your first bite. Again, box checked!!!  Carolina's is an icon in the valley of the sun and you need to find any excuse necessary to make it in for a breakfast burrito. I'm sure everything else is great too."}
{"text":"My favorite guilty pleasure.   Order me the #9 and I've died and gone to heaven. Twice. (Once for each taco...)   Seriously yummy. Quick. Affordable. Clean. They do take credit cards...  And I haven't even mentioned their guacamole. Or their tortillas that some people drive from Paradise Valley and Scottsdale to get (people like this like to talk to you during their brief wait to get their order...).  The only downside to Carolina's is they are so CRAZY BUSY that getting a parking place or a table is sometimes a challenge (even though they offer plenty of both). Don't let this discourage you, though. Go a little early for the lunch/dinner rushes or take a bit of patience with you...you won't need much...they'll get you in and out with plenty of time to spare."}
{"text":"For Mexican food that taste like nana made it this is the go to spot. You won't be disappointed. I make sure to always bring new people here fora good \"home cooked\" meal, I'm vegan so not very many options but still worth the visit for my friends and co-workers to enjoy. Gets a bit busy during lunch but tables clear out kinda quick."}
{"text":"Went here the other day with the family, I had heard their food is great. I have got to quit listening to these folks!!! This place blows!! The food is very bland the chili sauce is more than mild. The tacos which I had were cold and tasteless, the enchilada sauce was more like mole sauce?? did not expect that. Beans were okay but that was about it oh I almost forgot the chorizo was pretty good other than that the folks who give this high marks obviously have never had real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, extremely salty salsa (and only one choice) and 25 minutes to get food in a \"fast casual\" setting.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok, everyone I know says the food is so good here.. People had me very much intrigued to try out this Mexican restaurant. It was crowded, good sign of good food right? Diverse crowd also told me that it was good food too. The cashier was very friendly and seemed overwhelmed by all the people in the line. I waited for a table and spoke with a couple who literally eats at this restaurant each time they drive in from Flagstaff as this is one of their favorite spots in the valley! Again, boosting my excitement for the food! So, after about twenty minutes of listening to the people announcing the number of the orders over the intercoms ( omg so flipping loud) that was ridiculous- they need to turn it down and teach etiquette to not yell into a microphone! Finally- my food is ready! I was surprised that my tamales had no meat! Like zip! I didn't even know what or how I ended up with tamales with literally corn in it?! I've never ever seen that in my life! The person I was with said how great the rice was- so I took a bite, and it was dry. I mixed the rice up with the beans and ta-da! Good! The beans were good and honestly the other meal on the table looked so much better than my vegetarian tamales! ( I didn't know that I ordered meatless tamales) However, three stars because Gesh apparently the tortillas are great, and I just didn't get to experience it. My suggestion is if you want some meat in your tamales, make sure you make it clear when you order otherwise it's corny!"}
{"text":"As I read other reviews about this place, I've come to realized that I might have ordered the wrong items because I was disappointed with my entire meal! I'm from the mecca of Mexican food (Southern California), so I know what good Mexican food is about!!!  My husband and I decided to take a trip over Valentines weekend to Arizona to check out the Dodger's spring training in Glendale. I told him that we had to try out Arizona's version of Mexican food so he asked a local to recommend a great Mexican restaurant and they told us about this joint.  I got the two tamale plate with red sauce and my husband got the carne asada burrito along with chips and salsa. I didn't enjoy the tamales because it had a weird taste to it and the burrito was dry. The beans were actually the best part of the meal. The salsa could have been a little better, but the chips did seem fresh and crispy. Yeah, the places is a little run down and not \"clean\" as others say, but that type of stuff doesn't really bother me."}
{"text":"First couple bites of the Taco Salad was delicious but as I got deeper in the bowl, it was a soggy, gross mess. Not the first time I experienced wet, semi-drained lettuce at Carolina's, but it is the last. Used to love this restaurant but I've noticed a change over the past year or so, and not for the better."}
{"text":"Be aware this place will charge your card for a tip if you don't pay attention. My family and I having been coming to this restaurant for years and I have always had a good experience that I was aware of, however when I looked at my card transaction from Friday January 13th, 2017 I notice they charged my card for $19.55 and my bill was only $16.55. On this day the place was packed, the place was super dirty (I can understand since they where busy but still have someone quickly wipe stuff down), and the cashier I had was not polite nor was she paying attention. She was more concerned with the cashier next to her and talking to him. Please be careful when paying with a card here. I am sure since I don't usually check my card transactions here that I may have been wrongly charged before too. This place in my opinion has gone down over time and the food is still good but everything else seems to be lacking."}
{"text":"The food is always awesome.  Best in the area.     The people behind the counter need to pull their heads out of their asses.  Don't be rude to me if I ask for an extra bag to carry my food.  I'd be happy to let the food drop to the floor for you to clean up."}
{"text":"Despite that the inside itself is a little rough around the edges I give them four stars because I've never ordered anything off the menu that wasn't delicious. It's a very casual place. I'm not sure I would even go as far as calling it a Resturuant, it's more so fast food type joint. So you can't expect all the bells and whistles.   What you can expect is good food and who cares about the rest as long as your appetite is satisfied! It's a busy location so the staff is always trying to do their best at keeping up with the line and getting orders out. I've even used their catering on two separate occasions and was still very pleased. So if you want some authentic Mexican food, I doubt Carolina's will disappoint. They don't always have a crowd for nothing!"}
{"text":"For the convenience and price this is always good option when you need to get your Mexican fix. The Red Chile is alway delicious. My favorite is the red, green, and bean properly named the Three Way Burrito. WARNING!! You must get this burrito double wrapped. If not, you WILL have a blowout and a big mess on your shirt, lap, or your plate if you're lucky. The beans are wonderfully smooth with a nice authentic pork flavor. Being a bit of a Mexican Rice (NOT Spanish Rice) connoisseur I can tell they use some of the broth in their rice from one of their simmering meats. Getting little bits of the mirepoix in the rice from the slow and low broth is a nice treat. The Red Beef Tamales are like Nana used to make. ¡magnífico! I recommend the enchilada style tamale if you really want to satisfy your taste buds. The Salsa is of course a staple in the valley and is no doubt tasty. I have noticed recently they've been using pre-shredded cheese instead of shredding it themselves. Oh well, everything else has been up to par so we'll continue to make this regular stop."}
{"text":"I like their food but it is getting to where I don't want to go. The inside of this place is disgustingly filthy!!! The garbage cans were running over, the area where the soda and salsa was was gross!! I tried so hard to not put any of my belongings down while I was waiting for my food. There was 3 registers but only 1 open and the line was growing. Not sure why the other 2 people behind the counter were doing food instead of having 1 do food and 1 do registers but hey, I am not the manager nor the owner. I will probably go back but not for a while and I hope they clean up!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night instead of our usual Caramba's because the hubby said he loved it. We have 4 children, two under two, so on a Saturday night around 6 pm is not the best time to visit.   After reading so many reviews of sub-par food and cleanliness I am feeling better about being underwhelmed when we visited.  We had two kids meals, a taco plate, and I got the green tamale and a carne asada taco, chips and salsa, and 6 flour tortillas to take home. My carne asada taco was ok. Not special by any means. My tamale on the other hand was really good. It was a good size, not skinny and small like others I have had, and was moist and full of flavor. The flour tortillas were also really good, I always love homemade tortillas. (Who doesn't?) The salsa was not good at all, I literally didn't eat any after tasting it. It was also dispensed out of weird containers near the soda machine. Very disappointing from a Mexican place that is supposed to be authentic! I make better at home!! I didn't get to try the other dishes with being busy with my two little ones just sitting in the booth because there were no high chairs.   Despite others reviews an the cleanliness issue, I think we will go back when we think it might be slower to give it one more try, but just based on this trip-- it is not half as good as Caramba's just down the street! ( We also spent at least $10 more!, more reason to go to Caramba's!)"}
{"text":"Honestly the 1st time I tried this place I hated it. Stated I was never going back. However my mom talked me into it.  Instead of a burrito I got the chicken hard shell tacos.  I love them, I order a #9 which comes with rice and beans.  Mom loves the enchiladas and tamales. Chips are goid too. You will have to pay for chips and salsa to go. You can get salsa out of the dispenser by the soda machine. Sometimes people are very messy and the staff is obviously that is a mess by the salsa. Cant really blame them, the are usually super busy. It is usually packed. Here is a tip....if you want your food faster.  Place a to go order via the phone. You pick up your food same place on orders do. Only you cut out waiting in line and longer for your food.   All in all good place."}
{"text":"MmmMMmMMMm  Enough said!  This place ROCK!  Although sometimes around dinner time it can get pretty crowed, its well worth fighting Juan to get to your Enchiladas :)    The GM of Carolina's is a great guy too!  Yummy, inexpensive, quality, Mexican food!"}
{"text":"The food in here is soooooooo good! The place does not look so appealing and always busy but hey the food is good"}
{"text":"Had heard people rave about this place so we finally tried it.  ABSOLUTELY THE WORSE MEXICAN FOOD I have ever eaten.   First the chips were cold and stale.  The sauce was overwhelming.  When our entres arrived, our enchiladas and tamales were swimming in that lukewarm sauce.  The beans were cold and the rice tasted funky.  Cashier surly!   Will never go back again.  I would have liked to have given negative stars for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Was recommended here by some friends. Food was great. Salsa was on point! Horchata was ok, not delicious but ok. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area on other business and decided to try this place out. The wife had heard about it and knew of one location in Tempe, I guess? So she was pretty excited to know that Carolinas was just a short drive away from where we happened to be. I have to admit being a little hesitant after seeing the pictures on Yelp (which didn't exactly make it out to be any sort of haute cuisine establishment), but then again if there's anything Juanitas III in Ontario, CA (look up my review of it) has taught me, it's that you should never judge a burrito joint by the cover. So in we went.  The kitchen and counter area were well-enough lit, I guess. Rest of the place was really dark. First thing we saw were flies buzzing around the counter and the staff seeming to not pay attention to them at all. Shitloads of corn chips in bags and a decent selection of Mex fare at acceptably low prices. I got the enchilada trio - beef, chicken and machaca. Wife got a burrito and a taco, and the kid got a mini bean burro.  We found a table amidst a good number of fat, happy Mexican (I assumed) patrons and sat down to wait for our number to be called. It was ready predictably quick and came with a bag of corn chips that I'd give about 70 on the corn chip scale, along with decently hot red and green salsa. I had asked for a side of jalapenos, which I got - but they were fresh, not pickled. I kinda wanted pickled, so my bad for not specifying that.  And then the food was ready. I was starving so I wolfed mine down. It wasn't too bad, but it wasn't a *gigantic* portion and to be perfectly honest it all tasted much the same, with the only differentiating factor being the texture of each protein. More corn chips went down the hatch. The kid liked his meal and finished the entire burro, most of the refried beans (a bean burro served with a side of beans. niiiice.) and most of the rice. I tried some rice and liked it, but it wasn't anything better than Knorr spanish rice that you could make at home. And the wife liked her meal. Not spectacular. Just regular, boring Mexican food that you could get anywhere. Though she DID go back and buy some tortillas, which I expect would taste exactly like store-bought Mission ones.  High points: Nothing particularly standout, really. It was edible, had flavour and several hours later I don't appear to be suffering any sort of Montezuma's revenge so there's a good chance none of my food was on the ground at any point before being served to me, as I often imagine to be the case with most other Mexican restaurants (which is why I eat at them so damn rarely). Good prices, $23 for a decent whack of food. Tomorrow morning I'm expecting to need to shit over a strainer so I can catch any stray intestines that might prolapse out, but I'm good so far this evening.  Low points: Flies. Dark and dingy interior. Being surreptitiously glanced at from time to time because I have a white wife. Or perhaps because we were speaking English. Who knows? And as for the patronage - Pita Jungle this ain't.  Anyway, the quest for a local alternative to Juanita's continues. Probably won't come back here, not because it was a horrible experience but simply because this quality of food is served at every single star-dot-Bertos in the Southwest and I don't need to drive all the way from Scottsdale to get it on the very VERY infrequent occasions I actually want it. In fact, I usually just go to Del Taco in those cases. Because they have fries!  Three stars, but.. yeah. I probably won't return (not their fault).  Edit: Well, it's the next day. And my morning poop didn't turn my balloon knot into a chrysanthemum (phew!), so we'll go ahead and leave this here review at three stars. Review concluded."}
{"text":"Awesome service!! Awesome food!! Awesome prices!! for the last 10 years this place has always hit the spot!! i used to go to the one in south phoenix but have started going to this one when i found out about it a year ago."}
{"text":"I guess I'm just spoiled from living in New Mexico my whole life (best mexican food EVER).  This place had been recommended to me by pretty much everyone when I told them I was looking for NM style Mexican food. We finally made it here & I was stoked! The girl behind the counter kept answering the phone while we were ordering, another worker was walking past us cursing at another employee...awwwwwkward. Now I'm willing to look past all of that IF the food is good, sadly disappointed doesn't even begin to cover it.    I ordered a carne asada chimichanga & my husband ordered the chorizo & potato combo plate.  The food came out quickly & my husband couldn't figure out what he was looking at on his plate.  It was just ground beef on top of mashed potatoes. Every place he's ever been has served it with fried potatoes & actual chorizo. Is this normal for AZ?  He didn't even want to eat it the food was so bland. I cut into my chimi & couldn't believe the meat that was coming out of it...boiled dry hamburger meat.  This was absolutely not carne asada. I gave it a shot thinking that at least if it's flavorful it won't matter. Nope. Bland, dry absolutely NO flavor. The guacamole on top was great & the tortilla wasn't heavy from being fried, it was nice & light.  But what's a chimi without yummy fillings?! I couldn't even finish it, we both had weird artificial aftertastes in our mouths as we were leaving. Blech. Sorry, but this is a huge \"never again\" for me."}
{"text":"One word!!!  Dirty!!!  I read the other reviews and thought maybe it was an off day!  OMG!!!  How hard is it to keep a place clean?  On the food side the tortillas and beans are awesome!  Rice is sub-par.  The red chili was also very tasty.  The prices are great!  This would be a much better place to eat if it were kept clean!!!  I took a friend for the first time this past weekend and boy was I embarrassed!  Won't be back there with so many other great Mexican options in the Valley!!!"}
{"text":"This is always our family original place to come and eat ever since we were kids no matter which location you go to it's delicious and great, the people are friendly in the service is fast"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Mexican food in Phoenix. The salsa is amazing and their Carne Asada burritos are the best!"}
{"text":"Good food small portions though. Pretty much always busy so you have to stalk for a table. It does take awhile for your food to arrive but as long as you're with good company it's all good. I always go when I'm in the area and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Gave them one star because this was our third time to this location and every time we've had very long wait times. Tonight was ridiculous. It took us 20 minutes to get there and 30 minutes to get 6 tacos. Really? I finally told my Husband to get the money back and we'll go to Taco Bell. I'm NEVER going to this location again. We'll go even more out of the way to go the original location during the day. This place sucks"}
{"text":"Carolina food is always consistent. But just a word of warning. When you get a take out order, double check it before you go. My last two orders were short. They will not do anything about it unless you drive all the way back and bring your card. The manager was no help what so ever. So Carolinas if you are reading this the manager on Wed May 24 tel your manager to work on his customer service skills."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, popular with the older community. Service is hit and miss. Not a fan of the salsa, very tomatoey not enough kick."}
{"text":"Highly recommended by coworkers and gave it a try. It did not blow me away. I tried the chicken green chili and it was good but not like I have to eat another one right away. Chicken seemed to be boiled and then slapped some green chill sauce on it.The place was packed and had to wait about 10min for an order to go. Still not a bad wait time.  I will return and try something else and see what all the hype is, or if thats all it is HYPE.."}
{"text":"Great food for a small chain. Tortillas used for tacos are delicious. Highly recommended and not expensive."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered to go. I had a bean burrito deep fried enchilada style she got a red Chile burrito the same way as mine. Neither one of cared for the enchilada sauce at all. It ruined both of our meals. The only thing that we both really loved was the chips. Very disappointed might go back for just the chips and flower tortillas I will stick to PoPo's."}
{"text":"No frills Mexican food. Nothing gourmet, nothing fancy, just tasty food at a good price. It's often crowded but if you're taking it home, phone in the order. You'll be in and out in minutes.   My only issue is that they are closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Best tortillas in the valley, food is fantastic. Ignore the haters here, try this place.  It's true that the presentation isn't chef quality, but it's not expected to be.  The portions may not be to your liking, and if that's the case you are most likely morbidly obese and need to control your appetite before you have a cardiac arrest.  If your thoughts are that \"there isn't much flavor\" then go eat Top Ramen or something because you don't know Mexican food.  This place is exactly what Mexican food is meant to be. Simple, spicy, filling and HOT. The folks behind the counter are pleasant, the operation is efficient and the food is really good."}
{"text":"This is real Mexican food. I had the #1 combination, chicken enchilada and beef taco. A nice spicy sauce on the enchilada, bit of a kick to it."}
{"text":"Been a fan for years! Always good and cheap! Big portions too! #10 green with chicken is the best. Green tamales are excellent!"}
{"text":"Compared to the similarly set up Caramba's, this place almost rocked my world. The price, the vibe, the food-all of the above.  I met a girlfriend from high school here for dinner at her suggestion and since I love Mexican food and had such a lame experience at Caramba's I jumped at the chance. I ordered my typical test drive meal at a new place. 2 crunchy tacos one shredded beef, one shredded chicken with refried beans, rice and a small side of guacamole. Our food was ready quickly, and my tacos were wonderful. Both of them were great as was the just fried little grease dripping taco shell. The beans were tasty and the rice was great and luckily had no carrots or peas. The guacamole was average.   This is not fine dining. This is not fancy. This is really good freshly made food and I will be back hopefully next month when I am back in town."}
{"text":"My first thought when I walked in this summer was: \"5,000 flies can't be wrong.\" I was grossed out a little by the number of our flying friends but I gotta say, that's what your second hand is for - SHOO EM AWAY!  This food is some of the best Mexican food I've had. They make homemade tortillas, and chips, and tamales, and, well..EVERYTHING!   I love their shredded beef chimichanga, and their refried beans are to die for. Everything, actually, is terrific here. The FLAVORS are incredioble, the meat spicy and frangrant - the beans creamy and rich. Oh, it's like the Mexican Food equivalent of hearing Colin Firth swear undying love in \"Pride and Prejudice\"...you never tire of it.....well, except maybe the flies....  We make the drive to Carolina's because it's great and we always take someting home \"For later\" like chips or tortillas. Their homemade goodness can NOT be beat by any other \"quick mex\" place. Carolina's kicks the ass of all the \"Ass Burrito\" places in the Valley - (and you know who you are- all you \"BERTO\" places!!)  The only thinkg I would recommend to our friends at Carolina's is perhaps a fly strip or two."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite go tos. Totally worth the wait! Green cheese enchiladas are my favorite. Oaxaca special is bomb.com and their guac and chips are also fantastic. Grab extra salsa because you'll want more later."}
{"text":"We were there on Saturday, March 4th for lunch. Lots of hype, but it was just okay. You should try it, I'm not saying don't go there, but expect to wait past the point where your stomach finally stops growling and just passes out. The line was long, the wait for food was long, and the food was good, but not worth the hype and the wait. I'd like to try it again when it isn't so crowded! But I get it -- if it's crowded, it's good...something MUST be good for people to wait in line to eat in and for those waiting to pick up their takeout order. We must not have ordered the THING that everyone was waiting for. Maybe better staffing would help move things along!  On a side note, thanks to the Girl Scouts who were there that day and provided our dessert for the afternoon!"}
{"text":"Sorry but once again I don't get it. This is a nice place, salsa out of pumps....oh you fancy huh. This is within walking distance from the new pad. I went against my better judgement.....kicking and screaming mind you. Decided to give this place another go or 5....maybe this location is better? The first time we tried it they were closed, the second time we barely made it. No carne asada? No chile relleno? Why God why must you toy with me?!?!? This place is NOT the best place.....the green sauce isn't green at all it's GREY people!!! You know what makes it that color? Flour.....more like gravy. You like the tortillas I could care less really its a super large thin tortilla there's nothing special about it. CALM DOWN. The kid behind the counter tells me to try the breakfast thats their specialty. My 3rd Carolinas attempt was for breakfast and once again I was very underwhelmed. I have tried basically everything on the menu all this stuff is pretty basic and a major let down. The rice and beans are good fyi."}
{"text":"How Good Depends On What You Order.   I have been to Carolina's a few times.  The food at Carolona's is hit or miss and the quality really depends on what you order.  Once inside you walk up to the  order windows  and select your entrée from a large menu.    As you wait for your entree to arrive you can hear staff calling out order numbers. Once our number was called we made our way up front grabbed our plates and asked for some salsa, that is  available in small paper cups filled by big stainless steel dispensers.  The hard-shell machaca burrito, rice and beans, horchata and tortillas were just okay. However, I found the cheese enchiladas to be mediocre (tortillas are hard, very little cheese).  The meal just wasn't very good.  It might be a while before I decide to re-visit Carolina's."}
{"text":"The food here is good. However this is more of a fast food atmosphere. Each item is ordered separately as well."}
{"text":"Service was great! We have never been there before and the cashier was very patient with us. Which I greatly appreciated.   Tortilla chips were gQuesadilla was good, guacamole wasn't to bad nice and spicy. Nothing to special about the place but if I'm in that area I will make sure to make a pit stop and visit them."}
{"text":"3 way burrito ($3.25).. not only is the name a whole lot of fun but it tastes awesome! Red chile, green chile and beans wrapped in one of their killer tortillas.. smooth, tender, creamy and delicious. Make it a foot long ($.90)and now were talking! Pair it up with their salsa and you're in for some great Mexican goodness!  I mentioned the tortillas but I REALLY need to mention them again, they are fucking kick ass! Stretchy while tender with a slightly smokey char taste, this is about as perfect as a tortilla can get. Because they were so messed up with our order the manager gave us a free dozen.. they were just made too, hot and steamy in the plastic bag. I couldn't wait and ate one immediately.. my gawd, great Mexican experience.   I love you Carolina, will you marry me?"}
{"text":"I love this place....the staff is very had working.  Prices are great and food is wonderful.  Love the green chili chicken burro enchilada style...doesn't get better than that.  Best bet is to get it to go and have it with your own beer."}
{"text":"Let me explain why this place deserves no more than 3 stars:  They shout customer orders over a loud speaker like you are getting a wake-up call via the 1MC on a US Navy ship.  No, that is not a good thing!  Plus, it is crowded, packed, and very loud.  People seem to come here for the cheap food ($5-6 per order), but you get what you pay for.  Carolina's West personnel throw bland food in a styrofoam carton and expect you to be content with some various combinations of lettuce, beans, cheese, and tortillas.  The taste is totally bland.  Abuelos, which is just a couple miles to the north, is a much better option for Mexican food.  Don't say that I didn't warn you!!!"}
{"text":"Carolina's West is as every bit as good as the original Carolina's! Including the price for the amount of food you get, and you can actually find a parking spot at this location...  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they had a west side location, especially after trying the original spot. I questioned myself if the food was really that good for how far I'd have to drive. The answer was a resounding YES, and I almost flipped a table over when I discovered Carolina's accommodated the west side! Yay!"}
{"text":"This is purely the best Mexican FOOD in Phoenix if you ask me.  Extremely authentic and the menu has plenty of classic options.   There is literally nothing bad here.  Prices are great as well.  You can buy menudo to go, fresh tortillas by the dozen, raw chorizo to make at home, etc etc.  There is often a long line here for a reason.  I would highly encourage anyone to eat here.  You will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I stopped on way home to pick up dinner yesterday after a pretty bad day. Bought tortillas, and quarts of hot sauce, green chile, machaca and beans. I had everything in a box. As I went to put everything in my truck, it all spilled in the parking lot. Instead of crying, I went inside to ask for something to clean up the mess I created. They cleaned up the mess and replaced all of the food I dropped without charging me. They did not have to do this and I was very grateful since it was my mistake. Not only is their food some of the best Mexican food in town, their staff and management are awesome. Thank you CAROLINA'S for making my day!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's obvious that everyone that walks in the door here loves it. This is one of three Carolina's in the Phoenix metro.  I've wanting to try the original Carolina's near downtown but did not want to drive all the way down to \"da ghetto\" all \"gangsta like\" to eat some fast Mexican food.  I have been to both North and West locations and found them to be very good and consistent.    After standing in line to order like at a \"taco stand\" I sat down and noticed all the dishes coming out of the kitchen, and I started to almost drool.  Then my number was called and the funny urge to yell BINGO, but rather went up to the counter to get my piping hot Machaca Burrito with Papas and a side of chips and spicy salsa (served in styro-foam, ARGUE!!). While the salsa heat was almost too much for my taste buds, it was simply delicious and even took some home.   Holy cow, this was amazing for the price.  As so many others have mentioned their tortillas are simply delish!! The beans were a good consistency, not too runny, not to dry and the rice had a great flavor.  Again the food is a great value for the price.  In summary, despite that fact this place is NOT eco-friendly by using stryo-foam it is more over a place that is convenient off the 101 and Peoria if you're in the area looking for good, fast Mexican food. This is not necessarily a destination place to plan for but rather a place of convenience with tasty food."}
{"text":"I don't get it. Everyone raves about this place but, what I had was flavorless. Sure, the tortillas are good but, that's not enough to make me want to come back. Maybe I just selected wrong. I had the Carne Asada breakfast burrito. The eggs tasted like the were reconstituted from powder and the steak was tasteless. Seasoning...heard of it? But if you like it, I'm happy for you. :-)"}
{"text":"If you don't know how authentic Mexican food should taste like and want something better than all the \"Betos\" then this is an edible place to grab something fast."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite places to get huge tortillas and sauce done for get a pint of their sauce the service is slow at times but that's because they have so many orders. Get in early before Christmas for the fresh tortillas. The staff are nice and polite clean bathrooms and tables."}
{"text":"Eh... I got a 2 chicken enchiladas. It was 8+ $$ I didn't get a drink with that. The rice and beans were quiet small. The beans are runny. There was barely any salt in the food.  Sorry filebertos gotcha by 3 1/2 stars... Compared to this for me"}
{"text":"Green Machaca Burro... The best in the business. I love this place because of the great food and very reasonable prices. The lines are usually pretty long so calling ahead will save you a bunch of time. Regardless, it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Be prepared for lines, a wait, and limited seating.   They get mucho -busy.  If you are a environmental evangelist, greenie, or sustainable.....you will panic when you see how the food is served..  Why?  All the food is served in styrofoam.  This becomes quite complicated when one tries to eat as the space is very limited and the containers consumer space.  I am picky about cleanliness and found that many of the other reviews were exaggerated.  Keep in mind, this place is a inexpensive fast food spot, it is not the Hotel Del Coronado.    Refried beans, in my mind, define a Mexican spot.  5 stars for their refried beans.    Tamales were great and fresh.  Tortillas are the size of a round man hole cover.  I had the mini chimis which were awesome and worth the $6.00.  I got robbed on my portion of the beans.  Still good.  :)  Ordered several items for the wife to try - all were a hit.  One does get nickel and dimed on tortilla chips.  As I have written before, anyone who spends $25 on fast Mexican food is entitled to as many chips and salsas as they want and they should not come at an additional cost.  If you try it, you will like it.  Just be mentally prepared for lines, styrofoam containers, and some dude complaining about the wait.  Chill that guy."}
{"text":"I have been driving past this place for 5 years now, ever since I moved to Phoenix and finally decided to try it. the restaurant was clean and the employees were very friendly.all of the good was great, we had beef enchiladas, tamales, and even a chimichanga. My family and I are looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Carolinas for years. They have revamped the menu and no longer have the authentic corn taco shells I loved. They have been replaced with store bought hard small shells. Basically they are like Taco Bell with much higher prices!!! Goodbye my old faithful place no longer my cup of tea. Very disappointed. I think this will sink your business"}
{"text":"Prepare to wait a long time!  The burritos are good but that's about it.  The rest is just mediocre."}
{"text":"Good mexican fast food. The prices are great and staff is courtesy. Always packed so you may need to wait but not for long."}
{"text":"I am a Mexican American and growing up all my mother cooked was traditional mexican food. It is rare that I will go out to eat at a Mexican restaurant and enjoy my meal. I have tried enchiladas, beef crunchy tacos, red tamales and the beef green chile with their amazing tortillas. Will definitely go back there."}
{"text":"I was meaning to try this place some time ago and I finally have gotten to lunch here on a couple of occasions.   My first trip I had a shredded beef taco with a cheese enchilada combo with rice and beans ($5.15 with a drink, $1.15)  Very good.  On my second  trip I pigged and had an Oaxaca special burrito with mild chorizo, beans, potatoes, cheese and smothered with cheese and green enchilada sauce and a side of beans and rice ($7.25).  Everything I had was good.  They have a person assigned full time to keeping the dining and drink area cleaned and even then the lunch rush has him falling behind keeping tables ready.  This is a local family run chain of 3 locations with a lot of history in the valley.  Their tortillas made in house are really good.  While some may complain there is not a salsa bar or that the chips have a price tag on them their pricing structure has a lot of merit in that you can order what you want and pay only for that and nothing you may not wish to consume.  In that sense it can be a really inexpensive place to eat.  While I would not consider this a destination place it is certainly a good value if you are in the area.  And based on the crowds that fill the place I am not alone in that idea."}
{"text":"Are you craving your nana's red chile with fresh tortillas but she happens to be maybe in another state!!!! Well here is some good news, out here in the valley, we have Carolinas!   I was craving a red chile burro with some beans, I mean really craving it and I was out on the west side and knew where I had to stop!  That's right, Carolinas! Oh yea!  Ordered a red chile & beans burro & shredded beef taco, let me tell you, it was delish!!  They also offer a 3 way baby!!! Clean up your mind son, we are still talking food, it's a red chile, green chile and bean burro,,,that right there is burrito bliss I tell ya!  Was sad when the burro was gone, but my craving was satisfied, looking forward to the next time!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, thank goodness we got there before 8:30pm.  They close at 8:30pm!  It was packed at 8:10pm!!!!  It smells so good.  I got the beef chimi with sour cream, 2 beef flautas, and 1 butter tortilla.  Everything was GREAT!  So happy to have Carolinas on the west side!"}
{"text":"They have the worst customer service and organization.  Called ahead for order.  Arrived and paid for it said they would call me when ready, assuming few minutes.  Fifteen minutes later people coming in and ordering after I paid got there food.  When I could get someone's attention and asked about my order it was just sitting there.  No apologies or anything.  40 minutes even after calling ahead is bad.  This is not the first time but will be the last....."}
{"text":"Place was packed when I showed up. Which made me excited for my lunch. Unfortunatly very bland. Your gonna need seasoning. And their chocolate chimis are just deep fryed chocolate chips wrapped and fryed. Way to much chocolate. Chocolate chips were not even melted. Apple chimis filling is from a can u can taste it.  Place is ok but definitely no need for me to go back. Too many good Mexican places around."}
{"text":"Carolina's is our go to spot when we want good Mexican food. They always have friendly people that greet you and take your order. The menu has a lot of options or you can go a la carte. We typically stick with the combos. You tend to get good portions and good deal. And they do catering which is nice if you have want to have a celebration. The only downside is there have been a few mistakes made on orders over the years. But the staff is quick to remedy the problem and in some cases have even given up free food. So far, I have not found another place that compares."}
{"text":"First and last time here. Ordered tamales red chile and beef or should I say a speck of chile and a nickle size amount of beef a dozen for $28.81 yes... that was disgustingly expensive. This place is not mexican and it is over priced  and flavorless, I'm  certain it is frozen microwaved food and the staff is very unfriendly and rude the place is dirty. Don't risk it if you love Mexican food it's not worth it a total embarrassment to Mexican food. Wish I can give them a speck of a star like they did to the beef."}
{"text":"First off the food is not that great. The staff working there is what really sets them to the lowest you can be. At work we often do a group order for lunch or dinner here and tonight they messed up giving us the incorrect item. I called to explain this as I couldn't eat what was given to me. The girl proceeded to tell me I have to bring it back or they won't do anything for me. They close in 10 minutes and I'm at work. I don't have time to drive there within 10 minutes let alone leave work again. She then proceeds to tell me that I got what was on the order and she's not going to do anything for me, in a rude, snobby attitude. I'm pretty mad at this point because what I got was not what I ordered. I ask for a Manager and I'm told there isn't one available. The girls name was Cavina Munoz that I spoke to. I will be down there tomorrow with the day old food that wasn't eaten. Hopefully the Management is better then the employees. Don't go here if you expect good service."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican food restaurants in Phoenix. Carolinas is great for breakfast and lunch. If you want to splurge get some hand made tortillas to take home. #3 is a favorite pf mine. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place was good, but not as great as others are making it out to be... I've had better in the West Valley, East Valley, and down south in Tucson. It wasn't very busy when we went, I mean we got our food pretty quick despite the amount of people and a rather large family that was there too.  The food was under seasoned, and the drink and condiment station was a huge mess. I ordered enchiladas as I opted out of the tamales, originally we had wanted to order the Menudo, but they only served it in the mornings of Saturday (we were here on Saturday night) so... hm. Not a fan."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos were amazing. I didn't take a close look at what they were filled with but it was much more than the regular cilantro and onions... a much enjoyed surprise. The menudo (I ordered red) was pretty good but it could have had more red chile but good nonetheless.  The chimichanga was Very good... Next time I'll order it with a sauce but good even without it."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Nothing amazing and the portions on things like the Chorizo burrito can leave you wondering if there is a tasty meat shortage you are unaware of...But the tortillas are damn good. The Enchiladas are my usual go to here and the salsa is pretty good.   All n' all I am glad it's in the neighborhood but it's not one of those amazing spots you must try. Plus them being closed on Sundays often makes them a miss for me overall."}
{"text":"Killer Mexican food. Always good and definitely not overly greasy. They make their own tortillas. The red choke burrito enchilada style is my favorite."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican food place.  They serve you fast.  I highly recommend the #15 special.  Ask for some spices on the side.  And don't forget to get a drink on the side because the have Mexican drink machine so if you're feeling adventurous you can get flavored horchatas and juices with free refills.  It sounds like I work there but it's just Cuz I eat there so often.  I absolutely love Carolinas!"}
{"text":"Do all the cool kids hang out here? Yea they do!   Once again Carolina's has won my heart with her fantastic tortilla's, once you have one you will be disappointed with any other! Both locations I have visited offer stellar tortillas! Thanks for being consistent!   I had my usual Machaca (shredded beef with onions, chilies & spices) Burrito with Papas (potatoes) :P You gotta try one the beef is tender and juicy but not sloppy wet. It is seasoned to perfection with just a mild heat. The potatoes just add another dimension of deliciousness!  My friend had the chicken burrito I tried it but did care for it. The chicken is a mix of white and dark meat and it was on the dry side. She put a ton of hot sauce on it. Also she said she thought it may be better mixed with beans and cheese.   I will see you soon Carolina!"}
{"text":"Good food. Piss poor service. Good aweful takeout.  If you want a place to come in, get good food and sit and eat for a few, then this is fantastic. It's a great place to get something you crave and it'll hit the spot.   Don't ever order an anything to go, and not check your food. The people putting things together couldn't care less what's been ordered. Every takeout order is wrong, every time.  Nothing worse than driving to get food you crave, seeing it looks f*ing delicious, and then finding the one damn thing you don't want in your burrito.   Who the fuck puts tomatoes in everything... and why?  They're mushy and cold. They don't belong in my kick ass taco or burrito. Especially when I said \"Don't Put Tomatoes In\".  That said, they're good.  Don't knock it till' you try it."}
{"text":"Carolina's West is not only friendly, but their food is incredible! My usual is the red and bean burrito, enchilada style. Their red chili is rich with chunks of beef, combine that with their delicious beans wrapped in a tortilla that's large enough to be a baby blanket topped with enchilada sauce, cheese and scallions, and you have a meal that good enough to slap your nana over! Carolina's West, a happy, family environment that once you experience it, you'll keep coming back over and over again. Tell Gina and Anna that I sent you."}
{"text":"I've definitely had better.  The food was good, but nothing I'd go back for.  I enjoyed the food at the little hole-in-the-wall across the street (Taqueria Los Angeles)  far more.  There was no comparison.    I ordered a couple machaca soft tacos and a chimichanga.  They were busy, but not overwhelmed.  It took 25 minutes to get my food.  People were getting a bit testy and a couple made a scene about the slow service.   I think the tortillas would have been good, but the tacos were so wet, I couldn't pick them up without them falling apart.  The machaca was bland until I doused them with salsa... that I had to ask for.     The chimichanga was good... loaded with the machaca beef.  It was still a bit bland though, but salsa helped.  I don't know if I'll go back."}
{"text":"once fazoli's, now turned into mexican restaurant..  i wanted to try the place... but mexican food is so common around here.. so it is nothing special to me.. besides.. they taste pretty much the same.. right? well.. no..  i walked in.. long line of people waiting to order..  i stared at the menu.. and so much to choose from..  everything sounded so good..    i ended up ordering enchilada combo plate..  did i mention they have different selection of fountain drinks with mexican juices? everything about the place felt pretty authentic..  they make their own tortillas, chips, and everything else they serve.. you can taste the difference..  saw lot of hispanic people eating.. which shows their food is traditional and authentic.     only thing i don't like..  they close at 8:30pm and closed on sundays.. bummer.."}
{"text":"I was kinda disappointed.  Came to have dinner on a Friday night and they had no chips. Food came out quick and was cold. The staff seemed more worried about going home then good customer service. Food was bland and I will not be back to this place. Not to mention they were closing down the dining area at 8pm. So while we ate our cold food we had to listen to chairs being moved around, trash cans being cleaned and covered 8 feet away from us and how can I forget the Mexican lady in the kitchen screaming and yelling something.  I don't speak Spanish so I couldnt help her with whatever she was squawking about. Sad"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I have never been to the Carolina's downtown, so this was my first experience with the place. I had some friends raving about their tortillas and talking about how they are the only ones they will use anymore, so of course my interest was peaked.  This combined with all the rave reviews and me and the husband decided to take the short trip this past Wednesday.  The locations was clean, and the employees were polite. The menu is extensive so I caved and went with the number 9 since it had rave reviews in a previous review. The beans and rice were very tasty and the tacos tasted better than any other \"taco stand\" joint I have been to and best of all were not loaded with grease. The tortillas used in the tacos were thin and crunchy and boy did the NOT skip on the cheese. The husband ordered a chimichunga and he was pleased to find out  that it was only chicken inside (he has texture issues with onions and chilis) and he was over the moon with the \"non chunky\" salsa with a good kick to it. We tried a cheese tortilla (once again not super greasy at all) and a buttered tortilla. Next time we would do either a cheese tortilla or the chips, not both. We really did end up over ordering but for under $20 and lunch for the hubs the next day we really couldn't complain.  We will be back, soon I hope. This is definitely on the guilty pleasure list."}
{"text":"Great authentic food havent had good mexican food like this in a very long time, great flavor, had the taquitos and loved everything about the food  A+"}
{"text":"If you need a fast lunch this place is OK however the tacos are pretty bland and the cheese might as well be Kraft. For $2.25 a taco I expect something far better then shredded iceberg lettuce, chicken and Kraft. But this area doesn't have many options so it could be worse. It won't kill you, but the tacos are nothing to write home about.   The actual tortillas are good but what's in the middle isn't that great..."}
{"text":"My family ordered a green chili burro meal and a carme asada burro and I wasn't overly impressed. The food was average but under seasoned, especially salt. The green chili wasn't too spicy and needed more acidity because I didn't taste any lime either. I probably wouldn't go back here but my mom enjoys their food so we may try it again just in case it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"The lines alone should show you how amazing the food is at this restaurant! My family loves to eat here. The food comes out and is served in a styrofoam containers which is a let down but do not let that fool you, because the taste is spicy! They have amazing different salsas to taste as well. Do not pass up on desert either, they have the best!"}
{"text":"Dicey to review a mexican food stop in Phoenix.  It's like trying to determine the best painting by Andy Warhol - subjective all the way and chances are you will find plenty of people who think his work is crap.  Authentic?  who the hell knows?    For me, I found a menu item I love and can eat it all day long here.  Have tried to recreate the taste at other establishments and haven't for twice the price or more.    So, Carolina's serves a purpose for me.  An infrequent indulgence of my favorite burrito and consistently prepared.  Peace"}
{"text":"My first visit and I've not tasted it yet however, my order was wrong from the start. We specifically stated plain no cheese or lettuce or anything just flautas. Our order came up and they were covered in cheese and guacamole.  They forgot our chips so we had to do another separate transaction.  I hope the food is good because I'm already over it."}
{"text":"First I want to say, I absolutely LOVE your food!!! It's amazing and the staff is phenomenal! Carolinas is my go to place every time I'm craving Mexican food because you guys know exactly how to do it! The one and only reason I am giving 4 stars is because of this one incident today. The first time I've ever had even the slightest issue. I bit into my delicious amazing burrito and was stabbed in the mouth by something that I've discovered is one of those goat head thorns that grow outside. I don't want to jump to conclusions, I'm just not exactly sure how one of those things ended up in my burrito and it definitely didn't feel very good stabbing me in the gums. I know this is just a one time mistake and I'm not holding it against you guys, but I definitely think it's something you might want to look into. Maybe just a little clarity on how it ended up in my burrito?"}
{"text":"Love this place and couldn't wait for it to open. It was previously a Fazzoli location and the decor didn't change when Carolina's moved in. The menu is awesome. The menu got better. No matter what you order with menu numbers or ala carte, your food comes hot and delicious.  No speedy drive thru, their lobby is so busy  they closed it, to focus on customers face to face It's family owned and a freat place to fill up."}
{"text":"I am so excited to see Carolina's in the West Valley. There are not many places that I can enjoy Mexican food on my side of town and the price is right. You can tell by the long lines that we have been needing it for a while. Get there early on Saturday for Menudo cause they are usually out by 9:30."}
{"text":"I went back last night and I noticed that the menu was adjusted again to include the original combo plates back onto the menu."}
{"text":"I am tempted to give 5 stars because they have good prices. In terms of food I'd say that their tortillas are good it's what makes their burritos worth eating. Their machaca burrito was good, their red chili burrito was good, but I wasn't a fan of the green chili burrito.   I can't recall ever having a green chili burrito that was as gelatinous, it was almost like a gravy which in itself isn't bad - but is when it's more gravy than meat. I'd say it's more of a gravy burrito then green chili burrito. My idea of green chili burrito is one you'd get at St. Mary's tortilla factory in Tucson (which also has way better red chili burritos too lol but I digress).  All I've eaten are the burritos here which I would say overall are good. While their prices are good it's not mega cheap...just cheap..because I eat quite a bit and I need 2 burritos to make a dent while in Tucson I can go to BK's and get full off one and it's about the same price. But still it's priced very reasonably (I lived in california for a bit and I'd say these sized burritos would be like 6 bucks while a burrito like one at BKs might be 9.50)  I shall update when I have the litmus test - carne asada. I don't expect it to be as good as BKs because I don't smell mesquite grilling the meat but maybe they use good spices - keeping an open mind lol."}
{"text":"Very casual and everything is ridiculously cheap and flavorful. Best fast food Mexican bar none. Closed Sundays!"}
{"text":"Such good food! Always stop there once or twice when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Way over rated. Did not enjoy anything about the place. Sloppy presentation and very little food. Never again."}
{"text":"Food taste amazing so you'll have to wait in line. The portion size for the rice and beans was a disappointment. Paid for a adult meal and received a children's portion"}
{"text":"I have grow up in Arizona with Mexican food and this place is THE BOMB!!  I am very picky when it comes to my Mexican food (No one can compare to my Nana, God rest her soul)  I am addicted to their hot sauce.  You have to take some tortillas home with you or you will have to drive back just for them.   It is like fast food there, food served in Styrofoam and plastic silverware so if you can get over that you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! The food is excellent and the workers are so nice. I always get the same thing, the Oaxaca burrito which is amazing and a taco which is also really good, hence why I get the same thing every time lol. I've also tried the red & green chili which are really good too. I have nothing bad to say about this place just go and try it NOW!"}
{"text":"Tamales were good. Prices good. Fast service. I would get the tamales again but without the sauce as it took over the flavor"}
{"text":"Mmmm, mmm! That's all I gotta say.  Okay, maybe I have a little more to say, like just try the double-wrapped beef enchiladas (#12), and you may be ruined for anything else on the menu.  While my family prefers the machaca beef burrito, I am hopelessly devoted to order #12.  Devine as well.  It's arguably the best mexican food in Phoenix. Seriously.  I only give it four stars because I haven't tried anything else yet."}
{"text":"This place is gross.... Taco salad came out runny from all the juice from machaca beef. Tasted terrible too. Had to pour out so much liquid got sick looking at it. Bad stomach ache after eating there! Asked for 1 taco salad no shell, and one with shell both came without. Forgot our bag of chips and salsa. Why do we pay for chips and salsa when the salsa is free??? I won't ever go back!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is just as good as it's original location in South Phoenix.  With that said I would rate Carolina's as the best fast food Mexican eatery in the Phoenix metro.  You really can't get any better than this, you can try, but I doubt you will.  The location for the West Valley isn't bad right off of the 101 and Peoria Avenue.  Pretty centrally located considering the area.  The place is always clean, the workers are very friendly and add to a welcoming experience.  You really can't beat the prices for the quality that you're getting.  The place is always busy and I can totally see why.  Serving very tasty food at a low price.  What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"It's always fun coming out to this place because the service is so great. The cashiers are genuinely friendly  and know a lot about their menu.   Let me start off by saying that I love their beans, I love their rice and I guess I just love all of their food. They have a wonderful red sauce and a wonderful green sauce. They run out of green sauce a lot though. Carolinas is always very busy so I recommend you know what you want when you get there. I would love to come here more but it's out of the way. It is however worth the drive. Fully recommend"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until recently.  I'm a fan of mexican food from around the valley and when offered to try this place I was up for it.  The first time I ate here it was amazing, and everytime after has been better.  In the last month i've probably eaten here about 6 times.  The 1 thing I would like change about this place is they need more variety when it comes to salsa, I personally would like something hotter, but aside from that this is as good as it gets either for a quick fast food mexican type place or a sit down authentic restaurant."}
{"text":"Omg!!!! The food here is delicious the chimichangas (shredded beef) are my favorite and the flautas .. rice and beans are also good guacamole is always fresh. My daughter used to get the chicken burritos up until they changed the chicken recipe now I have to go when she is really craving a chimi because then she won't eat :( but other than that the food is super delicious it's always packed not just at lunch hour so be prepared to wait a while for your food but it's worth it ."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! Don't be thrown off by the new decor... They make their food just like the original Carolina's. Food is second to none when you compare price to quality. Red chili burro with cheese and double wrapped! Yikes!   If you've never been here then you are in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Wow, How does a place go down after so many years of success is beyond me. I always enjoyed their food bu the lst two times was mediocre at best. Today I ordered a Machaca burrito with egg and potato and received the smallest burrito I have ever seen at any place I have had. Huge tortillas but wrapped around potato and a little Machaca and egg is a waste of a large tortilla. I can be fooled once and give them a break as I know how good they can be but fool me twice in a row says I need to find a better place. Sorry"}
{"text":"In Phoenix, Mexican fast food is as plentiful as a McDonald's is everywhere else.   Filiberto's and Federico's have always been my favorites in Phoenix but Carolina's blows Filiberto's and Federico's almost out of the water...Almost.   Their slogan is something along the lines of \"Best tortillas in town\" and they are correct. Growing up my mom would always take trips to Tucson to get the hand-made flower tortillas and I thought those were the best things since Capri-Sun pouches but even Carolina's even gives those a challenge for my favorite tortilla.   The burritos are what you expect, just as they say on the menu, but they taste fresher than other fast Mexican food and their chorizo is some of the best I have had in the valley (Next to my Mom's).  My only complaint is that the horchata and hibiscus tea (Jamaica) is from a generic company and you can tell in the taste.   The inside is also very nice for a fast-food place and is very clean...That's always a major plus. If you think you love Mexican food, you must try this place."}
{"text":"Darn this place--the food is so damn good, I'm going to have to join Jenny Craig!  This location is in a building that used to be Fazoli's. It's really easy to find. Clean inside too.  The service is FAST & friendly. You wait in line for the next available cashier....usually just one person. If it's busy, there are two cashiers (CASH ONLY).  Of course, some patrons must be so impatient that they decide to stand right NEXT to you at the register as you are paying. (HELLO! How about alittle personal space here, lady!)  The line, which was all the way to the door  (3pm on Saturday) moved very quickly. You wait off to the side with the other customers until they call your number.  The portions are plentiful and prices are cheap!   Next to the soda station, you'll find plastic wrapped forks, spoons, and knives...and their AWESOME hot sauce. You pump the hot sauce into small 1oz containers...mmmm! This stuff is so addicting--you'll want to eat a handful of Altoid mints or you'll have Mexican food breath all day.  Be sure to order some of their flour tortillas! Man, these things are like the size of an automobile tire! HUGE...and delicious!  I think I've just talked myself into going there AGAIN today!"}
{"text":"This taco shop has to be one of my favorites. I can spend a five to six dollars and be too full. This is their third location and I think looks the best interior design wise. I think all of their items are excellent and very reasonably priced. No alcohol, no servers and nothing gourmet but is a great place."}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is delicious , cheap and filling. What else can I say..."}
{"text":"Their homemade burrito shells set them apart. The food is better than average for a fast food place. This place is usually busy anytime. There will be times when the order is wrong, Eg like you pay to add cheese and beans to your carniasada burrito and there is one missing. At that that point- dealing with customer service sucks. You may be argued with. If you have to drive back that really sucks they will in no way act like they care or that your time is valuable. But the food is delicious, you will like it. There's an opportunity for better customer service!"}
{"text":"Great tortillas and food at a good price."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and while the wait was a bit longer than I would have liked, the amount of food for the price is the real value.  I ordered one of the combos and I didn't come anywhere near being able to finish it.  In the future I would skip the tostada as it was bland at best, but the taco and cheese enchilada were wonderful."}
{"text":"The tortillas here are very good and he green chili is decent. My order was to go and when they called my number I noticed there were some items missing. The obvious ones were chips and salsa and two burritos. I informed the employee that I didn't get my chips and salsa and I was missing two burritos. The response I got was \"you didn't get those already?\" I showed the employee my receipt and shortly after received my food. Not having the best confidence in them I checked the containers and saw I didn't receive my fluatas, but instead got beans and chili. I was glad I checked before I left. I have been here a few other times there didn't have any other issues thus I decided in three star rating."}
{"text":"Five stars because I just had the best tacos (of this type) in my entire life at this place!  Yes, this is a fast food environment, yes they serve the food on paper plates, yes you bus your own table etc. etc. Who cares? Does everything have to be Durant's? The fact is, they do Mexican basics better than just about anyone.   I had shredded beef tacos and a single chicken soft taco. Both were the best in their class I have had in my life--including those I've had on trips to Mexico. The hard shell is done in a similar style to what you would find at Filiberto's The soft taco, well, is was a soft taco, but made with Carolina's famous tortillas. Both were a perfect combination of spice, meat, and cheese, with the usual lettuce thrown on as an after thought. The salsa you get out of the little pumps by the soda fountain was also very good.   Housed in an old Fazoli's or Pizza Hut or something, the atmosphere and appearance is similar to one of the newer Filiberto's, but the food sets it apart from the rest.   Oh, and it is cheap.   Love it!"}
{"text":"Carolina's dining area has always been just one step below nasty with delays in cleaning tables and over flowing trash bins.  One tended to overlook hygiene given the former \"home-made\" aspect of their menu.  That has changed over the years, the popularity of the franchise now driving mass-produced Mexican fare that's maybe a notch higher than Taco Bell.  So I was always willing to kick in an extra three bucks or so more than fast food Mexican.  Alas, they have now changed the menu to ala carte and think themselves clever that the customer does not notice their jacked up prices.  I can dine at any number of good sit down Mexican restaurants in my area for about the same price....and without the long waits and having to bus my own table.  Bye Carolina's!  Like that Greek fella that flew too close to the sun with his wax wings, your arrogance and menu pricing manipulations will someday do you in.  Name me another Mexican restaurant that abandoned their combo offerings and I'll name you a business that went under.  Bye!"}
{"text":"Let's deal with the elephant in the room first...this place is totally in an old Fazoli's.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it's the same weirdness as the generic Mexican joint housed in what was clearly a Pizza Hut once upon a time.  Onto the food.  I had heard all sorts of amazing things about the other Carolina's, so maybe I was setting the bar too high, but I wasn't super impressed.  To me it's just average Mexican food, nothing spectacular and maybe even a bit too greasy.  Also, I know this is more of a fast food location and less of a restaurant, but it just seems odd to go to a Mexican food eatery that does not give you chips and salsa at the table.  Like an Italian place with no bread.  (Did Fazoli's serve bread?)  My biggest beef with this place is the food containers.  Styrofoam city!  It's like McDonald's in the '80s over there.  We've always eaten there yet they always box the food up like it's to-go.  Piles and piles of cups and containers fill the garbage cans, which are probably emptied a staggering amount of times per day.  Yuck.  Overall, I'm giving this place an \"eh\" three stars.  Not really worth it for me to drive through the goofy, wiggly part of downtown Peoria to get to."}
{"text":"Decided to come down here for lunch one day.  It literally shares a parking lot to my office.    The place was really retro, it was kinda dirty, and the service was a little slow.  I had to wait like 21 minutes and 12 seconds for my food to be ready, and all I ordered was a pair of chicken soft tacos.  The food was okay at best, I got more lettuce than chicken, and the salsa was not hot at all.  It didn't have no kick or anything to it.  The cashier Samantha was very friendly and polite.   The place uses styrofoam boxes and stuff even when dining in, which I found not very unfriendly for the environment, and I personally think the price is a little high.  Overall a good experience, nothing really good or bad about this place.  I might come back someday, maybe."}
{"text":"This is definetly in an old Fazoli's, I know because I help open it when it was built.  Food here is hit or miss, the green chile chicken burrito is blah. Dry and tasteless.  However, the hard shell chicken taco is very good. The cheese enchiladas are good but not great. I have had the chorizo and potato burrito and it is good,  but Ramiro's and Senor Taco do it better.   This was my second visit, first time i could not rate them because they did not have green salsa. This time they did and I give that 4 stars. But, they guy behind the counter acted like they are doing us all some kind of favor by selling it \"Oh, your lucky today, we have green salsa\". I guess they run out-proof was my first visit- but while it is good, I am not dying to put it on everything, so it is not that good. El Paisano in El Mirage is a carneceria that has the BOMB green salsa.   Why three stars-no carnitas or asada and the tortillas, well the are good but I don't crave them.  I may be a guera ( I am the gringa that speaks spanish and busts all the cabrons talking shit) but let me tell you, I grew up in a Mexican family in Hatch, NM/Las Cruces/El Paso area and have had some spectacular tortillas and these don't even come close."}
{"text":"Got 3 mini beef chimis with rice & beans (no guac or garnish, sour cream on the side). They updated their menu since I last visited and the combo wasn't listed but is still available. It was 30 minutes before closing but the workers were nice enough to make some fresh iced tea for us. My beef chimis were smaller than my friend's chicken chimis, but they were delicious. Love Carolina's mini chimis!"}
{"text":"Love their prices & casual atmosphere. Great value & good food !"}
{"text":"While the food is excellent and we won't stop getting it I can only give 1 star for a pretty petty policy they have.  While ordering 3 quarts of bean, 2 dozen tortillas and 12 tacos it's pretty obvious that I'm not going to eat it there.  When we ask for a container to put some hot sauce in the answer is we can sell you some if you want a larger container.  So off to the salsa station and fill up 10 or 15 of the little salsa cups and try to balance them going out the door.  You would think with an order like that and the amount it cost they would accommodate you with a container of salsa.  I guess when your food is that good and you are packed all the time you don't have to worry about customer service."}
{"text":"This place is a dive. Not to mention bad food. Enchiladas were cold when we finally got our order. The place is dirty beyond what is acceptable. The only upside was that it was cheap. There are so many other good Mexican restaurants... skip this one."}
{"text":"I ordered red chili meat and got red chili sauce with a tiny bit of meat- when I pointed this out to the counter people they just blew it off. Small portions bad service and ok tasting food."}
{"text":"Only ever eaten here twice and the tacos were pretty good but I always pick up a pint of salsa for the family on my way home from work.  GET A PINT OF SALSAAAAAAA!!!! Goes good with chips, Mexican food, even a cold cut sandwich!"}
{"text":"Bad experience!!  Love this place but don't plan on ordering ahead.  Placed an order for tortillas and enchiladas two weeks ago and was given a time to pick items up.  Got there to find enchiladas ready but no tortillas.  Was told 15 to 30 minutes.  45 minutes later they were telling people 30 to 60 minutes.   This was on 12/23 and everyone was picking up orders, but to take orders in advance, then not be able to deliver shows poor planning on management's part. I will no longer depend on them for party food."}
{"text":"The lady on the phone said that they don't sell carne asada tacos anymore."}
{"text":"Oh Carolina's, how are you so good? I'm hooked on the chicken, sometimes mix it up with enchiladas. The tortillas are by far my favorite. You MUST get a buttered tortilla, little slice of heaven. I love that they have horchata as a fountain drink and the hot sauce is just the right amount of spicy. It's always crowded, which is fun. Best Mexican on the west side!"}
{"text":"Love Carolinas!  Been to the one on Cactus a handful of times and have been incredibly impressed with their beef tacos.  Have been to this one a handful of times and have had pretty good meals.  While not as good as the Cactus location (Still haven't been to the OG one downtown), their beef tacos were still good.  I was telling my wife how good they were and decided to come down here and show her what was up!    We placed our order for a combo #9, 4 shredded beef tacos, and a beef flauta for my son.  Total came out to $18.47.  Swiped my card, signed the receipt, got our salsas, waters etc and sat down.  A few minutes later, the food was ready.  My wife thought the beef tacos were just ok (she prefers other places like Lolitas, Fredericos etc).  Mine were as good as the Peoria location can be (still not as good as Cactus) .  My son ate a little bit of the beef flauta.  Meal completed, left, and everything was good.  Everything sounds great so far, right?  Well, it was....until I looked at my bank statement.  My bank statement showed a pending transaction from Carolinas for $23.47.  I thought it might have been an error, and it was pending for a good 4 days.  Know what though?  It cleared my account!  Someone added on $5.00 to my bill!  That is small enough for a lot of people not to notice, but that is also bullshit and will not fly with me.  I called my bank and they immediately refunded the money into my account.  They told me that if the merchant disputed it, I may see a charge back to my account (Which is what should have happened in the first place...I should have been charged $18.47 for the food I ordered!).    Anyways....I will be leery to come back here.  Ill take the drive to the Cactus location instead.  If there is a slim chance I do come back here to the Peoria one, I will most definitely be paying in CASH!  Watch your receipts at this place if you pay with your card!"}
{"text":"Happy sounds around me. Lots of food for the buck. Enough to take home but not going to. I recommend this. Plain floors but great prices. Finished half. Pleased"}
{"text":"Seriously, what more do you need to say about Carolina's than fresh flour tortillas.  If you get nothing else from Carolina's get a dozen tortillas to take home and feast on for days.  You'll regret it if you don't.  The rest of the food is pretty standard Mexican eatery fare."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Saturday just before noon. It was busy as usual but not too bad. I had a green corn tamale and my hubby had a #3 combo that included a taco, tostada and enchilada with rice and beans.   There is limited seating so while I was in line he went and found us a seat. It took quite a while for our food to come out. My tamale was good although there was more masa than meat. It did have good flavor though. Hubby really liked everything except the red sauce on the enchilada. It almost tasted like someone dumped a bunch of red chili in the pot and didn't finish cooking it. I would definitely not order anything with that sauce on it again. The beans and rice were very good."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place and I was not impressed.   It's dirty, a little disorganized (I understand that a restaurant will end up disorganized due to the chaos, but that does not excuse it from being dirty.)  The carne asada burritos were o.k. They don't have guacamole.  Their three way burrito is disgusting. It's meant to have green and red chili with beans, but I bit into the red chili side and didn't get to see if it had any green chili, because I stopped eating it.  Price is decent. Paid 16 dollars for 3 burritos, but for the type of food I got, I wouldn't pay 5 dollars for it. The quality is not great.   I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my sisters. One of my sisters ordered a tamale, she was not satisfied. It was so small to be a bit pricey. If we would have known how small it would be for it's price we could have just gotten tamales off someone who sells on their own. My other sister was not satisfied that she was unable to get salsa well because she really couldn't tell what type. Wouldn't go here again sorry, a little too pricey for the quality."}
{"text":"Nasty doesn't begin to describe the food.  For a few bucks more, you can go to a real sit down Mexican restaurant.  I would rather go to any 'bertos than Carolina's again.  I literally got sick minutes after leaving.  Place was crowded, and noisy.  Tables were unbussed. Restroom looked like a truck stop."}
{"text":"They recently changed their menu and started a rewards program. Same great food. I generally call my order in to minimize the wait time."}
{"text":"It took a while, but I am finally hooked on this place.  You have to realize, it's not real Mexican food, it's America's greasy version.  I finally figured out what to get to stuff me- the taco, enchilada and tostada combo- with all beans and no rice.  They have excellent refried beans and their greasy tacos really do get you hooked eventually.  I don't think I've ever changed a review from 2 to 5 stars, but I am doing it now!"}
{"text":"SO good! Great prices, great portions - my only complaint is that I wish they had better salsa. The chocolate chimis are amazing."}
{"text":"Tried this based on a review by Seftel in the Republic. Really good down-home Mexican food! Hubs had a red Chile burrito, I had green Chile Machaca. Flavor was excellent, meat very lean, tortilla perfect. Green corn tamales also very tasty."}
{"text":"I really wish that they had chosen another location for Carolina's as my office shares the same parking lot and it is way too easy for me to walk across the parking lot and grab some of the best grub around.  Very hard to keep in marathon shape when eating there 4 times a week-I am weak with the discipline.  Their tortillas are the best in town hands down.  I had never tried a buttered or cheese tortilla until a co-worker ordered a few...very addicting.  They only have one salsa which is not fiery but has a kick, and their chicken burritos are just that, chicken and a tortilla.  No Chipotle style faire here. There is ample parking but seating can be a problem for those who don't work next door.  Hit 'em up if in the area!"}
{"text":"Awesome food just as the one on cave creek,  can't beat the prices...  excited to find this location closer by.."}
{"text":"The best, most authentic Mexican food!  I have eaten at most of the Mexican places in the valley during my life and while there are equals and many wanna be's, Carolina's is one of the greats!! I started at their original location many years ago, went to the east side location when I moved that way, and now I try to get to the west side location 2-3 times a month. As has been said before, the tortillas are fantastic!! The tacos are large, fresh and full of flavor. I get the beef or machaca (you have to ask) tacos and a red chili burrito when I visit. The red chili has the tart, earthy, smokey flavor that authentic chili sauce should have. The re-fried beans are fresh and made with lard the way they should be. Don't let the word lard scare you!! Real re-fried beans are made with it and that is what gives them the creaminess and flavor that all fried beans should have!  The staff has always been friendly, and while I cannot speak for others, there are tons of people working behind the counters and I have never had anything but quick, friendly service. The ordering line ALWAYS stretches to the door (or out the door) and the 'to go' area is ALWAYS packed. That says something about the place's quality."}
{"text":"Such excellent service!  This location is currently training employees and I can honestly say we've received better service from those in training than we have the regular staff. Last night I went in to pick up a to-go order. The guy who helped me took the time to go through my order with me to confirm I had everything I ordered and that it was correct. Such a simple thing to do...but imagine if everyplace did this. It would save so much frustration!  Thank you Carolina's for training your employees right!"}
{"text":"If you are starving Carolina's may save your life. Thats about all. I ordered a Taco (shreaded beef) Cheeze enchilada, and a Tamale with rice and beans. The Taco was flavorless in spite of being very greasy, the enchalada was saved from tasteless by a very mild sauce, which also covered the Tamale. Same problem, very little flavor. The rice was gummy and you guessed it  Tasteless. The \"hot sauce\" was so watered down it tasted bland also. Have then been sued by some 80 year old from Ohio? The Only redeeming item was the refried beans, they actually tasted like Pinto beans with just enough flavoring to be good. Oh, the counter crew didn't give me the Taco I ordered, until I pointed out that it was missing from my Styrofoam box. Not a good day at Carolina's, probably one of many. I just can't recomend this place. Maybe if they just make tortillas they would be Ok."}
{"text":"This place sucks I ordered a chorizo, potato and egg burrito and  it was one o'clock and they would not serve it because they  don't serve eggs after 11, I talked to the manager and said it is just a damned egg scrambled with chorizo, he said sorry we just don't serve eggs, will not be back. VIVA TRUMP And I am Mejicano!"}
{"text":"After 4-5 visits since opening May 5th, I'm having trouble wanting to come back.  There are excessive delays in getting your food and a cluster of people standing at the side of the restaurant waiting for their orders too.  It's as if the location size (especially kitchen) can't handle the restaurant volume.  I've figured out that this place is more expensive than I thought because you simply can't fill up on just one item.  It's nice that the burrito is only $3.25 or so, but it's not enough for a hungry adult - add your tostada, chips/salsa, taco, soda pop, etc. and you're easily approaching $10."}
{"text":"I knew this place must be good when I went there for lunch on a Wednesday and the line was out the door at 11:20, so get there early!  I had the beef hard shell tacos and chips and salsa.  Everything was excellent and reasonably priced!  I would highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Always like coming here. I really like their green burritos. Lots of nice chunks of pork. Their tortillas are some of the best I have had. They could do some up grade to the inside of the store. Not dirty just getting very worn. One drink machine not operating and no ice. This was at dinner time and the store had many customers waiting in line to order. Maybe why they ran out of ice. Every time I come here they are very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I don't get the obsession with this place. The tortillas are fresh but other than that everything is literally dripping in grease but not much flavor. Service is also slow considering it is set up as fast food. Plus any place that closes on Sunday gets an automatic loss of a star from me."}
{"text":"I heard this was good authentic Mexican food so I thought I would try it.  The menu selection was very limited (good from a business perspective).  I ordered a burrito and rice; the chicken burrito did not have much flavor and the rice was bland.    I will not go back unfortunately."}
