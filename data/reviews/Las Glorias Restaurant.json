{"text":"Went here after playing golf with some friends.  A friend used to go there with his dad.  I was pleasantly surprised and will be back again.   The beer mugs were super ice cold!!!   I would describe it as a traditional Mariscos place that I would frequent on special occasions growing up in Mexico.   By no means is it fancy but it is clean and service is good.   I had the ceviche and mixed tostadas were very good!  With an ice cold beer... does not get any better.   Will be the new place after golf."}
{"text":"Let me first say I'm totally unbiased because I've tried many of the marisco places in the Valley more then once. This place takes the CAKE or shall I say MARISCO HEAVEN! All you need to know is 4 words.... Camarones Diablas and Camarones Rellenos.....done deal signed sealed and delivered!!!! Must try!!!! We cannot contain ourselves as soon as we walk in the door salivating over the food and their delish micheladas!!!"}
{"text":"El Super Coctel is just like the sopas de mariscos my wife and I get in Rocky Point.  $15 was enough for both of us, six tostadas worth.  So happy to have found a local place for mariscos."}
{"text":"We went for a casual lunch on our anniversary because of the great Yelp! reviews. We have mixed reviews, ourselves, though. The lunch crowd was small...not a good sign, but it is near South Mountain, which isn't a hub of excitement during the week day lunch rush. Inside, the place is old and worn, but clean. The tables aren't very inviting. There are fish tanks with large fish in them. The place is warmer than we like, so the overall effect was a bit dark and muggy.  The people who work there are wonderful--extremely helpful and nice. Honestly, that is the only reason we decided to stay--didn't want to turn around and walk out just because it looked kinda grungy inside (that is, because the food reviews were all so good.).  The bottom line is this: Everything on the menu is seafood,and it is Mexican. We did NOT love our food, but we did not get sick later, either.  There are no other meats. If we were at the ocean I think it would probably be fantastic, but inland, uh....no. The fish tacos tasted extremely FISHY and not in a good way. The crab meat enchiladas were authentic, dang it, but unfortunately the verde sauce was too tangy and there was pimento in the mix. It left a \"stale\" flavor in our mouths.  We would love to know the day of the week the fresh fish comes in. If we knew, we'd go back on THAT day. Otherwise, skip it."}
{"text":"Okay shrimp cocktail. The ceviche was better.  In fact if I return, it will be for the ceviche. I've had better elsewhere, but in a pinch, it'll do.  Curious to taste the shrimp Culichi.  The waitresses were pleasant.  I did not like the fact that there are no free refills on the soft drinks.  I will say that I did feel like I was transported to Mexico, which was kind of cool. Loud music, but that's how they do it!"}
{"text":"A+ all the way around, shrimp cocktail, ceviche, CRAB ENCHILADAS! omg sum of the best iv ever had, Plus the jute box is new and updated, play some great music and enjoy some delicious sea food in a lovely enviroment..."}
{"text":"Love your civichiii tostadas there awsome !!good services sorry I can't post the pic..."}
{"text":"The family and I came here because I had a craving from fish tacos. My little guy got the chicken nuggets. And my husband and I shared a fried shrimp plate and a fried fish plate,then used those to make tacos for ourselves. So, first the kids chicken nuggets... Honestly kinda gross. The meat inside was much (like they deep fried canned chicken, for chicken salad) now almost every restaurant gives the kids menu short shrift and Las Glorias is no exception. This isn't a complaint just an observation. Now the main dish(es): the shrimp, the batter was ok, nothing flavorful or extraordinary. Not greasy which often happens when coming to a joint like this. The fish was equally adequate (and underwhelming) , except that was greasy. My husband picked off most of the batter and then ate it. Nothing about the meal was great. What was really good however was the salsa they brought to the table with the chips. That was particularly good and gave the tacos the only flavor (other than the limes) there was to be had.   As a non-food aside: the music was loud and incessant. Just like every other 'authentic' Mexican food joint.   Would I go here again? Probably not. This is too big a city with too many wonderful restaurants to waste time just getting adequate food."}
{"text":"If your looking for something different and new try this place! I eat here once a month at least. The shrimp ceviche is bomb! Not to pricy for the food and a good spot to have some drinks too! It's not a Scottsdale spot so don't expect the world! Try it u won't be upset"}
{"text":"I was a Regular customer up to today. I didn't mind the service because sometimes you get the good waitresses and sometimes you get the ones with the attitude. But today I went in for a small order and as I was eating I grabbed some crackers and it looked like the wrapper had been bitten by mice. I brought it to the waitress attention and the owner soon came and snapped at me that her restaurant was very clean and that it must have been the kids that come in. There's no way it was kids because the crackers looked like they weren't tampered with the edges of the wrapper were bitten by mice I mean how stupid can you be to not notice that it was mice getting to the crackers. Very upset at how the owner handled the situation and still starting talking crap at how little I was buying. Smh never coming in again."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch at Las Glorias for the first time yesterday. Visiting this wonderful restaurant is like visiting Rocky Point Mexico, only the food is even better here!  I ordered the Camaron Relleno's (bacon wrapped shrimp) with cheese, and I have never had better. The meal came with refried beans and salad, and the shrimp were served on a bed of french fries.  My wife ordered the fresh shrimp cocktail with calamari, and it was fantastica!  The restaurant was very clean, the service was great, and the friendly owner (Ruth) even visited our table to be sure that we were happy with our meal.  The beautiful murals on the walls give the restaurant a nice Baja kinda feeling.  We can't wait to get back to Las Glorias and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Family owned Mexican seafood restaurant. Good a/c. Clean. Friendly waitstaff. Husband and I shared Shrimp wrapped in bacon, stuffed with cheese. It came with rice, beans, tortillas, and salad. Very good, but beans were plain. I had a cerveche tostada, which was very good."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my daughter... our food was cold and so gross... it was disgusting. Worse than drunk cafeteria food. The service was slow and I had to flag down the waitress for service..."}
{"text":"First time there and last time there. The waitress came over and it was awkward.. felt like I walked in as they were closing (noon, 2 hrs after opening). The place was dead silent except for the cooks music in the far back. The food came out and the main dish was not tastie.. took 3 bites and I was done. On my way out I thought that Filaberto would have tasted better and costed less."}
{"text":"Horrible seafood. Horrible martinis. They have a Martini slushi machine. Returned half or food because it smelled so bad. This place is a running joke for us now."}
{"text":"Cocktails=YUM! Must eat there just for that. A bit pricey. But clean. Good customer service. Very nicely decorated with full wall murals."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant atmosphere.  It almost looked Greek.  Hard time communicating with the waitress since I don't speak Spanish.  Didn't get what I thought I was ordering. Ended up with chile rellenos that were just okay.  The cheese was quite solid in the middle.  Also got rice and beans that I didn't really touch.  Never got refills on the drinks.  Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Had the super cocktail (I think that's what it's called)it was good, nothing special though. Service wasn't the best, lady wasn't the friendliest and took a while to check on us in between times."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. The shrimp in my cocktail was stiff and rubbery, and the margarita I ordered was more ice and salt than alcohol.I would have settled for fast food instead. The atmosphere is nice and inviting, and the staff are courteous, but take a while to get to you after initially ordering."}
{"text":"To be fair, I'm not that much into seafood so I know going in there was questionable. I do eat shrimp occasionally and enjoy them, however, I ordered a shrimp cocktail. I noticed they had different types of cocktails and I asked the waitress for clarification and she didn't help much. So I got my cocktail and it had shrimp, octopus and some white squares which I am not sure what kind of meat it was. The shrimp was okay but not the best. My niece got chicken nuggets and they were horrible. My brother in law tried my cocktail and couldn't swallow it. Definitely don't recommend this place. No one else liked their food."}
{"text":"Best ceviche I've ever had. The decor is cute and made me feel like I was on a vacation in a coastal Mexican town. Service was friendly and the owner stopped by our table to say hello. How nice! I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Service is slow and spotty with 3 tables in the place it took forever to get a refill on water or chips and salsa. Otherwise the food was a step above the average Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great place to have fresh mariscos in South Phoenix."}
{"text":"Came for dinner because my mom wanted fish tacos. We went in and were told sit anywhere you like. We sat by the goldfish tank in the first room. Ordered the chips and salsa to start, the waitress had  just one other customer, an annoying Mexican man sitting by himself for dinner while loudly talking on his cell phone through out his entire meal.  The good; shrimp cocktail and warm chips, the small cocktail had 7-8 medium shrimp tasted fresh. The bad; grilled fish fillet and salsa, the fish was overly salted, salsa was mediocre.  Service was fast and friendly though we were completely ignored after the food was delivered. We waited and waited for the waitress to come back, finally had different lady tell us, I'll get your check, waited ten more minutes, nothing. Finally my mom just went up to the register to pay. I will not be returning.  Warning, the dumpster in the parking lot smells like rotten seafood tentacles reaching out to greet you, really appetizing for people walking in to eat at this joint."}
{"text":"Friendly service and price is moderate for seafood.  We had the shrimp cocktail which was below  average in my opinion.  We don't recommend the shrimp enchiladas because they were a bland but the bacon wrapped shrimp were really good and worth the price.  I had the fried mojarra  (fried whole fish). It was perfectly crispy and cooked.my only complain about the fish is that it had too much salt. The saltiness made it a little hard to finish.  With how perfectly crispy it was the fish would be fIne with only a sprinkle of salt seasoning.  Also no free refills on soft drinks is a bummer.   The biggest problem with this place is the smell of nasty urinals when you walk in.  It's really disgusting even though the place looks clean I couldn't get over the smell so we will not be back."}
{"text":"Went to Las Glorias after seeing it on \"Check Please Arizona\".  The restaurant is all about fish.  It's not really \"Mexican food\".  Let me say our shrimp cocktail was very good.  We both had the tacos (I've had better).  I noticed at another table they were just having shrimp cocktails and drinks.  Now I know why.  If I every return it will be only for the shrimp cocktails and salsa and chips.  $50+ total for dinner (one shrimp cocktail, 2 taco dinners and 3 margaritas).  The beans and rice on my plate were cold (most places the beans are so hot you have to let them cool a bit before you take a bite).  Sorry Las Glorias, I'm new to downtown Phoenix and next time I'll try another Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Went on a random South Phoenix adventure wanting to try something new, and Las Glorias ended up being the destination -- very happy that it was! I ordered the camarones diablo, which was everything I could hope for when ordering Mexican style seafood. It was plump grilled shrimp with a Chile sauce that had just the right amount of spice. Add French fries and grilled onions to the mix and you get one mouth watering meal. My boyfriend was also very happy with his dish which was the filet relleno. The atmosphere was fun with the painted sea walls....We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing, and since only two other tables were filled the entire Thurs. dinner time we were there, I should have suspected something, but we decided to persevere. I had called the Health Dept. and there were no recent complaints (one of the posts here had me REALLY worried--it was by a former employee who told a horror story about roaches and that did little to get me salivating), and I read the tips about looking at menu before coming if you are unfamiliar with Spanish, but that didn't help much since online menu offers inadequate descriptions and no pictures. I tried researching various words, but that gets tiresome and is often confusing. For ex., the first definitions for culichi on Goggle involve women from a region in MX with big bottoms and smaller tops. Honestly, for a restaurant that's been around for 25 years, you'd think they'd care enough to inform potential customers that visit their website. The menu on-site wasn't much better--some pictures, but no captions--is it supposed to be a game of match the picture to the description? Why should I have to work so hard? The server was absolutely no help either as there was a language barrier. I was trying so hard, asking \"frito, frito, frito?\" while pointing to various menu items since I wanted something fried and crispy like one of the pictures but when it came it looked baked or maybe pan-fried and the shrimp were dry and tough, but the fish was juicy and tasty with peppers and onions, but not what I wanted--I ordered by the number and nowhere in the description was there any mention of fajitas yet that is what it seemed like I was served. A meal with some generic tortillas, over-salted refried beans and a timbale sized amt of flavorless rice, flavorless shredded cabbage, (thank goodness for the limes!) and god only knows why, some tossed in stringy mass produced limp fries scattered around the plate. But how could I complain when there was no one there who could adequately speak English? If they don't want to accommodate non-Spanish speakers, let us know or help us out. The table's salsa was flavorful, but the tortilla chips were nothing special. My friend's bacon wrapped shrimp was dried out and if the shrimp were supposed to be stuffed with cheese, it must've melted away. The other couple ordered a whole fried fish and that was to their liking, but they felt the same about the sides. There is little ambiance in the hotel convention room decor clearance sale tables and chairs, but the primarily azure blue sea themed murals are kitschy cute but it would be nice if the little fountain to the side would have been working--at least the live Oscar fish in the aquarium seemed to be faring well. If you're passing by and see the giant octopus and shrimp painted outside the restaurant, you may be tempted to enter. If you get closer yet and see the other enchanting murals on the porch, esp, the alluring mermaid, you may hear the siren's call to eat here, but resist. Fill your ears with wax or leave your seatbelt on like Odysseus tying himself to the mast and move on...."}
{"text":"Yelpers! You're letting me down here. Why has no one else reviewed Las Glorias yet? There are so many good reasons to go but I'll list a few:  *It's only 10 minutes south of downtown. Yes, it's South Phoenix, but you'll go further for Los Dos Molinos and it's not even that great.  *The people are incredibly nice. They don't speak any English so you'll have to order in Spanish, but they're always polite and smiling when I go in to eat or pick up.  *The food is damn good. Fresh seafood options include incredible ceviche tostadas, mouthwatering Camarones Culichi, grilled fish in garlic sauce and more.  *This place needs the support of more Yelpers to survive. It's weathered the last two years, but I'm always afraid they'll close their doors. And that would be a loss.   Come on, give it a shot! If you don't want to eat in, you can order to go. We've done it many times and the food is always great to have in front of the TV with beer."}
{"text":"Not recommended. Food was gross. We asked about certain food items and our waitress did not know what to tell us. I ordered a shrimp tostada which was just horrible. My daughter, who doesn't like sea food, ordered chicken nuggets and told me to try them because she didn't like them. They were the worst chicken nuggets I have ever tasted. My sister ordered a shrimp cocktail and it too was just not good."}
{"text":"2 words: Camarones Bucaneros. Hands-down one of the best dishes I've ever had. Try it and thank me later."}
{"text":"I use to work here, the kitchen is swarmed with roaches! A lady once found one in her soup so she sent it back, they refunded her, all normal; until, they simply picked the roach out added some water, a couple shrimp and reserved it to another customer. Plus the mold on the walls and the fact that they rinse their dishes and don't actually wash them, I would never eat there."}
