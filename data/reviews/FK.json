{"text":"Exceptional food, decor, service. Attention to detail was obvious all around , from the food presentation to the little extras (amuse bouche). This is not an every day kind of restaurant unless you are accustomed to spending in excess of $100 pp for a meal- but it is a lovely worthwhile memorable experience for a special occasion. Highly recommend. Book well in advance as they have an extensive following from their previous location on College."}
{"text":"One of the many things that sets FK above most other restaurants, is the extraordinary attention to detail; in the decor, the service and of course, the food itself. Quality is everywhere. If you want an exceptional meal at a decent price, then this is the place to come.

The food: 
three types of warm home-made bread appear shortly after sitting down, accompanied by a pungent taste buds stimulating roasted red pepper/garlicky hummus. 
This is followed by a small serving of heirloom beet soup surrounding a dollop of goat cheese mayonnaise. (Both of these are gratis - just an automatic part of the whole meal).
We ordered a salad which was artichokes with radicchio leaves and chives and a green goddess dressing - yes, it exists. Crisp, slightly bitter, and tasty - sufficient to share.
The lobster ravioli was a small portion and exquisitely executed. The pasta was al dente and lobster pieces clearly identifiable - not mush. Good peppery tomato sauce accompaniment. 
The gnocchi with pancetta and lemon Gorgonzola cheese sauce had multiple textures, arrived piping hot, slightly spicy from black pepper. A good size to share.
We highly recommend the duck breast coated in Cocoa nibs with foie and Jerusalem artichokes. Simply beautifully cooked, extraordinarily tasty, and again, plenty to share.
If you are dessert person, then the blood orange custard in a crisp pastry shell with mint and vanilla ice cream must surely tempt you? It is small but lovely. Or, maybe the pear tart(in) with warm deep caramel and a pastry base ,again with vanilla ice cream.

The wine list:
There is a good wine list with representation from a wide part of the world. Most of it reasonably priced. A slight leaning towards Italian and Third World wines.

The decor:
This is a small establishment in two rooms with about a total seating for 50 people.
There is a bar with half a dozen or so places to sit. There are big mirrors which give a bigger space effect. Soft suspended lights. Lots of bench seating around the walls. Beautiful Laura Ashley like curtains. An airy room with wooden floors and somehow the noise doesn't become cacophonous.

The service:
There are lots of well informed waiters who are extraordinarily attentive.

We spent much longer there than I had anticipated and enjoyed every moment."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far the best restaurant in town. Frank creates fresh, ingenious masterpieces. The hits just keep on coming even when you think he can't outdo himself anymore! There is nothing he hasn't thought about from his homemade bread to charcuturie hand picked fresh that day. Escargot, Oysters rock, beef tartar, veal, steak, fish, lobster, amuse bouche between servings, Risotto with duck leg, and then the pastries to die for!!! Delicate and flavourful. Frank is impeccable about every detail. Shawn is the perfect partner who is the nuts and bolts of this operation from the front bar, decor, patio, customer attention, she was does it all! VIP service all the way. Prices are very reasonable. Eddy and Warren are the most loyal hardworking customer service staff! You have to try Franks! If 10 is perfect then Frank's is 20!!!

{"text":"Fantastic new restaurant on St Clair.

I went for my birthday dinner here, and the food was stupendous! Our server brought a lovely amuse-bouche, a goat-cheese croquette with sorrel, over which was poured a heavenly sunchoke cream. Fantastic taste and presentation.

Had the warm asparagus salad to start with a dry Riesling, terrific pairing (and I'm glad the server suggested it, as I typically shy away from Riesling). Followed up with veal tenderloin with crispy sweetbreads and stuffed artichoke - so many beautiful flavours and textures! - and a glass of sparkling red, which I was excited to see, since it is a relatively rare find.

My son ordered the fettucine puttanesca with seared tuna, and cleared his plate despite being a picky eater. 

For dessert, the goat cheesecake with rhubarb in port, so lovely, and a dark chocolate truffle. 

Everything I could have hoped for on my birthday. A beautiful setting for a beautiful meal."}
{"text":"I heard all great things about FK, so I was really excited ...then...EHH..A bit overrated...according to the website, they changed their menu often due to market availability, that night I ordered pasta with Puttanesca sauce and tuna on top, the pasta was cooked perfectly however , what's missing ? the taste.
The sauce was bland, the tuna was overcooked ( 3 little squares )
and the portion is way too small.
Appetizers were good, my friend ordered the steak, she liked it.

Maybe just a bad night ? not too sure, after hearing great things and having been living in Italy for 10 years, I was expecting a better pasta dish than this

FK ? A - OK :)"}
{"text":"I loved the Frank's Kitchen on College Street so I wanted to try this new location. The room is pretty and relaxing. This is not a hipster restaurant .... on a Sunday night as a 40ish a couple we were the youngest people there. But the food was delicious ... soFt- shelled crab, lobster risotto and a dessert combining my favourite two flavours chocolate and banana. Service was attentive. I will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"Sometimes, fancy places get all caught up in the \"presentation\" - creating a great dining vibe/atmosphere, overly exaggerating the attentiveness of the service, meticulously plating the food like it's some art/design sculpture - that they forget the most important thing: the food.

I'm happy to report that FK escaped this trap. For while the ambiance of the place was great, the service impeccable and the plating beautiful, the food was definitely the star. Whether it was the oh-so-good table bread, the interesting-play-on-different-flavours appetizers, the heartier-than-usual-for-a-place-like-this main dishes, or the perfect-recap-to-a-good-meal desserts, FK's food offerings definitely delivered in terms of their quality, taste, and unique take.

Would I say FK is hype proof and the best restaurant in the city? No. But ignore the trappings and the ooh-ing and ahh-ing, and come to FK to simply enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that is worthy of Michelin Star category. 

If you ever watch the movie Babette's Feast and Chocolat, you will know your soul has been treated to an awakening. When food is prepared  from that calibre of purpose and passion,  you feel it in your bone. 

Frank and Shawn, this husband and wife team have perfected what eating out in a quality restaurant feels like.  From the minute you walk in being greeted with such genuine hospitality to the last bite of homemade chocolate...you know it is was an experience that will be hard to forget. 

My dinner last night with Pu NEH,  a foodie that just arrived from LAX was epic with each distinctive dishes precisely executed, using superlative ingredients.

Congratulations Frank,  Shawn and each of your carefully chosen staff on this new venture!
