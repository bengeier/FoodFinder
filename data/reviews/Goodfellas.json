{"text":"Food was just ok. The service was awful. Our waitress didn't look at me when she spoke to me but addressed my husband instead. I didn't feel welcomed and she insisted that we order our drinks even though our drinks were still full because she said she might be too busy to get us drinks if wanted another later. I felt rushed and the pizza was burnt.   I'm a foodie and I've eaten at many restaurants and I have to say that for the service and what they are asking you to pay I'd recommend just about anywhere else."}
{"text":"One word...EXCEPTIONAL! Food was fresh and delicious! Service was warm, friendly and just overall on point. Food came right on time. Ambiance brings you back to Italy. Love, love, love and will definitely return! I live in Mississauga and can't wait to go to their Streetsville location!"}
{"text":"After several attempts to like Good Fellas - I have now officially given up. The prices are outrageous for the quality not to mention the (lack of) service.   I ordered a take out pizza tonight. Quoted 15-20 minutes, I arrived in 15 and was handed a cold pizza that I have now had to heat up in my own oven. I asked for a light sprinkling of parmesan cheese on top, and was charged an additional $5.00!!! I understand you cannot give away free food/toppings, but this is a common request to finish the Margherita pizza, which itself was $15.00. It did not warrant that extreme of a cost. It's a tacky way to put off a customer that otherwise loves to dine out and is willing to pay for quality and service.   I will not spend any more of my money here. What a disappointment for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Oh man the cheese! Split the charcutarie board and could not be happier! The motzerela ball was so unbelievably good I would think I never tried cheese before. Will absolutely return for special ocations $$$."}
{"text":"Dinner for 6 people Saturday night on the Patio.This place is absolutely amazing, Not sure why the two negative reviews. Definitely the best restaurant in Bloor West village. The Pizza is to die for and the pastas were tasty and well plated. I have lived in the Village for 7 years and this is just what we needed. The server Andrea was knowledgeable and friendly. Salvatore witch is the Manager came to our table to make sure all was good , he was polite and funny. I was introduced to the owners John and Rick and Was amazed to see that the owners were actually there working.The decor is absolutely authentic and rustic, a teleportation to Italy. Great Job guys!!!"}
{"text":"This place was great! The food was delicious, the service outstanding and the decor beautiful. A little pricey but nothing outrageous. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner at the new Goodfellas location on Bloor West....overall a disappointment.   The quality of the food and the experience simply doesn't justify the prices.  I'm sad to say it because I was really looking forward to a good restaurant in my neighborhood.  First of all the decor is like a Disney version of what an Italian restaurant looks like.  Second of all, it's all hard surfaces inside so it's so loud that we had to yell all night to be heard on the other side of the table.  More importantly, it's about the food.  The amateur tomato sauce is way too acidy and salty.  These are definitely not San Marzano tomatoes from Italy.  I'm betting they are San Marzano seeds grown in the US.  The gnocchi has no delicacy to it.  I'm betting these are bought frozen from a grocery store. Tough like plasticene.  The veal was a disaster....imagine shoe leather cooked endlessly until it's tender, but it's still flavorless shoe leather.  The pizza was the only item that was okay, but again the sauce was questionable, over salted and no rich tomato basil flavour.  Nothing like Pizzeria Libretto or Terroni.  What it all comes down to is there simply is no subtlety or sophistication in any of the food or the ambience.  Like Disney World.  Yet their prices are significantly higher than Libretto or Terroni.  Goodfellas has good branding and talk all the right talk, but they don't walk the walk.  This may be high quality food in the suburbs but it's low-end mediocre in Toronto.  The only exception was the excellent, friendly service from Tibor.  However that was almost ruined by some bald guy who I think was the host.  Quite frankly he came across like a tacky Gino from Woodbridge who again talked big, but when we told him about a problem which he said he'd take care of, he just disappeared and continued going around chatting with tables like a 1950's lounge singer in a bad suit. It's a new restaurant, so there's still a chance to change. If I was the owner, I'd spend the next month eating at Giancarlos on College, Libretto on Ossington, Enoteca Sociale on Dundas, Buca on King or Campagnolo on Dundas.  These are all restaurants in the same price range, yet the cooking is an entirely different universe than the mediocre and beginner level Italian food being served here.  Remember, Italian cooking is about choosing incredible quality ingredients, cooking them exactly right so the texture is perfect, and letting the natural flavours come through.  I'm guessing this owner does most of his ingredient shopping at NoFrills.  Put some sound absorbing panels in the ceiling.  Make them in interesting shapes and colours and it can also add some ambience.  Maybe hire a professional interior designer to add some subtle touches to get rid of the Disney World feel.  Lower your prices at least to Pizzeria Libretto's.  Their Caprese is $11 and exquisite.  Yours is $20 and all about size, no quality."}
{"text":"We went on opening night and service was poor and slow. Margarita pizza was really bad - no taste. Pasta was ok. We didn't go back for half a year and tried again tonight. How do you go wrong with salad? The dressing was all vinegar and salt. I couldn't stop cringing. The gnocchi was watery tomatoe juice out of a can. Actually I've had better canned sauces. The mushroom tagliatelle tasted like Campbell's mushroom soup but watered down. The tiramisu was nothing special and small. The beer and latte were the only decent part. The meal cost $80!! Never going back. I'm a pregnant hungry woman and I still couldn't finish my salad or pasta no matter how hungry I was. It was the worst Italian food. The server shared feedback with manager who didn't care."}
{"text":"Tried this place out after seeing this in the neighbourhood for awhile.  The decor is great and very welcoming.  We had a great booth seat which was perfect for my toddler.  We ordered calamari for an appy and that was good. Whole calamari pieces perfectly breaded.  For mains, We had the seafood pasta, lamb, and procuetto pizza which were all mediocre.  My pasta dish was substantially smaller then the same dish my friend ordered.  The egg pasta had a unique texture which I didn't like too Much as I found it floury and on the mushy side.  The tiramisu and coffee for dessert was good.  Overall average rating as I've had better."}
{"text":"I had a very disappointing meal at Goodfellas, old mill location. I ordered the linguine pescatore and asked that it not be served spicy as I noticed it had a hot pepper symbol on the menu. The linguine was then delivered to me completely bland, without any flavour whatsoever. It was like eating cardboard for $26.00. I left half the meal in the dish and the waiter took away the dish without asking if there was a problem with the food. My companions both ordered pizza and enjoyed their meals but I won't be returning to this restaurant anytime soon ."}
{"text":"I have to say that my feedback regarding service is consistent with other reviews. We had dinner there tonight as it's in my hood and it was recommended by other friends. We all really enjoyed our meals but the service was really lacking. Our waiter had no personality whatsoever and when I asked for his suggestion for a sharing appetizer, he pointed to the list of appetizers on the menu. Not helpful!  He was abrupt and barely cracked a smile. I'm not sure how he can be in the service industry."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had been here before and had a positive experience, however when I was reading Yelp reviews I wasn't feeling overly excited about going.  However, I have to say I was impressed.   We were greeted and sat promptly.  Our waiter was very calm, happy, patient and attentive.  He started out by taking our drink order and brought them immediately.  After giving a respectable amount of time he came back for our food order and was able to explain and give good advice about what we were ordering (ie. one pizza for two adults and two kids may not be enough but could start and see how we do).  We ended up ordering the seafood platter to start with which was very fresh and tasty.  Maybe it could have had a few more wedges of lemon on it but once we asked for more lemon it was brought right away.  The seafood platter also had salad on it.  The only comment my son made was that it only had one piece of shrimp and more Smelt, however the quality and taste of the food was satisfactory.   We then ordered two pizzas (rapini one and prosciutto pizza).  Timing on the pizzas was perfect.  They arrived fresh and hot to table.   I personally might ask next time for the pizza to maybe be done a little longer (ie. well done) but still have no complaints about it.   The dough tasted very fresh along with all of the ingredients.  The rapini had a nice crisp on it and was well seasoned and sausage wasn't fatty, great combo with the fior di latte.   I was very impressed with the interior design and decor of the restaurant.  It was cozy, dim lit, comfortable and very clean.  The washrooms were also very clean.    I am looking forward to our next visit and trying the pasta."}
{"text":"A very mediocre experience. I tried the pizza quatro staggioni and it was a bit cold, lacked flavour, was empty - tomato sauce was not flavourful enough and was a bit watery. There was not enough substance on top of it - the artichoke and champignon quarters of my pizza had probably 4 slices of a mini champignon and 5 mini artichoke leaves. In short, my pizza felt like a cold piece of tomato with mozzarella and some mini veggies here and there.  My spouse's calzone was nothing out of this world either. The only thing I really liked was the Italian amber beer, but not enough to go back."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place.  But it's not quite there!  The restaurant is beautiful.  The service was lacking.    The food was just okay.  The caprese salad felt like a \"make your own\" because it was so rudimentary.  The Quattro stagioni pizza was swimming in oil.  $128 for lunch.  Has so much potential.  The staff have to be more attentive and not leave it to the owner.  Or the owner should leave the staff to the tables as the customer is left feeling unattended.  04/01/17 - tried again to see if things improved.  Got to tell you, the owner is controlling and the servers are not attentive because of this.  Beautiful surroundings, but service is lousy and pizza is not great."}
{"text":"Great service. Authentic Italian cuisine. Nice atmosphere. The owner was very welcoming and genuinely nice. Tiramisu was superb."}
{"text":"The prices here are pretty steep.  I have tried four types of pizza from Goodfella's and by far the Porco Piccante has been the best. I would get it again as a treat for myself.   I recommend getting takeout from here as the restaurant gets incredibly noisy at peak times. The decor is gorgeous, however."}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy Goodfellas as I was a regular in streets Ville where originally opened. Unfortunately there's no WOW factor here, As you're walking in and being greeted by a bunch of students that seems to be a organize of confusion. Food is OKKK bones in the fish and calamari was chewy, when I asked for some tomato sauce to put on the calamari they wanted to bill me $3 on a $19 dish - REALLY!!!  They just opened up like any business it takes time to organize the kinks out of any new restaurant or business. I hope they figure it out soon Etobicoke was not a very forgiving place. They got a beef up their portions also for the prices they're charging, And maybe offer some bread and olive oil to the tables would've been a nice touch."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim after a little stroll down blood west. The ambiance was a a little cheesy and stereotypical but what it lacked in presence it packed in quality of food... and that after all is what counts! We had the caprese salad and a couple of pies. The dough was perfect as was the flavor. Very pleasant surprise on a Wednesday evening, recommend!"}
{"text":"The two stars lost is due to the service. The mid aged man server was not good what so ever. We order spaghetti for our 3 years old daughter and he brought uncooked spaghetti and when we just gave him a feedback (not complained), he said the pasta machine does the cooking on time.  We order the sauce on the side as my daughter doesn't like too much sauce so we put it as she needs it. So, in Normal case those spaghetti would have been cooked again with the sauce after the machine pulls it out. In this case, the cook or the server didn't bother and the server had an attitude !"}
{"text":"Great service, good wine and nice decor.  I'd recommend it for an intimate evening out."}
{"text":"I went to Goodfellas yesterday for the first time. I walked by it recently and was very interested in dining there. Goodfellas is amazing!!! It has nice decor. Italian music plays and you can hear it in the clean washrooms. Yes, it is expensive, but I have nothing bad so say about the food or the service so far. I had the Capo Di Capi pizza. It had Italian fiore de latte cheese on it. I had never heard of it before. It tasted amazing and different than any other cheese I had eaten! The crust on the pizza was so amazing!!! It was thick and soft. It was the best pizza crust I have ever eaten!!! My server was friendly. This is a great place to come with friends or to go on a date. I will definitely return to Goodfellas!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Valentines, not knowing they had a set menu for the evening as there wasnt a notice when my boyfriend was booking online. Neither of us were up for a full 3 course, so we asked if we could order a few pieces from the menu without ordering the full 3 courses. The waitress was kind but told us that they were not flexible with being selective with orders. This is an odd way to do business. She went and spoke with the manager to see if they would be flexible but she came back and told us he was not willing to budge. We ended up leaving because that is a terrible way to run a restaurant. Sure, it was how they had planned out the menu and kitchen staff for the night, but did that they would not budge for a customer is terrible service. We weren't asking for unique items they werent serving that night, just the ability to be flexible with the order. We wont be coming back which is unfortunate as I used to like it."}
{"text":"Went to Goodfellas over the weekend, The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, Hanging meats and cheese in a display case the Pizza and prep station on full view.  Now comes to the menu, prices range from $15-35, The pizza menu is a bit of rip off seeing a cheese and tomato personal pizza starts at $15 and the most expense one ending at $30.  As for the selection of Pizzas i found when reading over them that you tended to find one or two ingredients that sounded appealing but the rest left to be desired.  I ordered the steak at $29 quite frankly should have headed over to Ruth Chris instead.  The steak arrives apparently it is a NY Strip looked like a cheap breakfast steak pretty small no thickness whatsoever and is floating on a bed of Peas and Mushrooms.  Wife ordered the Risotto with mushrooms and Sausage, tiny bits of sausage and mostly cheese and rice handful of mushrooms as well. Order of Sangria to share came out in this over sized  beer glass which you are required to have a member of the wait staff come over to your table and ladle out some into your glass. Will not be back.  The service is excellent no issues there the only problem you leave feeling hungry and not satisfied."}
{"text":"Hello,  We have recently enjoyed a delicious lunch and dinner at Goodfellas. We welcome Goodfellas as indeed a great addition to our neighborhood and a much needed place with good eats and drinks. The environment is warm and beautifully rustic, it is also friendly and inviting. Whether for family or a romantic dinner, Goodfellas is great for any occasion.    Their pizzas are made in a stone oven, adding to the aromatic and delicious flavor of old ancient times. The dishes are superbly tasty, wholesome and there's something for everyone. The service was amicable, cordial and very professional. Our server, Tabare, made sure all our needs were taken care of and it made our dining at Goodfellas a wonderful experience. Good service and customer care are rare these days. Hence, we left very pleased to have chosen Goodfellas for our dinner. Goodfellas is a good destination to sit in a relax atmosphere whether in the patio or inside, sipping a cocktail while waiting for a tasty meal to come."}
{"text":"This review is from my 60+ year old mum who doesn't use Yelp but wanted to let people know about her not so great experience at Goodfellas.  Four pizzas, one bottle of wine, and two appetizers later, we ended up splitting the bill and each person paid $55 (there were 6 of us).  Ridiculous. Especially since I have had better food elsewhere.    Something else that pulled my rating down was the fact that on the hottest day of the year (43 degrees was it?) the air conditioning was \"broken\".  Everyone in the restaurant was sweating buckets.  I heard that Rocco no longer owns the Goodfellas and that's a shame, he was an awesome restaurant owner and very friendly with guests.  Atleast that would have cut the tension last night when we were sweating and overpaying."}
{"text":"We live in the building, so this is a super convenient dinner night out for us! I love the variety of pizzas and appetizers on the menu. I adore the outside patio during summer evenings. However, the prices are a bit on the high end."}
{"text":"Very overpriced. Food was awful as well as was my wine... my pasta was not very well cooked (way far from al dente). Desert was not any better. Cannoli tasted as they were just brought from Walmart.. and were still frozen"}
