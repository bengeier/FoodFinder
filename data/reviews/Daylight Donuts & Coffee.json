{"text":"Stopped in for the first time this morning and i'm glad I did! I always like to support local business when I can. Upon walking in the decor is clean and modern, I could definitely hang out with my laptop catching up on work things there. Now onto the donuts! WOW! I ordered half a dozen for my work team and it was so hard to choose! My favorite was definitely the maple smore donut it was fantastic. I ordered a mocha as well, it was good but not hot more like luke warm. I would definitely come back again and try their lunch sandwiches because the menu looked really good. Overall, if you haven't ventured here yet you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place since they opened and it was well worth the wait. The donuts were delish! (I tried lemon cream cheese bear claw and sour cream) and the coffee is also amazing. The staff is so so sweet and helpful- made me feel very welcome there. I will definitely be back- a drive through donut and coffee place in cle Hts will be dangerous to me!"}
{"text":"Delicious doughnuts! I measure a doughnut shop by its treatment of the basic raised glazed joint, and they receive high marks! They're made in house daily. They also have more trendy options, like ones with cereal toppings and whatnot along with the classics. It's a nice clean shop. They also seem to have some kind of discount depending on the time of day you go there. Maybe"}
{"text":"A peanut butter creme filled donut with chocolate frosting to top it and a large coffee for under 5 dollars was awesome! It was the perfect start to a perfect morning and I loved every bit of it."}
{"text":"Great tasting donuts! They are definitely on the smaller side and they are still perfecting the \"look\", but they are SO tasty. Probably the best blueberry donut I've ever had. Also, awesome coffee.   Can't wait to make this a regular stop on my morning commute."}
{"text":"This place caught our eye when it opened so close to where we are - walking distance to fresh donuts? Score! We went this week to check it out and we're pretty impressed.   Firstly, the location is a bit weird being next to the motorcars collision center. Parking is limited and cramped, but they do have a decent drive thru to mitigate that.  The interior is clean and modern. They offer a small selection of drinks like kombucha, milk, and soda. They have a solid array of choices for donuts - not many by the time we went at noon, but even at that time when a lot of them had been picked clean they had a decent variety left.   My wife got a cinnamon while I got a raspberry cream bear claw (I'm drooling just thinking about it!) thay was, funnily enough, shaped like a bear claw. Both were absolutely delicious. The only complaint I had was that the filling in my bear claw was mostly settled on one side, by even the spots without any were amazingly good. My wife also got a caramel macchiato that she loved but I wasn't a fan of - it was much more bitter than what I normally go for.   Overall we loved everything from the food to the atmosphere. In fact, my wife just went back today for some delicious donut holes! We may make going a regular thing."}
{"text":"A little bit of sunshine to brighten everyone's morning - super stoked to have Daylight Donuts and Coffee in the Cleveland Heights neighborhood.  First off - they have awesome hours for those who have to get to work by 7:30-8AM every morning. It makes a huge difference when you know there's a donut and a coffee with your name on it as early as 6AM.   Secondly, I love how they always go out of their way to make my favorite donut - the Bavarian Creme. It may not be the most popular on-demand donut in town, but it sure is my favorite, and I've been on the hunt for a donut shop that makes it! At Daylight D&C, they are always happy and willing to go to the back kitchen to make a Bavarian Creme-filled glazed donut whenever I request one. Pair that with a steaming cup of the delicious Six Shooter coffee, and you have yourself a simply perfect caffeinated breakfast to start the work day."}
{"text":"Great place for donuts. Made fresh on a daily. With a cup of coffee is amazing........"}
{"text":"It's a good thing the donuts are cheap and good because they certainly don't have much going for them with regards to their customer service. It's an absolute joke how bad the service is at this place. I stood at the counter for several minutes before anyone acknowledged that I was there or asked for my order and there was no one else in line or in the store for that matter. They were just talking amongst themselves about personal matters. They might as well have been on their phones as well. I'm happy there is local donut place in the Heights and I want this place to do well, however this place will not last long unless they make vast improvements to their customer service. Best of luck to you guys, I hope things change here."}
{"text":"Daylight donuts has a really cool program. If you order after six all of the donuts are half off! That means a dozen donuts is usually about four dollars. Are usually get it for my family which really enjoyed the donuts they have very different flavors like fruity pebble's and cinnamon toast crunch and they also have Classix that we enjoy as well."}
{"text":"Visiting Cleveland  from Austin TX. Stopped by for breakfast and easily spent an hour or two here good coffee and great doughnut selection with acoustic music made for a relaxing morning .To the friendly workers who made us feel welcome , thank y'all"}
{"text":"The donut was very tasty (Lemon cheese bear claw) however, all of the filling was in the bottom  corner of the pasty, which was disappointing. I didn't pick any other donut because they looked dry/some are bite sized.   They use what I'm assuming is Thomas's brand  (store bought) bagels which was super disappointing, would expect higher quality from a pastry place.    Veggie wrap was delightful.  Staff is very nice, a little unorganized while taking orders. Very clean atmosphere and cute decor.   Would go again to support local business, I hope they continue to improve based on feedback"}
{"text":"I had the maple glazed donut and a cappuccino and sat in the shop for a few hours doing work. Donut was delicious and cappuccino up to par. Good ambiance, the chairs are ridiculously comfortable. Staff was somewhat loud, which I mostly noticed because I was doing work, but they were all very positive and really eager to help and kept the place clean despite the snow, ice, and salt consistently coming in. They seemed to take the morning rush in stride pretty well. Also took out a dozen donuts for coworkers all of whom said they were delicious! Glad that they serve other food too and excited try it out in the future. Did not go through their drive through and have not yet tried their other soups and sandwiches. When employees walked by they checked to make sure everything was ok which I appreciated and was just overall good customer service."}
{"text":"I did not think that a donut place could be better than certain...places...I'd found on the West Side.  I was wrong.  Daylight Donuts is located adjacent to Motorcars Collision services, and is a welcome and TASTY addition to Cleveland Heights. They have a large variety of donuts in both traditional and fun flavors like Fruity Pebbles and Cinnamon Toast Crunch (Oh, and the maple bacon creme sticks are the size of small battleships, kid you not!) In addition, they have great coffee, various types of sandwiches and soups, and...the ultimate breakfast sandwich... Sausage, egg and cheese...on a glazed donut! (Some may find this terrible, I had one; it was delicious:)   They also have a nice grouping of deli sandwiches, drinks and other treats, but their prices are really great, the service was wonderful...AND THEY HAVE A DRIVE THRU!    So, If you're looking for a place to get to when the sun comes up (They open at 7 AM most days,) then head over and get a box full of DAYLIGHT...donuts, that is!"}
{"text":"Honestly the daylight combo is such a great deal. 2 donuts and a coffee!!! I may become a regular here. I got the cake blueberry and old fashion and loved both of them!!!! Try them out, super affordable, great location, and delicious donuts!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited for a new coffee shop close to my home. Stopped by today hoping to grab some food and coffee and spend the afternoon getting some work done. Service was very friendly. A little slow as they're working out the kinks since they just opened but super friendly. Good coffee and a nicely portioned sandwich for $12. I ended up not staying because the only accessible outlet I saw was at the high top bar against the window. I needed a table to spread out a little and get my work done. They also have a drive through and a huge donut variety. While this won't become my go to coffee shop for working remotely, I can see it becoming a great quick drive through for coffee on my way to the office. Hope this little place stays around!"}
{"text":"This is where you go for a fresh, warm, crispy on the outside, moist on the inside old fashioned donut. Best in town for sure. I've tried the other specialty donuts but I don't like them as much... really at all. I stick the basics. Haven't had the yeast glazed donut yet but that'll be next. I'm sure it's good."}
{"text":"A bright addition to Cleveland Hts with rave reviews. Opened early in 2018, Daylight is clean and brightly decorated with classic and modern touches. They have a drive thru and they serve great coffee. It is bright and windowy inside.  Let's be clear: until 2018, there were no donut shops in Cleveland hts. Daylight is the 2000-teens answer to Crispy creme. Classic, fresh donuts with fresh new twists. Blueberry, orange marmalade, cinnamon cream in addition to the standards: chocolate glazed, sour cream, glazed, fruit filled. They have a donut with fruity pebbles sprinkles.  No kidding.  Service is good. Parking is plentiful. Enter on Monticello. These guys were smart for locating here: we needed it and it didn't exist and they did it! Bravo. A big hit to start 2018!"}
{"text":"We have been there a few times and my kids love their donuts. However the service at the counter this past time was something to write in on. I was appalled. I normally never give bad reviews but the man who worked in the morning on 4/6 at around 10am needs to go!! I have two small children who are very well behaved but at the end of the day...they are kids....there are tons of donuts..many of them marketed for kids enjoyment-ie fruity pebbles, lucky charm toppings etc! It's going to happen that kids may touch the glass and they shouldn't be yelled at by a stranger for doing so. He didn't just gradually say \"get off the glass kids\" it was a scolding! My one son looked like he was going to cry. As I was handing him the money to pay for their donuts, that he just assumed were going on a to go bag, and once I told him we were eating there he put one in a bag one on a plate?! He then looked away from me and yelled again at my one son who had his back to the glass and gradually had brush up on the glass. This time I turned to my kids and asked them not to touch the glass and to go sit down. I then looked at the man and said \"that is my job to tell them not to touch the glass if you have an issue\" he didn't say anything back. They are 4 and 5 and barely touching this precious glass. If anything they leaned up against it for a split second. They weren't hanging all over, slobbering it up.  What really made me write this was that in the 10 mins we were there eating, I saw him do it to another child!! The parent with that child seemed taken back as well. It's ridiculous and rude. If an employee can speak to customers that way, especially children you better believe we won't be supporting this establishment anymore. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Fun donut options! Service seemed \"in training\" but trainees had great attitudes vs manager making things a little awkward. Delicious donuts, worth the trip"}
{"text":"Was my first time and the place is so clean, crisp, and relaxing! The couches are cozy and I could spend all day there! I came in to get a few donuts and left with almost a dozen! The owner is so kind and offered me some extra donuts to try, which I really appreciate! The cappuccino was way better than anticipated, not your average mom and pop donut shop! The prices are reasonable and the donuts are amazing! Highly recommend supporting a local business this great!"}
{"text":"Soooo finally got to try this spot and it's aight. Has a cool little hipster vibe going on. The donuts were amazing. I tried the maple bacon donut and I'll def buy another one.  The coffee is pretty decent also. White Mocha is a go to and the dark roast coffee was ok.   They still have some kinks to workout but that's expected from a new spot."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place! Fully equipped with modern, comfortable sofa and chairs. Free WiFi and an all around awesome atmosphere.   The general mamager is pretty awesome! We went in and ordered some donuts, coffee and a sandwich.   Donuts were delicious. My favorite was the cream cheese cake and the blueberry cake donuts. Cannot go wrong with the classics.   They also serve six shooter coffee witch is incredible! So full of flavor.   We ordered the beef sandwich. It was delicious.  The horseradish sauce, hot sauce mixture was on point!  While speaking with the GM. He offered us donut holes and a taste of their slaw. Which comes on the corned beef sammich.   After that one taste, we needed to order one. It was insanely good.   The customer service was incredible. Everyone had a smile on their face and an awesome attitude. The shop was clean and smelled amazing. Can't wait to hear back for an ice cream filled donut.   Don't wait! Just go!"}
{"text":"I am so excited for a donut and drive-thru coffee place on my way to work.  However, I think I'll have to wait at least a couple of months for them to work out the kinks before going again.   First visit, ordered an iced coffee in the drive-thru, waited a long time, and were handed a hot coffee instead. When we asked, \"sorry I ordered an ICED coffee,\" the employee just handed us a straw?? We just took it, since we didn't want to be late to work.   Second visit, wanted to purchase a couple dozen donuts for work, but was told that no glazed donuts were prepared yet.   I think after they get in their stride, this will be a great place. The location is great, the interior is very nice, and the employees were all very friendly."}
{"text":"Great coffee!  Sour cream donuts are good.  Other donuts are pricey for what you get.  Sandwiches looked good, but also pricey.  Drive thru is SO convenient!   I drive past twice a day but only stop a couple times a month."}
{"text":"Cool place! On Monday, I had a huge craving for donuts, so I decided to try this place. I loved the interior- bright, modern and cozy! I also liked big windows through what you can observe the street.  Ok next, donuts... oh my! I ordered just two, and both of them were delicious! So, I ended up with ordering two extra! Lol!  Prices are great- basic donut 1$, fancy donut- 2.49$. Besides, I drank latte, that was prepared well.  I would like to give 5 stars... but my cup was a little bit dirty... ups!  Yet, it's a great place if you crave for a donut!"}
{"text":"Went today for first time. Staff was very pleasant. My caramel macchiato was good. My old fashion donut was just meh and actually dry. The krueller I got with chocolate icing was good and fresh. Overall impression is good but wouldn't go out of my way for a visit."}
{"text":"The donuts are Delicious!!! Seriously, they're so so good! I have been two times and both times my order has been messed up. I have gotten the wrong donuts both times and been over charged/missing donuts. Hopefully they workout the kinks and from now on, if I go back, I will be going inside and not through the drive thru."}
{"text":"I'm so excited for this place. I love donuts so any time a new donut shop pops up I'm all for it. I went a little late in the day so there wasn't a huge selection left but we still had a bit of a choice. I got the cinnamon bear claw and my sister got a blueberry doughnut. The bear claw was ok but it wasn't fully cooked in the center, which was disappointing. But my sister enjoyed her blueberry doughnut. Next time I will try another flavor and perhaps go earlier in the day. Staff was friendly and the atmosphere is nice. Overall it seems like a great place so far."}
{"text":"Since the business removes the less favorable reviews from their FB page I'll leave mine here. I ordered a large caramel macchiato and donut. They had very limited menu offerings, which I get it...it was the first official day of business and they were working out the kinks. Donut was very good but also small for being $2. Coffee was $5 and the size of a Starbucks grande (medium) and VERY syrup-y. Starbucks is even cheaper! Daylight is way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Love everything about this cute place from the awesome staff to the comfy seating, great coffee, fresh donuts, creative sandwiches and espresso milkshakes! And if that wasn't enough, the coffee sleeves are hilarious. Easy parking too.   Thanks Mike and everyone at DD&C! I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try this relatively new spot. Ordered some donuts and a white mocha to go. Donuts were nothing special, sorry. The white mocha was so gross: overly syrupy and just not well made. Prices are a little steep. Additionally, I just don't like the location. It's not ideal to get in/out of off of Monticello. On the plus side, the inside is quaint and clean. Pretty disappointing experience."}
{"text":"3.75 stars overall. Staff was friendly and helpful and the store is cleanly styled and very modern. They just opened around 4 weeks ago! I also learned they have a drive through.  Got a dozen donuts. Regular donuts are anything with holes. Special ones can be substituted for 2 normal donuts. Some of the specials didn't look to be worth it based on size alone.  The donuts are cake based. Pretty good fry of the dough. The inside was dense, generally moist and not too dry. The toppings were interesting though I personally liked their simpler ones better. Some of the donuts weren't the prettiest though, on the bottom or under the frosting... But still just as delicious!  Would definition come back! Love to support local business and glad to have a donut shop near Coventry."}
{"text":"Donuts are delicious and fresh. My only concern and this was my second trip is they don't put enough cream inside the donuts. Other than that I love the place.please put more cream inside. Took a few bites to get to it, and this was all my friends that I shared the donuts with.  Linda S Visited on 2/17/18"}
{"text":"Donuts are nothing special and coffee is like any other, but not the cheap burnt kind. Definitely new and clean. The powder donuts just tasted like sugar and not the smooth,doughy type. The glazed donuts were good, but could be more doughy and not as crispy/fried. It has lots of space which is nice for big groups and the service was just okay. Nothing too special for my taste. Will say the atmosphere and space is nice and clean!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Grabbed a half dozen from Daylight this morning and some coffee! These donuts rock. They are thick, heavy and flavorful.  Walking in, the atmosphere is sleek, clean and fresh looking! I great way to wake up and feel refreshed.  The employees were friendly, helpful and polite.  I got some amazing favors of donuts- cake, sour cream, fruity pebbles, chocolate cereal, strawberry and blueberry! All are amazing.  It was $11 for 6 donuts and 2 large coffees- I'd say it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan, been there about 10 times.  Very convenient drive-thru, clean and modern inside.   Lost a star for hit or miss customer service.    On one occasion I ordered a sandwich and after waiting 15 mins I reminded them about it, as nothing had come up.  The lady that took my order stared at my with a blank face, thought about it, and turned around to make it.  I laughed it off, but it was a little awkward that she didn't say anything.  On another occasion I asked if there was anything that a bagel sandwich could be put in (to-go) other than the plastic containers.  Due to the heat, by the time I get to the office to eat it, the bagel is soggy/sticky.  The drive-thru agent was friendly and agreed with me, but said \"no that's all we can do\".   Lastly, and this is a bit picky, but I ordered two chocolate donuts in the drive-thru.  When I got to work I realized they were indeed chocolate, but chocolate covered in nuts -- which I'm allergic to.  I'll take the blame, I should've checked the donuts, but perhaps the staff should have a process for verifying we're on the same page about the item.  Love the coffee and will continue to visit, but hoping staff improves or they hire some folks with a bit better judgement."}
{"text":"Cute modern place and busy on a cold sunny day at 1 o'clock. Donutholics coming and going...some eating in....some carrying out. Nice selection of donuts and sandwiches.  I came especially for the donut sandwich, and oh, so worth it.  Came with egg and sausage on a glazed cake donut cut in two.  A raised glazed donut is an option.  That and Ethiopian coffee hit the spot.  Nice window counter seats, or table and chairs. Very family friendly."}
{"text":"I just had a Cinnamon Toast Crunch donut from here and it might have been the greatest thing I've ever eaten.  The downtown turkey sandwich was also really good.  This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Returned to give the donuts and staff a second chance.   Tried the cruller and an iced coffee.   The cruller was fantastic, sticky and sweet and the coffee was yum.   The staff was better organized and dealt well with a fussy customer who was trying to bicker with them about the doughnut flavors.  A few days later I returned to grab a caramel milkshake and used the drive thru.   The milkshake was super good and the guy working the drive thru was chipper and helpful."}
{"text":"Fantastic donuts. Great atmosphere, helpful staff, and great donuts!! One of the better donut places in the area. I liked the sour cream one alot, which surprised me.  Worth the trip, try them out."}
