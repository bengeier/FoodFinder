{"text":"This place is OK but not mind blowing.  The menu is large and the price is very affordable, but the food felt average to me.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing considering the pancakes and waffles looked amazing, but I walked out not feeling like I had to go back anytime soon.  if I have one recommendation, it's to try one of the fancier, over the top, items on the menu... they looked very good from afar and based on the other reviews I think they might be the key to making this place a 4 or 5 star."}
{"text":"I love this place. Cute.Quaint. Friendly. A real neighborhood feel.  The food is always satisfying and what you would expect to be traditional fare is given a twist of some sort. Yum."}
{"text":"It is both a blessing and a curse when you sit down at a restaurant for the first time and you can already tell you will be back based on the fact that everything seems to appeal to you before you've tasted anything. Such is the case with me and Three's Company Catering.  Did you get all your Furly and Roper jokes out of the way? I'll wait and then we can move on...  Good. Instantly the Cream of Tomato Soup with a Grilled Cheese Sandwich jumped at me - the perfect comfort lunch that doesn't weigh you down no matter how much butter is used to crisp that bread. It felt weird going to a new brunch place and not ordering my standard brunch dish (eggs, bacon, home fries and such) but like I said, there will be other visits! I just couldn't resist the allure of the grilled cheese.  The place is very cute - small and decorated with what I can only assume are the professional photos that come with frames when you buy them from Blacks, but the nice ones not the dated graduation portrait ones. The server was very pleasant despite the Saturday 11am rush that comes with all brunch spots.  This place has definitely reserved its spot on my brunch rotation. Welcome!"}
{"text":"Three's Company is a small restaurant on Danforth at the Pape subway station. It's also a catering business which a volunteer group I belong to have used with great success.  For sure it's a nice homey place with an open kitchen so you can see what's going on. It's a great place to go for lunch or dinner any day; Sunday brunch is my usual time to eat out... and most of the time go to Three's Company. If you can go early then great, any time after 11:30 there will often be a bit of a lineup. Good sign right!  Carolyn and Teri are terrific and most of their staff have been with them for a long time so know what they're doing.  Order anything - it's terrific. I'm more traditional so go with eggs; bacon and toast but my partner and friends are often more adventurous (like their pulled pork poutine with egg), and have never been disappointed.    Their plates are generous, made to order and top quality. And if you need a variation (cheddar vs. feta is my common request; honey vs. sugar for tea is one of my friends), they will do their best to accommodate.  Three's Company is worth visiting again and again."}
{"text":"We decided to try somewhere new today and this restaurant was a happy midpoint for all of us.  Make no mistake, the restaurant is small and very busy for weekend brunch.  It took about 20 minutes to get a table for four at 11.30 and by the time we left around 1 the lineup was substantial so get there early or prepare to wait.  The food selection was very intriguing and there were maybe three or four things that I was torn about ordering.  I ended up with the southwestern eggs which were tasty but a little overpowering \"salsa\" wise.  I would really say they were closer to a neapolitan albeit a spicy neapolitan.  Also the tortilla chips were out of a bag and that was a little disappointing.  Still I would go back and try some of the other items including the eggs Bennie on a cheese scone and the poutine with an egg (officially making it a legitimate breakfast food).  Service was friendly but a little overwhelmed it seems.  Still I would go back."}
{"text":"I had read good things about this delightful eatery on The Danforth at Pape Avenue and a few months ago had the chance to check it out with my Mom and her husband. We weren't disappointed. Three's Company is a small resto/catering business. Luckily, a table had just opened up minutes before we arrived so we were seated right away.  The reason I was drawn to Three's Company is because I had read they serve their poached eggs on a cheese scone. Couldn't resist giving it a try. It was so scrumptious. My step-Dad tried the South Western Eggs - 2 eggs poached in Salsa and garnished with Avocado, Cilantro, Green Olives and Tortilla Chips. It was a unique brunch meal. I believe my Mom went for the quiche. Three's Company is worth visiting again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. I've been here three Saturday mornings and always great food and great service. Nice fresh breakfast and definately not greasy like a Sunset Grill or Tulip. All three times I've been offered different specials not on the menu. Located right at Pape and Danforth pretty well."}
{"text":"There's usually a lineup when I walk by this place on Sunday mornings, so that's what drew us in for brunch.  I had the Three's Company Big Breakfast - a generous pile of food that was all delicious.  Everything was going well until my wife discovered a long strand of hair in her omelette. One look at the kitchen area and it was no surprise - no one was wearing a hair net. They may want to consider investing in some, as they're not that expensive and they'll help to prevent some embarrassing moments and poor reviews.  The waitress apologized and offered to replace the meal, but my wife was too put off to have another bite.  If not for the hair, I would have given a higher rating."}
{"text":"So I says to Mabel I says this is one of my favourite brunch spots in Toronto. It's super cute (read: there's not many tables), it's got a sassy menu (they make bold statements. I dig that), and they slap their eggs benny on top of cheese biscuits. That to me is an instant winner, although upon further inspection, I don't love the combination as much as I thought I would. Did it once, enjoyed it at a 75% success rating and then moved on to something amazing-er: eggs poached in salsa with avocado and cilantro, served with tortilla chips. Now we're talking.  There are other things on the menu I've always wanted to try, but I haven't been able to move on from the salsa eggs. One day my gaping maw will inhale the homemade granola or the french toast prepared with croissants dipped in vanilla bean batter (does that still exist?); maybe I'll even try one of the daily specials.   It should be noted that the pancakes taste like vanilla cupcakes, and you may be tempted to buy a baked good sitting pretty in the display as you leave. Also, it helps to get there before 11, otherwise stroller armies start to line up out the door!"}
{"text":"This is a feel good kinda neighborhood restaurant. Went there for Sunday brunch with girlfriends. I ordered the eggs benny with spinach. Eggs were placed on cheese scone- nice touch. Mix of sweet potatoes and potatoes were roasted with herbs... Not your average mash."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED: This a small casual place on the popular Danforth and a few steps from the Pape subway station. It's a small storefront restaurant and tiny open kitchen offering up inventive fare for breakfast, lunch and dinners. Dinner is served Wed-Sun only (I believe). This is also a good brunch location (though expect a short wait). Top quality offerings, friendly service, interesting menu combinations and easy access make this a good casual choice for visitors and locals alike."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I walked down the Danforth for Saturday morning brunch at Three's Company. The waiter, Will, was first to greet us. He was light-hearted, fun and engaging. The small community atmosphere is awesome. Everyone seems to know each other. We enjoyed chatting with another family nearby. The food! Incredible. Best omelette of my life - and I've eaten many omelettes. The chefs are very good. I wanted to stay and keep eating.  We ordered another latte to go - their latte machine is like magic. All smiles and laughs, we'll be returning soon. It was a highlight of our weekend together."}
{"text":"It's dream come true: poutine topped with pulled pork AND a fried egg."}
{"text":"I was a little let down by the breakfast here.   First: they don't have the regular eggs, bacon, toast, homefries breakfast. You sort of have to cobble it together from some other breakfasts, which they're happy to do. The Hubster had that and seemed pretty happy with it. I ordered the eggs benedict, but they only serve it on cheddar scones so I ended up having it on toast instead, which isn't quite the same as an english muffin. The hollandaise also comes from a mix, which is probably normal for most places, I don't know. The homefries were also a bit underdone, so the potatoes were hard. Breakfast for two ended up being about $30, which is a bit much.  That being said, the service was really great and the small orange juice is actually a half-pint, as opposed to most places that serve their small juice in eyedroppers. Maybe it was just an off day in the kitchen, as the reviews are good and the place was highly recommended by a local."}
{"text":"Three's Company has the misfortune of being located *just* that little bit East of Pape on the Danforth that many people don't consider part of the Danforth 'strip' and only venture that way when they know there is somewhere good to go.   I live East of Pape, just off the Danforth, so I have actually walked by this place every day for the last two years and have always noticed it, but never ventured in.   On Saturday and Sunday mornings, it is always busy. I noted this to be a good thing, though we all know how busy doesn't always mean good a la Pizzeria Libretto...   Annnyway, my Husband and I decided to check it out this past Sunday for brunch. It was wonderful. They have brunch specials on the weekend, as well as their regular brunch menu. It's not a huge restaurant, so depending on when you arrive, you might have to wait a few minutes, but the wait is worth it.   I had the eggs florentine. As anyone who enjoys a good eggs benedict or florentine knows, it can either be great or downright terrible and there's not much in between. This was was phenomenal. Great hollandaise sauce AND instead of the eggs being atop your average english muffin, they are served across an in-house made cheese scone. Wonderful.   My husband had a more daring (but equally delicious dish) called Southwestern Eggs. The poaches eggs were served in a spicy salsa with tortilla chips! Both of our dishes were served with excellent homemade potatoes as well.   One noteworthy thing is that the portions are the most \"normal\" I have seen in a restaurant in a long time. I didn't have to take any away with me and I wasn't uncomfortably full when I finished my brunch. Kudos to the chefs for keeping the portions healthily sized.   I also noted that the menu has a number of sweet dishes too. Some really abundant french toasts and waffle dishes jumped out at me, but since I am currently \"eating for two\", I've been opting for the more balanced approaches to food. When baby arrives, I'll be sure to get back on the sugar-high wagon I love!   Finally, if you're looking for a place with unbelievable decor and ambiance, don't go here. Or do and don't complain about the decor and ambiance. It's a comfortable, brunchy place, not Nota Bene.   If you've seen my review on La Cabana you know I love the restaurants that serve unbelievably good food without all the frills of a fancy resto. I love a fancy resto once in a while too, but I know you can't have it all and I'd rather have great food at reasonable prices. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"this place sits a few doors down on the danforth from pape on the southeast side.  it is the restaurant for the catering business from which it stems.  the food here is the strongest component, which is pretty fine by me.  the environment of the restaurant, though welcoming through its staff and appearance seems a little slapped together without much interest.  to clarify, i was sitting right at the front of the place, where, at its window overlooking the danforth sits two high darkly stained square tables with high stools to match.  call it trendy, cool, whatever, but it looks great, gives you a warm comfortable and unpretentious feeling.  my table (which sat adjacent to the one i just described) along with the tables that followed behind it towards the back were covered with some cheap plastic like cover that felt and looked gross.  bad idea.  no coherence here.  as well at the front on the bar, sat a couple trays of beautiful looking pastries; as you walk in there was a nice welcome sign, etc., but one glance towards the back made you feel like there was nothing beyond your positioning right now worth exploring.  i say do it for the whole as a whole or dont do it at all.  the food choices were really exciting however.  take the poutine for example.  it involved the classic fries, gravy and (mozzarella) cheese with pulled pork and a fried egg on top.  i didnt order that (i had fries the day before, felt guilty, etc.) but i saw someone else who ordered it and it looked scrumptious.  i will definitely order it next time around.  i had a version of eggs benny, called eggs benjamin with a crumpet instead of the english muffin, and smoked salmon instead of back bacon (i still ordered bacon anyway on the side...might as well have ordered the poutine, i discovered as i licked bacon grease off my lips).  i prefer the english muffin, actually;  the crumpet was too dry - perhaps thats what crumpets are supposed to be like.  the accompanying potatoes, both normal spuds and sweet ones were great.  my wife had some scrambled eggs that were actually steamed eggs done by the steamer on an espresso machine. pretty cool and pretty healthy.  i would definitely come back again and try other stuff.  and make sure i park myself at one of the cool tables upfront."}
{"text":"Worst brunch ever.  We were very excited to try this place but were very disappointed.  I had the southwest eggs which are poached in salsa.  Sounds delicious but I didn't expect the vinegar/salsa soup bowl that was presented to me.  Other than the occasional hit of cilantro you could not taste anything else.  the eggs disappeared into the tomatoey vinegar sauce and the lime tostidos on the side did nothing to sop it up.  I would have complained to the server but he was nowhere to be seen during the meal.    I thought about giving a 2star rating because much of the food at neighbouring tables looked pretty good.  But the feeling of acidic nausea i left with prevents me from doing so."}
{"text":"Any place that has fresh raspberry iced tea (we're talking NEON magenta here - ripe raspberries to the max) is a winner in my heart. Not enough places have flavoured iced tea, period, let alone freshly made. It was outstanding.   Three's Company is a cute little 'co-op'-y brunch spot just outside Pape station on the Danforth. The menu was a bit ramshackle with lots of varied options that all called out to me, but my test brunch item is always Eggs Florentine served on a cheese scone instead of an English muffin. Yum!   It looked absolutely fantastic but there was way too much spinach. And when I say \"way\" I mean ten to fifteen times the amount of cooked spinach one would normally put on an eggs benny. I had to wipe it off with a knife and the leftover spinach covered half of my plate.   I'm fairly particular about my wilted spinach - in fact, I'd prefer it just be zapped for the tiniest amount of time; even raw baby spinach would be good - but this was too much. It was mushy and overbearing.   The homefries were a delight - cubed white and sweet potatoes that were perfectly roasted and salt/peppered.   I think I might have caught Three's Company on an off day - slow service (took forever to get the bill) and the spinach overload were turnoffs, but I'd definitely go back and give it another chance thanks to the spectacular menu options! Definitely has five star potential."}
