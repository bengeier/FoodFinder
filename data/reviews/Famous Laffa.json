{"text":"One of the best shawarmas I've had in Toronto so far. The service is usually really fast but it can get pretty crowded during lunch time. I always order the white laffa with shawarma but they also have a whole wheat version. Overall 5/5"}
{"text":"Omg this resturant is one of the worst resturant iv ever bin at,  I ordered chicken brest with rice and My friend ordered stake with baked potato. When we got the order after 25 minutes the chicken was under cooked and the rice was half hard and my friends stake was dry and smothered with oil and the potato was cooled. And if that's not bad enough when we complaind to the owner and the owner said he'll deal with it and he turned his head and started screaming at the server I felt so bad for her she did nothing to deserve to be yelled at over all it was a disturbing experience"}
{"text":"Fresh Pita bread and Laffa made for each order. The food is very fresh too.
We ordered chicken Shish Pita and a Laffa Kebab. Both are delicious. Service is nice and so is the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Laffa is great and humus was not bad - this is the only thing was Ok about this place.
We ordered soup of the day that was for sure made from the canned food and chicken schnitzel was dry and fresh. 
Not recommending it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have never been so dissapointed by the service in a restaurant. The employees were acting as if they didn't want to be there and taking it out on the customers. The food was just okay. Nothing special. I was at this location prior to going to the promenade location and never knew at restaurant with the same name could have such a drastic difference!"}
{"text":"Great laffa. Shawarma is giant, enough for 2 people if you don't want to feel stuffed."}
{"text":"Loved the babaganuch. The laffas were packed and so filling. Had to pack them away. They were out of shawarma by 7pm, which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Food was delicious , portions are more than enough, u get laffa bread which is fresh and very tasty, prices reasonable, good service"}
{"text":"I tried the sabich plate which is off the appetizer menu. It has a tabbouleh, babaganoush, a fried eggplant and something tomatoes based with lots of herbs and spices which was a bit salty and I couldn't very much of that. I would probably get extra babaganoush next time instead of that one. Which is saying something considering I like salty foods. It also comes with 4 sabich or 4 falafel and a large laffa. I opted to try two falafel and two sabich. It was my first experience with sabich and they were excellent. Everything on the plate was so delicious. I preferred the sabich over the falafel so I would stick to those next time. The sabich were perfectly crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside and infused so perfectly with herbs. The babaganoush was \"omg go good\". If your vegan as them not to put on any egg as they put a sliced egg on top. Hmm what else... The falafel and sabich were also freshly prepared. 
Cost is $10.99 plus tax. IMO definitely with it as you get to try several different items. I ate it all myself but I think it's meant more for sharing. 
They let me sample the bean soup and the barley soup. I would recommend the bean for sure flavour wise. I think the barely had a little too much lemon, but I'm not totally sure... But Maybe it's meant to be that way. 

The place is clean and the cooks keep a nice clean work area. I could see from the take out area.

All in all, thoroughly enjoyed. I sat in the take out area but I would probably go upstairs to the dining area next time.  
Will definitely come back and get a big bowl of the bean soup next time."}
{"text":"Been to Dr Laffa and this place is just as good. I'm guessing they have the same foods, same company. Ordered 2 laffa shwarma with fries for a sit down and headed up stairs to sit. 

The place is empty, not sure why great food. Got my food with in 5 minutes,  very quick. Fresh and good tasting I recommend the shwarma, one of the best in Toronto if not the best. I wouldn't come for anything else really."}
{"text":"Absolutly love the shawarma here! Its huge! Havent been able to eat the whole thing in one time. I love the fact they make the bread fresh in front of you. Some people here say the meat wasnt fresh, but i always ask for a fresh cut and never got turned down. I also like the fact that the place is kept very clean and their service is very fast and professional, have been here about 6-7 times already and its always great tasting."}
{"text":"I didn't even know what a laffa was before setting foot in here. This place is well hidden behind the Real Canadian Superstore plaza by Dufferin and Steeles. Accordingly to my Jewish friends, this is THE place for laffas. 

Okay, what is a laffa? It is actually the type of bread that is used to wrap the shawrma. It is thicker than the normal pita and definitely a lot chewier. The laffa is also much bigger than a pita, so my friend and I was able to share a chicken laffa shawarma for lunch. 

You also have a lot of options with the fillings. Most are similar to a typical sharwma place, but two fillings that stand out are the homefries and eggplant. Make sure to add those to your sharwma and you will not regret it. 

Overall, this is not a fancy restaurant, but more of a diner sort of place. The service is quick and efficient, which is what I expect of a place like this. The food is amazing and that's definitely why I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"A fairly limited review since I just did a takeout order of their hummus with ground beef and pine nut appetizer.

It wasn't the cheapest price ($13), but it was fairly large in the end which made the value a little better. The hummus had a great taste and was very smooth. It could've used a little more garlic for my taste, but still pretty good. I really liked the freshly baked flatbread.

I did find the beef a bit disappointing. I was there well after dinnertime, and it was clearly a couple hours from its prime. I also felt the pine nuts could've been cooked a little more, but that could be more to taste.

A mixed experience. Enough to warrant another try - in all likelihood ordering the item that is their namesake; but I had still hoped for more."}
{"text":"WHAAAT? It closed? Damn it, this had the best laffa falafel and it was HUGE! I'm so sad boo hoooo"}
{"text":"This is the first time I visit famous Laffa ever since it changed its name and I am glad to report that the food is as good as before although I just had a pita with sabih it was still fresh and tastey and generous. 
They completely changed the place and I have no idea why but it's good to see them back in business."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Famous Laffa - I usually patron Dr. Laffa on Magnetic Drive, but haven't been in a while.  I was surprised to find out that they had changed their name to Famous Laffa, but pleased that they had a franchise only units away from my dentist's office :)

We were greeted immediately and served with a smile.  My husband and I ordered a chicken shawarma Laffa and a falafel Laffa - both whole wheat, both to share, both for $20. Whole wheat Laffa crisps up better than the white. Toppings were colourful, plentiful and fresh, portions were abundant and yummy.  

This location's quality is consistent with what I remember of the Magnetic Drive location. I will definitely patron again when in the area."}
{"text":"Was pretty disappointed after my experience at this location. They were out of shwarma!  WHAT!? To me, a restaurant that is known for their shwarma should be able to serve it's customers shwarma (maybe my expectations are too high but i doubt it).

 I'm giving the review 4 stars because our server was really amazing and tried her best to fix the issues with our order very kindly. Also, I know that they have done better in the past. Their food (shwarma) is consistently good, and the staff are very caring. 

I ordered the charbroiled kebab (by default), and it was very disappointing. I've had the shwarma before, and it's amazing. The kebab laffa was practically empty, and the laffa seemed to be gummy and undercooked. The vegetables inside were awfully cold, and lacking. The kitchen mixed up the sandwiches my party ordered: one with no onions the other with onions. That's a bad mistake to make when you get a customer who hates onions!!

Our waitress took the sandwich off the bill and apologized kindly. She brought a complimentary soup over to the table. It was very thoughtful and she was very responsible all in all. 

Don't go to this location for anything but the shwarma, and if they are out, I wouldn't reccomend a different samdwich."}
{"text":"Authentic Israeli food from the family that run Sima restaurant in the incredible Mahane Yehudah market in Jerusalem.  Shawarma, pargiyot (dark chicken skewers), kebab all fantastic.  Rib steak good.  Fried eggplant slices also very good.  Hummus tasty.  Provide 4 salads to start on the house, nice touch.  Still waiting for an Israeli restaurant that provides unlimited small salads for a fixed fee, like in Israel.  Whole wheat and regular Laffa very tasty.  Food here tastes the closest to Israel outside of Israel."}
{"text":"Overall very disappointed.  Was happy to see this new middle eastern place..... But after one try have no reason to return. I don't wish anyone bad, but would be surprised if they are still in business within the next 12-18 months!!

prices are in the higher end for a place like this! Average about $20-25 a person. 

First, I ordered \"Humus Full\"...... Sorry, we no longer offer everything offered on the menu?????? What.. They just opened! Why not black out what's not available? 

Then, I asked for water.... Arrived in a junior glass.... Waitress had to refill like 9 times.... What a waste of energy. 

Ordered Shakshuka....  It was very watery and okay flavour. 

Laffa was fresh and nice. humus with chickpeas was lovely. 

Jerusalem mix and Shwarma was just okay. 

Service was friendly, and I could see they were trying..... But veeeerrry slow and could see they had no clue. Food took about 35 minutes to arrive. 

Turkish coffee was gross.... I couldn't even drink it!! Tasted salty. 

Parking is very tight, but the final kicker is that looking into the cooking area, things looked somewhat dirty. 

With so many other options around town, I doubt they will survive. I certainly have no reason or desire to return."}
{"text":"I am so glad to see this Laffa place in my neighborhood. Let me start of by saying that the staff is very polite and goes beyond to make your stay enjoyable. We ordered two chicken shawarma laffas ($10.99) and a side order of fresh cut fries ($5.99). You have an option of whole wheat and white for the laffa. We didn't wait for too long and the toppings to go along with our order were delicious and fresh tasting. All in all, it is worth coming here if you are in the area and you get not only quality, but quantity. We couldn't even finish our meal and had to take the rest to go. The place itself has room for sitting on the first level, but also a restaurant seating on the second floor. Parking is also available next to the establishment. We looking forward to our next visit soon."}
{"text":"I used to go to Famous Laffa on Magnetic Dr and the standard order would be a Shawarma on a Laffa.. But they closed down and turned it into a franchise..

Loved the fact that they would make the laffa for you on the spot with the Taboon - I think that's what it's called..

This place and the new one in the Promenade food court just doesn't have that awesome 4.5 star taste anymore...

It's a pretty big shawarma and you most likely won't finish it on a single sitting.. Especially if you order other stuff, such as the mushroom hummus which is also really good.

For the size that it is, $15 a shawarma isn't bad..because it will feed two small people..

Can't give it 4 stars anymore tho, cuz they just don't taste the same after becoming a franchise..

If I've never been to the \"original\", I would probably give it a 4 star..

Nowadays.. 3 stars.."}
{"text":"Awesome laffa shawarma. They really fill it up. Also their eggplant topping makes the shawarma a different beast. It seems pricy, but the portions are huge and you can easily share or have lots of left overs."}
{"text":"Yes
Dr Laffa is famous laffa 
Now franchising 
The location in dufferin and Steeles location closed April and has not reopened yet : for renovations 
If food is same 
It is THE place to go for hot fresh Laffa 
And anything you'd put
In it ;Israeli/middle eastern

Soon to open in the promenade 
Good news circa July 2015 now
Magnetic drive location under permanent construction 
Oh well. 
Oy vey 
Some day"}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service is beyond rude. I used to go here once a week, but the girl at the cash on her phone with the snarly face, the counter staff playing favourites, and the overall grim neglect of patrons means I won't be back."}
{"text":"Not as good, and not even close to the one on magnetic drive. I know this is the partner of the one in magnetic. The person handling cash, Aldo handled the laffa, which is a huge no no in food safety. I wouldn't be going back anytime soon. The shawarma instead of being freshly cut from the rotisserie it was held in a steam try. About 5 people where in the kitchen doing nothing. Hope this place improves in the near future."}
