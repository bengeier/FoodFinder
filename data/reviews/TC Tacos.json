{"text":"Giving this place a 1 star only because I can't choose 0 stars! I went here because of the reviews expecting an at least good if not great meal. What I received was crap. Besides the hair in my food, the meat was dry and the rice was artificial tasting. Besides the horrible food the price was way too over priced. I literally just shit my $29 dollars out. I would definitely NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Me and my husband decided to stop in this place for lunch and I am so glad we did cause the carne asada quesadilla was delicious, you can tell they use quality meat. My husband loved their smoky salsas. The staff was super friendly and engaged while we were sampling salsas. Definately check this place out."}
{"text":"Very clean pleasant little taco spot and very nice employees but they were totally stingy with the cilantro and lettuce.. I should of just gone to a taco truck were they don't care how much garnish I use..."}
{"text":"Wow, this is an outstanding unassuming little restaurant.  Food was delicious with a tasty salsa bar. Very friendly staff.......will definitely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"First time in and thought the place was well lit and clean. Place an order to go and watched other sit to dine in.  They were never help and eventually left. No servers, just the young lady taking orders."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here! Their pork quesadilla and chorizo breakfast burrito are my absolute favorites but honestly you can't go wrong with anything on their menu! Their service is great- family owned which I love! Also, their horchata is the best I have ever had hands down!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at TC Tacos and it did not disappoint! I ordered a breakfast burrito (eggs, cheese and potatoes) with avocado instead of meat. Wow! The tortilla was soft and warm, with the perfect balance of each ingredient. They have a great salsa bar as well, and both the mild salsa and tomatillo salsa were incredibly fresh and flavorful. The price and quality of this giant burrito can't be beat. I look forward to coming back and trying more menu items."}
{"text":"I've not had one thing here that wasn't delicious. All of the meats are excellent, the barbacoa and al pastor are my favorites. I usually get the taco plate with several kinds of tacos, even the refried beans and rice are better than your average Mexican restaurant. The house made salsa bar offers a good variety. Dining or grabbing to go you can't beat the price for the quality of what you are getting."}
{"text":"Food is very good here.  You can really tell that they have people who know meat as the smoked pork and chicken are very good.  Nice little find near home and near the LA Fitness."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when east coasters come to town. Fresh, delicious, and they smoke their own high quality meats. Their El Pastor is now legend in Philadelphia. Great for catering parties, too."}
{"text":"We order the guacamole and chips, and the chili rellanos. Yummy, and fast. The fresh salsa bar with a variety of salsas and crudites was also very good."}
{"text":"Thought this place was supposed to be 4.5 stars. The picture I saw of the taco salad had me drooling. Mine looked nothing like it, though. It was okay. Nothing special. \"Hot\" salsa was hardly spicy. Service was fine. Overall, just a mediocre taco shop that didn't stand up to the hype."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and salsa, and the BYOB is super fun! I went in with a bottle of champagne for a little family celebration. The owner was incredibly friendly and played with our baby. Great family friendly local spot!"}
{"text":"Paid for $30 for bland carne asada tacos. Who uses lettuce on carne asada?? Cabbage and purple onion would have got better!! Also, the owner was monitoring how many salsa cups were given to go.  Needless to say, if you are going to give me 4 small plastic cups of salsa for 6 tacos and then you complain because I ask for lids on my salsa.  Your customer service was horrible and you ran out to get plastic bags from the liquor store next door.  Will not return.  If I spend $30 on food, I should have salsa for all my tacos!! Especially since it was needed to cover up the bland taste of your tacos and rice!!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best taco shops I've eaten at I had shrimp tacos and my husband had al pastor and it was delicious .. Service was perfection as well"}
{"text":"Very clean pleasant little taco spot. I'm  PREGNANT  & craving a lot of things :) I went in last night 10/18th with my boyfriend. He was not too hungry so we thought of getting something small and trying out their burritos, Our thought was to get TWO orders of 2 taco kids meals for 5.99 each plus chips and salsa for 2.99 and a burrito and Fried Ice cream. I am PREGNANT and craving tacos and burritos and fried ice cream EVERYTHING.   i started off by ordering the kids meals and didn't even get to finish before the LADY i think Owner told me we CAN NOT Order kids meals because we are not kids. I try explaining to her that we are not too hungry and plus we are also ordering other things but couldn't even explain she cut me off by saying its only for KIDS your an adult.   It got me upset so i just told her thank you and we left and went somewhere else. It was my WORST EXPERIENCE there i think that anyone can order whatever they want to eat and its not fair and very rude and not even sure if its OK for her to reject my order. It was Horrible i will not be back . I been here before during the day and ordered a full meal and even desert, at night i do not eat as much and had a few cravings of course i was so MAD i wanted to cry my hormones. I will not be back to this place at all after they rejected my order!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 10:05 and were disappointed that the menudo was not ready which was the reason we went.  The horchata was not homemade and was on the sweet side with no hint of cinnamon. I had huevos a la mexicana and it was OK. The best item we ordered was the carne asada quesadilla. I will try it again to try their street tacos."}
{"text":"Surprisingly great Mexican. It's a strip mall taco shop, but the quality of the food was awesome. I had a variety of tacos and I would get them all again, but I think the barbacoa was my favorite. Check it out."}
{"text":"The marinated chicken here has got to be one of the best things I've ever tasted - not even exaggerating. The horchata was delicious and they had amazing service to go along with it. The guys working were so friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back, maybe weekly. Already looking forward to my next trip!"}
{"text":"The BF and I are in town for a wedding. We were hungry after a morning of light grocery shopping and decided to go here for late breakfast/early lunch. As soon as we walked in, we were quickly greeted. We got a plate of chips, guacamole, and salsa .  It was tasty. The salsa I would jar and pack it in my suitcase. It had this nice smoky flavor about it....yum!  The BF orders huevos rancheros. I order the 3 taco dinner with a variety of meats: barbacoa, smoked chicken, and all pastor (I think that's the name). The food was excellent . Of the three tacos, I have to say the barbacoa taco was my favorite. The man who greeted us recommended a salsa for each of the tacos.   We left very full. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos, and friendly staff.  I truly love this place because it's right down the street and it's great for a post-workout meal after I'm done at the L.A. Fitness across the plaza. Can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"First of all as a true hispanic, this place was nothing to brag about. The salsa was plain and had no kick to it. I had their carne asada burrito and the carne asada was also plain and was not juicy. Their chips were too salty. The only thing that was good about it was the water so I can wash it down. Finally it was wayyyyy over priced for the quality and taste. If you come here you might as well go to taco bell.The only thing nice about it was the interior of the place and the staff. I will never go back again."}
{"text":"This place is not good. The salsa is flavorless, the \"tacos\" are the size of silver dollars and the breakfast burrito I had consisted of old bacon and undercooked potatoes and a hint of eggshell. And $5 for an order of chips and salsa?!? No thanks. The people are nice and friendly but the food? No bueno."}
{"text":"This place is delicious, great service and even better food. You can tell the food has a lot of love behind it and everything taste fresh. There is a sauce for everything here, any kind of protein you order you got a delicious salsa to go with it. The man behind the counter helped you picked a sauce for each food you ordered. And it's BYOB with a liquor store next door! Check it out."}
{"text":"3 Taco dinner platter was out of this world. Get some alpastor and marinated chicken. best ive had in a long time.  Deep fried ice cream was yummy. Need Flan on the menu and i'd find a way to leave a 6th star."}
{"text":"This place has the legit true Mexico tacos. The spa ish rice is killer, the best around anywhere in Tempe! Try the chili rellenos..2 huge chilies stuffed with cheese and fried just right, rice and beans included. Order extra red sauce to make it complete. I like the salsa bar as well. Hard to see from the street. Just look behind pet Club next to the drive in liquor store."}
{"text":"Picked up dinner to go and was blown away by the shredded marinated chicken burrito. This shop just opened up so it is still in its beginning stages, but they are doing the most important thing right which is the quality of the food. The couple that owns the restaurant recently moved here from Canada. They are very friendly, helpful and know what they're dong. This place won't stay secret for long! If you are looking for delicious, top notch mexican food with a hint of spice and Canadian charm that won't break the bank, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos! The meat was amazing...and the service was incredibly fast.   The gent who served us I think was an owner and as amiable as they come. We only had the tacos but loved them.  Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic personal service and the meats are top-notch. Try the Mexican dry ribs - never tried anything like it and they were cooked to perfection. I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"This is the best place for street tacos! I come here all the time since I discovered it. BYOB makes for a cheaper date option. Would recommend it 10/10."}
{"text":"This is a BYOB restaurant and its great, there is a little liquor store right next door to go pick out your drinks while they make your great meal.  The chips and guacamole are a must, very flavorful.  The salsa bar is the best so many great options I had the chile relleno which were very good. The flavor and heat were great.   My friend had the Shrimp burrito and burn jalapeno. Both looked amazing and tasted the same.  I really enjoyed this place, the food was great, the people were amazing and the atmosphere was like you were getting a home made meal."}
{"text":"If you live in Tempe near the US 60 on Mill ave or nearby, and have never been impressed by authentic Mexican street tacos, you owe it to yourself to give this place a try. It is very special.  This little joint sits in a strip mall corner unit complete with a picture window that provides breathtaking views of a drive-thru liquor store. It is one of many local businesses alongside a 24 hour fitness club next to a pizza place. Unassuming and uncomplicated come to mind. The service is friendly and prompt. Glass bottled cane sugar sodas with Spanish language labels are kept ice cold in a retro-chic skinny coke machine behind the counter. Large jars of tea and aguas frescas (horchata and jamaica on my last visit) gently sweat away on the counter, all of it kept very clean. The menu board lists prices that compete with any of the ubiquitous yellow-sign 'Anybertos' that sum up the majority of authentic Mexican quick service fare in the Phoenix metro area.  That earns 3 stars. Why the other 2? This was quite simply one of the best meals I have ever eaten anywhere. They know their food is good, but allow it to speak for itself rather than boasting about how great it is.  Nearly everything is made in house, often from scratch, and ingredient not made there is carefully selected to reflect the same levels quality and authenticity (i.e. they only use Mexican cheese). The meats are all either grilled or smoked, and present a wide range of texture from chewy, crispy, crunchy, to tender, often in the same bite (best Al Pastor I've had ANYWHERE). While the meats are surprisingly light and non-greasy without being dry, this is probably not the best place for a diet, or a vegetarian.  I ordered a 3-taco dinner with Carne Asada, Pollo Adobado, and Al Pastor. The Carne Asada was fantastic, as good as any I've ever had. The Adobado and Al Pastor tacos immediately triggered that 'perfect bite' reflex; that moment where you just stop mid chew and slow down and savor every little detail, because your tastebuds are telling you you've found some of that really REALLY good stuff. The beans and rice seemed to be made with equal attention to detail. The refried beans were the most flavorful I've ever had. Not sure if they were using lard, but I could swear there was a faint cheese-like tang in there beyond the cheese melted on top.  I will be going back for dinner tomorrow. And probably the next night until I can try everything on the menu.  Pros: INCREDIBLE food from traditional recipes, great value, unpretentious and universally welcoming. BYOB and there's a liquor store with excellent beer/wine next door.  Cons: Sooner or later this place is going to get a visit and recommendation from a celebrity chef, and it will have a line. I wish they were open later."}
{"text":"Clean, warm atmosphere. I had the carne asada tacos with rice and beans, very yummy! They also have a salsa bar with a variety of salsas, I loved the salsa de chile de arbol, it has a nice kick. They also had food network playing on a flat screen tv that I watched while waiting for my take out order."}
{"text":"Just ordered free post mates tacos! Amazing definitely will be back soon to try more!"}
{"text":"Based on all the great reviews of this place I was excited to try it out...what a disappointment. I ordered the overpriced \"carne asada\" burrito ($8.65 w/tax) and I would be shocked if it was even 20% carne asada. It was loaded with so much beans, rice and pico (no guac) that you couldn't even taste the overly chewy carne asada."}
{"text":"This is what a Taco joint is all about!  While the decor is adequate, I believe some one put it as \"semi-hole in the wall\" and I think that's pretty accurate.  And please understand that is NOT a bad thing.  What this place might lack in ambiance it makes up for in spades with its food.  I had the Al Pastor, Smoked Chicken and Smoked Pork Tacos.  My favorite was the smoked pork, but any of the others were right up there with them.  I will be back to check their consistency, but I highly doubt there will be any issues."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Mexican food establishment. Their street tacos are mouthwatering. TC tacos always has friendly staff and is a family owned & operated business. Check em out."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, look no further.  -Staff is extremely friendly! Haven't felt this welcomed in a restaurant in a long time. -Carne Asada plate was delicious. Comes with mini tortillas which you can make some awesome tacos. Completely full and satisfied. -Relatively new place, definitely will be back.  EDIT: Our car's battery died, and the cook was so gracious enough to drive us to O'Reillys to get a new battery. What a guy! Kudos to their kindness and generosity."}
{"text":"We visited TC Tacos for lunch today. Our daughter had recommended this restaurant to us several months ago, so we were anxious to check it out. We ordered several different kinds of tacos and they were all delicious. The meats are smoked onsite and we loved each one we tried. The salsas were delicious as well. My husband has several food allergies and the server was very accommodating. We went next door and grabbed a dry Crispin Ale to eat with our food.  The owner was quite friendly in both the restaurant and the adjoining liquor store. There is no fee to bring a beverage over to the restaurant from the liquor store next door. The service was good and the owner chatted with us both in the restaurant and in the adjoining liquor store. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We went there today for lunch.  These tacos are the real thing, truly excellent!  And great and courteous service.  We'll be back here again."}
{"text":"Went with my Mom and Dad for breakfast.  I had the breakfast burrito with bacon.  We had chips and salsa also. Fresh and yummy!  Burrito was very tasty and a good size.  Left feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Just was not a huge fan. I ordered 3 street tacos.  Barbacoa, smoked pork a smoked chicken.  I was not crazy about any of them. The guacamole and chips were the best part of the meal.  I'll stick to my favorite hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Super friendly service! Very family friendly and polite. My boyfriend and I LOVE the carne asada tacos  If you want great Mexican food this is the place to be! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place... WOW! Where do I even begin? Okay, first of all, this place has the absolute best guacamole and chips, made in-house and served fresh a little while after being seated. My wife went to the bathroom before we ate, and she said it was really clean and nice, which is a definite plus. My wife and I both had the grilled fish street tacos, and these are, no lie, the absolute best fish tacos either of us have ever had... And we honeymooned in San Diego, the haven of fish tacos! And, to top it all off, the bill was super cheap too! I seriously can't rate this place highly enough. I'd give it 100 stars if I could. My wife asked if we could \"come here for dinner too?\" and, at the time, I laughed... but now I'm totally considering it lol. All in all, this place is the best, and I'm really glad we came here."}
{"text":"OKAY, I'm not one to really complain but WoW how did this place get so many stars, I had a large order. Repeated multiple times with the young girl at the front. A nice girl I don't blame her. The order was wrong and incomplete twice. The owner who was there couldn't even be bothered to come out he let this teenager try and fix his mistakes. Poorly ran with medicore food."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and service. The three taco dinner was delicious. Carne asada tacos were my favorite ones. Will definitely be back again! The fact you can do BYOB is super awesome as well!"}
{"text":"BYOB!! Okay let me put it down plain and simple Yelpers! Flame broiled and smoke meats makes this place authentic street style tacos like you would taste in Los Angeles. Yeah the beans and rice are 50% but please understand that beans and rice are nothing more than fillers in Mexican food. This place is all about tacos but it serves a wonderful full flare of dinner plates like Chili Rellenos,Pollo Adobado,Fajitas,Mojarra Frits! This place has the pork,chicken & beef grilled marinated and pulled and It tries to cover all bases and does a good job! Eddie the cook was friendly and funny and hopes the neighbors don't complain because he smokes the meat out back. BYOB! That's  right you can bring your own beer and if you forget you have Valley fair liquors next-door!"}
{"text":"Just an update.  After having been here a few times, I have to adjust my rating.  When they are good, they are really good. However, they can be hit or miss.  So sometimes you get a 3 and sometimes a 5.  I'll leave it at a 4, but without consistency, I can't give it a 5.  Still very good though!"}
{"text":"Popped in after getting stuck in rush hour traffic.  Turned out to be fantastic.  Had the chicken fajitas, and would recommend them.  Seems like a lot of pride in the food they are serving.  Will be back to try some of the other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Mexican people beware. This so called Mexican food place is horrible. The burritos are half full. The salsa is bland and the tamales were cold and flavorless. Paid $25 for a burrito and a tamale plate.  The young girl who served us was so sweet and we gave her a good tip. Avoid at all costs if looking for real Mexican food."}
{"text":"I was craving good tacos and yelp didn't steer me wrong. I got smoked pork, al pastor and carne asada tacos and they were all delicious. The prices are reasonable with good sized portions. I will definitely be back (maybe later today)."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite taco spot. I tried the grilled fish taco and the battered up fish taco and they were so yummy and juicy. The battered choice was my favorite though because the crust on the fish was on point. Just the right amount of salt and it was crunchy not soggy. The guy at the front was also very polite and was full of information. I will definitely be coming back here to try the other tacos but most likely probably won't be topping up that battered fish taco!"}
{"text":"Newer spot in Tempe serving great Mexican food. They are smoking their own meats in the back, are BYOB, and will start to sell meats by the pound here in the near future. The food is really good, the salsa bar let's you kick up the spices to your liking and the staff is friendly. Definitely give it a try if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"What a rip off. I ordered 2 fish tacos. I have never had a piece of fish soooo small. I think it was a  mino. The one star is for salsa. Thank God I asked for more. For their food prices being so high on the menu, they should be giving away free chips and bigger  containers of salsa. The restaurant is small and  charming, but the prices for the  street fast food you get  Is way too expensive.  I love Mexican, i have been to many hole in the Mexican joints and tacos stands, and this place doesn't come close to those. Their all about the money here, and not patrons enjoying meals they can go rave to others about how good the food is.  RIP OFF!!!. Beware!!!"}
{"text":"We love the food here. Wait staff is helpful and the food is healthy and delicious. Try the fish tacos and bean and cheese burrito with the many salsas freshly made and waiting to be tried at their salsa bar. We eat here once a week!"}
{"text":"Saw this place just driving by and decided to try it out. Best decision I could have made. Amazing food and not only did the servers take excellent care of us, but the cook himself came out and talked to us to. Great food and amazing staff. I'll be back for sure/"}
{"text":"My husband and I found this spot while visiting from out of town. We're from Southern California and appreciate good Mexican and good service. We were greeted by one of the owners who was very inviting and helpful. Everything was super fresh. Loved the salsa bar and chili rellenos!"}
{"text":"I really hope this place stays around for a long time.  I was hungry for dinner and i clicked on my Yelp app and this place had great reviews and had what i wanted, which at the moment was tacos!  The really unique thing about this place is that all the meats are cooked in a smoker which adds an added layer of flavor to your typical taco meat.   I asked for the 3 taco special which included rice and beans.  I had smoked chicken, smoked pork and smoked beef.  they were all pretty good!  The salsa bar is one of things you need to try. The salsa that stands out is an orange colored salsa that has some bite, and tastes like nothing I've had before.I'ts good, you need to get some. . The other salsas were also very good and I'll have to go back and try some different ones.   They have a good selection of meat, pretty much anything you want and many items on the menu that I have yet to check out,   Overall this is a great spot with people that care about the food they make. I'll be back for more"}
{"text":"Holy moly. Just had two grilled fish street tacos from here and they were delicious As a former East Coaster, I'm really picky about fish. This did not disappoint. It was super fresh and grilled perfectly. The toppings were rich but not overdone - there was a mildly spicy mayo,  cabbage, cilantro... I honestly ate it all so fast I can't say exactly what it entailed.   The atmosphere is basic, but they have nice tables and booths and everything seemed really clean. I'm really glad I found this spot on a random google search! I will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"I've picked up take-out here about a dozen times, and the food does not disappoint.  Especially their al pastor with hunks of griddled pineapple!  They've converted me to being a quesadilla lover  And their salsa bar . . . BEST I've ever come across.  Crisp and clean in a covered stainless steel mise en place cart . . . from hot to mild, various kinds in-between, with limes and sliced radish and green onion.  Stellar  I will say though . . . their concept is wonky.  You walk in, and there are purty tables set up for dine-in wait service, but, over the counter is a menu board?  Is it take out?  Is it sit down?  Confusing to say the least.  I'm going to say they'd be better served to just simply focus on being a order at the counter joint.  The wait service kinda scares me away, and I've only ordered takeout . . . but DAMN, the takeout  btw, it's BYOB, and there's a liquor store right next door.  The one time I did eat in, I was given a chilled glass to pour my beer in.  Bonus points"}
{"text":"Thankfully they put some signs on the street next to the strip mall, which kept teasing a spot in my subconscious directly linked to \"street taco nirvana\". This place was either going to hit the mark or be a \"one and done\". Well, it HIT the mark. The smoked and marinated meats are works of art. The fresh salsas are generally very good - the smoky salsa is the best choice. Everything is made to order, including the guacamole which we decided was necessary to tide us over until we could make decisions on the deep menu. The waitress reminded us it was made by hand upon order, so we would have to wait a bit for it. 2 minutes later it was at our table. OMG - delicious. We are now trying to figure out how to direct all our neighbors over here so it gets successfully launched. And we are going to see if they will let us order up a few pounds of meat for a party at our house. Oh wait, I missed one fine detail - BYOB!! Awesome place"}
{"text":"Delicious carne asada burrito. The employees were nice, generous with advice about what to order, and they let me try all the salsas which was fun - and the salsas are really good. Recommended!"}
{"text":"First time being here. Place is amazing. Good people, muy amable, running the business. The food is great and the environment is modern with traditional recipes.   For those that critique the price, this isn't a careta (taco cart) this place is a classy business with a culinary focus, for that, I am happy to pay the price that it is worth. Mexican food is a culinary art/tradition that often goes under-appreciated by those looking for cheap cheap."}
{"text":"Had a three taco plate, carnitas, adobado chicken, and carne asada. Also got the homemade chips and guac. Everything was so fresh and delicious and the owner was super friendly and clearly passionate about his food. I would say the adobado chicken was the best taco, they're the only taco shop in the valley that smokes their chicken and pork. Really gives a nice smokiness to the meat. Great salsa too. Definitely will be heading back here."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are always fresh, and AMAZING. Grilled or fired, chis are super fresh, and the Guacamole is outstanding!!!. When I treat myself for lunch it is rare! I would recommend you call in your order in advance! Good staff, Good Food. ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant.  Sampled quite a few items around our table and everything was delicious!  Loved the barbacoa burrito."}
{"text":"Really nice place fresh food great taste good value. Glad I saw the guy flipping the sign"}
{"text":"Ordered the fish street tacos today. Made to order fresh. Very tasty. A variety of salsas and toppings available.  I will be going back for more."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 taco meal all barbacoa.  The meat had good flavor and the medium salsa was perfect.  The reason for the 3 stars was this....Although the rice and beans are considered \"fillers\" - they should still taste great when it cost about $9.00 for the lunch plate.  I thought the beans were a bit too thick and the rice was about 2 more minutes from smelling spoiled :(   I also docked a star since I also had to wait about 20 minutes and they weren't busy at all. I hope these are just some growing pains.  I'll give it another try in a few months or so."}
{"text":"Wasnt expecting much coming from such a small spot in a strip mall...but was blown away with the food and atmosphere.  We ordered a quesadilla with smoked chicken and a small order of chips and guacamole.  The chips were hot and delicious (a bit salty) and the guac was excellent...both were good portions.  The quesadilla was made with authentic mexican cheese and the chicken was smoked in house.  Yummmm. I plan to go back soon.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Finally good Mexican food inTempe! The best meats I've had since I left Texas. They smoke all their own meats, it was amazing. We will defiantly be back often! Marinated chicken tacos and carnitas were divine  very attentive owners as well and wait for it.... It's BYOB and right next to a liquor store."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Customer service was excellent! The food, although inexpensive, were very tasty. We got the chicken burrito and they were very good. The hot sauces were also very good and fresh. I will be coming back and I recommend it!! Overall, extremely clean environment with a good dine in experience and yummy food."}
{"text":"I'm so happy that finally a good restaurant has moved into this space! Just had the Fajitas and they were excellent! This will definitely be a place I eat often."}
{"text":"Amazing Taco Tuesday! $1.50 tacos and they had calamity steak as a special this week that sold out before I got there (8pm) but I'd love to try it. The habanero sauce is super spicy, which I love, and the carne asada taco was amazing! Guacamole was also pretty fresh and it's BYOB with a liquor store next door!"}
{"text":"Walked in around 7:30pm on a Thursday and the place was completely empty. That's usually a bad sign.  There were 2 guys behind the counter and they both eagerly greeted us before the front door had finished closing. OK, getting better.  They asked if it was dine in or carry out. We said dine in and were offered the pick of any table.  One of the guys brought waters immediately after we sat down. And a few minutes after that the other guy came over to answer questions and take our orders.  We started with chips and guacamole. The chips were warm and crisp and a hint of lime; kind of like Chipotle's but not as bitter or overpowering. The guac was smooth and creamy. We liked both.  For tacos we tried the Al Pastor, barbacoa and carne asada. All were pretty good and uniquely spiced and flavored. My only complaint is the amount of lettuce piled on top. We had to scrape a good portion of it off. The tacos are good and don't need to be buried under a mountain of filler.  We also sampled several salsas from the salsa and found them to be most excellent. Salsa bar is on point.  We were pleasantly surprised at the food and service we received at TC TACO. I really hope this place makes it because it deserves to."}
{"text":"Checked this place out with a friend. He had a burrito and a couple of tacos, while I just had tacos.  His burrito was fairly small. Looked like it needed more filling to tortilla ratio. The tacos were good. Their homemade chorizo was tasty, and I'd definitely recommend the al pastor. I also had barbacoa and smoked pork. Nothing really special about either.   I always love a good salsa bar but instead of having containers handy for the customer to grab they would just hand you a couple. I love to be able to try all the salsas a place makes but don't want to have to deal with them being stingy with the containers...  Would I eat here again? Sure, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."}
{"text":"Oh my where do I begin? The workers are so friendly and sociable which is so rare nowadays. My boyfriend and I came here for the first time a couple days ago and ordered a burrito and street tacos. May I just say the food was exquisite and so reasonably priced!!!! Unlike most Mexican food places, TC tacos makes their food in a way that doesn't leave a heavy, greased out feeling. They also have a huge variety of freshly made salsa. I will definitely be frequenting this diamond of a taco shop!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos!  The veggie burrito is also delish!   If you are in the neighborhood check it out."}
{"text":"Always a delight coming into TC's. I know im going to get great service and great food. Highly reccomended."}
{"text":"Great place.   Their tacos are always good. The chips and salsa/guac are good too.   It's a really cute place. I eat there at least a couple times a week. :)"}
{"text":"You must try the Al Pastor taco! Their salsa selection is wonderful and you'll really feel the burn, have some homemade horchata to cool down. The staff was friendly, everything seemed clean."}
{"text":"I had the Menudo. I am big on Menudo .my Favorite. The Menudo is Good Too much Hominy over cooked is was in small pieces.very red but decent.service amazing BYOB even better.ill be back but probably not for Menudo again."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite taco spot in the valley.  The food is great, staff is friendly, prices are more than fair, and I love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just finished eating here with the family and was very impressed!! Awesome customer service that went above and beyond! Clean, very good and flavorful food! I would give them a 6 star if I could. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing tacos!!! The staff is super friendly! They treat you like family and are genuinely happy to share their amazing food and service with you !! I absolutely love this place !! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Fantastic street tacos! Little gem in Tempe. I had the Carne asada, Al Pastor pork, smoked chicken and pork tacos."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious. Excellent salsa bar and they're alway super nice and attentive.  I love the carne asada."}
{"text":"Super casual chill place and the food is awesome! All the workers and owner are super personable and friendly. Also, you can stop next door and grab some beer before you sit down and eat! Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"I come here a couple times a week, always great. Very friendly family running the place. Get the smoked chicken!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Here again tonight.  Great service, wonderful food and grabbing a beer from next door.  Have done take out and eaten in.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! It's BYOB and the same owner owns the liquor store next to it, can you say convenient. They are super nice and cater to your needs. I asked for a special order and they didn't hesitate to help me out.  I will definitely be back and recommend getting to this place ASAP. #happycustomer"}
{"text":"My moms obsessed w this place and eats it all the time. today I tried their steak fajitas. It came w red and yellow sliced bell pepper, white onion, Spanish rice and pinto beans(melted white cheese on top) on the side. It was very good along w their guacamole. Only thing I didn't really like was their dark green salsa. It was a darker hotter salsa I've never tasted before. Idk if it spilled but it seems like that's what they put on the steak and it was just a little much. Next time I'll ask for it w/o."}
{"text":"Had the steak, chicken and barbacoa tacos. Delicious and fresh. Not heavy and greasy. I could have had another 1-2 tacos. Would come back again."}
{"text":"Haven't had TC Tacos in a while. We love them but would be nice if they worked with DoorDash or UberEats. Not sure why they don't"}
{"text":"This place has amazing tacos!! They're probably the best in Tempe. They have a dinner special for about ten bucks where you get 3 tacos, rice, and beans. That's what I would recommend. It's also a BYOB.  There's a liquor store next door, so you know what to do."}
{"text":"Based on the yelp reviews, we decided to check this place out and weren't disappointed. I had three street tacos, two barbacoa and one al pastor. I preferred the barbacoa, but both were flavorful. Also, I asked for extra cilantro and onion, and they readily agreed. No problems.  My guy had a Carne asada breakfast burrito which he said was good but a little on the dry side.  We loved the BYOB feature and picked up a couple drinks at the liquor store next door. Overall, if I'm on that side of town, I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had in AZ or anywhere else. Don't be fooled by the high overall rating - I read in another recent review this place has new owners and things have gone downhill. My experience today was terrible. Carne asada meat was chewy and obviously low quality plus it was super sparse in the items I ordered (burrito and large quesadilla). I paid extra for onions and jalapeños in the quesadilla and it was still flavorless, I can't imagine how lame it would have been if I hadn't added these items. I added a photo of the worst item, the carnitas taco - four big chunks of fat and three tiny pieces of meat with hardly any garnish. Total waste of $23. Do yourself a favor and stay far, far away."}
{"text":"It's a little on the pricey side for small tacos, but none the less, the smoked chicken tacos are A+. But the burritos are very small for the price, more so the size of those skinny gas stations burritos. Either way, I can't help but keep coming back!"}
{"text":"The food can be good.  But very much like the service can be very hit or miss.  Came in today and only ordered a bowl of menudo and a side of beans.  I  was THE only customer in the place and it took over 25 minutes to get my soup.  The beans didn't make it to the table.  No explanation,  apology, or anything.  By the time the bowl got to the table it may have had about 1/2 cup of menudo in it for $7.99 (note the size of the spoon next to the little bowl in my photo).   I  have been here for menudo in the past and the bowl was 2 or 3 times bigger.  The kid behind the counter said \"well maybe I could reduce the price for you\".  All I wanted was enough soup for a meal.  I could see the 2 cooks in the back just having a great time conversing without a care in the world.  The kid behind the counter seemed to be most interested in finding something on the TV that he was interested in watching.  Needless to say, I just walked out."}
{"text":"Visiting from the Seattle area and couldn't wait to try some authentic Mexican food. Out of all the fine dining in Seattle one of my favorite places is a taco truck . This place was awesome. The reviews I read talked about the smoke meat which was very accurate. Add the roasted jalapeños and all the sides in my burrito this place was exactly what I was hoping for. I'll be back to try the breakfast burritos. Nice job"}
{"text":"This is my first review. I have used yelp for a couple of years to find good food but never have taken the time to leave a review. The tacos are so yummy! Beans and rice were good but those are just filler!  My friend, who travels to Mexico on a regular basis, said the tacos tasted very authentic. I got the 3 taco plate (Bistec, Al Pastor, and Barbacoa). My favorite was the Al Pastor but all 3 were tender and delicious. I was sad to see that it wasn't busy at lunch. This place is worth trying! I give 4 stars instead of 5 because the sign says that the chips are made fresh to order but when they arrived, they were not hot or even warm. I could tell they were homemade but not \"fresh to order\". My only other critique is location. Tucked back in a strip mall, it is difficult to find."}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch or a breakfast burrito! Good food, clean shop, great customer service. And the horchata is pretty good too ;)"}
{"text":"Average food. Not as inexpensive as I would have thought. Ended up spending more than anticipated. Would not return."}
{"text":"The barabacoa pork burrito is so good ! And so is the guac! The staff is so nice !!! It was great, me and my boyfriend absolutely love it and come in once a week !! You should deft give them a try if you are in Tempe"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I are always looking for new places to try for lunch but this taco shop has earned a permanent spot in our rotation. We come here at least twice a month, everything I've had is delicious but my favorite has got to be the smoked chicken. The salsa bar is also very good! I like that they keep it chilled in a covered cooler but you might miss it if you aren't looking for it. All of the salsa tastes very fresh."}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC!!!! I'm from California and my son will be attending ASU. This is going to be our go to spot when we visit him. The food is freshly made, flavorful and very appealing. I was able to get a free drink with a coupon on Yelp. If your visiting Tempe or out of the area make sure you stop at TC Tacos!!"}
{"text":"Fun ambience, really nice server. TC smokes all their meats on site and it shows in the food. The Al Pastor tacos were very legit and flavorful. You get A LOT of food for under $10. A nice quiet location that is perfect for a slow-paced lunch. Not far from ASU at all."}
{"text":"This taco place has the best food ever. No gristle in the meat like usual. Super fresh and really lean I love the Barbacoa and the chicken is to die for! P.s great variety of sauces and the owner is totally cool and it's BYOB!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for dinner tonight, after a really long day of tubing. We were starving as we entered the place, and I ordered three tacos, the carne asada, the barbacoa and the al pastor. Food was served promptly without much delay, and was delicious! The tacos are small, so depending on how hungry you are, you might need a few to fill you up, but they all tasted great. The service could improve though, water refills and second time orders took quite a while, mainly because there was one person who was the cashier/server on a decently busy Saturday night. Great place for tacos!"}
{"text":"Food was good, I had the Carne asada burrito. It was very tasty and I loved the salsa bar. The service was great by two young girls. Very sweet. Not much people in restaurant but quite a few take out orders while we were there. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Definitely worth stopping in.  Excellent flavor on all the tacos.  I also had the guac and chips which was tasty.  I'll be back when I'm in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I'm on a business trip and I want to eat some good, fairly priced food. I head to Yelp to see what everyone has to say and read through reviews and pictures. I drive the 15 mins to TC Tacos, and I am so glad I did.  The joint looks a little sketchy at first, and the crowd is varied, (I decided to get it to-go, and eat at my hotel) but that's where the negative-ish comments end.  The employees are so friendly. They greeted me the second I walked in. I told them I'd never been and asked what I should order. They proceeded to ask some questions about my taste preferences and where I was from.  I ended up ordering the 3 taco meal---Carne Asada, Smoked pork and smoked chicken. Ri-God-damn-diculous.  I loved the special green salsa, the horchata (a little on the sweet side, let the ice melt or add rum!).  The rice and beans were amazing too.   Great Experience.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome! Stopped in here yesterday for a quick snack since I was having a bad guacamole craving after a movie. Not just any guac would do - I needed something fresh and chunky, not that smooth runny stuff you find at any 'bertos. I got exactly what I was looking for. If I could change one small thing about it, it would only be to have more of it for the price.  Since we were at a taco place, we each ordered one taco with the intention of giving each other a lil' sample bite. I got the chorizo and he got the al pastor. Both were incredible! Bear in mind that these are small street-style tacos, so if you are really hungry, order a few. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place has declined with its service and food quality. Tacos where lightly served with meat, pico really was bland, no seasonings. Waitress seamed like she didn't know what she was doing. And for the price very unreasonable. Also rice took thirty minutes to bring. Overall wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend unless you like eating taco bell this would be good to you but we are mad ethnic personally and with all honesty this some walmart tacos if there where walmart tacos."}
{"text":"Cute place, very clean. The menu is easy to read that's above the counter, but the menus I'm the table weren't as easy.  I got an El Pastor and fish street taco. Nicely presented, but the El Pastor too spicy for me and I didn't care for the smoky flavor of the sauce. I barely had any pineapple and the ones that were there were so small I couldn't taste them. The meat was more like a pulled pork, it was moist and had a good flavor. I wouldn't prefer it again as I don't like good that spicy. The fish was crispy and had good flavor, but again, too spicy for me. Overall was good, but was a bit expensive. Probably wouldn't come back. We didn't get refills on our waters until we were pretty much done with lunch. Disappointing service."}
{"text":"Made a visit here today for lunch. Food was ready in record time. Got the chicken tacos with rice and beans. No complaints here. Fresh food, good service, no wait. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I love a good taco. And horchata. And salsa. And this place has all three.   We drove out here since I had to make some returns in Tempe, and I dragged my sister along promising tacos. This restaurant is a small, sit-down place with a cozy feel and cute decor. Workers are very nice and accommodating. We started off by ordering an horchata and chips and salsa, and both were fabulous which is how we knew we found a good food joint. Horchata is a little sweet but lacks nothing in flavor, as it also has a very nice creamy consistency. The salsa is my favorite though with a slight smoky undertone from the chiles used and medium heat level. They also have a salsa bar with the works back by the counter, and all of them were good, honestly.  Taco meat is usually smoked according to the menu, and my sister and I sampled almost all of them with the grilled fish and chicken being the favorite. I even added a grilled jalapeno to mine for an extra kick.   Prices are very reasonable, and even though the tacos seem smaller, we left ready to explode after everything. This is definitely a place I wish was closer to my house but if you're in the area, hit 'em up for some awesome tacos!"}
{"text":"Customer Service was great, food was good, they want out of their way. Specifically Eric and Jerry."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Yum.   I am a taco fanatic, have lived in Tempe for several years, and this place rocks. SO happy this opened here! Conveniently located close to my house, I decided to pop over one day to check it out.  They have a meat smoker in house, and smoke their own meats, which were de-lish. I had the smoked pork street tacos, which although look small, are insanely filling and good. They also have a homemade salsa bar which was a great selection of flavors and levels of spice. Will most definitely be back, best authentic Mexican restaurant in Tempe, hands down."}
{"text":"This place was on our way home from a road trip to Tuscon, and they had a super easy online ordering system from Eat24, so we have it a shot.  We though their carne asada was pretty good. their hot salsa was also very good.  The al pastor on the other hand. had a grilled pineapple thing that was not for me.  They have extremely reasonable prices.   My advice, if you're going to eat here do the shrimp tacos. because they were $2.75 and GANGSTER."}
{"text":"Staff: Friendly and quirky. You can tell they care a lot about the food and check in several times to make sure everything is up to par. Might be overbearing for some food enjoyers. They are a few months in and are working to develop their brand.   Food: Salsas are homemade and you get various options a la carte and free. Spanish Rice was flavorful but a tad too fluffy and overcooked. I don't think the rice was extra long grain which is what I believe most Mexican dishes use . Meat options were plentiful and tasty. I'd say their meat is the strongest item in terms of flavor on the menu.    Drinks: They do have horchata but it's in a big glass server and not machine so it's not getting consistently stirred and the alcohol is literally BYOB (there's a liquor store right next door). Kinda fun and they have ice buckets and frozen glasses for you.  I would definitely come back in. This is the type of restaurant that seems to go the extra mile to get to know you and find out how they can continue developing their food!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken taco salad and it was delicious, and at a great price! The owner even came by and genuinely wanted feedback on the quality of the food. To me that is one of the most important things for a business owner to know. The only thing I suggest is some music, so that's its not so quiet."}
{"text":"This was great.  The tacos were great and I plan on moving through the menu trying everything.  Loved the salsas and mole sauces too."}
{"text":"Super nice and clean inside! Not to mention the food is PHENOMENAL!! Made super fresh and authentic! The meats they have are so flavorful! My new favorite spot!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was so so good! I had the taco dinner which was 3 tacos with rice and beans. We needed a place like this in Tempe. Mexican food has been so disappointed but TC's delivered! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Really amazing stuff, I'd been craving an authentic street taco and decided to try this place out after being disappointed with the quality of several other local taco shops I've tried and this place is LEGIT! Authentic, house-smoked meats, fresh salsa bar and very friendly service. I'm definitely gonna be going there again and again after this experience. I tried 2 of each type of meat for their street tacos and each one was unique, high-quality, and DELICIOUS. My two favorites were the smoked chicken and the carne asada, however the carnitas and barbacoa were amazing as well. Depending on what I'm in the mood for I can imagine ordering any one of them again. If you want the authentic real deal you've got to check this place out! :D"}
{"text":"Great expectations based on yelp reviews, but I was disappointed. Sunday night with two servers and not a lot of customers. Friendly server promptly took our order, but it took a long time for our order to come. The beans were cold and had to be returned and heated up. Took a long time to get them back. Turns out my frijoles lacked flavor - - maybe not enough salt. My pork burrito also lacked much spice. I asked for red medium salsa and got mild. I returned it and was given medium GREEN salsa. I just let it go. I took half the burrito home (large enough portion), and I'm going to have to load it up with my own salsa. Maybe we got the second string weekend crew. I may go back and give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite new place for tacos. I had driven by this place a few times before I decided to try it for quick dinner take out. We got smoked chicken, barbacoa and al pastor, and all were fantastic. The chicken was tender the barbacoa flavorful and the al pastor surprisingly spicy. Great guac and chips along side, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I walked around the whole parking lot looking for it because once I got inside I had to tell them to turn on their outside light, no trash bins for the customers. I ordered the three taco meal not the cheapest and comes with three small three bite tacos and a small portion of rice and beans.. Not impressed with how it was reviewed."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, we have often entered restaurants near to closing time and have always been \"warned\" by the staff that closing time was approaching and have even been turned away on a few occasions. That was absolutely NOT the case at TC Tacos. We arrived at 8:30 on a Sunday night. We were welcomed to \"dine-in\" without hesitation even though they were scheduled to close at 9pm. The owner greeted us and made us feel comfortable to take our time ordering and eating. To me this was even more important than the food. The exceptional food was just a bonus at this point. Not surprising though. It was very clear that the owner took a lot of pride in his food and his goal is his customers enjoying their food and experience in his restaurant. Our group of five had a variety of burritos and tacos and we all left with very happy bellies!  We will definitely be regular customers whenever we're in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Mexican place. I had the chicken burrito and a shrimp taco. My husband had the carne asada quesadilla. All were very authentic and seemed to be the right amount of everything in them. Not too oily or greasy as a lot of other Mexican places are. The shrimp taco had a tasty cabbage/pico/ sauce blend which was perfect!  I don't leave a lot of reviews but if you are looking for some good Mexican takeout this place is so great!"}
{"text":"This place has definitely improved from that last time I was here (grand opening). They must have taken notes from the critical reviews because it is evident to me that this place has done well for itself and developed into a decently authentic taco shop. They seemed to have enhanced the salsa bar, because those salsas are fresh and delicious and the bar even includes fresh radishes, limes and hot pickle. The fish and shrimp tacos are a must try. Menu changed slightly, but for the better. You can't go wrong with any of their meats. Wonderful guacamole too. I'm glad I have this a second chance. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Brief editorial of when I went to eat here. I first ordered a taco salad an that was very low on meat with hardly any sour cream and hardly any guacamole either. I said something to the young lady who worked there that day and nothing was done. Anyways I went back there to give a second chance an ordered something else to see if it was just a first time mistake which we all know happens. So I ordered fish tacos and a burrito on a lunch visit to go. Well being in a hurry got me a dry taco with nothing on it an then overcharged on my receipt as well. I called back an the girl somehow knew what I was talking about automatically an said to stop back by to grab what she had overcharged me. About $3 overcharged an I only ordered $10 worth of stuff. So if I hadn't noticed they would've made off with some extra dough. Overall if you can go elsewhere do so but if you choose to be careful of what's being ordered an what's being charged. Take care an I hope this helps also."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome!! Better than any Mexican food place in Tempe!! Go here and get the burrito dinner"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss. Food remains good even though ownership and kitchen staff changed. Fish, chicken, and carne asada tacos all yummy!"}
{"text":"Don't let the ratings fool you, this place changed for the worse and isn't worth your time. I wouldn't come back even if I didn't know what it once was.  I used to be a huge fan. We once did five taco Tuesday's in a row here because it was so fun with great food. The BYOB thing is awesome but nothing can excuse how the quality of the food, high prices, and poor service have become normal.  As a taco place, there should be more than one server working on a Tuesday at dinner time. The meat quality once was excellent. Now it is mediocre at best. I don't ever want to pay more than $2 for such sub par tacos again. We paid $2.75 for two shrimps on a taco.  While we were waiting for the food, someone tried to call in an order but the next thing I heard was the dial tone about 15 minutes after they'd been \"put on hold\" (never having ordered) so I guess don't order to go either.  Their final offense was my telling the server that I don't like spicy anything and asked whether the meats I was ordering were spicy. She said she didn't think they were and then said she didn't really know.  To add insult to injury, the server was loudly chewing gum while she took orders, dropped off food/drinks, and brought the check. GROSS."}
{"text":"good food, good price, and very authentic.  Mall is old but clean and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Sad Day. Apparently there's a new owner. We knew something was different (not in a good way). We both had our favorite fish burrito, it was more of a pico and cabbage burrito! These things used to be loaded with fish and now I was happy to get a tidbit. The service was still wonderful, but unfortunately we will not be returning unless the new owner has an epiphany and serving quality food that meet our expectations."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch today and had the three taco dinner--smoked chicken, smoked pork and fried fish. The salsa bar is very complete with mild to spicy along with smokey flavors and were just a perfect match for customizing the tacos.  The tacos taste just like the ones on the street or from a small taco stand in Mexico.  They were delicious.  The two guys working there were wonderful and service was great.  It's a small hole-in-the-wall place, but I will definitely be back.  I'm so glad to have a great taco place so near to where I live.  I can definitely drop in there more often."}
{"text":"Delishious.  Everything was great. Server was awesome. My favorite was the tacos . I got one of each . Guac and salsa was refreshing"}
{"text":"Had a craving for street tacos and saw the amazing reviews on this place so we had to Come check it out! Amazing service to start off with. We ordered about 5 different tacos and the taco salad. Everything was great! The owner even helped us decide what sauces to add with each taco! Will definitely be coming again :)"}
{"text":"I was craving tacos and found this little shop online. The Taco Tuesday special was shredded pork with guajillo and cabbage slaw. One of the best tacos I've ever eaten! For $1.50, they are giving tacos away! I can't wait to try more. This will be my stop every Tuesday from now on."}
{"text":"Good carne asada tacos! The beans and rice was not great beans were cold and just not good, but the tacos were excellent and the salsa was good and hot!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! Great food both times I've gone. I particularly enjoyed the al pastor street tacos. It was also fun that they made recommendations at the salsa bar based on what went best with your meal."}
{"text":"We were traveling from Flagstaff to Tucson and stopped by TC Tacos for a halfway dinner stop.  It will now be a common stop when we are in Tempe.  Great service, positive feel, a delightful salsa bar, in-and-out, and the street tacos......mmmmm, fabulous, tasty, and super fresh.  A lot of pride has been put into this great little local restaurant.  See ya next time, TC Tacos!"}
{"text":"TC tacos turned out to be a pretty good meal.  We were a little confused when we walked in because you can't really figure out if it's a order at the counter,  or a seat yourself type deal.  Turns out both were right.  Service was very friendly and quick. We ordered chips and salsa and while the chips were hot and incredibly fresh,  the salsa lacked any heat. Side bar, I had no idea there was a salsa bar, wish I had! The street tacos were pretty good but only the Barbacoa really impressed me.  My husband's burrito was really good,  but could have used some of the salsa bar action that we didn't know about.    Overall we enjoyed our meals and didn't break the bank.  I think it's awesome this place is BYOB and I'll make sure to come prepared next time."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast service, and good food. We got 5 different types of tacos. Shrimp was the best! I got a veggie burrito and it was really good and super filling. I'll definitely go back"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally did tonight.  Great location, lots of parking despite being prime time for LA Fitness in the same parking lot.  Staff was super friendly and helpful when choosing our food.  My son ordered the barbacoa beef burrito, I ordered the in-house smoked chicken burrito, and we swapped burrito halves.    My favorite was the barbacoa, so tender and not stringy at all, full of flavor with just a hint of sweet.  The burrito had just the right amounts of fluffy seasoned rice, crunchy onions, fresh cilantro, cubes of tomato, creamy melty cheese, all wrapped up in a soft yet flaky tortilla.  It was gone before I knew what hit me.  Chicken burrito was delicious also but a little milder in flavor than the barbacoa.  Moist chicken had a yummy grilled flavor that mixed beautifully with the other ingredients so each bite held *all* the flavors.  Outstanding flavors, really hit the spot for both of us.  Can't wait to go back and start working our way through the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time yesterday and had their taco dinner (3 tacos for $8.99 with a side of rice (and beans if you want)). I had one carne asada taco, shrimp taco, and fish taco. I really liked the shrimp and carne asada.  Not so much the fish..that was ok. Their sauces are soooooo spicy I couldn't hang! Overall I had a really good experience especially with the really nice customer service. Definitely will come here again!"}
{"text":"Great chef, family run place. Excellent street tacos!  Clean super friendly atmosphere with lots of people coming in to take home their 20 taco feast lol. Had the grilled fish taco was delish!! Corn tortillas were fresh and soft maybe they hand make them, not sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious fish tacos and the guacamole and fresh chips are equally good.  The only reason I gave four instead of five stars is because we were the only people in the restaurant at 8:30 on mothers day evening.  Very friendly staff. Feels like eating at a friends house--that is a friend who makes very good and authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"These are some of the best tacos I've had here in the Phoenix area. Wasn't sure which tacos to try first, so I ordered 3 different ones. My favorites were the carme asada and the al pastor. The smoked chicken was good too. Lots of flavor in those three tacos that I tried. Good salsa bar too. I will definitely be coming back here again in the future."}
{"text":"The food and service were great.  I ordered the 3. Street taco combo 2 barbacoa and 1 chicken, outstanding! Fresh fast and tasty.   Love TC!"}
{"text":"We had TC tacos cater our baby shower and only tried it once before. That was also after I had already arranged to have them cater our food. I am glad I went with this place on a whim because they make some damn good tacos. I just went there again the other day for lunch and again not disappointed. I had two fish tacos, carne asada, and I can't recall what else currently. Doesn't matter because they have great food and great salsa so just try it already."}
{"text":"When I'm at tc tacos all I get is wild thoughts. Wild wild wild. Good food great service. Hostess is laid back and chill. Good vibes all around. Will return for another day."}
{"text":"Stopped by again, this time for beef, smoked chicken and fish tacos. Excellent. This place is consistently terrific."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick bite - in town for work.  Great street tacos!  And enjoyed the veggie burrito, but not as much as the carne asada street taco.  Salsa bar was great too.  Inexpensive, quick, friendly, and tasty!"}
{"text":"We started with fresh chips that were hot to the table and ordered guacamole that was flavorful and creamy.  I posted a pic.   I ordered a 3 tacos, chicken, Carne and grilled shrimp and all three were amazing, I don't know which one I liked best. Beans and rice came with,  also excellent. I love that they have real Mexican coke (as well as a huge variety of other Mexican sodas).   My boyfriend got a Chile relleno, and he just kept shaking his head YES, he says it's very good.   Decor is nice,  bright colors and clean.  Staff is friendly and made great recommendations.    I'm sure we will be back many times.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile because I am always looking for the best tacos in town. However, I decided to try a taco salad and it was awesome! As soon as you walk in you can smell the smokiness. I was already excited. I loved the al pastor! Most places that sell it with the pineapple automatically win. Seeing that they are BYOB friendly makes me want to come back sooner and really indulge."}
{"text":"In the PHX metro area, Mexican food joints are a dime a dozen. Innumerable \"erto\" (not to be confused with the \"itos\" out there which tend to actually be very good) monikered burrito joints dot the sparse landscape from Wickenburg to Apache Junction.  What sets TC Tacos apart from the rest is the quality and care they put into their food. It's a tier above the rest. Their barbacoa is delightful. The Minerva sauce is, frankly, bomb."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp looking for a cheap taco joint near ASU. I was quite disappointed with the food I received. I ordered three carne aside tacos with rice and beans. The rice and beans were tasty but my tacos were nothing special at all. They weren't even served with cilantro or onion(a taco necessity), instead it was sprinkled with some old brown lettuce and diced tomatoes. Also each taco came to be three dollars which is pretty expensive for the type and quality of the little tacos. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Hands down. One of the best places to get street style tacos and the salsa bar is so diverse that it's almost hard to pick one. But the number one thing that sticks out the most about TC's is the hospitality. Down to the people working the counter, to the chef who will always find a moment to come around to the front to ask you how the dishes are tasting. It's a place to get amazing food, but most importantly amazing service and hospitality. Thank you TC's for being true. Don't change babe."}
{"text":"I found TC Taco on Yelp after craving tacos and burritos all day. My boyfriend and I ordered two smoked chicken tacos, two barbacoa tacos and one smoked chicken burrito. The food came fast and was phenomenal. No longer will I go to Chipotle, Qdoba or Dos Gringos.  The owner and his wife are fabulous and it's BYOB!!!! There is a liquor store next door so you can buy a drink and then walk a few feet and enjoy some great food.  P.S. they give 10% discount for ASU students and veterans at both the taco shop and liquor store!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a taco salad.. NEW FAVORITE PLACE. Carne asada meat tasted smoked and Mexican cheese made the best lunch I've had in a while.  Aka cartr, so pricey, taco salad with Carne was 9. Chips and salsa 3.50, and they charged me 2.00 for less than 2 ounces of \"extra cheese\".. that could be better."}
{"text":"Liked the salsa bar a lot and thought the tacos were good.  Got them meatless, there was plenty of flavor, tasted great"}
{"text":"I had TC Tacos bookmarked on my Google Maps, and on a recent visit to Arizona I decided to give them a try. Imagine my surprise when I pulled into the parking lot and remember the spot... I had been there before! I was excited, because I had a vague recollection of me enjoying their food. Well I grabbed a couple $2 street tacos and once again enjoyed them. I wouldn't say this place is a hole in the wall, it's got a few tables and is more a sit down restaurant than a take away place, but the prices do not reflect the extra service. It's cheap! So many meat choices for your tacos, too, and a really nice salsa bar. If I lived in the area, I'd probably be popping by here a lot."}
{"text":"What a delightful restaurant! I stopped in after a workout and was pleasantly surprised by the food, reasonable pricing, and hospitality.  What I took to be the owner started off my meal with a free (and delicious!) empanada. He said it was his way of thanking his patrons after being closed for 3 days because of a power outage. What a welcome gesture!   The waitress was helpful in warning me that the al pastor burrito I ordered would be spicy (it had just enough kick without being overpowering, for my taste). It was a very good size for only $6.50!  The restaurant also has a well-stocked and clean salsa bar. The barbacoa and cilantro flavors I tried were both very good."}
{"text":"We got tacos and the taco salad. All of it was extremely good! The taste was all there, you can tell they smoke all the meat in house which makes it even better. Also everyone was super nice. Clean restaurant and nice set up. Overall very good experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Service was spectacular, food was authentic and delectable. Went in for my first time ever on my birthday today, they brought me and my friend free desert! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Mexican restaurant in this area! Clean, very reasonable, kind, and super delicious. I love their salsa bar. I always get a chicken taco salad or shrimp burrito."}
{"text":"The people here are so welcoming! Simple street tacos and a salsa bar with good homemade food. Tempe has been needing some street taco action and this is a perfect location. Can't wait to try a burrito!"}
{"text":"BEST barbacoa I've ever had, hands down. Friendly service, great salsa bar. Will be eating here daily until they get sick of seeing me. This place is incredible!"}
{"text":"Great little place! Yummy street tacos, great selection of salsas, and the chips came out hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Update to review:  I'm not sure if the ownership has changed but the original charm has been completely lost. There is an overwhelming feel of penny-pinching and cheapness. They monitor use of the salsa bar which is one of the element of this restaurant I used to like.   Adding to the disappointment, the food was horrible. My smoked chicken tasted like they scrapped it off the bottom of the grill.   The customer service also needs to be improved. It's a real shame, I use to really enjoy this place....  ------------  Walking into TC Tacos I was immediately excited by the discovery of what all Yelpers hold dear, the \"whole-in-the-wall\". On arrival, I was greeted by Eddie, who was very welcoming and suggested that we explore their chicken tacos.   Receiving the food, I would say I was satisfied but not ecstatic. With that said, they have a modest yet delicious salsa bar."}
{"text":"This place was a total disappointment. The meat,the little that you could find in the Tacos did have a very nice flavor. But it was all cold, the tortillas were cold and dry. The carne asada burro was mostly beans and rice, couldn't even taste the meat. Their portions of rice and beans was also very small in the dinner plate that we bought. Overall  You're better off at one of the Bertos taco shops. Highly over priced. The place was very clean though but we took our food to go, 4 minutes to our house. Will stick to polibertos or tortilla fish if I want tacos.."}
{"text":"This placed used to be a Taiwanese restaurant, Henry's. Didn't realIze it was replaced by a Mexican restaurant. Came in, and was greeted right away. I saw the yelp offer and checked in to get my free horchata. The horchata was pretty sweet for my taste buds, so my friend and I couldn't finish it. We ordered the taco dinner plate, with two carne asada and 1 pastor taco. I liked how the pastor had small pieces of pineapple. Yum. For the price of the plate, there was not that much meat in my tacos. The Carne asada marinade was good, but the meat was ok. In summary, I probably wouldn't come here again, but it wasn't terrible. The customer service was great, and they had three different salsas to choose from. Mild, medium or spicy. Medium salsa was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place and their shrimp tacos, always great service and their byob is awesome"}
{"text":"YHE BEST fish taco I have had in my life.  I got the fried fish taco.  It came with mayo on it and I hate mayo, but the fish was so good I had to eat it anyhow!  They smoke their own meats and my fiancé and roommate got their smoked chicken and al pastor tacos for the taco Tuesday special.  They said both were delicious.  I tried the al pastor and found it yummy as well.  I also tried the chorizo taco, but it wasn't anything special.  The guy who served us (I think he is the owner) was super friendly, helpful, and attentive.  This place has BYOB and there is a drive through (kinda sketchy) liquor store next door.  The taco Tuesday special was for 3 street tacos, and it only ran my fiancé just over $4.00!  The chips are made to order and my fiancé who isn't a big chip person couldn't stop eating them!  I can't wait to go back and try the carne asada and fried shrimp tacos that many others have praised in their reviews!  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Just what we were looking for!  We wanted some authentic Mexican food that isn't available in Vegas, and we loved this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Ate here on Sunday 1/22/2017. Some of the best Chorizo I have had. Not to mention they have Mexican Coke. After spending 6weeks in Mexico, that's the one I missed the most."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Breakfast burrito is super yummy! Try it with Carne asada!! The owner is super friendly! Good people and a great place!! Addicted!"}
{"text":"Great beef and smoked chicken tacos.  Original order did not come out correctly but they quickly fixed it."}
{"text":"Tried smoked chicken and barbacoa beef street tacos. The barbacoa was awesome! Very flavorful! Will try burrito next!"}
{"text":"I don't particularly LOVE Mexican food (East Coaster) and I don't often choose Mexican over other kinds of foods. But this place is awesome! Got a smoked pork burrito and it was soooo good! Smoked in house and the crispy ends were included, best part! Will mostly definitely be visiting this little spot again."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. The first time I ordered a carne asada quesadilla & it was amazing.   Today I had the taco salad bowl with carne asada. It was perfect. No complaints, great service, & such a convenient place"}
{"text":"1st time going we had tacos, and tried a bunch of different meats, the standout of them all is the smoked chicken.  WOW!  this is next level stuff.  not your standard low grade chicken cooked on a flat top like your typical late night joints.  this is packed with that smokey flavor.  I smoke all kinds of stuff at home and they save me the work.  Great spot for lunch on my day off.  I'll get the smoken chicken in a burrito and it is fantastic.  I need to sample some other options but then I don't get my chicken fix.  The chicken reminds me of BackYard Taco in Mesa.  Much closer for me, and that great smoked flavor hits the spot."}
{"text":"So glad I tried this taco shop in an unassuming strip mall. It doesn't look like much from the outside but inside it's warm and comfortable. The food is fresh and delicious. The guacamole and salsa tasted like they were just made and the street tacos were fantastic. My picky son devoured his food as well. We will be regulars at Tempe City Tacos."}
{"text":"Good choice, the food is great and the service is awesome. Clean place and prices are correct."}
{"text":"Great Service, Awesome Smoked Pork Tacos, great flavor on the Carne Asada (a little tough). Had the chips and salsa, awesome salsa flavor."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! I've tried several different items on the menu and have not been disappointed. My favorite is the taco salad with barbacoa. The owners and servers are very kind and personable. They remember who you are (at least us).  This place is a nice medium size restaurant with several booths. They have a great selection of sauces in the sauce bar and a great selection of Jarritos. The horchata is one of the best I have tasted. Great authentic Mexican food. We love taking our friends there."}
{"text":"Husband and I were in Tempe and hungry. Yelped and this little gem popped up. I had the chile relleno burrito. OMG! The cheese was melted and running all over the plate, and flavorful!  I KNOW my chile rellenos and this was a good one, slightly charred the way I like it. The husband had the 3 taco plate, chicken adobo, chorizo & barbecued chicken. He said they were all good. I tasted only the barbecued chicken taco and had to agree with him.   Their salsa bar is awesome, and they keep it on ice so it stays really fresh. I also had a sampling of their smoked chicken and it was really good tasting. Apparently they make smoked chicken tacos.  Will definitely go back when next I'm in town."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we'll definitely be back! Great variety of salsas and the one we had with chips was my favorite, it's as if they roasted the chilies, nice smokey flavor. I ordered the chile rellenos, which is always my marker for good Mexican food, wasn't disappointed! Almost as good as my mom's! Service was great too, the owner was there and super friendly, great conversation all around! My boyfriend had al pastor and carne asada tacos, both had great flavor. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Was in the area meeting an out if town friend and he wanted Mexican. So used the Yelp and found this place close by. It is small and curious from the outside. The staff is friendly and the menu is simple to understand and order from, probably one if the most well-thought out menus, pick your protein and then pick your style.  The people I was with ordered the 3 Tacos (each got a beef, pork, and chicken). They both enjoyed their taco platters, and both agreed the pork was the best. I ordered the shredded beef burrito. Mine was tasty, the meat was fantastic. But it was served in a basket. With wax paper.... So cutting said burrito was difficult thanks to the basket. Then, of course, you get to the bottom of the burrito nd the wax paper is torn up and could be missing pieces.   So. Then... You wonder. Did I just eat wax paper?  All in all, it was tasty and a good experience. If we're in the area, we'll definitely go again! Maybe next time I'll ask for a plate. You know, like an adult."}
{"text":"This place is super delicious!!!! I'm very picky about my Mexican food and this place is great. I love their breakfast burritos and their tacos. Definitely a place to come for great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Brand new place. Just walked in and enjoyed the service and food. Pulled pork was very food with rice and beans. I suggest giving your taste buds a taste test here. Worth the stop."}
{"text":"Wonderful!! My husband and I were craving the food of our people (proudly Hispanic!) hard core. I was mourning the lack of access to street tacos (we were recently in Mexico with the fam) to cure my foodie cravings when we ran across this little treasure. Man, this food! Does it satisfy? NO. IT DOMINATES. It mugged my munchies like a 30-year mafia macho man and tucked me tight into a blanket of pure delight and satisfaction. Goodnight cravings!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped in here after watching roller derby. I was surprised by the atmosphere, way nicer than you would expect. The people in there are so nice, Excellent service! We had chips and guacamole, fresh made taco chips, very delicious! The guacamole was very fresh and tasty. I had the carne asada burrito, it is big. The meat had great flavor and very fresh tasting ingredients. My friend Laura has carne asada street tacos. She said they where delicious and 2 of them were filling. Also they provide a salsa bar, we tried the tomatillo sauce with good flavor. Definitely coming back to this jem :)"}
{"text":"It's not everyday that you encounter a restaurant that has their own butcher! You can taste the quality and care the chef places in each meat that is cooked. There is a smoker on premises and a flame broiler for the meats.   We came in and I ordered the chorizo and egg burrito with a horchata. The chorizo is very flavorful and made in-house. It was a huge burrito and every bite had a good balance of meat to egg. My husband had the chorizo breakfast platter which was a hearty portion that he enjoyed. The horchata was decent, but too sweet for me.   There is a great salsa bar with various salsas, limes, and pickled jalapenos. It's covered as well which I appreciate since it keeps things more hygienic.  The only real negative was that there isn't a soda fountain so all drinks are by the bottle or in a large glass container for aguas frescas. The sodas are only Jarritos brand, which I believe has no diet soda option.   Overall though, I'll definitely come here again for more tasty and quick options for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!! The smoked pork tacos is what I ordered. Great taste and twist on Mexican food. Try it and it will be on your list of faves!"}
{"text":"This food is so flavorful! How have I not been here sooner ?? I had the veggie burrito and hit up the salsa bar.  I'm very happy with this place!"}
{"text":"Sorry I I have to give this place a less than stellar review. Really disappointed because the reviews are high and the people were very friendly. Unfortunately, my burrito fell way below expectations. The meat to \"others\" ratio was poor making me feel like I was chewing sour cream, cheesy beans. On top of that the little meat that is there is absolutely charred to a crisp. Not only was the meat burned but it wasn't even hot making it highly questionable."}
{"text":"One of the worst taco shops I've ever been to- definitely the worst in Phoenix. Their dry and bland burritos lacked fresh authentic ingredients and were replaced by an excess of what tasted like unseasoned beans straight out of the can. The disappointingly small portions of rice and beans would have usually bothered me but after one bite the rest ended up in the trash anyway.   The service was terrible- and we got it to go... They confused our order, couldn't remember which burrito was which, and while we were waiting, we couldn't help but notice how dirty the silverware was on their appropriate abundance of unoccupied dining tables.   A must skip restaurant in a market that's  abundant with stellar Mexican food in every neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great customer service and really delicious freshly made chips and salsa (ask for it, it isn't complimentary)  I got the smoked chicken burrito and loved it, especially with the avocado salsa. Yum!! The portions are perfect, not too much, but just enough."}
{"text":"The Customer service is excellent!! The food is excellent!!! Hot plates and very reasonable prices. This was our first visit here and we loved it. I don't drink but I noticed this place is BYOB from noon to close.  I will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Food was great. The pork tacos were delicious and full of smokey flavors. The smoked medium salsa was awesome and the hot hot salsa had a great taste and wasn't just plain hot. Don't let this place fool you because it's small it's a must try!"}
{"text":"This place was delicious. We loved that you could go next door and buy your own beer. The chips and salsa were delicious. The food came out extremely quick and were great servers. The salsa bar was great to add some spices to the tacos. I got two tacos. One was barbacoa and the other was carne asada. The carne was well cooked and flavorful. I would go back here anytime for the pricing and great food and experience."}
{"text":"bomb carne asada, good salsa tacos and horchata. Would say the waiterless system would work better for this place. If i want a burrito I dont feel like I should have to tip for a sit down dinner.."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened and have ALWAYS had a great experience. It's an authentic, semi-hole in the wall, delicious taco spot.   Their meat is super tender and delicious, can't go wrong with the chicken! I'm a huge fan of the taco salad, but the burrito and tacos are prime time.   My husband fav part is the BYOB and liquor store next door. The perfect combo, especially for taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential....I paid 30.00 for a carne asada burrito, 3 shrimp tacos and two drinks....I would pay that for a burrito that was to big for me to finish and some killer shrimp tacos but neither met those criteria...the menu could be organized much better..........so to the owner here is my personal opinion of how to better things: Menu - you got to much repetitive stuff on there. You are either a build your own tacos, tortas and burritos or your not.....if you are then I just need to know the types of meats and extras that I can choose from.....if your not build your own then just tell me what is included in the tacos, tortas and burritos beside the meat......beans you either have refried or black beans not frijoles or black beans.......the shrimp tacos needs more substance mainly from the shrimp need a better batter and serve it with shredded cabage, chopped tomatoes with chopped white onion and cilantro, lightly squeezed lime topped with a cream either crema or guacamole cream........my burrito was almost flat. The flavor of the meat was very good but wasnt worth the price...you have something good here just need to up the food in order to require customers to pay 30.00 for a burrito, 3 tacos and 2 drinks....customer service was great.......guys are very friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I've kinda gotten burnt out over the hype of corporate Mexican food. So I'm slowly checking out local one-off Mexican restaurants and TC just happened to be in the same plaza of my new gym. Convenient.   Ordering was confusing. Do we order at the counter and sit down, or was TC going for a full service experience? I was let down to know that their version of carnitas was sold out for the day, a few minutes after I ordered it. Service was staggered, my friend received rice and beans a good 15 minutes before his tacos. I got my 4 tacos 12 minutes before he got his. To make up for this I was expecting the back of the house to maybe hook us up portion wise. Sadly we were skimped pretty bad on the taco filling. I know, these are under $2 but I wish I had ordered 5-7 tacos to get full rather than 4.   I have so much respect for such a varied salsa bar. I honestly had a fun time killing the longer then normal wait time by taking shots of the concoctions. A wide variety of peppers were represented as well as all the limes you need. A bright orange sauce seemed to be my favorite with lots of heat; an avocado and tomatillo salsa had heaps of cilantro that proved to go well with the tender al pastor. A few more morsels of meat would have gone a long way. The flavor is clearly there at TC but it appears they are a bit  too understaffed to provide a smooth dine-in right now. I will probably give them another try when they iron out the kinks because the way they handled their protein was admirable. Nothing was fatty and nothing was overcooked. With the local Filibertos serving speedy hot fire, TC has some catching up to do."}
{"text":"A friend of mine highly recommended this restaurant, but I noticed that the online reviews were variable. I decided to go anyway. It is very much a medium level restaurant: the meat was not particularly good, was quite a bit dry. It had a nice, clean atmosphere, and the owner was very nice. However, it felt like they were offering me chips and salsa after I paid up front, but before I left they handed me another check for $3. $3 for a small thing of chips and salsa? At a Mexican restaurant?? I would have given this place 3 stars, but that last little insults definitely pushed me over to a slightly negative review of this place. It's not horrible but I won't ever come back."}
{"text":"Um. BYOB. Delicious food, vegetarian options, and really fresh tasty sauces! Just the right level of customer service (not coming by constantly, but making sure you have what you need.) Very clean inside. Fiancé enjoyed a variety of street tacos and loved them. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this taco shop.   The guacamole is always fantastic. So often, we get gross guacamole at Mexican restaurants and i was pleasantly surprised at how fresh and flavorful TC's guacamole was. And the chips! Are fresh! Can you believe it?  I love all the tacos, but my favorite has to be the chorizo. Delicious.   It's a great place to sit in or pick up an order and eat back at the house. Service is always great as well."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review, experience much better! Portions were good and ingredients fresh.  Glad I gave it another chance!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place yesterday evening and I got the veggie burrito. And let me tell you, it was one of the best veggie burritos I have ever had. All the ingredients in the burrito went well together, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I was going to grab a slice at Venezzia's until I saw this place- And I glad I did! They smoke their meats and tomatoes for their salsa, which is very flavorful! They clearly take pride in quality and top notch customer service. Go Here! you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I think I just found my favorite taco shop. Lemme tell you guys. I've been waiting for a place like this. Everything made from scratch. They're tacos are amazing. Best part of this place, home made salsa. Holy cow their salsa is amazing! Btw you can BYOB! I recommend this place! Two thumbs way way up! And the guys who work there are the best! It's like being in somebody's home and them cooking their food with some kind of secret ingredients that was passed down from generation to generation. This is true Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Great first-time lunch experience at TC Tacos today!  We had the chorizo breakfast burrito and the smoked chicken, al pastor (with big chunks of pineapple) and carne asada (very tender beef) street tacos.  All the food was flavorful, made with quality ingredients and reasonably priced.  Especially enjoyed the homemade chorizo and appreciate the use of authentic Mexican cheese in all dishes. With great food, service and a clean restaurant, could not ask for anything more...Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"TC tacos has an incredibly friendly staff who is genuinely concerned about the quality of your experience and food. Normally, it'd be awkward when they ask you about the food, I often end up just nodding, but TC tacos has an incredible selection of fresh smoked meats.   No awkward deception necessary, the food is great. The smoked meats make this place stand above other taco joints, and the staff just add to the foodie experience."}
{"text":"Service and decor definitely score  5. The hostess/waitress was very sweet and helpful. The decor is artistically appealing. Both give TC a warm and welcoming feel.  I can only give the street tacos a 3. I love that there is a good choice selection, chorizo, carnitas, shrimp and more, however the meats lacked flavor. They were also cooked well; just needs a little seasoning.  I took advantage of the free horchata with check-in. It was good, but didn't have the homemade taste that I'm used to. It lacked flavor as well.  The menu items are priced low. They offer $1.50 tacos on Tuesday."}
{"text":"The BEST carne asada burritos and very good crispy fish tacos. One of my favorite Mexican places in all of Arizona. Their salsa bar is fresh and tasty with great variety. It may not look like much from the outside, but it's a MUST HAVE. Very friendly service and family owned and operated."}
{"text":"Amazing! The atmosphere is great. The service is pleasant. The food is great. Some of the best mexican food I've ever had. The thing that makes this place great is that the ingredients are all fresh and clean. The chips are freshly made. I would give five stars but I wish there was a tad bit more protein on the tacos. Aside from that definitely eat here. Keep the ingredients fresh and it would be the go to spot."}
{"text":"Okay the BYOB is fun but it's all about the good tacos here. I ordered the carne asada, barbacoa, and al pastor, a side of guacamole, and washed it down with horchata. My meal was very good. The meat was perfectly cooked, the chips were crisp, the tortillas were soft, and the guacamole actually tasted like ripe avocados. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the salsa but I think it's a flavor profile and heat preference that I'm not a fan of. Overall 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. Each time the quality and taste was different for the different meat options for the tacos. If the quality was consistent, I would give it 4 stars.  I do like the salsa and the guacamole is ok. I generally only like the guacamole I make so \"ok\" is a pretty high rating for me.  The folks that work here are super nice and I got good answers to my questions about gluten on my first visit which I very much appreciated."}
{"text":"I saw a sign out on Southern by LA Fitness for TC Street Tacos. Now I'm a fan of the real deal little tacos, and I happened to not have had lunch yet, so I decided to make a stop in.  The place just opened up last Wednesday. The decor is simple. They basically took over the Chinese place that was there, added some Mexican flair, and called it good. Fine by me.  I got the 3 taco dinner plate. They have at least a dozen taco options. The nice girl working behind the counter recommended the marinated chicken. I went ahead and got one of those, a carne asada taco, and a pork taco (can't remember which one). It came with rice and beans, a couple roasted peppers which were nice and spicy, shredded cabbage, and sliced radishes.  All three tacos were great. I added a little guacamole and homemade salsa from the salsa bar.  I'll definitely be back again. I'm so glad a good taco shop opened up in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile since I kept seeing their signs for 'street tacos'. I finally went in today to check them out. Ordered a couple barbacoa tacos and a chicken quesadilla with some salsa from the salsa bar. Everything was really good and the people working the front counter were very nice. I wouldn't hesitate to go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious and definitely worth the time to check it out. The chili rellenos are some of the best in town. The chips are all cooked to order and hot but not greasy when they hit the table. We've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is amazing, reasonably priced, and everyone who works here is super friendly.   I've gotten the taco special several times and tried a variety of meats, mostly the chicken and beef. I've also had the carnitas burrito and the dry ribs (which are AMAZING!!!). Everything has been spectacular.   Give it a try sometime!"}
{"text":"This place is SO good!!! Their guacamole, fresh hot chips, chicken burritos, smoked pork quesadillas are fantastic. Fresh food, cooked to order, fast and friendly!! You can sit down and order from your table, or order at the cashier To-Go. This is my second time here and I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The server was super nice. There's salsa bar which had some amazing guacamole, I totally reccomend it. The tacos are simple which is good in its own way. The breakfast burito ok too. Overall it's an enjoyable experience. Only one thing wrong. When going to take my order I saw a cockroach on the ground. Even upon sitting down I saw 2 baby cockroaches on my table. Maybe it'll be cleaner next time."}
{"text":"Friendly place with great owners and delicious food. Hot fresh chips and salsa customized for your taste buds. Chorizo and scrambled eggs platter with sautéed onions and jalapeños, plus the best rice and beans anywhere. \"Authentic Mexican cheese\" too."}
{"text":"What a treat to eat here! Everything my wife and I have tried tasted amazing. I really love that their food is so fresh and made to order.  Can't want to come over on a weekend, since they offer BYOB. This is a must try place to go!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed :-(. I really wanted to love this place and have been dying to try it based on the reviews. The carne asada was dry, the al pastor had nice spice to it but not much more flavor, the barbacoa had no flavor (I didn't even finish it), and the rice was really dry... So many fails I'm so sad. The horchata is very heavy on the cinnamon, but it was still ok. I can make better tacos at home with the marinated steak and al pastor at the ranch market.. bummer."}
{"text":"Clean place good food.. the carne asada needs to be cut into smaller pieces.. other than that it was good"}
{"text":"The Barbacoa street tacos are good and they seem to use fresh ingredients. The service was great, very friendly and laid-back. I only wish the hot salsa was more spicy."}
{"text":"Really great flavors. Loved it. Quiet place to work, watch the news and enjoy some authentic Tex-mex."}
{"text":"Cute place. On the expensive side though - I didn't see an itemized bill, so I'm not sure if I paid extra for guacamole on the vegetarian taco salad, and then extra again for friend peppers? The guacamole appetizer is over $7 and comes with a very small dish of guacamole, with a large plate of chips. At the end, I let the kids have deep fried ice cream, which seemed like deep friend corn flakes on the ice cream - not what I'm used to from having a dessert like that in the past. I had asked how big the ice cream dish was, and she made it seem small. So I ordered one for all 4 of us... definitely was too much - we could have easily order 2 to share. I wanted to love it, but our meals were \"meh\" - especially for the sucker punching bill at the end... over $50 for me and my kids. I figured around $40. Oh well... it's certainly not bad - just not one of our favorites."}
{"text":"This place was ok, the best meat is definitely the carne asada. The food wasn't very flavorful and the tacos only come with lettuce and pico, everything else is extra. The liquor store right next to the restaurant makes for a sketchy atmosphere, Taco Guild is 100% better and more authentic."}
{"text":"I was really excited about trying this place especially after the good reviews but I have to honestly say it was the most bland barbacoa taco I have ever eaten.  It literally tasted like a roast from the oven with a ton of lettuce on it.  The fish taco was more like a fish bite taco.  The fish was nicely breaded and flavored well but it was a fish nugget.  Maybe I was here on an off day but it was the most bland Mexican food I have ever eaten in my life.  The salsa bar was good and that is the only reason I gave it two stars.  Well the staff was nice too."}
{"text":"I had to be super fast because of a meeting and just ran in for fish tacos. Incredibly good and tasty and I so appreciated the speed. Thanks. Will be back for a more leisurely meal."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past week, so you know the food has to be pretty good!  First time I went, I got the steak burrito dinner.  It came with a burrito, rice, and beans for about $9.  Not a bad deal... except when you realize that the burrito alone is only about $6... and the rice and beans they serve in the \"dinner\" are not that great-tasting.  The rice especially was not my favorite.  So second time I went, I just ordered the al pastor burrito alone.  Out of the two meats I tried, I think I prefer the steak to the pork.  I really like the \"smokey spicy\" salsa in their salsa bar.  It's not that hot, but it adds nice flavor to the burritos.  I overheard them saying that they got their recipes from Mexico City, so I guess they're pretty authentic to true \"street\" tacos!  This place is great, although I'll try to limit my visits in the future since the food isn't really all THAT healthy for you :P"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends on a whim & was pleasantly surprised! The menu is small but everything is made from scratch. I got the huevos rancheros, my husband got the breakfast burrito, & my friend got the veggie burrito. All items were delicious & the owner made sure to stop by & tell us about all of the salsa ingredients & meats that they smoke in house. This place is also BYOB friendly which is a huge plus since it's right next to the liquor store! The horchata was refreshing & not too sweet & the guacamole was extremely fresh. The couple who runs this place is thorough & truly cares about the quality of their food. I have no complaints & will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lets support this local place to eat! Authentic jewel hiding in a small strip mall. I know authentic street tacos from the gourmet, dressed up tacos, and if you're looking for dressed down and real, this Is it. Don't let the strip mall location deter you from coming in. These are homemade original street tacos. I received friendly service. I got several different variations of their street tacos. And they all had their own distinct flavors. Herbs,spices, cilantro, an explosionsion of flavors,and it's not ALL spicy. You have options including seafood. I ordered take out and will be going back soon. Great prices. There's usually a guy spinning a sign on the corner. I beep every time! 4 stars due to inside decor  being a bit worn out. Could be made more modern looking inside, but with our support of their business, that could happen for them."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa! We ordered a bunch of different tacos and really liked all of them, but the al pastor was BOMB. Also, the service was impressive. Our waitress was attentive, plus she went out of her way to make our kids happy and comfortable. Hopefully we will make it back sometime!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Love the update they did to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Customer service was the best I've had however the taste factor was not there. Carne asada was rubbery and didn't taste right. The chorizo was soggy and greasy. Great staff but they need to fire the cook. Besides the food, there was flies and it was hard for eat with smacking them away. Don't go here for tacos."}
{"text":"I used to eat at TC Taco frequently and really liked their street tacos, especially the Al pastor and fish tacos. I saw a few recent, bad reviews and one mentioned a change in ownership so I thought I'd visit them again to see what the hubbub was all about. I ordered the three taco plate with two fish and one Al pastor for pick up. When I got there the first thing that I noticed was a sign on the door that stated \"BYOB is back.\" BYOB was one of the things that made TC Taco stand out to me, someone told me the person who owned the liquor store next door also owned the TC Taco, so that kind of made me think the new owner thing was true. Once I stepped inside I was pretty sure it was now under new ownership, the inside has been redone and the salsa bar is gone, I also noticed the usual aroma wasn't as strong either. When I visited in the past I could smell the different kinds of meat cooking. Anyway, I got my tacos and I immediately noticed the tortillas were a little different, not bad, just different. The Al pastor taco, however, was not as I remember it. It was not as tender and juicy, the pieces of meat seemed to be a different cut as well or prepared differently, it was ok, but not as good as it used to be. It was also lacking in spiciness, before I could barely eat two Al pastor tacos. The fish tacos we're still good and it seems they even have bigger pieces of fish in them, so that was a nice surprise. I will probably still get tacos here, but not as much as I used to, previously I would have given this place four stars."}
{"text":"Came back. Everything was great, and hot! Had the carne asada street tacos, and they were great. I'll be a loyal customer as I work nearby."}
{"text":"Second time eating here. Burrito is not that big, in fact it's the smallest of anywhere I have eaten. But ok, who cares if it's giant if it tastes awful right. Here is the problem, one time I go and get burrito and it cost $6 and change. Cool right? That even cancels out the small size. Then I go back and I'm charged $10 and change!!!!!! Really???? That's all I got mind you, a burrito......to go......same kind as before with exact same toppings, carne asada.  So when things like that happen, I'm not about to argue what their prices are (menu says $6.85) I'm just going to pay them and never come back. Maybe they just make up the prices as they go along. Say what you want about filibertos, but it's a good size burrito and every time I go it's $8.30. 7:00 am at Broadway.......$8.30 10:00pm at Elliott.........$8.30. Unless your putting filet minon in the burrito I'm not sure how it cost almost $11!!!!!! I wanted to make them my regular spot, stick with filibertos."}
{"text":"This little spot was so good! They have a very straightforward menu, yet there are lots of options. They offer burritos, salads, street tacos, quesadillas with your choice of meat & of course they offer fresh dips and avocados. We ordered 4 street tacos (barbacoa, grilled shrimp, chicken & carne asada) along with a small chicken quesadilla. They were so so so so good! I loved the chicken. It is very flavorful!  We also got an horchata which was delish!.....to say the least. We went with the tomatillo dip & avocado jalapeno. Let me say, the avocado jalapeno dip was to die for! So yummy yet not super hot, it was just perfect! The gentleman who helped us was so nice & made sure we enjoyed our visit! We will DEFINITELY BE BACK!!"}
