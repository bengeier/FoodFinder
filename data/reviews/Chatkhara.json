{"text":"Was in the area and decided to try out a new Pakistani restaurant. I first had a bun Kebob, which is a desi style burger basically and it was okay, a bit too spicy for my taste and I thought the Kebob patty was too soft. Wasn't too happy with this.  I did however come back a second time and tried the chaat papri and the beef Kebob paratha roll. They were both amazing! The chaat papri was really flavorful and the roll was just the perfect level of spicy and just overall really good. I recommend this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"I am giving it a 5 star because this place has the best of what they call a bun kabob. It is awesome and the paratha wrap with chicken is awesome.    The best part of this place?  The owner is a great lady who greets you with a big smile and treats you very well and treats you as if she is your auntie :)    This place needs to improve on cleanliness."}
{"text":"Really bad service. Extremely rude staff.  Ordered 2 halwa puri, 1 bun kabab and 1 roll. Took 25 mins for halwa puri another 10 for bun kabab and the roll never came. Reminded many times and the answer the staff gave was we will get our food when we do.  Got tired and asked for refund for the roll because did not look I was going to get it got real attitude and rude behavior plus nasty comments from the cashier. Would not recommend this resturant to anyone. Real bad service, food and it is by far one of the worst experiences I have had in a resturant in my life."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today. Saw the signs for cheap dishes when I went to El Sombrero yesterday.  Thought I'd give 'er a go.    Went in at 11:40, starving, knew I was going to order take out but not sure what I was going to get.  Decided on chicken biriyani  and a Kabab paratha roll (chicken).  I had never had the kabab roll but it looked interesting and it was only $2.99.  The biriyani was $4.99.  I ate the roll first. It is made from paratha and had some sort of shredded chicken kebab inside with something crunchy, like cabbage. It also had an interesting sauce that gave it a nice kick. I was really surprised. I like it a lot! I would order that again for sure. You can get it witih fries for $4.99.  On to the biriyani.  It comes in a smaller size rectangular container and you think you're not getting a lot, but IT'S PACKED full and has some weight to it.  Very happy about that. The chicken is burried in it, there are some big pieces, and seems to be a bit dry but it's still flavourful and I actually don't eat much of the chicken anyway.   It's not the most amazing biriyani I've ever had, but it's tasty, and does the trick.. and for $4.99, I'll definitely be back. to order it again.  It could easily serve two people for lunch. How awesome is that?!?"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Horrible service and even more horrible people working at this restaurant.  Ordered some food which wasn't good at all. Sorry but this restaurant needs some serious treatment."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some good ol' greasy \"nashta\" (breakfast) and caved in to satisfy our craving at Chatkhara, which is right next door to Silver Spoon. I've been here once before, several months ago.  Turns out they have a great weekend morning special right now, not sure how long it will last - 1 nashta takeout for $2.99 (dine-in for $3.99) + tax.   Each nashta came with 2 poori (think of it as a deep-fried roti/thin naan), potato curry, chickpea curry, and halwa (translates to semolina). Poori was crispy and delicious. The chickpea curry was tasty and a bit spicy, but too oily - we poured out oil from the top of the container before eating. The potato curry and halwa were average.  Overall, a cheap, satisfying and unhealthy meal and I'll come back in a few months when the craving hits again ;)  Picture shows 2 nashtas (they are packaged together)."}
{"text":"We stopped over Friday night, sign said Open but they said that they are only taking take out orders.  Food was in-expensive 2 bun kabobs 1 beef nan roll (bread is greek gyro bread, not nan) 1 fish and fries ( 7-8 pieces of fish) total after taxes was $21.xx  Food prices were excellent and food was pretty good, however cleanliness did not seemed as their daily routine.  Carpet is now black and sticky.  I'll go back for the take out again."}
{"text":"My mom and I were at Hartland Shopping centre, when we came across this restaurant in one of the plazas. We ordered the Naan and Chicken Kabob, as well as a Dahi Gol Gappa (it's this chickpea, yogurt and tamarind sauce mixture served in these crispy shells - delicious!), and really liked our food. The kabob was pretty good, and they were able to make it mild like I wanted, but I'm told they can make it as spicy as people want it.   The place has an extensive menu, and I'd like to go back and try some of the other options, including a Lahori fish dish that looked like a Pakistani take on fish and chips :)   The only thing that could \"improve\" is that it does take a while for the food to be served. If you think positively, that means they're preparing it fresh. If you're in a hurry, then... I suggest you learn to think more positively :)"}
{"text":"We were visiting Canada from Florida, US and decided to go here for brunch. Their Halwa Poori nashta is one of the best I have had. Chanay, Aalo Tarkari and Halwa are delicious. I ordered Bihari Kabab and they were okay. Naan is pretty decent. Chai was pretty good as well. They only take debit and cash. I'll surely make a stop here to try other entrees when I'm in Mississauga next time."}
{"text":"So I went there in the morning. Asked for nihari but the guy who baked the naan bread wasn't in yet. So I settled for the breakfast, puri channa. Just before the lady could bring me the breakfast she came and told me that the cook has come so she can give me nihari and naan. I said great!   A few minutes later, she brought out my food but it was again channa puri. Weird!  The puris were good but the Chanas and aloo bhaji were bland. It needed more flavor. I enjoyed silverspoon's (next door) puri breakfast much better which I tried a month back.  Also the service was very slow. It took quite some time for the already made food to be served."}
