{"text":"We love this place, just recently found it. The barista was super friendly, pleasant and made great coffee. Snacks, breakfast munchies, and the lunch looks good but haven't tried it yet. Great to find a nice spot in fairview.  Will keep going!"}
{"text":"Nice little coffee shop right off of Charlotte hwy. love their cold brew and iced Vietnamese coffee. Yummy treats too!"}
{"text":"Good coffee and wonderful pastries. And the people are really nice. Just a little out of the normal drive path for me otherwise I would go more often."}
{"text":"First time going to Mojo, and it's amazing.  This will now be our new \"daily stop\". Cold brew iced was awesome and the latte was delicious"}
{"text":"We were searching for a little coffee shop and bakery type place before beginning our drive home after a mini-vacation in Asheville. The coffee shop we really enjoyed the day before didn't open until later (so strange for a coffee shop imo!), so we searched for something outside of the city so we wouldn't need to contend with parking meters and/or finding parking. And, this place definitely didn't have those kind of city problems!   Mountain Mojo is really a cute little cabin near Asheville. I was surprised by the exterior, but it seemed fitting for this charming little shop. There is local art on the walls, comfy couches, and some table seating inside and out. There's not a huge selection of baked goods, but they do seem to try to have vegan or gluten free items available. The winning food item we purchased was probably the homemade granola which was a yogurt granola. After convincing my kiddo the banana bread was actually cake, she enjoyed that too.   The coffee is good, much better than hotel coffee would have been in the morning (the sad hotel breakfast and desire for something quick is what prompted our search in the first place!). It wasn't as good as the coffee we had the day before, but still did the job.   The service was friendly and efficient here too.  Overall, it's a fine coffee shop. It's not one I'd go out of my way to get a cup of coffee from though. But, if I were local to the area and wanted to sort of get away from things, this would be an ideal escape spot for the coziness, remoteness, and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"My coworker and I were staying in Fairview after a conference in Asheville and decided to grab a quick caffeine fix here, and we're SO glad we did! The vibe is very cool and casual and both our coffees were absolutely **amazing.** I'm so used to needing to doctor my coffee after getting it but that would've been a crime with the Mexican Mocha I got; it was beyond perfect. Definitely returning the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Mojo is a great place that all my friends and I love. It's a nice place for group studying after school. :)"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town, and quite frankly I'm a bit of a Starbucks ho.  So was disappointed that the closest 'bucks was way further than I would want to drive, considering that the friends we were staying with was a good ten minute trek up the mountain above Fairview.  We had passed this place on our way out for the day and turned around thinking it might a possible option.  First sip was, well different.  But the more I got into my cup the more I realized I had found someone that could make a better latte than Starbucks ever dreamed of.  On our way to visit the Biltmore on Sunday, we were anxious to stop by here again.  Alas, they were closed (CLEARLY POSTED ON THEIR HOURS SIGN MONTE!), so we disappointingly drove to the Starbucks outside of the Biltmore gate.  Monday morning they were open and we were able to partack in latte heaven one last time before we left for home.  The owner and her staff were super sweet and helpful.  They have assorted pastries and sandwiches (which were good!).  Wide open space, very cute and cozy place to hang out if we'd had more time.  As someone previously said, there is a drive thru, and they also have a cute little patio on the side.  All in all a awesome little place.  We wish them lots of luck, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this little coffee shop off the beaten path.  Located east of Asheville, it's the only one within a few miles in its area.  The shop itself is open and comfortable, but has a drive-through for folks on the go.  The options for coffee include 4 single-origins, ranging from light to dark roasts and a decaf option.  They have a pretty impressive selection of homemade pastries (didn't notice any savory ones), including a few gluten-free offerings.  The employees were incredibly warm, and even offered to-go cream, sugar and a discount when I ordered 12 individual cups to take away.  If you're in the area (and not on a Sunday, when they're closed), absolutely worth a stop."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches are awesome! I tried the smoked salmon and turkey green bagel, both were unique (in a good way). The olive tapenade used on the turkey Greek was delicious. Also tried the Toddy coffee iced and black, it has a very strong taste for those that like a darker roast. And my mother tried the green Yerba mate, it's a very original flavor that taste like genuine tea. Very natural tasting."}
{"text":"Yay, drive through coffee!! This is a super cute place with friendly staff. I've never encountered them being closed without notice, but funny thing I do, I tend to frequent businesses during their normal hours of operation. You can find these hours easily by Googling their name and looking at their Facebook page. They have never been open Sundays and that is clearly posted on their Facebook page. I don't understand posting a negative review of a business because you were having a \"throw caution to the wind\" kind of day and not at least calling/Googling to find out if a place was open.   I'm personally thrilled they are there and love the convenience of the drive through. Besides Mountain Mojo there are approximately zero options in Fairview to do this unless you count Sonic, which I do not.  They have a nice selection of pastries and snacks, but I have only tried their bagels, which come toasted and smothered in cream cheese. I'm not a muffin person but their strawberry muffin was super moist/yummy. They have lots of coffee drink options, although I usually just stick to regular coffee but I am glad that they offer some healthier coffee add ins (skim/soy milk, stevia instead of Splenda, etc.)  Oh and their open/close sign is adorable. Another clear indication of them being open/closed. ;-)"}
{"text":"I love this place, I'm a fan of their amazing pumpkin chocolate bread, iced Vietnamese! Also they have so super comfy couches and the staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Pleasant service, unobtrusive background music, comfy seats, tasty treats.     I really enjoy coming here"}
{"text":"Cool Fairview Cafe with great coffee drinks, pastries and a delicious breakfast tortilla eggs and sausage wrap!  Great place to meet for coffee or grab a cup on your way in to Asheville.  The apple muffins are insanely good!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place off the beaten path! The reclaimed wood touches and delicious coffee set the tone for a great day! They offer alternative milks and the cold toddy was delicious!"}
{"text":"It was exactly what we expected from a coffee shop.  We got two mocha lattes and a vegan chocolate pumpkin muffin.  The service and coffee were good. The coffee is as good or better than an upscale coffee shop and the prices were comparable as well. The muffin was excellent.  This is awesome since it is easy to mess up vegan baked goods.  I would highly recommend visiting Mountain Mojo's.  Side note: There was a fascinating fellow with a pet broccoli visiting with another gentleman at a table.  I believe they were filming the interaction. Quirky and fun...kind of like the coffee shop."}
{"text":"Mountain Mojo is one of my favorite places.  The coffee is good and reasonably priced (there is a $5.00 minimum if you use a credit card, though), the atmosphere is great, the tables are nice and big if you go to get some work done, and the employees are always very nice.  My only complaint is that their pastry selection is hit or miss (it is always homemade, from what I've seen, so this is understandable).   It is busier in the morning, obviously.  So don't plan on having a big table to yourself if you go early."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this coffee joint! Masters of cold brew, love the hot coffees in the colder weather, and being able to treat myself to a baked treat occasionally is the best! And oh yeah...the baristas are always so nice and smiley. Not like a lot of other coffee places."}
{"text":"Super friendly and helpful!! Coffee is delish and not super expensive!! The barista even gave us extra coffees because they didn't want to throw it away! Great atmosphere and a cute little patio for outdoor seating. Would definitely come back again tomorrow."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , my latte was really good . Lots of variety and staff was friendly . Looking forward to coming back"}
{"text":"This spot is my go-to and I am so grateful that it's located in Fairview. The atmosphere is comfy, cozy, and inviting. There are many options for breakfast food (bagels, parfaits, etc) and for baked goods (GF muffins, banana bread, cookies, etc). The drinks are always made well and there are plenty of options for your drink order. The staff makes sure to greet me and I genuinely enjoy my interactions with them. Overall, a wonderful coffee shop and a beautiful community in Fairview."}
{"text":"Mountain Mojo is an outstanding coffee shop. Friendly and competent staff.  Warm and inviting ambience with great music that entertains without being intrusive.  Great coffee and bagels.  Great place to bop in for a cup of joe, or hang out for the afternoon.  The place is well managed."}
