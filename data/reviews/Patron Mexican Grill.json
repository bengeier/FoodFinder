{"text":"This place currently offers the best Mexican in the Wexford area.  The food is pretty fresh and the prices are reasonable.  The staff is helpful, but you often find a language barrier in asking difficult questions about the food (if you know Mexican food you'll be fine.)  It's not the best, but since Three Amigos in Gibsonia closed this place has the best Mexican in the area.  They have a pretty good happy hour and are good for groups.  I would recommend this place over other Mexicans spots in Wexford and even over some places downtown."}
{"text":"Good food, great service,reasonable prices. Was very busy. Only one problem, Very noisy, hard to converse with people at own table. Need to cover that concrete floor, reduce echo."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this restaurant was a disappointment. Many got me hyped up for the great food, but what I ate was equivalent to a hastily made take out order. It was good enough but not exquisite. Even though everyone and eveything, from the waiters to the furniture and the Mexican looking bricks, was Mexican, the food was a sub-par attempt at good Mexican food. After going to Mexico for authentic Mexican food, this did not come close. The only thing that excited me were the free chips and salsa that were served before the meal. Maybe next time, I'll save money and a bad food experience by just ordering a drink and snacking on chips."}
{"text":"The service was good it has a bright decor that seems welcoming and the food was excellent. I can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"The waiter got our order wrong and the food was very bland. Very disappointed with the whole dining experience."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great atmosphere! It was the best Mexican food we've eaten! My husband and I do not get many date nights these days (we have 4 children) so we're pretty choosy on where we go when we do get out. This place was definitely worth the money and time! Lots of food for the price and very fresh!!"}
{"text":"The quantity of food was too much but quality was not good. Their chips and salsa were like dripping oil. We ordered a burrito and a Fahita but same was the case with them. They were like fried in a very old oil which hasn't been replaced since years and the taste of oil ruined all the dishes."}
{"text":"Another great place to take a group of people. Good food and drink! Then we go across the street to another bar usually. I enjoy the burritos here especially. I've never had bad service either. The pace is huge, too so when we take a group there is usually seating for all of us. Definitely try the fast lunch special menu. FAST!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have been there at least a half dozen times.  If you are looking for something unique, this is not it.  If you are looking for a well decorated, fun, Mexican restaurant with good food, this is the place.  The bill is always lower than I expected, the food is good, the service is good.  I agree that you may not see inspiration in the food, but you will enjoy a nice Mexican meal in a nice environment."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Pittsburgh suburbs.  Frozen margaritas are amazing and strong.  Staff is always friendly, and chips with your own salsa bowl is a plus!"}
{"text":"First time there was fantastic. Our server, Oscar, recommended the Choripollo. It was a combination of chorizo sausage, chicken, and delicious queso. One of the best things I've had. I have high standards for Mexican food and would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff... Our waitress Mercy was Great... Very friendly and helpful.   The food was tasty and the portions large.  We started with the guacamole, which is prepared at the table. We had the Carnitas and the Arroz con pollo...  Would come back again"}
{"text":"Really mediocre.  Nachos for appetizer.  Mix of some bland cheese sauce and some shredded white cheese -  zero flavor - and not in the oven long enough to melt the cheese.  Fish tacos -- corn tortillas wrapped around tiny pieces of fish with lots of fried breading.  served with a creamy sauce and some boring salsa.  No cabbage.  Nothing worth eating.  My friend had a chimichanga.... doused with that same bland flavorless cheese sauce.    Service was fine.   Food was terrible."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food in a great environment! I have been back here several times and it's quite a ways out of my way just for the food. My favorite is their Chicken Chimichanga.  The restaurant itself is full of bright vibrant colors, dim lighting hand-carved booths and tables. When it's busy it does get a little loud but it just adds to the environment for me."}
{"text":"The guacamole $4 appetizer dip was small and greyish and when i told the waiter at the end, he commented with a straight face \"really? It was from today or yesterday?! But i am happy to tell the chef\". I strongly advised him also to tell his boss not to serve yesterday's guacamole!!!  Also, they didnt card any of us 5 ppl, including my 19-yr old friend.  The frozen margeritas had all artificial flavoring but werent too bad. And the cheese nachos were good."}
{"text":"Delicious and GREAT service! Coffee was horrible (I know, who orders coffee at a Mexican restaurant? But it's 1° out!) Fast service, nice menu selection, and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Food is great here, but super overpriced considering 60% of the plate is made up of rice and refried beans. Maybe in a near dystopian future were rice and bean futures exponentially rise due to world over population I can see paying $15 for dinner here. Wish they would put more chicken in their lunch menu burrito."}
{"text":"The food is so good I'm actually happy I work a block away seriously. I'm going to bring my friends and family here."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place when my wife and I walked in and got some delicious tortilla chips and salsa right away. The chips were the only good thing we ate at Patron....  I ordered the beef tacos and honestly they were the worst tacos I ever had. I would've been happy eating Taco Bell rather than eating those tacos. There was no spice, just plain  bland ground beef, lettuce and cheese. The tortillas tasted like they came out of a grocery store bag and they were stale. It also didn't help that there was no hot sauce on the table as is customary in Mexican restaurants so I was unable to even add taste to these sad excuses for tacos. My wife's \"steak\" quesadilla was no better. No spices and the beef was chewy. She said it tasted as if it was boiled. One thing is for sure, we will never come here again."}
{"text":"Wish I had something positive to say about our lunch here. The food was just not good. We both ordered the lunch fajitas and they had absolutely no flavor, they were completely bland and lacking even salt. My boyfriend found a huge chunk of unripe avocado in his guacamole. Our waitress was very nice when I sent my food back and she removed it from our bill. The manager on the otherhand was awful. He came to see what the issue was, instead of just apologizing and moving on he argued with us and tried to explain how we were wrong and the food was seasoned fine and that he had never gotten complaints before. Comletely unprofessional and out of line. He completely ignored our mention of the unripe avocado as well. Definitely not going to be going back"}
{"text":"I generally like this place for going to sit down and eat, and sometimes I get takeout from here, too.  The food is always good and friendly in person service.  However, the past couple times I've called in to place and order for takeout, the people who answered the phone put me on hold and either forgot about me or purposely let me sit so long on hold that I'd get tired of waiting and hang up.  I was irritated the first time it happened, but then when it happened again recently, I was mad enough to come write a negative review on a good restaurant because you just don't do that to people who call in trying to give you good business.  I have been a good customer for years and to ask if i can hold and then never come back to the phone to take my order is rude as hell.  Bad business to do that.  Fix your phone skills Patron."}
{"text":"Authentic cuisine, very friendly ambience,  like eating with family.  Favorites are camarones patron, fish tacos, arroz con pollo, sopapillas, and flan."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time tonight and really enjoyed our meal.  The decor is beautiful and the food was very good.  I had a chile reileno and a beef taco with a side of refried beans and my husband had a beef fajita burrito.  Both of our meals were tasty, spiced well and very fresh.  We moved here from southern California and spend at least 2 months in the winter in California so we eat a lot of Mexican food and this food was as good as what we get in California.  I read the critical reviews about the Margaritas and found my Margarita to be quite good.  It was tangy tasted fresh and had enough salt on the glass to suit my taste.  We were also happy that valet parking was available because, as those who live in Pittsburgh know, parking in this city is a problem."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a new mexican place and now I am hooked! The guac and queso and really good, the quac has a little kick to it but still good. The reason for the 4 stars is the slow service. We waited a while for our food and refills but I will be back!"}
{"text":"Everyone that works here is really nice and there is an all around homey feeling.  The food was really good and took only about 10 minutes to get to our table after we had ordered. Also, the chips and salsa were very good too. If you like salsa that's more tomato-y/garlic-y it is the best!  I will defiantly come back to Patron in the future for a good Mexican food craving fix."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong at Patron. It's always busy for a reason. Authentic and tasty food, great decor, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  Love the service, food, and drinks.  My husband and I love to come here during the week after work for the specials.  I absolutely love this place. It is not the taco bell craps. Simply delicious and worth every penny. We never spend more than $25 During the week and my husband is a big guy. Try it you will love it!!!"}
{"text":"The worst fake mexican food that I ever  tasted. There was no flavor or seasoning  on the shrimp faitatas. The frozen Mango margaritas were descent though. I was told to go to Las Palmas and El Milagro on Beachview Blvd in Beachview for authentic mexican  food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food here! We love the salsa, and the meals we've ordered during our many visits are always tasty. The only reason I didn't give Patron five stars is that it falls short of what we consider great mexican. There is no heat in the food at all...though tasty and seasoned well, we miss the heat of true mexican food. (We lived in Phoenix, Arizona, for 8 years, so our views may differ from yours!)  However, my favorite dish is the pollo amigo, and I love it beyond words for the flavor alone. And don't forget to order some flan! They do it right at Patron's!  We'll be back time and again...as I write this, I'm craving the salsa big time...we better go soon! :-)"}
{"text":"Big fan of Patron.  We live close by and go there frequently.  Monday night is taco night - i believe the taco's are 95 cents.  They always get a good crowd on Monday and the service is very fast.    I think this is the best Mexican place in the North Hills.  Great chips and salsa (free)."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst Mexican food I've ever had. My husband and I went here last week. He ordered tacos and I had echiledas. The tacos where very bland with no taco sauce. We had to ask for more salsa just to put on the tacos. My enchiladas where bland. The rice and pinto beans had no seasoning at all. I also ordered queso which tasted like velvetta cheese. This place was a waste of time and money. Do not come to this place. I thought Mexican food was about spice and flavors. This place is for people who have a bland palate."}
{"text":"Food was good, flexible with choice of chicken/beef/beans/cheese being mixed (you don't need to have all your Enchiladas with one single choice of fillings), waiter for our table was very friendly and sweet, Margaritas were under $3 (for flavoured Margaritas add $1), but I'm giving 3 because of the Lady's Room. Maybe it is unfair to rate a restaurant not for its food, and my apologies if this would offend those who were expecting food reviews and also can't stand toiletry issues... But I really expect to see a sanitary disposal in EACH of the chambers, not one big trash can in front of the entrance door that's for hand towels."}
{"text":"My positive review is based on $1 taco Mondays.  You get what you pay for...  beef, bean, and chicken hard-shell tacos are $1 and margaritas are $3.  I am a fan of all of the proteins.  Chicken is mixed with fajitas and the flavor is variable depending on the week.  Beef and chicken are a little more consistent.  All three come with cotija and lettuce. The refried beans are really good too ($2-3) and the free homemade salsa is awesome.  The quality of the service depends on the individual server and how busy the kitchen is that night.  I have had service that ranges from impeccable to appalling, but it's cheap so I can't complain.  Again, I would only recommend this on Mondays for the special, however, they can't always take large groups (they don't take reservations on Monday nights).  On other days, it's too expensive for the quality and too disorganized. Parking in this area is usually a pain if you have to stash your car; expect to drive around for awhile."}
{"text":"The food is pretty authentic to some parts of Mexico: it can be heavy, laden with rich sauces, and lots of cheese. The rice and beans are great--it's often the simple foods that are the hardest to do well. They offer a choice of either refried beans or black beans, and either are good, but I prefer the whole black beans. I often order the shrimp quesadillas, they're flavorful but not too heavy. The camarones diablo is another good shrimp dish.   Another reviewer mentioned the decor is rather vibrant. I've been to quite a few restaurants in various parts of Mexico that have very similar decor (not tourist restaurants). It's not necessarily my taste, either, but it probably reflects what the owners are familiar with.   The staff are wonderful. Friendly and very welcoming. Some speak Spanish, others don't, but those who do will gladly converse in Spanish."}
{"text":"I literally just went to Patron and was completely ignored.  I sat in a beautiful room aside the bar and several servers not only looked at me; but made eye contact then proceeded to ignore me.  I am not sure if I was ignored because I arrived just a few moments prior to their lunch menu ending or if this is just their typical service. I like the food at the other Patron restaurants; but when I can't even get a glass of water what is the point of continuing the meal."}
{"text":"Just left Patrons. The fish taco dinner SUCKED!!! No rice, No beans, No guacamole, No sour cream. The server had no idea what was going on. He had to go back to kitchen 3 times after bringing our food for the balance of food ordered. This place was BAD BAD BAD. I hope the new restaurant in Cranberry doesn't suck like this place!!!!"}
{"text":"My large family of 14....and that wasn't all of us, had dinner there last night. The service was excellent!  We all ordered different things and everyone loved their food!  The fresh chips & salsa.... unbelievably addictive! I also ordered meals to go for my older children who couldn't come, my youngest son loved the food so much asked me for another whole meal to also take home!  Everyone was so nice & the atmosphere is so HAPPY!....Especially on a cold winter night! We will be going back!"}
{"text":"After living in Texas and used to the good Tex-Mex food down there, this is pretty authentic.  Bright and cheery place but can be very noisy.  Prices are good and plenty of food and very quick service."}
{"text":"This place is the quintessential crappy Mexican restaurant. Plastic fiesta plates, cheese on everything, rice + refried beans overflowing the plate...  The food is weak. It's quite surprising how bad it is given that it is close to some really good and trendy restaurants (e.g., Spoon, BRGR, etc)."}
{"text":"We really enjoy eating here, great chips, fajitas, tacos and service. A great experience every time we visit :)"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening at prime dinner time...6 pm...and only had to wait 10 mins for a table. Staff was pleasant, but service was very, very slow. Chips and salsa are excellent and refills were plentiful! Fajitas were super yummy, portions are huge, and prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I visited here with two friends, the restaurant was busy but we were seated promptly by a friendly host.  Chips and salsa arrived immediately.  As did our waiter to take drink orders.  They have a selection of tequilas to make your margarita with...and that is where the good stuff stops.  We ordered 3 margaritas with different tequilas.  Why oh why in Pittsburgh do they continue to use bottled sours mix???  The stuff is just nasty and there isn't a real lemon or lime in it! If you are a Mexican restaurant you are going to sell a ton of margaritas, I guess I just don't understand. I ordered a beer as I couldn't/didn't want to drink that nasty margarita!   We ordered chicken nachos and a chile rellano  appetizer.  Along with a side of pico de gallo and jalapenos ala carte.  When the appetizers came the chile rellano was drenched in sauce.  This is something else I see in Pittsburgh all the time.  They make many dishes (wet) I don't know why you would put a ton of sauce on a deep fried item as it just makes it really mushy. The jalapenos were jarred and I asked for fresh and the waiter quickly brought them out.  Why when you are paying for them would they give you jarred? The chicken nachos were very good and everyone agreed that they were the best thing about this meal.  Moist shredded chicken with chihuahua cheese. I had the Enchiladas de Suiza which are grilled chicken with a green sauce, topped with white cheese.  I thought the sauce was flavorless. I ate one of them, and boxed to take home. I was going to feed them to my friends dog when I got back home but ended up throwing them away.   I don't know how that happens with a salsa verde there was no hot sauce on the table to fix it either. My two friends had the same dish which was the Enchiladas Supremo, this consisted of one of each cheese, chicken, beef and bean enchiladas with red sauce rice and beans.  My one friend said it looked like dog food! Ha  So I know it is Pittsburgh, but this place is not authentic. I cook better Mexican at my house.  My friends and I will probably never return.  There are just better places to eat out there. Oh and another thing when approaching the front door there is a hand written sign on how to open the door.  Seriously fix your door handle (Wexford is an upscale area).    Pros:  Friendly staff            Chicken nachos Cons:  Bottled sours              jarred pickled jalapenos               flavorless food"}
{"text":"We stopped there on Saturday for lunch.  Our lunch was awesome.  We go the fajita taco salad.  While you may be thinking yeah okay it's a salad.  It was not your normal salad.  It was served in a fried flour tortilla in the shape of a taco.  The filling was your typical fajita fillings.  However the chicken was great!  The marinade was flavorful and the chicken was grilled just right.  This is a must try for anyone that likes Mexican food."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and loved it! The guacamole is delicious and made right at your table from whole avocados, fresh cilantro, onions, tomatoes, and jalapeños. The servers are very attentive, replenishing your warm chips faster than you can eat them. Great atmosphere, good prices, and several vegetarian options. I plan to return on a Monday for their 95-cent tacos!"}
{"text":"Not real mexican. From eating mexican food before from actual mexican people this does not compare. The food is terrible. The beans were almost water. The bathrooms were odd."}
{"text":"Driving by on the weekends, the parking lot at Patron Mexican Grill is so full.  Well that brought my wife into Patron for lunch to find out what the big deal must be about.  Well, it's not that great.  Here's the lowdown: - Chips and salsa:  free and tasty.  The best deal about this visit. - House margarita:  a bit bitter and large.  At least it was large. - Chicken fajitas (my wife ordered this) - Enchiladas Suizas:  watery green sauce, not much cheese, chicken was OK.  Four chicken enchiladas altogether and just mediocre.  Not that tasty.  Unfortunately, our first visit will be our last."}
{"text":"We were a little skeptical after all the bad reviews we saw on Yelp, but quite honestly, this place beat our expectations! The guac was fresh, good consistency, and had plenty of cilantro. The appetizers we ordered (several dips, and the chorizo-cheese plate - forget the name) were all well-prepared, uniquely seasoned, and great. The margarita was stiff and sweet, probably came from a mix, but not outrageously priced. Our sever was Ando and he was really pleasant and eager to help! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is fantastic! We've been here numerous times, and I've only had a mediocre dish one time."}
{"text":"The Monroeville Patron is one of my favorite mexican restaurants when visiting the area.  The service is great.The chicken burritos are delicious.  The chicken is flavorful and juicy. I usually do not enjoy the rice and beans at other restaurants but these were probably my favorite. The restaurant is clean and atmosphere is pleasant. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The chips and Salsa are so good.  It is easy to fill up on these - so be mindful to only stick to one basket of chips  : )   You will want to save room for the entree!l  but of course - if you are like me, this advice will go un-heeded, and you will polish off three (maybe four) baskets of chips before your entree even is a thought in your head!  And the beautiful thing - the wait-staff just smiles and brings another basket and another bowl of that fine salsa!  Oh, and I always get the enchiladas as they are fantastic."}
{"text":"AWWW YEAHHH.. this place is my go to mexican restaurant! SUCH delicious food, from the chips and salsa to the drinks to the food! I honestly can't believe the negative reviews, and I think they're incorrect. I've gone here MANY times and NEVER had a complaint. For instance, 'I don't like rice or beans'... thennn don't go to a mexican restaurant. Definitely go to this Patron in particular, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends for the $1 tacos special on Monday. Don't be misled, the special only applies to hard shell tacos so if you're not a fan of that, maybe this isn't for you. They also only come in two options, beef or chicken. There was nothing exceptional about either, but I definitely liked the beef one more than the chicken one. In terms of size, the tacos were not smaller just because of the price (as my friend feared). They were reasonable servings and I'd say 3 is good for a meal (unless you're starving).   The interior is really well-decorated and not something you would expect based on the restaurant exterior. There also wasn't that big of a crowd for the $1 special. Overall, I'm a fan of the $1 deal but not so much for the actual tacos.."}
{"text":"Our third visit to this classic Mexican restaurant in Monroeville.  Although we often go to MadMax 'cause I love the fish tacos and margaritas, tonight we wanted classic Mexican fare, and the atmosphere and decor seems fun in Patron.  I decided on the Enchiladas Mexicanos (I believe, since I'm still a bit upset by the experience). I asked for a bean enchilada and two cheese enchiladas with onions, further specifying I wanted the onions inside.  The Asian (since I did not get his name this is my only way to identify him for you) bartender/waiter seemed put off about the onions inside the enchiladas.  Why, I thought, as I've gotten onion and cheese enchiladas lots and lots of times in other Mexican restaurants.  When our bartender brought the order he said 'This is the last time you can ever order these like this again!  The cook said it was really, really hard and he'll never make it again'.  The he muttered 'he was really mad.'  I was shocked and humiliated.  I was scolded for what I ordered and for what reason?  Didn't he know such a statement would most likely keep me from ever coming back?  My husband and I just looked at each other and said 'what was that?\"  I decided to keep my mouth shut since the Pirates were winning on the Root channel and the salsa was good enough.  As I dig into my enchiladas I discover the two (oh, so difficult to make onion and cheese enchiladas) were in fact just a couple corn tortillas wrapped around a couple slices of onions.  That did it.  When our very missing bartender finally returned, I sort of lost it.  I confronted him about scolding me and low and behold look how difficult these were to make I pointed to him on the plate!  No Cheese even!  He told me to 'calm down' and I said how dare you, after the scolding you gave me about how tough the enchiladas were to make......The manager came out and I told him about it.  He was nice, and removed my meal from our check, but it was too little too late."}
{"text":"I had the steak tacos.  They were flavorful.  I haven't tried enough of the menu to properly give more insight.  I mainly wanted to review it because of the rude valet out front.  I couldn't find self parking around so I opted for their valet.  Normally, I would walk rather than pay someone to move my car.  On the valet sign there was no price for the service.  I assumed that it was complimentary and would give a tip.  Well, I got my car, gave what I thought was a decent tip, and was told there is a flat rate.  Luckily, I had just the right amount of cash for the rate, but no extra for the tip.   I could have pulled up, put on my flashers, and made change for them.  I decided not to do this after his reaction to me being unaware there was a flat rate (even though it wasn't on the sign...) He gave attitude to his coworker about me, right in front of me!    It was incredibly rude, unprofessional, and left a bad taste in my mouth, regardless of the good food I just consumed.  I gave 4 stars because Patron's food, decor, and service deserved it.  The valets would get 1 star, simply because they returned my car unharmed."}
{"text":"We eat (and drink!) there all the time. The staff and food are excellent! If you want food that's authentic, go to Patrons!"}
{"text":"We ended up here early Saturday evening. The restaurant was very busy and more people pouring in the door. We were showed to our table very quickly and placed our order within 5 minutes of arriving.  The service was very good and the prices were more than reasonable.  The food was average but presented in a attractive manor. Overall I would say this is a solid Mexican choice, maybe not the best food but definitely good."}
{"text":"Ahhh! I am so excited to have finally gotten to try this place. I went with a friend for lunch on Sunday afternoon and was blown away.   The service was AMAZING, the food was delicious, great atmosphere, refreshing (and dangerous!) margaritas - all of my favorite things!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Only been there one time but the chicken enchiladas were great.  When I'm in the mood for Mexican I'm going here or to Mad Mex."}
{"text":"BEST (only?) MEXICAN IN PITTSBURGH (I feel confident in saying this because I'm not aware of any other authentic Mexican restaurants in the city.)  We've been eating at Patron's since it opened at this location.  Raul, Alicia, Oscar and the entire staff do an amazing job of treating their guests right and serving delicious food.  Much better than Tex-American-Mexican wanna be's like Mad Max.  Much less LOUD too.     We've gone on date-nights, with friends, with our kids - and it's been great each time.  As I've told my friends, I'm not that crazy about Mexican food in general.  I grew up in the South and true Mexican restaurants there are numerous.  But not only does Patron serve great food, the atmosphere is casual & fun and the wait-staff are attentive and exceptional.  We budget for eating out and wouldn't waste these unique times on anywhere that didn't hit all the targets.  Patron Restaurant we return to again and again.  YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time on a Friday night with our 3 kids, and were happy to get a table right away!  The food was much better than some other mexican restaurants we've tried - seemed more authentic.  Kids menu was good.  I tried the Sangria which was tasty!  Overall, we were happy with our waitress, dinners, and will come back again."}
{"text":"The food is 4 stars. I'm not going to get all up in arms and pretend I can tell that they don't serve \"REAL\" mexican food here. Every meal I've had here has been enjoyable. The atompshere is fun. Definitely a one of a kind place in this area. I almost bumped this place to 5 stars because of the unbelievable service. You are never waiting on anything even when it's extremely busy. It's a top notch service staff here for sure. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I've been to Patron Mexican Grill at least ten times and I would say that the overall experience is great with a few minor problems. I'd say that the decor and atmosphere is really what makes this place special, the bathrooms are very clean too. The dining area is vibrant and exciting, though it can get loud at times. Service there is generally really fast and spot on but expect a decent wait on weekends. I really wish the food was just a bit better, it's not bad but it doesn't really have that \"WOW\" factor."}
{"text":"Parking is a train wreak Salsa is beyond disappointing. I've had better store bought. Bland. No taste. Just not good. Chorizo is actually fairly decent but the fries are just ok.  The noise level on just on the favorable side of an earthquake. If you want to have a quiet meal with your loved one go elsewhere.  The bar is tiny and, like the rest of the place so loud you can't think Prices seem fair. Worryingly the only condiments on the table are the typical Pittsburgh spice cabinet. Salt, pepper, sugar, pink, and yellow.  I ordered the fiestas Aztec and the pork was unappealing balls of gray, the steak was tough and way overdone, the chicken was just fine though."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way back Michigan because of the prior Yelp reviews! We got there slightly after 9:30pm on a Monday night and the place was jumping! Kevin (the waiter) took great care of us! He will make sure your drinks are full and you are satisfied with your meals! The food was great!"}
{"text":"I went for lunch with my hubby A day ago and received the chimichanga lunch special and it was so good! The drinks are a little over priced but food is more than enough"}
{"text":"I was born in raised in Chicago, a town with a much larger Hispanic population, and I've been complaining since I moved to Monroeville 5 years ago that there really isn't much good Latin food in the area.  Patron was the answer to my dreams.  I don't know why so many people are complaining about the bright colors or the race of the wait staff.  The reason for the non-Hispanic majority of wait staff is most likely since these guys this new restaurant on the other side of Pittsburgh, but still run the original place in Wexford.  Just because they opened a new restaurant doesn't mean that they spontaneously multiply their numbers.  As for the decor, if you're not into the bright colors, I suggest you never travel to the southwest, or for that matter Mexico.  My family has been to Mexico numerous times, and this place is about as authentic as you can get.  I forget the name of the province that the chef is from, but it is somewhere near Cabo San Lucas (baja california), and they're actually known for their tasty cuisine.  My wife and I go into Patron at least once a week, and I've managed to try many different items off the menu.  I think their tamales are just as good as the ones I used to get from my good friend's grandmother every Christmas.  They most certainly will let you substitute rice for beans or vice versa, but I recommend both.  For those that measure a Mexican restaurant by a burrito, I suggest you read up on the origin of that food.  It is an American invention, so it's the last thing I'd use to judge a place.  The Chile Relleno is great, as are the enchiladas with red sauce.  Something I had never heard of, but thoroughly enjoy is the Chipotle Chicken.  Oh, and be sure to check out their specialty Fajitas, some have chorizo & carnitas, and are wonderful!  If you want real authentic Mexican cuisine, go to Patron.  If you're looking for a giant burrito and the simple standard yinzer fajitas, go to Don Pablo's."}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience here. The food is delicious, the service is good, and everything comes pretty quickly. I always walk out with wonderful leftovers too."}
{"text":"I had lunch at a Patron in Monroeville last year, which I really enjoyed, so I thought I'd give this one a try. The one in Monroeville was definitely better, but this one was alright. The waitress was very friendly and recommended the 2 for $25, which included an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. With 3 drinks, a kids meal, and the tip we ended up paying about $48. The chips were not very fresh, but the queso we got as an appetizer was very tasty. My wife and I both got the enchiladas, which were very traditional; nothing to write home about. The best part of the meal was the dessert: fruit-filled churros with ice cream....Oh, one cool thing about the restaurant was all the pictures of famous people on the wall, including a bunch of Steelers players and staff. So, if you do decide to try it out, you will be in very famous company."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and everything had excellent flavor. The portions were enormous and the customer service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"We had heard great reviews of this place, and so my husband chose Patron as the place to celebrate his birthday.  Sadly, the 45 minute drive ended in nothing but disappointment. Our waiter appeared bored and disinterested the moment that we arrived. He brought drinks with no comment then silently returned with more chips (he was at least attentive). We thought that since the restaurant was empty (the Steelers were playing) that we would get good service. My daughters informed the hostess that we were celebrating my husband's birthday and she told them \"I got you.\" However, after the waiter silently and sullenly delivered the check, we sat at the table for 20 minutes with nary a Happy Birthday to be heard or sung.  I am giving 2 stars because the quality of the food was very good. But we left this restaurant feeling like we were a pain in the waiter's rear and we bothered him by bringing our business to Patron. This will be our lasting impression of Patron, rather than the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Food tastes great to me! In comparison to the phony wanna-be Mexican restaurant that resides across the street, this place is delicious. fairly priced, hot food everytime, helpful staff, delicious drinks! Loved it from the apps to the desserts."}
{"text":"I've been here before and it is the same food as before but the prices are much higher than they used to be. The kids meal prices are insane for what you get. They are no different than el campesino. The rice isn't good at all barely any vegetables in it and it is extremly overcooked and bland. I will not be back and the people who are saying the food is so great must get drunk first.  Also you have to sit and listen to people who love theirselves so much and are extremely loud about it."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and got delivered quickly, so their back of house staff is clearly on point. The front of house staff, however, was abysmal. I went with one friend and we were served by two people, neither of whom returned to the table more than once. We ended up being there for close to two hours, while the dining room was nearly empty, and we had to ask another server to take care of our checks. For the first hour, we had a fine experience. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Not really a big fan of Mexican cuisine, but tonight I had a great experience. The food selection was extensive and different than what I'm accustomed to eating. Great staff, when I entered I felt welcomed and never unnoticed. The food was delicious leaving me wanting more to take home for later LOL. My wife had a Margarita and was more than satisfied with her drink. The only problem that I came across was the choice of only Ranch salad dressing. Overall one of the better experiences that I've enjoyed, not only for Mexican cuisine but food all together. I will return and maybe become a regular PATRON. (Pun definitely intended)"}
{"text":"I gave Patron 4 stars but you have to keep in mind the context- Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. Not exactly teeming with Hispanic people altogether. That being said, if you come there with that mindset, they offer reasonably priced tex-mex with phenomenal service. If there were other good authentic Mexican options in the region, I would probably rate this closer to 3.5 stars just based on food quality/authenticity.   Ambience: Classic tex-mex decor with overly flamboyant colors, seats with desert scenery painted on. There's something about the overdone cheesy style that I liked. They have plenty of seating for large groups and seem fairly accommodating. Only most nights there's a reasonable buzz such that it's busy but not too loud. The restaurant is most ideal for groups, family (with kids is perfect) and friends.   Food: I wouldn't say the food is great but it's not bad. Most of the dishes are traditional tex-mex dishes: enchiladas, burritos, tacos with sides of refried beans and Mexican rice. Again, executed well but nothing unique by any means. The key is everything is reasonably priced in my opinion and the chips and salsa service is phenomenal. I can't think of one time I have been there and waited more than 20 seconds to get a basket of tortilla chips and fresh salsa. To me, sometimes just those small things matter. Oh and the extra bonus of the Monday night special: $1 tacos (which have some scrumptious, likely extra creamy shredded cheese).   Drinks: Not much on tap except the usual domestics and Mexican beers. Their margaritas, like the food, are nothing unique but are satisfying. This is especially true on Monday nights (yes, coupled with the tacos, it's the best daily special!)- $3 margaritas. I will say they are plenty generous on the juice- one margarita packs a pretty boozy punch.   Service: Along with consistent food, this restaurant location has consistent service. Quite frankly it's one of the best restaurants in the area in regards to service. Chips and salsa on the table within a minute from seating. Quick service throughout the night and extra friendly. In only a few visits there's one waiter who always will come by and say hi to us, even if he isn't serving us. That's impressive and sells the family-friendly environment. Big plus here for that and probably the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of a lower rating."}
{"text":"I had an amazing meal there. The drinks were on point and so was the staff. Instead of going to the McDonald's next door stop in here . I see a lot of reviews on here about pricing and I can say personalIty I think its perfect pricing for the serving size you get. I took so much chicken home from my fajitas I made two more for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place. The food is delicious and the servers are very friendly. The prices are reasonable and we've never had a bad experience there yet. Great margaritas as well!"}
{"text":"Being a native Texan, there are times you just want some \"home\" cooked food. We have really enjoyed coming to this place since it opened - the decor inside and out is really fun, and the service is always top notch.  Of course, you get free chips & salsa probably within 30 seconds of sitting down - salsa isn't really spicy but is good. The prices are very decent and the quality and portions provided are good. I am always getting their combo which includes rice and beans and a selection of the traditional items (chalupa, taco, enchilada, burrito, etc.).   We have probably been 3 times in the last year and never had to wait, always had very fast service (I think this last time, they served our dinner 10 minutes after placing the order and we were leaving in under 45 mins!!!), and the only issues we have had were that one time they had a really bad, stale batch of chips, and if the place is full, it can get REALLY loud as it is a tight space with low ceilings and occasionally can result in difficult conversations.  Howeve, overall if I want to get my Mexican fix, this is where I go."}
{"text":"Make it a night to remember at Pittsburgh's hottest Gay and Mexican Restaurant! Located in the heart of Gay East Liberty, this restaurant is THE place to bring the whole crew. Buy your boyfriends a pitcher of sangria and then make them all jealous when you make a new friend at the bar.   Spice it up with some of Patron's famous Gay Carne Asada!"}
{"text":"This is exactly what I needed. Nothing fancy, just a menu full of tortillas with cheese meat and vegetables.   Delicious queso, delicious Mexican restaurant chips (my favorite), delicious typical American-Mexican food. Fairytale.   The prices are a little higher than I'd like, and the margarita pitcher was a little weak. But I know we will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. All Good!  I had enchiladas Mexicanos and my wife had carnitas. Both were good picks."}
{"text":"Monday nights are the only nights I go and I always have a great time. Monday's are $1 taco and $3 margaritas night - my favorite! The tacos are delicious and always come out quickly, plus the margaritas are a little stronger than other places nearby. There's never a long wait for tables, either. Overall it's a fun place to go after work. The main reason why I don't go on other days of the week is because I feel the normal priced entrees are expensive. Not necessarily expensive for the neighborhood, just expensive for Mexican food."}
{"text":"The decor certainly smacks you in the face when you enter the door. One of the better attributes is their ability to get you in and out during the lunch rush - even with a large group.  Their menu is comparable to Emiliano's in terms of style and variety but they pale in comparison from a quality standpoint.  Chips and salsa are OK. Overall, not a bad choice just far from my go-to in the region."}
{"text":"A challenger (not yet the winner) in the East of Pittsburgh for Mexican Restaurant Dominance!  Hubby and I tried it out - decor is BRIGHT and LOUD - interesting at best. Margaritas were large and expensive but well done. Had a appetizer sampler platter and was just OK.   We both had the carnitas and it was just OK.   The greater discussion is - does Monroeville need another Mexican restaurant? I've had better food at El Campasino BUT Patron is trying to make more ambiance which El Campasino lacks. You've got chains like Don Pablos and Mad Mex and I'd venture to say their food is probably more consistent than Patron.  It's a toss up so verdict: I'd be willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here at 5 on a Sunday night when we were trying to use a Darden Restaurants (Olive Garden, Red Lobster) gift card that we had received, but found that all of those restaurants in Monroeville had an hour wait! Why anyone would wait so long to eat somewhere lacking in character, when this place was directly across the street, with ample open seating, was beyond me!  The relative early timing of our visit meant that Happy Hour pricing on margaritas was in effect. They were $3.50 and STRONG, great for washing down the spicy salsa that came with the chips. Service was attentive and the food was good. I got a chimichanga and my husband got the vegetarian fajitas. All tasty, well spiced, and in very filling portions.  The TVs were not a big distraction for us. There were mostly families there eating, and we didn't observe a gross, sports-bar-esque atmosphere (which tends to annoy us very much as well). It's all in the timing, I guess, but we had a fine time, enjoying the kitschy decor on a grey winter day."}
{"text":"I love Patron's.  The atmosphere is great and the food even better.  I have tried so many things on the menu and loved each and every one.  The salsa and chips given at the beginning of the visit is a big plus. The margaritas are also amazing!!!  The only thing that can use a little improvement is more attention from the servers."}
{"text":"On a Friday night, right after the release of a coupon on LivingSocial, Patron Mexican Grill was extremely busy. We waited about half an hour for a table and an hour for our food, which is to be expected given the situation. Overall, the food here was good Mexican food for Pittsburgh, but the quality really doesn't compare at all to other parts of the country. We chose Mexican restaurant basics and found the flavor and consistency of the food adequate but not great.  The one shining spot of the restaurant also equated to its greatest downfall: while the waiter was extremely helpful in asking about whether or not dishes on the \"Vegetarian\" menu were actually vegetarian, the chef told him that all of the dishes are cooked with chicken stock. Thus, none of the dishes listed on the \"Vegetarian\" menu are actually vegetarian. While this is typical at many Mexican restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, there are some choices for which this is not the case.  Overall, the restaurant was decent and the service was good. However, this is simply an above average choice for authentic Mexican food in Pittsburgh. For the best, try Jose Ole out near Robinson: the food is the most authentic you can come by in the area and the dishes on the vegetarian menu (with the exception of the rice) are actually vegetarian."}
{"text":"Love the seasoned ground meat and guacamole at patrons! I had the chimichanga (beef) it was delicious but I expected it to be bigger for $14.00 geez.  The food does come fast at this restaurant.. you don't keep you waiting .. really like that. I love the guac !   We were seated at a two seater booth and it was so dark that I had to use my iphone flashlight in order to read the menu..  The food came fast but its an expense meal no doubt. The new outside deck is real nice and a nice addition to the restaurant.    Arriba ! Arriba !"}
{"text":"Chimichanga was great. Large portions, good service and great unlimited chips and salsa."}
{"text":"We got takeout and it was low quality Mexican.  Chicken was stringy and tough, seasonings were very pedestrian. If you like this you're not serious about Mexican."}
{"text":"Great place for mexican food awesome decore and extremly friendly service. I ordered amigo pollo for lunch and didnt look like much but when i was done i felt comfortably full. My wife ordered the toco saled it was bland with cheese souse ar the bottem of the toco. We even had there fried ice cream and i cant wait to have it again. We will definitly be dining there again."}
{"text":"I have loved Patron's for years and never had a less than 5 star meal until now.  My initial concern began when I looked around and saw predominately Caucasian employees. In the past this was not the case. Our server did a very good job and we had no complaints with her at all. The food though was a huge disappointment. The cheese dip and chipotle cheese dip were really runny and cold. The filling inside the beef chimichanga was bland. The pico de gallo was soupy and left a puddle of liquid on the plate. My daughters chalupa was buried under so much lettuce and guac that she looked and didn't see it and had to double check. The entire meal was bland, runny, not crisp as it should have been.  I don't know what happened to the flavor and quality of food that I grew to love. I will be looking elsewhere for my next Mexican food fix. Certainly NOT worth the money spent this time."}
{"text":"Sadly our festivities were spoiled last night! Placed in the bar and thought \"how fun, party spot\"! But that soon faded. We ordered beverages and were told at 6:18 p.m. they were unable to provide frozen margaritas! So we went with the flow and had on the rocks. After we received our drinks, placed our order I asked for extra napkins and was told by the male sever (yeah he never said his name) for extra napkins he told us it is Cinco de mayo and he was too busy! We shrugged it off but then when we ordered another round we NEVER received them. I ordered a steak dish and received chicken. Since we seriously couldn't find the server I picked at it. Then we had to find a manager to get a takeout box and our check. Sure enough we were charged for the second round of drinks, had to get the manager again who never offered anything, just said \"well it is Cinco\". Our check was $60 and we had to go to the takeout area to try and pay our bill. We were excited for a great time but wished we had gone to Emiliano's instead. Lessons learned. Shame on the manager for not making things right and blowing off 3 paying regular customers. Never again. Looking forward to the new Emiliano's in McCandless! I wish folks would start to boycott places like this, the spoiled what should have been a BLAST!"}
{"text":"Patron is pretty decent. Their service can be a little slow at times but not too bad. The only issue I had at Patron was when one time me and my friend went to one of their $1 taco nights on Mondays and they said that there would be a 45 minute wait to get a table even though the restaurant was half-empty. Other than that, every time I have gone has been lovely. The staff is super friendly and helpful. I especially like their $1 tacos and $3 margaritas on Mondays!"}
{"text":"Since this restaurant opened I have eaten here many times, but only once within the last year. Early on the food was very good. Today, the meal was one of the worst I have ever experienced.  Margaritas before dinner should have been the tip off. We ordered premium tequila with only triple sec and roses's lime. Bartender insisted he knew what we wanted, but when our drinks came they were 12 ounces of God know's what. Tasted like coconut. We sent back and settled for wine. We ordered the Carnitas Dinner and Fajita Astec. Both meals were cold and reheated ( apparently several times). The fajita plate was all mixed together. It was obvious that the plate was heated with the vegetables only an then the left over meats were added. There are too many good Mexican restaurants in the North Hills to ever go to this place again."}
{"text":"Good spot in the north hills for Mexican food.  Obviously this is Pittsburgh so you're not gonna get the most authentic Mexican food but it definitely satisfies the cravings.  I came here with a party of 6 and we all could barely walk after devouring the complimentary chips/salsa and our meals.  We ordered a bunch of things including tacos, gorditas, and fajjita platters.  Everyone enjoyed their meals and there was no complaints.  Definitely will be back; most likely to try their $1 tacos/$3 margs on Mondays 5-close."}
{"text":"Got takeout and all went well. Shrimp and chicken over rice was good. Came w chips and salsa. Reasonable prices. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"I am at odds with this review as Patron delivers quality service and food, yet the atmosphere and facilities can really alter your experience. Typical mexican food, great monday dollar taco special and genuine service all the way up to the management. Unfortunately, parking is a disaster. The bar has maybe 20 seats available in it, which doesn't leave you much of a window to get into. Very noisy and active, banging buckets as hand drums for people's birthdays. I won't credit the restaurant for being crowded due to what they are producing, it is a very open/intimate table set up. You might find yourself at a table that is directly next to someone, seated at an intersection in the middle of a crowded restaurant.   Take the time if you enter Patron to check out the facilities before you sit down. I'm sure this place is not for everyone."}
{"text":"You know, I keep giving this place a shot.  Every single time I go I'm disappointed.  I used to think that I was maybe ordering the wrong thing, but after like 4 \"wrong things\" in a row I'm done throwing money away.  I once had a vegetarian fajita that came with carrot coins.  Like the frozen kind.  For $14.  I'm currently eating $11 carne asada tacos that consisted of three sad little tacos with overlooked meat, no rice or beans on the side, and nothing but some really crazy overly potent hot sauce. So basically after drink and a tip i spent $17 on three of the tiniest worst tacos I've ever had in my life. Maybe it is just me, everything my dining partners are currently eating looks pretty good but I'm just sitting here staring at them because I finished my limp tacos in about 2 bites and two minutes.  Who knows, maybe I'm consistently ordering the wrong thing, but I never seem to have that problem anywhere else."}
{"text":"I like the fish tacos and have ordered them several times before. But today I stopped by to place an order and was completely ignored. The person at the front desk just kept speaking Spanish to someone who worked there and never made eye contact. I left without ordering."}
{"text":"I normally love Patron. Huge advocate. But this recent visit has me questioning what happened. The food was good but the service has dropped suddenly. My waitress never came to the table once to get refills. Like WHAT THE HECK! I live for liquids! Why did you not once come to the table to see how you table was doing! I literally sat at my table and watched the waitress play on her phone while I was dying of thirst. Normally the service is great but this shouldn't go unnoticed. I call earlier before my visit to ask if it was \".99 cent\" taco night and the response I go was \"no they're a dollar\" like 1.00. Not a big deal but what's the difference?! I think this lady needs to go so my heart can give it 5 stars again. R.I.P OG Patron"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this place. The decor is absolutely beautiful, but the tacos are decent. This location is larger than it looks from the outside; there are quite a few different sections of seating. Therefor it's perfect for large groups. We went here for dollar taco night and happy hour. Only the hard shell tacos are $1. I don't like hard shell so I got soft and paid $2.50 each. The flavor was pretty bland, and one of my tacos had a chunk of meat that was not cooked all the way through. My friends come here a lot so I'm sure that I'll be back hopefully trying something different and tasty."}
{"text":"For my FIRST review of a Pittsburgh restaurant, I'm choosing Patron's. It is absolutely the BEST Mexican food in the city! I have tried a lot of things on the menu, and everything I've tried has been delicious! It's far from my house, but it's worth the drive! I have friends that live an hour away from the restaurant and they eat there every weekend. It's just that good. When it's someone in my family's birthday and they choose a place to go to dinner, everyone ALWAYS chooses Patron's. They celebrate your birthday by banging lots of pots and pans and blowing horns, it's a great time! They also sing and give you a dessert to share. It's a very affordable place to eat and is sure to be a favorite!  My typical meal is the Chicken Chimichungas, taquito appetizer, and the chips with Queso sauce! YUMMMMM!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is not a good example of Mexican food.   First of all, they don't make their own tortillas - major fail. That's one of the main reasons to go to a Mexican restaurant instead of just making the food at home.  The Gorditas de Pastor were a let down. It was not served with grilled pineapple like the menu stated nor was a lime provided. For anyone who knows their pastor, you understand the atrocity here. These two simple ingredients are what push pastor into the foodgasm realm. They are key and leaving them out is blasphemous. Strike 2.  Everything was bland and lacked capsaicin in a discernible amount, so naturally I asked for some jalapeños (listed on the menu as raw or pickled for $1). The waitress asked me if I wanted them raw or fried - I was totally confused, but whatever, so I said raw. She brought me pickled jalapeños - lol. C'mon now! I thought this was a Mexican restaurant! They don't even know the difference between raw and pickled jalapeños?! Strike 3.  The food was not bad, it just wasn't good."}
{"text":"This place has the best chips and salsa and chicken quesadillas! It's a must have every time I go! The service is always great and very quick!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. Both times were excellent. The service was efficient and courteous. The queso and chile rellenos were great. Carnitas were also outstanding.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food I have ever had but by far not the worst.  It is an interesting little place that makes me feel as if I am in an open air style restaurant in Mexico.  The food is well portioned to the price and has good flavor.  Will agree with others that the host station always seems a bit rushed and put off when you come in, however the wait staff  is top notch.  Never had a bad experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We frequent patrons however we avoid this location at ALL COSTS!!! It's always something, stale chips, bad service, wrong food, and NOW apparently they don't use Nowait anymore however they are still are on the app. Always disappointed. Go to the highland park location. Management there knows what's up.   Also, when I spoke with someone about the nowait app he just proceeded to stay silent on the phone for over 20 seconds. It was unprofessional and I eventually hung up because he wasn't answering me."}
{"text":"Been several times, and each time the food has been on point.  In my opinion, it's the most authentic Mexican food in the area.  Salsa is fresh and the guac is smooth and nutty.  Being from California, we know good Mexican food, and Patron ranks up there with some of our SoCal favorites."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian fajitas!! My girlfriend and I are vegan and they quickly and easily accommodated us. The decorations are adorable with hand painted murals on everything! The waitor was quick and the portions were huge!  We brought home left overs with chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Although there is not a whole lot that makes Patron's unique from other Mexican restaurants in the area, the service was incredibly fast. The server was friendly and polite, and the enchiladas were pretty good. We did have children in our party, and they seemed to enjoy the food, too. If you're looking for a family-friendly environment and a lower price point, Patron's is a good choice."}
{"text":"Patron Mexican grill is a popular destination for Mexican food if you want bang for your buck. Our group got the patron fajita and the Aztec fajita. Both tasted quite similar but good and well seasoned. However, the meat was a little over cooked. The Aztec fajita has a copious amount of meat and I would recommend ordering this in groups of two or three people.  TLDR: good bang for your buck, especially the Aztec fajita."}
{"text":"The worst mexican food i ever tasted. The beef tacos where flavorless. I ordered some dish that was to be beef with onions and peppers and deep fried. It came out very greasy with no beef inside just soggy onions. This is the worst place ever. People please do not waste your money. This place sucks and the queso is horrible. The sevice sucks as well. The tacos at taco bell taste better than this place. What a disappointment to REAL mexican food."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican grille. Friendly service, cool atmosphere, cool decor, extensive menu, affordable prices. No real differentiators from comparable Mexican restaurants. Location is convenient for Wexford area residents. Accessible from 19, 910, or 79."}
{"text":"Being a first generation Mexican-American, I know the difference between authentic, Tex-Mex, and make-believe (like Taco Bell) mexican food. Unfortunately, only the ambience at Patron Mexican Grill (furniture and background music) had any Mexican flavor. While the quality of the food was fairly decent, it was bland and in no way representative of  Mexican food.  Good Mexican food is flavorful (without being  necessarily hot). The Salsa accompanying the chips was flavorless canned tomato with very little and unidentifiable seasoning. The chips were warm, but unsalted. My GF had fish (Tilapia) tacos served with finely chopped coleslaw and a strange vinegar based tartar-like sauce. She had asked our server if the meal included rice and beans and was told yes. This was not the case.  I ordered the Steak Mexicano, which was a decent but under-seasoned bone-in rib steak smothered in sautéed bell peppers and onions, accompanied with ok rice and beans. Again, decent food, but definitely not identifiable as Mexican cuisine.  After the food was delivered, no one ever came back to check if our orders were satisfactory. I had to flag down a server from another table to ask for some hot sauce. He quickly brought me two bottles of Habanero sauce, one hot green, the other brownish yellow xxx hot. Apparently the options are to suffer with bland tasteless food, or destroy your taste buds with ridiculous heat. Nothing in between. The positives in the experience were the cheerful ambience, and the friendly and hardworking wait staff. The food, not so much.  We will continue our quest elsewhere to find out whether the Pittsburgh area has a decent Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of mexican food, in general, but this is one that I really enjoyed. I had the chicken quesadilla and liked it a lot. The grilled chicken in it was delicious, i could eat an entire plate of it alone."}
{"text":"Love this place! I crave their food - especially the chicken taco salad - the outer shell is crispy and everything you want it to be. My favorite queso in town! You will not be disappointed by portions. Decoration detailed and amazing"}
{"text":"Nothing special . The place is loud and all the workers seem uninterested and oblivious to customers. Missing meals and super slow is what you should expect."}
{"text":"The place was good but the service was not that good and they did not even have enough menus for 3 people and the got all there menus that they had and gave them to a party of 9. And those people were so slow. Once we finally got are menus we got are food and drinks and they were pretty good and we were lucky enough to get a parking yes."}
{"text":"2/22/2016, national margarita day - let me preface this review by saying that I've been to Patron multiple times without any issue.   I get it, the place was packed. My friend and I requested a table for two at around 9:30 PM. While we were being seated, we noticed a group of friends sitting nearby and went to chat. After being encouraged to sit down (where there was easily enough room for two others) we did.   The waitress that came by could not be more hostile. Immediately stating that no additional orders were being taken, but that we could \"go to the bar yourself and grab a drink\"  After my friend and I grabbed drinks (quite easily I may add, as if they weren't actually as backed up as she claimed) we sat back at the table and resumed chatting with our friends.   At one point, the waitress happens to walk by, checking in on everyone and grabbing empty plates. She bumps my margarita glass accidentally, to which I joked 'what if she did that on purpose'. Well, she turns around to state, \"if I wanted to, I wouldn't have bumped your glass, I would've taken the whole thing and dumped it over your head\" to which I laughed hysterically.   She also stated \"once you finish your drinks, you need to leave this table. My manager has my back\" FALSE!  Her manager came over a few minutes later to ensure everything was alright and apologize that we were not served.   Listen I get it, it's a busy time, we didn't behave as the ideal customers by sitting with friends we saw instead of the table they had assigned us, but some of these statements were straight out of a Server Training Video titled, \"what not to say to customers, no matter how terrible your night\"  What an awful experience from what used to be one of my favorite spots for casual Mexican food. Unfortunately, 0 stars is not an option.   I'd recommend firing this waitress (don't recall her name, not that I cared, but she'd be the one you saw and thought 'yea, she's too old to be a waitress at a Mexican chain'), but I doubt she's qualified to obtain work anywhere else. Definitely not with that attitude."}
{"text":"I tried Patron's for dinner a few nights ago, out of curiosity. Entrees were very good - I had shrimp fajitas and my husband had carnitas - tasty and large portions. However, I have to agree with some of the other comments that the guacamole was sub-par. I don't think it was a matter of freshness, it was just bland. We also had a pitcher of margaritas that was pretty bad - tasted like limeaide. I don't want to give a bad review because the main courses were great and the staff was super nice, but if you're going to claim to be a Mexican restaurant you've got to get the guacamole and margaritas right! Hopefully it'll improve in these areas - if so, I'd give it another try."}
{"text":"Everyone has raved about this restaurant. I know Monday is the busiest day. It is 1 dollar tacos and 4 dollar house margs , so we were expecting to wait some.  However, it took 15 minutes for us to order drinks then it took about 20 minutes to get them. That's not bad at all; honestly, we were ready to order and our waiter said hold on. He was gone for 30 minutes and finally came back to take our order.   Other people who were seated after us, were already eating their food which was really frustrating.  We just requested the check and that was the fastest part of our experience . Honestly we will come back but only because we heard the food is good . The service was terrible today."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are my favorites here. I got the chicken street tacos, and they were very good."}
{"text":"Late lunch the day after Christmas. Ordered ala carte soft chix taco, beef enchilada & refried beans. Decent but not flavorful enough. The queso blanco cheese is very salty so if you serve it without vegetables or salsa or something to cut it, it tends to overpower the dishes.  The liberal use of queso blanco is reminiscent of El Campesino.  GF ordered fajita chix salad w extra guac. Again, decent but a little bland. Guac was limey and flavorful.  Free basket of chips/salsa was very good too.   Service was really good.   Ladies room was one of most disgusting I've seen in a restaurant. They need to clean really well - including the walls & fix toilet leaks.GROSS!"}
{"text":"If this wasn't in Wexford it wouldn't get four stars but it's worlds better than other Mexican restaurants around these parts. Their queso was so good and so was the salsa. Service was quick and all of the staff was so polite. Very good spot for some classic Mexican dishes."}
{"text":"We just moved here from Dallas and were looking for Mexican food. All seven of us loved our meals and satisfied our Tex/Mex cravings. The portions were large and the food was quite savory.  The fajita taco salad that I had was one of the best I've ever had. We'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"Fast service and good food.  Love the nachos and salsa dip their portion sizes are generous also. Not the highest quality of food but also not expensive."}
{"text":"okay, I'll admit that my first choice in food is absolutely not Mexican.  However, as Mexican places go, this place is okay.  Nothing fancy, nothing special -- food is good and fairly authentic (as authentic as you'll find in Pittsburgh).  The 4 or 5 times I've been there the service was a little slow -- otherwise I would have given 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and  interesting bathrooms.  Overall I give the food 7.3 out of 10 the atmosphere 8.5 and the bathroom a 10.  I would come back!"}
{"text":"I've only ever come on Mondays for their Happy Hour $1 tacos and $3 lime margaritas. I'm not a fan of hard shell tacos, but who's complaining...they're $1/each! My favourite was definitely the chicken!   For some reason my lime margaritas tasted like tequila and old feet...? Not that I've ever tasted old feet before. Still got 2 margaritas because hey, they're only $3 right? Oh yeah, when you sit down they also give you free salsa and tortilla chips which is a great bonus!"}
{"text":"Awful bland food is all this place serves up.  The drinks are decent and the service was good but I can't overlook the terrible food.  I've tried many other Mexican places in the area and this is my least favorite."}
{"text":"The mole sucked, the burrito sucked, and the service was average at best.  I don't understand how this place has multiple locations.  I went once to this one and once to the Wexford one.  I will never go back. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 4:30p for an early dinner. The restaurant is very clean and there was lots of natural light which was nice. They also had a soccer match on a big screen which my BF enjoyed.   Our server was very nice and prompt. He answered all of our questions and brought everything without delay. They give free chips and salsa which is nice but pretty standard for a Mexican restaurant. We also ordered the queso, which is no-frills but delicious. Our waiting was quick on refilling our chips.   BF had one of the combo platters which was HUGE and tasty but not something to write home about. I had the three chicken tacos. At $5, it was a great deal. The tacos were good but the shredded iceburg lettuce made them a bit watery. I liked the cheese that was on them and it was plentiful. The flavor of the chicken was also good.   We didn't have drinks so I can't comment on that. The cocktails looked large from what I saw at other tables.   Overall a good meal, and reasonably priced. I'll stick with my local place but Patron was nice in a pinch."}
{"text":"Ok this place is \"on point\" the ambiance is super cute and colorful, the service was friendly and responsive :) now lets talk about the food. We just moved here from SoCal so we know good mexican food. We ordered the 3 dips...queso..guac..& bean dip and they were all great. My husband had enchiladas suizas & I did the pick 2 with a chicken taco and chalupa. Everything was super fresh and very tasty (I could believe it if they said their mexican grandmother was cooking in the kitchen) they really nocked it out of the park. We went to Mad Mex as our 1st mexican experience in PBurgh and it was NASTY so we were pleasantly surprised to find this little gem just a few steps away."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good food! First time in this restaurant and we were  pleasantly surprised.   If we are back in the area we will definitely come back.  4+ stars, not 5 only because we rarely give 5's   Portland Maine"}
{"text":"First off, the service is fantastic and the staff is very friendly.  That is the only thing I enjoy about this place. Their margarita leaves me to believe they could screw up a bottled beer. All sugar and couldn't tell if there was a drop of alcohol. None of my 4 group could finish any of them.  I had the carnitas which was large and decently cooked but had absolutely no flavor whatsoever.   If I lived directly next door to this place, I would still never visit again. Just not worth it.  My stomach already hurts and it's only been 30 min"}
{"text":"Patron is close to my house and I know what I am getting when I go there.  I can't give it an elaborate review because there is not much to talk about.  It's slightly more interesting than a bowl of grits....but it gets the job done and I've had worse.  Rounded up from 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Ballin'.  This place is really good for Mexican.  The homemade chips and salsa they give you as soon as you sit down are fantastic.  Everything is very well priced and delicious.  This is a great place.  Just don't start beef with any Steelers players that dine here (I'm looking over at your way Cedric Wilson)."}
{"text":"The only Mexican place in the Pittsburgh area that has a section of the menu just for vegetarians! They offer bottomless chips and salsa and the portions are generous. I had the spinach quesadilla, which was great.   The place is huge so there is no issue for waiting."}
{"text":"I usually just tag along here and snack on chips and salsa but yesterday I went out on a limb and ordered bean tacos. Today it looks like I'm stuck with salmonella or e. coli type systems. Knock yourself out with margs, just not the food."}
{"text":"After living in Phoenix for 5 years, I have developed a strong idea of Mexican food. Sure not all Mexican food is authentic, but that doesn't mean it cant be great food. Patron's is most definitely not authentic. I would call it \"authentic style\" Some of the ingredients are all wrong.    Patron is located inside of a Chili's that went out of business.They redid the interior, but it still has the Chili's feel inside of it.   The chips and salsa are incredibly mediocre. The chips were fresh and correctly seasoned with lime and salt. However, they were all cooked a little different. Some overdone, some underdone.  The salsa was just plain bad. Very little flavor. One of the biggest misconceptions about salsa is that it needs to be fresh. While this is partially true, a lot of the flavor that salsa has to offer needs to be built up over a few hours. The texture was poor, and the taste was that of the walmart brand mild salsa.   Getting on to the entrées...  I had a chicken burrito. Holy mediocre. The tortilla was dry and nearly stale. The chicken was far from noteworthy. Rice tasted like it was a few hours old and kept out. The beans may or may not have come from a can, but they sure tasted like it. In fact, I have had better beans from a can.   The service at the restaurant was poor. The server barely knew anything about mexican food. He must have been knew. Seriously, he worked in a Mexican restaurant and didnt know what lengua and cabeza were...   Drink selection is the same as any chain restaurant. As an avid whisky/scotch/burbon drinker, I didnt find anything that interested me. I will drink a good tequila (beyond patron), but their selection lacked anything special.   If you want mexican food in pittsburgh, there is only one place (to my knowledge), El Campesino.  I would rather go to taco bell than eat at Patron again."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Excellent service, atmosphere and above all FOOD! Get the Queso Fundido!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food. My wife is from Southern California and proclaimed them to have the best refried beans that she has had. Only downsides are the parking lot and it is very loud."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Patron location in East Liberty so I thought giving the Wexford one a shot would produce the same results.  I ordered the Arroz con Pollo and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The vibe felt a little off and maybe because I was comparing the two locations I didn't love the overall experience but the food is still great and the service was good too.  If the East Liberty location is too far, than this is a good sub."}
{"text":"Patron is a great option for a group of friends to get together and have some space to chill and catch up. I think that's what I liked the most that unlike most restaurants around the area, you weren't on top of other people and could keep your conversation private without whispering.  The food was great too. I ordered Taquitos Mexicanos and they were delicious! My friends ordered a dessert that I don't remember the name of but essentially was a fried tortilla with ice cream and they scarfed it down.  I would definitely come back and definitely with a large group of people."}
{"text":"We like going there on Mondays because of $1 tacos and $3 margaritas. The food is good but They recently increased the prices by $2 - $5 on each entree probably because of the location and it being so crowded all the time. Overall it's a good restaurant but not better than mad mex or other authentic Mexican ones. I also had stomach issues after eating there."}
{"text":"This is in a building that many years ago was a south-western themed restaurant called 'Cimarron' that had been closed for 20 years at least. Patron is good high-mid end Mexican food.  The fish tacos were excellent, the chile relleno was ridiculously good.  Probably too far for a lot of PGH people to drive to but it's worth the trip at least, once in awhile .  If you're a Mexican food lover and are making the rounds to 'real' Mexican joints, make sure you put this one on your list ..."}
{"text":"Unbelievable poor service. Walked in ahead of a couple who got waited on right away. We sat for 10 minuets with no one coming over to ask our drink orders. Left without ordering since we never got to speak to our sever. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best Mexican food I had in recent times.  Pollo Compadre & Chipotle Shrimp  were too good.   We are planning to have dinner on valentines day here."}
{"text":"Certainly not the least expensive Mexican restaurant, but I eat here any chance I get. The food is consistently good and the environment is clean and nice."}
{"text":"Bright, friendly atmosphere.  Love the food. Many options, including vegetarian. Great menu. Alcohol is available.  Patio outside for dining."}
{"text":"Some of the best authentic mexican food around,  hands down I have eaten food in Cabo, Puerto Vallarta,  Cancun  and this is as close as it gets.  Great job"}
{"text":"Had Lunch no. 1 consisting of soggy taco with tasteless beef, bland chili relleno, and record beans. Wife had shrimp tacos, said shrimp was tasty but also a soggy presentation. Lots better food down the street."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food!  We often go on Mondays for the tacos and margarita specials--can't beat the prices.  It can get busy so call ahead or use the no wait app."}
{"text":"I was in tampa florida getting fish tacos at a place that was on DDD.  They were amazing to say the least.     AMAZING We also ordered steak burritos..wanted it medium rare.. came back well done. My son's friend said Patron's have great fish tacos.  Wow was he mistaken.  What I perceived to be a fish taco appeared to be fried mash potatoes on a tortilla.. No exaggeration either...a few accompaniments on the side.  They were a total disaster.  I just sucked it up.  My wife got a steak burrito...meat like shoe leather. Honestly, there is not one Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh that can cook a decent piece of steak for a fajita , taco or burrito.  It is the ruination of meat.  If you like shoe leather meat, go to a Mexican restaurant.  Those items there do not impress.  The food overall here is average at best. It's more like cafeteria food./"}
{"text":"Don't recommend ! The management is extremely rude.. We got the \" two for 25\" which is a load of crap... The server \"misinformed\" us about what was included and when we brought this up we were told we were wrong... We asked to speak to management who told us that that the server had given us wrong information about the special and we would have to pay the full price !! Why are we being charged for their severs error? It was clearly a problem with their staff ... When the management came out to see us he was rude and confrontational ... Then the check came and we were charged double for the desserts.. Yep it's official I will never be back here again!!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard American-Mexican.  The chips were crisp, but the salsa was like chopped tomatoes, with no heat at all, milder than mild.  My carnitas dish was pretty good, and the pork itself was very flavorful, tender, and not dried out or tough.  But the refried beans and rice were basic, cookie-cutter fare."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the food is always amazing.  The service is sometimes a little slow/not great, as noted during my weekday lunch visits.  Overall I prefer to go elsewhere for authentic Mexican if given the choice but that doesn't necessarily mean I won't be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Single handed the best Mexican food I've ever had fair prices great service and amazing food. Margaritas were awesome.  I had a mango with salt. It was 5$ (on sale today) great taste. Great texture and lots of booze!!!!"}
{"text":"I am striking out on restaurants this week.  I love Patron's and I have no officially been to all of their locations.  I live very close to the Shadyside and Fox Chapel locations and my boyfriend lives near the Monroeville (our favorite) location.  I came here with my dad for lunch today and I have to say, this has been my least favorite of all.  The chips, which are usually fresh and light and crispy, came out thick, overcooked and stale.  The salsa was freezing cold. Already not off to a great start.  My dad and I both ordered their fajita taco salad (my favorite/go to item at the other locations); mine with chicken, his with beef.  He specifically asked if the beef would be shredded or ground and the server confirmed shredded.  ABout 15 minutes later, our very nice server arrived with our meals.  I knew from the start it didn't look right.  Normally the chicken fajita taco salad has strips of chicken and mine was shredded.  The server could tell I seemed confused, and when I asked if it was fajita chicken salad he said yes.  My dad had ground beef on his.  We ate anyway and they didn't taste bad, but it wasn't the normal preparation and we had to be back at work in a timely manner.  We got our bill when we were finished and were charged for two taco salads, just as we had assumed.  The overall experience was just kind of annoying. It was extremely loud in there plus the food wasn't up to the other locations standards how I was used to.  Our server was very very nice and attentive, but I think from now on, I will stick to Monroeville or Shadyside until there is a little more consistency throughout the chain."}
{"text":"we SO love Patron's anywhere in Pittsburgh.  Have been to the Fox Chapel, East Liberty and Monroeville locations regularly for the past year and have had excellent service and food at all.  Really love this place - its one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Patron is a spacious, colorful and cheerful atmosphere restaurant so I recommend for large group of people. I like the fact is not spicy at all but they also have hot spicy food too. Portion are large, service is good . The staffs sing Happy Birthday to you in Mexican Style if you ask to do.  I just feel that the vegetables are frozen type, but for it's price and large portion that's okay."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad. But the margaritas were not good! I got a strawberry and lime margarita and they both had a very weird mint taste to them."}
{"text":"I haven't ever wanted to come here in the past simply because Mexican food in Pittsburgh has largely been a letdown for me, but I recently went for the Monday night $1 taco/$3 margarita special at the behest of my roommate and it was a decent enough experience. The atmosphere was very open, airy, and colorful. It definitely bordered on the kitschy, but most Mexican restaurants that aren't in California seem to be that way. (The décor reminded my roommate and me of the TexMex places we ate at on a spring break trip a few years back.) The staff was friendly, albeit a little scattered and spread thin. Our server was new, so I can't really comment on him properly.   The house chips and salsa we started with were free (a huge plus!) and quite delicious. The salsa lacked the complexity of Verde's, but it didn't cost any money so I can't complain too much. Once we ordered the rest of our food it came very quickly. I tried the chicken taco and the margarita. Only the hard shell tacos are $1 on Mondays which honestly should have been advertised since it caused some confusion, but a lot of that could have been due to our green server not explaining the deal to us at all. The taco was delicious and fairly simple...just shredded chicken fried with green and red peppers and onions. It was topped with lettuce, and they also offer cheese if you want. I'd eat it again but only on Mondays for $1. The margarita was clearly made from a mix, so I wouldn't waste my money on it if I ever came back here. (Margaritas aren't that hard to get right!) They have pretty decent beer prices, so I could see myself going that route in the future. Overall Patron is a solid place to get some very cheap tacos during a non-happy hour time of night with lots of available seating, so I give it three stars for that. Better margaritas would have been nice, but for $3 I suppose that's just too good to be true!"}
{"text":"This place..THIS PLACE!! So good! My boyfriend and I decided to randomly come here on a Monday night for dinner and a drink. Low and behold, Monday night they have the best specials!! Low price tacos and margaritas (that taste WAY better than Mad Mex) which I'm not surprised because it is truly an authentic Mexican restaurant. We will surely be back, everything was amazing! My boyfriend always gets the house margarita on the rocks anywhere we go and he said it's one of the best he's had, and as for me I had the strawberry frozen margarita which was also one of the best I've ever had! The tacos were to die for they really hit the spot :) and I can't forget the fact that they have fresh, hot chips and home made salsa as soon as we were seated which were (you guessed it) seriously the best I've ever had!!! We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see SO MANY 4-star reviews for this restaurant.  While the service is very good, as is the pure quantity of food, the actual food itself leaves a lot to be desired (in my opinion).  Maybe folks are purely interested in price-point with this spot - but I don't get it...and this was a Saturday night.  The chips tasted \"blah\" and stale, the salsa was watery, and the entrée was bland.  That said, the staff was over-the-top friendly and the décor of the restaurant was fitting for a fun, lively, Mexican restaurant.  All in all - as I'm new to the Pittsburgh dining scene, I only hope there are better alternatives out there for good, fast, cheap Mexican food."}
{"text":"The only place I can find a chile relleno since I moved back from Santa Fe. I go there about once a month to get my fix."}
{"text":"Food is decent, tasted good but nothing too special. Free chips and salsa came out quickly. We went during lunchtime so it wasn't busy, but the waitress was always checking up and very friendly which made up for the alright food. Prices were the same as most restaurants $9 for most lunch items and $15 for dinner."}
{"text":"Seeing as how this is my favorite restaurant in the area and I've been here a couple times since I've started Yelping, I'm not sure how I've let Patron go without a review. Patron isn't a place I've been to a once or twice and had a good experience; Patron is a place I've been to about fifteen times and had an excellent experience every time. Their salsa is great and the chips are always fresh unlike some other Mexican joints in the surrounding areas. Literally every meal I've ordered here has been outstanding. Most recently I got the fish tacos, and although I normally don't care for fish in my tacos, Patron does it right - lightly fried and spectacular flavors in the fish batter.  Their margaritas are good and priced modestly, too. It isn't just the food that keeps me coming back to Patron, though, the service is always top notch. On my most recent excursion, a man named Jesus helped me. It goes without saying that the service was divine."}
{"text":"95cent tacos on Monday.  Beef or Chicken.. can't beat that. The food is all amazingly delicious.  Margaritas?  not so much.  We sat at the bar this last trip, and ordered two regular margaritas.  He went and poured it out of a big jug.  ew.  I'm really suprised that an \"authentic\" mexican place (with awesome food) has such horrible discusting margaritas... Even on the drink menu,  it says \"recipe from my papa\"  I really doubt that recipe is from anyones papa... Whos papa makes their margaritas with Daily's premade margarita mixers?  Mine doesn't, and he's not even from Mexico.  lol.    Anyways!  I love everything else about the place. just don't order a margarita (if you know what real ones taste like anyway) get a beer instead.."}
{"text":"This is a chain of 4 Mexican restaurants with reliably good food and reasonable prices. The service here is always extraordinary, and the food is served without delay.  Their large draft beers are a full 32 oz, just so you know what you are ordering.  It looks a bit comical, but it works out great if you love beer."}
{"text":"I went there for happy hour on a Monday and they had $1 tacos as well as $3 margaritas ($4 if you want to add a flavor) on special. The happy hour price is amazing and while the quality of food isn't top notch or super authentic, you definitely can't beat the price. I enjoyed my drink and food and wish I had gone more before I left Pittsburgh. Everything came out really fast which was great. Our waiter was also very attentive and happily dealt with us even though we were indecisive about our orders."}
{"text":"We come here a lot.  It's one of our favorite go to places.  The food is authentic, quick service and great prices.  One of my favorites are the enchiladas suissa.  They have the best salsa I have ever had which is free and comes with endless chips. The entire waitstaff it's friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible service. It took 20 minutes before we saw our waiter.  My wife's shrimp dish was cold, and had to be sent back.  My Chile Colorado was tough and stringy. The flavor was marginal at best.  There are many decent Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh and a few really good ones. This is at the bottom of the pile. We will not return."}
{"text":"Living in the area for the last 2 years, I was hoping to find a Mexican Restaurant that was close to me with good authentic food. Unfortunately I did not find neither at Patron's.   Note, I came from the Los Angeles area and grew up with great authentic Mexican food all around me.   I was hoping this place would of been better. Friendly staff, waiter was awesome, price was a little higher than I expected and I wouldn't of minded that if the food was better."}
{"text":"This review is going to encompass a couple of visits over the years. More specifically the past 2 years of Cinco de Mayo visits.   Patron is a local Mexican chain with 4 locations around Pittsburgh, the newest being the local I will be talking about in East Liberty on the corner of S. Highland and Center Ave.  PIttsburghers never miss a chance to indulge in lecherous behavior and Cinco de Mayo at a Mexican place is no different, even on a Tuesday. My girlfriend and I had made plans to attend Patron yesterday as we had last year right when it opened its doors and pretend to be stereotypical. We made plans for 7pm, which understandably is prime time and we expected a wait, so in anticipation of events I called to add my name to the list ahead of time to cut down on the wait. The hostess must have stepped away as on of the other staff took to the phone [first bad sign]. In broken English I was told of the 1-1.5 hour wait [hence calling 45 minutes early] and I said to add my name to the list. Upon arrival I went to check on where I was in line, just to discover that my name had never been added to anything and that we were back in the queue [1 star for that]. However, we had done this last year also and it was lovely outside so we decided to wait anyways.   In anticipation of the wait, Patron had set up a front bar where you would be able to have house margaritas or beers while you wait [good redemption]. While we waited we observed the hostess staff where at one point 4 people were standing debating who to seat next. The process was fully manual and groups came and left in droves so crossing outs and addings were happening left and right. We thought this quite inefficient, the same remark we made in 2014. [however that was about a week after their grand opening so we let that slide]. The waiting area, similar to the rest of the restaurant is colorful and ethnic and airy. Very pleasant. After about an hour we were given a booth in the back.  Now the real wait began. For about 7-10 minutes we sat until a busser appeared to bring us salsa and a basket of chips. Our hungry selves immediately delved into these and soon found ourselves thirsting for water. However, no waiter was in sight. After about another 15 minutes rather than a waiter appearing we were greeted by the manager who brought us more chips and salsa and finally flagged down exhausted looking teen so take our beer orders. [Beer works for thirst too but water would have been nice too] Those finally arrived 10 minutes later with surprise! more chips. We observed the neighboring tables who were in similar pain. Nobody to help them along in the process of anything. We kept our eyes out for our frantic waitron who continuously disappeared into a black hole. When we did see him he was frazzled and sweating and busy... with... I actually couldn't tell you. We finally flagged him down to ask for food orders. One side of guac, one Fajita Chesadilla and an Enchilada Carnitas.   Finally. Progress... until the waiter came back and asked if the Enchiladas would be with chicken or beef.... um... carnitas. ... Know you menu.   Eventually waters appeared, which was fantastic at that point in time. While waiting for our food, the waitron checked on us apologizing profusely for a backed up kitchen. hm... They sat a table next to us who had eventually just abandoned the process because of no service. [Not the kitchen's fault]. In attempts of cleaning abandoned menu I finally understood how the service was slow. Waitron would do one thing then run back then come out do a single thing and then return to the waitron station... no dear... you made 3 trips for something that could have been 1. This is why you don't hire new meat right before you busy drinking days.... especially when they are 18 and don't know any better. [1 star for this]  To the actual food. It was good. 0 complaints there. By the end of the evening we had been there for 3 hours for an entire meal. [which was good and still decently warm when it arrived] Even the complimentary shot of tequila was not a good remedy for this. and $25 a person.... i guess that's $8 and hour... [1 star for this]  Understandably, we half knew what we were getting ourselves into for the wait outside which is why this doesn't have a single star rating. Also they had a live jazz[ish? band we couldn't figure out what the trumpet player was doing] band playing which was nice, just a little bit [very] loud.  We will be moving our Cinco de Mayo festivities somewhere else next year."}
{"text":"GREAT restaurant for families. My wife and I go with our 2 kids (age 4 and 2) and have gone with other families multiple times.  The service has been excellent and gets us in and out quickly (always important with kids) and is very understanding.  Food-wise, I recommend the carnitas and my wife likes their enchiladas. Their homemade guacamole is phenomenal and they make it right by your table.  recently had the shrimp quesadilla which was only ok.  they also make great margaritas that are quite strong (again helping with the kids!)  It's not the cheapest Mexican place but worth it service-wise."}
{"text":"The service is great. The chips taste like they are from a bag. The salsa was good. The for was nothing to write about!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing good things about the place I thought we'd give it a shot...disappointing at best!! Not sure what jar they get their salsa out of but putting it in the little glass bottles doesn't hide the fact that it's terrible...her order came out and it was as if they forgot to cut the meat up...huge, dry chunks of beef & chicken...I ordered the patron fajitas and while the shrimp was large & tasty I bit into a piece of chicken with BONES still in it...yummy!! The lime margs were passable...we ordered pico and got the smallest plastic container...you couldn't even get a chip into it??! Plus it was not fresh at all...we also ordered some chipotle queso and got pink watery stuff...zero taste!! Will never return!"}
{"text":"First time at Patron. The restaurant is very nicely decorated, a very festive place! Our server, David, was excellent and attentive. The food was good, but not as flavorful as you would expect from Mexican food.  The chicken fajita was huge, but no cheese was served with the fajitas.  The enchiladas in 4 different fillings, chicken, beef, bean and cheese could have had more flavor, but I do not get the shredded lettuce and tomato slices served on top of the enchiladas. The chips were warm, crisp and delicious.  The salsa was awesome. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"We went to patron on a Sunday night. His was our first time here. When we first sat down, a staff member greeted us and gave us chips and salsa. He was very polite. We had Dina as our server. She was great as well. She couldn't have been any better. We ordered shrimp fajitas for 2 and a couple other small things. They came out very fast. The portions were huge and the food was even better. No complaints and we will be sure to return in the near future.  The staff was outstanding and the food was on point."}
{"text":"GREAT drinks!!! They are strong and good! Ask for Brandy the bartender! She will do you right!!!  The food is also amazing as far a Pittsburgh mexican is concerned. It had a lot of flavor and they give really big portions! I have the steak burrito and my husband had the combo platter and mom had the chicken chimichanga and I would recommend them all!  The only downfall for me is that there were not more combo platters, and that I like fajita burritos and that was not on the menu."}
{"text":"We really like going here. There aren't many choices for Mexican food in the area, but we're really glad we found this place. It has a ton of options. I usually get tamales. They have a great variety of margarita flavors too!"}
{"text":"Great food, great Margaritas! Surprisingly enough the chicken soup is so good!  Loaded with chicken and veggies, you can't go wrong!  Service is always top of the line at Patrons!"}
{"text":"It's a great place! Food is fantastic, service is great. The place is decorated very brightly...cheers you up on a rainy day! Parking is plentiful, easy to see from the road."}
{"text":"What a far way from the Chilis this location this use to be. Don't confuse this with El Patron. What I like about this business is they always have some special going on. A happy hour, burrito Tuesday etc. Definitely going during happy hour, the drinks are such a great deal you can get a couple for the price of one. They have their own parking lot which is nice. They do get very busy so get there a head of time to catch a seat!"}
{"text":"We used the no wait app and were able to get seated within 10 mins of showing up.  The staff immediately brings warm chips and salsa as soon as you sit down.  The food was good and fairly  priced and the service was quick."}
{"text":"First time here...,last time here.  Food was pretty good. Service was absolutely atrocious. Worst we have ever experienced...ever. I won't elaborate.  Just bad."}
{"text":"Delicious food, reasonable price, huge portions, and great service!! Will definitely be a repeat customer!!"}
{"text":"At first, I was like ehhh this is slightly pricey for Mexican food, but their portions are HUGE! I ordered the steak fajitas and had 3 plates of food including my sizzling steak and peppers, tortillas, and a ton of sides. Everything was well flavored. I tried a lot of my friends' dishes too and they were all amazing.   The staff was was friendly and fast. We came with a large party for my friend's birthday and they were great about accommodating all of our requests. Everyone in our group was super indecisive about our orders and kept having to make corrections or additions and the waitress handled it very professionally.  They also have a great selection of margaritas!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the north hills!  Their salsa is my absolute favorite!  The service is so fast and everyone is very friendly!  The manager always at the front desk greeting customers smiling!  My only minor critique - while the service is speedy - you have one person who seats you, another who takes your drink, another that gives you chips and salsa and maybe another that takes your order etc.  at this point who is getting my tip?  Great food though, for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Do I talk about the nachos and salsa? Do I talk about the meal I ate? Do I talk about the large draft of beer I had? Do I talk about the friendly service?  Oh wow, the possibilities. If you are in the up and coming area in the East Liberty stop in and grab a meal. I had the shrimp dish (I hope I spelled chimichanga correctly) which was my only meal for the day, and that was fine by me. The draft beer was cold and in a very big mug, on a hot day it was needed.  Awesome service with fast service will have me coming back."}
{"text":"this is a far better choice for mexican food than emiliano's (aka don pablo's+). but when it was suggested, my mom complained that \"it's always so loud in there!\"  i thought she was just having an old lady moment, so i called to make our reservation, and told them we had someone hard of hearing in our group so we would need a quiet corner booth. mom was mortified.  we get there, they ignore my request and sit us at a booth right in the middle of the room, and i start to think it IS pretty loud in there. then....  BOOM BOOM BOOM HOOOOOOOORN clapclapclapclap  a troupe of dudes explodes out of the kitchen for the loudest birthday serenade ever, complete with longhorn and a stick bangin on a paint bucket. there were 3 birthdays that night.  and, as luck would have it, it was my mom's birthday, too! guess what happened next?  :)  the food is above average, and the house margarita was delightful. just be prepared for a boisterous dining experience!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, no wait (on a weeknight). I was surprised not to see any mole on the menu. I ordered the vegetarian fajita. It was alright, nothing amazing. I would probably go back and order something else... drink selection seemed good."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Patron last night for the first and the last time.  What a disappointment.  From the street, the place looks cute.  And I will give two stars for the decor.  However, the food was a huge flop.  First, I had the red sangria (which was so so) and my boyfriend had a classic margarita on the rock, which tasted like a mix out of some plastic jug.  Truly awful.  Then the chips & salsa arrived.  The chips were unremarkable but the salsa (which was puréed and runny) was clearly out of a jar.  Nothing tasted fresh.  The menu was so huge there's no possible way anything is fresh or from scratch.  I don't see this place surviving long in the shadyside neighborhood.   In summary, I'd rather eat at Chipotle.  And that says alot."}
{"text":"It was good,I'm not a real Mexican food eater. Just got the patron fajitas. Meat was seasoned very good(chicken). Definitely not Taco Bell,the person I was with had a burrito that looked like a loaf of bread"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican cuisine with a vast menu, friendly owner and staff, tacky in a good way decor, and delicious food and drinks at a decent price! Free chips and salsa and big portions, too! I cannot wait to come back. My chicken fajitas were so good that I kept eating beyond capacity. They have a good tequila selection for a neighborhood Mexican place, as well."}
{"text":"Standard sit down Mexican joint. Food is good and it's always best to get margaritas by the pitcher. Prices are a bit high for a Mexican restaurant, but maybe it's because of being located in Wexford."}
{"text":"Recently went to the Patron in Fox Chapel and also the one in East Liberty. I really think that the quality of their food has improved a lot. Their menu is big. Service is quick. Portions are pretty big. And the food is very good. Definitely would recommend if you're looking for your standard Mexican fare."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why people like this place. The food is mediocre at best and it is EXPENSIVE. Last night I had a $15 burrito that was not very good, rather bland and tasteless. Even if it was a $5 burrito, I would have still left disappointed.  I have had a lot of good mexican food in California, so this place has been a disappointment every time I have stopped in to eat. For a burrito, I would highly recommend going to Chipotle instead. They offer way better tasting burritos and at 1/3 the price."}
{"text":"Monday taco night, I had chicken and beef tacos. Each taco was a $1. What a good deal, the chicken tacos were excellent. Simple fare, hard shells with lettuce and cheese, I added some of their salsa and was extremely surprised at how good these were. The beef tacos were good, but the chicken were great. I suggest adding a side of rice and beans combo which is enough for two. What a great place to take the kids and a bargain meal."}
{"text":"The service was very fast and the staff was friendly.  I went here with friends recently and had a great time.  The tacos were excellent and so were the Margarita's..YUM!!  I definitely plan to return soon."}
{"text":"The food and drink have been good but the loud sports bar atmosphere with glaring large screen tv s distracted from the Mexican atmosphere.  They used to have a Saturday special entree that they discontinued to our disappointment.  No matter how good the food is, loud tv screens just aren't relaxing. The bar and entire dining room seems like a sports bar..  We went down the road to el campesino and had a quiet awesome dinner. I will miss patrons food but I guess management likes loud sports channels instead  of providing customers with a peaceful  environment   The service was good here, but so is el campesino"}
{"text":"They use lots of artificial syrups in margaritas, don't they know what a lime is?  Not authentic, but to a pittsburgher maybe this is.   This place is so loud and unpleasant to be in. Sounds echo , voices carry. The birthday bucket beatings were obnoxious . This place wouldn't flynin the southwest   No Mexican music but glaring tv s ... Feels like a fast food place , not warm and cozy"}
{"text":"I got a coupon In  The mail saying they were open, drove one hour to get here. They weren't open and they could have cared less about false advertisement  They don't even state their hours on their website and they close 9 pm on Sunday? Ridiculous. I complained and they said they were fixing that problem  I came back and here's my report  The margaritas are fake tasting but for a Pittsburgh palate this may suffice. Chips need salt and salsa needs some heat to it. It tastes like canned tomato sauce   The food wasn't flavored or seasoned well, but this region may like bland , tasteless food   I want a real margarita made with limes, cut fresh, tequila and orange liquor, but this place won't change, they are making a go of it with cheap, substandard ingredients  The so called manager was just a guy at the hostess stand. He was useless. Poor management!  They don't use the correct poblano pepper in chili rellenos, they cut corners"}
{"text":"My review score is skewed based on my waiter service that day. Slow and unattentive would be accurate. The entire staff was very friendly but it took about 5 minutes to get a menu, 10 more to place our drink order and then another 10 or so minutes just to return with the drinks and take our dinner order. I was particularly thrown off by this based on other reviewers claims of good service.   The atmosphere was clean, colorful and festive. But I'd eat in a dark alley if the food was delightful so let's move on to... The food.   I ordered a chimichanga and it was very good. Crispy shell and the sauce was very tasty. The sides were good but not spectacular - the star was the chimi. The chips and salsa were plentiful and excellent. Didn't splurge on dessert but maybe next time!"}
{"text":"Ok. Not great. Actually, maybe not so great.  I had carnitas, which was pretty good but maybe not as flavorful as others I've had elsewhere.  But still good. The sides were the predictable ones (rice, beans) and a bit on the meh side. The chips 'n salsa, normally not something you'd want to judge a restaurant by, were not so good. It's not like these ever need to be standout good. But they should at least not be noticeably sub par.  We were in the neighborhood and wanted an uncomplicated and predictable meal, which in some sense it was. But I would hesitate to head there as if it were a destination.   On the plus side, the staff were nice."}
{"text":"This mexican grill is excellent! I must say every time i have came here, it has been great! They have drink specials, the food is cheap and delicious, and you get a ton!!! you will not leave hungry.. i promise you that!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing even with low expectations coming in. Guacamole had unripe avocados and no salt. The shimp tacos tasted like a salt lick and came with a mustard sauce more suited for pastrami.  The chimichanga was swimming in slush-like refried beans. The food is a mediocre american attempt at mexican. Would not recommend anything we ate here. Star is for the decent service -- including our waitress' valiant attempt to mash hard avocados."}
{"text":"I'm looking for a mexican restaurant to rest my cravings, and this one had a great fajita salad with complimentary chips and salsa. I would given four stars, but my waitress just kept \"forgetting \" to give me a lemon for my water. But I'm still happy with my lunch."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food! I really love all food, but chips and queso has a soft spot in my heart. One thing that instantly stood out from other Mexican restaurants was the fact that they bring you your own bowl for your salsa. It's the little things in life! I feel like all Mexican restaurants should do this. Another thing that stood out was they had quite a large variety of menu items and different things I haven't seen from other Mexican restaurants.   I ordered my go-to dish, chicken enchiladas with queso sauce and all rice. Definitely one of my favorite chicken enchiladas out there. Why? Because they filled the tortillas up with a lot of chicken and smothered it in cheese sauce, yummy! My mom ordered the Camerones Patron and she raves about it still!! She cannot wait to go back there and take my dad. It was pretty big with a lot of grilled shrimp, vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, squash and carrots) drizzled in queso with a mound of rice. We were both very pleased and will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Yum delicious shrimp tacos. Very friendly staff and cool decor."}
{"text":"Delicious. Enjoyed the atmosphere and the service. Flavors great. Best Mexican food in the area. Would recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Patron for the first time last night  - $.95 tacos and $2.95 margaritas! We are officially obsessed and agreed to make this our Monday tradition.   Our waiter, Jerry, was absolutely amazing - so friendly and attentive, he made us both feel welcome and comfortable.  The food was absolutely amazing, we both couldn't get over how tender and flavorful the chicken was. I'm usually a big baby about spicy things but the complimentary salsa was perfect for both my husband (who loves spicy items) and I. We were so impressed that we were offered refills as well.  We aren't usually dessert people but couldn't resist the fried ice cream and we were so pleased that we kept talking about it all evening.  Finally, the margaritas: for $1.00 more you can add flavor and at Jerry's suggestion, I went with a strawberry-mango one. It tasted like a smoothie! So delicious.   I'm so glad I finally have something to look forward to on a Monday. Thank you, Patron!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I hadn't reviewed this yet. It's been a while since we were there, but we really liked it and we're happy the new one is open, since it's closer to where we travel."}
{"text":"Went here with my sister on a Friday evening.  Amazingly we got right in and seated during dinner rush?! Ya, the amazingness continues as the chip cart revs past and drops off amazing salsa and chips. Poof there is the waiter swiftly acquired our drinks and before we made a dent in our chips our food was ready?!  I'm still amazed at how this happens in Cranberry on a Friday night?   My food was yummy, all veggies and rice. I had a really nice time there and was recommending it to friends before i even left the parking lot!"}
{"text":"Patron Mexican Grill has hit our high mark in the Pittsburgh area! Since coming to western Pennsylvania for an extended stay from Nevada we've craved real Mexican food and found absolutely nothing that compares to home until Patron. Everything from the ambiance to the food is authentic and spot on. We ate at the original location in Wexford and for about an hour or so it felt like we were back home.  The menu is extensive with many ways to enjoy a true south of the boarder experience. I had the \"Amigo: 2 choices with a Tamale and Chile Relleno\" and my wife had the \"Gorditas Pastor\" both came with rice and beans. The salsa that arrived with the fresh tortilla chips was good for what we've discovered as the regional level of heat for western Pennsylvania so we asked for the hot salsa kept in the back and it did not disappoint in flavor or heat level.  Service was great and attentive and we felt good about our experience and having found some actual Mexican food in the area worth eating, which by the way is extremely well priced.  We're fans without a doubt and will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday for dinner around 5pm. There wasn't really anyone there but also the place is huge so I'm sure you can come anytime without having to wait.   I got the Enchiladas Mexicanas which comes with 3 enchiladas with your choice of chicken, beef, cheese only, or beans on the inside and either the green or red sauce (you can get both too).   I got 2 chicken and 1 beef with both the red and green sauce. It wasn't all that great the red sauce was better than green and the protein was 'whatever.'   Also their menu was a little bit confusing. It was ridden with typos and errors so some of the items on the menu didn't make any sense and had to be clarified by the waiter.   I wouldn't come again...I would probably go to Las Palmas for some yummy tacos."}
{"text":"2nd review of patrons.  This one was a bit different.  We had our kids and the experience was a bit different.  We were looking at the kids menu and there were 3 items: burger, chicken fingers, and tacos.  Our kids are 4 and 2 so our oldest wanted a burger.  The burger and fries were huge ( similar to an eat n park super burger) and our son barely ate a part of it.  Our food was great, but if you have small kids, watch out for the limited kids menu with huge portions."}
{"text":"Okay, so I will start out by stating that my expectations were low for Mexican food in Pittsburgh, but Patron was good. I wouldn't say it was my favorite by any means, but it was good. The server was extremely nice and attentive. I was famished and he got us out chips and salsa pronto. The cheese dip was also quite yummy. I got a cheese quesadilla--it was simple but hit the spot. My husband got the fajita quesadilla--it was great. Keep in mind not to overeat on chips as the portions are large here.   The restaurant was pretty empty but we went during an off time. The margaritas looked pretty good. The table next to us got two and my mouth was watering (darn you baby). They have a nice bar area and TVs available."}
{"text":"Free warm chips and Salsa (good salsa by the way)  Friendly service, plenty of food for your money, chili relleno was decent, burritos are good, tacos, tamales were  good too, everything was average... Atmosphere was festive. I will go back."}
{"text":"It is difficult to find good Tex-Mex in Pittsburgh. Patron is exceptional. I lived in TX for 21 years. This place is perfect."}
{"text":"The second most authentic Mexican experience I've had in Pittsburgh (see Edgar's Tacos in the Strip for the first).  Chips and salsa are brought to you as soon as you sit down, there are plenty of options, even for a vegetarian like me (that don't involve tofu, which has no place in Mexican food). It seems to be the only place around that has a wide selection of traditional Mexican beers.  I find the atmosphere a little hokey, but I feel like that goes with the territory."}
{"text":"Advertised a Mother's Day Special $20.00 for 1 app. 2 entres and a shared dessert. The free app. Was a bowl of guacamole, entres were okay, but they wouldn't honor the advertised free dessert. Did get a nice rose. Margarita was pretty good. They should have given us the dessert!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Southern California, so my standards are pretty high for Mexican food. I did like the chips and  my own salsa bowl. The rice and beans were decent too. I ordered chicken enchiladas that were smothered in a processed white cheese sauce . My friend ordered arroz con pollo. It came with rubbery grilled chicken covered in the same white cheese sauce with rice and steamed frozen veggies. Is it too much to ask for fresh veggies. We asked if the guacamole was fresh, and the waiter replied, \"yes, in the morning it is.\"  It goes to say that I won't be coming back and neither will my friend who lives here."}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 stars. The first thing that you notice upon entering the restaurant is the colorful chairs, tables, and streamers. We waited for a few minutes at the entrance for the seating host. A man finally showed up and directed us to a table. The server took our drink orders and asked us if we were ready to order food. My husband replied that we needed a few more minutes to look at the menu. The server thought that he said that we wanted tortilla chips and salsa. Well, OK. The server returned with two waters although my husband ordered a soda. My husband again requested a soda, and the server brought it out with the chips. I ordered the Patron Quesadilla Fajita, which says in the menu \"filled with your choice of marinated sirloin strips, marinated chicken strips & shrimp.\" I actually did not get to choose among those three because they are all included. My husband ordered the Patron Fajita. We both enjoyed the taste of the food, and his fajita generously contained very large shrimp."}
{"text":"Bright friendly atmosphere, cheerful staff, quick service, hot food that tastes good. I do not have anything to complain about with this place. Free fresh chips and salsa brought to the table as soon as you sit down is always a plus and the way it should be. Go for lunch and use one of the Enjoyment Coupons and you can both eat for $4 plus tax and tip. The place is clean and the temperature inside is always just right, not to hot or not too cold. What else do you need ?"}
{"text":"Love El Paso from Chippewa and was told that Patron was even better. So we made the trek to Wexford and were pleased. The menu is almost identical to El Paso's menu and the prices are the same. The wait staff was friendly and the food was served quickly.  Nothing bad to say, however, we will not be giving up on El Paso unless we are in the area. But I do suggest you go if you are nearby."}
{"text":"Bring on the Margarita's!!!  My husband and I love this restaurant.  They have great service, food and DRINKS!!!    On Friday and Saturday nights there is usually a wait.  They usually tell you way longer than it actually is.  I love this place because they always provide great service.  You are greeted at your table by a very courteous waiter/waitress.  I would suggest ordering the margarita on the rocks with salt for a beverage when you first meet your server.    You are then provided their delicious ships and salsa.  The chips are light and crispy!!!  The salsa is not chuncky at all, so if that's the way you like it..you will LOVE it!!!  The food is processed after you have a drink and a chance to taste the chips and salsa.  The service is not rushed in any way.  It's not slow service by any means but they will space out your appetizers and entrees if they are ordered.  The prices of the meail are very decent.  The drinks are a bit pricy but they do offer the pitcher of margarita's if you don't mind sharing!!  I highly reccomend this place to anyway.  They can also accomodate large parties!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my Dad and was very pleased to find a solid Tex Mex restaurant in Pittsburgh.   Wasn't sure that was even possible having just moved here from San Antonio.  Chips were home made and salsa was very tasty.   Had the lunch plate with a taco, a chile relleno and guac salad.    Chile Relleno was yummy.   Wish I'd remember to ask for a soft taco - can't stand hard shell taco's - who eats those anymore?  Beans were good.     3 stars for the food, and an extra star for the service and bright interior.   Looking forward to returning to try the carnitas and carne guisada.  Had major deja vu as my sister used to work at Cimarron back in the day - LOL"}
{"text":"A good down home family Mexican place. It's not the most inventive nor creative menu but that's not why you're here. You're hear for the friendly staff, the big portions, the family friendly atmosphere and ... Drumroll.... THE MARGARITAS! Order the Cadillac just because....and they'll treat ya right."}
{"text":"This place rocks.  Monday's they have 95 cent taco's and we like to ask for Gina.  She is a great waitress and really completes the experience.  Take your friends and enjoy authentic Mexican food at a price you just can't beat!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Great atmosphere. Authentic food and fantastic drinks. Good service! Update-if you want good Mexican food and atmosphere, visit Patron's. I've been a long time customer. And have a margarita, delicious!"}
{"text":"Gourmet this place is not. Very average food. The diablo sauce tastes like spicy ketchup. Service was excellent though."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the nice experience here, since reviewers seem pretty mixed about this place. Our waitress was nice enough and started us with a good portion of chips and salsa. We went for the fajitas for two, and after just a short while an overly huge platter of grilled food came out. The iron pan was chock full of onions, peppers, meats, and shrimp, and everything was quite flavorful. It also came with two separate plates of rice, beans, guac, and chopped veggies with sour cream, all of which were good. Along with the tortillas, all of this turned out to be way too much food for two people. So all in all, it was a pretty good value."}
{"text":"Having spent many years in the southwest (not Texas), I compare everything based on my favorites there.  I have visited this place over 5 times since they opened. I go back and forth between liking and not liking the food here. Chips and salsa are a good.  If you want flan (which is the only reason I go back) and it's late in the evening, make sure you order it with your meal. I get it packed for take out."}
{"text":"Great service and food. A little pricey for what it is but none the less delicious food.  The free chips were nice and a plus"}
{"text":"I have been to Patron for the first time now. I love Mexican food! I really like the way this restaurant looks inside. It's fun, colorful and the restaurant is huge! Staff is really friendly, from the receptionist to the waiters, everyone was exceptional.   We have ordered a huge bowl of guacamole, which they prepare in front of you to your liking! And I loved it! There could have been more cilantro (but then again there can never be too much cilantro, right?:))  I ordered the enchilada suprema and while it was good, it didn't really blow me away. You get 4 enchiladas, each of them filled differently. One with chicken, ground beef, cheese and a bean filling. The chicken was definitely my favourite as it had the right amount of everything.   I think Patron is quite expensive for what you actually get. The quality wasn't the best and even though the staff was good, the food was just okay, so 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"I have been to Patron multiple times, on a weekday , a weekend and on a Monday. I would rate it as a 3.5 overall.  Let me say why I specifically mention Monday. Monday's are 3$ Margaritas at patron, so it is extremely crowded.  Usually there will be a 20-30 minute wait. After we did manage to wait, we were seated and the service was extremely slow. We were halfway through our entree but the Margaritas weren't out yet. So we ended up cancelling them. We had ordered the shrimp tacos, but found the shrimp to be uncooked and the vegetables quite raw so ended up returning this.  When I have been here on other days, patron is less chaotic. The food quality was definitely better, and the service was good. Certainly the food is more authentic, compared to Mad Mex. Even the drinks are better by a notch. Patron is certainly not a completely authentic Mexican place, but is more of a family friendly Tex Mex place, with a couple of more dishes than an average one, coupled with a good selection of drinks."}
{"text":"Dined here a couple of weekends ago because all of the surrounding establishments had waits between one and two hours.  We walked in and were seated immediately (this speaks volumes).  It's the only restaurant in the area that was empty, dead! Every time I drive past the place, it looks vacant.  The food was served super fast, and the wait staff was very attentive.  I would give both 5 stars.  The problem is the taste of the food.  I found the meals to be very bland and unremarkable.  My try once more for the specials mentioned in the other posts."}
{"text":"The grilled steak in my burrito was incredible! Service is excellent.. highly recommend for the Mexican food critics."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place after hearing for some time from others raving about it.  I was kind of underwhelmed.  The parking lot is a disaster.  It needs resurfaced and it's hard to navigate.  The waiting area is tiny and congested.  The patrons are suburban families looking to feed their families and I noticed large parties.    You got your atypical chips and salsa.  We had a good (no, actually, she was great) waitress that was very attentive to our needs.  I had just gotten off work and devoured chips--she brough back salsa and chips.  They were just okay.  Too many broken pieces of chips in the basket which makes it hard to scoop the salsa.  It was not bland.  I split a steak and chicken fajita meal with my father--it was sized for two to share and I was impressed with the serving.  It was good, but it did not come out sizzling.  I was a little disappointed with that.  They give three tortillas (not house made) which... was kind of disappointing.  If you want to take leftovers home, you can't really re-make without tortillas...  I guess you can ask for more but it just didn't make sense.   I also had a tamale on the side.  It was just okay...  The masa was really good on the one side of the tamale--soft, flavorful, shredded chicken inside.  The other side was dry.  It was almost as if they didn't roll the tamale correctly before they steamed it.  Honestly, if they could have executed this correctly, it would have made my visit because everything else was... not that exceptional.  Since I have to write something positive each time I want to say that our waitress was phenominal.  She was so attentive to everything from the aforementioned chips, to drink refills, to telling me that the fajitas came with guacamole (I had asked for a side of it not paying attention to the menu that it was included).  I really appreciated that.  Our table didn't have hot sauce on it (how can the busser miss that?) and she brought me her recommended kind.    I will not return, I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Margaritas and yummy mexican food? Sign me up! Had a recent girls night here. Great service, yummy drinks (get a mango marg...delish!) and good dinner. All of us got something different and we were all pleased with our meals. The decor is fun and decorative. Try the choripollo. I enjoyed it. The darling, accent-bearing waiter not only humored us by snapping a few pics of girl's night, but also offered some awesome scenery in the form of his fabulous round behind every time he walked by. I almost asked him to recite the menu in my ear just to hear him whisper some Spanish close to me, but I resisted. Great place for a girl's night...even if you don't get a cute waiter. The Margaritas are strong, the food is good, and the atmosphere is fun. What else do you need?"}
{"text":"We were here around 8 on a Tuesday night and there was plenty of seating. The service was a little slow, but the food was totally bomb. The chips were delicious and the salsa was flavorful bur not crazy spicy. I had the vegetarian #3 and had to take my burrito home. So. Much. Food. If we ever find ourselves hungry and in the area, we'll stop again."}
{"text":"The decor of this restaurant is so authentic its bright and colorful. We ordered apple margaritas they were delicious instead of salt they honored our request to put sugar on the rim. For the entrees we ordered chicken,  shrimp and steak quesidillas they were delicious and flavorful. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Waitstaff was very attentive."}
{"text":"My husband will punch me in the face for saying this (no, jk, no spousal abuse here).    This place is okay, I guess?  But...meh.  (I now nervously checking husbands demeanor...ok...I can proceed.)  He loves it.  He loves it with all his heart and he yells 'BLASPHEMY' every time I say I don't wanna go.  So you can take that as you will.  But me, I don't like rice, nor beans, and these two side items come with EVERYTHING.  And there are not suitable replacements nor will they let you substitute.  So I pay $12 for a stinking enchilada and leave half my food on my plate. Sorry, but for me, it's not worth it.    I know I may be weird, but get some better sides - like corn bread or chips and salsa or corn...something...and I could be convinced to like this place."}
{"text":"Having lived in Pittsburgh for almost a year, I've still been on the hunt for a Mexican restaurant to call my staple \"go-to.\" Mad mex, steel cactus, and chipotle just weren't cutting it. Closest had to be los cabos in lawrenceville but you order at a front counter so it didn't have that authentic restaurant feel. I was SOSO excited when I saw that a new Mexican place was coming!   First impression was that this place is huge! Could easily get lost. The chips were good, salsa was pretty tasty, always a plus. I ordered the chicken fajitas and my husband got the enchiladas supremas. Everything was pretty good. My portion was huge and quite tasty, enough to take home. The reason I'm deducting one star is that in our favorite Mexican restaurant in my husband's home town, most entrees are served with rice, beans, guac, pico, and sour cream. Here, very few entrees came with those fixins for what was still a relatively pricey meal. Very tasty otherwise and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"16$ for burrito.....?!? I've payed 16$ for burrito that was disgusting. Bartender was s cool guy, i've ordered chicken fajita burrito and the guy told me straight that \" kitchen \" doesn't wanna put papers and onions in the burrito,i can get it on the side....WAUUU!!! REALLY???....like a sad guy was cool so i sad ok,they can put it on the side. Worst meal ever, chicken had no taste, rice was half frozen w no taste as well.....beans were fine thats a plus.  For the money i payed my meal was terrible!"}
{"text":"Completely blown away by the service. I don't claim to know what a typical experience at Patron is like, but I think this place deserves a glowing review for how they handled the large birthday dinner we thrusted on them.   + We had a reservation for around 20 people, and while I promise we are each wonderful as individuals... we can border on obnoxious when together as a group. Luckily, they seated us in a secluded corner of the restaurant at long chain of adjacent tables that managed to fit everyone. They are not low on space here. + As people trickled in over the course of maybe 40 minutes, the servers let us take our time to order and were incredibly patient. + Constant supply of chips and salsa is dangerously addictive. We never even needed to ask for more; they would just restock as we finished them.  + Food came out in a very reasonable time, with delicious and hearty portions for all. Honestly, after all the chips, my boyfriend and I were able to split a Patron Fajita for one and it was completely satisfying. + Servers were always polite, whether asking how things were or gently nudging in to take plates away. They also brought extra tortillas, extra plates, hot sauce when we asked. + Very accommodating for dietary restriction changes to meals. + They were able to split the check for each person like absolute WIZARDS (even accounting for items like margarita pitchers split 6 ways). That alone is pretty amazing, if you've ever been through the awful math of bill-splitting in huge groups. + Prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get.  Overall, it's such a fun place, and I personally loved the service and food. For a large group of friends or family, I highly recommend it! Four and a half stars. :)"}
{"text":"I LOVED the Patron location in Wexford, however it's a haul from the city, so I haven't been there in a long while. I was super excited when I saw they were opening up in East Liberty.   However, I was super disappointed when I visited this time. This place used to have the best homemade margarita's & guacamole around Pittsburgh. Not the case anymore! The margarita I got tasted like it came from a grocery store bottle. The guacamole was definitely not the chunky, homemade stuff that I have had before at this restaurant. It was smooth and blended up, like the stuff you get out of the grocery store premade packages. It didn't even have any cilantro in it. I think I'VE MADE BETTER guacamole than this! The chips seemed like they came from a bag too. I was so disappointed.  I got my usual menu item, the shrimp chimichanga, it was not as much of a disaster as the rest of the food and drinks where, however I could take it or leave it. My friends & I will unfortunately will not be back! What happened to this place????"}

{"text":"After living in Texas for twenty years I was skeptical of finding any good Mexican food in Pittsburgh. My husband finally convinced me to try Patron's. I tried to give it a fair shot but it was an all around disappointment. Food was bland and tasted like a frozen entree, the music was way too loud and when we ordered sopapillas, I couldn't really identify what arrived at our table. Twenty years of eating authentic sopapillas with honey in Texas, the flat crisp tortilla drizzled with chocolate that we were served were, I don't know what, bizarre? Definitely not sopapillas and didn't even taste good. Still looking for a premiere Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh along the lines of a Cantina Laredo in Dallas."}
{"text":"Imagine a sit down version of Taco Bell and you have captured the food quality of this place."}
{"text":"Went to Patron's for lunch. It is your standard issue Mexican joint. Pretty good overall. Had the taco and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in for a quick drink as well as an appetizer. She got a red sangria which was over iced with barely anything in the drink. I got the chicken and cheese quesadillas which were practically cold but I ate them because I was famished. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"I'm honestly shocked at how poor the reviews are and how few stars this place is getting. I've NEVER had an issue here, but to be fair I've only ever dined in the restaurant for lunch and dinner.  Pros: -I've never had to wait for seating -Within 2mins of sitting down I have chips, salsa, and a drink order placed if not filled -I never feel rushed by the servers who are always very helpful -The drinks are good, STRONG (you probably don't need that double you thought about) and don't take long to get to you -The food is all authentic Mexican cuisine and is probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh to date. Always served hot and quickly -Prices aren't the lowest, but they're far from unfair  Cons: -The TVs can be hard to see from some seats -Chips can be a bit greasy -Tables have designs on them that can make setting a glass down seem a little more treacherous than it should be  I go here all the time and I'd suggest it to anyone looking for Mexican food beyond Taco Bell and whatever Chili's decides to throw on a quesadilla."}
{"text":"muy excelente.... I drive from Moon Twp for this place. Great service everytime always welcoming for big groups, the dish I get Shrimp with Chrizo and jalapeno's is the best. recommend every chance I get."}
{"text":"Very good food and unique atmosphere. If you haven't been here stop in just to see the inside. Stay for the food. They serve authentic Mexican food with some of the Mexican/American foods so if you don't like authentic there's plenty of other things to try. Nice prices as well."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here for their Monday night taco night.  Patron is a fairly typical Mexican restaurant with the decor.  They have a couple of TVs around to watch some sports and are typically are packed on Mondays for dinner with a little bit of a wait time.  The restaurant can get loud inside so it can be hard to carry on conversations when it's busier.  This is one place that is OK to bring your kids and not have to worry.    After you are seated you are brought free chips and dip.  I like that the dip comes in a larger container and you are given separate bowls to pour dip for yourself and you don't have to share.  Their homemade salsa is one of the best I've ever had!  I usually get the hard taco special.  Both the beef and the chicken are fantastic, and come with cheese and lettuce.  They are definitely a step up from the typical hard taco and you can't beat it for the price.  Their lime margaritas are pretty tasty as well and would recommend them.  The staff does seems a little overworked as they don't spend much time at the table and aren't as friendly or accommodating as others.    Decent tacos and dip for a good price. It's really hard to beat their Monday night taco deal and I'll continue coming back here for it."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times. It's not my favorite Mexican restaurant by any stretch. But it's solidly average, it's close to my house, and sometimes I'm wildly lazy and don't feel like trekking far to stuff my face with copious amounts of free chips. So I keep slinking back to Patron for an adequate but not outstanding meal.  The first few times I went here, I sampled several chicken dishes that had their shredded, seasoned chicken in them (e.g., chicken flautas, chicken enchiladas). I found the texture of the shredded meat to be tough, stringy and chewy -- very off putting. So I started steering clear of anything with the shredded meat, and now I usually get their \"pollo amigo\" entree, which consists of chicken breast strips over a bed of rice topped with their cheese sauce. It's fairly tasty (the meat in this dish doesn't have any texture issues), although they could stand to be more generous with the cheese sauce. It's not overly spiced or flavorful, but it's generally decent (and that's pretty much how I would describe everything I've ever eaten here -- decent but not amazing).  Service can be hit or miss depending on what section you're in. I've always been seated right away (it's rarely busy in there), and free chips and salsa have always been delivered to our table with haste.  But beyond that, you can't always count on your server to promptly take your order, fill your drink, or check up on you with any regularity. It just really depends on the day.  Given the food quality and service, I think that they are probably priced on the high side. But like I said, when a craving for Mexican food strikes, they'll get the job done adequately."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time on July 16th with my wife as a birthday present. We were greeted and seat almost right away. Sat down in a colorful booth with one side a design of a small village. The other side a Aztec mask. All the tables and chair were very nicely design like this. The design of the Patron, and the menu felt like a authentic Mexican restaurant. The menu had a lot of different variety of burritos, tacos, quesadillas and other Mexican foods. I got the Fiesta burrito with steak and my wife got the Fiesta burrito with chicken. As we were waiting for are meals, they gave use nachos with salsa. When we waited 10-15mins and then got are food. The burrito came with bean dip, rice and sour cream with the burrito. The burrito was so great, taste very flavorful, very big too. For the amount food you got for the price was a good deal. About 11 dollars per meal. There was no problems with Patron. The service was average. I can't wait to come back to Patron."}
{"text":"Get the choripollo.  You will not be sorry.  Great food and great hospitality.   My husband and I are picky Mexican food people and we loved it!"}
{"text":"The service was just alright and the food was served lukewarm/cold and not good quality. My husband said his was much smaller portion than Emiliano's. They have Nowait app which I looked at in advance and it said \"Come On In\" and when we did it was a 20 minute wait. I noticed while eating they were slow to bus tables while people were waiting. For birthdays they beat a bucket that was dirty inside super loudly. Interior needs some attention - particularly bathroom. My order came incorrect. With so many awesome food choices around, we don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"The Wait: The hostess were ill mannered and slow. We were never greeted upon entering. The hostess stood in front of us and was too busy gathering menus and starring at everything but me and my friend.   Service: The servers were AMAZING. They completely made up for the poor hostesses. When we were finally seated it took less than a minute for us to get the chips and salsa. Right after drinks were placed and orders in. Before we finished our bowl of chips..the main course arrived. Drinks were never half empty. The servers were not only efficient but very genuinely friendly.   Food: LEGIT. That's all I have to say. I live in Pittsburgh but this will be my go to mexican restaurant. I'm from California and I can honestly say that the food here does remind me of home.   Decor: Loud."}
{"text":"Most people won't notice, but our kitchen at home has been torn apart to be remodeled for over a month, thus the writing of several reviews. NO appliances for my wife to cook her delicious meals. So we've been eating out almost every other night and the in-between days we have leftovers from the night before. So our local restaurants have been seeing a lot of us. Patron's has one dish in particular that we love and split because it is sooo hardy. It's their chicken, shrimp and vegetable soup!! The soup comes with about 6 nice sized shrimp, genuine white meat chicken, chocked full of veggies such as broccoli, cauliflower, squash and carrots. You don't know whether you should eat with a fork or spoon. The flavors are great and in the cold of this brutal winter, this is just a great meal...especially if you add a fresh Margarita to your bill of fare."}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just want a decent burrito for a good price, without going to a massive chain. Patron Mexican Grill fits the bill.  The decor is a little over-the-top, and the restaurant itself is cavernous.  I've never seen it full, so it should be easy to walk in and get seated.    The servers are very friendly and attentive.  I ordered a chimichanga off the special fast lunch specials, and indeed, it came out lightning fast.  I also got a basic margarita that was fine.    This is not that special place to take out of town guests, but the portions are large and the food is tasty enough."}
{"text":"Took advantage of the Tuesday night special - $4 sangria, $3 burritos. Both items were good and a good value for the price. Complimentary chips and salsa on the table is a great perk. The manager introduced himself on our way out of the restaurant and the wait staff was all friendly and prompt. Our server split our checks for our group without batting an eyelash. Looking forward to trying more dishes here."}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere with decent Mexican food. Always have had something tasty.  Post gazette gave the downtown location a terrible review.  Never walked out complaining."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and were greeted immediately asked our drink order and if we needed menus, also promised chips n salsa , unfortunately it went downhill fast from there. Bartender took our drink order which we received 20 minutes later ( bar only had 5 patrons including us) still no chips n salsa.  She was very busy socializing with her apparent regulars.  We than waited an additional 15 minutes for her to take our food order still no chips n salsa...I was starving and getting \"hangry\" , we asked about them she said oh sorry I always forget them?  Comes back again 10 minutes later to get us another drink , we than reminded her chips n salsa? I explained this time I wouldn't be able to drink my beer without some food... lol  The bar itself was messy and bartop was sticky and unkept. Needless to say food was underwhelming and we left immediately after eating."}
{"text":"Me gusta Patron's!  Just so happened to drop in on a Sunday for the buffet at Monroeville.  Ample selection of tex-mex on the buffet line.  Very reasonably priced at less than $9 per person.  Friendly staff and a never ending glass of sweet tea as the staff are very attentive.   Fox Chapel has the same service but I don't think there is a Sunday buffet.  But service is great, very little wait time to get your food, and it's piping hot and fresh!  Wash it all down witih a margarita!   If they had homemade tortillas, this places would get a 5."}
{"text":"Festive Mexican food place.  There aren't many Mexican places in Pittsburgh, so Patron has a decent rep. However, their menu is crazy, and they don't execute their dishes as well as you'd expect.  Table guacamole is always good, but they aren't too generous here. I loved the strong acidic lime touch to the guac, more than other places do, but I felt that the supporting cast of the diced veggies fell short.  As for the entrees, everything was pretty standard. The meat was pretty mediocre, except for maybe their ground beef, which I enjoyed a lot---until it got too salty. Their steak mexicano was a total disappointment---just a really thinly sliced and cheap tbone cut.   The fish was surprisingly good, so I have to give a thumbs up to that. However, all the surrounding elements: rice, beans, veggies...weren't great either. They felt more like filler than part of the meal.  Overall, pretty average place. Everything else about the place is decent. The food just falls short."}
{"text":"Went with some awesome industry folks to check out Patron last night - SUPER fun environment, and I felt like I was legitimately in Mexico again! YAY!   Great frozen margaritas, and the Enchiladas Mexicanas were a big hit among us.   PLUS! Free chips & salsa! We all agreed that there really isn't anything better than that.  That staff is fun and friendly, and they have a nice variety of tequila (naturally). Definitely a great addition to E. Lib.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to Patron for the first time last night. We both enjoyed the food and the service was excellent. It's disappointing to read all the negative reviews. Especially from people who grew up in parts of the country that offer \"out of this world\" Mexican food. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and have had some of the best authentic Mexican food in the country.  The manager is open to constructive criticism and is making changes. They are adding different items and taking a look at whats not working.  I think Patron is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Pittsburgh and will continue to get better."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food.  This place is awesome. Would have gotten a 5 stars rating but the only thing wrong with the place was that the both we where siting at was a bit uncomfortable other than that the food was excellent and the service was just as good. We got there around 4 and got seated right away. I pass the restaurant a lot of times pass the 5 o'clock time and the parking lot is packed. So if your hungry and love Mexican food stop in but stop in early. One last thing: the price isn't to bad. 2 of us eating and I love food so I can eat a lot of food and our bill was right around 46 $ with tip. A definite return for this guy's family."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not great, not fantastic, but, not bad. The food came out quick, it was hot, and it had flavor to it. This is not authentic Mexican. I don't think it attempts to be. It is touristy Tex-Mex: Sizzling Fajitas and such. They don't skimp on the tequila in the margaritas, and the service is quick and friendly. I'm surprised more people don't come here to start to get their drink on on a Saturday night, as it would be ideal for that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went to dinner with here on a business trip in Pittsburgh, I ordered the chili colorado. It was the most authentic Mexican food I have had in years. The service was great, prompt service and our glasses were never empty! The decor was very bright and fun. I would recommend going back."}
{"text":"Food is great, some of the best tacos I've ever had. Can't beat $1 taco night on Mondays. Service is always very quick too."}
{"text":"Patron is a pretty standard Mexican restaurant. Nothing super special, but the food is good and the service is alright, although I will say they brought out the food pretty quickly.  I love how colorful the restaurant itself is. Lots of brightly colored things all around. And of course, you get free chips and salsa. Great deals throughout the week too!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to come for quantity and drinks. If you're hungry and not willing to spend a fortune, you can get pretty full from ordering - dish around $10 here. I ordered the chicken chimichanga off the a la carte menu ($5) and my friend had the veggie fajita ($14?) and a $25 margarita pitcher for the table, we both could not finish our meals. Patron's does a good job of filling up its patrons with free chips and salsa. Everyone gets their personal salsa bowl and every two people share a basket of tortilla chips. These alone are pretty filling. Adding a $2.50 side of guacamole and our individual orders, we ended up bringing our leftovers home! The drink wasn't too strong but wasn't overtly sweet either. The food wasn't fantastic, but was filling and savory. It was a good combination and experience.  I want to come here to try their $1 tacos and $3 margaritas on Mondays! But I definitely know that this place is one for quantity not quality. It's an affordable place to fill your stomachs."}
{"text":"IT'S ABOUT TIME I find a Mexican restaurant that sells MEXICAN FOOD (and actually tastes good too). I tried the Bahia fish and it was delicious! I've had nothing but bad experiences at Mexican restaurants in Pennsylvania (especially the area I currently reside in). I'm not much on anything regarding customer service or ambiance (food speaks louder that stools), however, the place is nice and their server/waiter \"Nate\" was pretty cool. The only complaint(s) I have is that they don't serve Horchata and the other complaint was that they served me wuss sauce (hot sauce for sissies). Nate informed me why (which I kinda knew why) went to the back (with an I'll show YOU attitude) and came back with two jars of make ME sweat hot sauces!!! I'd come back again weekly ....IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO DRIVE FOUR HOURS to get there!!!"}
{"text":"3 stars isn't a punishment. 3 stars means it was fine, but nothing to write home about.   My food was good. I got the chimichanga dinner and it arrived as it should have. My wife's burrito was dry, she said. The margaritas were good. The best part of the meal was the salsa. Most places don't have any heat, but the salsa here had a little spice to it.   We shared a fried ice cream which was really good.   Where the place failed most was the service. Our server seemed rushed and wasn't that attentive. They were busy, but I'm not paying for other peoples service, so that's not an excuse to be sparse in your appearances.   As far as the decor and ambience: standard fair. I'd go back if I passed it, but I won't go out of my way.   Felt it was a little pricey for what you got, as well."}
{"text":"I love the decor -- bright colors all around and the table and chairs are highly decorative.  The staff was polite, friendly, and efficient.  The menu, while looking extensive, was missing any pork enchiladas.  Drat!  I ordered steak fajitas instead and a margarita.  Both were good but, honestly, how could you mess up a fajita, anyways.  The sides were the standard rice and refried beans.  It comes with complimentary chips and salsa.  The salsa was run-of-the-mill salsa.  So, all in all, I liked the decor the best.  The rest was satisfactory, just not stellar."}
{"text":"So.. I don't likes Mexican food... but I came here with my friends cause I wasn't that hungry so I wouldn't have to eat much.  So.. I got the chicken wings and spinach dip. The wings were alright. There was a bit too much sauce on them and eventually my hands got too slippery to eat them like a normal human being. Also, my spinach dip never came... so... that kind of sucked.  My friends got a burrito and a fajita. IDK! I don't know if it's because I never eat Mexican food, but the way the food comes out looks so unappetizing and unaesthetically pleasing. Maybe it's supposed to look like that?"}
{"text":"Usually exceptional customer service and awesome Mexican food in an authentic feeling environment.  Sit at the bar in the back and watch the game or whatever, the bartenders are great, pour a stiff margarita, and are friendly as can be. Tip them well.  Currently my favorite Mexican place in the city."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's the heart of Mexican food with the beat of Pittsburgh. When you enter the restaurant you are greeted with a very pleasant welcome and photos on the wall with some of Pittsburgh's most familiar faces. I was with a large group of co workers. The table is greeted with complimentary chips and salsa that are absolutely delicious! We were serviced in a decent time. Fyi, I am a time fanatic when it comes to my food. I ordered a margarita on the rocks, and the chimichanga. Everything was absolutely delicious. And all of my co workers were thoroughly pleases with their drinks and meal. And you can't beat great service where the waiter seems enthusiastic and friendly. We also enjoyed celebrating with the other tables birthday festivities.  This is a fun place to come to. I have been here before a couple years ago for Cinco de Mayo, and again it was such a great time but extremely busy. So beware if you plan to come on that day. But I promise you, that you will have a great time!"}
{"text":"I ate here once with my cousin it was decent I got a shrimp quesadilla it was average nothing too special. The decor in the restaurant is pretty neat. It's not authentic Mexican food in my opinion it is definitely Americanized. I personally wouldn't go back again it just wasn't for me I like more authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"The staff were not very attentive for our family. Not greeted at the door, and the server kept leaving our table before we could request what we needed. However Most of our food came out as requested and was enjoyed by everyone."}
{"text":"The absolute fastest service ever.  Good food and friendly staff, and extremely quick.  Great place to stop for a good, fast lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped by today. I was not impressed with the food. I had the Patron fajitas, they had absolutely no seasonings. Service was good. We have eaten at patrons in Monroeville and the food was very good. I will not go back to the O'Hara patrons."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Mexican on either side of the Mississippi.  The salsa at patrons is the best salsa in the United States.  $1 taco night is a great deal.  The chimichanga is one of their best dishes.  Recommend over any Mexican restaurant in the world."}
{"text":"I was excited that Patron was moving in nearby to where I live however I am ready for them to close and make room for something better.  I was afraid my review would be harsh but every day when I walk by and see the restaurant vacant I'm guessing that there are many others out there who share my opinion.  First off, I expected good salsa.  I have no doubt that the salsa came from a wholesale jug.   The chips that accompanied the salsa clearly came out of a box and were disgusting.  I would have rather gone across the street to Chipotle for chips and salsa.    I ordered a quesadilla for dinner which was lackluster similar to the overall experience.  This place needs a new menu or at least a chef who understands Mexican beyond prepackaged prepared goods.  Overall I would suggest walking up the street to Mad Mex or go to Chipotle and save some money.  Patron is just not worth it."}
{"text":"If you want AUTHENTIC Mexican food this is the place! Great food that is always spiced just right, juicy meat, nothing is dryed out or old looking, very fresh and yummy! I love the Patron Sampler and get it for my entre,  great service every time we go! This is the real deal. We love the hand carved chairs, tables and booths! So friendly and always smiling!"}
{"text":"Service and food was great. We had a good experience here, specially after taking a few shots and beers lol.."}
{"text":"We have a Patron near us in Wexford but we happened to be in Monroeville so decided we would stop in.  The service was excellent!  I wish I could remember the server's name but he was really good.    Then came the surprising part...the food at this Patron was so much better than the one in Wexford.  I had a chicken burrito that was outstanding!  The chicken was tender and had wonderful flavor!  My wife had a steak burrito which was not a good as the chicken (we both agreed) but it was very good as well.  I highly recommend this location and will eat there again when in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been to patron several times and have always had a good experience. Service was fantastic and staff is friendly. The first time I went my friend got the grande burrito which was HUGE....we could have split it and both been satisfied. I got the enchiladas which were good too. Chips and salsa are free and chips are served warm. They have the thin salsa which I Iike, but after going there several times, I always order the fiesta dip which is made of queso, beef, beans, and salsa....So good!!!! Only been there for lunch once and got the $6.99 chimichanga...;done to perfection and I only ate one of the chimis and had the other leftover. Monday and Tuesdays I believe they have $5 margarita pitchers. Let me just say- they do NOT cheap out on the tequila just because it's a special....me and my friend (regular drinkers) were definitely drunk after half a pitcher. Definitely recommend- oh, and the chicken nachos are amazing.....enough for two people to split and be full."}
{"text":"I usually get the enchilada suizas (literally the reason I come here!) but tonight I decided to switch it up and try the enchiladas Mexicanos! They were fantastic and definitely my new favorite menu item!!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this restaurant...Food was very tasty and service was friendly and fast...generous portions and great salsa and chips...Love the margaritas too... However, I don't recommend their \"flan\" (it's a desert) because it's not well cooked...I have tried it several times but it's always undercooked..."}
{"text":"Loved the food. They serve chips and salsa as soon as you come in, and that makes you super full. I ate one enchilada and packed the rest up! The setup inside is very colorful and lively. Staff is sweet and service is quick."}
{"text":"Best chimichanga.  The margaritas were awesome, the staff friendly and attentive.  I loved this place.  The only thing I didn't like were the beans, but then I do not like pinto beans...."}
{"text":"Went to Patron for lunch and was surprised by the bright festival atmosphere.  Great lunch vibe that I'm not sure would translate well to a dinner vibe, it's THAT colorful and playful.  Service was excellent and attentive.  Friends both had chimichanga and reported that they were flavorful and tasty.  I cannot remember what I had, but know that it was good, no complaints.  Here's what I definitely remember:  The taco salad that was served to our neighbors looked fantastic.  So I was suffering from menu remorse.  Next time I'll certainly try the taco salad.  Due to the daylight décor, it will certainly be lunch and not dinner."}
{"text":"2 for $20 deal going on here! Not that i ordered it because it was lunch and i had a coupon only good for $8 but this is a pretty awesome deal anywhere you go, just make sure you order water to keep the cost down. So on to the review...  This place is popping with color and decorations of authentic mexican life and culture. So many reds, oranges, blues, yellows you name it, they had it! Our booth was decorated so festively with one back rest being a mask with what looked like feathers and the other was a man working on a farm during the day. The designs were so outstanding you almost forget your at a restaurant. It was practically a hispanic art gallery aside from few sculptures.   So, we were greeted instantly upon entrance. Seated at the table of our choice and given menu. After we ordered our waters a young man brought up a basket of chips and salsa for munching. They have great salsa too, not too spicy not too mild but perfect for my taste buds. The chips were crispy and fresh witha slight buttery taste from the oil they are fried in. After a few minutes we ordered from the lunch menu.  They have lunch specials i might add for $5-$7 which is a great price but unfortunately we couldn't use the coupon on any of the specials. No big deal though. The lunch menu has plenty of items under $8 so it wasn't hard to choose. I ordered the taco salad and and chicken corn taco. My friend ordered a enchilada with extra onions and beans. Once the food came it was perfectly hot and nicely organized. The Taco salad was way bigger than I thought and i was a little upset that I ordered the extra taco. I thought it would be smaller, like the size of a burrito but this shell was about 8 inches long and 3 inches wide and 5 inches high..It was full of plenty of shredded chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream. It comes with melted cheese but i decided to save on the calories.  Her dish looked good as well. It need a little extra sauce but it was just as hot and fresh as mine was. The taco shell was so light and crispy. I would break pieces off and top it with the salad mixture as if it were a dip and boy was that great. I ate my taco first which was a bad idea because I didn't have enough room to finish my taco salad :( Anywho, i managed to finish most of it but was sad that I had to throw some of it away. I was eating rather slow so the bottom of the shell got a little soggy by the time i got to the end of it.   The service was well too. Our waiter always brought us whatever we needed in a timely manner and never showed a hostile face. We made him run back so many times for water, napkins, extra sauce, extra chips you name it. But all in all he made us very comfy. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a fast, cheap meal with lots of flavor!!"}
{"text":"marg is great so far. women's bathroom is crazy.   needs it's own streetlight so you can turn without waiting on McKnight!!!"}
{"text":"Went with friends for dollar tacos and margaritas. The restaurant was very noisy and very busy, obviously since the food was cheap that night! The dollar beef taco I had was really good, I was pretty impressed! The mango margarita was pretty good too. I also ordered the Chorizopollo (flattened chicken topped with chorizo) which was nicely cooked, and lots of good flavor. (Enough leftovers to have for another meal).  Another favorite of ours is the Arroz con Pollo too. Good choice for mexican food in the suburbs of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's not particularly fancy, but the food is really good. The service is friendly and fast. And, it's much easier to get a table here than at nearby Mad Mex. We started coming here when we couldn't bear the line at Max Mex, but now we go here first. I won't say I'm an expert, but the food seems much closer to the Mexican food I've had in Texas/California. Their beer selection could use some work (standard Mexican beers), but nothing's perfect :)"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Southern California, 3rd generation Latina. My grandmother migrated to California early in her life, her home cooking will never compare. So, I have high expectations when it comes to any place claiming they serve Mexican food.  Unfortunately, the East Coast isn't blessed with authentic Mexican cuisine, especially not at this joint. \"El Patron,\" is only popular due to its crowd not knowing what actual authentic Mexican food tastes like and its obsession with sugary margaritas. I came down with food poisoning eating from here. I had ordered the \"Taquitos Mexicanos,\" in the steak version, their steak was dry and bland. The rice and beans that came with it was not fresh, the tortillas that wrapped around said steak were not handmade and dipped to hell in oil, in order to fry. Dripped hot oil and made my entire plate greasy and soggy. Their house salsa is definitely canned and the chips are not made fresh. If you're interested in decent Mexican/American food paired with a real Margarita, check out Bakersfield downtown. I recommend trying their queso dip and fish tacos. Bakersfield actually hand makes their tortillas and the meat going into any of their dishes is fresh, moist, seasoned and cooked very well.  Or make the drive to the Brookline location for a little place called \"Las Palmas,\" their street tacos are absolutely delicious and authentic, my Mexican mother swears by it.  Moe's Southwest Grille tastes better than this junk, such a disappointment and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was my first time in this place since I am new to the area. The food was amazing as well as the service. We didn't wait long from the time we ordered until we received our food. Definitely a place that I will come back to. Loved seeing numerous steeler players pics surrounding the front of the restaurant. Hoping next time I can run into one of them, lol!"}
{"text":"Place is awesome. We came in at about 5 and were seated quickly. The waitress was nice and friendly but a little hard to understand. The food came out super fast and the portions were wild. I had the combo deal and got 4 entrees and it was enormous. If you're thinking about going to mad mex, dont. This place is better."}
{"text":"I must begin by stating that the 3 STARS go primarily to the service of Patron. I ordered carry out and the gentleman who answered the phone was extremely friendly and attentive. He got the order down correctly and was able to accommodate to what I wanted. The food didn't take much to prepare but the parking getting in was terrible. I agree with others that the whole parking lot should be resurfaced. There were so many pot holes and everyone just parked wherever they could, even blocking people in. Keep in mind this was a Saturday night. Being in the industry before this meant that they were busy because it's so dang good.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case. We ordered the shrimp fajitas which were bland. I mean the veggies were al dente and the shrimp simply sautéed. no flavor. The second option was a shrimp chimichanga which in my opinion didn't looked as appetizing but kind of was the average tasting dish. We also ordered a poblano relleno which in my opinion, and hear me on this, fabuloso cleaning soap. Yeah it was as if they cleaned the fridge and kept the peppers in there for AWHILE. freezer burn and soap in your mouth isn't great. we didn't even eat it.   I have to give it to them that the presentation of the food for carry out is impressive. There was definitely some care when putting our containers together. At first glance everything looked like it was going to pop with flavor. Sadly it didn't match to that.  BIGGEST DOWNFALL: \"EXPENSIVE\"  don't get me wrong, I love spending money on quality and flavor but for two entrees and an a la carte item for nearly $50.  :0  Sorry Patron but I won't be back when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Patrons has been our families favorite since they've opened. The salsa is always top notch, service is fast and friendly. Monday's are great with dollar tack but expect a long line. My favorite is chipotle shrimp. Order it with some flour tortillas, it beats any fajita dish at any chain. Also the enchilada dishes are excellent. Nice decor, it's a very unique environment. Great for families."}
{"text":"The real experience.  Stopped by Patron with a few work buddies and were looking for some good Mexican fare and beers. On that front we weren't disappointed.  The food was good. I had the steak chimichanga which was a good portion for the price and was quite tasty. The chips and salsa were also top notch. However when I ordered my second beer it never came. I waited 20 minutes and finally the server asked if I still wanted it. No thanks. Also I think their A/C was broken because we were all sweaty and ready to go. Good food. Subpar service. Bad atmosphere."}
{"text":"20140730  update  After being unable to figure out what NOLA on the Square was doing for a \"Hot Sauce\" event (see separate review), we went to Patron's Mexican Grill.  We and many others were there over the weekend and had an excellent time.  This go-round, we sat in a duo booth area by the entrance way.  Waiter was immediate; water and drinks immediate;  chips immediate.  The place was not as packed as over the weekend but a very substantial crowd.  Orders placed and executed quickly (their su chef system is remarkable).  I was talked out of one order of extra jalepino's as the waiter knew it would be too much, and he was correct.    Food way more than we could eat (though we tried).  On-tap Mexican beers -- nice to have a choice of something that isn't so hopped as to force your toes to curl up into your shoes on initial tasting.  Patron's has 3 outlets per my quick www search by the way.  Nice dinner, quick and accurate check, lots to take home for this evening.  And NOLA on the Square simply missed out on cash in the pocket by being unable to answer a simple telephone inquiry about the evening's food event.  An aside:  I've read all the reviews about the Wexford place -- and some are not very good; as of yet, I do not have that experience with the hostesses, wait staff and food.  f8 and be there (and we were)."}
{"text":"I recently ate at Patron and have to say I wasn't impressed. I went with two of my friends and we all ordered fajita dishes. I had the Shrimp Fajita, all the shrimp were small and just tasteless (most likely frozen) and the vegetables added no flavor to the dish. There were no sauces readily available at the table and the fajitas were served without cheese.   The worst part were the prices. My Fajita was $15.99 and certainly wasn't worth anywhere near that. You're better off going to Mad Mex or even Chili's for a better and cheaper experience."}
{"text":"Good place to go when you want to enjoy the Mexican fare we all are used to. The service is always prompt and attentive. The food is standard American impression Mexican...what most people expect and want....but not the real fresh and truly authentic spicey wonders you can experience if you really seek out the authentic purveyors... My son and I enjoy coming here, and the staff are well trained, the food always hot and served promptly. The prices are very reasonable. Clean the place up a bit more, and it'd get that last star."}
{"text":"Came here and immediately regret it! The guacamole was the same cheap pasty kind you can get at any hole in the wall mexican place, the prices are insanely overpriced! I paid 6 bucks for a tiny kids size quesadilla! They also have zero customer service! So mad i wasted my time and money here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the restaurant and ordered their food via GrubHub. Both were excellent. Shrimp tacos, shrimp were fresh and tasty. Chicken tacos, pretty traditional and good plus chips with queso and salsa. Salsa isn't the super chunky kind, and it isn't super spicy. All and all, always a great choice over a chain!"}
{"text":"The guacamole wasn't fresh or homemade with was a huge disappointment, The house margarita was clearly a pre-made mixture, which tasted like juice. However, the staff was pretty friendly."}
{"text":"1st time to this restaurant . I should have known this was not going to be a good experience from the get go. The menus have things marked out my marker. Ok one item I get. Numerous items I do not.The sign with the hours was digital but have a paper over one of the time instead of changing it. These little things point to if a business takes care of the small things. Ok one item I get. Numerous items I do not. The best part was the queso. The tacos were bland. The rice ..... Bland. The decor was nice but past that not much else, 1st and last time to this place."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying Patron's Mex Grill, Authentic Mexican states the sign.  Like to try Mexican restaurants and wanted to compare to some little Taco shops that I have tried.  Patron's is more of a full menu restaurant, with a Bar at the far end of the building, not a Taco Shop.  Patron's booths and walls all have some bright colors and there are a few Mexican paintings.    Service was good and fast.  Immediately received some fresh chips and salsa that was a little hotter than most Mexican places, very enjoyable.  Ordered a chicken burrito that comes with rice and refried beans.   Unfortunately, the rice tasted like it had been in a steamer a little to long and the chicken burrito was not very flavorful.    The restaurant has a TV with a spanish station playing but the sound was not on.  However some music was being played in the restaurant, a little to load, but to make matters worse, the kitchen was blasting a radio and it interfered with the restaurant music and our conversation."}
{"text":"Really nice place happy hour here is amazing, but when it switches back to normal prices it gets a little pricey. I would recommend going and trying it out for yourself ! Monday is the best day !"}
{"text":"$1 tacos? Don't mind if I do. Found a hightop table during happy hour before it started to pick up. The general dining area was about full except for about 3 or 4 larger tables. Our waiter was easily the most pleasant one I've had since I could remember and the tacos were amazing! Free chips and salsa are always a bonus. Mondays $3 margaritas are a crowd pleaser too. Patron is the place to be for tacos on Mondays!"}
{"text":"Amazingly authentic Mexican food. Friendly and helpful staff. Odd ladies room."}
{"text":"We had great service from our waiter; he was very attentive and friendly.  The margaritas (Silver Patron) was excellent!   We ordered enchiladas and burritos both of which were served hot and taste was both authentic and flavorful."}
{"text":"I was super excited when I saw another Mexican restaurant opening up near me. Mad Mex is great, but can get a little repetitive. Patron has much more variety and everything I've had has been super good. I was a little worried about the bad Yelp reviews, but one try was all it took to change my mind.   I've been here three times now, twice with my boyfriend and once with friends. Their margaritas are awesome, especially if you get one made with one of the premium tequilas off of their pretty impressive tequila list. The sangria is also nice and fruity and is pretty strong - none of that watered down stuff!   The guacamole Patron is also delicious. I'm so glad I found a Mexican place that does guacamole right! Plus, there's unlimited chips and salsa, so you're not left with a whole bunch of guac and nothing to eat it with.   I've now tried the chimichanga, the enchiladas, and the chicken fajitas - all excellent, though probably not so excellent for my waistline. I also always have enough leftovers for a good sized lunch the next day.  All of the servers I've had have been extremely attentive and helpful, and the manager even stopped by a few times to ask us how everything was. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very good...entertaining. The food was not bad...but nothing that stood out. The service was very good, so no complaints at all there. I will revisit in the future, but not something I would schedule for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I LOVE Patron Mexican Grill.  I love the food and the service doesn't get any better.  Everyone is beyond friendly and always ready to get you anything you need.  You are greeted with salsa and chips, and I suggest getting the fiesta dip.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  My favorite entree is the Patron fajitas.  It comes with shrimp, chicken, beef, and grilled green peppers and onions.  The dish comes with rice, beans, lettuce, etc on the side.  I am usually at a Patron's at least once a week to get my fix.     The Monroeville location has a buffet on Sunday, not sure of time, but it's a chance to sample most everything on the menu.    The decor is very bright and Mexcian oriented.  This is a great time for a party, a family, a date, or just to eat."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 3 years and I am never disappointed.  From the mango margaritas to the patron fajitas, everything is excellent.  The staff is the friendliest and most attentive that I have experienced in any restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the 4th Patron Mexican Grill to open in the area. It is the largest of the restaurants and the most beautiful. The service is impeccable at all the Patron restaurants, and is no different here. We had the chori pollo, cheese enchiladas, shrimp and rice (the kids), queso and chorizo. Everything was cooked perfectly. There is not one thing that I can find wrong with this restaurant. The decor is just beautiful. I also had a frozen raspberry margarita that came in a ceramic pottery glass. The margarita was absolutely delicious. Everything screams Mexico!  You have to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Patron. Hands down my favorite Mexican place and has been since I was 8 years old. You absolutely must try the chicken fajitas. I've never had better chicken fajitas from anywhere. Super delicious and they always come out sizzling."}
{"text":"Pros: There's never a wait for a table; and, the chips and salsa are always fresh. Also, the wait staff and management are always incredibly friendly.  Cons: The service can be slow; and, I've had issues getting exactly what I ordered. I've both received simply the wrong food or the dish I wanted wasn't available.  Overall, Patron is a solidly average Mexican joint. I would rather spend a little less and grab lunch instead but the occasional Friday night family dinner is okay by me."}
{"text":"There food is average, I would say,  I did like there chips and salsa a lot.  I had chicken fajita the chicken didn't have much flavor, and a little dry. I think because of the location they don't get too busy, because on a saturaday they could sit us right away, so that was nice because I hate waiting for a table. I would go here again and try something different."}
{"text":"Opened in September 2007, it's taken me 6 months to come in for a try.  The flavors are authentic, the margaritas pack a punch and the prices are reasonable.  The restaurant is cute inside, filled with authentic art work, and hand-carved booths, tables and chairs imported from Mexico.  Owner Martin Bolanos operates three La Fiesta Mexican Grill restaurants in Chattanooga, TN.   I am not sure how he ended up with a restaurant in PA.  Acoustics wise, this place gets 1 star.  Host staff gets a -2.  But our server was great, although there seemed to be a tiny bit of a language barrier.  And the food was delicious, although it took a long time to pour over all the selections.  In the mean time, we stuffed ourselves full of the complimentary homemade chips and yummy hot salsa.  I finally decided on the camerones diablo, a dozen nice sized butterflied shrimp covered in a spicy red sauce, served with fluffy rice, pico de gallo and lettuce.  My handsome friend, the ever charming Robert had enchilada mexicanas; one chicken, one beef and one with beans.  All were topped with cheese, green sauce, red sauce and sour cream with rice and beans.  I had the usual strawberry margarita, although next time, I think I'll be adventuresome and try a mango or a watermelon.  Robert had some sort of Mexican beer.  We were too stuffed for dessert, although they serve the usual fried ice cream, sopilla and flan.  The place turned into a mad house before we left, apparently 6 o'clock is major chow time in Wexford.  The restaurant is very family friendly, kids everywhere."}
{"text":"I've been to the Patron Mexican Grill in Fox Chapel (or NEAR Fox Chapel - I wouldn't want to ruffle any bourgeois feathers by stating that a place 'outside' their gentrified borderlines was a part of THEIR community) and was actually quite impressed. The best Mexican food I've enjoyed in da burgh so far has been El Campesino, and Patron is pretty much an El Campesino clone. The food is made well, flavorful, fresh, prices are about the same, and the staff is friendly and helpful for the most part, with a dash of Latino eye candy thrown in occasionally.  I had heard that the Monroeville location offered a buffet, but frankly, I had a heck of a time finding out much about it. Not one word about it online, and even when I found them on Facebook, the person who runs their FB page didn't know anything about it. When I told them that the Fox Chapel (ish) store told me that Monroeville had one, the person looked into it, and confirmed, but that it is only on Sundays from 11 am to 2:30 pm.  So once it was confirmed, I thought 'Y'know, I've never HAD a Mexican buffet' and was kind of craving giving it an audition. My best friend decided that we were going to GO! So we scheduled her Access van, and off we went.  Patron has taken over the old Chili's building near Monroeville Mall - wait - wasn't Chili's like the ultimate suburbanite dream???  And it failed in MONROEVILLE?? But I digress.  We were greeted at the door by Latino Guapo, tall, dark and handsome, who started to seat us away from the buffet, and since I was plating up for a blind woman and myself, I asked to be seated close to the buffet. He changed direction, and we were seated next to the buffet.  The restaurant is quite large, very colorful in that Latin way, lots of neon, the Mariachi flavored tunes filling the air.  Of course, for da burgh-ites, they also have several TVs hanging around the restaurant with ESPN sports news. *sigh*  Now, I knew what their regular menu was like, and have always enjoyed it, and as I've stated, I've never been to a Mexican buffet before, so here it is, the buffet.  VERY basic, a little bland, but filling.  Mexican restaurants I have always equated with Italian restaurants. At an Italian restaurant, you find three dozen ways to combine pasta, in a variety of shapes, with cheese, meet, and a handful of sauces.  Roll it and stuff it with cheese, top it with tomato sauce and voila Manicotti. Leave the noodle flat, stick the cheese and sauce in between the layers, and, voila - lasagna! Well, at a Mexican restaurant, you have basically two styles of tortillas, which you can roll, fold, or rip, to combine with beans, rice, meat, and cheese, sprinkled with a variety of veggies and a handful of sauces. Roll it and stuff it, and voila - burrito. Fold it and stuff it, and voila - taco! Rip it up, and scatter it around a plate, top it with all the goods, and voila - nachos.  The only real difference between ordering from the menu and having the buffet is that now the rolling, folding and stuffing becomes do it yourself, but with more bland and 'bulk' ingredients aimed at the trough-like palates of suburbanite Pittsburghers.  The parts are all there, they just aren't as flavorful as what would come out of the kitchen.  The buffet had spanish rice and refried beans, chicken and beef enchiladas, taquitos, fajita guts (one chicken, one beef), taco shells and a very bland ground beef for stuffing into burritos, or tacos, or sprinkling over your self-assembled nachos, a pan of hot white cheese sauce (a yinzer standing next to me in the line said 'what's THIS?' and I told him it was the cheese sauce - he then started to rant that he wanted to make sure it wasn't 'summa dat white gravy fer biscuits' - and I opted out of the chat.) There were also taco shells, warm tortillas in foil for making your burritos or fajitas, hot wings and ribs (??) another pan of some kind of softer mini-burrito stuffed with something, a cold 'topping' section with lettuce, pico de gallo, cold shredded cheese, and small containers of sour cream and guacamole. Finally, there was a small 'dessert' area with a warm banana stuffed tortilla, those crunchy cinnamon stick things whose name eludes me at this time, and a variety of cut up fruit.  Everything was basic.  Nothing was heavily seasoned or spiced, or especially flavorful. Even the hot wings (??) which were plump and juicy just had a tabasco like sauce, tasty but not challenging.  The guacamole was fine, the beans were fine, the rice was fine, the cheese sauce was fine.   But for an $8.99 all-you-can-eat buffet, 'fine' is just fine. I don't expect 'spectacular' when I can stuff myself.  Stuffing yourself with 'spectacular' is called 'brunch' and usually comes with a MUCH heftier price tag.  Give it a shot when you're in the mood for more than what would just come on a plate from the kitchen. It's 'fine'."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend and was pretty impressed by the food. I'm not a Mexican cuisine connoisseur, but I know the difference between authentic Mexican food and Chipotle. Patron's did the trick for me - my friend and I split the guac and chips (guac was fantastic) and I also had the Chicken Fajitas from their lunch menu. The portions are GIGANTIC, so I definitely couldn't finish it, but the overall experience was really nice. Ambience is very vibrant and colorful and loud and the service was nice. Also, the women's bathroom was ridiculously cool."}
{"text":"i'm honestly surprised how few stars this place is getting. i loved everything about it and the only thing that held me back from 5 stars was the chile relleno. let me explain. so, chile relleno's are my favorite mexican dish, but every restaurant does them differently, as try as i might, i can't help but judge a place by this dish. i do have this say, this was probably the worst one i've had. not inedible or anything, just not at all how i like the dish to be made. BUT the quesadilla i had as well was delicious and i gobbled up the whole thing.  i also had a yummy mango frozen margarita. the amount of different kinds of margaritas (different tequillas, different flavors, different styles) was surprising. i also love the atmosphere. when we first walked in, my friend said how her work friends like to go there when they're having a bad day because it's so cheerful. lots of colorful mexican art all over the tables, booths, chairs, everything. the bill was also relatively reasonable. on the high side of reasonable perhaps, but wouldn't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I thought the salsa and queso were very good. The guac needed salt. The chicken for the fajitas was so flavorful and tender. I also really enjoyed the Mexican rice and refried beans.  The margarita is nothing special, I would stick with the Mexican beer options. The sangria was too sweet for my taste.  Unfortunately, our server was awful. The table of four that sat down after us received their food before us (different server). (We were at a table consisting of 3 adults and 2 kids.) The server did not seem happy at all. At one point, she slammed drinks down which left us wondering if we did something wrong.  She never cleared any of our dirty dishes, when she did check on us which was maybe 2 times during the entire meal, she did not offer us refills on our drinks. And the food took forever. She seemed to have disappeared...maybe she was the outdoor seating server? This place overall is fine, but I hope I get a different server next time."}
{"text":"Great big place and I could see coming here if you have a big party and forgot to make reservations somewhere. The food, however, leaves a lot to be desired. I wouldn't consider it authentic. Also, we had to send some of our plates back because some where really hot while the others were freezing cold. My advice: get liquored up while waiting for your food."}
{"text":"The Monroeville location is much better than Fox Chapel.  attentive service,  colorful atmosphere,  good margaritas,  good portions of good food."}
{"text":"We were the only ones inside,  and had to get up twice to get someone to wait on us.  The food was good,  but with service like that...  monroeville location treated us much better."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love Patron. It is our most frequented restaurant in the North Hills. The staff is friendly, funny, prompt, and they always remember us. The food is fantastic and authentic. We have tried many different dishes and have never been disappointed. Patron is a no-brainer if you're looking for good Mexican food in the North Hills!"}
{"text":"We go here often with friends.  The chips and salsa are always good.  I always get the chicken chimichanga with rice.  It is always terrific!  The margaritas are the best I have had at a restaurant!  The wait staff is friendly and always attentive.  We are fans and will continue to go here for dinner."}
{"text":"Love love love Patron's! They have great food, an extensive menu, and kind servers. I go here about once a month and have been consistently wonderful. There is something for everyone, but I highly recommend the Polo Amigo! This rice and chicken dish is so good, and I usually have leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"On a positive, the food arrived quickly and was hot upon arrival. The salsa was also very good.  Unfortunately, this didn't hit the mark for me. I ordered the chile relleno, and nachos with black beans. My BF ordered chicken fajitas. The presentation was very poor(see pictures). The chile wasn't good. The chicken was tasteless and it was smothered in some type of white sauce that was also tasteless. Maybe if it was in a red sauce and the chicken had more flavoring (which I expected), it could have saved the dish - I actually tossed the majority in the trash. The bean nachos were good after I added shredded cheese on top from my fridge and the fixings from the fajita that I stole from my BF. The nachos came with a questionable sauce, beans, and chips (no sour cream, lettuce, pico, etc).   My BF thought the taste of the fajitas was okay... but the chicken was cut very oddly (small slivers). Didn't look very appetizing.  Don't think I'll return or recommend to others."}
{"text":"All in all, this place is an okay to grab some Mexican in East Liberty. You'll never leave hungry, and they've got some great specials (95 cent taco Mondays!). However, none of their food is particularly memorable, and their drinks aren't anything special (margiartia mix ftl). The service is fine. Again, all in all 3/5."}
{"text":"This place is SO FREAKING GOOD!!!!! If you're a Mexican food fan, you MUST try this place when you visit the North Hills!!!  I came here for lunch one day during the week, walking in around 2pm. Even at this sort of \"off\" hour for lunch, the line was out the door. Well worth the wait though. I ordered their Super Burrito, which came with beans, rice, and cheese, your choice of meat, guacamole, sour cream and salsa. The burrito is HUGE too. Your order even comes with a side of chips.  The total price was super cheap.  They also have your choice of soda and beer if your heart desires.   My food was amazing. One of the best burritos I've ever had. So flavorful and delicious. I was trying so hard to finish my whole burrito, but could only manage to eat about three fourths of it since it was so big.  The service here was great; however, the noise level here is high with plenty of screaming children.  What can you expect from PGH.     Overall, I really loved it here and would come here again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. They never get our order right. Several times we have all gotten stomach issues after eating here."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. I didn't really know what to expect, but I was pleased with my experience. Service was a tad bit slow, but it's a big restaurant so I understand. It's also a little more expensive than I think it should be. The upside to that is that the portions are big and you'll definitely be full when you walk out.   They start you out with chips and salsa, which are pretty good. If you order the guacamole then someone will come to your table and make it right in front of you. It isn't really a new idea, but I think it's a good one. I got the chicken chimichanga. It was amazing! My only complaint is that it wasn't larger. They give you a large portion in sides...stuff like lettuce, salsa, guac, rice, beans. I would recommend it for anyone looking for good Mexican food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"To be fair I've only come on Mondays for their $1 tacos and $3 margaritas. You get all the free chips and salsa you want while you wait at the table. The tacos are hard shell and you can choose between chicken and beef. Then for margaritas you can choice between having it frozen or on the rocks. If you want to choice a flavor of margarita it's $1 extra and I'd recommend the blue mango or the raspberry! This place can fill up quick on Mondays but you usually don't have to wait too long for a table."}
{"text":"We have visited this establishment a few times to satisfy our Mexican food cravings. There are plenty of Patrons out there and they are all very colorful and fun! Every single time, our service is so quick and they are so nice. I don't have much experience in authentic Mexican food, but I always think it's delish! You are provided with endless chips and salsa which is always a plus.  There's not much else to say! All in all a great place if you're craving this kind of food in Fox Chapel!"}
{"text":"Decent authentic Mexican food. Prices were reasonable and the atmosphere was fun. I think they were working on an outdoor seating area while I was there in late spring so that'll be a nice option this summer. I would go back!"}
{"text":"The food is consistent. The service is definitely not. I have eaten at Patron many times and the tacos, enchiladas, guacamole, and salsa are fantastic! The margaritas, specifically El Jeffe, are amazing!   Sometimes the food arrives alarmingly fast and we wonder how they possibly had time to cook it. Other times it's a 30 minute wait for the food."}
{"text":"Having just moved from Austin not too long ago, I was very much missing out on decent Tex/Mex in Pittsburgh. Mad Mex is... well its good, but its not even in the same genre. Lets just say, Chipotle was a welcome site - and that's hardly Mexican, either.  I was very excited to have this place open up in my neighborhood. Until I tried it.  Lets start with the good: * Decent salsa * Good guacamole (a pleasant surprise) * Warm tortilla chips * A nice clean, mildly-tacky-but-appropriately-so atmosphere  Now, the rest: * Margaritas were TERRIBLE. I'm sorry, you can't charge me $10 for a margarita and use a MIX in it! Are you kidding? Simple recipe: Tequila, fresh lime juice, cointreau or Patron Citronge or Gran Marnier or Paulas Texas Orange. This is not hard to do right. * Crispy shells everywhere on the menu. * No breakfast tacos offered * Veggie options were strange. Broccoli? Cauliflower? WHAT? Why not calabacitas? Sweet potato, grilled corn, rajas, nopales, caramelized onion, Mushrooms... Huitlacoche? So many better options than a salad bar shoulder shrug. * Limited salsas. No mole or tomatillo.  So, basically, this place has potential - but its going to take a complete menu/recipe/bar revamp before I'll consider returning."}
{"text":"My husband loves Mexican food and we eat at Mexican restaurants as much as possible. This is one of the better ones I have been to. Traditional atmosphere and very pleasant. Food came out nice and hot.  Cheese dip was the best and the tacos where excellent. Thank Carolina for wonderful service"}
{"text":"Delicioso hot salsa!!!  Chicken is not like the typical mexican juicy chicken, it is a little dryer, but in a good way.  It is very flavorful, love it.  Beans are a bit thick, but very tasty.  Ground Beef is a little dry and not that flavorful.  Restaurant is clean, and service was very attentive"}
{"text":"Went to Patron recently while visiting family in Pittsburgh. It was a Friday night and my sister, brother-in-law and I wanted a margarita. We had never been to Patron before but since it's within 5 minutes of my family's home, we decided to try it. Patron had great large margaritas, our server was really personable, and the decor is festive/colorful. I had the chicken enchiladas dish and while the dish was good, it wasn't the best dish I've ever had from a Mexican restaurant. The meal was very large so you definitely get a lot of food. Therefore, I think this restaurant is good if you want margaritas and an \"ok\" meal but it's not the restaurant I'd go to for the best Mexican in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Below average Mexican/Tex-Mex food.  We went once and everyone in our party agreed that the food just didn't hit the spot.  When the check came, the prices were a little higher than we anticipated and we felt we had wasted our money, especially with some good restaurants within walking distance for a comparable or cheaper price.  BRGR and Mad Mex come to mind.  To be honest, I would have rather gone to Chipotle around the corner."}
{"text":"First time here. Very impressive. Authentic decor and music. Not a fan of spicy food, but I was able to find something that was not spicy. Antonio  was our waiter. Very professional and knowledgeable. Would definitely ask for him on my next visit. Mid priced. Paid $16 for my entree. With 2 Coronas and tax was just under $28.  If you love Mexican food. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"When Taco Bell starts to sound appealing, you know something's not right. I'm always down for Mexican, but I'm not sure what I ate was Mexican food....or food in general.   Patron had me at free chips and salsa. The salsa turned out to be bland and watery, but I can't really complain about a freebie. The Wednesday special is $3.50 chimichangas (original price is $5 so not that much of a discount). Since I've never had a chimi before, I decided to go for it. The vegetarian chimi is basically a tortilla stuffed with refried beans then smothered in queso. It was awful. I gave them my hard earned money to eat a pile of mushed up beans. Everything they served tasted like it came straight from a can.   Before I rip this place apart further, I want to note that the staff were phenomenal. Truly the silver lining to an otherwise unpleasant experience. Our waiter was very friendly and cheerful. He checked in on us often and was very efficient when it came to refilling our waters and chips. That guy is the real MVP."}
{"text":"While Mad Mex is my favorite Mexican-adjacent restaurant in the city, sometimes it makes me think of the Onion headline \"Restaurant Gives Totally Unwanted Twist To Mexican Cuisine.\"  Sometimes I don't want a burrito infused with nine different cuisines, I just want Americanized Mexican food served with copious amounts of refried beans and rice. Patron is that, and it does it perfectly. Tons of vegetarian options, great happy hour specials (7 dollar giant margaritas on Saturdays!), and very friendly service which occasionally is lacking up the street with the tattoo crowd."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and it's always packed. The restaurant is very festive and food is served on Fiestaware; this is a bonus for collectors like me. The staff is always friendly and happy to serve. They never seem to lose their cool when its crowded. The chips and salsa are yummy and the entrees even better. The portions are enormous and enough for two meals or even sharing."}
{"text":"I hail from Washington, D.c. where great restaurants are commonplace. I just had a fabulous lunch today at Patron Mexican Grill. Enchiladas with black beans, rice and plentiful salsa. Best Mexican lunch I have had in many years!"}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious salsa. Flavorful guacamole...Would have gotten 5 stars if they didn't put salt on my margarita. Lol. I will definitely eat here again when visiting Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday night with my wife and another couple. We sat at the bar and were the only ones there. The location of this Patrone's is sort of out of the way in a small strip mall, which must hurt attendance because it's generally always slow when we go here. The bartender was nice and friendly, but would sometimes disappear for long periods. The free chips and salsa are always welcomed, but sometimes fill you up before your order. Our meals came out very quick and they are always consistent.   Pros: Never a wait and the food comes out quick. Friendly staff.   Cons: Atmosphere is below average due to location."}
{"text":"Came tonight hungry and ready for some decent Mexican food. Got myself and my guest on the waitlist. Is Yelp/No wait with a 13/23 min estimate. Once logged in it showed 8 in front of us. Got to the restaurant (parking is always a problem here) and checked in where the waithostess quoted me 40 min!  Luckily she was very wrong (it was only 5 min) and very gracious.  I ordered the triple combo (enchiladas, tamale and chile rellano), my guest got the kids burrito.  The tamale was pretty good with a spicy pork (could have used more sauce), the cheese enchiladas were ok too (I asked for green sauce). The cheese in both was a very mild queso.   The rellanos, however, were terrible. What's nice is that you get 2, but the cheese had a spoiled taste to it. Unfortunately, we had not seen our waitress since she took our order (someone else brought the food) and nearly 20 min passed before she checked in on us. When I told her about the rellanos and asked her to remove that portion from my check, she grabbed the passing by manager and asked him to do it.  I didn't see her again for quite some time (at which point I had to get my check from her because I was tired of waiting). She brought it and let me know they removed the rellanos and charged my for a double combo instead.   The manager never bothered to stop by. No other contact was made.  Hopefully she takes the $1 tip as a sign of her poor service.  And, more importantly, hopefully the next time a guest has a problem, the manager will be gracious enough to make a personal visit.   I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Dear Pittsburgh,   I'm very proud of you after waaay too many years of very limited options with respect to authentic mexican food you finally are getting with the program and attracting some worthwhile additions.  Ray Azteca just opened up in Penn Hills and I'm not sure how long this place has been here, but my first visit was last night.  I had a lot of fun here.  Mike, Jen, Jeebz and I went after watching the Pens open a \"can of wupass\" on the phillthy flyers and the place was packed.  However, we didn't have to wait.  As soon as you enter the foyer is filled with pictures of Steelers who seem to give their seal of approval.  The interior is very loud, but in a good way.  It's that type of white noise that actually allows for privacy with tables so close together.  The colors and decorations are what you'd expect.  Bright vibrant almost \"loud\" artwork and hand carved booths with folk running around.  We sat at a booth and were quickly greated by our server.  We started with the complimentary warm chips and plenty of semi spice fresh salsa.  We ordered a pitcher of margharitas, which were okay, but I prefer my tequila straight.  The menu is massive like most mexican joints.  We decided to start with the queso fundido, which is a queso dip topped with chorizo, bell peppers, tomatoes and onions.  It was delicious and served sizzling hot on a skillet.  It was supposed to be served with tortillas, but I guess the waiter forgot.   It wasn't a big deal because the dip was delicious with the chips.  I decided to keep it simple with respect to my dinner.  I find it best to try the staples with mexican places before getting adventorous on another visit.  We all did the combo specials which you can choose from 2 to 4 choices with either beef or chicken.  Jen had the combo 2 and the rest of us had the 3 combo for $8 and $10 respectively.  I had a 2 beef tacos and the chille relleno.  The dishes are served with the usual rice and beans, which I found to be really good.  I mean usually the rice and beans are not memorable, but these were good.  The tacos were good, not great but good.  There was plenty of seasoned beef, some lettuce and a few tomatoes.  I was a bit disappointed with the chille relleno which is a mild pepper stuffed with cheese and fried to a golden brown with a light breading.  The flavor was okay, but it was drowned in grease. I mean it is possible to get a fried item that isn't drowned in grease, right?  I tried a bite of Jeebz chicken burrito and it was really good.  The burrito was stuffed with great moist flavored chicken and I was a bit upset at myself for not getting this, next time... Our server was really good for the most part, except with the slip with the tortillas for the dip.  He kept calling us amigos' and seemed to be having fun.  A couple other things to consider.  I'd skip ordering the pitcher of margaritas and probably just stick to getting a single margarita with better quality tequila.  It's $.70 extra for sour cream which is pretty cheap.  Jen and I both got a side and the sides are huge.  We could have done just as well with one side for all four of us.  Overall a fun family friendly mexican restaurant in the North Hills.  El Camp' is still my current favorite, but they no longer hold a monopoly on the authentic mexican restaurant pittsburgh market.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great service and well above average food.  This is our favorite for Mexican Food in Monroeville.  These folks really care about the customer experience.   Food is delivered piping hot and is delicious."}
{"text":"very beautiful decor. friendly staff. greeted at the door with a smile. waiter was attentive and helpful. menu is massive. many choices. food is good. very nice experience"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican chain restaurants. Great Queso dip and the chicken quesadillas are awesome!  I usually stay away from chains but I like the taste of the food. The price is reasonable for what you get. Gotta say I love the cheese dip. Just spicy enough for my taste but not to spicy."}
{"text":"This is a solid and steady place that we go to regularly. They serve free unlimited chips and salsa that is great. Service is extremely fast and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food is hard to come by I'm Pittsburgh let alone Wexford. On the west coast this would be three stars, but here it is easily five. Friendly service and quality food with a few star entrees like the Chipotle chicken/seafood."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions and will keep coming back.  I came to Pittsburgh from CA so good Mexican food is hard to find.  Patron has done a good job and the food is very good.  The menu is extensive and the servers are knowledgeable and helpful.  The dining area is huge and very clean.  The bathrooms also clean both times we were there."}
{"text":"I love this place. Finally good mexican food. The guacamole patron was outstanding.  They made it exactly how I like it. My husband had a  traditional non alcoholic drink \"Horchata\" witch was to die for. I had a home made sangria and loved it. Not too sweet, that was just perfect.  Food was good I  dont like too spicy so they made it just right . Its about time they have vallet parking because the first time I was there it was had to find parking. I would definitely be back ."}
{"text":"I wish would could remember the server's name; she was excellent! The ambiance in the restaurant was good, too.   We got a pitcher of the house margaritas ($25 for 60oz - not bad!) and found it really delicious. I ordered the Patron Fajitas and my husband chose the Carne Asada. His meal came with what was essentially 3 petite steaks, while I was given what amounted a full piece of chicken, a petite steak, and 6 large shrimp. Plus all the extras. For the price, we were really happy with the portion size.   Both of us thought our meats were seasoned really well and all of the sides were delicious. We were given chips, salsa, and guacamole and enjoyed all of these as well.   In all, it was a great stop for lunch and we're really glad we tried it. Next time we'll bring the little one and see how the kid's menu holds up!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. The food is ok but overpriced $11 for three small fajita tacos no sides and they charged extra for some cilantro and cheese. Food was ok not memorable and certainly not worth the $ paid. Won't be back"}
