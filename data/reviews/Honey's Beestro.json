{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open for 2 years.  What a disappointment, I really wanted to like it because I love the locations.  I wouldn't even care if the food was bad if the service was any good.  Unfortunately the food is average at best service is not good.  
This is a great patio that always has a table available for a reason."}
{"text":"LIve in the area and have walked past many times. Finally decided to take my wife for dinner one Friday evening. 

Outside presentation - Building looks historic, which is nice, but walking south on Jarvis, if you miss the obscure entrance to the patio, you have to walk all the way around the patio. There is no central opening which lead pedestrians to the main door. Bad design. Secondly, the main door is this narrow unwelcoming entrance. I had to ask a smoker if this was actually the door to the restaurant. I walk up to the door and there is half a door handle. LIterally, there is a lone thumb latch which opens the door minus the actual handle. Not a great first impression.

Walk in and the greeter is nice, but I ask for a table for two and with open tables in the dining room, she asks if my wife and I want to sit at the bar. Strange. Also, it's Friday night at 7:30pm and the restaurant is at 30% capacity. Across the street at the Keg Mansion, you have to wait 45 min for a seat at the bar. Not a good sign if the restaurant is empty.

Time to order. The menu is totally different than the online version. I was expecting to order a 14oz T-bone, but no such thing exists on the actual menu.

Sit down and notice there is no fork at my wife's table setting. Not a big deal, but given the experience so far, a bit annoying. Further inspection of the dining area and I see 3 inches of stacked coasters supporting a table. Naturally the coasters are ripped, mangled and dirty.

So I ordered French Onion soup as my starter. Soup was warm. Not hot. Cheese was minimal. Bad combo for French onion.

I ordered the 10oz Rib eye that came with Mash potato and veggies. I look around my table and realize there is no salt or pepper and once I try my food I know why. The mash potato's and steak are extremely seasoned with salt. Half way through my meal I stopped tasting my food because of this. I am a salt over sugar kind of person, and this was still too much for me.

My wife ordered the Salmon and was given the option to sub mash for more veggies. She opted for more veggies, but when the dish came, the waitress acknowledged that potato's were put on the plate instead. She asks my wife if that's ok or if she would like veggies....Umm, yeah. Please bring her what she ordered. If the waitress noticed this when she brought the plate to the table, when didn't she just have the dish re-plated with the correct order?

Anyway, I was dying to stick around for dessert to see what else could go wrong, but we decided to pass. I paid my bill and tipped 15%, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My experiences always reflected the previous reviews below, poor service and average food. 

This restaurant is now OUT OF BUSINESS.  Surprised? I think not."}
{"text":"Came here for wings on a Monday night and had a good experience overall.  I loved all the different rooms (ended up sitting in the lounge-y area).  This place has a lot going on: a bar, a lounge (complete with fireplace and tvs, giving it a sort of sports bar feel) and some other nicer dining rooms as well.  The service was very good and I liked the overall atmosphere.

The wings weren't the best I've had but were pretty good.  They're on the saucy side, and were just a bit tough but the flavour was really good.  The fries were awesome, though, and the blue cheese dressing was ridiculously good (actual chunks of blue cheese....soooooo good!).  This place is a great addition to the neighbourhood and I'll definitely be back, probably for brunch."}
{"text":"A friend took us here  for brunch two weeks ago. Got the eggs florentine and apple pancake. $9 each for the entrees and $8 for liquored coffee. Food was blah. Instead of poached the eggs were hard boiled. And when they say pancake they mean it! ONE SINGLE SOLITARY LONELY PANCAKE. 

Went for dinner a couple of nights ago and ordered the meat pizza and the stinger burger.  Both were good.  The caipirinha was yummy!

Service is not speedy, but the servers are certainly nice and friendly.

Will we be coming back? Not without a coupon."}
{"text":"I went to the grand hive one at downtown toronto. I like the decoration and the sittings, the food on the other hand, can be improved."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, if you like old mansions converted to steakhouses.  However, with the Keg Mansion right across the street, its only worth going to this franchise if the line-up at the Keg is too long.  We found the menu pretty boring (wasn't the same what was advertised on their website either) but no complaints about the food we ordered (other than the medium-rare fillet had a lot more purple than I like, but that's just personal preference).  The top 40 music was on a bit loud for the intimate atmosphere and I don't know if the TVs make sense in any room other than the bar area.  Come to think of it, not sure I'd recommend this place at all.

1/2 price apps on Mondays and 1/2 price wine on Tuesdays might be worth checking out, I dunno, just throwing it out there."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like Honey's Beestro.  It's in a nice location, with a great patio, that is not far from where I live.  

The food is a big let down though, average or below average in terms of both flavour and presentation.  I ordered a sandwich that was good - a club- but the salad it came with was comprised of about 50% rotten mesclun; the lettuce on the sandwich was also black and wilting.  Accompanied by some bland and soft fries, we also sampled a small portion of mediocre wings.   

That the kitchen staff don't check the salad as they wash it or serve it was unimpressive.  The ambivalence of the wait staff / house manager to the same issue was equally so.

In the end, I wasn't billed for the salad, but there wasn't anything about Honey's Beestro that impressed me enough to give it another try.  The prices are reasonable, but my feeling is that you only get what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place just got worse.  David Miller is retweeting pics of employees protesting wages unpaid.  How appetizing is that."}
{"text":"Put simply: Great food, horrible service.

I got the rib and wings combo ($24), and my friend got the pork tenderloin entree ($21or so).  While both items tasted great, the food was COLD. 

For some reason our meal took over 30 minutes to arrive, even as the place was almost empty and as people who arrived after us started getting their appetizers.  When the food came I realized why it took so long: It must have been sitting in the kitchen for 15 minutes.  I don't know what the waitress was doing the whole time.  It was a shame that a delicious meal was partially ruined because of horrible service.

Our bill came to $70, which included 2 beers, and no appetizers.  We thought this was pretty steep for a mid-ranged restaurant like this.  For $25 a plate I'd expect to eat pretty well.  I'd probably spend that much elsewhere and eat a bit more upscale food."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place at least 3.5 stars, but I'll be conservative.  Went here for brunch with my parents while they were in town.  We were tired  and hungry, and stumbled in here on our way to Church street, but were pleasantly surprised.  The food was reasonably priced, and quite good.  The inside is great....kind of a more casual Keg Mansion.  But then again, I'm a sucker for converted historic homes.  

It was cheaper and better that Lola's Commissary, where we went the day before.  Although it has sort of a corporate vibe going on, I would go back.  Friendly staff, reasonably priced, high quality food."}
{"text":"I went here to wait out the opening of the Keg mansion. I was told several times that the kitchen was closed; however, each person gave a different time on when it would open. I decided on drinks instead. I then had to wait around to getting a menu. I ordered margeritas and when they came out, they were really tiny. I ended up spending over $20 just on two drinks. Not sure if I would go back again."}
{"text":"Also known as the \"Grand Hive,\" Honey's Beestro offers great food, great setting, and great waitresses. Sarah and Nico are amazingly charming and I will definitely come back due to their great service.  Patio is one of the best in the Village (Fuzion on Church also has a great patio), especially for summer dines/events. Interior dining is great for rainy or colder days, especially since it is set in a former manor home turned restaurant."}
{"text":"The Grand Hive Honey's Beestro is a cool place to be. It's ritzy and chic looking, yet can be casual at the same time. They stack a classic bar fitted with a bartender that mixes old-fashioned favourites. The food is secondary to the drinks, but that's not to say that the it's is bad. The menu reads well and I will definitely venture back for dinner sometime.

I had the fried calamari and walnut bruschetta. Both delicious and priced reasonably ($8-$10). But it was the drinks that lured me in and would have had me staying if I wasn't incredibly full from the dinner before. 

It was a casual and quiet atmosphere. No rush, no fuss, just time for your sipping and eating needs. I haven't been in such a calm place since Chukka Beach in Jamaica. I wore a t-shirt and a pair of jeans but I think i should have wore a button down at least.

Overall, a great place to grab a drink. Not a cheap place, but one drink in this classy bistro can last you 30 minutes with good conversation (maybe four drinks if you're on a boring date)."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. The servers on both occasions were young and seemed to lack experience, but they looked good in shorts, which is presumably why they got the job, because professional ability couldn't have been the reason.

Visit 1: Myself and my husband went to check out the new restaurant and its renovations and have a drink on the patio. Server actually said \"Hi, my name is X, and I'll be your server\" - gag, bad first impression! She knew very little about the drinks available. I ordered a caesar salad, which she forgot about - queue look of horror and rush off to order it when I pointed out its absence more than half an hour after ordering. Salad was average.

Visit 2: Went for dinner with husband and kids. Food took too long to arrive, and when it did it was awful. We got enough to share with the kids but they refused to eat it. Steak was thin and overcooked, like old shoe leather, husband says it is the worst steak he has ever had. Veggies were nasty. Burger was also dry and overcooked, to the point of being crispy, and fries (actually sort of waffley shaped) were a tiny portion. Mac and cheese wedges were salty and gross. Waitress could have sold us more drinks but I think was not savvy enough. An appetizer, two entrees, two chocolate milks, and 1.5 pints of beer was $50. Complete waste of money. 

In summary, you could not pay us to eat there again. Maybe we will go for a drink on the patio but even so it is not very inviting or buzzy so probably not. Such a disappointment, our 'hood really lacks decent restaurants!!!!!"}
{"text":"The ONLY thing this place has going for it is the patio. The menu is boring and the food is awful! Hopefully the next owners will be more original. This place certainly can't last the way it is."}
{"text":"This place is a great lunch spot! Their Southwest Chicken Salad is really good, and has some of the best ranch dressing I've had anywhere.

There's a little bit of outdoor seating which is nice in the summer, and the service was top notch both times I've been there. 

I've also had their wings, which are also very good. Absolutely nothing to complain about here."}
{"text":"Took some time before we ventured in to see what the buzz was all about.  We were not disappointed.  We arrived at 9 on a Friday night to a full house and were seated within 5 minutes.  The ribs and wings with the choices of sauce jumped out at all 4 of us.  Large portions of both.  If you are not famished, you could probably get away with sharing a meal.  The interior of the restaurant is unbelievably characteristic and worth the visit......especially if you enjoy a hearty meal.  We will definitely return and look forward to warmer weather and their patio.  It is definitely one of the nicest patios in the neighbourhood.  I should also mention....prices are comparatively reasonable."}
{"text":"We noticed a few of these around the city and decided to give it a shot.

The service was good. Although it was a Monday and the place was mostly empty.

I had the Ribs with the signature sauce, chili lime I believe, and it was quite good.  The ribs were dry, I think they were sitting out a while, but the meat was tender and like I said, the sauce was quite good.  My wife had the gumbo which was good, but needed more heat, especially for a place with \"Southern\" influence.

If the ribs had been a little fresher it would have earned another star.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Wicked service, amazing food and tap selection was not to shabby and the prices are very damn reasonable:) The group of us will definitely go back, hands down:)"}
{"text":"It might be a Canadian thing, getting only one ounce of alcohol when you order it on the rocks, but it's really lame.  I paid for a second ounce, to make it a bigger drink than in a thimble and ended up paying $14!  That was only $4 less than my short ribs...which were only decent."}
{"text":"I was there for brunch a few Sundays ago. Took my parents who were visiting from out of town. The old mansion is just beautiful. Wonderful place - the most AMAZING staff and great Eggs Benedict. So friendly when I called for reservations and twice as much when we got there.

UPDATE: Went for brunch again. Great service, great atmosphere and great food. I had eggs bacon and toast and it was wonderful - all cooked perfectly. My only complaint was that my toast was very dry and cold (and the butter on the table was quite hard and so couldn't be spread to soften it)  - but I saved it for last so that may have been my fault. There is some lovely traditional holiday decorating in evergreens and red velvet ribbons. The tree outside in front is a nice touch too.

NOTE - entrance is from the \"side\" door, not the one on Jarvis. Very inexpensive brunch menu. I'm going back to sample the ribs and wings I keep hearing about!"}
