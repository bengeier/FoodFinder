{"text":"I've been going to Angela's for approximately 20 years now.  Great food, great value, free parking, great service.  Made to order food at fast food prices.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Within a mile and a half stretch of road on the Cleveland's east side are about 4 family restaurants. Sheas and landmark included. You can never ever go wrong with any of them but when it comes to bang for your buck Angela's blows them out of the water. Great speedy food with friendly staff that make you feel not only at home but as if you're actually a part of the family. I always recommend the deluxe 12 to people as its an amazing deal that's so inexpensive you aren't even mad if you can't finish it."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. We have been here before but something has changed. The food was very nasty, I didn't receive my drink of toast until I was done eating, and it was burnt. We sent menu items back but they were still nasty. We had omelette, grits, French toast, and pancakes. The French toast was decent but don't waste your time or money!!!!"}
{"text":"Hell Naw.  Never again.  Y'all need to get up off of Uber Eats.  Stop playing.  Food was disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some all day breakfast. When I first walked in I was a little skeptical because of the typical old fashioned diner decor but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the super 8 with chocolate chip pancakes, a coffee and a chocolate milkshake. Pancakes were perfect and the coffee was very good. Great value - only $5.50 for 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon slices and 2 sausages. The staff and even the other patrons were very friendly. I would definitely go back again but this time would order only a huge stack of pancakes."}
{"text":"The food was great the coffee could've been a little stronger great location very nice waitress very timely service"}
{"text":"I love, Love, LOVE this place!!  The waitresses are home town friendly.  The grits are perfect!  I had biscuits and gravy and will be full until dinner.  Don't miss Angela's!!"}
{"text":"I have to say for a tiny place you might miss if you blink... The breakfast was amazing perfect bacon eggs and the grits yummy!! If you're ever in this neighborhood stop by."}
