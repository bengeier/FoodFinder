{"text":"This restaurant is run by a husband and wife team and the food and atmosphere are satisfactory. The husband has a more pleasant personality but the wife on the other hand is a rude woman so we hardly ever go there anymore. Once you've had a negative experience with her she has this scorn on her face when she sees you at the restaurant again. Also they tend to give very little meat and more onions, peppers and gravy in their chicken dishes. Not sure about other meat dishes."}
{"text":"Tum Nak has so many good reviews and they deserve every one!  Far east Mesa can't be the best location for a place like this, but they seem to keep customers coming back (I definitely do anyway!).  The Yellow Curry (hot) is my favorite, but I've tried just about everything on their menu and I've never been disappointed.  The only negative is that the place is super small, so as the popularity gains, the more I find myself ordering to go :)"}
{"text":"The first sit down restaurant my girlfriend and I have eaten at since moving from CA, and it set the bar high! The food was delicious, the service excellent and the restaurant was clean and inviting; we especially loved the creative menu. I had the pad si ew and it was freshly made and delicious, with lots of left overs. We go to lunch here at least once a week now."}
{"text":"Fantastic Thai restaurant !!! I ordered pad kee mew with medium spicy last night , it is so yummy!! I come back today , and I order the Pad Thai with tofu with medium spicy, everything is perfect . BTW, lunch special come with an egg roll, and very cheap. The staffs  are very friendly. I will be back soon !!!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant.   The menu cover is cool its engraved wood.  I got the chicken satay to start with.  My daughter liked that.  I wanted to try the Pad Thai (chicken) and yellow curry (spicy) also chicken.  I  love the Thai ice tea... I didn't like the pad Thai because the noodles were mushy and it tasted like vinegar.  Yuck... The chicken curry was good I asked for spicy but it wasn't.. The service was good.."}
{"text":"This small restaurant is friendly and fast.  My wife and I enjoy sharing the Chicken Pad Thai.  Next time we'll order it a bit hotter and perhaps we'll try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Pra Ram is outstanding, best peanut sauce around."}
{"text":"Such a yummy place to go for Thai food! We LOVE the massaman curry, the pineapple fried rice, and the pad see ew. Very well priced too! Small restaurant but you can order take out as well."}
{"text":"Friends introduced us to the Thai food and I am sold.  Cannot say anything negative about this place.  It was a real pleasure to eat here.  Had the number nine both times we were there.  Crowded once, got right in the second time.  Service was good, prices were fair and I am looking forward to the next time.  I really liked this place and love Thai food.  Can't say anything more."}
{"text":"Great Thai, love the pad see ewe and the pad Thai. Thai toast is also delicious. It's a little out of the way but it's quite good"}
{"text":"We eat a ton of Thai and this place is consistently good for American style Thai food. I'm a Thai trained cook and know good Thai! This is decent with a super friendly owner. The way any Thai restaurant should be."}
{"text":"This is our go to Thai food place in the east valley. The restaurant itself is unassuming but clean. We normally take out anyways. Service is always fast and haven't been disappointed by a meal from here yet! Pineapple fried rice is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Yellow curry was great and pad thai  medium is a good heat level we were very impressed. Small family place with amazing food!"}
{"text":"I would go back here. This was my first Thai restaurant that I have ever been too. I was honestly worried that I wouldn't like my food, so I kind of copped out and got Sweet and Sour Chicken (see pic!) lol. It was pretty good. I didn't care too much for how the chicken was basically these small strips, but nonetheless it was decent. I got their Fresh Thai Rolls as an appetizer and we also got fried won tons(?). I did really like the Thai Tea as well. For dessert, we had the coconut ice cream and fried bananas. The fried bananas were good and reminded me somewhat of banana nut cake. The coconut ice cream was good too, but I feel like you could probably just buy that from Fry's. Also, they give you plenty of food. I had over half of my food for leftovers, even with letting my family taste test. They bring out a big bowl of rice for everyone to share. The staff was attentive and the young lady helping us was nice. I got there before the rest of my family and picked a booth for us. There was only one other couple in there at 6:00 on a Friday. By the time we were done eating this tiny little place was totally packed. (That's a good sign!). We were going to go to another place on Power and Southern but after reading reviews on Yelp about rude service and bugs, I was able to convince my family to try this place instead. I am glad we did!"}
{"text":"I love almost everything I get here. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the pad thai but I love the curries, especially masaman.  The spice level will vary from dish to dish. Medium on one item might feel like hot on another. The owner is a great guy. I've walked in right before closing and he is still just as friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food every time! The servise is also great. The Pad Tai is to die for as well as the Hot and sour soup. I will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fresh spring rolls are so delish (haven't tried the fried, and probably won't because the fresh are sooo good)!  Every meal I've ever had here has been great.  Service is always great too!"}
{"text":"I've been a long time reader , but not a reviewer .. Here we go. This place is small , comfortable and has that Asian home feel. The food is excellent ! What's this place get 5stars is its consistency .. The food tastes the same every time . I've been here with my family over a dozen times and have ordered numerous plates.   Every plate is good. Prices are low, so dining with the family doesn't hurt the wallet.   If you feel like having Thai food , give this place and try and I'm sure you'll be coming back"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat nearby!! We used to go there 3 to 4 times a week!! We were a little unsure the first time we went, but we were blown away! The waitress always remberes us and what we get. Love it!"}
{"text":"I had the worst Pad Thai ever. The noodles were mush, too much sauce, nothing appeared to be fresh at all. One of the worst looking dishes of Pad Thai I've ever seen. The sauce tasted like pure Sriracha. I thought I was eating spaghetti. It was gross and I don't say that lightly. I have no idea how anyone would like this. Ew!"}
{"text":"favorite thai food restaurant in the valley! I recommend the pad thai and green curry. the only issue is NO COKE PRODUCTS!!! they only serve pepsi :("}
{"text":"Delicious authentic food! The people that work there are always very accommodating and nice. I would recommend this place to anyone if you want some good Thai food!"}
{"text":"Really good and cheap compared to other Thai places. Got the yellow curry with tofu, tried my girlfriends Pad Thai and it wasn't that good but I'll still go back at these prices."}
{"text":"Our go to place for thai food, The owners are great and food is excellent. Must try this one !"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancee had a craving for some Thai food. We gave this place a shot, the food was good and the portions were just rite. We came in close to closing time and we got closing time service"}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants here in Arizona and San Diego and this place has the best Pad Thai! On top of that it's almost never busy. Great place check it out."}
{"text":"While on my recent visit to Arizona, I had dinner at this cute little Thai restaurant. My family who lives in the area tell me this is their go-to place when they are in the mood for Thai food, and after eating here I could see why. The restaurant is family owned, and they are warm and pleasant. They give you a good amount of food and it's all so delicious! I ordered myself some yellow curry with seafood, tom yum with shrimp, and pineapple fried rice. All this food was more than enough to fill my hunger. Thumbs up to Tum Nak Thai!"}
{"text":"Food was super bland. No idea why people rate it so high. We actually didn't even finish it and went elsewhere for dinner."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around!  We frequent this place and have never been disappointed.  It's a small restaurant with very friendly staff.  Food is always prepared well and served quickly.  Delicious every time."}
{"text":"Never disappointed.  The Pad Thai is my favorite. Spicy when I want it, mild when I don't.  Love having the choice. The tea is quite refreshing, especially on these hot AZ days. Highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"I have always complained about the lack of interesting dinning options in east mesa. Some how I have missed Tum Nak Thai food the past few years and it is a shame. The place is pretty small and informal but the food was very good and prices were very reasonable. I had the yellow curry (Hot) and my wife had the fried rice lunch special. Both dishes were very good but the far and away star of the show was the chicken satay app that we shared. It came with a great peanut sauce that really made the chicken delicious. I recommend this place for anyone that wants a change of pace from the typical boring east mesa fare."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at Tum Nak Thai. The service was very friendly and very fast! We enjoyed the wonton soup, pineapple fried rice, an amazing dish with peanut sauce and finished with homemade coconut ice cream. We also tried the thai tea and loved it. All of the food was terrific and I'd highly recommend this authentic, family-run place to anyone.  Seating is limited, so make sure to get there early, before the crowds."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and the food has always been very good, but tonight we left before our food arrived.  We couldn't believe that a family owned business would have treated us the way we're were treated by our waitress.  No Christmas spirit existed for us tonight in this place.  Our waitress was one of the rudest waitresses my family has experienced in a long time.  My daughter's were in amazement.  Our menues were practically thrown on our table.  We asked about some menu options and she acted perturbed that we were even asking and never answered us. She didn't say hi to us once, just wanted to know what we wanted to drink and eat. I was the first to order and her response was did we want anything else?? There were four of us.  I guess she thought we were all going to share a meal. This lady never once cracked a smile.  She threw our plates on the table, stacked.  They were dirty and we set them on the empty table next to us and she brought them back to us, and when we pointed out that a couple were dirty, she gave us a dirty look and snatched them up and walked off.  We were done and decided to walk out.  We will never go back to this place.  Zero stars for customer service."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, incredible food and the owners are very friendly! Anything and everything on the menu is delicious, you can't go wrong. Support small business and try them out!"}
{"text":"A quaint seemingly family run restaurant (I think, at least).  The food here is solid, and they aren't kidding about the spice level.  The vegetables were fresh enough (i.e., no floppy brocoli stems), and the meat was good (I tried the squid).  I'm also a fan of Tom Yum, and theirs is one of the better versions I've had.  Prices are decent.  The quantity of rice is a bit stingy, however.  What's up with that?"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in town! Comfortable and intimate. Friendly staff and good price."}
{"text":"Great food for the money, mom and pop shop that Gilbert lacks!  This place puts big chains away!"}
{"text":"I love their Pad-Thai, Thai ice-tea and eggrolls! Probably my favorite place for all three. I moved away from EAst Mesa but I still try and get there once in a while."}
{"text":"We always try to find something a little off the beaten path and hopefully a small family run non chain entity.  Well this certainly fits the bill,  the place is small tucked away in a non descript strip mall but big on flavor.   The decor is comfortable and the staf are friendly and welcoming.   The menu is full of flavorful features that are fresh, crisp and customized to your particular taste.  Tonight we tried the chicken satay, very flavorful marinated and grilled chicken skewers served with a fresh peanut sauce and small refeshing picled cucumber.   The Thai fried rice was spicy enough and full of veggies and protein of choice (beef tonight). Our last dish was the cashew and vegetables served with a side of steamed rice again perfectly cooked and delicious.     There was more than enough to fill us up and still require a takeout container for what was left.  We couldn't find room for desert , so a return visit is definitely in order."}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever! I eat here when ever I want Thai."}
{"text":"I always pass by this place when I do my Starbucks runs right next door but I have never felt the need to go inside. From the outside it barely looks like a restaurant and appears tiny and dark. I'm really picky about Thai food and this place was a pleasant surprise. I usually only eat Thai food in LA but I'm glad I found one that I like in my own city now!   I got the Tom Kha soup, hot basil chicken and the Pad Kee Mao noodles. I made everything \"Thai hot\" (i love spicy food) and my mouth is still on fire! Tom Kha soup was sour, spicy and creamy...perfect! The owner was so friendly and it was a very cute and clean restaurant on the inside. I got everything to go and it was delicious so I can't wait to come back and dine in. Also, the Thai tea was soooooo good!"}
{"text":"BEST thai food I have ever had! Love the family run restaurant!"}
{"text":"New to town and recently tried this place for the first time. The line was out the door, and the whole restaurant full (plus it was storming outside, so that's sayin something!) so we knew it must be good. And it certainly was! We ordered the phad thai, phad see iw and yellow curry. All were delicious, and had just the right amount of spice. The thai iced tea was also very flavorful. Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and while I can't speak to the authenticity, the food has always been very good.  I always get an order of the pad thai, one of the curries, and either a fried rice or stir fry dish.  I have only ordered take out, but the food is always quickly prepared with large portions at an inexpensive price.  I'm always greeted with friendly service, and I would be perfectly happy paying more.  Medium to hot is plenty on their spiciness range.  I haven't dared to try thai hot, and I don't plan on it anytime soon.  Overall, very good food at a great value with pleasant service."}
{"text":"Best Thai spot I've been to in the valley.  Great selection of food and its always fresh and of highest quality.  Thai tea is the best I have had.  A+++"}
{"text":"The best Thai food on this side of town. I usually get the Massaman Curry or the pineapple fried rice and both are as good as you can get anywhere. It is a small mom and pop kind of place for dining in but great service and really good food."}
{"text":"This play is decent for thai, the menu could be a little bit more in depth, but the yellow curry was lacking flavor, but the Massaman Curry was awesome!"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai joint, very nice owners quiet atmosphere but most importantly great food!"}
{"text":"Bad service... Beef was super chewy. Thai fried rice was too salty..i told to myself Never will ever be going back.. But we were in the neighborhood, so why not give it another try..just DON'T ORDER BEEF (the chewy beef) So,  Me and my daughters walked in first then, there was a group of 3 ladies who went in after us. We waited to be greeted and seated BUT, that wasn't what we experienced, the  lady (i supposed she's the owner) ignored us and went ahead, entertained the other group had them seated instead.. Clearly, they were her friends!! They were  Laughing, chit chatting for around 3 mins. then she offered them the menu, and started asking what drinks they preferred. . So, we decided, to sit down and eaited for that server/owner to go to our table.. waiting..waiting... And nothing happened! Instead, she brought in drinks to her friends' table!!! WHat the heck is going on here!! I was so upset, disappointed, and walked out together with my 2 daughters (7 and 9 years old) So, finally..my last promise to myself....NEVER AGAIN!!! Chewy beef, salty fried rice, ignoring the customers, is not what i am expecting of a supposedly good (?) Restaurant??? No... There are other Thai restos around.. Business Not only caters to friends.. It's for everybody.."}
{"text":"Small but a nice use of space. Food is well prepared, good proportions and the little shop is well decorated. I have been to a few Thai restraints lately and had a hard time tasting the spiciness but, at Tum Nak Thai, they do not short you. I like hot food and I recommend medium, you can taste your food and still get some gradual heat as you eat.  Favorite dish is the Pad Thai, my soon to be wife likes the hot and sour soup. If I had to say something negative...I have had better tom ka soup.    It is tuck away between Starbucks and Weight Watchers, if you know the area, they took over Samurai Sam location.  Maybe 8 tables in a location that used to be a fast food restaurant"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite massaman curry. I try it at every Thai restaurant I go to, and theirs is still the best! The service can be kind of slow some nights, as it's just run by one family and they get packed, but we just plan to spend a little longer when we go. The food is so worth it! Everything my husband and I have tried has been delicious! I'm sad we ended up moving to the other side of town, so we don't go as often as we used to."}
{"text":"No matter where I go, this is my FAVORITE Thai restaurant. I love the decor. I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food restaurant. Small and perhaps not as clean as I would like, but wonderful food with great service. I would recommend it to anyone. The owners care and they are very committed to running an excellent restaurant. We will continue to eat there often."}
{"text":"Best Thai food, we've been coming here for 10 years and wouldn't go anywhere else!! Pineapple rice, egg rolls, pad Thai, curry,  anything you get you'll be sure to love...the family that owns this restaurant is sweet and they put love in all they do. Highly recommend this place for authentic food and friendly service."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here tonight and it was a pleasant experience! Our waiter was polite. The place itself is small and personable which I like. The front door is hidden though outside by a concrete pillar right next to Starbucks, ha ha.  I had the Tom Kha soup, and it was a little too spirit me by still good. Next time I'll get it more spicy instead of mild, there wasn't enough of a kick for me. Also the Thai tea was delicious, try it!"}
{"text":"Excellent Excellent Excellent...  My wife and I try to eat here at least 3 -4 times a month.  Owners are very nice to chat with.  We planned a trip to Thailand this fall, and the owners help tell us where to go and what to see."}
{"text":"Glad I finally tried this Thai restaurant. I' m going back for more. The lunch specials are economically priced."}
{"text":"My aunt and I came here about a week ago. She previously came to the restaurant and said it was good so she took me to try it. It was good. The menus are so cool."}
{"text":"Wonderul family owned business.  The takeout is fast and the eat in business is lovely.  I love the Pad See Ew! Have brought friends here and it is now our new favorite lunch stop."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. We like Thai food and this was a great find - close to home. But it's the food that sets this apart - we'd drive a long distance to get to this place."}
{"text":"They won me over with their policy of no MSG ever cause their chef is allergic to it like me!  So hallelujah I can safely eat soup!!!!   Wonton soup was fabulous !!!  Perfection!!!   Anyone with MSG allergy knows it is rarely safe to eat soup out, but it is maybe my favorite class of food.   I shall return to this gem of a place to try all their soups.  My Ginger chicken was yummy also.  The service was great!  Place was busy and very well decorated.  Love this place!!  Thank you from the bottom of my heart for being MSG free!!!   So I just went back for more soup as I seriously dreamt about it.  Thai egg rolls today with the soup--- how do they get the insides creamy when the outside is so crunchy?  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Really good Thai food. the pad Thai was excellent,  we'll be back! Staff was kind and very accommodating."}
{"text":"I love this place by Starbucks on the southwest corner of Power and Baseline!  They are consistently good.    My favorite is the chicken yellow curry (mild spice) and my husband loves loves loves the pad thai chicken (medium spice).  Their egg rolls are addictive.  And the owners are the nicest people, and their prices are very reasonable.  Great for sit it (they have a small restaurant), but we usually order take out.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. Friendly service staff. Calm atmosphere. Fair prices. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall Thai place!  Some of the best yellow curry I've had, and the Thai fried rice was also excellent.  Same with the sticky rice and Thai iced tea.  (Wasn't a big fan of the pad thai or the thai iced coffee, though.)  Recommended!"}
{"text":"This small family owned place really makes good food. My favorite dish so far is Pad Snow Peas. The Tom Ka soup is really good, I like it spicy. The service has been great every time we are there."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful little restaurant with a nice ambience and such nice menus. When I went for lunch I was almost the only customer. I experienced great customer service and fantastic food. The green curry was wonderful even when I asked for no spice. I can't wait to go back and I highly recommend this place to anyone.  I know people have mentioned before how cruel it is that this restaurant is located next door to a Weight Watchers headquarters!"}
{"text":"Best Thai Food in the entire valley hands down. Stop reading and try it. I have tried many in the valley from Scottsdale to Mesa to Chandler. This is def top 1 or 2."}
{"text":"5 out of 5 base on 1 dish. Their tom kah chicken is by far the best in the valley. This is my favorite soup and I have had so many; I just come back to this location no matter how far I am. Great balance of lemongrass which so many Thai restaurant lacks, the house mom is Thai- I know this because she and I speak Thai to each other every time I visit. Great little joint, my fiancé loves their bbq chicken and pad se eww. They bbq pork sticks with sticky rice once when I came in for lunch... To die for! They should add it to their menu :)"}
{"text":"We've been here twice and it really is fantastic. First, the restaurant is clean with a great \"Thai\" atmosphere - it looks like a hole in the wall of a strip mall but once inside it's very pretty and well-decorated.   And the FOOD - the Pad Thai is simply DIVINE! I usually skip pad thai (boring) but I could eat the entire family-sized plate. It's unreal.  We've had the green curry, pineapple curry and massaman - all were amazing and perfectly spicy. Everything is fresh, hot and authentic. Every dish is \"sharable\" and comes with plenty of rice. Even our two year old stuffed his face. Their iced thai tea is also amazing!!  Our new go-to place."}
{"text":"Loved the pad kee Mao and lettuce wraps.  Curry are all tasty too.  Not a fan if the hot soup, but service is fast and there is value in this hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place blew me away. The golden tofu appetizer is amazing, and the yellow curry was everything I wanted and more. I can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Another Yelper  recommended this place . After a year being bookmarked, we finally gave it a try. We will definitely return. I thought the flavors were delicious and the restaurant Mom and Pop cute. I was disappointed no eggplant on the menu though."}
{"text":"Great Thai for Mesa, AZ. We always order takeout and you get a large portion for a reasonable price- especially in comparison to other Asian takeout places.   Always get the yellow curry and the garlic veggies with meat and they are both great. Not the BEST Thai I've ever had but definitely good for being 5 minutes from our house."}
{"text":"I'm not sure exactly how we found Tum Nak Thai.  It's tucked away between a Starbucks and a Weight Watchers, in a funky shopping center in Mesa.. who knew?  Great family run Thai restaurant.  Very large menu.  I have a tendency to order the same couple of things every time I go, despite promising myself to venture into the rest of the menu.  The chicken massaman is phenomenal.  If I'm feeling dangerous, I'll hit the chicken panang (equally as good).    You can dine in or out.  We tend to order out because it's right around the corner from our house.  Everything is ready in 10 minutes.  If I call in from Val Vista and 60E, the food is piping hot and boxed by the time I pull in the parking lot."}
{"text":"One of my staple go-to places for lunch. The food is always great, with high quality, fresh ingredients. The owner is super nice and always remembers what I order. I have tried several different dishes but always find myself going back to the spicy green beans with beef.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking for something new."}
{"text":"I can't believe the good reviews on this place. We tried it last night, got a large variety of items, tried the chicken satay, fish cake, and papaya salad, pad Thai, spicy basil, fried rice, pad ki mow, pepper beef, and garlic chicken. The noodle dishes were over-cooked and mushy, rice dishes lacked flavor, the papaya salad was inedible, as were the fish cakes! We threw away most of our order, everything tasted more like Chinese food, and not a fresh Thai food taste! So disappointed. $110, wasted! If you really like \"Thai food\" this is not for you!"}
{"text":"So I chose this place because they were open at the time I wanted to go pick up dinner at 4pm.  Ordered a Papaya salad and Pad Thai. They asked how I wanted it Mild Medium or Hot.  I stayed safe and said mild for both.  Well, when I got home and opened up the containers--of which they stupidly put them in one bag-dumb because papaya salad is always cold- I had to remove it in the car before heading home.  The Papaya salad was not evenly cut...their shredder is not working and it is supposed to be picked up like speghetti...this was clumps of papaya shredded half way. ALL I COULD TASTE WAS ONION. ONION...like eating a clumpy mouthful of ONION.  Horrid.  The Pad Thai had dry pieces of chicken and ZERO seasoning.  AWFUL. CRAP.  Waste of $17. NEVER BE BACK. They cannot produce Thai food that is worthy.  Instead of driving back to the place to return this...I'm writing this review. STAY AWAY.  Should have gone to Thai Plates or tried another place..these guys were the only ones open at the time I wanted food.  BAD DECISION. STAY AWAY. Headed to the fridge to eat crackers and cheese. TICKED."}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp, looking for something new to try before a movie and OMG, what a hidden gem. Best Thai food I've ever had, great atmosphere (little family-run hole in the wall joint), excellent service, and the prices are unbelievably low. I just can't say enough positive things about this place, I was amazed, and I will keep coming back. If you're looking to try something new, DO NOT miss this."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with some friends. I had never been here before. Ordered a shrimp dish that the server recommended. I thought it was subpar. The service was not good and the food definitely didn't make up for it.  Maybe it was just the dish I tried but I didn't like it."}
{"text":"My daughter wanted her standard \"Chinese\" for weekend lunch so I decided to broaden her horizons. We were in the area and I had been to Tom Nuk Thai once a long time ago and remembered it being good so we stopped in.   Besides one older couple, we were the only ones there. It was 2:38 in the afternoon on Saturday. The waitress came quickly and asked about drinks. I ordered a Thai iced tea, my daughter had a sprite. The waitress disappeared and came back with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order. I asked if we could still get the lunch specials (available until 2:30). No, she said. We were 8 minutes late. ??really?? Ok, so we ordered chicken satay, pad see ew, and larb salad. I asked for medium heat, my daughter isn't a pro with spicy food yet.   The Larb and pad see we were excellent. The Larb was tangy with hints of mint and cilantro. Both dishes though had a little kick. There was plenty of chili pepper flakes in both dishes. My daughter was hungry though and are her full. The satay came last. It was also good. My daughter liked the peanut sauce because by this time her mouth was on fire and was drinking my iced tea.   The food was great. The only odd thing was how rushed our waitress was. Seriously 100 miles an hour like she was busy doing something else. I'd go again, but would make sure to beat the 2:30 deadline."}
{"text":"Good food and they even made it \"Thai hot\" which was nice. The only reason I give them 4 stars is they don't serve beer! Friendly owners in a very small place."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Love this place and eat here twice a week religiously. Red curry and panang are sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Decided to walk on the wild side & try something new.... Glass Soup! Hot hot hot What a pleasant surprise. The texture of the noodles was like nothing I've ever had before and I am a sucker for anything with baby corns in it! My entree was the; Pad Kee Mao Spicy stir-fried noodles with hot basil flavor of basil, bell peppers, bamboo shoots, carrots, white onions, egg and your choice of meat IT WAS D'LISH... I like my dishes on the spicy side and this did not disappoint. Unfortunately I just don't remember the spicy level I choose but it had to be a 5-7. ;-)"}
{"text":"One word: DELICIOUS  I'm literally here about once a week. Love getting the Pad See Iw and also the fried rice. Their Thai Toast as an appetizer is very good. Let's not forget their sticky rice and custard or sticky rice with mango. Very nice owners, cute little restaurant. Really do recommend to check it out."}
{"text":"Very good food but they ran out of dessert so we had to share.  Not good, cuz my wife loves the coconut ice cream and I didn't get my fair share.  Better luck next time!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's a hidden treasure and the food is SO good, and reasonable. I compare all other thai restaurants to this one; so far, none compare. I crave the Pad Thai (medium)! The Pad See Ew, Pineapple Fried Rice with Chicken (YUM) ~ all so good. Very friendly family-run business.  The only down side is although I want them to be successful, I want them all to myself  ;)"}
{"text":"Best local Thi food, and very good service. Lunch spl. Are very reasonably and quite good. If coming for dinner get here early!!!"}
{"text":"Whether you're new to thai food or are a die hard fan, you won't be disappointed here. I personally lean more towards the die hard side, especially when it comes to curry, and every curry dish they put out is perfect, every single time. Massaman is probably my favorite, or yellow curry. Their noodle dishes are also amazing as are their soups  and appetizers. Basically they take their time to make sure everything is cooked to perfection, and serve it up hot and fast with great service. With limited options for non-chain great dining on this side of town, I seriously hope Tum Nak never leaves!!"}
{"text":"For lunch or dinner the portions and quality are hard to beat.  When it is busy they can be a little slow but they are attentive once they get to you"}
{"text":"The best Thai i've found in Mesa/Gilbert yet."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it's always the same...Awesome!!! The yellow curry is delicious with the spiciness made to your comfort level. It is not a large place but it has some cool decorations and a warm family business type feel to it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes supporting local business and enjoys great food."}
{"text":"Out of the local places this is the best, I've never eaten there so I always order over the phone. Get the pad Thai or pad sew ew!"}
{"text":"Place has amazing decor and the food is wonderful as well. Highly recommend.  Owner was very attentive and everything just looks nice."}
{"text":"We came here for the lunch special which was extremely reasonable. The waiter was fast with his service which is always a plus!! My family ordered a pad sae ew, pad thai and a yellow curry. All their dishes were seasoned well with just the right amount of spiciness! (They will ask you how spicy you want it). However, the pad thai was a little on the sweet side, but other than that there food and service was above par.   We came on a Monday during lunch time and the place got packed quick. The restaurant is small, so come early if you want to beat the rush of people!!"}
{"text":"No complaints. Portions were crazy big!  Def go back again if I'm ever in the Mesa area."}
{"text":"Love the Thai food here, especially the chicken pad thai. I usually order my food ahead to go, and it's always ready when I get there. Very nice owners too."}
{"text":"One of the best thai food restaurants i have ever eaten at. The pad thai is ok but the Pad See Iew is fantastic."}
{"text":"I have tried 3 thai Restaurants in Gilbert & this has been a favorite. The dishes we order have always been authentic & consistently delicious.  So far I've tried their Pad Thai, Thai Fried Rice, Hot n Sour Soup, Lemongrass Coconut Soup, Panang Curry (my all time fav),  Red Curry, Yellow Curry & Pineapple Curry. Get Thai Tea to drink too, yum! Also be sure to wrap up your meal with some Mango w/Coconut Sticky Rice.  Their prices are really good too. We just moved from Orange County, California & we have enjoyed this spot alot!"}
{"text":"I love Thai and have a favorite in town, however i saw Tum Nak and thought i would give it a try.   I had Pad Thai (which is what I always have the first time i go to a thai place) Everything was very fresh and prepared well, however the flavor was not to my liking.  I ordered medium heat (there was almost no heat) and what i couldn't figure out was how they added spice... usually it is with a chili oil, crushed red chili peppers and sometime they will use thai hot peppers... I couldn't get over the fact that it tasted like they just added Tabasco sauce.  Now to be clear, i do not want to accuse them of doing that, every thing seemed cooked way to honestly for them to just pour in some tabasco at the end for heat, so i don't think they did... but it really tasted like they had. So i just didn't like it.  Their lunch special prices were very reasonable.   I will give them another go because of the fact that everything was very fresh and cooked very well.  I think i just didn't like the flavor of the Pad thai medium heat...."}
{"text":"This place is a cute mom and pop's shop. Good is excellent. The Pad See Iw is my all time favorite and always get the chili on the side. Also, I always get the Thai Tea which is perfectly sweetened. I wished they had boba tapioca balls in it!  The yellow chicken curry is pretty good as well.   The place gets busy during lunch but they get you in as quick as possible. Good customer service and good good!"}
{"text":"This place was a happy surprise. Not a lot of seating, but the food and service is great.   Started with the fried wontons (they were delicious with ground chicken in them.) Entree I had the Lad Na (flat noodles pan fried with brown gravy with chicken, broccoli and carrots.) The gravy was very flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly. I also tried the Thai iced tea which Brian recommended, tasted good but was not really my thing.    All in all a really tasty Thai place!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!  Service excellent as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Has to be some of the best Thai I've found in Mesa. It's not on the menu, but they do have pad woon sen, you just have to ask. The yellow curry is also delish. Fair warning this is a tiny place and it's ALWAYS busy, so it's best to go in knowing that there could be a wait for seating. I always do takeout...I'm smart like that. They don't serve alcohol, now wouldn't a beer be great with some spicy Thai? Still worth the trip and the owners are super sweet and friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I placed an order over the phone that was delayed over an hour. I was told over the phone that it was going to be only 15-20 min for me to pick it up. I showed up 30 min later and my order was still delayed. I ended waiting for another half of hour to receive my order. The pick up service was the worse I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Were looking for some thai food on the way home and saw this place in Yelp. It can be tricky cold-calling a restaurant to place a to-go order, but the guy on the phone was very helpful.  I asked for his favorite thing on the menu, and was a little nervous when he said pad thai... the most generic thai dish I can think of. I like pad thai, but I've found it is rarely the best thing on a menu.  So I grilled him a bit and he stuck by his guns.  We ended up with the pad thai and some tom ka soup, and both were fantastic. We went with Medium spice as we always do the first time we try a thai place, and it was tangy but not too hot.  We'll definitely be back to explore the rest of the menu and see for ourselves if the pad thai is the best they have!"}
{"text":"Reliable Thai food. Not the best, but good and well priced. Spicy yellow curry is my go-to."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Thai food, and when I had lunch here it was very good.   Service was quick.   The hot tea was tasty but they never refilled it.   When lunch arrived it was well cooked but not quite as spicy as I had asked for.  But all in all, this was one of the better Thai place that I've found in Mesa."}
{"text":"Very fast, friendly, and accommodating service. Food was spiced perfectly, and was delicious. Only thing I would suggest is that they get a slightly bigger place...it was packed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go here whenever we are close by. The prices are great and so is the food. You can't loose with the menu. I always get the hot basil but the fried rice and curry dishes are great and so are the soups and Thai fresh rolls. I have never had a bad experience here and lunch is quick cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and the same experience, only progressively worse. First, the food is good. There are better Thai places in Gilbert, but their food is decent and the location is convenient. Second, the prices are also very fair and reasonable. Now the bad news. Horrible service. The dining room and take out service is all handled by one woman, the owner. She is simply overwhelmed trying to manage the dining room orders, answer the phone and settle up with the steady stream of carry out customers. They really should just hire some help!  This past visit we waited ten minutes to place an simple order (larb, salad, and soup). After another 40 minutes we were told rather brusquely to \"keep waiting\". After another 5 minutes we left. Sorry, their food isn't so good, or the strip center ambiance so great, that it's worth nearly an hour's wait for food.  Tum Nuk Thai...I suggest hiring at least one more person. We won't be back though."}
{"text":"One of my other favorites in the Mesa area for Thai food! I get the Pad Gra Tiem with beef. Sooo good. Owners are super nice, and the service is good. Before I moved I would get togo all the time, and they would always have it ready in a timely, efficient manner."}
{"text":"I eat at this place often and it has proven to be consistantly terrific! I often get it for take out but, stop in and eat inside sometimes too. Take out is so fast! Great portions and flavors a MUST TRY if you havent already."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai place in the valley. It is small so be prepared to wait on the weekend. Yellow curry, pepper steak and pad Thai is the best."}
{"text":"Service was good and the restaurant was clean. We ordered the Fried Wonton appetizer and it was over done, not good. I ordered the Pad See Iw and ordered it medium which was bland it was so mild. I added chili sauce to kick it up a notch.  I have been testing out other Thai places in the area and from this experience it doesn't rank near the top. It's not terrible. It's not great either."}
{"text":"Good Thai place with plenty of seating. Food comes out fast, but if you order it to go I recommend calling ahead, especially during lunch time when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Great little place! Came here initially with my mom during lunch to see what kind of lunch specials they offered. It was great. Got a nice bowl of red curry and I was really pleased with the taste and the heat level. I usually go to a place in Gilbert, but they do not have lunch specials like this place. I felt like I got a generous portion at an affordable price. The 2nd time I went it was during dinner time and the place was very busy. This time I went with a Thai Iced tea w/ cream for a drink (MUST TRY!) and a pineapple curry. The curry was very well balanced and the pineapple chunks inside were a nice little addition. Recommended to anyone who loves a good curry."}
{"text":"Second best Thai in East Valley(behind  Yupha's). Pad See Ew is tasty with well-cooked noodles, flavorful sauce and carrots and broccoli. Massaman curry was okay (not as dense as the flavors elsewhere), hubby really likes the Pad Thai-I don't care for it here as it is pretty sweet. Pass on the stir fry, as it was pretty bland and ordinary, as is the thai fried rice(lacking flavor and stickiness to rice).   Since this is some of the better Thai in the area and closer than Yupah's, we have learned to stick with Pad See Ew and Pad Thai. The service is friendly and the food prepared quickly. Our orders, even with substitutions and add-ons, have always been correct."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in the far east valley."}
{"text":"Crap. What did I do. I think my reviews (and the others posted) have gotten 10X more customers in here during weekday afternoon lunch hour. Oh well... it's STILL delicious, even after I've tried several different dishes."}
{"text":"This place never lets me down!! The food is amazing. My favorites include the chicken Pad Thai, and Spicy Thai basil fried rice!! Spice level is alway what I request, hot! Also the right amount of sweetness to the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place got 4.5 stars? Clearly people have never had good thai food. The egg roles were mediocre (can't mess those up) and the chicken skewers were dry as hell and the peanut sauce was literally peanut butter and I don't know what was wrong with this chicken pad Thai... But it was so saucy and had a tomato paste flavor and chicken was way overdone. Gross. We took 2 bites each of the pad thai and didn't even get asked how the food was.... Really? Clearly it was crap because we didn't eat it. Went here for my birthday last night instead of our usual place Nunthaporns in downtown mesa since it was closer. Essentially my birthday dinner was crap and went home hungry. I'm sorry, but if you don't care about the quality of your food then this is your place! The only reason they got 1 star is because I am required to rate them. *thumbs down*"}
{"text":"Delish! I love this place, they have the best Panang I have ever had. Th customer service here is excellent. I usually order to-go and they know my name when I call. The quality of food is consistent and very good. My husband has ordered the basil beef which is great but the Panang is my favorite. Their fried rice and soups are great too. Try a thai iced tea, yummy! We will continue coming back, glad to have great thai food within driving distance."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, good service.  Loved the pineapple rice and curry.  Tip: they serve family style, so order as a table and plan to eat some of every dish."}
{"text":"This isn't a very big restaurant - but it has heart! They have about 8 booths and a large table. They serve great tasting food at a decent price! I've dined here a few times; always enjoying the food immensely. The establishment is clean, the people are efficient and they have a great menu. The food comes out fast so you won't hungry long. The atmosphere is nice as well."}
{"text":"I'm really picky about Thai food because I grew up eating it almost every day.  We ordered take out so maybe they were just in a hurry because the girl on the phone told me it would be 5 to 10 minutes.  I got the beef salad.  Very dry and bland.  Same with the larb. My husband wasn't fond of his massamun curry either. Said his was bland too. Bummed because I'm on a hunt for a really good Thai place! Giving at least 2 stars because staff was friendly and prices were very reasonable. If I was basing it on just food, would only be 1 star:("}
{"text":"Absolutely best Thai food in Arizona!  Every dish I've had there has been full of flavor that keeps me coming back for more.  When the weekend arrives and I'm ready to eat out, 9 times out of 10 I end up at Tum Nak Thai.  You simply cannot go wrong with any dish there.  I usually prefer the seafood combo in my dish of choice, and they do honor small requests such as removing the shrimp tails for me.  And how hot you want any of the menu items is up to you, as you can order anything mild, medium or hot.  Family owned and very friendly service, and if I could afford it, I'd eat there every day."}
{"text":"We LOVE coming here for the good food and family owned feel.  The food is amazing, cheap and largely portioned.  Be aware that like many \"hole it the wall\" places, a large influx of people or big parties may not be served as quickly.  That being said, if there is a wait, it is always well worth it!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time on a Friday night. It was busy but we were able to get a table right away. After we were seated, we waited for about 20 minutes until we were helped. I think there were circumstances that made some of their wait staff unavailable for a bit but it was still unfortunate. Once we ordered, our food took a little while to come out. The food itself was pretty good. I wasn't crazy about my soup but my husband's noodle dish was good and our friend's Pad Thai was excellent. Because of the service issue, I'm not sure we would go out of our way to return here. Overall, it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"Once again disappointed with Arizona asian food. The place is small, nicely decorated, and family-run.  I ordered the pad see ew which had a different flavor profile than I'm used to with the dish. The noodles were dry and they use that thin, dry, rubbery chicken with western vegetables instead of the authentic, traditional variety. I would suggest ordering a spice level up from what you'd actually want. As my friends and I endearingly describe, \"it's white people spicy\" (no offense meant). $6 for lunch special (comes with a small veggie egg roll) is great, but the portions are small to match. Service was so-so. He was obviously overwhelmed by lunch rush and never refilled my water."}
{"text":"I've never been more disappointed. I had literally been talking about the food here for the past seven years since we last visited but it wasn't nearly as good as I remember. Maybe we chose the wrong dishes (pad thai and pad see ew) or maybe there's a different cook. Unfortunately I won't be back."}
{"text":"I visit Arizona at least once a month and this place has become a fav of mine! Everything we ordered was so delicious and the customer service was great as well. I went in on a Saturday about noon, they have a good lunch menu for less than $6 just keep in mind it ends at 2:30. Good portions and very filling. I went home with leftovers. I would highly recommend this little restaurant if you like Thai food."}
{"text":"The food was so flavorful!  Three of us went & we all agreed that this was the best Thai Food we have had here.  I had the drunken noodle, 1 guest had pad Thai & the other had Thai fried rice with Tofu.  All were exceptional!  We will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Yummmm.. Thai fresh rolls are SO fresh. Chicken satay is super flavorful. And the crab dish I had last time was amazing..i don't recall which but it had rice, veggies, egg and real crab. This place is great!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was less than expected.  I asked a question to the waitress, and I guess she didn't know English.  Then my food came out 7 minutes before my boyfriends. No one said anything, like \"oh it'll be a minute\" or \"sorry it's taking so long.\"  And then as soon as he got his food they put the check on the table and kept trying to take my food.  I said \"no\" twice, and they kept trying to take it.  Like I said, the food was good, but there seems to be communication issues service wise."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!  Their lunch menu is VERY affordable, filling and delicious!  I have tried almost everything on the lunch menu and all are recommended.  I LOVE LOVE their Yellow Curry.....Staff is friendly and fast service!!"}
{"text":"Who knew this little gem was right around the corner from my house right next to my neighborhood Sbux! Best Thai food I've had! We started with an appetizer, por Pia Sod! Healthy and delicious! We shared the Tom Kha soup and just loved the flavor the lemongrass and coconut milk gave this famous hot and sour soup! My husband and I shared two entrées, Red Curry with beef and Pad Thai with tofu, which we came no where near to finishing! Large portions and both were just superb! Medium heat was perfect for me but my husband would have preferred it with a little more heat! The only reason I give this 4 stars rather than 5 is because they do not serve wine or beer so we saved money and did take out. It was hot and ready in 15 minutes! We will most definitely be regulars of this latest find!"}
{"text":"We LOVE the Panang Curry with chicken and the Spicy Green Bean entrees.  Owned and operated by a family that's sweeter than sticky rice.  Limited space in the dining room and it is busy on weekends. Take out is the solution and they can have just about anything ready in ten minutes!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant this far.  Delicious food and great atmosphere, Food was served hot and with just the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"Love this place. Huge portions for the money and great lunch specials. We've been there a few dozen times and everything, from the service, to the food, to the wait time is consistent which I like."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very reasonably priced!  We LOVE the Pepper Steak stir fry with beef and the Massaman Curry is always a favorite of ours.  We finished the meal with Mango Sweet Rice and it was delicious as well.  It's fast, affordable and delicious food with fabulous service.  Our drinks were never empty!  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a place that has a pan nang curry like one I had when visiting Seattle, well I finally found it here! Delicious to say the least! I also had the Tom ka soup which was also very good! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Almost made it to 4 star, but decided that i have had better.  Very good yellow currie.  Stir fry was middle of the road.  You should definitely get some coconut ice cream!"}
{"text":"First time at Tum Nak Thai today. Even tho we arrived at 3 PM, it was half full inside (a good sign).  Ordered Beef Larb, Shrimp Pad Thai and Pork Spicy Green Beans.   The service was fast to start and our Larb arrived in 7 mins. It was tasty, with just the right amount of spice. Most of it was on top of the lettuce tho, so we couldn't eat it as a wrap, just with forks. Still good tho.   3 mins later our entrees arrived, piping hot. The Pad Thai had a sweet taste but very good. The Green Beans were spicier than we expected. We realized that they were called Spicy Green Beans but we ordered all our dishes medium hot and this one was blazing.   Service was a bit off after that, probably due to the crowd. Just mom serving 6 tables and she had trouble keeping up. Never got offered any drinks beyond water and even that got ignored despite an empty glass.   I recommend Tum Nak Thai but hopefully they will add a server."}
{"text":"Family orientated. Lots of parking available the curries the three flavors or four flavors that they have are all super yummy. The spices are hot they give you a choice medium is still pretty spicy hot is hot Thai spicy will kill you. Thai iced tea super yummy desserts super yummy the friendliest staff.The owners your waiter the owners the cashier would definitely come here again and again and again and have been for the past 10 years. Only gripe their English not the best so speak slowly and clearly on what you want when placing an order over the phone."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a while. It is our favorite Thai place in the east valley. The curry dishes have good flavor and the decor is very cute. We also like the chicken satay, papaya salad, seafood salad and many other dishes. The coconut ice cream with fried bananas is presented beautifully. We have always had pleasant service and it is true that they can be slow. But I don't understand all comments about the owners wife being rude, she is always nice to us. It is nice to have a Mom and Pop restaurant to go to instead of all these big chain restaurants. This place is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Best pad Thai you will find in Arizona and the price is something that can not be beat. Also the have a great mango dish that is as tasty as tasty can be. We will always double our pad Thai order and save some for another time."}
{"text":"Hate to be the sour apple amongst all these glowing reviews but when you have a customer who can't eat something you serve them and they tell you that after you ask how your lunch was (plate almost untouched, BTW) and you don't offer to do something about it...... what can you say?!?!? I ordered Pad Thai and after I tasted it, I was unable to eat it as it was so sickening sweet that I thought I was going to go into sugar shock. Now the review that I did just before this one was also about Pad Thai that was a BIT too sweet. I'm not sure if Asian/Thai restaurants in this area think that Arizonians prefer their Pad Thai sweeter than where I'm originally from (honestly... I have eaten A LOT of Pad Thai) or if it's just that my tastes have changed, or just what. The main difference is that the last place the Pad Thai was just a little too sweet and didn't taste like the cook used 1/2 bottle of clear Karo syrup in the making of the meal.  Also.... the last place had a fellow who was unable to tolerate the spiciness of his lunch and when the server there saw he wasn't eating it, immediately  inquired and substituted another entree. MY server here at Tum Nak Thai asked if everything was alright (full plate of food pushed-away from me) and when I told him I couldn't eat is he asked me if I wanted a take-home container and recommended the #4 lunch special the next time. NEXT TIME?!?!? ....... Sorry..... this type of lack of concern is inexcusable!!!!  No thanks!!!!! I ended-up going to Subway to get something to fill my stomach . :^/"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food, service,  and atmosphere of this place.   Today, however, there chef had a bit of a heavy hand with the pepper.  We will be back as the food and service are great"}
{"text":"Breast thai food in the east valley.  It is worth finding tis hidden gem.  The food is consistently amazing and flavorful.  Good for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Their spicy beef and green beans is great! And the hot level had a great kick! Not sure if I could have handled the Thai hot and still have enjoyed the food the entire meal. I've now tried the pad thai and yellow curry, both are delicious too. You can't beat their lunch special, crazy cheap but still enough food, and comes with a surprisingly, fairly authentic egg roll! 11:30-12:30 lunch times does get a little crowded but the wait wasn't more than 10m. Pick up on a week night at 8pm was 30m though."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place to come hands down!! The food is great and the staff is so friendly.  I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered.  The lunch specials are such a great deal, and they are offered on Saturday too which is a bonus!"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch at least once a week. Great food, great prices, great ambiance. The menus are unique, with a fabric cover and wooden carvings on it, which I haven't seen before. If you like Thai food, you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Really this should be a 2.5 star review.   So I have to breakdown the restaurant as follows..... The food was good. The pineapple fried rice Was fantastic.  The Thai Fresh rolls were excellent. The basil chicken was good. The Pad Thai was very different and in my opinion Below average.   The reason for the low review is the service was just bad. The food came out separately over about 20 minutes. We had a group of 7 and the rice came out for one person and then about 20 minutes later the last of the pad Thai came out. Our server took out order and then never came back.  No refills.  In addition to that the pad Thai orders were messed up. The spicy levels and different meats were all mixed up.   The decor of the restaurant left a lot to be desired. The tables were duct taped together and the atmosphere was a bit dingy.   The restrooms were clean."}
{"text":"Ordered tom yum and glass noodle soup for appetizers this cold evening -both were excellent. Pineapple fried rice and Penang curry we ordered were very good; not the best but certainly good. The curry had a kick despite having ordered mild. This is not a damper on the taste however. One MUST try the fried banana with ice cream. That was the best part of the meal. Ambiance was great as well as the service, considering I had a rambunctious toddler in tow.  A great place for Thai in the area, reliably good!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but yummy food and great service. Chicken satay and Panang is so good. Just try it, u won't regret and the price is right."}
{"text":"Food - one of the better Thai places I've tried in the area. Portion was average. Their food is a bit on the sweeter side, especially the Thai iced tea - SUPER SWEET. They have a good selection of each food category. Curry was a bit watery and their sweet and sour was either sweet nor sour..  Price - pretty good!  Service - the servers were friendly but always seems so rushed even when there are only two other tables when we were dining in. We had to flag her down a couple of times to get extra sets of utensils, napkins, order dessert, etc.  Parking - private lot, plenty of spaces right in front of the restaurant. Same plaza as Goodwill and 99 cents store.  Payment - they accepts credit cards! yippee!  *Tips* It seems like they take a lot of togo orders over the phone so if you're looking to togo something, it would be best to call ahead. We walked in to place an order and had to wait almost 40mins to get our togo order."}
{"text":"I've had Pad Thai with Chicken and Tofu here at lunch and dinner. The lunch portion is smaller but it comes with a fried egg roll. I only get mild but I hear that medium spiciness is pretty spicy.  The dinner portion to go is amazing. I tend to eat a lot, and my friend and I were able to share a dinner portion and were completely full afterward.  I love Tum Nak Thai because they don't charge extra for splitting up the meat. I love fried tofu, but sometimes I just want a little meat, so I always ask for a mix here.   The flavor is good, but the dish is pretty oily."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant. Like another reviewer said, the seasoning is on the sweet side -- too sweet for me. That was the case for the Thai ice tea, the spring roll dipping sauce, and the cashew stir fry.  On the other hand, prices were reasonable and the owner was very nice, so I'm giving my rating an extra half star. I don't think I'd return, though."}
{"text":"Very disappointed as a long term customer. The food is not as good as it used to be. The staff is very unprofessional and rude. The foods always missing ingredients and it's either too salty or bland. I wouldn't recommend any of their soups. All the curries taste disgusting."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this as my friends have been wanting to go and the reviews looked good. I'll say it's not the best but it's not the worst. There were 7 of us that went so we ordered quite a bit of the menu and shared. They were very busy so I'm wanting to go back and try again   Let's start with drinks,  I wanted hot tea, the server said they didn't have then the owner I assume whipped some up, was different than normal hot tea but it was ok.   The curries were very thin but had good flavor. Wish they were hotter though, especially since we requested hot.  The soups were nice and spicy as requested. The pad Thai was very different and not a huge fan.   The apps were really good!!   I will give this place another shot"}
{"text":"A Thai friend told me to check this place out if I wanted authentic food.  We went for dinner one Saturday night.  Nice decor and clean!  My cutie pie loves egg rolls, so we ordered that as as a starter.  It came out crispy hot with a cooling sweet and sour sauce.  Just cabbage?  Four dollars for four, you kinda expect a little bit of ground pork in there.    For our entrees, out came Chicken Pad Thai ($8), Seafood Red Curry ($10)and Beef Panang Curry ($9).  \"The noodles are too saucy!\"  My son complained as he ate the pad thai and resorted to picking on the  reheated rice instead...I'm Filipino, I know what fresh steamed rice should  taste like.  Cutie pie didn't  care much for the meal.  Noodles were cooked just right, but the sauce had the Kikkoman or low grade soy sauce that I'm not too fond of.    The curries are so dang salty!  I can feel my blood pressure rise and my feet swell up.  The beef is low grade chuck or round, it was really tough to chew.  Underneath the salt and beef, there is the curry with keffir lime, thai basil and creamy coconut milk that I love.   The seafood curry was just okay as well.  We really wanted to like this place.  The service was fast and friendly.  If we go back, I would like to try other dishes and would definitely update with our next experience."}
{"text":"You're perfect cheap, neighborhood Thai restaurant.  Service is always great.  Portions are big.    Have not had a dish that disappointed"}
{"text":"Good prices and the best Thai within this area. Staff is always nice, we've had a good experience dining in and for take out. Their pad Thai and curry is easy and can't go wrong, the egg rolls are just alright."}
{"text":"Cheap lunch specials. Thai fried rice was good."}
{"text":"Mesa AZ's little secret! The best Thai food around. The owners are delightful people. Recommended for all ages. Nice selection of dishes and coconut ice cream is the best!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times to eat inside their family restaurant.  They run a great business. Their food is great I love the yellow coconut curry at a level 10! I get their food to go all of the time. They are quick and easy to communicate with."}
{"text":"My go-to restaurant for very tasty, genuine Thai food. Great lunch specials.  Favorites from the dinner menu: fish cake, tom kha soup, pad thai, hot basil, Thai iced tea"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the Hot and Sour Soup!!!! Seriously, I eat large bucket of that stuff in one evening- lots of delicious tofu chunks and bamboo shoots, perfectly spicy at \"Medium,\" and the mushrooms are juicy and flavorful (I'm getting hungry just writing this). Tofu Pad Thai is peanutty, spicy and delightful, as well.  Like my main man, \"Tom R.\" states- the place is \"well-decorated.\" Intricate carvings everywhere and, of course, loads of elephants all over the walls. We almost always order our food for carryout, and it stays extremely warm all the way home- no reheating necessary.  Regarding the spice level, \"Medium\" is what I always order and exactly what I expect- hot enough to make you reach for a cold drink for a sip now and then, opens up the sinuses by the end of the meal... NOT so hot you've downed a 6-pack by the end of the Pad Thai.   If you don't like spicy food (i.e. you like \"mild\" salsa), just tell them, and I'm sure they'll accommodate your tastes."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Thai food but this place is my absolute favorite! The pad see iw is by far my favorite dish and having it served with their Thai tea makes for a perfect meal. It does take a while to get the food, especially during lunch, but the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Delicious Pad Thai. Family owned and super nice staff. Really great Thai tea. Also if your in a hurry the carry out is always on time and is just as fantastic."}
{"text":"Great prices for their lunch menu! $5.95 For all their specialties and a spring roll. Ran by friendly people and were pretty quick. Not much room for large groups, only a couple tables to put together. Love their wooden menus!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The owners don't speak or understand english but their kids do.  They are a great little family doing their thing.  Great food prepared fast with large orders. I eat here often, and would eat here everyday if I could.  Alot of the larger restaurants could learn alot from this little gem.    great food.  The fried rice here is the goods.   WiFi is free as there is a startbucks next door."}
{"text":"Small cozy place, decent lunch specials!  This place is ranked #2 in best thai places in the east valley (unofficial poll). They offer great service and are quick - when ur in a rush. I wouldn't say the food is authentic but  it's delicious. I like it because it's a family business and the family is really sweet."}
{"text":"Yummy! The mild Pad Thai was divine! Egg rolls were great also....will be back! Service was a little slow, super busy."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites!! The food is exceptional, especially the pineapple curry. Everything I have tried, which is almost everything, I have absolutely LOVED.  The Pad Thai is amazing, the lime shrimp soup that I don't remember the name of is amazing, the green curry is tasty. It's a battle every night whether we should go here or try something new. I have thrown this up ( not due to the food, I had the stomach flu) and I still love to eat here! Usually puking something up ruins it for me...not in this case. I can't beat the love for Tum Nak Thai. The servers are helpful, they get you what you want, make sure you're taken care of, but they don't hover, which is a pet peeve of mine. If you're thinking about trying it...do it!"}
{"text":"A place has to be perfect for 5 stars but this place is deserving !!! The drunken noodles aka pad kee mau (sp?) were AMAZING. Also their Peanut Sauce on the Pra Ram rivaled with my all time fav joint in San Diego (bahn Thai) Yes east valley....FINALLY worthy Thai dishes. Fresh, authentic and mouthwatering"}
{"text":"I don't understand why the ratings are so high for this place. I'm spoiled coming from OR where Thai restaurants are plentiful and delicious. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, fried wontons, and a side of peanut sauce. First off, their delivery boxes leaked all over the bag which was annoying. Second, the pad Thai was orange. I've never seen this before. The wontons were dry and the sweet sauce with it, leaked out of the container also. The only thing redeeming to me is their peanut sauce. I felt like I was eating cafeteria food. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Always a solid lunch choice.  It is a very small space and gets full quick on my experience during lunch.  Prices are fair and the food is tasty. I have had the yellow curry with fried tofu on the last few visits, but a coworker swears by their teriyaki... says its her favorite of anywhere she's been.  Portions are also very good here.  No one leaves hungry!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely incredible, and totally affordable for those who like Thai. I got the broccoli with peanut sauce, and my boyfriend got the pineapple curry. If you're getting one or the other go with the broccoli peanut sauce. It is absolutely delicious especially if you like pad Thai, but are looking for something a little bit lighter. I got it with rice, but maybe you can get noodles on the side. It's beautiful here, and the menus are stunning. The only thing was that the tables were a little bit sticky."}
{"text":"I've been to several Thai restaurants and this by far is my favorite. I enjoy the Pad Thai here, I don't like spicy and they make it just right.  It's always busy in here. Service is usually quick. Just enough food for the lunch portion. I would reccommend it."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Authentic! Variety! ^good wait staff, ^Lots of food for the price, ^small but comfortable seating, -Only downside is the location is a bit obscure. I recommend the red curry & white rice and the Pad Thai! YUM."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Thai food, and I'm excited to eat it anywhere I go. My friend that lives in Mesa says that people at her school really like it here, so I was thinking I was really going to enjoy their food too.   We ordered their pad thai and thai spicy fried rice. Their fried rice looked really good, but it wasn't as good as it might have looked. Their pad thai was the most different pad thai I have ever tried, and it wasn't in a good way. The pad thai tasted really acidic and didn't have that savory flavor that has come with all the other pad thais I've had everywhere else. I usually don't like to waste food, but I really couldn't force myself to eat it. Maybe it's just how they make it in their particular part of where they are from, but it doesn't fit my taste buds like other places do. It could be an off day for the chef because I've heard people enjoying it, but it just wasn't a good dish when I came to eat. The service was good which made it nice, but just be forewarned about the food."}
{"text":"Great little place. Good lunch and dinner menu - very friendly and cheap!!"}
{"text":"Wow has this place gone down hill.  We've been going here for years and used to recommend it to everyone.  The last two times have been awful.  Given, the red curry is still tasty but tonight's food came out at different times and each dish was literally slammed on our table, spilling each meal.  The service has been so rude lately that I felt like I was bothering the waitress by just being there.  Oh, and forks and water would have been nice to receive on the first ask.  I really hope they start changing their approach to customers or they will feel the same closure as their neighbors."}
{"text":"I was craving Tom Yum so decided to give this place a shot. We ordered the chicken satay to start and I liked it. My picky burrito-obsessed daughter ate it, too. My soup was exactly what I had been craving, also. Had all the perfect flavors that I love in Tom Yum. My fiancé ordered the BBQ chicken (although he's super snobby about his Thai BBQ) and he really enjoyed it. I tried it too and it was great. The staff was really friendly, which was also nice. We will definitely be back. I still want to try the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Finally, a place when u order hot... It comes hot! In fact, I think a little too hot for me (but that's because I'm probably pregnant ;-) had a take out order, was ready before estimated time! And nice lady at the counter!"}
{"text":"This Thai food is the best I have had in the east valley.  I've ordered from here a dozen times and have never been disappointed.  The amount of food you get is enough for a couple meals for me. The rangoons are pretty amazing, too.  I'm not a big fan of red curry, so if I'm in a curry mood I'll go with the yellow. If you call in your order for pick-up and they say 10 minutes, it's 10 minutes, at the most.  They are very friendly there.  I've never dined in before, but the place is really cute. I love all the trinkets. Some day I'll dine in. :P"}
{"text":"By far the best most authentic Thai food in the valley so good.  The pad Thai was so flavorful and good ant the panang curry was good as well. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"We were the only customers, which tends to make one a tad nervous, but the service and food did not disappoint.  We got the fried wonton - and it might be my favorite Thai appetizer ever... chicken / peas / corn / carrots in tiny fried wonton triangles with a sweet orange dipping sauce - just wow.  I got my stand-by Thai dish - the Pad See Ew with pork, which was equally tasty.  Simple, fresh ingredients make all the difference, and this is right up there with the best Thai I've ever had.  Never a bad thing when you can get a nice cold glass of Thai iced tea to wash it down.  Well done!!"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai place I have come by. Very small and cozy inside. I love their Pad Thai! Great spicy levels to choose from as well. They do great take out too! They fill an entire to go box filled with Pad Thai whenever I order.  The staff is amazing and so sweet too, which just makes it better!"}
{"text":"This spot is my goto joint for some delicious Thai fried rice fix. I go here at least twice a month sometimes more during lunch hours during work week, Would recommend anyone that like fried rice to try them out."}
{"text":"What a cute little place!  The menus have an unique and innovative look. OK, that was the positive part. The negative part?  There wasn't anything negative either. This was your Valley of the Sun standard cookie cutter menu with right down-the-middle execution. In short, average in every way. If you want to be blown away, don't go here. If you want acceptably prepared Thai style food, this is your place."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Unbeatable lunch specials and consistency is what brings us back. I've tried almost everything on the menu and it all rocks!! Small place but big value!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Thai restaurant!  Love the food here!"}
{"text":"My Girlfriend is 100% Thai and her mom makes the best Thai food ever.  I must say this place is on par with hers.  I love the Pad Ke Mao, Thai Fried Rice, Tom Yum, and Green Curry.  The only thing I don't like is how sweet their Pad Thai is but I'm sure you could just order it less sweet."}
{"text":"i get the red curry thai hot( just dont ask for thai hot AND THEN SOME...was numb the whole next day ha ha) and my wife gets the  pad thai mild. always very good and the owners are very nice.we always leave out of there with a couple thai iced teas which are very good also."}
{"text":"My go to place for bomb pad Thai and drunken noodles! I like hot and chicken or beef. SOO good!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai ever! Love the curry and the pineapple fried rice. Been coming here for a long time and it's always consistent."}
{"text":"I love trying hole in the wall family owned places! And this place didn't disappoint. Such good food. I love their curries and have found that their spice level fits well with what you order. Usually I'm disappointed on the amount of heat I ask for. For the amount of money you can't find a better spot!"}
{"text":"To quote my dining partner. The Tum Nak Thai BBQ chicken makes him want to marry a Thai lady so he can have this chicken every day. I come here regularly and love when new people fall in love too. Great little joint in Mesa."}
{"text":"Really decent place for thai food in AZ. I like that it is a small place. The family that owns it is super nice. Definitely my favorite dish is the pineapple fried rice. It has a lot of pineapple chunks in it and it has a good flavor. Their Tom Kha soup is pretty good too. Their fried banana dessert with ice cream is really yummy. They give just enough so you aren't overwhelmed by the fried banana. They also have very cheap lunch specials. Pad thai is only ok. Not the best I've had."}
{"text":"My hubby and I eat here almost once a week and I refuse to eat Thai anywhere else...at least in Mesa.  We always do take out...cheaper that way. So I don't know how good they are as far as service, etc but we've never had any problems with take out.  The food is excellent!  I usually get yellow curry with chicken and my husband gets pad Thai extra spicy.  Their pineapple fried rice is yummy too!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it zero stars!!!!!  Why oh why? I rarely review! But my girlfriend is from Thailand and after living with her for the past year I know what great Thai is!! Since she was working and wanted to surprise her with Thai food I decided to order from here. Well when I called and I did explain why I was calling and told her please make it good cause she will know.... well I dropped off her food and brought my home which I did order pal ke mow! Drunken noodles!!   I get home and it taste so bland and no flavor! For a soup tom yum and a plate of Drunken noodles 21.00$  Are you serious for this!! Then it says it's open till 9pm and I call and call and no answer!!! Please save your money and stay away from this fake horrible place!! I feel so cheated!! My dog is eating the food!!"}
{"text":"Cute decor, friendly staff.  I ate the pad thai and hubby th free yellow curry, medium hot.  He said the sauce was spot on.  My pad thai was very flavorful.  Sometimes people are shy with the fish sauce but not here. It was yummy"}
{"text":"This little place is great. I always wondered if it was good and they usually have a lot of cars out front during dinner time. I stopped in and asked for the best noodle dish. I went with the one they suggested and had shrimp for the protein. It was so amazingly cooked and seasoned that I came back a few days later and tried it with the chicken. It was great."}
{"text":"Best pad sei ew in the valley hands down. Small place, but family run with great decor. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I met a group of friends here for the $6 lunch special.   When you first walk in, you enter the dining area, and then the register is in the back. I arrived first, so I wasn't sure where to go as there were no servers or a hostess. There were some customers waiting for their food in the back at the register/counter so I headed back there and they told me to just put my order in at the counter. I ordered the red curry and said that it was \"for here\" then sat down. One of my friends showed up and sat with me and asked where she should order - I told her I had no idea and we just took a menu since no one working at the restaurant was to be found once again. Eventually the man who had taken my order came to our table and took my friend's order. About 10 minutes later her food came, but mine didn't. Then it came out to go - including with plastic silver ware, etc.   The rest of our party showed up so we moved to a larger table (most of the restaurant is 4 top booth seating). It was hard to get the server to bring me water, etc.  (I guess because my order was \"to go\"?), even though I had already paid and tipped well over 20% (eating in amount).  I have to disagree with Anthony - the level of spice was not even white person spicy - it was just not spicy at all. The only person who seemed happy had ordered their food \"Thai hot.\" My red curry was ok, not disgusting but not as complex of a flavor profile as Thai should be. The curry was also very saucy with few veggies/ meat.  I'd give it another shot though, since it might have been a fluke as they seemed understaffed."}
{"text":"I'm sad to report this is simply the worst Thai food I've ever had. I ordered the Green Curry with Tofu and I'm shocked by how bland it is. I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Never had Thai before the soup was very good I had the pepper steak it was delicious did the medium he sat hot enough the chicken pad was even better also tried the coconut chicken that was tasty also. Can get a little hectic in there when all the tables are full but over all great good from this little place"}
{"text":"Love this thai joint. I've been here for lunch and dinner many times. They actually own another sister restaurant on Southern and Higley near Quiznos. Anyways, this place is the place to go if you got a thai fix. It will definitely satisfy your cravings for curry, pad see ew, pad thai, and those other Asian flavors. Thai food in my opinion is generally spicy and has a lot of curry, oyster sauce, and fresh veggies which I like. I've never had anything bad here, so I would recommend to try everything from soups to noodles to rice dishes.   Great place for take out as well. It usually takes them 15 mins to whip up whatever you want and prices are very moderate."}
{"text":"We got there about an hour before they closed.  The service was OK, but the food could've been better.  Probably won't be making this my next Thai favorite!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for 8+ years and they never disappoint! I absolutely love this place it's a hidden gem in Mesa. I've taken so many family and friends here and turned them into Thai food lovers after taking them here. Their food is always fresh and hot when it comes out. You never have to wait too long to be served your food it's made pretty fast on even some busy nights. They are family owned as well and completely authentic. Their prices are the cheapest prices around as well. Their red curry is by far the best red curry! Love this place and hope they continue to thrive and do well."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. It is by far the best Thai restaurant in the valley. I highly recommend the Pad Thai or Yellow Curry."}
{"text":"Tum Nak serves food that will take you're taste buds to flavor country."}
{"text":"Ok here it comes. I am finishing this review as one of my other reviews was criticised based on the fact that i gave one star reviews to two places ( a sample size of two !)  This place i gave five star as its just yummy right from service to quantity to promptness and to taste. I dont purchase Thai food in Tucson anymore as I wait to drive down to Mesa and get like 8-10 dishes from Tumnak Thak and keep it in cool infridge.   The owner is very couteous and wait time is very short. The food is just tremendous and for such low cost , the quantity is for two people in every dish!"}
{"text":"Great little family-run Thai joint.  Very small inside, but nicely decorated.  The food is prepared with a lot of care and the ingredients are very fresh.  The Thai Fried Rice is excellent, as are most all the dishes.  Beware of the spiciness--medium here is like hot at other Thai joints.    My wife and I will be regulars."}
{"text":"Good Thai food at a good price.  This place is comfortable with plenty of space.  I was here for a late dinner and several tables were empty.  The menu was good.  The service was lacking as is typical for Thai places in general.  I asked for lime for my water, but they didn't have lime, so lemon would do...it never came.  Of the three servers here, they only stopped by after I had finished my meal to drop off the check.  I ordered my meal spicy but it was easily bearable.  My pineapple fried rice dish had way too much rice in it and not enough real food.  I was pleasantly surprised to find fish cakes on the menu...but they had very little taste even smothered with cucumber sauce which also had very little taste.  I'll keep looking for better...but this place is good."}
{"text":"I am extremely picky about Thai Curry, and since moving here my wife and I hadn't been able to find a place with suitable curry. Until Tum Nak! This place absolutely nails everything that is right about Thai Curry: the creaminess, the balance of spice and salt, the sticky rice. I was thoroughly impressed and will be returning often. Plus, the lunch specials are under $6, which is incredible."}
{"text":"Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) are off the chain!!! You must order them. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. We love this place. Service is not incredible, but this place is affordable and the food is so good."}
{"text":"I want to like this place SO bad. I love Thai food and there aren't too many around. It's also a small, family own business, but it's just not that great.  I had high expectations walking in. There were a lot of people, the reviews were great, and it was personally recommended to me by picky palates own, Jenny Flake!  It was small and cute, with great decorations, and we were seated quickly It took a couple of minutes to be given menus and it took almost 10 minutes just to get drinks.     We ordered the chicken satay, mild tom kha soup, medium chicken pad thai, medium spicy fried rice, and the pineapple curry. It took quite a while for the food to come, no to mention, the chicken satay (appetizer) came out last.  Here are my reviews on each food item. Chicken Satay: Big meaty skewers of chicken, and was very juicy, but SERIOUSLY over salted. I could hardly eat it. This was probably the best of the 4 things we ordered, which is saying something. And while eating my second skewer, I discovered it to be RAW in the middle! Really?   Tom Kha Soup: Utterly disgusting. Ordered it based anothers review on here. It was super sour. And not just lemony, because I love lemongrass and lemon! But this soup was literally inedible and was like a sour warhead.  Pad Thai: It was really very sweet and also a bit sour. We took two bites and had to throw it out.   Fried Rice: Pretty mediocre. Just fried rice, really nothing special at all. Not horrible.  Pineapple curry: Pretty good. Would order the curry if I ever come here again.  We also ordered the coconut custard with sticky rice and it was just okay.  The service was really not great either. It took a while to get the waiters attention.   Really sad to write such a bad review. I think we just got unlucky, but you'll be taking chances coming here. I, for one, will not come back. :("}
{"text":"Tum Nak Thai is awesome I have never fallen so in love with Thai food said my 10 year old daughter! This is a keeper!!! TRY IT"}
{"text":"We are hardcore foodies from Los Angeles who have eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world and are just plain crazy about good food.  Considering that I live in a city that has world's largest Thai population outside of Thailand and eat quite a bit of Thai food, I am very hard to impress.  So with that, I have now eaten at Tum Nak Thai twice and have been impressed both times.  This is really well done and seriously tasty Thai cooking.  Mesa, you have no idea how lucky you are.   Phoenix foodies, you would do well to head here!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little place that's sandwiched in between a Starbucks and a Weight Watchers. I can only imagine how tough it is for the Weight Watchers people to keep walking if they get a whiff of the delicious scents emanating from Tum Nak.   Wife and I usually get pickup every other weekend, if not more often. We also like to take advantage of their lunch specials when we get the chance. Unfortunately, we've only tried a few items on their menu because they do them that well and after we found what we liked, it's tough to stray. I usually get the Pad Thai Chicken (hot) and my wife orders the Spicy Green Bean Chicken (mild).  The food is amazingly consistent and the service is always stellar which is a wonder in itself since they just have a couple of employees and the place always seems full.   If you're in the Superstition Springs area, skip PF Chang's and head here when you want a taste of Asia.  EDIT: The Weight Watchers people must not have been able to resist the temptation everyday. It's long gone from the complex."}
{"text":"Oh my GOD!!!!!.  The fried rice dish is amazing, red curry is superb and pad thai above average. U can't go wrong. They don't deliver but they do have pick up. The food came out fast and hot. Service was just right.  My favorite thai place in town."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Tum Nak Thai for about 7 years now. This is our absolute favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix area. The restaurant is a little small, so make sure to go at a slower time. The food is amazing, we get pineapple fried rice, chicken satay, yellow curry, and of course, sticky rice with mango! The only small complaint I have is that the portions of the chicken satay and sticky rice are very small for the price; wish they'd make them bigger! Otherwise, a must try authentic Thai Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delicious, inexpensive and friendly. The restaurant is cozy and always full. Since I discovered it a few months ago this also is my favorite takeout place."}
{"text":"Excellent food, our favorites are the Pad Thai, chicken satay and Spicy Chicken Fried rice.  Restaurant a little on small side to eat in, but they are quick.  We do take out quite often."}
{"text":"I adore this place. The people are wonderful and so is the food. We always get yellow chicken  curry and lately we have been getting the shrimp/squid tom yum soup. It's without a doubt our favorite thing there now. Your body will love it. Tastes great and good for you! We try to g at least once a week, but sometimes that turns into 5 or 6 times a week."}
{"text":"This is the perfect hole in the wall mom and pop shop with very convenient hours. I love their Tom Yum soup with chicken and the Lad Na with beef. I could eat here daily! My spouse is from China and his family makes a rice noodle dish with gravy and the Lad Na is a close replica when I can't have the real homemade deal. They do get busy during lunch and dinner but if you can always call and get a to-go order they are very fast I haven't ever had to wait more than 15-20 minutes and of course the family who runs the restaurant is very friendly. This is my go to!"}
{"text":"The food is very tasty and the staff is very friendly.  There is a lot of variety and the atmosphere is very cozy.  It feels like a secret hole-in-the-wall place.  I can't vouch for the authenticity of the food, but it's extremely tasty compared to the handful of other Thai restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"Tom kha with chicken was really good, better than the one that I've tried from the other restaurant. The tofu fried rice was very delicious.. Service was good. I like everything except the beef from my drunken noodles, I'm not sure if the meat was over cooked or something but it was hard."}
{"text":"$6 lunch specials? Crazy! The portions are very generous too, and service was very friendly.  I had the Thai fried rice, which included a hearty amount of chicken, rice, and veggies. It was delicious. It was such a big portion I needed a to-go box.  Drinks are also reasonably priced ($1.75 fountain drinks).  Definitely a good place for lunch if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in the East Mesa area.  We found this place years ago and just keep forgetting to share how yummy it is.  The service is friendly and authentic because it's a family run business.  My hubby's favorite is the Tum Yum Soups and all the Curry dishes. The papaya salad is fresh and with just enough seasoning. This place is so popular that there has been a Take Out order every 2 mins since we sat down 10 mins ago. Come and taste for yourself what great Thai food is all about."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance have been coming here for years. We have tried many different Thai food places in the valley but we always come back to this one.  It's family own and operated. All the food is delicious and the prices are more than reasonable. Place is clean and the service is great.   We plan to keep coming here as long as they are still open. Love the food! No Thai place compares!"}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointed with this place. Read all the good reviews and decided to give it a try for lunch last Friday. It's been open for a really long time so I figured it must be really good. First of all, service is not especially welcoming. It was uncomfortably hot and stuffy in the restaurant as well. On to the food...we ordered the fried wontons, I had the tom kha soup and my son had pad Thai medium. The wontons were really good, hot and fresh and the filling was not greasy at all. My son's pad Thai was ok, but it seemed very oily. The tom kha soup had a delicious broth and the chicken in the soup was flavorful and tender, but it had a lot of HUGE chunks of lemongrass and ginger that were really woodsy and inedible, of course. I've had this soup before and it seemed like these things were strained out before serving. Overall, the food was underwhelming, but I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of their Pra Ram...the peanut sauce is unmatched!! We frequent this place regularly for weekday lunchtime specials. It's a family run business with weird hours, so make sure you call ahead before going. Well worth the trip though!"}
{"text":"Cute little mom-and-pop shop. It's kinda tucked away, but once you find it it's cute & comfy on the inside. The service was efficient, attentive & friendly.  Lots of good options. We went for lunch & felt like we got a very good deal. The food was yummy. My only complaint was that my larb didn't have quite enough mint to my taste. My companion enjoyed pad tai although he said it tasted more sweet & sour, which is not what he was expecting."}
{"text":"My 15 yr old son & I thought we would try something out of our comfort zone and since neither one of us had ever ventured into the Thai Food world we thought we would give this place a shot. My guess is that this place is \"pretty\" good! Everything seemed very fresh & ordered to your heat preference. We started off with the crispy won tons stuffed with marinated ground chicken, served with sweet and sour sauce now these were pretty awesome, next we opted for a cup of Won ton Soup which was also pretty yummy. Our very young waiter made a few suggestions based on our lack of Thai experience, we complied and ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and the Thai Fried Rice. I honestly must tell you that although I believe other folks might fancy Thai food We did not like it AT ALL! The flavors were very complex too many things going on in my mouth & very spicy to boot ( we ordered the medium heat level). I will try & love lots of different flavors but just not sure I will be rushing back to Thai Food any time soon??  So with that said I will only give this Restaurant 3 stars but with reservation because it really wasn't their fault."}
{"text":"Not as impressed as the other reviews had me to believe. I had the Pad Thai which is a staple and should be awesome, but it just tasted super tomatoey. The chicken wasn't seasoned at all. Service was fast and the people are friendly, but this place doesn't really taste that authentic. They're menus are in the same folders they had in Thailand so that was cool to see."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The food is so delicious and every plate is made fresh.  I have not found another Thai place that can compare.   I would highly recommend this place over and over again."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food that I have ever had.  My seven year old daughter loved the food also.  The rice is amazing.  The portion size is perfect. The chicken and the pork is excellent quality meat.  The restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Awesome! First experience with Thai food and it was to die for. I had the pad Thai with beef. I did the mild but I could have done medium. The Thai ice tea with cream was yummy as well! Definitely worth a look"}
{"text":"Not a bad place... price was fair... food was good... okay. Drunken noodles good but Masama was thin and not sweet. No refills w water unless we asked but then again we are from east coast. Really a 3.5 but can't round up. I eat alot of thai food. It was good but not great."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai place.  Thai tea is delicious, I have tried all the curry's, the stir fry's, the pad thai I have yet to have a bad dish."}
{"text":"I've been to Tum Nak Thai so many times I lost count. My boyfriend and I usually get the same thing. He gets the number 40, which is some kind of noodles. They are really good, especially when spicy. I usually get their Pad Thai, extremely good. Extra peanut taste, how I like! Their Won Ton soup is great, and it's not mostly broth like some places. Egg drop soup is amazing, too! The portions are on the bigger side, but not huge. Should fill you up no problem!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are very particular about our Thai food. Having just relocated from Denver, we've become accustomed to a sweeter Thai flavor with exceptional heat. Since we've been back in Arizona, we haven't found a Thai restaurant that satisfies the sweetness and the heat like we're used to - that is until Tum Nak Thai. Their heat indexes are lower than usual they were able to accommodate both of us and hit the heat burst without destroying the flavor of each dish. I ordered pad thai and my husband ordered red curry. Both dishes had large portions and came out very fast. We had barely finished the egg rolls (which were piping hot and delicious) when our entrees were ready. The service was friendly and impeccable and the restaurant decor and setting was higher end. The pictures online do not give it justice. It really is a beautiful place. The price was shockingly low for the amount of food we ate. We only spent $25 for both entrees and the appetizer. We will definitely be returning again."}
{"text":"The staff is great, the quality of the food is high, and the prices are very fair. I'm picky about eating Thai food. And this place hasn't let me down yet. The attention to detail by the owners shows real pride of ownership. Give them a try and you will be happy!  The pineapple fried rice is outstanding. That said, everything I have ordered has either been above average or excellent!"}
{"text":"Very delicious! The staff is friendly, food is delightful, and service fast & observant. I'll definitely be back!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Since I ordered takeout, I can only speak about the food. Although I did get a glimpse of the inside when picking up my lunch order and this place was adorable! I loved the decor and it was conveniently located within a complex on Baseline. As for the food, I ordered the chicken yellow curry which came with a spring roll and rice.  Appetizing, good portion size, and fairly priced. 2 star deduction as it didn't wow me--I've definitely had better Thai food however this was good for what you get. I'd definitely come back to maybe try another curry or pad Thai. I wouldn't write this place off just yet."}
{"text":"We have been here before and the food was good, last time the food was bland and the service was really slow.  It took 30min to get egg rolls that had almost no filling.  The Tom ka soup had too much fish oil so it was super salty and the hot basil was over cooked and cold.  The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is we had 4 star food a few years ago when we were here."}
{"text":"It's pretty tasty thai food, we ordered spicy thai fried rice, beef salad, pineapple curry, and lad na. I really want to give this place 3.5 stars because it was better than A-OK, I'm just not a fan of thai food in general.. I mean I like it but I never love it.  For those who really like a variety of flavors this is the place for you! Every bite was filled with flavor, I always think things are too salty because I have a sensitive palette but my boyfriend and roomate thought it was fine.    Thai fried rice- Full of flavor, comes with bamboo shoots kind of weird if I knew I would opt out of the bamboo.  Other than that very tasty   Beef salad-  I was only disappointed because the beef is cooked well done, normally in thai beef salad the beef is seared, leaving it very tender.    Pineapple curry- My first few bites were good but after a while it got too salty and overwhelming. If it was a tad less salty I would have been more satisfied.   Lad na- I really liked this, though I am use to Lad na not swimming in brown gravy.    I will be back to try some other dishes.  I feel like I need to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Not the best of Thai foods that I have had. Only been here ones the place is gorgeous but the food is so so."}
{"text":"- Tom Yum soup: full of flavor and had a nice freshness to it   - Cashew Nut Plate w/chicken: When the cashews still have that little crunch and you get that little tickle at that back of your throat from a dish being perfectly spiced, you know you're eating something special.  - Pad Kee Mao w/ pork: Good flavor, the pork was tender, and the noodles weren't sticking together as you find in a lot of lesser versions of pad kee mao.  Overall, I was very happy that this place was recommended to me by a friend of a friend."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, very fast services with a good amount of food for a decent price, I come here maybe once a week."}
{"text":"Oh so yummy!!! Amazing Thai food. Watch out fleshed wanting to add spiciness. Their hot is SUPER HOT!! Choose mild of you natural like spicy hot food. Such a great place."}
{"text":"First time I've had Thai and I'm a fan!! Great lunch specials!"}
{"text":"I had Thai coffee and thai fresh rolls. It was good. The vegetables were fresh and delicious. Plans to visit again."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! My family ordered to go and we got Pad Thai, Pra Ram, and Chicken Panang. Though the Panang was a little on the, \"a little too spicy,\" side, the sauce itself was great. The pad Thai was ah-mazing! I've never had better, but there was less meat than I expected. Still, very yummy! Pra Ram is my boyfriend's favorite & Tum Nak Thai did not disappoint!   In our order, they forgot to add the peanut sauce to the Pra ram, which is why I'm giving them one star less. The woman at the front of the store was rushing everything, even ordering on the phone & if they would've taken their time, I bet there wouldn't have been a second trip back, to get the peanut sauce.   The food was delicious and I'm glad I've found a great Thai restaurant by my house."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was excellent, order hot though because medium barely had heat. Reasonable prices, good service too. Only negative was getting waiters attention when I needed some chile sauce to heat it up but I was there during busy lunch hour. I look forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, fast & friendly service, and very reasonable menu prices. Pickup or dine in, you can't go wrong with this place to satisfy your Thai craving."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food place in the valley. The Panang and Massaman curry are out of this world. If you get it hot and spicy it's done perfectly where it gives the meal a consistent kick, but never to the point where it's overwhelming. They have the food ready fast when you call for take-out. The rest of the menu we've had is good, but the curries really stand out."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!!! They have big portions for the price! Super friendly staff and clean environment. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, but we like the food at Mint Thai a little better. I ordered my child's soup mild and forgot to ask for all my food medium and he didn't ask me, so I got mild. No one came to check on us even when I looked to get their attention. I had to go up and request more napkins, a check, togo containers and a way to add spice to the leftovers."}
{"text":"This place is fairly new and right around the corner from me. I ordered the won ton soup as usual. It was excellent. (I always request extra cilantro - I no longer have to because they know now how I like it) The Hot Basil is pretty much my regular meal there. I ask for Thai hot and is usually comes just right. The cashew nut with chicken is very good as well. My wife got the pineapple fried rice. It was ok. Not my favorite fried rice. But what throws them over the top is they have Pepsi. Not Coke. Highly recommend this place as one of the best Thai in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Super poor experience. There during busy lunch rush. Ordered Pa Nang chicken lunch. After 25 minutes they delivered curry flavored water with a little shrimp and no coconut milk. It was disgusting. I flagged the server, handed it back, and then they ignored me for next 20 minutes. I paid for ice tea and left, never to return."}
{"text":"Really good food. The place is hidden in a strip mall and it's pretty small inside but the menus and decor are really cute. Excellent service.  My friend inhaled his pad thai which he said was really good. I got something similar to drunken noodles and it was so good and the beef was super tender. My hubby got noodles too and asked for them thai extra hot and boy did he regret that! It lit him on fire. I'll have to try the curry next time."}
{"text":"Clean and cute.   Oh yeah and good food.  Service is pretty good, a little slow when they get busy, which is a lot because it's not very big.  They have wooden menus!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service was so slow I am pretty sure I turned 100 before my food arrived. People who arrived after us got their food before us and the staff hardly even noticed us. My boyfriend and I both ordered spicy food, I did medium (wanted an easy spice night) and my boyfriend ordered Thai hot. Both of these dishes came out without any spice added.   The service wasn't that great, which is the biggest reason I am giving a low rating. It's difficult to enjoy a place when you see groups larger than your own (we were only two people) get served their food before you. I also had a small portion of food that was served to me. My boyfriend had a large portion but I could not eat any of it because it was chicken. :(   The food here does taste good so if you're fine with very slow service where you won't get paid attention to, glasses won't get refilled, etc. go for it. Just do not have any plans for later that night.   I remember this is why my family and I stopped coming, because the service went downhill even though their food is excellent."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week. I've been going here for over 6 years and the quality has never changed. I really look forward to eating here. I've had Thai from many places but this is what I compare them all to!"}
{"text":"Thought about giving it a four because we waited for a long time since they are not very organized with their waiting list (they don't have one) and even once we sat down it was still another hour before we got our food... However, this is by far the best Thai food in town! I can't wait to go back to try more dishes. Just don't plan on going at busy times, like Friday nights :-/"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. My son spent a summer in Thailand and swears this is authentic. I just love the food and the people. The best service and amazing food. Have been eating here for at least 5 years. Best curry around. You can't go wrong with either red, yellow or my favorite, masaman curry."}
{"text":"When you eat Thai food and crave it so badly the next day - that is success!   I've eaten here twice and every time, I just want it for the rest of the week. Good ratio of vegetable, protein and noodle/rice, and the heat is exactly the way you want it! (We do prefer \"hot,\" we're not cool enough for \"Thai hot.\")  Overall you can't go wrong with this welcoming and delicious restaurant. I recommend the Tofu Thai Fried Rice and Pork Pad See Ew. Both are bomb.com!"}
{"text":"My go-to Thai place here in Mesa. Really flavorful Pad Thai but most of the dishes are a little lacking in veggies. The Tom Kha soup is super strong, but classic. The Hot Basil is great but more watery than I am used to. I ALWAYS get the mango sticky rice, soooo good!!! Red curry chicken is my favorite Thai dish but I prefer it to be sweeter than how they make it here. The place itself is super cute, they did a great job with the atmosphere and the family that owns it is super friendly. Great service, great food, would recommend!"}
{"text":"We always come here for the pad kee mao and Thai fried rice as often as our wallets permit and the food is ALWAYS undeniably the best. I'm Thai and I approve"}
{"text":"Very good small family run Thai place.  Hard to beat this place for your Thai fix.  Only drawback is that the restaurant is small so I usually get takeout, but it is nicely decorated inside. Pad Thai hot, wontons and wonton soup, hot and sour are my go to's. One of my favorites on the east side."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! The red curry is really good along with the pineapple fried rice and the Tom Kha soup is spectacular"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service. Love the Phad Thai and fresh spring rolls!"}
{"text":"We finally found a Thai place in Arizona that's awesome. We recently moved from the east coast we you can pretty much find any kind of authentic cuisine. This place is a definite winner!"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was really fantastic and it great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I love it here! We eat it probably once a week (we would eat it everyday if it were up to him!) The atmosphere is what you would expect from a small hole in the wall restaurant, quaint and unique. Service quality depends on how busy they are since it's such a small place, but honestly I've never had a bad experience that would make me not return. We've been coming for at least 5 years and they are usually pretty friendly. I would recommend the spicy green bean, teriyaki chicken, and wonton soup!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food restaurant I've been to in my life. No joke. Family owned, nice atmosphere, it can get crowded at times because its popularity, and of course the food is on point. My favorites/go-tos are pad thai, pad see ew, panang curry, and pineapple fried rice. A good appetizer I really like is their thai toast. My girlfriend's favorite restaurant, for one period of time we went twice a week almost. If I could give this place a 6/5, I would.  Overall: Service - 5 Food - 5 Wait time - 4 ~ 5 Cleanliness - 5"}
{"text":"I have never liked Thai food before coming here. My boyfriend convinced me to give it a try so I did with odd feelings but have never loved a place more! They have the freshest, most flavorful ingredients and have wonderful service, always friendly staff. Only downfall is how popular it is, which is great but if you don't like waiting or crowds I don't recommend coming on an evening or weekend. Sometimes Monday and Tuesday nights are pretty low key but people almost always crave it at the same time. Totally worth the wait if you don't mind though. Takeout is quick and delicious but getting the full experience is what makes it so incredible. I've been here 20 times in the last month! It's definitely a must try!!!!! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. Decor is very nice, and there's plenty of parking.  Stopped in for lunch with a group of friends. We weren't sure how to order (if you go up to the counter or if the gentlemen serving the dining room comes up to your table). He seemed a bit overwhelmed, so we each placed our order whenever we could get his attention.  Lunch prices are good, but the portions are small to match. I had the red curry, which was good, but not outstanding. I asked for it to be hot (4/5), but I thought it was medium at best. If you like food spicy, definitely ask for thai hot (5/5). The accompanying egg roll and sauce were good. It took awhile to get our checks and pay; I think during lunch, there should be more people seating, cleaning tables, etc.  I don't know if I would go back. It wasn't an amazing experience like others have had there. The food and visit were by no means bad, but I think I might explore other Thai restaurants in Mesa over a second visit."}
{"text":"The best thai in the east valley!!  I've been trying a lot of thai for find a good one, there is a lot of average to bad thai out there...Tum Nak Thai is awesome!  Everything I've tried is excellent and will make this my go to thai restaurant even though I live in south Chandler.  The pad thai, veggie delight and papaya salad are excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best thai places you can ask for. My favorite dish is the pineapple curry. Great service and friendly owners."}
{"text":"Great little Thai place!  We had one of the lunch specials and it was delicious!  Everything is cooked fresh and you can tell!  Plus the decor is the cutest!  Note:  Friday's at lunchtime are busy, be prepared to wait a few extra minutes."}
{"text":"Not good...terrible food, and even worse service.. The papaya salad definitely had mold in it and was then told by, whom I am assuming was a owner, that it was their recipe and that it was fine.. The pad Thai was mediocre at best...very dull and a single note of overly sweet and sour sauce.. Felt ignored the whole time after telling server about the papaya salad... AND TO TOP IT ALL OFF, the server tried to short my change over $10.. Pretty bold to tip yourself after a dining experience like that! Will never return, which is too bad because I love good Thai food, I highly suggest you try Thai Basil if you want a great Thai food experience! I would give no stars possible, you can give that one star to the beautiful statues put in front and the great decor."}
