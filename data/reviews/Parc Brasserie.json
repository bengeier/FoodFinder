{"text":"This is one of my new (new to me, anyway) favorite restaurants!  I went there for the first time for lunch and had the Croque Madame and it was delicious.  There was something about the bread, cheese, ham, and fried egg on top that just melted in my mouth.  The location is fantastic, just off of 17th Avenue in Mount Royal Village.  It wasn't too busy when I went so I sat on the patio and people-watched.  The decor is very European; I felt like I was in a small bistro in Paris.  I highly recommend Parc."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the potential to be 4 stars, but I'll have to come back to confirm. I came here with a group of six on a Thursday, and the restaurant was not very busy. This made it easy for us to hear each other, a feat that was difficult in the Borgo restaurant that formerly occupied this space, and whose decor finishes largely remain. A pastis, served in the proper glass and with a side of water started the evening nicely.

I then started the food with the ham and cheese croquettes, which are 3 for $9 (note that the Web site menu is not currently the same as in store). The texture of the croquettes was good, with a crispy golden exterior, and a smooth gooey interior. They were a bit small, and had sufficient filling flavor that they could have been stretched out a bit with more roux to provide substance. I was jealous of my table mate who ordered the Niçoise salad ($18?), which was a beautifully arranged salade composé with seared tuna and various clearly homemade fixings.

For the main course, the table was evenly split between halibut and the daily special of lamb. I was on the fish side, drawn by the menu's promise of a bouillabaisse broth and beans. Alas, the broth was only a tiny puddle in the bottom, and the beans' texture left something to be desired. The fish itself was rather bland, and could have used a good searing and a nape of beurre blanc to liven it up. Disappointing at $34. 

On the other hand, the lamb looked amazing! Undersold somewhat by the waiter, it had four meaty bones and *wild morels* and asparagus. This and the Niçoise  show that they are serious about food, but I unfortunately didn't experience this myself. The lemon tart, always a great test of a kitchen, was unremarkable, with a slightly underset curd and slightly dull acidity. 

Parc has a French purity streak to it that Is at once both admirable and annoying...like spelling \"expresso\", and the wine selection. I must say that the service was professional and excellent, in the best French tradition of simultaneous snootiness and deference. I'd like to give Parc another go based on the dishes I *didn't* have, though at these prices, probably when someone else is paying!"}
{"text":"Over hyped, over priced, and disappointing.  Very simplified bland version of bistro fare.  Desserts look like they were picked up at a roadside rest area diner.  I wish it was Borgo again, at least they did food right."}
{"text":"Comme ci comme ca. Parc has a beautiful atmosphere. Light and airy but a little echoey...making intimate conversation difficult. You are greeted with fresh bread, still warm, with butter. A delicious way to start the meal. My friend and I both ordered the steak frites. Maybe my expectations were too high but the frites tasted like warmed up frozen French fries accompanied by a salad dressing like dip. I ordered that flat iron steak. My steak was cold....the pat of butter on top of it remained firm. Our server graciously heated it up which improved the flavours greatly. The jus was delicious, the steak tender. 

The desserts were divine. The chocolate mousse was a decent portion, the lemon tart was stellar but quite tiny for the price. 

Over all, the meal was ok. Not horrible but not quite living up to the prices or the hype. A note on the service: attentive but maybe too much so. Our server insisted on clearing away cutlery while we were still eating and would often dash away before we could request more than the single sugar cube portioned to us with our coffees."}
{"text":"BIG TASTE 2016

Their big taste dinner menu was just amazzinggg. The $25 special menu featured: escargots, a gnocchi dish, and a rum cake dessert. Even though we were there for big taste, we were offered bread at the start, which was nice. 

The escargots were great, but the best part of this dish was the puree that was served with it. Have no idea what it consisted of, but it was the best. Then the gnocchi with crispy pulled chicken came out, and we were both very disappointed with the portion. It was VERY small for an entree, but the gnocchi was seriously well made & melted away in my mouth - sooo soft. The dessert was a simple rum soaked cake with cream. Doesn't sound like much, but I loved it & was left wanting more. 

The food & service were both great! But I did leave wanting more.. maybe that was the point? I think their regular menu items are probably better portion-wise, so I will definitely be back to try something off their regular menu in the near future =)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch there, atmosphere is beautiful definitely makes you feel like you're in a French bistro. However, the service was slow and unfriendly and after explicitly mentioning my food allergy my food came out incorrect - had to send it back after already waiting so long. Overall wasn't very impressed don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"poor service!!!
\"Oh you don't speak French? We are a French restaurant!\"
\" we are a French restaurant, we only serve French wine\"

I lost my appetite even before my order arrives...."}
{"text":"Welcoming, trendy and French are three words that sum up my first impressions of this restaurant. 

My boyfriend and I had our Friday night date here just last week and we had an amazing time! The food was delicious and the service was superb. What stood out to me about the service was that they had a separate bread server. The bread servers asked us if we wanted seconds! I thought that was super awesome, most restaurants only give you the one serving of bread. Next to that, our waitress was very attentive and very helpful. She made a wonderful suggestion on wine and food. I was definitely pleased!

I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant and would definitely recommend it! The ambience of this restaurant is great!

The food, was well presented and delicious! For appetizers we ordered the Foie Gras Torchon and
Escargots. The texture of the Foie Gras was similar to that of pâte and was firmer. Most of the Foie Gras that I have had in the past was more mushy/jam like in texture, so this was more of a surprise for me. The taste was melt in your mouth delicious. The escargots was also very unique, I personally thought that I would get a much more raw form of the escargots, but the escargots were hidden in the mushroom tart. It was tasty, but the escargots didn't taste like much...this is my first time having escargots so I'm not even sure what it should taste like! Nonetheless, it was delicious. 

For the Plats Principaux, we had the dinner special, Lobster Risotto and Porc. The Lobster Risotto was creamy and savoury. The risotto was cooked to perfection, you could feel each individual grain as you took a bite. The Porc was moist and tender. It also came with ratatouille and potato gratin. The potato was cooked in layers with a nice crispy top and soft lower layers. The ratatouille had a more subtle seasoning as to not overpower the taste of the porc and potato gratin. It definitely added a nice touch.

For dessert, we had profiteroles and madeleines. The madeleines were fresh out of the oven and had a refreshing lemon flavour. The cake was light and moist. The profiteroles were filled with ice cream. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a favourite restaurant of our's. Service is fantastic and the food perfectly French and lovely! I adore the Croque Madame and their salads are fresh, tasty, with tangy dressing. Tonight I had the beef tartare, which was fresh but could have had a bit more Dijon mustard. The fries were crispy and the aioli was a great compliment. I was a bit disappointed with my pork chop. Specifically, I would have preferred it whole instead of sliced for me... but mostly I wasn't impressed that it was a bit over-cooked, chewy, and lackluster on the seasoning. Saying that, the goat cheese was a fantastic accoutrement, so that almost made up for the pork. My husband found his duck confit was also a bit dry. My friend had the mussels and they were super fresh and buttery. I tried a few and they were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, great service, charming french feel. The creme broule is the best we have had and the latte was excellent. We came for desrt but will be back! Only  suggestion for improvement would be providing complimentary water."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is amazing and the menu includes the classics. The service is unbeatable for Calgary, too. The two appetizers, two entrees and dessert we ordered were cooked to perfection. Great wine list, too."}
{"text":"The food here was great!!! The service, not so much.  The waitress was AWESOME, as she was attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.   Unfortunately, they were understaffed.  I'm picky, and when paying for food, give me what I ask for.  They made a mistake on an order forgetting ingredients requested, so back to the kitchen.  The manager brought it back quickly, however, seemed to be annoyed, no apology.   They offer water, but it is not free.  It's their specially filtered water in a normal looking bottle.  You have to request tap water.  Waitress took out off the bill, with no issue.  Again, she was awesome.  The food was great.  My eggs had that dark lovely yolk and the bacon, double smoked.  Americano was great and the creme brulé, deadly.  A Caesar as a noon treat worked out well.  Prices are a little high, but expected.  4-5 stars would have been achieved if they got the order right and the manager cared"}
{"text":"Great for a nice dinner. The ambiance allows a nice conversation and maybe a good date. The service is very professional and the food is very tasty. I will come back.

Update: really good French cuisine. The menu is on the short side (1 page) though it's always a safe bet."}
{"text":"I came here for Big Taste, but I found out that during the weekend, the restaurant does not offer the Big Taste lunch. Not a big deal. I went on to eat the best vegetarian eggs benny. Seriously, this dish is spectacular. Everything was perfectly cooked, the egg yolk, the spinach and portobello mushrooms, the red onions and the fluffy English muffin.

The side of potatoes was fluffy and flavourful, made better with the hollandaise sauce. I would put that s#$! on everything! It made for a very filling meal. 

Service by Maya was lovely. She made a great recommendation and she let my friend and I sit and linger (in other words, did not try to push us out after we finished our meal).

If you want a nice place to brunch and don't want to wait in line, I would check this place out. I want to return and try dinner. 

The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the Kir Royale. Flat and the taste of the kir isn't as refreshing as Cassis' take on it."}
{"text":"Adorable Parisian Brasserie along the Mount Royal park area in Calgary: Tres jolie!

I joined some of my Expat friends from the Paris days there for dinner and there were moments where i had that bit of a feeling I was back in Paris..In fact, after splitting a bottle of wine, I was pretty sure I was...

We tried several starters:  The Shrimp cocktail- divine!  The Foie Gras-Rich! The gourgeres- little cheese puffs served piping hot in a little tin cup and paper, a la Parisienne!  Starters rocked.

We moved into entree land with the veal, served in giant chops in authentic cast iron pans- delicious!  I had the Salade Nicoise, which is personal favorite, and the tuna was ahi grade served with all the goodies- C'etait Bon!

Apres, nous avons pris la Tarte au Citron et le Mousse au Chocolate.  Marveilluese."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The items I've tried have all been amazing, the wine list is great, desserts lovely, even the cappuccinos are great (and are served with a tiny lemon biscuit).  The service is very good. All servers I've had have been very knowledgeable and helpful. It's even quite a beautiful restaurant in a perfect location...on the park in front of Mount Royal Village. It's one of my favourite spots in Calgary now.

My recommendations are, for brunch the brie stuffed French toast with a glass of sparkling rosé, for lunch the onion soup with the butter leaf lettuce salad.  For dinner my favourite so far is the veal with barley risotto."}
{"text":"Brunch is a treat with madeleines served warm and sugar dusted. Prettiest room overlooking the park. It's bright and relaxing, sparkly clean and delicious. Really happy experience -- from location and design and dish to dish.  Omlettes and french toast (brie stuffed believe me) rate right up there."}
{"text":"Above all else, our waiter made this a memorable experience - had jokes and one liners for days, a charming guy who did not have an off button.

Ambiance is relaxed and plenty of space here, bar height tables on one side and more formal tables in the front and the other side of the bar.  Food was all good, the beef tartare might have been the star of meal, but the second appetizer of pork belly (main dish ordered as an app) was eaten with speed and no complaints.  The beef tartare was just perfect though, large fist of a portion and sturdy baguettes to scoop the meat on and then down your throat with delight.  Entrees of pork shoulder and duck frittes did not disappoint, but would recommend the duck first.  The madellines were unreal, got a second order after devouring the first.

Will come back after exploring more of the area...."}
{"text":"I've had 2 experiences with PARC and they could not be more markedly different. 

1) First experience was absolutely fantastic. I went with a group of 8 people (I should point out that I did not arrange reservations this time) and we were treated extremely well. Staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful with food selection. Our server at the time was also a sommelier, so was able to assist with wine choices if needed. He was never pushy about our table ordering wine, however. Food this time was absolutely delicious. We had the French version of gnocchi (made with choix pastry). Absolutely amazing. We also had the tuna carpaccio/ceviche (I can't recall at this time). Also amazing. Some of the other dishes the other people at our table had were the steak options and the cassoule. They also had nothing but great things to say about the food. 

2) Unfortunately, my second dealing with PARC was nothing but absolutely dismal. After this extremely negative experience, I will not be going back to PARC. I had called about 3 weeks ahead to make a large reserveation for a bachlorette party. I emphasized on the phone that we did not need any sort of special arrangments, but that it was for a large party of 7. I was told by the hostess (I assume) that it would have to be approved by the Event's Manager and that he was not available. She said he would call me back in a few days. 

After the weekend, I had not heard anything from PARC, so I called again. I got the same response, \"sorry, but we are not able to make the reservation without approval from the Event's Manager,\". He was again not available, but this time the woman on the other end assured me that she would personally pass the message to him. 

After a week of no communication from PARC and only one week before the bachelorette, I call back and I get the same response. I asked if I could talk to anyone else to help me and I kept getting, \"sorry it has to go through the Event's manager because of the size of your party. I can't reserve anything until then.\" I explained my situation and the woman said she would talk to him tomorrow and he would call me back then. 

No word. Again. So the week prior to the bachlorette, I called back and asked to speak to the general manager. I explained my situation to him and the fact that I have been calling for the past 3 weeks to book a reservation and that I had been told repeatedly that my message would be passed to the events manager and that he would call me back. The General Manager apologized and then said that he couldn't help me with a table b/c I didn't book it early enough. Well, I had been calling repeatedly for the past 3 weeks? He said, unfortunately there just wasn't any room and he'd pass the message along to the events manager. Essentially, it sounded like a \"well, I'm sorry we dropped the ball on this one. Oh well\". I was and still am livid. If I hadn't the foresight to make a back up plan, we wouldn't have had a reservation for dinner during the bachlorette. While our party is larger than normal, it was not massive (we had 7-8 guests) and it was obviously easily accommodated in the past. My friends have told me that they've never had issues making a booking of 7-8 people before and have made it the week before. I guess they were just not interested in our business. 

I'm sorely disappointed, mostly because I know that they've been a great place to dine in the past. I was blown away by my first experience, but unfortunately not impressed by this last time."}
