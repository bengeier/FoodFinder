Long bone veal chop was SUPER!  Husband has Italian seafood feast and saint leave a drop....app was stuffed hot peppers, perfectly roasted.
Two glasses of wine, cappuccino and a warm B&B to top it all off!
LOVED IT AND RECOMMEND TOO EVERYONE-
Don't be discouraged by the neighborhood, it's all good!!!"}

{"text":"Incredibly poor decision to dine here. Wait staff person, tony was poor. Food was just okay, felt rushed through our dining experience and the place  was not busy (Friday at 7pm). Very unaccommodating chef when a request to substitue one type of pasta for another-seriously, they serve all types of pasta!
Don't bother wasting your time with this place."}

{"text":"Dined at Johnny's Bar Christmas Eve with my family.  I'm always a little leery of restaurants on holiday occasions like this because I know employees can flake out and not come in.  I know this is a Cleveland institution but it was my first time there.
Overall, the experience was a bit disappointing.  First, service was spotty.  Perhaps they didn't have enough servers but our server seemed a bit stressed.  We waited a considerable length of time before we got our beverages.  They ran out of water glasses; two members of our party didn't get them until half-way into the meal.  My mother's chair was old and wobbly; she requested another but was told there weren't any.  Though I was happy with my food, not everyone was.
Johnny's charges a lot with many of the entrees priced at north of $40.  With such a heavy price tag, they should step up their game a bit.  Buy some more water glasses; purchase some chairs that aren't close to breaking; and, have enough servers on hand.
Having said this, I do like the old world vibe of the place and I would give it another try."}
{"text":"Just not good for a $500 dinner .. clients from Chicago were excited and very let down and the waitress was rude and short answered.."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for an early birthday dinner this past Saturday. He had been here many years ago, but it was a first for me. The place is small and quaint on the inside. For starters, we ordered the special appetizer of stuffed calamari in marinara. The calamari was tender, however, the stuffing was nothing I would ever want to taste again. For our entrees, I ordered the beef tenderloin and lobster in puff pastry with chardonnay sauce. The meat itself tasted as if it had been reheated, as it was dry and had an off putting taste. The lobster was extremely fishy tasting and was macerated as if it had come out of a can. The amount of lobster equated to about a teaspoon, which was ok I guess because it was inedible. For the price, extremely disappointing. My daughter ordered the potato gnocchi with shrimp. Her dish was quite good. My husband ordered one of the specials for his entr√©e, the veal porterhouse, which he said was just ok. It was a simple, small veal chop at $40+. Very disappointed and we will not be back. Perhaps one should only order the pasta because their tenderloin and veal dishes were extremely lacking."}
{"text":"In Cleveland on business I went with a group of my clients to Johnny's Bar. The food was awesome! I had a veal chop on the bone and it was incredible. I am looking forward to my next trip to Cleveland to have another amazing meal."}

Bo the owner along with his lovely family really know how to make you feel welcome. I met his wife the two lovely daughters and 1 son. Thanks for the great peppers, veal chops, pasta and tasty drinks over my time in Cleveland. I hope to visit again real soon"}
{"text":"Sat outside under cover while rain came down; pretty nice ambience. Service was good, if slow, but the waiter said they were backed up. 

Appetizers were great. We split an entree, veal porterhouse, and it was overcooked (we hadn't been asked how to have it done) and the side potatoes were awful - like they had been suiting around. Salad was horribly overdressed 

I've always enjoyed the small plates, but the full meal sure wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"They were serving an 8 person table and totally ignored us, on our special occasion evening.. Said they were too busy and we needed to wait. The food was disgusting tasted warmed up and old covered in salt.. Sent back and was yelled at by the server.. She said she can't take anything off our bill even though it wasn't edible or even eaten.. The salad was the only thing that was good but since the tables are so small and our meals were warmed up in a microwave they took our salads mid-bite.. RUDE.. I would never suggest anyone to dine here and I will never go back. By the way our bill was 350$$ We all left starving and drove an hour home to make something ourselves.."}
{"text":"I've been avoiding writing this review, because Johnny's deserves a lot of details written about it, and I've just been too busy to do it.

I took my parents here on Friday night. It's in a really crappy part of town, right across from Lin's Omni Square, where I work part of the time. For the longest time, I wondered what kind of shady characters might be frequenting this bar across the street. Then I talked to a friend who told me that it was actually a restaurant, and a really good one at that.

The carpet is leopard-print. Okay, now that we've got that out of the way, we can move on.

The waitress we had was verrrrry knowledgeable about the specials. I was very impressed with how much she had memorized. The restaurant is very \"old school,\" yet the preparation (from my limited knowledge) seems very advanced and modern, with fresh ingredients and interesting sauces.

We all had pasta dishes, which seemed to piss off the waitress (because she mentioned it a bunch of times). I mean, first of all, pasta is my first choice at an Italian restaurant after chicken parmesan, and that wasn't on the menu. Secondly, everything was MAJORLY OUT THE ASS expensive. The cheapest thing on the menu (my order) was spaghetti and meatballs, weighing in at a whopping $16.95. My parents both ordered the egg pappardelle bolognese at $22.50 apiece. My husband got the extremely decadent seafood linguine, which was 26 bucks. Yikes. I don't even want to get into what the meat dishes cost, let alone the specials! $42 for a leg of lamb. Ugh. Of course, it wouldn't have been so terrible if I had been aware that it was going to be this way (and if my stepdad hadn't made a fuss the entire time). The website, of course, does not have prices, and when I looked here on yelp just a month ago, there were only two dollar signs next to the listing.

Of course we ordered dessert, which was amazing. Carrot cake, bananas foster, and hazelnut cheesecake. Yum.

I won't even tell you what the bill was. But we had a lot of leftovers and were happy to enjoy our reheated pasta over the weekend."}
{"text":"Great food and decor. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting the Cleveland area. 

Very good wine list. Knowledgeable waiters."}
{"text":"Food was good, but pretty expensive for what you get. Not sure why veal Parmigiana costs 37 bucks. It was not anything special."}
{"text":"Johnnies is one of the best dining experiences in Cleveland.  Excellent stacks and seafood.  It is always a pleasure to walk thru the door and be greeted the old fashioned way.  I love their seafood fettuccini. The management and staff are always there to meet your needs and make your evening or lunch wonderful!  They give that little extra that most places forget
Highly recommend for special occasions or dinner for two!"}
{"text":"Really have to ask....WHO IS the guy managing Johnny's on Fulton?  

The other couple we went with to dine her on Saturday, 11/12/11 were regulars at this location in the past.  I've been here once with my wife as well, and there is no issue with the food...it's top shelf Italian cuisine.  

However, this time around they lost our reservation - which happens - but man oh man, the GM dude running the place sure treated us like we were bums from the street looking for a free meal or something!

He started with a snotty tone and said, \"You called the wrong number.\"  Which is possible since Johnny's Downtown has a phone number with the same last 4 digits as this one on Fulton.  But the GM's tone was like, \"You called the wrong number, you stupid idiot.\"

He did spend 2-3 minutes looking things over to at least pretend to see what he could do...but they were packed and there was no getting us in.  OK, so he calls the downtown location and semi-confirms that's where our reservation really was.  But because we stood there for nine minutes trying to figure out what to do, he said it was too late, we lost our reservation at the other location.

When I asked him why, he said, \"Because you're HERE.\"  Once again with the whole \"You stupid brainless idiot\" tone.  He also shrugged his shoulders while he was saying it, just to add a little extra flair to his insulting demeanor.

Moreover, I heard this mental giant of dedicated customer service actually use the word \"idiot,\" referring to a customer while talking to some guy at the bar.  Not sure if this other guy was an employee or a customer, and I'm not sure I was the \"idiot\" the GM was talking about, either.  Could have been some other \"idiot\" that asked some \"stupid\" question customers sometimes ask, like, \"when will our table be ready?\" or something similar.

Wow.  

Further, the hostess on duty at one point said, \"pay no attention to him, he's evil,\" as if she's experienced this kind of thing from him before?  

Next stop for me is writing a letter to Johnny's ownership.  Unless this is the guy that owns the place, of course.  By the way, we wound up at Felice in Shaker Hts instead  that night.  Had a great meal (seared duck breast with serrano ham mac n cheese and a cherry reduction sauce) at probably 40% less than the prices at Johnny's...

{"text":"This place was a find. Great local owned long time establishment with great food, killer wine list, and eating at the bar while chatting with the owner. Had a great time everyone enjoyed the food. And they have not 1, not 2, but 5 Amarone wines to pick from the wine list. My veal steak with lobster on top was awesome. Neat place. Yes, a little pricey but they have earned it."}
{"text":"Do not let this place fool you by its location. I will be honest and say that I was very skeptical when I was taken here as a \"surprise.\" The location is kind of sketchy and from the outside it just looks like an average dive bar but walking in immediately, there's an entire different vibe. A very classy and romantic place to take your loved one. Our waiter was very kind and had a great sense of humor, very accommodating to our taste buds and what we would enjoy. Starting off with the mozzarella balls - just thinking about them makes my mouth water. One of the best I've ever tasted! And for the entree I got the shrimp, mussel, scalloped pasta and it was also superb. You can taste in each bite that they get there stuff fresh and use only the freshest ingredients. The bottle of red Malbec was not a disappointment either. You can tell only the top of the top come here because they know what's good. Learn from my mistake and don't judge a book by its cover, if you come here you will certainly put this on your list of top restaurants to come back to."}
{"text":"On the positive-most importantly, the food was delicious.  It fit the style of the place.  Wasn't trying to be modern, pretentious or too creative.  Good, fresh ingredients cooked right served by knowledgeable servers.  We ordered the stuffed veal chops.  A little overcooked for my liking with only a hint of pink.  They did not offer an option which is probably normal for veal.  The demi-glace over top was delicious.  Side of potatoes and greens were perfect.  Also, we ordered the fettucine with red pepper sauce, rabbit sausage and mushrooms.  This was delicious but with a bit too much sauce.  The noodles were firm, warm and not stuck together - very hard to get all three of those right on busy nights. The salad was good but the goat cheese was a bit too salty.   The nebbiolo wine which came recommended based on my interest, was nailed by our waiter.

The atmosphere was awesome - old timers having fun and enjoying the energy and noise while early twenty somethings sat at white linen tops acting accordingly.  All this in the midst of one of the most blighted areas of Cleveland.  

The one negative was the ridiculous wait.  8:30 reservation got us seated at 9:45 with entrees arriving at 10:45 with little concern from the staff."}
{"text":"Amazing food here!  It's the best place I have eaten in Cleveland. Not sure if each location is different, but we went all out at the Johnny's Bar on Fulton, had the appetizers, entree's and desert.   The reason we went here was because my fiance's uncle said when he is in Cleveland he always stop here, so we went out with him to dinner there.  The tiramasu was the best I have ever eaten!!! I usually dont even like tiramasu.  We had ordered lamp chops,  some bolognese and steak... everything was sooo good and I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Food and service is fantastic as always. It's my favorite spot in Cleveland. Consistent!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from NY and this place was recommended. It was a last minute call to go so I contacted the restaurant to see if they took reservations which they did and accommodated us (party of 3). We arrived and noticed there was valet parking (we grabbed car service to location). The restaurant itself has a nice bar upon entering and the place has an intimate setting. We sat in the side room where lovely murals decorated the space. Our server, Kelly, was sweet, attentive, quick and pleasant. Food was delicious and there is a nice wine list to compliment the meals. Johnny's Bar has an old school vibe but cozy. Great choice for our dinner that evening. Go treat yourselves. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We actually went there a while ago because of recommendations from co-workers and since they were on restaurant.com. 

Can't remember all the details, all I remember is I really want to go back and try their entire menu.  All the savory items were phenomenal, but IMO the best thing we had that night was their chocolate cake (and im pretty picky about my cake).  

I do gotta say though- this is a not a diet friendly place.  It is great for a night where you want to feel uber special, they take care of you well at Johnny's, and it's well worth the calories and price:)

Also, the decor is awesome gaudiness."}
{"text":"I have a friend who consistently rates this as his favorite restaurant in Cleveland. I am now convinced he is on Drugs. Yes, I like the charm and old school Italian vibe. After that...I am not sure what I like.

The salad was depressing. C'mon, put a little love into it. Don't serve me lettuce from Costco dump some dressing on it and call it a salad, I can do that at home.

The fried mozarella was in the shape of squares, a refreshing change from sticks. But the cheese was whatever. The marinara sauce was light and delicious. Thus the restaurant has earned 3 stars...really.

As you know I am a vegetarian. Surprise, no options for a main course. I asked for Pasta with Marinara and Shitake Mushrooms, mainly because I noticed they had all three options on the table. They added Broccoli (yuck), but that was easy to pull off. The killer was the rigatoni. For $30 I'd like something more than a half a box of rigatoni out of the box. For real. 

The low down, is it is easy to spend $144 for a couple and leave with a who cares feeling. For all the hype I'd expect homemade pasta and love, real love, put into the food. If you want that, go elsewhere...maybe Dante's."}
{"text":"Simply outstanding! As usual, as always. Love it here. Truly amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Johnny's is a neighborhood landmark that unlike many businesses in Greater Cleveland, has withstood generations of urban decay and continued to thrive! This is a quinessential 'old neighborhood' restaurant, a classy joint to say the least, a place where the interior decor is set in the 1970s... and it's marvelous! The food is definitely top notch, Northern Italian, cusine that focuses on classical dishes and time honored favorites, such as the Egg Parpardelle Pasta, or the Long Bone Veal Chop! Sure, the menu prices aren't going to accommodate those on a limited budget, but the quality and flavor that goes into the food here makes it all worth the experience - even if it's only once - it will be a memorable one!"}
{"text":"This Cleveland classic deserves nothing less than five stars. Food and service was outstanding. 

My boyfriend and I have had Johnny's on our list for a long time, so we decided to splurge during the holiday season and give it a try. 

This feels like a bar from the 1930s. No frills. Old school, classy joint. At the bottom of the menu, it requests no cell phone usage! What?! Don't tell but still checked in on Yelp. 

We started with a bottle of wine. Ripasso. Excellent and reasonably priced. 

My bf got the long bone veal chop, stuffed with ch√®vre and leeks, topped with shiitakes. Holy moly was it  a tender, umami bomb! I had the Chilean sea bass, which was crispy on the outside, but so moist. Perfectly prepared. 

Tiramisu for dessert with espresso was a fabulous way to round out the evening. 

Need to give a shout out to Our server, Linda, because she was amazing! She made our evening. No really. I mean it! 

I will admit that the prices make it a special occasion place, but man- I can't wait to head back soon!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the service was good.  There is a valet which is good since its not really a neighborhood id like to park in.  Good but a little pricey in my book."}
{"text":"It's been about a decade since I've last visited Johny's on Fulton, no particular reason, just haven't gone near Downtown as often these days. Everyone from the Maitre de  to the waiter, bartender were professional and friendly. Complimentary valet service makes it easy to enter and leave the restaurant .

The bartender was more than willing to take a stab at a unique cocktail he wasn't familiar with and did a nice job at replicating it, the wine list was well thought out with a fair amount of choices in both whites and reds, pricing was average on these choices 

There were about 3 specials that night which the waiter provided excellent answers to our questions. We went with what I suspect are two of their most popular choices on the menu, both our entree's came with a salad and my fianc√©'s came with a side as well. Her choice, the potato crusted grouper was excellent, while the pricing seemed a bit on the high side for this dish, the portion was LARGE, and it was prepared perfectly, tasting fresh and the crusting was moderate not overtaking the mild fresh flavor of the grouper. Considering the portion size and the salad and side which were included the pricing was very fair at about $35.00.

On to my entr√©e, I chose the Italian feast which was a variety of seafood in a red sauce with linguini,  one of their most popular dishes I was told. There were scampi, scallops, mussels and shrimp included in the menu description, all were present including surprisingly a nice chunk of the grouper! Two nice size scampi...plenty of medium size scallops ... about a 4oz piece of grouper( which was NOT in the menu description, so perhaps depends on what is fresh in the kitchen that night), some mussels and shrimp in a very NICE marinara style sauce with good flavor and consistency, the linguini was cooked nicely also ...A VERY GENEROUS portion and at $29.00 including a salad was extremely FAIRLY priced. 

We decided on splitting a dessert and went with bananas foster....again the portion was HUGE, the caramel sauce was good, the bananas could have used a bit more time being heated, but it was good enough I would order it again after trying a few other choices. 

Since I've forgotten the choice which kept me from giving this visit 5 stars, let me reverse to the appetizer we ordered, stuffed peppers with ground veal, they were average based on others I've had, they weren't cooked quite enough for my palate, could have used more sauce  and the veal was stingy, which considering the other portions were extremely generous is surprising, perhaps an oversight of the kitchen that evening. 

We will definitely be making a return visit before another decade, the food overall was excellent,  our bill came to about $125.00, including we each had a nice glass of red wine,  which was fair considering the portions and overall quality. Throw in their complimentary valet, a salad included with both entree's and pricing is not an issue  by most standards. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I eat at Johnny's frequently. I  love that this cozy, high end restaurant is located in the heart of one of Cleveland's worst neighborhoods.  It's like a diamond in the rough which is unique and enchanting.  Johnny's Bar is cozy, and offers perfect ambiance for a romatic dinner or a business dinner. The staff is great and Ricky is one of the best waiters in town.  However, I have never loved the food here.  It's always lacking to me.  I eat at fine establishments all over the US and I've never left Johnny's thinking about my meal.  The ambiance and atmosphere is far more memorable.  All of the dishes are high end and sound great, but I never taste anything and go \"wow\".  If Johnny's could improve their dishes, I'd give them a 5."}
{"text":"I have not been  at Johnny's Fulton location in several years. Yet, it is same excellent service and Exceptional food ."}
{"text":"I miss the Johnny's of old great food reasonably priced in a funky restaurant. The food is very good and the service exceptional, the interior is stylish. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had one of the most amazing meals of my life here.  It's been a few years since I've been...but it was wonderful.  Not cheap.  Excellent menu, excellent wine list.  Like Sage, if you're looking for an 'experience', try Johnny's Bar--it's the blue-collar neighborhood brother of Johnny's Downtown.  But there's nothing blue-collar about the food."}
{"text":"Cramped but in a good way.

waitress took the time to explain the menu.

calamari was a bit chewy.

famous for their veal.

not one dud on that menu.

their doggy bag game is off the charts."}
{"text":"Our good friends treated us to dinner at Johnny's, and we had a wonderful evening.  It is definitely an old school kind of place, but I mean this as a complement.  The old bar is well worn, but they make a good drink, and the garden area out back is beautiful and romantic--perfect for a nice summer evening.  I dressed up and wore a coat to dinner, and many did as well, but I was surprised to see several under dressed people being seated.  Sigh..

The snobby, √ºber-trendy, gotta always have something new crowd won't like the menu, but there is something to be said about preparing high quality traditional dishes.  Yes, I had the pounded veal chop, and yes, it was everything it should be!  The stuffed calamari appetizer was delicious--I never had it prepared this way before.  My wife had the seafood pasta, and the seafood was fresh, but best of all, the pasta tasted like homemade.  

Ok, so the prices are high--this is definitely a special occasion place--but the quality and quantity is there to justify it, as is the service.

I can see why this place has survived all these years, while the trendy places are in one day and out the next."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in Cleveland (when I am not paying the bill), though it's worth the splurge. The first time, I wasn't hungry and had a salad (good, but a salad nonetheless), though I tried my brother's salmon special, and it was excellent.  The second time, I knew I had to try an actual entree, so I went for the red snapper special.  The mango curry south had just enough heat coupled with sweetness to accentuate the fish, which despite a crispy shell was soft and flaky inside.  The lentils and asparagus were also cooked and seasoned very well.  However, my brother once again made the pick of the day: a peppercorn duck breast appetizer in a cherry sauce (another special) that was scrumptious and juicy, with the cherries not a sugary dessert glaze but an almost savory sauce to bring out the richness of the meat.  My mom always goes for the peppercorn filet, which is one of the house specialties that never fails to disappoint her.  Additionally, both times we've had exceptional service, and quick seating because it's a bit off the beaten path."}
{"text":"One of tHe most amazing restaurant in all of Cleveland. A must try upscale hideaway that has the best food with great service. I travel for work and I have found no better in any city."}
{"text":"This review is so difficult for me to write since I went there on my anniversary and I don't want to make it sound like it wasn't an awesome experience. 

It was romantic, fancy, delicious, definitely memorable. If you haven't dined on their whimsical patio, you're surely missing out. We made reservations a day or two in advance and when we arrived, we asked to be seated on the patio. It was no problem and we were taken to a private table, which was really thoughtful. The scenery was beautiful and the only other guests was a large party under the awning. 

The service was awesome. Our waiter looked like he'd been working there for quite some time and his knowledge of the menu was spot on. He took note that this was not only our first visit, but it was also our anniversary and made us feel really, really special. He added all the unique, fancy touches we needed to feel like we were having a proper night-on-the-town.

The menu was packed with items, all with pretty hefty price tags. I'd say unless you wanted just plain pasta with marinara, expect to spend over $30 or way more on any entree--meatless or not. For this price I expected the food to blow me away--and don't get me wrong, it was delicious. The taste just did not match the price. In fact, I left feeling confused on how we spent about $200 on two pasta dinners, 2 appetizers and a couple drinks. 

I'm certainly the kind of gal who believes, \"you get what you pay for\" and doesn't mind splurging on a great meal out for a special occasion. But when you leave a restaurant feeling like you could have had a better, fresher meal for less coin--it's sort of disappointing. 

The stuffed peppers were delicious, no complaints there. The caprese salad was just not great. The tomatoes were super-cold, a big sign that they were pre-cut and refrigerated. The mozzarella was chewy and also not fresh, but the worst part of the salad was the balsamic glaze. It was TOO sweet, almost like a balsamic caramel that overpowered what was supposed to be the delicious taste of fresh tomatoes and mozzarella. We both ordered different kinds of seafood pastas for our main courses and although my man scarfed his down, I had a hard time making a dent in my dish. It was good, but some of the shrimp and scallops were viciously over-cooked and chewy. But, I will say the pasta tasted freshly made and the tomato di olio sauce was tasty--just not over $30 tasty. Most of what I saw on the menu appeared to be too heavy and not focused on showcasing the fresh, beautiful and SIMPLE tastes of Italian cuisine and fresh ingredients.

I truly believe in this business and wish nothing but the best for them, but they really need to think about updating certain aspects. The prices wouldn't be so bad if the food was fresher and/or locally sourced. But it is not. The menu is stuck in 1970 and desperately needs a modern face-lift. Keep the items that work, but update what doesn't for the love of our wallets. There is no way they're pulling in the same profit that they were years ago and I guarantee that's why the prices have inflated to these horrendous levels. 

I would definitely return to Johnny's and probably stick with their traditional spaghetti, but I'd skip the other things which bump the price tag up x100. The atmosphere inside and out are totally unique to this Cleveland institution--an experience not to be missed."}
{"text":"Amazing food every time I eat here. Great menu, lots of choices. Pasta and meat dishes are very good. They always have a nice selection of specials. Salads are included with the meals... not a la carte.  Love the small feel dining room with white linen table clothes, but the patio is also very nice on the warmer months.  Very attentive staff. 
Parking available on the street in the neighborhood or valet."}
{"text":"Great old place that's famous in Cleveland. Ok, the neighborhood's a little sketchy, but there's free valet parking and the experience is worth it. First, this place has old-school, urban ambience. Not the fake pubby decor that lots of suburban places try to achieve. Everything-the exterior, the people, the fantastic dining rooms, the enclosed courtyard is genuine cool. By the way, you can light up a cigar in the courtyard and instead of dirty looks, the staff brings you  light and an ashtray. The food is very very good. Try the stuffed pepper appetizer-amazing. I've never had calamari served the way they do at Johnny's - A large squid \"tube\" filled with a delicious cheese filling. Don't order it if you're looking for battered fried tidbits with cocktail sauce. Try any of the veal chop dishes-the one with te sun-dried tomato sauce topping was absolutely delicious. My only complaint was it took a little long to get our entree. Everything else came up fast. Maybe the staff was thin on a Tuseday night."}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience we had - I took my family for dinner last Monday (first night of the RNC Convention) and was looking forward to a wonderful meal. However, what we got was

 a snarky waiter, mediocre & overpriced food.  It seemed like many of the prices listed in the special came out to be WAY overpriced and I now understand why - a day after our dinner, it was heard from a reliable source (waiter in downtown venue) that the restaurant was jacking up prices to take advantage of out of town guest coming for the convention.  For locals that dine out often, this was a deplorable realization - I guess that is why there was a very long list of \"specials\" that the waiter was pushing, so he could charge at will for specific items.  I believe this to be true since we were presented at the end of the meal with a handwritten check - really?!!! 

As for the snarky waiter - when your meal is advertised to have spinach and it comes with a couple of measly pieces, your answer when questioned should not be \"Oh, it is meant to be like a herb\" or when one questions why the egg parpadelle is stuck together in 5-6 layers, your response should not be \"because it's homemade\".

Overall, very disappointed that a restaurant with this reputation would stoop to make a profit at the expense of loyal diners who will not likely return."}
{"text":"Dine in a time warp-crowded, noisy and expensive.  The food is good, but may not be worth the prices charged.  Servers are apparently instructed to get the check as high as possible.  I neglected to specify the brand of the wine ordered and the server brought the most expensive-shame on me.  One of our party ordered a vegetable substitute for a side dish and received a large \"up charge,\"without being advised.-shame on them.\"  It was removed after a complaint, but left us with a bad feeling.  It will be a long time before we return-if ever and we plan to let our friends know about our experience.  Johnny's:  Do you really need the extra money by gouging?"}
{"text":"This place has consistently prepared some of my favorite meals of all time.
My current favorite meal is the filet au poivre, cooked Pittsburgh medium rare.

The service is the best"}
{"text":"This place is not what it used to be. We walked in and weren't greeted by anyone. Eventually an older man dressed in some worn out looking casual clothes waved us over to him from the end of the bar and asked if we were \"on the books\". My husband told him that we did have reservations.

Our server was a delight - personable and attentive. The bread was incredibly underwhelming -  room temperature and lacked flavor. My husband got the house salad, which was divine. My ceasar salad was warm and bland. We ordered frog legs to start, which were cooked perfectly and the sauce that came on them was full of flavor. My husband ordered the long-bone lamb with shiitake mushrooms, and sundried tomatoes - everything had great flavor but the lamb was disturbingly under cooked. My husband ate it anyway, because he was hungry (he paid for it later). I ordered the rib eye with roasted potatoes. The potatoes were room temperature and dried out, they weren't edible at all. My rib eye tasted great, but several bites in, I realized that it was also barely cooked and couldn't eat it. At that point, we both realized that the server never asked us how we wanted our meat prepared. This is kind of odd, I get that steak connoisseurs will tell you that the best way to order a steak is rare to medium rare, but more importantly that is individual preference. I wanted to, but couldn't manage to finish the steak. The last piece I took was so under cooked that I ended up having to spit it out, the texture of raw beef is pretty gross and I'd lost my appetite altogether. The server was again quite accommodating and offered to take it back to have it cooked more (or in general) or have a new one prepared. At this point, my husband was almost done eating and I was feeling sick to my stomach so I declined and opted for the option of having the meal removed from the bill. 

My husband and I both ended up getting sick. He was much worse than I was so I'm glad I didn't finish my steak, but we both spent the better part of the rest of the night in the bathroom.

A poor quality sound system was pumping out 80's pop music while a rather large and very loud guest in the dining area was getting ripped drunk and made sure everyone in the restaurant knew about it. If you've never been to Johnnys, it is a very small place. 

A high-end, cozy and intimate establishment, with soft music playing in the back ground and mouth watering food that is worth every penny is what Johnnys Bar is supposed to and used to be. If you want to get your money's worth out of a meal, particularly a good steak, and an atmosphere that reflects it's prices, I'd highly recommended not going here."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit to Johnny's staff was great my food was great can't say enough went there with my family for cocktails and a birthday dinner highly recommend"}
{"text":"I rarely leave reviews on here as most reviewers usually say similar things and if there's a consensus opinion about a place there's probably some merit to that opinion. However, last night, I had a bad experience at Johnny's Bar and thought it was worth a Yelp review. We had an 8 PM reservation for 4 people and weren't seated till close to 8:45. Look, I get that stuff happens and sometimes people don't get up from a table and there's not much a restaurant can do. But a 45 minute wait in the most overcrowded and loud restaurant in Cleveland was really annoying. The only area for us to stand was where waiters and waitresses were running food and we had to keep moving around. Also, if it was just the 45 minute wait, that sucks, but the hostess and managers were rude and basically ignored us whenever we asked if our table was almost ready. When we finally got seated, the waiter we had was good, the appetizers really good and the entrees just meh. (Stuffed peppers and fried mozzarella were good, my pappardelle was awful - the noodles were all stuck together like a casserole or something). But they never came over and apologized for the wait or gave us anything complimentary or anything like that. No dessert, drink or appetizer. I know this place is always slammed on the weekends so they probably don't have to treat customers very well and it will still be crowded but I know I'll never come back here after the inconsiderate way we were treated last night."}
{"text":"This places is an \"Old School\" steakhouse kinda joint, complete with very formal waitstaff. There's not much on the menu less than $35/plate. Several people at our table ordered red meat. No steak knives were given to us. My friend pulled a knife out of his pocket to cut his dinner! The waitress never even noticed.

I had a peppered duck breast appetizer- 5 or so slices of duck on a plate, (again with no proper knife) for $16. I've had way better duck. I tasted several steaks at the table, and they weren't that spectacular, not any better than a Longhorn steak.  My water glass was frequently empty - a pet peeve of mine.

For a great expensive steak, I'd rather go to XO Prime. For killer good service, Mallorca treats customers like kings and queens. I won't be back to Johnny's Bar."}
{"text":"Order the linguine with scampi if you love garlic, which I do. The other dish that never disappoints is the Veal Scallopini."}
{"text":"went for an early mid week dinner. Food and service were great. Authentic Italian food. Will be back again."}
{"text":"It has been a couple of years since I visited Johnny's Bar on Fulton, but to be honest, it is one of my favorite and most memorable meals EVER so I can easily write about it now.  I was a little scared when we told our cab driver where we wanted to go, and he said, and I quote, \"are you SURE you want to go THERE?\"  I guess it's not the greatest neighborhood.

This is a great special occasion place, because it is NOT CHEAP.  We started with great wine and the veal stuffed hot banana peppers with homemade marinara.  Oh. My. God.  If these were an entree I would order a platter of them.  We had the long bone veal chop, sea bass, grouper, and another veal entree as the main course, and each was better than the last.  I just reread the menu and want to go back, cold-smoked filet mignon, or filet wrapped in puff pastry with a chardonnay cream sauce. I'm sure we had after dinner drinks and desserts, but those I cannot recall.  

The atmosphere of this place is awesome.  Leopard print carpet!  The service was good."}
{"text":"My wife & I tried Johnny's for the first time tonight and we left satisfied and impressed. I had the Italian Feast & my wife had the Veal Scallopini snd they were both delicious! Waitress was pleasant & attentive and the same can be said for Bo, the owner. Look forward to returning when the weather's nicer to take in the patio."}
{"text":"Dine in a time warp-crowded,noisy and expensive. The food is good, but may not be worth the prices charged. Servers appear to be encouraged to get the checks as high as possible. I neglected to specify the brand of the wine selected, so I received the most expensive one-shame on me. One of our party ordered a vegetable substitute for an included one and received a substantial \"up charge\" without being advised-shame on them. It was removed after we complained, but left us with a bad feeling. It will be a long time, if ever, we return 
and plan to share our experience with friends. Johnny's: Do you really need the extra money by gouging?"}
{"text":"i'll keep it brief........good, but not great.  very tight, we spent the whole evening getting bumped by the waiters. our waiter was SLOW, friendly, but took forever for everything. just trying to get our check was like pulling teeth!!!
food- ok, the soft shell crabs appetizer ws delicious but my filet and lobster wrapped in puff pastry was unspectacular. the meat was very well done, the lobster was like mush, over cooked mush. the green beans cold, so were the potatoes. the only thing great on the whole plate was a little cheese custard \"dot\". i saved it for my last bite. the homemade steak sauce on the bone-in ribeye special was delicious. we skipped dessert, saw what people around us were eating, seemed unimpressive. so, keep in mind.....it's tight, food is hit or miss, so is the service and it is on the pricey side......which wouldn't be a bad thing if what you were getting was actually good. haven't been here in about 20 years, i always forget about it......it will be, probably, 20 more years before i'd return.
seems to be a kind of a professional men's hang-out  (lots of suits talking business & golf)  ........."}
{"text":"Best Cleveland restuarant. The food from apps to desert was perfect. I order the bone in veal chop it was the best i ever had. 

Our waiter Ricky made the night extra special. We had the best service ever. If you go there ask for him. He hits a grand slam with his service.
.
Order the Banana Fosters for desert is great finish to a perfect night

Only draw back is that it is a bit pricy but worth it."}
{"text":"Time for a leisurely dinner? No rush and terrific food! We flew in from DC and next to Filomenas in Georgetown Johnnys rocks!"}
{"text":"Great place. The atmosphere is fantastic.
The food was great. I had a veal dish that was perfectly prepared. The price is very fair when you consider that you get a nice size salad with your dinner, as well as a vegetable and starch.

Love the bar too!"}
{"text":"Valet parking is a huge thing around there and free is a bonus!

Upon entry, there should be someone in the entrance to great you! If this is a \"high end\" dining place that would be one thing to seek out!

Seated early, another perk! Greeted by our server immediately! 5 stars!
 
I feel that upon saying the specials, include the pricing! The price for THREE stuffed calamari is WAY elaborate! 

The bread was amazing! Dinner salad, amazing! Entree, Linguini with clams and scallopini was 3 out of 5 stars! Very dry! Waiter knew something was off because I hardly touched it! To go box, no thanks! If you pay that amount of money it should not be bland with a ton of oil! Shrimp was good and huge! Far too many clams! 

The filet was to die for that my partner ordered! 

The tab, to the extreme! And I have been here several times past! Maybe it was an off evening?!"}
{"text":"We had an incredible time. The food and atmosphere was so good. Linda, our waitress, was the best. Thank you Linda!"}
{"text":"As you pull up to Johnny's Bar, it takes a bit of courage to get out of your car.  The neighborhood clearly has had better days, however faint elements of its previous life as an Italian-American part of town remain.  Parking is short in supply, however there is a complimentary valet at the front door who will not only park your car, but keep an eye on it for you.

Once you open the door and venture in, it's like taking a step back in time to a 1950's Italian steakhouse.  The space is relatively small, however, there is a large bar area with plenty of seating.  The decor is vintage stained wood panelling with a nice decorative ceiling.  Seating is tight, but this adds to the ambience; this type of restaurant was built when dining out was a social experience.  There is a buzz of activity as the servers navigate the tight aisles with wonderful appetizers, entrees, desserts, and drinks.

First, we'll discuss the wine list:  it has a nice selection of reasonably price glasses and bottles.  My wife had a nice cab for $12.50 and I had a solid Pinot Noir for $8.50.  Most places would charge $15 or more for these offerings.

The menu had a nice variety of seafood, veal, steak, and pasta options.  The appetizer that caught my eye was the banana peppers stuffed with veal, although we didn't get it since we had expected a lot of food with our entrees.  The most prominent item was the long bone veal chop, a dish that they are famous for.  We saw several of these come out of the kitchen, sizzling and smelling fantastic!  They also had a 16 oz New York strip steak covered with grilled onions and a demi-glac√© which seemed to be extremely popular.

The dinner came with a nice side of bread, which had a nice cracked pepper crust, and a mixed green salad.  The salad dressing options were typical of an Italian restaurant, although I'll say that the balsamic that I had was the best I've ever had.

My wife ordered a unique dish, a beef tenderloin medallion, enclosed in a puff pastry with some lobster baked in for good measure.  It was delicately covered with a light cream sauce and  as cooked to perfection.  It was completed with a side of scalloped potatoes and some freshly picked green beans.  My wife can be quite demanding culinarily sometimes, however, in this case she was extremely satisfied.

I ordered a more traditional veal scallopine and shrimp with a marinara sauce and linguine.  The veal and shrimp were cooked to perfection, the saucy was fresh and zesty, and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  

We wrapped it up with a huge piece of chocolate mousse cake and espresso.  

Total bill $112 for two glasses of wine, two entrees, a dessert, and espresso.  Not the cheapest meal in town, but considering the unique atmosphere, fresh and delicious food, and impeccable service, it was well worth the price.

I would recommend Johnny's Bar to anyone looking for a nice romantic dinner, celebrating a special occasion, or simply looking for a very good northern Italian meal.

They also have a very nice hidden patio area known as Louisa's Garden, which looked like a great spot to enjoy dinner and a glass of wine under the stars."}
{"text":"Talk about your serendipitous discovery - Johnny's Bar is DIVINE.

I know what you're thinking.  \"A place called Johnny's Bar?  Divine?!\"  From the outside, the simple brick facade and neon signage imply your average, run-of-the-mill hideaway where you can go to pound back a few beers with your buddies.

Well, that's what my friend Kate and I thought, when we decided to grab a drink and maybe some food before going to see a show at Near West Theatre.  One of her student's recommended it because his father worked there, so we headed over.

We should have been tipped off by the valet service, but the surprise didn't really hit until we walked in.  The atmosphere inside is warm and inviting, with lots of muted, glowing lighting and dark woods.  We immediately knew we were in for more than we had bargained for, in a good way.

Johnny's isn't large, but there are a few choices in seating: you can sit at the bar, right inside the front door, up on a raised level past the bar, or in another, larger dining room with beautiful murals painted on the walls (which I actually didn't discover until the second time I went there).  Kate and I sat up on the intimate, raised level at a little two-top.

We sat down and took in the linens and the flowers and the heady romance of the room and decided that, apparently, we were on a date.

After putting on our best grown-up faces, we perused the menu and made some amazing selections.  With more cash, we certainly would have ordered more, but even the smaller meals we got were amazing.  The spaghetti and meatballs, as simple as it sounds, were delectable, and I had a warm salad with cranberries and walnuts and some amazing concoction drizzled on top... MMM.  Even the bread was fantastic - warm and fresh, and the waiter came after we'd finished to brush crumbs from the table with the little crumb-brusher thingy.

Yep, it's that kind of place.  They have crumb-brusher thingies.

We hadn't planned on spending what we spent, but it was DEFINITELY worth it.

So if you want some AMAZING food in a classy place, head on over - the meal and the experience are worth the price.  And though they didn't turn us away in our jeans and sweaters, have fun and get yourself saucy for this one!"}
{"text":"New Year's Eve at Johnny's Fulton was an elegant way to welcome in 2016!  Bo and his family along with all the stellar staff made you feel like you traveled to NY to celebrate. A fantastic jazz trio along with their iconic dishes like their cherry walnut glazed duck appetizer and my long-bone veal chop with smoked Gouda made it a remarkable night! However big that wine cellar is, Bo and Ricky always have a knockout pairing for you at any level. Simple details such as the best damn cappuccino I've ever had with dessert completed an exceptional experience. Thank you so much. Buon Anno!"}
{"text":"After receiving a gift card to this establishment I decided to give it a shot...and I'm very glad that I did.

Their food is AMAZING. They have plenty of unique dishes alongside the Italian classics. 

The place is very quaint which is pretty much fitting for this romantic-esce establishmnet. A great location if you're looking to really impress your date. The prices are pretty high. Two people who don't drink will AT LEAST run a tab of $100. They have live music on some days too. Honestly my 2nd favorite restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Johnny's patio was included in the Plain Dealer's \"Best Restaurant Patios\" article, so we decided to check it out on a Friday night.  The restaurant was jammed and noisy but the patio was cool, quiet and very classy.  We had a great dinner in a romantic outdoor setting."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path, but that's why I chose it.  It's reputation as a Cleveland landmark was not lost on me. The unassuming neon \"BAR\" sign outside and classy but unpretentious interior as well as the somewhat gruff but eminently friendly staff are also hallmarks of a good find from the likes of a NYC area foodie.  Apps were perfectly done (surprised to find frog legs outside Chinatown or a bistro).  If you like veal, this is the place for you. Chevre stuffed veal chop with 3 types of mushrooms and a port wine reduction were delicate and perfect.  Plus, the cab we took from the Renaissance Hotel rolled up just as we paid the check. How could I complain?"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite restaurant. I can't begin to describe why this is my favorite restaurant. The food is the best I have ever had from beginning to end. The sausage stuffed pepper appetizer was delicious. It was a great way to begin the meal. The salad had a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Just talking about it makes me crave it. It is one of the best balsamic vinaigrette dressings that I have ever had. For the entr√©e I chose one of their featured dishes...a ribeye with a homemade sauce. The steak was perfectly prepared and the sauce was deliciously sweet and tangy. Surprisingly though, the food was not the best part of the experience for me. The best part of the dining experience was the waiter. He made the dining experience complete. Because of this, we always dine here for special occasions and to make lasting memories."}
{"text":"Unique decor. Fan favorite. Parking is a challenge."}
{"text":"Johnny's Bar on Fulton, while not a very big place, is charming. Unfortunately the gorgeous patio (read: garden) was full, so we sat indoors in a slightly cramped dining room. But that only added to the atmosphere. There was valet, but also parking on the side street not too far of a walk away. 

The server was friendly and attentive. I asked the server her preference between the on-menu walleye and the halibut special of the evening. The server recommended the halibut and I was not disappointed. 

The entree came with a house salad which was simple and small, but a good starter. The halibut was a good portion size. It came with rice and thin stalked asparagus. It was a flavorful and light option for dinner. 

I definitely want to come back and try a true Italian dish...or maybe a steak - I saw one going out and it looked delicious!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed and honestly, I came in just because we drove by and the sign looked appealing.  

I'd already eaten so I can't comment on the food but the menu looked absolutely amazing!  

What I can comment on is the atmosphere, the people and the sheer surprise of this place!  I thought Johnny's Downtown was the only Johnny's only to find out that Johnny's Bar started in 1920 as the first bar after Prohibition to get a liquor license.  Downtown and Little Bar were later editions as was the menu which turned \"high end\" in the 90's.  

We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender who was very nice, chatty and helped us pick between some of the high end Whiskey's available behind the counter.  The owner (nephew to the original Johnny) was also there and you could tell that everyone took great care in making their customers happy.

I'll surely go back to try to food sometime!  A real diamond in the rough!  

(They also have two private rooms, one for 12 people and one for 30 which are often rented out by celebrities or...umm...people who make more money than lil' ol' me!)"}
