{"text":"It is about time to give some love to Lorain county as I call it my home. More and More there are some fine places to eat coming close to home. 

Found this place two Fridays ago but just now getting around to do the review. We went as my sister in law knows the owner and does some charity cooking work with them for underprivileged kids. Big props for giving back. 

The place is located in Amherst which has some cool little places I am starting to find...reviews when I go the next time....Parking was easy and although we had no reservation we never hesitate to eat at the bar instead of waiting the 10 minutes we were told for a table. 

Found 4 seats at the bar and were greeted quickly by the bartender who made a great version of my brothers favorite drink the Moscow Mule (our favorite is at velvet tango room) They also had Newton Claret by the glass which at 13 was pricey but well worth the taste. The bar staff allowed my wife to sample any wine before she bought a glass which is always appreciated. The pours were generous and the bartenders had no problem engaging us with great conversation. The moon mountain cabs were also featured and very tastee. 

I ordered the pinot braised pork belly which was perfectly done. My brother and his wife always share as do me and my wife so I can say my sister in laws pan seared chicken was excellent and my brother had the special fish called amberjack which was excellent as well. My wife felt the need for a 20 ounce rib eye. I have spoiled her with this dish and she is almost always disappointed as I make it perfectly at home. Corks version was average as the cut could have been better marbeled and lacked tenderness and seasoning. We took the leftovers home for the kids. Everything else was wondrful. I recommend this place for all far west side rs to try."}
{"text":"Just went there Friday night. Worst dinning experience we have ever had! My girlfriend found a small worm (insect) in her vegetables!!!!!! The waiter and the manager could have cared less!!!! Needless to say we will never go back again! BEWARE!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Chef John is the man. Go Dave and Paul!!"}
{"text":"Corks is such a beautiful place to have dinner.  What Paul has done to remodel has been outstanding.  My favorite item on the menu is the Mac n cheese.  

My only complaint is that the food always seems a bit salty for my taste.  Having high BP, that is a big no no for me.  So we can't eat here as often as I would like.

That being said, it's great place for a glass of wine or trying new craft beers and simply enjoying the atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is good here. The above negative review by Tamara Z. should be considered lightly. I've eaten here 4 times and it was always good.

Now the 4 stars come almost entirely from the beer selection.

Great Divide, Stone Brewery, Breckenridge... yes please! 
So many great beers compared to most of the bars in Amherst."}
{"text":"The meat was undercooked and the sauce was over spiced. I told my waitress after 1 bite it was not to my liking. The chef and manager decided to box it up and told the waitress to tell me since it was a \"gamble\" wether or not I would like it that I should take it and made me pay for it... This is the 4th time I tried Corks and Stubby's and EVERY time the meal has been anything but satisfying... Try the Jackalope for a fine dining experience or go down the street to Ziggys if you want a good meal and an understanding staff on how a dining experience should be... Diso's Bistro in Lorain is a good choice over this dismal establishment ..."}
{"text":"Not from the area and stopped for a quick lunch while out for work. Great food and atmosphere! Very quick and friendly service. Got a mushroom and Swiss burger and tater tots. My co-worker got a Reuben and maple fries... Which were sweet potato fries with lots of sugar and maple. No complaints! Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"We come here at least twice a month. Always great service and great drink specials. The steak Philly and seafood linguine are my faves!"}
{"text":"My mother and I hosted an bridal shower at Cork's Wine Bar and it was a terrible experience. After multiple changes with the event planner (clearly Cork's was having a staffing issue) we had to reach out to Cork's and confirm all of the details multiple times.  

When we arrived at the restaurant no one was there to let us in. Eventually a janitor who was not expecting us opened the door and we discovered that nothing was set up as promised. We had 1 hour to set up and lots to do. The tables were dirty, we had to clean off clutter from the bar, and the windows and front door had finger prints- nothing had been done from the night before. My mom and I were in heels and were scrubbing the tables, cleaning windows, and rearranging tables and chairs, and were putting linens on the tables. When our server arrived, he was apologetic and tried to assist us as best he could. We were overwhelmed with the amount of work that needed to be done, even though the Cork's event planner had reassured us that this would all be taken care of for us and all we would need to do is place our centerpieces on the tables and be done.  

Half way through the meal, the future bride came up to my mother and told her that the food bins were empty (we had a buffet). We had to tell the staff to fill up the food, since we ordered more than enough for everyone. When we had time to reflect on the event, we also noticed that the bread we had ordered was missing. My mother was very embarrassed since she has worked so hard to plan this meal. Guests were commenting that we had run out of food but actually it just needed to be refilled from the kitchen. 

We asked to speak to the owner or the event planner so we could voice our concerns and discovered that the event planner was out of town and the owner was no where to be found. We later discovered after the event that the owner was there, although he did not identify himself at any point. We tried for days to contact the owner following the event and received no response. Eventually he did contact my mother but with little resolution. We were made to feel like our wedding shower was not important to the event planner or the owner of Cork's. It was a very special day in the life of my sister and unfortunately my mother and I were so overwhelmed with this experience we could not enjoy ourselves. 

Cork's Wine Bar & Bistro was a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Service was terrible!  Menu changed and food wasn't great.  Our waitress was snooty.  Now I know why no one was there...."}
{"text":"I had real high expectations during my second visit.  Ordered the ELK burger .. came with a long blond hair embedded in my burger (EEEK!).  Wait staff was apologetic and I was told [and I quote] \"The Owner will take care of this - We are so sorry\".  I got a replacement burger.  No one took care of anything.  I was charged fill price for the burger and I guess the hair.  It will be my last visit!!!"}
{"text":"Had Stubby's one night for dinner NEVER AGAIN!!! My soup was stone cold and my mom's was like licking a salt lick ...oh and her's was cold as well. When the food finally came out I got the buttermilk chicken and lets just say KFC has better chicken. It tasted like it was cooked in burnt oil and it was dry, my mashed red skin potato's where still raw...but the ones that are cooked where stone cold :-( The gravy was out of the can!!!! 
Next my mom got the burger there...we where told that it was taking so long because of the burger. When that came out it was some thin high school special GFS brand burger on a cheap bun. Really now if you are told the burger is what is taking so long wouldn't you think it's going to be a big juicy yummy goodness of a burger?Nope just the frozen GFS high school special :-(
Not one time did management come over to check on us since we told our server how bad the food was...he did however quip that maybe we should write down everything that was wrong since we seemed not to like anything :-/ 
On a bright note...they have a great Micro brew beer selection...so I will go there for the beers since they are the only place within a 10 mile radius that has some great beers without having to go to the next closest place which is Rocky River to have my favorite beer. :-)"}
{"text":"This is a review for the Stubby's portion, not Corks. 

Upon arrival, we were greeted by a nice, friendly young lady who promptly seated us. The booth we sat in was the last one towards the back of the building. The entire area back there had a terrible smell, almost smelled like urine. Our server came over to the table in a reasonable time and took our drink orders. Then we waited, and waited, for almost 10 minutes. When our drinks were finally brought to us, our server apologized and even commented on how long they took. Keep in mind, the bar wasn't full, nor was the restaurant. No excuses for those drinks taking that long. We placed an appetizer order (potato bombs) along with our dinner orders. We waited almost 20 minutes for the appetizer to be brought out, only to discover that they were way over cooked and hard as a rock. We sent them back and asked for them to be taken off the check. Shortly after, our dinners arrived. I can't comment on the others, but mine was not good. I ordered the cheese steak sandwich. It was very bland, no seasoning. The meat was definitely over cooked and very rubbery. The only good part of this night was our server. He did a good job. I will not be returning here ever again, unless major things change around there."}
{"text":"Was like an up-scale Ziggy's. Food was about the same. Would not go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant for local comfort food.  Great atmosphere and food is always good.  The menu  has a wide variety and provides from lighter dishes to hearty meals.  The fresh cut chips make for an amazing appetizer."}
{"text":"i must say i was skeptical  at first however the sandwich I ate was excellent. i recommend sitting outside amidst the douche bags going by revving their motorcycle  exhaust pipes. YOU FOLKS, ARE DOUCHE BAGS."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Saturday night and I'll have to say I like this place! The Stubby side is more like a neighborhood bar and was pretty busy and loud, the Corks side was more upscale looking (they had little slices of cucumber in the water!) and quiet. We went with the Corks side since it was not busy and seemed like a more intimate space great for conversing with your date. Our waiter was friendly, attentive, and informative, giving some great suggestions for what to eat, and it was interesting to learn he had grown up in New Zealand. 

For the food we started with the Reuben Egg Rolls. Nothing spectacular, but they were good. Probably would have been a better presentation if they had cut the two rolls in half at an angle on a plate instead of serving two thick rolls in one of those Asian carryout containers that then get thrown away. On a higher note, I was really happy with the Elk Burger and rosemary fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and everything tasted great! My dining companion got this chicken dish in a lemon sauce with a heaping mound of mashed potatoes. They seemed to really like their dish as well. 

We shut the place down since we were there for four hours and were the last customers to leave, (they had to unlock the door for us to get out), but all of the staff were friendly and had no qualms about us enjoying our time there while they cleaned up. Oh and at one point we did move to the Stubby side where they were playing 90's music which I enjoyed trying to remember the lyrics to. Some side notes: you can find parking along the street or I think there is a lot around the corner. Also, be careful when you go to their website because my computer warned me that the site was hacked and a threat to visit the menu, (although that could have just been my computer hinting at me to stop eating out).

Overall I would definitely recommend this place and if I ever happen to be in the area again I would likely stop by to try more of their offerings!"}
{"text":"I'm in town from Miami FL and was just blown away by the bison ribeye and the rosemary goatcheese macaroni! I will def be back!"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to eat but now the service and food are terrible.  Not sure why the owner has lost interest but clearly he has lost touch.  With 2 great places to eat on the same block, this place will be closed in the near future in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place used to be great when Paul owned it. Not the food is below average and the place already seems to be falling apart. It's a true shame that this happened to what could have been a great staple in Downtown Amherst."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and still trying everything.  This restaurant has a gluten free menu which was needed for a visiting relative.  We made reservations for Saturday night which weren't needed, as nobody was there.   My husband and I had the Guinness soup and it was very good.   He had the meatloaf special which was 4 large pieces of meatloaf and a mountain of mashed potatoes.   He thought it was just ok, nothing special.  I had the beef brisket which was served in a bowl on top of mashed potatoes and covered with julienned vegetables.  Great flavor and large portion.  For the gluten free dinner, the filet mignon was good.   I am not certain the red skin potatoes were gluten free as I am sure they were cooked in grease that had other items cooked in it.

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, an extensive beer and wine list and a great menu.    Service was very good and food was good.   Can't figure out why nobody was there.   We will be back."}

Mary S. Dallas-


Corks would be best described as a new wine-focused restaurant located in the heart of old historic  downtown Amherst.  Once an occupied Hardware store now took on the life of an upsclae restaruant with an appealing wine list  serving \"pristine product, simply prepared,\" an approach Lorain County has longed for.  

The front patio is featuring two old cast-iron pillars inside from the property's historic residence which were discovered during renovation. Classic Old World bar backed by a wooden frame harbroing wine bottles, tall ceilings, charming lighting fixtures made of vintage wine bottles and a cozy fire place located  in the back.  Strong architectural lines dominate the space, which is comforting, airy and exciting

The entrees were simple and straight forward yet eclectic in presentation.  I was oh so impressed.   The staff synchronized well together like musicians and instruments .....like conductors of fine orchestras.  hands-on with personal attention.   

Crawfish pierogies, Mac and Cheese paired  with Ohio City Pasta!  Hello taste of Cleveland with out the longsum drive back and fourth from Amherst.

Please inform the Chef his pan seared chicken was out of this World, I had a similar dish at the \"Mansion on Turtle Creek\"  a restaruant that George and Laura Bush frequent-  Corks blew them out of the park!  My Gosh those truffle infused grits \"Baby Come Back\""}
{"text":"Tried stubbys today for a late lunch. Our service was v friendly and the food average. They seriously need to spruce up the spuds, the potato chips that come w wraps and sanwiches are beyond boring. Any decent pub needs fresh cut chips (think fatheads). The onion soup was a standout favorite."}
{"text":"We ate dinner at Stubby's for the first time this week - we really like to support local business, but the food here was not impressive and we won't be returning. My vegetables were SWIMMING in oil - I could barely eat them. The salad was mostly toppings with hardly any lettuce. My husband said his burger was decent but I was not impressed with his wimpy looking potato chips. With sandwich prices like that, a better side should be offered. 

The menu is very cheese and meat-driven and there are really zero remotely healthy options for vegetarians or anyone looking to stay relatively healthy while dining out. We were meeting people who had selected this for our dinner plans - this is not a restaurant we would normally eat at, and I was reminded why."}
{"text":"Stopped here on 9/28 for a wedding rehearsal dinner.

Our party had the upstairs dining room to ourselves, which was lovely. I loved the atmosphere of this place. It definitely have the vintage-feel and is very casual and romantic.

Our wedding party chose the chicken marsala with green beans and red potatoes, as well as a beef stir fry and a pasta with their homemade red sauce.

I caught a great glimpse of the downstairs dining area when we walked in; I fell in love with it. Dim lights, chandeliers adorning the bar that were made of glass bottles, and every employee had a shining smile on their face.

I will definitely be back to try the bar-side instead of the private-party side :)"}
{"text":"Stubby's- What a stellar place to have in Downtown Amherst! The food is fantastic, and the atmosphere is less bar-like (think Ziggys) and more of a casual restaurant feel."}
{"text":"This review is for Stubby's, and has nothing to do with Cork's. I come here often, but only to drink. Tonight I made the decision to try the food. Huge disappointment. I ordered the perogies, of which there were three, and they were way too soggy. It's almost as if they were over cooked or that the dough was too thin. Okay, things happen. Let's try a dessert. I ordered the Hampton Cake and my friend ordered the Tiramisu cupcake. Another disappointing experience. The top part of the cake was almost like a thick mousse - which was good. What threw it off, was the dry portion of cake at the very bottom. The textures were completely incompatible. The cupcake was again, dry and the frosting wasn't even good. To put it in my friend's words, it \"wasn't worth the calories\". The beer selection here is great and the servers and bartenders provide awesome service. However, I would suggest not having pre-made desserts. Especially when they come out sub-par for what is expected of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Menu has nice variety and wine list is well priced.  Our server Gina was attentive but not intrusive.  Thank you for a fun evening."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed with corks/stubbys tonight. Website claims that they are open till 1 or 2 am. We showed up at 1045 on a Fri night (7-8-16) and the employees were there drinking and eating but unfortunately for us the kitchen was closed. I have had great food here in the past and will most likely be back, but get your s*t together and update your website to reflect your new Friday hours. As of now a zero star for customer service and a four star for food so that is a 2 star total."}
