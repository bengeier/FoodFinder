{"text":"We ordered beef pan fried dumpling, their special northern style noodles and lamb skewers.   Northern style is bland even tho it looks spicy and have one hot pepper sign on it. Very bland and not enough sauce for sure.   Lamb skewers is nice. Not a lot spices but tastes pretty nice.   Pan fried beef dumpling is a disappointment. We really wanna try their dumplings after so many good reviews on it. But my dumplings looked greasy, small and left a bad taste in the mouth after. Maybe I shouldn't order it pan fried.   Restaurant is normal small Chinese restaurant style."}
{"text":"I visited this place a number of times over the past year, mostly because I like a couple of dishes.  Today when my wife and I went there for lunch, the service was terrible. The waitress and the lady behind the counter were not helpful when we pretty much finished eating 3 out of the 4 dishes we ordered and still waiting for my wife's beef noodle soap.  When it finally came, I gestured to the waitress to place the bowl in front of my wife, but she just ignored that and walked away. The beef noodle soap was filled with pieces of fatty beef.  At the end due to the long wait, too much fatty beef in soap, and their general nonchalant attitude, I decided not to give them any tip. The bill was $27 and I paid $30 expecting change. When I told the waitress I don't want to tip her, she smirked and told the lady behind the counter, then I heard the lady saying in Mandarin don't give any change back to us!   Fortunately for her, she did give the change or otherwise I would have made a scene. I don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"The real reason to go is for dumplings.  You can actually see them making the dumplings for you.  The dumplings are generally above average and the only reason I don't give a five star is because the owners are a little stingy on the filling.  We have tried several varieties and have never been disappointed.  As for the entrees, we have not liked most of the ones we tried.  They are below the quality we can get elsewhere.  We did like the fried Shanghai new year's cake.  The description in the other review of the service being cold but efficient is accurate.  The place is very clean.  We have returned many times and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Great dumplings. Handmade fresh. The noodles are handmade too. I was there at 3pm and only one other table was occupied.  The prices are reasonable.  A jem of a place."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! I have been here multiple times, and is my go-to for dumplings. It's in a busy plaza near Pacific Mall, and this place always have a steady stream of people. The restaurant is really casual. The service is like most Chinese restaurants, decently friendly, but extremely fast and efficient.   FOOD: - lamb skewers (it's a must!) - hot and sour soup - pepper shrimp  - pork and leek dumplings - pork and cabbages - lamb dumplings - pan fried pork and leek dumplings (so crispy and delicious!)  They also have mini hot pots, and the one with the meat balls, as well as the one with the chicken is good. Great way to warm you up!  I only had one item that I haven't liked, and it was the chicken with the sweet and sour sauce. The sauce was good, but the chicken was so tough."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in all of Toronto for good Shanghainese food. I come back here every few months and I have a few go-to dishes: - steamed pork and fennel dumplings - fried tofu - white pork with garlic sauce - pickled cabbage soup - xiao long bao - green onion pancakes - fried eggplant Honestly this place is awesome. Come here. It's affordable and so, so, yummy. It can get pretty busy in this plaza during dinner time (especially on the weekends) so come early!"}
{"text":"We came here on a recommendation via email from Yelp.  We arrived at a slow time, they weren't very busy.  Be prepared to have some patience since English is a challenge for the staff.  Just asking if they accept debit payment took me 2 minutes.  We are still relatively new to Northern Chinese cuisine.  So kinda went in without have too many expectations.  After some quick perusing of Google foodie reviews and Yelper reviews.  Apparently the Scallion pancakes are a must have item.  So we ordered the scallion pancakes (aka green onion pancakes, 1 large piece), an order of the chive & egg pancakes (3 pieces), steamed dumplings (pork, shrimp & leeks) arrived in a large steamer with 15 pieces, deep fried prawns with salt & spicy.  We also ordered the #41 shredded pork w/garlic & chili sauce, but it never arrived, I mentioned to the staff they should look on both sides of the order sheet when I went up to the cashier to settle our bill.  Thankfully the missed item didn't arrive, since odds were that would have been take home.  Since there was sooo much dough and pastry with what we ate..I nearly had a food coma from all that dough.  Service : I'd rate this around 2/5 for the the language barrier part and missing our last item that we ordered.  Food : the star of our meal my wife and I agreed upon was the deep fried prawns with salt & spicy (#80).  Runner up would be the scallion (green onion) pancake (#138), chive & egg pancakes (#134) last the steamed pork/shrimp/leek dumplings (#102).    Food comments : the scallion pancake was really heavy but had a lot of fresh scallions (try to eat this quickly as the dough becomes rubbery when it gets cold). Same goes for the chive & egg pancake, (pastry wrap for this was more thin and crispy) and loaded with chives & scrambled egg. The shrimps within the dumplings were not fresh, they were kinda dry, but the dumplings themselves were soup type dumplings (enough soup to fill about 1/2 a chinese soup spoon).  A lot of the available dishes on the menu I had to screen due to me having to manage gout..so no beef dishes, nothing with cabbage, and my wife and I prefer a level of spice between mild and super spicy.  Lamb is considered a red meat, so usually we try to shy away from Lamb, but I wouldn't mind trying their lamb skewers with cumin in the future.  Sadly they didn't seem to have much by means of rice dishes, more on the \"main entree\" type of dishes and small handful of noodle dishes.  Final thoughts : is it worth a repeat visit?  Perhaps yes, for the scallion pancake and the deep fried prawns.  Possibly also to try their Ma Po Tofu dish (hopefully they provide steam rice with this dish)."}
{"text":"The we had the \"3 fresh dumplings\" (it's called that because it has shrimp, pork and chives, the portion is actually 15 dumplings). it was good and juicy.  The xiaolongbao were not very good.... Less juicy than the regular dumplings. The guotie and lamb skewers were very oily.  The place is a little run down, a bit sketch, plastic covers on the tables, etc  Get there before 6pm to avoid the dinner rush. It got quite crowded."}
{"text":"Great place for dumplings and other Chinese dishes.   I recommend getting the mung bean noodles with sesame sauce. However, I like to get the sauce on the side because you can adjust the flavour to your liking. The first time I ordered it with the sauce, I found it too salty.   Steamed dumplings are another must get. They make it right when you order so it is delivered to your table freshly steamed. I like getting the shrimp and veggie dumpling or the beef and radish dumpling.   The braised beef with potato was a bit salty. Although I have to say, the beef was braised very well. It was very tender. There were also a lot of potatoes. Good dish but would prefer it to be a bit lighter on the sauce.  As for the pan fried green onion cake, most of the tables ordered one. It had a lot of green onions inside and the outer layer was crispy while the inside was soft.   The sweet and sour sliced fish was unexpectedly delicious. The outside was fried so it is crispy and covered in a sweet and sour sauce that was tangy which I enjoyed. The fish inside was soft and tender. You could also feel the flaky texture of the fish which was good.  The service is great and the staff are all very quick and friendly. I also like how you order on the menu so you can see what you order!"}
{"text":"Awesome quick service.   For was good and prices were good.  Dumplings are great and the cold dishes are great too."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price! I highly recommend the lamb dumplings, it has a potent lamb taste but still very soupy. Each dumpling gives you a choice of how you want it to be cooked (boiled steamed or panfried), which I enjoy. The service here is friendly, and can communicate well in english which is convinient for me and others. Overall great place for dumplings, woild recommend and will continue to  come here!"}
{"text":"Yes, the decor and service isn't the friendliest, but who cares! The food is really good and really cheap.   Dumplings, kebabs, noodles, entrees.... all good! When I saw the prices, I thought that the portions would be small but they are actually pretty decent.   Minus a star for being cash only/ busy parking lot (hard to drive a bit to find a park)"}
{"text":"Food: 8/10 -- Value: 9/10 -- Service: 7/10 -- Ambiance/DÃ©cor: 6/10  There's nothing groundbreaking about the food here, but it's dependably good.   The \"Meat balls in pot\" were a favourite at our table. The meatballs are soft and break apart easily and the soup is flavourful enough to go well with the meatballs, veggies, and vermicelli. The dish is perfect for a colder day. You'll warm right up. The \"pan fried green onion cake\" was also a favourite because it was piping hot and crispy.   Their fried dumplings (called \"guotie pork\") were good, but a little moist by my standards. I like my pan fried dumplings to be on the crispier side. The regular dumplings (we got a few different types) were all good, with wrapping that is the perfect thickness.  The most unique dish we had was the \"Julienne potatoes wire\". It was a cold appetizer dish of thin strings of potato covered in a lightly sour sauce. It was crisp to the bite, maybe softer than a biting into a raw vegetable, but with not as much give as boiled veggies. It was an interesting texture and taste, but very enjoyable.  Food and service are both quick, which is great. The restaurant's biggest downfall is the atmosphere. It's a little rough around the edges with an exposed ceiling, plastic tablecloths, and dull colours. The exposed ceiling only serves to give some of its loud Mandarin customers' voices more room to echo. While it's not a big deal, sometimes it's a little off-putting to have people yelling while you eat. This is no fault of the restaurant's, but it's something you might expect with the style of food and the good prices."}
{"text":"Food is great, just not what i was expecting from a place that looks so plain and cheap and, plastic sheet table clothes! but the food is good, fresh and tasty. this is definitely a looks can be deceiving place, this isn't just good for a cheap price, it's really good food and i can't believe the cost of it, how do they do this?  better to eat there as a group so you can sample more than one or two dishes as you'll fill up quick, one plate is enough for one person. service is friendly and food is quick, fresh and nice to see everything being made from scratch.  definitely a go to place for a fill up on nice food. definitely need to update the decorum though, it just looks so damn cheap!"}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck!  Came here for lunch on a busy Sunday and lucky there was 1 table available so we didn't have to wait too be seated. The wait for food was another story though.   We ordered the pot-stickers, sour vegetable & pork with vermicelli soup, chive pancake and fried dumplings. The food came out in that order, but the first dish took a good 20 mins to arrive, then each consecutive dish every 5 minutes thereafter.   Food is typical of the northern China cuisine. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-2 Service-3 Food-2 Strikeouts-0/3  This is your typical Chinese place, packed and cleanliness comes into question. The ordering is also simple, they give you a order sheet and you write down how much of each item you want. There's English beside it and a photo menu accompaniment.   Now let's go down to the meat of things!! For a dumpling place, this place sucks, like I can go to a dumpling frozen store, buy their dumplings and steam it at home and it would be better. I'm not a master chef by any means, but ordering like 6 different dumplings that come with 15 dumplings and they all suck says something regardless of being made on site or not. They definitely need a new cook to prepare the steam dumplings. Which place is better for dumplings? Metro plaza at warden and Steele's, but the quality there is only satisfactory, too. All the good places are gone!  Surprisingly, all the non dumpling stuff is good! Tried their chive pancakes and beef pancakes, and DAMN! best I've had in a while. A special delight is tossed mung with clear noodle and sauce. Can't get this dish in many places and taste amazing. beware if you are allergic to peanuts. However good the other dishes were, I did not come for this. I came for dumplings! That's why 2 stars!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner tonight. We arrived at 7.40pm. It was hard going trying to find a parking spot, the whole  car park was full up. When we went into the restaurant there were lots of empty tables.  We got our regular dishes that we normally get at the dumpling place at the New Century plaza. We ordered a large hot & sour soup, minced pork and bean paste noodles, garlic snow pea shoots, pan fried pork dumplings, chive pancakes and steamed dumplings. The food tastes very similar to Chinese Dumpling House but less salty. Overall, the dishes were really good.  As we were eating, more patrons came through the doors and the place was nearly full up, as we were finishing up.  Nice place to go for dumplings.  Prices are really reasonable. The service is ok, need to speak English a bit as they don't speak cantonese. Only bad point is the parking. I think that this will be our go to dumpling house from now on."}
{"text":"Well, what can I say about this place except, freshly prepared dumplings and noodles. I have not seen many places in Toronto where they still freshly prepare dumplings in front of your own eyes. At least I can see who is preparing my plate of dumplings.   The decor is on the downside, perhaps a nice remodel would do the trick. But, the star of the restaurant is the freshly prepared food. I have not had dumplings prepared like they do at New Northern Dumplings for a long time. They stick to the basics and execute their dishes with exquisite finesse. Definitively, try their varieties of dumplings. I would also feast on their noodle dishes because they are absolutely amazing. The noodles are freshly prepared so you know what kind of quality your would expect. Service is decent and the menu prices are very reasonable for the portions that are given.  I would definitely come back and feast on some more dumplings and various Northern Chinese delicacies !"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch with dumplings! Personal favourite is the green onion pancake. Lots of green onions are stuffed into them. But their dumplings are very dry - usually there's some soup or juice in them but this place doesn't make their dumplings and potstickers the same way as other dumpling places. DO NOT TRY THE SHANGHAI BUNS (xiao long bao). They are also super dry and tiny, and are not worth it. Portion sizes are huge despite being a cheaper place (less than $10 per person), so you get what you pay for I guess.  Found a little cockroach crawling from the wall and up to the teapot, so I can't say this is the cleanest establishment out there. Haven't tried their noodles or stir-fried dishes so I can't comment on them."}
{"text":"Went here as directed by previous reviews for dumplings. ..we were not disappointed. Ordered lamb dumplings,  pork & leek, fried lean pork and a onion pancake. The pancake was crispy outside but delightfully soft inside filled with just enough sweet sautÃ©ed green onions. I never tried this before and I enjoyed it very much. The lamb dumplings were my favorite. Sometimes lamb is hard to get right, but it was tender, mild and soup filled! Love at first bite. The pork ones were ok...I think the lamb was so amazing everything else paled. But they still tasted fresh and we're cooked just right. The fried lean pork was not my favorite. My boyfriend seemed to enjoy it more, I had a few bits and was unenthusiastic about it.  We ate so much yet still had lots left to take home...all under $30 to boot! We'll be back again I'm sure of it!"}
{"text":"This is my second favourite place to go for Shanghai food for a decent price.  I used to love the ???, but then I realized that about half a year ago to a year ago, the quality of them got worse because there wasn't any soup in them. However, they still have a wide variety of dumplings at a good price (you're looking at $5-$6 for 15 dumplings or so). When you order, you simply mark it down on a sheet of paper,   One of my favourite and HIGHLY recommended dishes is the Lion ball (A meat ball composed primarily of pork). At a fair price, it is served on the hot pot stoves inside a metal dish with veggies and yam noodles. The soup is delicious! This is a must eat everytime I visit!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for a while, but never got a chance to try it until today.  Came on a Sunday afternoon around 1pm. It was pretty busy, and there was perfectly one table available for us. The decoration is very plain and nothing fancy. Simple chairs, and old school chairs.  The menu is pretty extensive. Huge menu with lots of pictures.  We tried a pork and leek steamed dumplings. The dumplings came steaming hot, not too big in size, but a nice bite size. Becareful when you bite in, the juices might burn or squeeze out! The dumplings cooled down really quickly without the cover, causing the outer wrapping to get hard. Next time I might ask to keep the cover to maintain the heat.  Next we got the braised beef noodles. The noodles were quite chewy and fresh, the beef were soft. Cut into bite size squares, so there was definitely more noodles than beef to go around.  For a cold dish we tried the cucumber jelly fish. The cucumber were finely sliced for more surface area for sauce. The sauce had a nice kick from the garlic, vinegary, but has a sweetness taste after. Was pretty addicting to eat!  Definitely wanna come back and try other dishes available here."}
{"text":"Summary: meh dumplings but amazing appetizers, clean environment, good prices make this a solid option for northern Chinese food  Top Must-Get: beef pancakes (literally \"beef big cookie\") Top Regret: Chinese cabbage and mushroom dumplings  What I'd Get: braised pork on rice, beef pancakes, green onion pancakes. Yes, the only dumpling spot I'd go to and not get dumplings (FUTURE SAM, if you read this, you've repeatedly tried the lamb dumplings here - steamed, pan fried, and boiled - and you don't like it!)   Statutory holidays are sometimes the best days to find new places to explore and eat, since so many of your regular places are closed or packed. And so we found ourselves here on a Monday evening, looking to satisfy some hunger.  It was about half-full when we got there. It's clean and the tables look polished (nice wood finishings), and they've got some Chinese decorations hanging from the ceiling, which is a nice touch - despite that, there is a plain look to the place. We got seated right away, but weren't given the regular menu - they just gave us the order sheet, which has the prices and options on it anyway (see picture). We asked for a menu later, and realized the menu has prices whited out - they just haven't updated it yet!  They have three options for each type of dumpling: pan fried, boiled, and steamed. They're all $6.99 but the fried one comes with 12, the others 15. Some places charge extra for steam, so I do recommend that.  Their selection is different; no seafood options, but they surprised with having pan fried lamb, which isn't super common.  The pan fried lamb wasn't great though. Not particularly crunchy, and while I like the gamey taste, it might be a bit strong for others.   The steamed lamb has really nice skin but they put too much soy sauce (I prefer putting my own). They are wrapped a bit inconsistently, and there was notable size differences of dumplings. This one is a \"soup\" dumpling, with the dumpling containing juices that flavour your tongue when you bite through... but there isn't a ton of soup. They definitely come out hot though, and that's a plus.  The Chinese cabbage mushroom dumplings were okay. No juices in this one, so it was not as flavourful. If you like Chinese cabbage, this might be good... Me, I like mushroom - a sadly, there was a lack of mushroom kick.   SO WHY FOUR STARS?!  The pancakes are heavenly.  Their green onion pancake is STUFFED with green onion. It's fried to a nice crisp and then they PACK it with fresh tasting green onions chopped up and smushed in the middle. Do you like fresh tasting green onions? Because this place got fresh tasting green onions. This dish is offered in a circular style that reminds me of fried dough. YUM.  The beef pancake is tremendous as well - easily the best in the area. Generous amounts of beef on the side with green onion and a sauce, with the pancake itself a triple layered offering that is toasty and crunchy.  I challenge you to order it for takeout, put it in the car, keep the windows up to trap the smell, and NOT eagerly sniff around salivating at the aroma.  This is the real deal. The pancakes boost it from a 3 to a 4 star with ease."}
{"text":"The dumplings are still delicious. I'm not a vegetarian, but I had a different kind of veggie dumpling this time. This one was egg and leek, if I'm not mistaken. They were filling without being as rich as pork dumplings. They also made me feel like I was eating healthy. LOL. The price was also delightful. $4.99 for 15 dumplings. These ones. Some of the pork ones too. That's enough to fill me up for dinner. Cheap eat? Yes.  We had an issue where we ordered a tomato and beef brisket stew, and what came to our table was a pot of something that didn't have much brisket or tomato, but had a lot of vermicelli and assorted vegetables in it. When we addressed the issue with the servers, they said that we were having an issue with the dish because it didn't look like the picture on their menu. That was definitely part of the issue, but the bigger issue was that it didn't match with both the picture and the name of the dish in both Chinese and English. This issue was further complicated by the fact that we don't speak Mandarin and that's the only language any server at this restaurant speaks. They eventually took the dish off the table, but they were definitely unhappy about it.  We ended up getting sweet and sour fish instead of the stew. The fish was tender and flaky. The batter was crisp in a caramelized way (in part because of the lovely sweet and sour sauce on top). The sauce was more sweet than sour, which I liked, and it wasn't a disturbingly artificial shade of red. I would order this again. I believe this was $7.99. The portion was alright. It would have been nice if it had been bigger though.  All in all, a hit and miss experience here. I will be back for the dumplings though. I really like their dumplings."}
{"text":"Cheap reliable place for freshly made dumplings and beef noodle soup.  We always order steamed dumplings.  Love the onion pancake - loads of green onions.  Stir fried noodle for $5.99 is a steal.   Other regular orders include:  beef noodle soup, stir fried rice cakes, lamb skewers and \"fish fragrant sliced pork\" which goes great with rice.  Good quality and usually $1 cheaper in price per dish compared to other dumpling restaurants in Markham and Scarborough."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and I was craving dumplings for a while. I read the reviews on YELP beforehand and most of them were good so we decided to give this restaurant a try. It wasn't busy when we arrived and it's a small restaurant. There's a wide selection of items on their menu and quite extensive. The specialty here is of course dumplings so we ordered the pork and leek steamed dumplings, pan fried pork and shrimp dumplings, Shanghai rice cake and green onion pancake. For the dumplings, pretty good price as you get 12 dumplings for pan fried for $7 and 15 for steamed dumplings at $7. The Pan Fried ones were a bit greasy but still good but my favorite were definitely the steamed ones. The green onion pancake was okay but I've had better and same with the rice cakes. The chef and staff are friendly and nice. I also ordered a bottle of Canadian and it was only $3. Talk about cheap domestic beer!! I definitely love the cheap prices here and it's worth the dumpling craving if you have one. Our total bill for these dishes for 2 people was satisfying at $30. Definitely worth checking this restaurant out if you want dumplings."}
{"text":"This is me and my fiance's go-to place for dumplings. Dumplings can be requested to be made in various ways - pan fried (our fav), steamed or boiled. Their onion pancake is not the flat kind, it's more dough-y and is a must order. Not the fanciest of places and staff speak minimal English but menu is in English and Chinese but the food definitely makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Dumpling Thursdays? perhaps. Along a row of restaurants, and bakeries is another dumpling joint I've stumbled upon. If you want fresh! guaranteed its fresh! they even have a small window area where you can see the employees making the dumplings from SCRATCH!   What makes a perfect dumpling, is that the dough isn't too thick, after all you dont want to be eating 70% and 30% meat lol.  This place made it perfect! We ordered their:  Pork & Leak: $4.99 (15 pieces) perfect size, portion, and the dough wasn't thick, and perfect balance of flavors! 5/5  Pork and Celery: $4.99 (15 pieces)  same as the previous, yum all the way, but not as flavorfully strong as the leek due to its blander taste. 4/5  Pan fried Dumplings: $5-6 (12 pieces) Wow! you can taste freshness, and the oil they used was light.  Perfect slight crisp on the outside, as well size.  Definitely worth it!!! 5/5  Veggie noodles: $5 Cooked well, had all the veggies you need! though I was full, I made some room lol. 4/5"}
{"text":"I like coming here for their big portions of dumplings.   My usual items are steamed dumplings, lamb skewers, green onion pancake, beef pancake.   I like the pork and leek or the pork and pumpkin for the dumplings. I prefer the steamed over pan fried since the fried one is too oily. The steamed ones come out nice and hot and they are huge.   I love their onion pancake. It is filled with a lot of green onions and the pancake is crispy. I also like the pancake with beef.   The lamb skewers are good. I've had better in other areas but they are decent here.   Other dishes such as the noodles and vegetables are mediocre here. I've learned my lesson to just stick with dumplings and pancakes here. It's a solid place to get dumplings but don't expect other items to be that great."}
{"text":"Value is amazing! 6$ for 15 dumplings!!??? I am a huge dumpling fan and their lamb dumpling has that gamey taste lamb lovers really enjoy :)   The pan fried dumplings didn't taste all that much of anything but I like that the skin of the dumplings are not too thick or chewy. They are just the right elasticity you want in a bite.  I got the beef brisket noodle as well. Noodles were chewy but the soup was very very bland and just tastes of salt. I think i wouldn't order anything other than dumplings here.  I would definitely come here for more dumplings. Really satisfies your cravings :)  Beware though that it's all incredibly oily food!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Lamb skewers: Tasty, flavourful and has a little bit of a kick  Sweet and sour fish: Crispy and very flavourful  Pancake: Amazing! Crispy and filled with lots of green onions. So good!  Three kinds of steamed dumplings: It tasted a bit weird and didn't have much flavour. My less favourite dish.   Cucumber jellyfish salad: Very refreshing and the sauce was sweet! YUM!  Fried pork stickers: Long and filled to the brim. Not bad.  Food is cheap and worth it!  CASH OR DEBIT ONLY."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for cheap and filling dumplings. They've got a wide variety of Northern Chinese dishes that aren't spectacular but reasonably priced. This is nice as you can try a lot of different dishes without forking over a lot of money at some of the other places with fear of it not tasting good or being too spicy.  We always get an order of dumplings, the fried noodles with veggies and pork and the green onion pancake.  On this night, we tried a few other dishes as well.  Cold Mung Bean Noodle with Sauce ($6.99) This was a giant portion for the price and came with a lot of different ingredients. The sauce was lacking flavour and tasted a bit diluted. Normally this dish will come with shredded chicken, peanut sauce and the Mung Bean noodles. It would have been amazing if the sauce was better.  SautÃ©ed Lamb with Cumin ($10.99) Typical Northern Chinese flavours that is heavy on cumin and chilies. Not that spicy but very fragrant. Lamb was nice and bouncy with a good amount of fat. A little too much oil was used though as it soaked into the lamb.  Pork and Chive/Dill Dumplings (15 for $6.99) These dumplings are always made to order and have a variety of fillings to choose from. They are always juicy and delicious and a great value. Nothing beats fresh dumplings with wrappers that are freshly rolled.  Green Beans with Minced Pork ($6.99) Needed some veggies so this is a go to item for us. If they aren't too busy, the chef really gets the flavour of the wok into the beans. Today, the restaurant was packed as usual so the beans were a tad over cooked but still tasted quite delicious as they don't skimp on the black beans and minced pork.  Fried Noodles with Vegetables and Pork ($6.99) This dish is similar to a Shanghainese Fried Noodle except they used thinner noodles that are home made. The noodles are super bouncy and they use a tonne of garlic in this dish. Always tasty and great value for the price.  Overall, this place is great for comfort food at reasonable prices. It's nothing fancy and I wouldn't bring a date here, but it's consistent in what you will get and doesn't hurt the wallet."}
{"text":"The food here more than makes up for the lack of ambience. It's a simple local restaurant that makes amazing dumplings and a mean skewer of lamb. The menu is easy to navigate since it has both english and chinese translations. Check off what you want and submit it for some seriously tasty food.   We had the pork and pumpkin dumplings, which was an unexpectedly delicious combination. The pork brought the heavier savoury flavors while the pumpkin lent a sweetness, all in a bite sized package. Get an appetiser of lamb skewers (if you like the gamey taste of lamb) and you have the perfect meal for two people."}
{"text":"Yum! Delicious dumplings.  We tried the chicken and mushroom and the pork and leek (I think it is actually green onion) and both were outstanding.  Nice service, cheap, seems clean, and - unlike a trip to either of the Chinatowns downtown to get dumplings - free parking.  What more can one ask?  The plaza consists primarily of Asian restaurants - need to come back to explore more!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been around for many years and it is a place that I eat at very often. This is the typical dumpling house that you would expect and like many others, this place serves a wide selection of delicious food for a low cost. It is a very plain, simple looking establishment that is usually pretty busy. It is most busy during lunch time on weekends. They keep the place fairly clean and service has always been pretty good.  Highly recommended orders:  Green onion pancake  Pan fried pork & corn dumplings (12 pieces) Steamed chicken & mushroom dumplings (14 pieces) Sweet & sour fish Meatball soup"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favourite places for Shanghai food fix.   Must try is the beef pancake and I think it was only $5.99 - Nice soft and crispy flatbread which can be opened up so that you can stuff it with the thinly sliced beef. A little sweet sauce and some green onions and its like a beef pancake party in your mouth.   The soup dumplings were the only disappointment but they still tasted very good. The soup leaked out on almost all the dumplings :(  The fried dumplings were also done very well. I like the long rectangular shape which makes it easy to stuff in your mouth and love the nice crispy outer layer.  The cold thin sliced beef appetizer was also spot on delicious. Its marinated in this wonderful sauce which I just can't describe and sliced so perfectly thin and the meat is soft and tender.  Finally we also got braised beef noodle soup. Beef was soft and tender. Noodles were nice and thick with a nice chew to it. Done very well once again.  Nothing but praise for this place. Service was fast. And all the 5 items we ordered above only came to about $33 after tax.   Its deserves a 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"the interior leaves much to be desired, but the food matters most at the end of the day, and wow is it good here.  - green onion pancake: on the oily side, but dense in texture and full of green onions.  delicious - lamb skewers: engulfed in cumin, extremely flavourful.  nice and spicy too - steamed pork and fennel dumplings: perfect size, exploding with flavour.  also has some broth inside - wasn't expecting that! - soup dumplings: they're small and actually had less broth than the regular dumplings, but i'm a huge fan of the ginger flavour in the pork.  kinda not recommended - braised pomfret: a little overcooked, but tasty.  the sauce was good, but i uhhh don't remember how it tastes even though i just had it this evening.  i'm so sorry.  yelp please forgive me  very reasonably priced too.  if i'm ever in the area again, i would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I've come to this place on a regular basis. It is one of my favourite places to get hand made steamed dumplings. You can actually see the owners wrapping dumplings by hand and bringing them to cook the way you like (steamed, boiled, pan fried)! I haven't tried much else on the menu because they seem a little oily to me.   Dumplings come in batches of 15 steamed to order so there might be a little wait. As for the price it ranges anywhere from 3.99-6.99 for them depending on which flavours you get. I always get the fennel pork dumplings, they taste amazing and fresh. The skin is thin and light with lots of filling. Careful not to burn your tongue as usually the dumplings are filled with some broth. You can easily spend less then $10 and feed two people. THE VALUE! Owners are nice if you speak a little Mandarin, they were ecstatic when my cousin asked if he could teach him how to make dumplings."}
{"text":"Was craving dumplings and this restaurant is close by so decided to go have dinner here. I've been here before and felt that the food was better. Amongst 2 of us we have 1 plate of pan fried dumpling, one plate of long fried dumpling( wor teep?) a fried pork thing and red bean pancake.  The fried pork thing tasted pretty bad. I was expecting it to be crunchy cause it was fried... it was flimsy and the batter did not taste good at all.  The red bean pancake and others were fine. Nothing special.  Most likely won't go back even though it's close by. I rather drive a bit further to get my dumpling fix."}
{"text":"Excellent Shanghai food for a great price. Located on Silver Star Blvd, this restaurant is a fairly small and physically in need of some renovations. The food however makes it well worth it!   I'd recommend ordering steamed dumplings as they are made fresh and come at a great price! There are a number of fillings (different meats and veggies) that you can pick from. The onion pancake is another worthy mention to try.  I'd visit again!"}
{"text":"Really good food and reasonable price. Their meatball soup is delightful and pretty much every dish I tried was on par with my expectations. The atmosphere is friendly and casual and the place is nested in a plaza filled with food. Parking can get painful during rush hour but if you don't mind a short walk there's always parking at the No Frill's at least!"}
{"text":"4.5   I previously wrote about Northern Dumpling Kitchen being my fav dumpling spot.  New Northern Dumplings is easily a close second.  Pros: Dumplings are pretty good. Real good value Nice staff  Cons: Staff's English is not as good  First off, New Northern Dumplings has no affiliation with Northern Dumpling Kitchen whatsoever.  The names are similar and that's about it.  When you walk in, it has a 90's Chinese eatery feel.  I don't know how to explain it.  It just feels like a place I went to eat a lot at when I was growing up in Hong Kong.  This place has a wide assortment of food besides dumplings.  They have many Northern Chinese style dishes.  One thing you notice is that the prices are all very good for whatever it is.  We had some questions and at first i try to ask in English.  I quickly found it was easier to ask questions in Chinese.  The server was really nice and polite, but we found he was a little confused by what we were asking when speaking in English.  This is not a huge thing for me, but could be troublesome for someone who doesn't speak Chinese.  We ordered the lamb skewers, pork and fennel dumplings, soup filled dumplings and a veggie noodle.  The lamb skeweres were very good and at 5 for $5.99, a great deal.  Pork and Fennel Dumplings were very good as well.  You could smell the fennel as bite in which is always a good thing.  We actually ordered a pork and veggie noodle and they brought out a veggie noodle by mistake.  We just said we would have it because the servers were really nice and we didn't want to make a fuss.  The noodle was very good though.  I loved the texture of the noodles that were consistent throughout the meal.  The soup filled dumplings were my only bit of real disappointment.  Most places offer 6 per order.  New Northern Dumplings give you 8 per order.  They are a bit smaller though.  This is where it works against them.  The premise behind the dumpling is that there is soup filled in the dumpling.  Because the dumplings are smaller, there's basically no soup.  A small nitpick but if you're a dumpling connoisseur, it will bother you.  I talked about the value that comes with Northern Kitchen, this places is even better in some regard.  You get 15 dumplings for $5.  I have not found a better deal in the city so far.  Northern Dumpling Kitchen is still my fav spot for dumplings but this place really gives it a run for it's money!"}
{"text":"My favourite type of Chinese food is Northern Chinese food. At this restaurant, they make their own dumplings here AND it's for a cheap price ($4.99 for about 16 pieces - I don't remember exactly how many pieces). I also enjoy their beef soup noodle because the noodles were chewy - again, exactly how I like it. We finished the meal off with a red bean paste fried cake that was done well. Hot, crunchy and fresh with a generous amount of red bean paste on the inside."}
{"text":"Good dumplings with good company. The dumplings were inexpensive, with a low price tag of $5 or $6 for 15 dumplings. Personally, I felt the steamed dumplings did not have much flavour, which was a bit disappointing. The pan-fried dumplings were flavourful and had a nice crispy skin that wasn't chewy and thick.   Word of warning: My dad enjoys lamb a lot so I ordered lamb dumplings for him. He personally found it to be too gamey and strong.  Overall, a good experience. I left there feeling satisfied and full."}
{"text":"Ok honestly, this is a hidden gem, and the best northern chinese food you'll find in York region area. Fresh delicious dumplings, noodles, side dishes, can't really go wrong on most things on the menu.   Price wise, amazing, don't know how they do it. 15 dumplings for $4.99, and they taste better than most of the other more expensive places.   Decor is typical chinese place, but honestly, I'm not gonna rate it on decor, because the price is beyond fair and food is AWESOME.   Definitely help spread the word about this place as they don't seem to get a lot of traffic yet, would be a shame if they closed down!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't discover this place until now. It's my go to at the moment. They have a stir fry cabbage with chilli which is absolutely mouth watering! I've had their steamed leek and pork dumplings which is delicious. Surprisingly I wasn't a huge fan of their pan fried dumplings... a little too dry for my liking. When there's a bigger group of people I love ordering the pickled meat vermicelli in soup! So delicious. It's a small cute little shop with super polite staff. Everytime I leave my tummy feels super satisfied. Highly recommended! They're cash only !"}
{"text":"Giving this place 4.5. Good food, service, prices and ambiance. Reduced half a star because the green onion pancake and beef noodles were a tad too salty for my taste (granted, I generally cook/eat more bland). In addition to the food items just mentioned, we also ordered pork and chives dumplings. $5.50 (or $5.99? Forgot...) for 15 dumplings was awesome. Dumplings were on point and not too salty. First time here tonight, but will deflect be back!"}
{"text":"Was here last night, ordered: Lamb skewers, $6.99 Pan-fried 12 dumplings, $5.99 Pork hock dish. Sweet shrimps dish, $9.99 Tofu, Shanghai style. Wonton soup, $5.99 Noodle dish.   Lamb skewers were not worth it. The wontons in the soup were small. The rest were just ok. Prices were at par with its chef's lack of cooking skill."}
{"text":"It's very dark inside the restaurant.  I guess maybe hydro cost is going up?    Server would openly sneeze without covering his/her mouth onto the food prep table.   I suspect that they never wash their hands before touching your food too?  When the server gave us the menu it was covered with flours from his hands.  Surprisingly the food tasted okay.  I don't think I'll visit again though."}
{"text":"After reading all the glowing reviews, I had to go taste this place out.  It did not disappoint, everything was top notch and the flavors spot on!  Decor was OK, just interesting and very distinct.  The menu was extensive and I wanted one of everything.  Guess I will need to make a few more trips to try out everything. :)"}
{"text":"One can get confused really easily... Especially with the turnover of all these Northern Chinese Restaurant in Scarborough...  I almost lost count...  I think this is the 3rd dumpling restaurants at this location within this 2 years...   Same Decoration... Similar Menu.... Same Tables and Chairs... A new restaurant - New Northern Dumplings.  Of course I need to have the dumplings... my usual dumplings of choice:  Steamed Pork and Chives Dumplings ($4.99) - The wrapping is really really thin.. I can almost see the soup inside - be gentle when you pick it up with your chopsticks... because if you break the skin, all the soup inside would be drained out - Please don't stuff the whole dumpling into your mouth when it is boiling hot.. you will regret it... I am talking from experience!  Service is cold and efficient...   10% Grand Opening Special  I might come back to try other things on their menu... no lunch specials though!"}
{"text":"Place is clean and simple. Service is very straightforward and attentive. Price is amazing!!!!  I would certainly recommend the boiled steamed dumplings...delicious! The filing was fresh and made with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just crave some good cheap dumplings. Especially my favorite soup dumplings. Reviews mentioned about their soup dumplings but It's no longer on their menu. I've even specifically ask the waitress and was disappointed that they don't sell it! The selection of dumplings are also a little slim. Besides the let down, they have a few unique dumpling combinations like pork and pickled radish, pork and zucchini (which we tried) comes in a set of 15 for 5 bucks. We came as a group of two so we didn't have quota to try many dishes. We also tried the pork and pickled raddish noodle soup (it's not the same as the leafy - mui choi though). Broth was simple and decent but nothing special. The dumplings had a little bit more dough than meat ratio. Overall dumpling restaurants generally dont fail me. This hasn't either but it won't be replacing my favorite dumpling joint. At the end it was just 11 bucks for 2 people so I can't complain!"}
{"text":"Recommended by a wife's friend.    Delicious dumplings and the skewered lamb.  Not sure what the rub is, but delicious nonetheless.  The dumplings are 'small' but pack the flavour inside.   They also sell dumplings by the bunch frozen for future consumption, not a bad price.   The green onion pancake is the best I've had so far.   Not dry, chewy, or flavourless like others.   Will go back again."}
{"text":"Becoming the go to dumpling place right now. The fried tofu cubes in their vinegary sweet sauce was really good. Value is good as well as dumplings were reasonably priced.  Only downside is their chilli sauce on their tables are not spicy at all and did not have any taste really."}
{"text":"This is our latest favourite spot for dumplings. If you are looking for juicy dumpling with great taste and awesome price, this is the place to be. However if you are looking for decor, then there's next to none.   We order the same things every time: steam dumpling (Lamb ones for 6.99, pork and leek and other similar ones for 4.99), Lamb skewers (5 skewers for 5.99), hot and sour soup noodles (4.99) and a random item.   More than enough for 3 Ppl and around $20 for bill."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the restaurants I alway come back to (probably once every 2 weeks to at least once a month - honestly). Their food is the ultimate definition of comfort food.   I would consider their dishes to be authentic Northern Mandarin food, with a specialty in dumplings. In fact, if you head to the back, you can often see the workers making fresh dumplings behind a screen.   Their decor is quite old, but they've been around for a while and you can honestly overlook all that once you've had a taste of their amazing dishes. Whether it's lunchtime or dinnertime, their store will always be busy, but it's big enough that you don't need to wait for a table.   The dishes I would recommend every time I go back would be: - Their specialty dumplings (there are so many varieties to choose from). They used to only offer the dumplings in a steamed version but they recently changed it so they offer the option for the dumplings to be boiled or pan fried as well.  - Their \"guo tie.\" These are basically longer dumplings that are pan fried to PERFECTION. They offer it in \"pork and leek\" and \"pork and onion.\" Dip these in vinegar and taste the crunchiness. You would be making a mistake to miss out on these! - Pancake with beef and sauce. Crispy to the max!!! - Tomato and egg soup. Basic Chinese dish but they just make it so good here.  - Wonton soup. For those who love the traditional mainland wontons with less fillings and super soft wonton skin.  - Tossed mung clear noodles in sauce.  - Meat balls with Chinese cabbage in pot.   Overall their food is amazing, and consistently good every time you order. Their portions are huge and the price is cheap. Finally, the food comes super fast and and their workers are attentive and super friendly! I cannot praise this hidden gem of a restaurant any more than I already have so try it for yourselves."}
