{"text":"I moved to the neighbourhood a few months ago, and Jerrys is a place that I have been planning to visit for quite some time, as a fish and chips lover. My wife and I walked over tonight (unfortunately the hours are tight as it is run by the owner and his wife - so we had to get in before 7pm).  The staff were super friendly, and the service, though the food prep was a bit slow, was prompt and accommodating. We both had the halibut dinners, which consisted of a giant piece of halibut over thick, crisp, fresh-cut fries, with a giant portion of ample greek salad. The salad was well-dressed, with lots of feta cheese, big chunks of tomato, green peppers, and onions. The batter on the fish was a bit on the greasy side, but was a nice consistency - not too crispy but not too soft. The fish was tender, soft, and flavourful.  I left incredibly satiated, with the delicious taste in my mouth. I would absolutely recommend Jerry's, and I intend to become a regular!"}
{"text":"I came to Jerry's because my relatives go here all the time for fish and chips in their neighbourhood. I really enjoyed the food and we were given gigantic servings of fish. The batter on the fish is a tad bit thicker than most other fish and chips joints, but I didn't mind. The coleslaw was also delicious because it wasn't the creamy type, but made with more of a vinegar of some sort...I kind of like that better. The place was run by a really nice, outgoing guy (Jerry?) who was talkative with everyone that came in. Seating was sort of cramped, so I'd probably either get takeout or dine with just 1 or 2 people.- My relatives and I took up almost the entire restaurant.  Yep, I'd say go here for fish and chips if you are in the area."}
{"text":"A-OK? No...just OK.  The first of our breakfast group arrived at 9:05, and Jerry was just opening the restaurant, though the posted hours are 8am...  **One year later. Never leave a review for a year before completing it.**  ...and besides the breakfast being average, the place smelled like a fish 'n chip place, which is great if you are going for fish 'n chips, but not so great if you are going for breakky. I guess we should'a known."}
{"text":"I have noticed Jerry's absolutely accidentally and I was so exited to see a fish and chips in the area that I rushed to try it. Their hours are not exactly convenient as on most days they close at 7pm and only on Thu and Fri at 8 pm. What a shame because my Thu and Fri are normally reserved for more upscale outings, but I put some extra effort to visit them on Wednesday. That effort did not pay off, although they specialize in halibut (my favorite) their batter leaves lots to be desired. It is too thick and greasy and is not cooked well throughout. The scallops are tiny and shrimps also have a ton of extra batter on them. Perhaps the thing I liked the most was the salad. No clam chowder either....sigh. The prices are alright, seafood platter which is like a sampler of seafood + halibut is around 16, comes with fries and salad. I am still looking for fnc place in North York to call my favorite, but Jerry's did not make the cut."}
