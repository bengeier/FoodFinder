{"text":"Hands down one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. From the decor to the friendly and knowledgeable wait staff to the absolutely incredible food, you will not leave this place disappointed."}
{"text":"Apple strudel and pancakes were some of the best I've ever had. Sparkling apple juice and coffee are delicious and the wait staff were very attentive."}
{"text":"Brunch:  My lady ordered the very pretty quiche Loraine. At first we thought maybe we would split our dishes between the two of us, unfortunately, I wasn't wearing my dress that Sunday morning to be able to legitimately eat something called \"quiche\" and feel like a man about it. Although, I did manage to bum a few bites though; manly bites... while growing chest hair, changing a flat tire and storing a pack of cigarettes in a stab wound.  The quiche was filled with bacon and floating clouds of cheese that deflated at each bite in the creamy eggs that were next to custard. All bound together with a buttery crust whose flakes found the corners of our mouthes as little reminders of pastry pleasantries for later consumption... OMG, the quiche effect is taking its toll on my writing. HOCKEY, JACKHAMMERS and CHAINSAWS. The omelette pie was sided with a lightly dressed toss of watercress, parsley, shaved cucumbers and dill whose pepper notes cut through the richness."}
{"text":"Avoid. Initially, the menu sounds appetizing, in the trend of the up and coming québécois nouvelle cuisine. Oh were we disappointed. Overpriced and poor quality. The portions are ridiculously small. The food is surprisingly low grade. The atmosphere is nice but really doesn't offset the disappointments. This place almost qualifies as a scam. Head down mt royal avenue, for more and better options."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch restaurant, and my spectacularly wonderful girlfriend enjoys it immensely as well."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Montreal. Everything about it is very unique, from the flavours, to the cozy interior. Every single plate I have eaten here it's been mind blowing. I just have one negative thing to say: I asked for a whiskey sour one time and the price was something really low, like 7$. We commented on how cheap it was. Last time I went I ordered another one and the price had gone up to something like 10 or 11$."}
{"text":"Went here for Brunch on Sunday and it was fantastic. The food was very tasty and filling with portions just the right size. Service was pleasant and the atmosphere quiet and relaxing. Will come back again for sure!"}
{"text":"This to me is the perfect Montreal restaurant , casual and comfortable . The food is brilliant and innovative , Chef Derek Dammann is a humble genius , and a great guy to chat with if your sitting at the bar . Felix Gagne the quintessential  host and when making a reservation goes out of his way to be accommodating and engaging . The whole staff is wonderful . To me this place rates in my top 20 restaurants in the world."}
{"text":"As a recent immigrant to Quebec, and living two blocks away from this restaurant I was excited to try it out. I am currently trying to learn French and assimilate into the French culture. I went here with my two friends visiting from the Northwest Territories and had the worst service because we spoke English. Even when I tried to speak French he would revert to English in a rude and impatient manner. I am a server and have been for many years as well as a manger. I don't demand too much but we were there to eat and drink and left without ordering much because of this server. I hate to give a bad review but I also hate discrimination and as a person trying to speak French this was disheartening. I hope that is was just a bad night and something was on his mind.  Good luck in the future, but you will never have my service again."}
{"text":"This is in my top 3 of Montreal. Super relaxed ambiance. Amazing food. Great staff. You just want to come here once a week and be happy."}
{"text":"N'allez pas à ce resto! Qualité du service est totalement défaillante. Le serveur était bête. Nous avons été accueilli avec un bonjour grognon en nous regardant à peine. À la prise de la commande, il ne donnait aucun détail sur les plats et le menu. On nous a dit de regarder l'ardoise qui se trouve dans la salle principale. Comme nous étions dans la pièce adjointe, nous avons dû nous levé pour faire notre choix. Après avoir insisté pour avoir des informations supplémentaires, le serveur a fini par nous faire grâce de détails. Il parlait trop vite en regardant le plafond. Nous n'avons rien compris.  Pendant le service, les plats ont été servis en laissant tomber les plats sur la tables.   Pendant le repas nous avons demandé du pain. Nous avons obtenu trois morceaux de pain (coupé en deux). Nous étions quatre personnes. Nous avons redemandé du pain. Deux fois.   Pour la nourriture, rien d'exceptionnelle. Les plats sont nettement trop cher. Le plat de penne (qui contient, à mon souvenir, 9 pâtes) au pesto coute 22$.   Déconseillé! Plein de bons resto dans le coin!"}
{"text":"NEVER GOING BACK.  When I made reservations for a group of 9 people, I was told that we would not be able to order a la carte and the staff recommended a family style menu at 70$ a head, not including alcohol or tip.  Once we got to the restaurant, waiter told us that group menus were 55$ a person. Already off to a bad start.  If I can resume my experience in 3 statements:  -HORRIBLE SERVICE: We were seated at 8:00 pm and only got our first entree around 9:00 pm. We actually waited 30 minutes between each service and the minute I complained about it the food started to magically appear out of the kitchen at a quicker pace. My opinion was that the waiter was trying to get us to spend more money on wine by slowing down the service. Thumbs down.  -HORRIBLE AMBIANCE: Music was way too loud, temperature was insanely hot it was a sauna in there. A restaurant that small, packed with that many people and with that kind of ''reputation'' should be able to afford decent air conditioning for clients. I was literally drenched in sweat by the time our main course arrived. Not a pleasant dining experience to say the least.  -AVERAGE FOOD: Food was ok but nothing to brag home about, and whoever gave this restaurant anything higher than a 3 star rating must be a tourist. Oh, and get this: the wine list only has CANADIAN WINES. And they're not cheap either.   My cousin was visiting from Italy and we wanted to show him a good time on his first night in Montreal, and instead his and my whole family's experience at Maison Publique RUINED our evening. We were so glad to get the bill and get the hell out.  Very disappointed and will go out of my way to tell people how horrible this restaurant is."}
{"text":"If you like chain restaurants and think you should have 2 sides with your meal this is not the place for you. They serve small plate style dishes here, everything is a la carte, it best to order to share. Order a few items at a time and they will filter out of the kitchen as they are finished. They will bring it all at once if you request it but frankly that's not the experience you should be after here. The menu is on the wall and changes frequently from the looks of it.  Staff was very attentive and helpful as our French is non existent. It was explained that they really try to source from Quebec first, Canada second, and lastly elsewhere. Our evening started off with drinks I had a local beer and my wife a local cidre.  Our waiter explained the specials and the feast commenced. We started off with the stuffed oyster, Lebanese lamb tartare, and Asian style greens. The oyster arrived first and what an oyster, the size of my hand stuffed with onions, herbs, cheese, and more. Very rich and filling as we finished that tartare and greens arrived. The tartare was prepared excellently with middle eastern spice and a tzatziki style sauce. The greens were amazing garlic, chilies, soy sauce, and dry-salted cured pork. Being pleased with everything so far we pressed on wanting to savor every bite our last night out in Montreal. Me moved on to the fried rabbit and clam special. The rabbit was tender and tasty broken down into quarters and lightly fried. The clams came with an amazing broth garlic, chilis, and herbs. Skipping dessert was not an option having seen them go by to other diners as we ate. A seasonal rhubarb parfait was the perfect way to end my meal, my wife couldn't resist the pot de creme, a rich smooth chocolate custard. C'est fini!"}
{"text":"I just don't get what the fuss is about.  It is a beautiful room, that is for sure.   But the quality of the food is so inferior in a town where it is so easy to have better... The Pot au Feu was a disgusting rendition of this classic dish, spongey, tasteless, and boring - a bland broth with 3 carrots and 3 potatoes floating in it.  And it's not cheap!  2 glasses of wine, a small app and a $20 entrée, ended up being $75 with tip!  Go for a drink at the bar and maybe an entrée, and you can enjoy the atmosphere and enjoy a nice dinner somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Super tasty, fun atmosphere, friendly staff, this cool place was a real treat. Went with friends that are gluten free and they took such great care of us, it was clear that the food is prepared right then and there by truly caring chefs.  A thoroughly pleasant night with delicious and interesting eats."}
{"text":"The Caesar (drink) is hands down the best I've had in the city, maybe ever.   As I watched the bartender (who looks more than a little like Eric Balfour from Six Feet Under) making it, I knew it was going to be good. It was spicyyy, perfectly seasoned and rimmed with...pickling spices, I believe.  It came with a circle of sausage on the rim that was so delicious, It left me wanting more.  The only caveat?  It was $12.00.   We also ordered the Clams Casino.. and they were not very good.  My husband had to spit his out into the napkin.  We didn't try anything else, though, which is probably a good thing, because for the clams, caesars and 2 beers our bill was $70.  it hurt a little.  but we still talk about that caesar."}
{"text":"Excellent meal, great service. Did the 7 course tasting menu for $55. Highlights were the giant oyster and the butterscotch dessert. Their house cider was also nice.  Would definitely come back for another meal, and would be sure to order those items again."}
{"text":"Great Atmosphere Small cozy place Feel good neighborhood restaurant Great service Sharing plates  Not really into celebrity chef restaurants, those usually tend to be, overpriced,underwhelming and simply awful. This was like a breath of fresh air, surprisingly good experience.The sharing plates is what makes it unique,worthwhile and keeps the diners talking,laughing sharing and above all having fun.Casually. If you're in the neighborhood do try it out. It's way better than reviews indicate. Try the foie gras parfait."}
{"text":"Emplacement sympathique et décoration réussie. Toutefois, service décevant et nonchalant. Plats intéressants, mais dispendieux pour la portion et le service médiocre. Surtout pour les déjeuners, alors que le café n'est pas inclus avec les plats. À essayer une fois, peut-être vous y trouverez votre compte."}
{"text":"Meh.  Everything was overpriced.  It is rare for me to post a non-positive review, however because of all the hype this place enjoys due to its celebrity chef status, I feel obliged to give this honest and balanced critique.  To start with a positive, the atmosphere is attractive and seeks to evoke a cozy pub-style feel.  We arrived about a half hour after opening and already several tables were seated.  We got a small table in the back.  The tables are not laid - there is a drawer in the table for you to pull your own roll-up out of.  Also, there are no menus, which although likely intended to be a cool shtick, was very annoying.  The very nice waiter told us their beers and we ordered.  These are the same local beers we had been drinking at other places all week, however, when the bill came we learned that here they were priced at $9, even though everywhere else they were $6 - 8.  So, there are no menus.  You have to get up from your table to walk over to a place where you can read the board (pictured on the website) and not be in the way of servers and other patrons while you figure out what to order.  As you can see, titles and prices, with no descriptions.  Our waiter came by and tried to explain some of the dishes to us.  It was all slightly confusing and annoying.  We ordered a dish with smoked meats and mustard and arugula (14) and the duck ravioli (25).  The arugula dish was tasty as a shared salad and we enjoyed it.  The $25 ravioli consisted of FIVE raviolis with a bit of sauce and nothing else on the plate.  $5 per ravioli??  Also, no bread or pre-meal type appetizer (flatbread, olives, nuts, etc.) were brought to the table.  After this we ordered two desserts at 9 and 10 which were both okay, although definitely overpriced, and called it a night. When the waiter brought the bill, we were informed that we could purchase a copy of the chef's new cookbook for $30 cash on our way out.   The bill came to about $100 which we had spent on dinners at several other places during the week, however, those dinners were much more substantial and enjoyable.  If not for our late lunch that day, we likely would have left hungry, and were very disappointed with our dining experience here.  Although this place enjoys some celebrity status, we did not get a good value at all, and wished we had eaten elsewhere."}
{"text":"Super poor service. We made a reservation in advance and when we got there there were no tables available. They never apologized. They didn't even tell us how much we were supposed to wait. We waited for a half-hour (HALF-HOUR!) and at that point I asked the hostess if she could give us at least courtesy drinks and she gave us a very unpleasant attitude. Super rude. We left."}
{"text":"This small restaurant has a lot of charm, perfect dinner place for couples. For a change the menu in on the wall on a black board. Don't be surprised if you see people taking pictures of that board. I was seated next to it, therefore I didn't take any pictures. The place is a bit dark, wich makes it an even cosier place for the winter season. You will find inside, on the shelves, old and retro items from books to figurines.   The food is very good, it is a very well know establishment, where your taste buds will be more than happy.  We had the oyster au four, magret de canard and the fish of the day.  The oyster was amazing made with beer, ognon and a bechamel sauce.  The magret de canard was tender and melting. And the fish with beats was good.   The plate are served one after the other and are made to be shared. Under the table you will find a small drawer with cutlery and napkins.  They serve amazing drinks, we had a casual gin tonic.  Finally, i can say that the service was very decent, our waiter was more than happy to explain each plate and what comes with it."}
{"text":"Going into my visit, I was a little skeptical due to the mixed reviews this place has but I left thoroughly satisfied. The restaurant is located in a beautiful, quiet residential area and really adds to the restaurant's laid back ambience. The restaurant itself is small, cozy and casual.  Our waiter was very welcoming and service throughout the evening was solid. I've read complaints about the prices, but there seems to be something for every price range and at the end of the day, quality costs money and the food and ingredients warrant that cost. No complaints there.  The menu consists of plates that are designed for sharing. We shared the foie gras parfait, the beef tartare, the fried rabbit and the leg of lamb with potatoes. All four were delicious with the rabbit standing out the most. Between those four dishes and a few beers and cocktails each, our bill came out to about $150 tax/tip in. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"It took 40 mins to get a table. Serving time took over three hours. It was a nice place but not for the group event I was with. Probably better for brunch."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place.  I will list the goods and the bads, but the goods give them the 5 star, despite the other reviews I just read here on Yelp.  Here is what we had:   1.  BRUNCH FOR TWO:  Incredible array of meats.  The pork chop was amazing-the most delicious I have ever had-benefiting from a good brine that makes this chop flavorful and far more juicy than any pork chop I remember.    Boudin noir-homemade-was different than anything I have had in Montreal-it was light and delicate, with the pork fat having been cofited making it tender but adding a nice texture.  The mace flavor and onlions were noticeably large in the dish.  In fact, I think this was different than black pudding from England, german style blood sausage, Lunenbourg pudding from Nova Scotia, boudin from France or even Korean Sundae.  Here they make it with oats, which is not always done with the others I have listed.   Bacon;  among the very best in MOntreal-very smoky and a good amount of salt from their brining. Reasonably lean compared to many bacons.  Montreal happens to be a great bacon town, if you know where to go.    Marrow-nice, but not that different than other marrows.   Egg:  extremely well cooked over easy.   Beans: very delicious-though I have no expertise here-they were definately different from the one's I have had.  Sausage;  excellent homemade sausage.    Kid test-they loved it.  But this place is a little slow on the service to have a good kid experience, though we had a decent time of it today.    2.  TURNOVER:  Incredible, one of the most amazing, with a delicate pastry that was delicious and crisp.   3.  QUICHE:  The most unusual quiche with lots of creamy richness and some flavors I couldn't identify.  The bacon or ham was extremely smoky, giving this a very unusual and almost English flavoring.   4.  COFFEE:  Excellent Kenyan with a bit more character and acidity than most coffees.  The roast was deep and well balanced.   I wanted to try the \"egg sandwich\" and the \"bison tongue sandwich which our neighbors raved about, but the meal was already over the top too much.   CHEF:  Great chef formerly of DNA.  He belongs here much more-this is the appropriate setting for his skills.  Can't wait to try dinner here.   WAITER:  Friendly and helpful, but always in a bit of a hurry to get away.  Also, there could be a little better explanation of what to expect from the different dishes on the menu (example;  the egg sandwich is a very small item.  Also, he encouraged us to order sides for the kids-quite unnecessary and pricey given the amount of food)  BAD STUFF:  Slow preparation-perhaps a bit slower than is necessary.  The cooks moved a bit slower than cooks tend to.  They are obviously intreseted in \"slow food\" style, but that doesn't mean moving slow.  But they were knowlegeable and dedicated nonetheless after talking to one of them.   SLow delivery of simple things-it took quite some time to get some hot water.   Balance-it is hard to balance a meal that is so much protein-and one could not expect it here.   Price-Quite high for the items, but worth it nonetheless.  I would share the brunch for two amongst 5-6 people in the future and have a few sides.  That would be a reasonably priced meal.  We sepnt about 100 on 2 adults and 2 children which for brunch is quite pricey.    Menu:  handwritten and abbreviated-a bit too \"cool\".   How about handwritten with some explanation?  Has the photocopier been discovered in this part of MOntreal yet?     INFORMATION:  Alternative meals;  They should be a great choice to try for dinner.  Brunch is only 2 days a week.  They were very crowded by 11:00 having opened their doors at 10:30  I give this place a 5 star.  I would give it the same rating in Manhattan.  This is a keeper, but you never know in Montreal."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a Saturday night. We were seated immediately. The waiter was very welcoming and the service was excellent. Think of this as British tapas, the plates are intended to be shared. The winter vegetable plate was as good as the first time we were here and being seated in a corner this time... I could lick the plate! Yes, it was that good. In fact the experience this time was so good that I'm looking forward to going again (which is unusual for me.) Best to go with friend who you want to share with, since everything is intended to be shared."}
{"text":"I love pancakes. Especially on a Sunday - for some odd reason. And I'm picky about my pancakes. I want them to be golden brown and ever so slightly crispy on the exterior edges - but fluffy without being dense. And I want real maple syrup with my pancakes. And bacon. Because, well, it's bacon!!  Back home in Montreal my very favourite place for pancakes is Maison Publique in the Plateau area. Incidentally, I once lived in that very neighbourhood. But of course, I only discovered Maison Publique after I had moved away. Still, I'd make a trek there - for their pancakes, which are topped with their crispy bacon and some hot peppers...giving it just the right kick! And let's not forget the real maple syrup. Yup, this is the real deal. You're welcome in advance ;-)"}
{"text":"Belle ambiance, très bon service. Notre serveuse a su nous donner de bonnes explications sur le menu (indispensables, car chaque plat est décrit en environ deux mots sur l'ardoise). Or,  - la nourriture aurait pu être excellente si elle n'était pas trop salée. Presque tous les plats commands étaient trop salés, de l'uf diablo (je crois) en passant par les calmar géants. - les prix sont relativement chers comparativement à ce que l'on retrouve ailleurs.  Je souhaite tout de même que ce nouveau restaurant puisse trouver sa place. J'y retournerai à conditions qu'il y ait des améliorations aux deux points notés ci-haut."}
{"text":"Where to start?  Great atmosphere, great food and even greater service. They were incredibly accommodating: we had three kids under 10 and a vegan and they handled it with grace and class. The chef prepared a special vegan meal for us and brought free ice cream for the kids. It certainly wasn't cheap but one of the more memorable meals we've enjoyed in a long while. I recommend for both tourists and locals."}
{"text":"Très belle découverte ! Souper entre amis avec partage façon tapas de plusieurs plats. Les papilles se délectent autour d'une bonne bouteille. Les prix sont très raisonnables en comparaisons de ces restaurants branchés du Plateau.  Les plats sont fins, recherchés et vraiment goûteux. Nous avons eu un service très agréable et personnalisé. Nous avons eu droit à des plats supplémentaire offert par le propriétaire qui nous a fait découvrir d'autres mets.  L'ambiance est décontracté dans un cadre façon relais de chasse mélangé avec un pub anglais. C'est chaleureux et on s'y sent rte  vite comme à la maison. D'ailleurs on ne s 'y trompe pas car vous trouverez dans le tiroir de votre table votre serviette et vos couverts.  J'ai passé un très agréable moment et j'ai très envie d'y retourner pour déguster les autres plats qui me faisaient envie !"}
{"text":"The menu is on the wall with only about a dozen or so items. Even then, there were 3 prospective patrons that stood in front of the menu wall for a good 20 minutes, staring, contemplating, inquiring about items, etc. I found it entertaining...  We had a great server who explained the specials and beer list very well. The beer options are not plentiful, but still good craft options.  The foie gras mousse was decadent. I should have asked if my friend actually wanted it, instead myself being forced to scarf down two huge scoops of foie.  The oysters with tiny pasta was a large and delicious portion.  The fried rabbit was unfortunately very over salted. I like salty food, but every small bite of this dish needed a drink of water. Even as a leftover the next day, I tried my best to justify the dish, but it was just verging on inedible.  I hate to let one dish completely ruin an experience. I'd give them another shot."}
{"text":"Just checked this out April 2017. Ranked 11 in Canada, so was expecting a lot. I was also happy to venture back to my old neighbourhood East Plateau.   Half the pleasure of going to this restaurant is it's great corner local neighbourhood restaurant vibe and super friendly staff. The Old fashioned was almost the best I've ever had (the best being my husband's old fashioned w brandies cherries & orange slice). The food & wine was also great. You order several sharing plates and the kitchen decides the order to serve them to you. Loved the crab tarte, beer salad and capellacio. I wasn't a big fan of the Welsh Rarebit but I may have been too full. But not full enough, since I gobbled down the amazing chocolate lava cake w cherries.   A great plateau meal experience. Only recommendation would be to have more salad / veggie options. A solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"To give this restaurant anything but five starts would be a sin.  We came in for dinner on a Sunday night and got the best two seats in the house:  right at the bar, looking into the open window to the kitchen.  Our server, the bartender, was fantastic.  He had an excellent personality, he was very attentive, and he was knowledgeable of the food and the wine served.  He recommended a great Cabernet Franc from Ontario, and convinced us to do the chef's tasting menu.  Our server seemed particularly tickled that we had absolutely no preferences of what to order, and left ourselves completely in the hands of the chef and himself.  From our first course (an amazing toast with the most luxurious whipped foie gras), I knew this place was a winner.  Course after course arrived at the table. Each one was perfectly on point.  There was only one dish that I did not fancy, it was a polish meatloaf-type dish, but I'm sure it was executed well, it is merely a personal preference.  Not only were the dishes selected amazing, but they were varied in texture, flavor, spice, and variety.  In addition to being delicious, the food was plentiful.  This is the first time I've had a tasting menu that we literally had to request the chef STOP sending out dishes.  One more bite of this amazing food and I would have been over the limit.  So, instead, I successfully negotiated a round of bourbon in lieu of dessert courses.  This was a win for us, as we couldn't imagine eating any more of the amazing offerings.  In summary, Maison Publique is a winner.  I travel excessively and always seek out the best-of-the-best in the culinary world.  This meal is clearly in the top five meals I've ever consumed. Well done, Miason Publique.  When my travels take me back to Montreal, you and I will meet again."}
{"text":"After so many experiences there, now I get why it got such a \"meh\" overall review here.   I made sure to call and book a table for my daughter and I. She is very well behaved and kept herself busy with toys so no, her behaviour did not affect my waiter's service.  He was not friendly and when it was time to pay, I was still calculating his tip and he rushly asked if I needed any hangs back. To which I replied no... since I felt it needed a bit more $ since the food was amazing, as usual.   I was a frequent customer and I am unfortunately no longer one because of that specific experience.  ** I used to sit at the bar and today was my first time at a table. So maybe the ambiance tends to differ a bit regarding where you chose to sit. Which I personally think it shouldn't but oh well. Farewell Maison Publique :( You used to be in my top 5 in town**"}
{"text":"Wow. One of the best meals I've had in Montreal. Every single dish we ordered was above excellent. Service was a little weird, though. It took kind of forever to get the waiter's attention, because he was very busy with several other tables. And when we ordered (one entrée and one main each) we were informed, rather than asked, that we would be sharing every dish, because they would come out of the kitchen one at a time. Ok then, that wasn't the plan, but fine....  And then the food started to arrive and we forgot about the rest!!! We had the pâté de foie and the horse carpaccio, then the tuna and the quail. All perfect, ingredients and flavours perfectly blending together. For dessert, the 'milles crêpes'. I can't even tell which was my favourite part. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I really like their brunches. Delicious pancakes served with real maple syrup and thick bacon, delicious quiche, eggs and blood sausage, etc. the menu is up on the board and changes on a regular basis. No espresso machine, but all you can drink coffee. The most important thing to know before you show up there is that you need to have plenty of time. I usually get there after the rush so it doesn't take too long to have a table, but service is slow (though friendly). Once I got there at 12:30pm asking for a table for 3 and we waited about 45 min. (They had told us 15-20min...) Still, it is on my list of places I recommend for days when you want to take your time. I don't know how it is at night as a pub because I have never been in the evening."}
{"text":"MP serves up consistently wonderful and creative food at a very reasonable price. We've eaten here too many times to count and have also held a private work party here (they made a massive feast for us. So good!). The staff are amazing---front-of-house man Felix is always a charming and welcoming host, and the owner/chef Derek keeps on cranking out unique, delicious grub and is usually on hand, supervising the crew and greeting guests. All in all, it's a cozy, home-away-from-home sorta place where you get to eat like a king. The smoked rabbit is excellent and, if you ever go and they have any sort of pasta on the menu, it's a must. The focus here is on seasonal, local, ethical produce. MP has cultivated relationships with all sorts of local suppliers who are proud of what they do, and you can taste the love."}
{"text":"Really good simple brunch classics. Highly recommend the Welsh Rarebit. They have an excellent Canadian wine list and a nice line up of different ciders. I understand they have a popular weekend brunch featuring an English breakfast though I've not been to it.Closed Monday and Tuesday."}
{"text":"In August, I was walking with my mom down Marquette to one of my favourite brunch spots, Maison Publique. Before we could see into the full-length window beside the bar, someone in an apron stepped out of the window in front of us. He waved and began picking herbs from the small garden under a tree growing out of the sidewalk. Chef Derek Dammann came into view behind the bar and greeted me with such warmth I was convinced he recognized me from my frequent visits. I introduced him to my mom.  The food here is fearlessly rich - they grill their Croque-monsieur in maple syrup. I find most restaurants are too timid with their hollandaise, but Maison Publique's smoked salmon benny has a bright, lemony flavour. The decor of dark wood and brass trimmings creates the feeling of dining on an expensive yacht, many decades in the past."}
{"text":"Service and food was amazing.  I had the gnocchi, mussels, and Welsh rarebit. The ravioli also looked good. Mussels were delicious.  I also took a bite of the butterscotch pudding dessert (forgot the French name) which was superb.  Highly recommend that--even if you don't have room for dessert--as I did.  Sooooo good!  Ask for recommendations!  Servers were very patient with us Americans (in a party of 8!) and we loved every minute of being there.  They also had a few cider choices which I appreciated."}
{"text":"Totally fell in love with the homemade strawberry jam here!  It is more like a bar than a restaurant, and you can see the chef cooking in front of you if you choose a bar seat. the staffs are nice and friendly.  They change their menu according to the food the farm provide to them everyday, but the blood cake is the regular course. it is with high cholesterol and is a little bit oily but somehow very nice with the running egg.   the dessert of the day is muffin with cream and strawberry jam. Surprisingly delicious"}
{"text":"What a highly unfortunate place. Two stars for sort of feeding my stomach on a night with horrendous weather where every other restaurant was closed in the area and for the nice bartender, but two stars for leaving me $80 poorer, still hungry, and confused as to how this dark, damp bladder of a place even exists.  It was a good thing that I drank a giant beer before getting my food and managed to get slightly tipsy, because the tremendous wait time would otherwise have been unbearable. We got the beef pappardelle, which, while not inedible, could have maybe been enough food for a small cat with cancer. Our other entree, a supposed house special, was the pan-fried rabbit, which just tasted tough and dry. The whole thing was covered in two giant pieces of wet lettuce, obviously rinsed in the sink right before adorning our plate. Was this supposed to be the salad component of the dish, or was it supposed to serve as a canapy cover to hide the scabby rabbit leg? We will never know.  The saddest part of this establishment may have been the fact that it tried to be an \"open air\" kitchen, where you could see the cooks prepare your meal. Now, why anyone would want to watch two young, dumpy looking American amateurs hold a conversation with each other while only half paying attention to the food that they were burning in the pan or groping out of plastic containers with their bare hands is beyond me, but I had a feeling that I knew how the food would taste before it even arrived in front of me.  After we left this place, we went straight to a diner and ordered a burger and fries for $7. We tried not to think about how we could have instead eaten 11 orders of burgers and fries instead of our previous meal."}
{"text":"Had horrible experience and service there. Food was ok. Although I loved this chef when he was at DNA, he seems to have become somewhat of an ass - maybe his association with Jamie Oliver is giving him a big head.   Was impossible to get a smile out of our waiter/floor manager. He also pushed us an expensive bottle of wine when we were looking for 3 glasses of dessert wine - wine was not sold by the glass he told us after opening the bottle and serving us. We didn't really mind in the end, we paid the bill. But afterwards, when we mentioned that he could have warned us, he just ignored us at best. When we raised this issue with the chef/owner, his majesty had a foot on a chair looking down on us and defending his buddy.   It was my bday dinner and we had spent a lot of money in this place. Will never return. Just too bad I have to give at least a star because this place doesn't deserve it"}
{"text":"Five big stars. Derek and his crew crushed it tonight (and from what I understand, every night) with a menu wide open to the chef's open mind. We said a) we are creative eaters and b) we are hungry. From pasta (sage tagliatelle) to seafood (MONSTER 7 year old oyster) to meat (...lots of meat), it was an awesome meal. Great beers and local wines available; super view of the kitchen, rad music selection courtesy of whoever is picking the music. It was a stunning meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Service and food. My son and I went and he is fourteen, I am a chef so he is used to nice restaurant's. I was pleasantly surprised how we weren't treated like the plague. As sometimes happens in happening restaurants. Bravo!   William S Valentine"}
{"text":"Vins canadiens, beaucoup de poissons et fruits de mer, ambiance de pub anglais. Cet endroit est mon préféré depuis plusieurs années. Si vous prenez des pétoncles il y a de fortes chances qu'ils ont été pêchées le matin même."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal! Fois gras Parfait is perfect! Lovely crudités and the steak was melt in your mouth good. From wine selection to finish, a terrific neighbourhood haunt I will frequent. Thank you for a memorable dinner! Next: brunch."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allées pour la première fois à Maison Publique ce matin. Le décor est vraiment sympa, rustique et original comme en témoignent mes photos. PAR CONTRE, nous avons été assez déçues des portions des plats, notamment le saumon fumé qui, pour 12$, consiste en une assiette avec un peu de salade et un peu de saumon... même pas de pain... de quoi avoir encore faim après... L'uf bénédictine n'était vraiment pas copieux non plus, et les autres plat pas tellement plus...  Les prix varient de 10 à 14$, ce qui est raisonnable, mais ce qui devrait permettre de sortir le ventre plein, ce qui n'était pas le cas...  La bouffe était bonne, mais comme je dis, la quantité semble nous faire oublier le goût du plat.. Le service était excellent, rien à dire"}
{"text":"Maison Publique is ranked #21 of Canada's 100 Best Restaurants for 2016. It's a sneaky, inconspicuous restaurant. Their website and the restaurant's atmosphere bely a normal, neighborhood, corner gastropubs. But, their menu and chefs are anything but.  They create a new menu everyday based on the ingredients they can source from local farms and friends; the sockeye salmon came from their fisherman friends in B.C. All four of us decided on the eight course tasting menu. It included salmon carpaccio, smoked rabbit, heirloom tomato and blue cheese salad, home-smoked meats, buffalo pantacotta, and a beautiful spread of desserts. The wine list is all local, there's a full bar, and a wide beer selection.  Easily our best meal so far on our road trip between Saratoga Springs, Kingston and Montreal."}
{"text":"It's small. It feels like a bar/pub. The menu is stapled to a wall. The service is chaotic.  I enjoyed 2 out of the 3 dishes I got to try. Dry-cured deer: Tasty, loved the sweet pickled bell-peppers it came with. Welsh rarebit: No. It's essentially greasy cheese on hard bread and that for $8. Pappardelle with boar ragout: Tasty, loved the addition of orange zest.  They make ridiculously good Bloody Caesars, spicy flavourful awesomejuice. The only other place that makes a Caesar this good is in buttf*ck nowhere Ontario (Buster's BBQ), so I'm happy to have found this place.  I think I'd come back here just to try & share some more of their food, hang out at the bar & fill myself up with spicy goodness (not for brunch though, dinner time only, it just doesn't seem like a brunch type of place to me)."}
{"text":"Just had my third meal which was a Sunday brunch.  Yum!!!  Love their BLT made with beefsteak tomato, bacon, basil, ranch dressing and more.  The asparagus with an egg was also delicious.  Great bar drinks including a mimosa and a spicy ceasar.  We got around 11AM, and had no trouble getting a table for two..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm vegetarian and I ordered the fennel salad with blood oranges which was fabulous. I also ordered the grilled cauliflower and spinach it was so flavorful. The rest of the group thought the food was good but not great and that's why I rated this 4 stars."}
{"text":"The menu changes daily based on availability of local ingredients in season and are cooked to perfection and the service is top-notch. We ordered 8 things for dinner and has 8 foodgasms.  This is one of the top five meals of our lives, and we travel internationally.  We now consider this a must whenever we return to Montreal."}
{"text":"Très bonne bouffe. Vraiment très impressionné par le chef. Le lieu est très sympathique et la serveuse est exceptionnelle. Tout est parfait! On mange local, on mange bien, le concept est très consciencieux de son environnement.  Le maître d'hôtel était un peu rude malheureusement, c'est à travailler, mais dans l'ensemble c'est un endroit à recommander les yeux fermés!"}
{"text":"Who are these people giving five stars to such a horrible restaurant? I almost hope they are tourists. This was in my top five worst restaurant experiences ever. And out of those five it was easily the most expensive.  Bad food plus bad service equals horrible experience.  If you're considering going to this restaurant please remember that you're in Montreal. Dining options are abound.  However if you enjoy a restaurant that runs out of steak at 7:30PM, has a confusing menu, has rude waiters who only want to push the most expensive thing on the menu, if you enjoy a completely raw Porkchop after waiting 90 minutes for it, and then waiting 45 minutes for them to put the exact same piece that you cut into back on the grill before getting it back, and lastly, if you enjoy having a condescending owner tell you that the problem must be you, then this is the restaurant you need to reserve.   Shame on you Maison Publique. And shame on Jamie Oliver for attaching your money grubbing name to this crap hole."}
{"text":"Un tapas qui coûte 48$ pour UN tapas !!!! 11$ pour UNE huître géante... Franchement !!! Vous délirez où quoi?!?!?!?! Vivre une expérience de nouveau restaurant ce n'est pas juste le goût qui compte mais l'expérience entière. Lorsque tu sors de là, si tu devient anxieux juste à penser au montant que tu viens de débourser, le reste de ton expérience culinaire est complètement gâché, car oui le goût y était mais tu pourras pu rien foutre pendant deux mois tellement c'est dispendieux alors tu deviens frustré!!"}
{"text":"I will never step foot in this restaurant again thanks to the pretentious douchebag of a dudebro who treated us like he didn't have time to deal with us when we walked in on a Friday night. Who is this guy? His bro chums who were standing around outside smoking got the special bro treatment when they came in, though.  I've eaten here for brunch once and had an overpriced sandwich, which was ok, but I thought I'd give it another shot on a weekend night.  When we went in and told the dudebro that we'd like to sit and have a drink at the bar (thinking we'd order a small dish to start off) he grunted at my manfriend, \"It's NOT a bar.\" REALLY? You know, considering the fact that I live nearby and listen to their noisy customers out howling drunkenly on the street many a summer night, it seems ludicrous to slap me with that attitude. Pissing your neighbours off, particularly when you're a restaurant with a bar, in a residential neighbourhood, is probably not a good idea."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! Dry aged veal. Homemade pasta. Soft serve sorbet. Simple, yet elegant. This is truly a Montreal Gem."}
{"text":"Great vibe! Excellent waitress very helpful with menue selections. In town for business a few days and definitely off the \"tourist track.\" Went there on a Yelp review. Whole baked walleye was magnificent. Great local wines. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really different & fun place!  Menu changes often.  Menu is on a board  so I took a photo.  That's your best bet.  Staff friendly & helpful."}
{"text":"Maison Publique is a nice place that is worth a visit.  As soon as I arrived, I figured I had cracked the code on why this place (and places like it) find there way on En Route's top 10.  Regardless of other factors, the food and layout of the restaurant are unique enough to make a contribution to the restaurant scene. Often, like Maison Publique, the location is just slightly enough off the beaten path to render it a \"find\". Sometimes En Route restaurants achieve these aims, while failing to please with a complete package of food and service. Maison Publique does better than most.  The layout here is classic pub. The ceilings add to the feel that you are in a neighbourhood joint somewhere in Britain.  The food is meant to be shared by those at the table. Some dishes (such as the Welsh \"Rarebit\") were unique, but not to my liking. The beef cheek salad was also creative, but short of delicious.  The albacore tuna cru was a tasty tuna app that could easily be shared or reserved for one person. The highlight of the meal was the 65$ steak delmonico which was a large portion that could be a meal for two people by itself. The flavouring on the steak was perfect.  Service here is good. They have a nice bar area with ample beer, wine, and cocktail selections."}
{"text":"I ended up in this lovely establishment as it was situated exactly between two places my friends were staying at for a weekend in Montreal. We knew nothing about the Jamie Oliver connection 'til we got there. it's found right in the Plateau in a super residential area, just a hop skip and jump from Mont Royal Ave and around the corner from Papineau.  My friend and I arrived early so we quickly order coffee and split a biscuit. First of all the coffee was awesome - they use 49th parallel beans and the biscuit was divine. Crispy on the outside and flaky and buttery on the outside. The bit that made it beyond the beyond amazing was the jam - rhubarb/strawberry. I understand it's pretty Quebecois and let me tell you pretty freaking delicious.   A traditional bruncher, I went for pancakes and bacon. For 13 bucks you a get a stack of three pancakes and bacon. No maple syrup needed as it was already drizzled for you perfectly. Super filling brekkie as we were on our way to Osheaga and festival food, that said I didn't even finish my last pancake as I was pretty full from the biscuit. My two other friends got the same and loved them too and our other went even more traditional and went for bacon and eggs - also a winner.  My only regret was not going for an early morning cocktail - they all looked delicious! I'll definitely be making my way back when I'm in the 514."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch at the request of a friend. I know the reviews say it can be really good or ok, but I was told it all depends on the crowd. We came here for brunch on a Saturday and it was hands down one of the best brunches I have had.   Let's start with the coffee. I've never felt such a lovely jolt from coffee. It was served in a lovely Montreal mug.   There was 5 of us who decided to share several dishes. The menu changes regularly, but we got 7 dishes to share and there was not a dish that I'm not still dreaming about several hours and two meals later.   My favorite was the pancakes and BLT. I know what your thinking. That's pretty normal bfast food. But, don't be fooled. I don't like sweet foods in the morning, but I was not sure how I could stop eating the pancakes and was a little annoyed I had to share this with others at the table. They were buttery and melted in your mouth. Also they were topped with bacon...mmmmm! The BLT was a delicious beefsteak tomato sliced and sandwiched between the layers was bacon and basil. The dish was then covered in a cream sauce.   I will come back here next time I come to Montreal. I might even drive back just for this food:)"}
{"text":"Really lovely friend date here this weekend!! We rolled up on our bikes around 8:30pm to this warm glowing little gem on a leafy Plateau street without reservations. We waited about 10 minutes while they sorted us out and we were cozy inside by the big open window in no time. Our waiter was kind of abrupt at first but he warmed up as the night progress and in the end we really loved him, and his wine recommendations! We managed to eat 4 very delicious vegetarian dishes here, which can be tough in these terroir oriented places, and all were super delicious and innovative. Damage for 4 dishes and 4 glasses of wine was $60 each including tax, which is fairly standard for this type of place these days in Montreal.   In all, it was a beautiful cozy room and a kind and delicious experience, definitely a place to come back to."}
{"text":"Il y a quelques années, nous allions régulièrement à ce restaurant pour le brunch. Nous aimions beaucoup l'endroit, mais les standards ont baissé il y a un an ou deux, donc nous avons cessé d'y aller. Nous leur avons donné une autre chance ce week-end et avons été très déçus. Le service était franchement un des pires que j'ai eu. Le serveur nous criait les informations (alors que personne d'autre ne criait dans le restaurant) et il était très bête. Apres 45 minutes à attendre nos 3 plats, on a demandé s'ils arriveraient bientôt. Il nous a répondu bêtement qu'il ne savait pas, sans même s'excuser. Il a desservi nos assiettes contenant encore de la nourriture sans nous demander si nous avions fini. Pour ce qui est de la cuisine, c'est moins bon qu'avant. Les bénédictines et les huevos rancheros étaient bons, mais on les a reçus tièdes. Le plat d'uf et saucisse laissait à désirer, la saucisse n'ayant presque pas été colorée avant d'être servie. Et l'assiette de pommes de terre était beaucoup trop salée. Bref, nous ne reviendrons pas."}
{"text":"Service très sympathique, produits locaux, ambiance taverne moderne, clientèle hipster. Les items au menu ont des noms ésotériques qui demandent explications. Est-ce suffisant pour justifier qu'un sandwich oeuf-fromage-saucisse sur muffin anglais (style McMuffin) tout seul dans son assiette coûte 14 $? Et le café (3$, à volonté) n'est pas inclus. C'est peut-être un prix normal pour un petit-déjeuner à Londres, mais abusif à Montréal."}
{"text":"OMG, I don't understand why this place has only 3.5 stars. I ate at Joe Beef 2wks ago, and this restaurant rivaled that. At 1/2 the cost!. A lot of the dishes are game (rabbit, deer, etc), so expect rich. My partner and I ordered 3 apps, dessert and 2 beers for $85CA. The food was phenomenal, really. Service is more like you'd expect from a sports bar, but that tiny kitchen is super passionate and it totally shows. I stopped in on a whim and will definitively go back (which I don't do often in Montreal). UNDERRATED ON YELP."}
{"text":"We went there for brunch on a Sunday. My first impressions were very positive. The decor is wonderful and a lot of effort is put into making the place feel cozy and familiar. Everything on the menu sounds delicious and reminds of good old homemade cooking.  It might be worth noting that there are no menus. Instead, everything is written on a chalkboard near the counter. It might be neat if you happen to be seated nearby, but we were in another room, so we had to go stand in the aisle between other tables while making our choice. Not the end of the world obviously, but not the most practical.   Our service was average at best. We had to wait over 30 minutes for our orders. And by the time the 5 of us received their food, some had long finished.   It was delicious, but very expensive. Oh and did I mention this place was extremely hipster? Because it is. A lot. But I guess it fits the location."}
{"text":"I stopped Yelping for no reason in particular but I feel obligated to drop Maison Publique a review because 3.5 stars is simply wrong.   I came alone on a Sunday night and though I had a reservation, walk-ins were possible both at the bar and for tables(I saw a table of 4 walk in and be seated immediately.   A girl who was also visiting from New York came in and sat next to me and she seemed sane enough so I asked if she wanted to spit our meal so we could try more things and she happily agreed.   We ordered the Lamb Tartare, Asparagus, Crab Tart and the Tagliatelle with the deconstructed rhubarb pie for dessert(not what it was called but essentially what it was).   Everything was truly great. I don't remember a meal I've enjoyed this much in such a long time. Prices were more than reasonable and we ended up spending $140 CAD total with two drinks each included.   I don't think this place is hurting because it clearly receives attention from all over the country but this Yelp rating could not be further off. I'm an American and was sitting with another American and the service could not have been better. Go."}
{"text":"First time for us. I only wish I lived in Montreal so I could dine here more often. We were a party of two for dinner. At first I was disappointed that they were seating us at the bar but that turned out to be the best seats in the house. We had a bird's eye view into the kitchen and we had Jack to guide us through the evening. Jack patiently walked us through each dish all the while asking us questions about our taste preferences. We had 5 plates to share each was more delicious than the previous dish. So stop reading and make a reservation."}
{"text":"So sad to say my first time in Montreal and I had to experience legitimate discrimination for being American. I was told that there were no tables in a visibly empty restaurant. I take Yelp very seriously and this is no joke. I am disgusted."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and check this place out. In town for Grand Prix weekend and my group of 4 old friends wanted a quiet post race dinner after a weekend of louder fun...One of the group had tried Maison before and recommended it. It was a longish cab ride out from city center, but wow...very cool little bar/restaurant, quaint decor, very friendly staff and the food was fantastic. We tried several small plates to share and then had spicy ribs, which were one of the specials. We did a couple of desserts, several beers and/or cocktails each and got out for like $80 each. This is an awesome spot."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place!  From the laid back tavern like ambiance to the deliciously prepared food and amazing discovery of Canadian wines, this place is as solid as it gets!   We were lucky enough to sit at the bar and have a view of the kitchen as the line cooks expertly dished out each plate with TLC. Our waiter happened also to be the bar man and expertly picked out a wine that fitted our tastes. Their wines are mostly Canadian which had me very hesitant at first since what kind of wine could be possibly produce with our cold climate?! But a real surprise as a gamay from Ontario delivered across the board!     The menu changes quite frequently but given that it was our first visit we opted for the timeless items.   We started with the parfait of foie gras, served with pickles and their house bread. Delicious! The texture was beautiful and packed a punch of garlic flavour that only complimented the taste of foie gras.  We continued with the maiale tonnato which was a house made pork charcuterie slathered with a Dijon mayo sauce and topped with shaved parmesan. I'm not a huge fan of cold cuts but was pleasantly surprised. Not too salty as charcuterie can tend to be and the fatty part of the meat wasn't too greasy tasting either.   We continued with the cappallacci à l'ortie stuffed with ricotta. Divine! Best pasta dish I've had since Italy! Cooked al dente, the ortie adding a bit of freshness and the ricotta was just perfectly grainy in texture. Drizzled in a bit of olive oil, I would have eaten 20 of them!  We also tried the fried rabbit. First time eating rabbit for me and I was quite surprised at how light the meat tasted. It was covered in a very light batter and served as a very generous portion size. For fried chicken lovers out there, you gotta try this dish!  Finally we ended with the Meyer lemon tart. Thin crust, nice consistency to the filling. Meyer lemons are not as tangly as a regular lemon and this tart highlighted that we'll both in its brightness and sweetness.   Overall, I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. Will definitely be going back to try everything else on their menu as well as brunch!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. If i can give a restaurant zero stars, I would.   The menu is confusing and the staff are not helpful. Upon asking more than once (we were a group of 8 and not one of us understood the menu), the answers we were given were vague and not helpful. We were unaware that the plate you chose had NOTHING else on it but what you ordered. For example: you ordered the pork chop, you got a giant pork chop. When I mean giant, I mean it's the size of a Flinstone piece of meat... but be aware that it's tough, fatty and either came over-cooked or raw. Then there was the tuna \"plate\". Keep in mind you ONLY get the tuna on your plate ... and it was the size of 3-4 sashimi slices. I'm italian; I gotta eat!! Was this an amuse-bouche? NOPE!! that was my meal. Thank god there was Mac and Cheese in my cupboard at home!!! I was utterly disappointed and the staff didn't seem to care to hear how disappointed we were. Considering that it'll cost you about 150$+ for two people (not including wine) I would really recommend taking that cash and going to Pinxto or Quartier General.   The only good part about the whole night was that I was in good company."}
{"text":"You can definitely expect a wait here, especially on the weekends. So, either arrive early or plan to go with a small enough group. Their menu is small, but very well thought out and absolutely delicious. Also, they have a good drink menu for their meals too. I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"I've done breakfast a few times and dinner once and I do enjoy it here.  Food is always a new and fresh experience, and it manages to always surprise the taste buds in a very good way.  Atmosphere is awesome, service is great and I love the originality.   It's places like Maison Publique that makes Montreal different and unique. I'd best sum it up as commercial free!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing,  Derek is arguably the best chef in the city. The soft serve is awesome!"}
{"text":"This used to be my best favourite place in all of Montreal, I was gutted the last time we went, the whole staff has changed and so has the service and the food! End of visits, so disappointed - I cannot tell you........."}
{"text":"A must visit in Montreal - the menu changes frequently and the specials are always delicious."}
{"text":"Disappointment.  I went here from brunch with some good friends and high expectations - who wouldn't, give all the hype and big-names associated with this place?  The food wasn't too bad, but that's about all I can say. The servings were small - by any Montreal breakfast standards, let alone the prices they charged. I had the breakfast muffin which was tasty, but basically just a $15 Sausage-McMuffin.  The coffee was expensive, tasted terrible, and was served in small cups. My sometimes-alcoholic friend (birds of a feather...) ordered a cocktail, which even he struggled to finish.  The decore is OK, but hardly original. It looks just like Liverpool House and Joe Beef (which I can understand look the same, as they're run/owned by the same person and right next door to each other), to the point where there's even a picture of Joe Beef on the wall.  I have heard (both on Yelp and offline) that the brunch for two is good. I'm thinking about going back to try it, but I'm not in any rush."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  VIBE  Definitely hipster but without trying too hard. Oxymoron?  I got a drive here so I'm not sure on the directions but it's definitely a neighbourhood place (yay). At the same time, not sure how accessible by bus/metro it is. So better in summer than in winter? But in winter not as crowded? Regardless, I sat at the bar. It's great. Staff en pointe. It was ideal for one of those leisurely Saturdays.   WE ATE We were here for brunch and it was very chilled out for the time we came. I think it changes all the time but we had:  -Granola - hearty size - DC loved it.  -Lamb meatballs with hallah and a bit of cheese. Aw, man! So good. Sop up the sauce with the hallah.  -Fried potatoes with cheese, mayo and scallions. If I could I would have picked up the plate and just opened my mouth. One of those scrape the sauce off the plate with your hands type of dishes.  -Pork (belly) and beans. Yeahhh. It's not healthy but it's all soo good.  -Coffee is by Cafe Myriade. Solid.  It all cost about $60. So a bit pricey but we had a feast!   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Yeah, I like this maison. I'll be back late night next time but would also love to stroll around this lovely neighbourhood in the warmer months."}
{"text":"I live across from Maison Publique and have been coming here for years. Finally might as well leave a review, in which I simply want to express how great this place is. The food is ALWAYS quality, the atmosphere cozy and inviting, and the staff attentive - overall I think the restaurant nails it and I'll keep coming back as long as I'm around. The brunch has made this place famous in my 'hood, but there hasn't been a night I've been let down, after probably 30+ or so visits the last several years.   The food is local and they serve some of the best wine Canada produces."}
{"text":"Excellent service, dinner and brunch.  I like the vibe and feel of the place, and like the consistency of the service, and unpretentious attitude.  The food is for the most part very well prepared and creative - clearly the chef has a lot of passion.  There are some missteps.  A fish soup I ordered was extremely salty I think on account of the fish having been salted and then added to an already seasoned broth. I had this soup twice because theoretically it should have been phenomenal and was hoping the first time was a mistake but it was salty both times. Chard that had been sautéed with garlic and vinegar didn't allow the vinegar to reduce so the chard was extremely vinegary and almost inedible. And probably most egregiously - the food is almost always overpriced.  A child sized platter of tagliatelle and meatballs I could have done at home for a quarter of the price (and better flavour), though I suppose it's nice to have someone churn out the fresh pasta for you.   However - when the food is good it's incredible. Bluefin Tuna steak I ate recently was one of the best I have had. Lamb carpaccio was savoury and delicious. The butterscotch pot a creme dessert is possibly the most decadent and delicious dessert I've had in Montreal, and warrants a trip back just to eat it again.  I've only eaten brunch once, but I remember it being pretty darn delicious.   I am here every so often, and will continue to come. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"the shrimp toast was delicious, fresh, tangy with a touche of spice very umani. then we had the pork shoulder which was good but a bit small, the baked oyster is also great, it is all small quantities and pricy but i will be back for the flavour."}
{"text":"Vraiment? Un restaurant tant publicisé à cause de son association à Jamie Oliver et personne n'a encore écrit d'avis? J'y suis allée pour le brunch donc je dois avouer d'avoir goûté qu'à une petite partie du menu. Le service est bien courtois mais ça se voit que le resto est encore dans ces premières semaines. Certains petits détails, comme un seul pot de lait pour les cafés pour tous les gens au bar, devraient être revus ou améliorer. La bouffe comme telle, les MP muffins et les pancakes, étaient bonnes mais j'ai trouvé ça pas mal cher pour ce qu'on a eu et pas tant hors de l'ordinaire que ça. Le MP muffin, fait d'un muffin anglais, saucisse maison, fromage et un uf est bon, mais à 14$ pour un \"McMuffin maison\" c'est cher. Même chose pour les pancakes qui viennent avec le sirop d'érable déjà dans l'assiette, au lieu d'à côté pour vous permettre d'en mettre la quantité désirée. Puis le café, bien qu'il soit à volonté, à 3$ la tasse, encore une fois, c'est cher. Donc, pour un brunch juste sous les 20$ avant taxes et service pour un déjeuner (portion normale) et une café filtre, je trouve ça un peu trop cher en comparaison à ce qu'il y a ailleurs."}
{"text":"This place is a skip, hop and a jump down the street from my house, so to say that I had high hopes for this place would be a massive understatement. I walked in and was digging the ambiance: the bar was full of people, the decor was simple and the windows were all fogged up on a cold night: good start. The beer selection would have pleased some off-island, cars-up-on-blocks kind of people, but I made do and ordered myself a pint of something ghetto. The food, here is why I am only giving the place 2 stars. No pub that I have heard of does tapas so I was already a bit put off: you're either ghetto or high end, not both. Portions were small, we were charged for things and quantities that we did not order and everything tasted like half a salt shaker was used in it's preparation, shame, cause I really wanted to like this place.  I would however come back for a drink, but food, not until I hear they improve."}
{"text":"There has been much anticipation for Jamie Oliver's 1st foray into the Montreal food scene with Maison Publique, the English pub style joint run by Derek Dammann, his local partner, former sous-chef and formerly of DNA restaurant in Old Montreal. While I had hoped to first experience their dinner service earlier during their opening week, the timing didn't work out. However, I was able to visit for Brunch on their first open Sunday. I was very exciting to see what exactly Derek and co. had in store.  The restaurant is located in the heart of plateau Mont Royal in a relatively residential area. The bar dominates the decor and with good reason as it is absolutely beautiful. You also get a nice open view of the kitchen from both inside the restaurant (just outside of the frame to the left) and from the window outside the restaurant. The steady stream of alternative music added to a relaxed friendly and slightly hip vibe.  No menus are handed to you here - everything is posted on a board for all to see. Our waitress kindly informed us of this fact and mentioned the few items she had gotten to try... They'd only had one service previous to our visit, so quite understandable. The menu is a nice mix of classic brunch items with some twists, some typical English breakfast items and more eclectic fare. To start off, I ordered the apple strudel. Nice and flaky with a delicious apple filling, it was a good start to the meal.  Next up, I ordered the breakfast sandwich. A sausage patty covered with melted cheese, topped with a egg and maple syrup, all between the housemade English muffin. You are left with a very tasty and satisfying sandwich. The English muffin in particular was quite nice.  My sister, on the other hand. ordered the pancakes with pear butter and smoked bacon. Very nice and fluffy pancakes, all perfectly cooked. The pear butter was a nice and subtle touch to the dish and the bacon had a great smokiness as you would expect.  All in all, a very successful brunch and this was their first weekend. I only except things to get better and better. In general, good brunch places are hard to find so to see a new option enter the scene - especially in my neck of woods - is a wonderful thing. Everyone looking for a great brunch will be in for a great treat if they visit Maison Publique. I hope to have a review of their dinner options shortly - this experience has only made me more eager to come back for more.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went there with a group of friends ... we had the tasting menu ... without saying it was not good I was not impressed .... i still don't get how this place makes the list 100 best restaurant in Canada. I was served a beets Salad ... which that i could definitely say it did surprised me ..... it was original and very refreshing .!!!  The rest? Not so much. The worst part of the evening was the service .!!!   Rushed and inattentive."}
{"text":"First time here but will not be the last. Place was packed but plenty of space to eat comfortably in my little corner counter area. Loved the thick 1 inch toasts fresh and crisp. Sausage big and juicy and is well accompanied with crazy bacon end served with hp sauce. The kimchi is super hot and different to have with eggs. Enjoyed the plates with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia sceneries. Just a nice friendly place and the server was just great."}
