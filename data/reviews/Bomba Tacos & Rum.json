{"text":"Service was wonderful, food was excellent, and the price was spot on!! Me and my wife have found our new taco and guacamole hub!!! Good for you rocky river, good for you!!"}
{"text":"No chips for free. Their are great Mexican  restaurants in the area that give free salsa and chips like cozumel  Frustrating. Let's start with the waiting area,wait there wasn't one. People kept running into us why we where standing. Server was okay said like 15 minutes that she lost our order. So we had to reorder. Then we get our food it was like Luke warm. Then they messed up one order. Stiff was suppose to be on the side. They went to the back and scrapped it off and bought it back out. Portions are small with leave you hungry. Took forever to get our check.   So they just lost 6 customers for life"}
{"text":"I took my office to Bomba Taco's today for lunch.  First let me say that the food was very good.  Tasty with lots of flavor.  We did the Taco and salad Lunch Special and everyone walked away with full tummies.  Now the bad part.  We came in at 11:45 before the lunch rush.  Hardly anyone was there.  We were seated promptly and pretty much forgotten about.  It took our waitress over ten minutes to even recognize that we were sitting there.  Not good for a new restaurant who is trying to win over a lunch crowd.  Finally got to order some drinks and our food and then waited another 33 minutes before food arrived.  We are now 45 minutes into a one hour lunch period.  We ate and again the food was very good.  There is no way an average worker can go here during lunch and not get into trouble if they have to be back in one hour.  Good thing my people were with the boss.  I hope that they get the service turned around quickly or this place will be a short lived venture!  Good luck to them."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious food!  Holy moly!  Had a really great first experience at Bomba and can't wait to go back.  Everyone was really nice and knowledgable, great service!  Can't wait to return and try more tacos!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the concept of rum and tacos, good service and atmosphere. Started off with guacamole with jalapeños wihiich didn't taste any better than a store bought version.   Unfortunately the tacos were disappointing -- the chicken tinga was lacking any really punch and the lamb barbacoa was just not good, tasted like it had freezer burn than microwaved. Only bright spot was the blackened fish taco. I'll give them another try, just not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Tried them twice. First time, horrible service. It was even a very slow evening. We had to ask if we cold order drinks, and then ask if we could order food. Its as if we were such an inconvenience being customers at their bar. We tried a few bland tacos and plain guac. Had a couple drinks. Left unsatisfied to say the least. Second time, sat at bar table. Service was much better. In fact we loved our server, she was great. Food still just mediocre. Not a fan. I may give them ONE more shot. Prob no more after that. What a bummer."}
{"text":"Great Tacos they all had a little spice to them. Love the outdoor seating. Pretty good service."}
{"text":"Service was disappointing and tacos were bland.  Wasn't until we got the manager that we got our drinks refilled. Waited for 20 to 30 mins before our food order was taken. Tacos were bland, better off going to chipotle. I do have to say that the manager was very nice and knew what he was doing. Wait staff needs to take a lesson from him."}
{"text":"I met my fiancé, who had already been several times, for lunch here today. Our server was friendly, quick and attentive but not overbearing. The tacos are awesome; even the vegetarian tacos are super flavorful. The lunch special is a perfect portion for an even better price.   Im so excited to come for dinner and sample some of their rum, rhum and ron offerings!"}
{"text":"Fantastic establishment. The tacos are great and you can really taste the flavor in each bite. The guacamole is great as well. Added the spicy peppers to it which gave it the perfect bit of spice to each bite. The cocktails are A+.  A must if you're in the area and are craving some Latin food."}
{"text":"Bomba is good. When I was there, I had 2 tacos - 1 crispy shrimp and 1 chorizo. They were both delicious! We also had the guacamole. It was good, but not the best. But, I like the variety of chips they give you (I believe it was regular tortilla chips, plantains and something else?) The drinks are good but kind of small for the price.   The reason I didn't give Bomba more than 3 stars is the staff. A week before I ate there, I went in with a friend to be seated. I will add that it was busy -- Friday night around 6:30ish. But, the hostess looked at us like we were such an inconvenience to her. We ended up leaving and going elsewhere because of it. We did return the following week because we both heard good reviews and love tacos, this time a little earlier. We were seated right away. This time the waitress was pretty inattentive. Nothing that wouldn't make me return, but odd that we would have two separate experiences with rude staff.  Overall, I would recommend and return. They have a lot of variety, and I'd like to check out more on the menu."}
{"text":"BLAH BLAH BLAH, I took my mom here for lunch a little while back. I should of known when it took the server about 5 minutes to even come over. Everyone kept walking past us with no greetings. Seemed like we had a couple different servers the whole time. Order chips and salsa as an app-came out about 30 seconds before our tacos. Not a fan of the plantains with the chips and salsa I wish our server would of let us know that so we could just get chips cause we never saw her until it was time to pay. Someone else dropped the food off and by the time she came to check up on us we were already done eating our bland tacos. I love Barrio and wanted to try this place but I think I'll stick with Barrio."}
{"text":"If you don't like these tacos then you don't like tacos. Crispy shrimp tacos are the best. They are super accommodating. They made me vegan pancakes. Their drinks are the best. I try and go a minimum of once a week."}
{"text":"If the food was better then it would have been 5 stars.  Service was top notch, we told our server that we wanted to get in and out quick, and she made it happen, yet still frequented the table to be sure we were OK.  I had bigger expectations for the food, It was average, and this is a place I wont be in a rush to get back too."}
{"text":"Really, really good Cuban-style cuisine outside of Florida is hard to come by: to have access to it in a westside suburb of Cleveland is an unexpected treat.  Loved the dishes, which were Cuban-esque yet distinctive  (I'm thinking of a coconut infused rice), excellent service, and relaxed, colorful but non-cheesy decor.  The rum - flavored ice cream made for Bomba's by Mitchell's ice cream (across the street) was also a delightful plus.  The only disappointment was an extremely weak rum - based drink, which was a genuine bummer since the rum offerings are extensive (see rum bar immediately  upon entering).  Luckily, the generous food portions, great service & ice cream helped overshadow what was an otherwise serious glitch.   Hope they take note though since a lovely, unwatered-down rum drink  would've tied the entire experience up with a nice 5 star bow."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Bomba since they opened and I almost always get at least one braised beef taco.  I think it's the best thing on their menu.  So of course I was VERY disappointed when I found they recently took it (and several other favorites) off their menu!  Our server admitted that they removed \"a lot of the more popular items\" to make room for others.  When asked why, he said something about having \"too many meat choices\".  Excuse me?  What does that mean?  I tried a few of the replacements (no idea what they were) and they were merely OK. Not bad, but nothing special.    I hear their parent restaurant, Paladar, still has the braised beef tacos on their menu so I'll trek over to the east side to get my fix.  Bomba, consider me VERY disappointed."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner last weekend at it was amazing. The wait was was well worth it. They kept us informed at where we were at in line so we walked down the street to grab some Starbucks before we ate.  The guacamole and the margaritas are my favorite. And I love that the gauc doesn't just come with the regular tortilla chips but plantain chips too.  The atmosphere is great and I love the decor.  Overall we loved it and we will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"This place is all the great things you have heard. Went for the first time last night, Friday, at around 6:15 and the five of us were seated immediately at a hightop. There was a wait for a table or booth and soon after there was a line of about 6-8 groups at the door. Our server, Joey, was attentive and friendly as well as very busy. He took time to explain some preparation features of the restaurant,  answer our questions, and even made a few suggestions. I had the chicken tinga taco, the zucchini and black bean, and the blackned fish. All were very tasty with the chicken being my favorite. The fresh guac was also excellent, and I'm not a huge fan of guac! Their approach to preparation is a little different than say Barrio, which is also very good, here they use more fresh fruit, vegetables, and pickled slaw to bring out flavor. The spice was still there in certain areas but the slight differences were a nice change. I also had a few rum samples which were amazing because, well,  it was rum!! Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Tasty modern tacos with off the wall add-ins. As a chain restaurant it would not be my first choice for tacos in the Cleveland area, however, I did really enjoy my food! A few issues with service, particularly bill and change calculations but as a new restaurant, they could still be working out the kinks. Worth one visit at least. Vegan options are available which is a huge bonus!"}
{"text":"First, I'd like to say that I did not get a chance to experience the food, this has to do with the bar. I read another post here that stated their bar experience was terrible and the bartender seemed snobby. I had the same type of experience. There were only a few people at the bar when we came in. The one bartender helped us. I ordered a margarita, mango flavored. It was good. Then I asked about the rum. The other bartender pointed out that there were many rums. And walked away, did not try and explain or take the time to converse about it. It wasn't that busy in there, so we weren't taking up his time during a busy time. Then, I asked the bartender, the one wearing glasses, if I could get a mojito. He did not try to upsell me on rums. The mojito was filled half way up the glass with full mint leaves, not even ground up. It didn't taste as though there was any rum, just like a virgin strawberry mojito. The service we got was awful. I would not go into the bar again and I am now reluctant to order the mojito if I do go again. I was very disappointed as this was a place I had been wanting to try for a while."}
{"text":"Our first time a week ago. Pleasant surprise, sad we didn't try it sooner.  Food was fresh and light.  Our server said it was Latin American, leaning to Cubano.  Refreshing change from the gloppy Mexican restaurants like to serve here in CLE.  My only knock is the size of the tacos. Had fun experimenting with the rum flight, while the hubby ordered a tasty drink, celebrating the olympics with their national drink.  Top notch , helpful server who explained that yes, you can play around with the drink order, which I will do next time."}
{"text":"They have great tacos but a little expensive, but dessert was so good so im all smiles :-)"}
{"text":"Loved Bomba!  First time tonight and walked into a busy evening. Our server Brian was welcoming, friendly and fast. We went with his suggested favorites and loved every minute of it. We will be back next week for their great happy hour he told us about... and/or the Saturday /Sunday brunch that sounds amazing. Save room for dessert... The churros are the best we've ever had. Cheers,  Bomba."}
{"text":"I stand by my last review of the place and the management even acknowledge it in the comments stating they would sent a private message - still waiting for that.  Says a lot about the true customer service.  Was going to give it another try but this left a sour taste in my mouth now."}
{"text":"Tacos. Rum.  Pretty simple little spot in a cute area. Some people don't like the lack of personalization and the reluctance of the establishment to allow guests to order in a more a la carte manner, but I've never had anything but really great meals. There are plenty of options, so unless you're insanely finicky, you're going to find plenty of things to eat. I had plantains here once, and they changed my LIFE.   The drinks here are incredible, on top of everrrrything else. Simple and good, no other way to describe it."}
{"text":"I went to Bomba with a group of 11. When we arrived and told the hostess how many we had she acted as if we told her we had 20 people in our party.  She told us she didn't know when we would be seated.  After waiting an hour and a half we checked on the status of our table. We watched customers come and go while we still had no table.  Finally after two hours of waiting they had an 8 top open up (not sure why it took two hours for an 8 top to open) we all squeezed in and finally was able to get chairs for all of us.  I understand that they just opened but in the future there will be large groups and they need to learn how to accommodate.   Our problems did not stop there. We all were seated and ordered drinks, appetizers and our meal.  We received warm water in small cups.  It took 20 minutes for us all to receive our drinks and then about 30 minutes for us to receive chips and guacamole.  Not everyone's came out at the same time. The guacamole was warm with not a lot of flavor and I didn't care for the chips.  We finally received our tacos- they were average and nothing special.  My friends ordered the bacon wrapped jalapeños and the waitress never told them that they ran out of jalapeños.  We never received a refill on waters.  The manager tried to make up for everything by giving us dessert and shots. But the dessert wasn't even good.  I will return one more time to see if anything improves   My first impression, I would never return. The service was bad and the food was ok. It's worth a chance to try and hopefully you have a better experience."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Great atmosphere, servers and food, but I noticed since opening night the portion sizes have gotten really small!  The salad I got was half the size it was when I ordered it the first time and its 11$ (with no meat!) and the guac portions are sad.  Barrios has a much more reasonable portion size for their guac and free salsa. We also had to keep asking for more chips for the table because for some reason they gave us one basket for multiple people.  I might go to enjoy the surroundings and get a few drinks but I'm not paying for their food when I can go elsewhere and get bigger portions for cheaper."}
{"text":"Josephine is awesome!  Super friendly and super helpful!!!  Food, as always, was great!!!"}
{"text":"This place has decent food but poor customer service.  I'd think twice about going again"}
{"text":"Loved this place! If you like mojitos and interesting tacos, totally the place for you.  And don't forget the guac! Only neg, the \"chips\" with the guac, a little bit too funky even got me."}
{"text":"First time here and stoped in for lunch during the week. Started with the guacamole and we added chipotle honey--they have some great options to add. It was very fresh with a hint of the honey. It was a good portion with different dipping options. Great weekly lunch special for $10 there are 3 options with different combo of tacos, salad/soup and or sides. I had the crispy avocado, crispy shrimp and blackened fish tacos and the yucca fries. All were great but the blackened fish was my favorite. It was excellent quality fish seasoned perfectly. My husband had rio style chicken, blackened fish and carne asada. The blackened fish and carne asada were his favorite. The pomegranate ginger margarita I had was sooo good. They make their mixes in house and really makes a difference in how fresh it was. Service was great and the waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The tacos were flame warmed flour tortillas. Best thing ever. Thank you.  The tacos as a whole were not very good. The mix of flavors was odd and the aioli tasted like straight mayo on a pork taco. Not my thing.  The atmosphere and set up of Bomba was my style. Low lights, an open bar. Yes please.  Service from Sabina the bartender was perfect. She knew about the rum, recommended items from the menu in detail.   I will come back for the service, drinks, atmosphere, and possibly a second chance on the tacos."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite spot in Rocky River. It has a great, reasonably affordable menu with fresh ingredients. Personal favorite is the kale and corn taco, and the elote. They also have a great drink menu, have a  mojito! It has a great atmosphere, and is very versatile: i can bring my kids for an early dinner, grab a drink for happy hour, or even come for an awesome brunch (killer bloody maria's!). Love, love, love Bomba!"}
{"text":"Not sure why you wouldn't rate this place 5 stars. Feels authentic, great selection of food and booze, and I thought the prices were reasonable. The jerk chicken taco was excellent. Wasn't overcrowded on a Saturday night and has plenty of outdoor, open air, and indoor seating. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time over the weekend. Started with a couple of appetizers and they were delicious! I thought, it can only get better from here! It went downhill as soon as the tacos arrived.   \"Crispy\" avocado taco was not crispy at all. So greasy, the oil must not have been hot enough. I honestly didn't like any of the tacos I had (avocado, shrimp, duck).  The corn/flour tortilla is gross. It's like a flour tortilla but grosser. Also not a fan of the tray that they tacos are served on.   Was hoping for a new place to eat. Maybe I'll be back for appetizers, but I'm never going back to those tacos."}
{"text":"After hearing nothing but good reviews I finally made it to Bomba Tacos & Rum. I was not disappointed! I have now been there twice now, both times were for lunch which allowed me to take advantage of their lunch specials. Guacamole with goat cheese was ordered both times as a starter. The trio of chips served with the guac is really delicious and a nice change from traditional tortilla chips. Guacamole was followed by two tacos and a salad. I love the Ensalada Mixta - the sherry vinaigrette is the perfect dressing for this mix of greens and toppings. As for tacos I have had the Chicken Tinga, Chorizo & Potato, Charred Kale & Corn (personal favorite!) and Crispy Shrimp. It was difficult not to eat everything on my plate, but the portions allowed me to take a to-go box for later. I can't wait to go back and try the other options and also indulge with a Mojito!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed I was exited to be here but my food here was cold no flavor. Service was good and the bartender tony."}
{"text":"Let me start off with a disclaimer: if you have no food allergies or dietary restrictions, eat at Bomba. Eat at Bomba every dang day. It's freakin' delicious, honestly. But if you do have food allergies or dietary restrictions, beware.   I have Celiac disease and it sucks, so somewhere like Bomba seemed like a godsend. I mean, they mark the menu items that are NOT gluten free, rather than the other way around (and most restaurants won't even do that). I've eaten there so many times in the past year, I should own stock in the place. But their failure to train their employees, when they so clearly pride themselves on being a haven for the gluten-free crowd, has made it so that I cannot go back.   I had one issue a few months ago that I won't get into because they took care of it swiftly and wonderfully, so much so that I've been back ~10 times since that incident. But Friday I went there for happy hour, and what I experienced was inexcusable. I ordered the pastor pork taco and the soft shell crab taco, both on their seasonal menu and both devoid of that evil little \"NGF\" label. I ordered them both gluten free, specifically. The second the soft shell crab taco was set in front of me, I knew it was breaded. I saw the gluten radiating. My insides started to shrivel up, I swear. The bartender asked the manager, who was standing at the expo window, if it was GF, came back, and said, \"Well he said it can only be made breaded.\" So a taco that I ordered specifically to be made gluten free, that was not labeled Not Gluten Free on the menu, got past the server, the cooks, the food runner, AND the manager at the expo window with no one going, \"Oh hey, this taco can't be made gluten free!\" This is the second time this has happened to me, and the lack of training simply has no excuse.   To top it off, the bartender reluctantly asked if I wanted a different taco (she was beyond rude). I ordered the zucchini taco, and it was of course delicious. She told my fiancé he could have the crab taco to try if he liked. Then she charged us for both after lying and saying, \"Oh, before, I didn't have your mojito on there so the charge is a little more,\" AFTER she ran our card. And NO, it was NOT the mojito she added (we had double checked our check before we gave our card), it was the zucchini taco! Look, both tacos were eaten. I'm not gonna sit here and argue that I should be given a free taco because I got served something that is basically inedible to me; it was $2.50, I really don't care. But I got charged for something that I physically couldn't eat without even the slightest hint of an apology from this rude server, and the rest of the staff who clearly don't know what they're doing either.   Sorry, Bomba. Call me when you stop acting like you're safe for Celiacs or when you train your staff. Oh, and Kelly the bartender--a smile and an apology go a loooong way."}
{"text":"We had dinner and drinks here last night and were underwhelmed by our experience.  I couldn't taste any alcohol in the mojitos and the tacos were just ok.  Not terrible, but just nothing special.  I was excited to try their mojitos since they are a \"rum bar\" so I was very disappointed when it tasted like lime/mint sparkling water.  A $7.00 drink served in a rocks glass should have a little kick to it.  Also service was very slow.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Re visited today for lunch. Specialty drinks are much better than their traditional I felt. Had a jalapeño drink and a dark and stormy, both delish! The bartender Amanda was great again as well as Matt who were knowledgable with great enthusiasm. The GM came over and offered us free churros for visiting again so quickly which was a great gesture! We started with goat cheese guac with pickled jalapeños, highly recommend. They serve their guac with plantain chips, root veg chips and tortilla chips, which is unique and very cool! Ordered a lunch combo which was pick three tacos combined with adobo fries. Not a huge fan of skinny fries, so I wouldn't order a diff side in the future. Tacos are still lacking filling but good flavor. Look forward to trying some of their sandwiches and dinners in the future. Definitely will be back for the guac! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Service is always awesome. The servers know their stuff wether it be rum or the food menu. Crispy shrimp tacos are AWESOME! Cool interior and nice patio for nice days."}
{"text":"Guacamole is ok, nothing special, they do not serve regular chips, I order tacos, they had no flavor at all, my son had a quesadilla and rice, it was super plane( no flavor) the waitress was nice, the place is nice, but the food"}
{"text":"A lot of hype. Food was ok. Drinks were super expensive. Service was slows sorry Bomba but ya fell short for us. We are foodies and love new experiences. This place has the potential but just not there yet."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a fun menu.  I especially like the  zucchini & charred corn tacos.   The service is good and the ambiance is comfortable.  As for the drinks, they are over priced and very week.  Moreover, chips and salsa are not complimentary.  You have to order them and pay for them.  If the last two issues on my reveiw are corrected this reveiw will be amended to include at least one more star."}
{"text":"I had such a better experience at Bomba the second time I went. The waitress was really helpful with opinions and details and the presentation of the food was kicked up about 3 notches. I noticed that the aioli was sprinkled nicely on top of the fries and my tacos looked way more appetizing because they were nicely put together.   I got the char grilled corn and kale tacos which were delicious. My sister got to fried avocado taco and said it was good too. I tried the chicken and bacon sandwich which was pretty decent as well, I really liked the chimichurri and horseradish sauce as well as the ciabatta-like bread.    I wanted a margarita but I forgot my ID and she couldn't serve me without an ID--so make sure you don't leave that at home!!"}
{"text":"The service here is very laid back and it takes a while to get in and out. The guacamole is very good but the portion is very small. I like to ask for no corn chips so I get a basket of just the special chips they offer."}
{"text":"I ate at Bomba twice so far and loved it. I'm not a guacamola fan but theirs is really delicious. I could make a meal out of just that. I also had pork tacos and shrimp tacos that were not too spicy but had a small kick. Delicious. I also loved the upbeat and attentive servers. I'm looking forward to going again this month."}
{"text":"I visited on opening day.  Good musician was playing although he could not be heard except in the room he was playing in due to crowd.  Food is tasty but tacos were not filling.  I feel I could have eaten 7 of them and at $3 or 4 each, this could get expensive.  I tried several types and they just don't put enough filling in them.  If they added just slightly more to each taco it would have been very fulfilling.  Mojitos were spot on, well balanced and I liked the sugarcane stir, but way too much ice.  I probably only got 4-5 ounces of liquid in the glass due to all the ice.  Service was good and I can tell this place is well managed for an opening night crowd.  Just fill the tacos a little more and a little less ice in the mojitos and this place can be five stars."}
{"text":"I found the food here really good. The service here was good...almost. They mostly care about you paying. I went here once and I forgot my wallet. I ordered some extras but it wasn't ready so I said don't worry about it and forget about it. I left my phone there when I went home to get my wallet. But when I came back they had my food."}
{"text":"Went there on the second night and naturally it was busy. No problem we found a seat by the bar. The drinks were very tasty. We got an order of guacamole and some salsa. Love the idea of the vegetable chips, although they and the two dips were under seasoned. The tacos I ordered were great, especially the chorizo. All and all a very good experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places, from the atmosphere to the food and drinks! The only downfall sometimes is the wait because it is always so crowded! Good problem to have for them I guess!  Would recommend to everyone! Barrio doesn't come close!"}
{"text":"food is great, but went here on a Wednesday evening for dinner and service was pretty slow. We did have a large group (~8 people), but our waitress hardly checked in on us, and both the food and drinks took a very long time to arrive."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I gave this place two shots, one being the other night, and it just didn't get any better...  I want to first point out that the atmosphere/ambiance is trendy yet casual...almost makes you feel like you're on vacation. This is an establishment that Rocky River needed in order to spice it up a bit. Although our server seemed a bit inexperienced with menu specifics (it's all good, though), we were promptly served in the mist of a busy dining room.  Now, here's where it gets a bit more complicated. We first ordered guac that came with the chip mixture (tortilla, yucca, plantain). Although the guac and chips were delicious--the best part of the meal actually--the guac serving was pretty small for a hungry party of four. Wish we were told that they were small portions.  The rest of the food was, sadly, pretty awful. The taco selections (some $3, others $4) sounded interesting and unique on paper, but it just didn't...work. Two people ordered the chipotle mushroom taco and both commented that the mushrooms tasted \"off,\" nearly \"rotten.\" Perhaps the goat cheese did not mix well with the type of mushroom, but both couldn't finish their meals because this taco was off-putting. I had the zucchini and charred corn taco, which was pretty tasty, but not worth the money. I wished that they offered corn tortillas as opposed to flour; it could have helped the flavor. The rice side was too salty and was loaded with onions. No ice in the water. No sauce toppings for the tacos. Domestic beers were overpriced (Miller Light = $4.50). I'm sorry to unload, but I'm just being honest.  I hope that Bomba quickly improves. Rocky River needs a place like this, but the prices are unreasonable for the portions/quality of food. As of now, I will head to Barrio for their tacos. Not sure if third times a charm..."}
{"text":"Today was my second time here. I love the unique taco flavors and the price is right! The pomegranate ginger lemonade was delicious as well, with a surprising free first refill. Honestly, I like it much better than Barrio. The flavors have all been significantly better in my opinion. We went at 2pm on a Saturday so we were seated right away. Last time we went on a weeknight and also were seated right away. However, as a caution, it's packed on Friday and weekend nights."}
{"text":"I went there a couple months ago for lunch with my friend and it was great. So I wanted to get dinner with my husband. It was on Monday night around 9:30 and they were not busy at all. Our server's attitude was awful. She was really rude. I've never seen servers throw silverware and food. I've never seen servers show her/his anger or something (no smile at all) to their customers. Maybe she had a bad day...?  I wanted to give her tip zero. I ordered a bowl of Tuna Poke, I wish they put more tuna but it was tasty. My husband's tacos were also good.  Servers can ruin customers' time even they have good food."}
{"text":"OMG it was SOOOO GOOD!!! I love that they have goat cheese! My only thing is it's a little pricey considering you don't get any sides of rice with your tacos or chips or something, but taste wise it was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour - The margarita was awesome, as was the bartender.  I ordered plain Guacamole; it was just ok.  It lacked depth of flavor, tasted like mashed avocado by itself.  Why the Manager would hold a staff meeting at the bar is beyond me.  What should have been a relaxing happy hour ended up feeling unpleasant.  No thanks."}
{"text":"I was very excited to visit Bomba. I read the menu online and everything sounded amazing. I knew I was going to have a hard time only picking a few things to order.   The decor and style were perfectly adorable, I wanted to take it all home. Just sitting down I was already thinking about how I wanted to take friends here in the future. However, I can't say that the food held up to the expectations.   It was pretty busy, and our server was very timely. However, the food was full of mistakes and seemed as if they were hastily throw together. My friend ordered a taco that was supposed to come with potatoes and corn on it, yet it had neither. Just a bunch of kale. She is a kind person and didn't say anything, but did not enjoy that she only got 1/3 of the ingredients listed for the taco. Needless to say, just kale on a tortilla does not taste very great. I ordered the crispy fish taco, and while the fish and the sauce were tasty, they were on a giant bed of undressed jicama. All you got when biting into the taco was a giant mouthful of dry, plain jicama. The taco had mango on it as described, but they were tiny little shreds that added nothing to the dish. They might as well have left them off.   The margaritas were super tasty for the first few sips, but the rims were salted really sloppily and hastily. It seems that big chunks of salt fell into the bottom of the glass because all of the drinks were really salty. I'm usually cool about this because salt is delicious, but oh my god were these SALLLTYY. One friend had to send hers back and another took a sip and just sucked straight salt up her straw.    Overall, not a very good experience. I would not recommend Bomba to others based on the experience that I had."}
{"text":"I must say that I was underwhelmed by this restaurant, which was a disappointment. I am willing to give it another chance, go back and try some different stuff on the menu. I got the street corn, which had a slight kick to it, but overall was really good. I also got 2 tacos and split some salsa with my boyfriend. The service was good, and the tacos were stuffed less than I would have liked. You definitely can get away with ordering 3-4, or 2 + a side. I would like to go back for a happy hour because I hear the drinks are good. The restaurant has a lot of potential, so I am eager to go back and see if it has changed any since I went."}
{"text":"This has been my second time at Bomba, and really, the flavors still just aren't there. (The guacamole is great and fresh with big chunks of avocado, and the blood orange margarita is also delicious - though skimpy) - the tacos... I love tacos... LOVE... but Bomba's tacos just aren't doing it for me. I've tried the lamb barbacoa, the BBQ pork, the crispy fish and crispy shrimp, as well as the spicy shrimp and the chicken tinga. I don't taste the authenticity, they fall flat. There's no passion. (Yes, we're still talking about tacos.) If you ask me, it's just a fancy Taco Bell for all the Rocky River white bread afraid of real flavor. Or sweating when they eat."}
{"text":"So we have been loyal fans of Bomba. What a disappointment this last visit on 1/25 for lunch at a booth in the bar. Service... well even my mother in law had unkind words to say about the bartender, which never happens. The menu lost all the braised items, so everything we went there for is now no longer. The pride of Bomba not being your typical Mexican restaurant it gone. If you want ground beef tacos well they now have those. RIP Braised Beef and lamb tacos."}
{"text":"I finally made it here for happy hour and I am so glad I did! The service was awesome, the tacos were delicious and the drinks are a great price during happy hour!  Our server was awesome. She had so much personality and while having a few tables she was also taking orders for a huge party next to us (15+ people) and not once forgot about us. Bomba is also doing things right by having runners bring us our food and drinks when our waitress was busy.  The only downfall to this place is they don't offer free chips and salsa. It's kind of like not getting bread at a restaurant, we've become so accustomed to other restaurants having these items that we get a little bummed when we don't get them with our meals.  During my visit I ordered a Pomegranate Ginger Margarita and a glass of the Sauvignon Blanc. While the margarita was great it was more pomegranate than ginger. For the tacos I ordered Rio Style Chicken and the Crispy Shrimp (a recommendation from a friend I was with). The Crispy Shrimp was so good that I had to order another and I still think about how delicious that taco is!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. Ordered five different tacos between the two of us, a couple of chicken tortilla soup, and a mango salad.  The tacos were sweet potato, fried avocado, chicken, Carne Asada, and spicy shrimp. Everything was outstanding, very fresh in gradients, and Mucho tasty.   Best part about the afternoon, all the lunch combos are $9.95 each!  I could really learn to like this place!   Now, just need to come back and in the evening, and conquer the rum flights"}
{"text":"I came into Bomba on opening weekend around 3pm because I figured it would be super busy during peak hours. It was still busy but we got seated right away. The staff was welcoming and our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. I mean the place is so cute and eclectic - anyone that doesn't love the layout and decor is crazy in my mind. They have an addition that has full length doors that open for fresh air during nice weather and a smaller outside patio for summer months.   Now for the food- we split an order of their guac in which you can pick items to be added like goat cheese, corn, pickled onions etc. great touch to personalize and it tasted very good. We also split 6 tacos which they serve family style to encourage sharing. They have many to choose from with a lot of veggie options. Some were awesome and some were good. We didn't try any of the fun drinks unfortunately. I want to go back to try more of the menu and drinks. It will be a great addition to that area of a Rocky River for sure."}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience here on separate occasions... We ate here before a movie at Westwood with 2 hours to spare.. we ordered reasonably quick but the kitchen must have been backed up and our food took forever to come to us. We were getting impatient after waiting 45 minutes for our food(30 minutes before the start of the movie) so we told the waiter to box it up. It took another 20 minutes to box it up so we intended on eating it in the car on the way to movies and it turns out our whole order wasn't in the bag.. never again"}
{"text":"Bomba is a great restaurant! The tacos are absolutely delicious. I especially recommend the spicy shrimp one- if you're a fan of fish. There is only one major problem with Bomba, that is that fact that they don't accept reservations. Besides that I totally recommend Bomba!!"}
{"text":"Pricey, but I guess that's the atmosphere you're paying for. The tacos were really good! And the yucca fries are amazing! You don't get many though which was a little strange. Regardless a pretty good place to eat."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and the staff was nice.  I'd go back if friends wanted to meet there, but I thought they were skimpy on the taco, spicy shrimp had three shrimp that were nickle size and that was it.  The blackened fish taco had an itty bitty piece of fish that was smaller than my pinky."}
{"text":"Tacos are very good and great lunch special of 3 tacos and a side for $10.  Shrimp Tacos, Coconut Mango Rice and Yucca Fries are my favs.  Staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The food here is good but portions are skimpy and prices are a little high. I would save my money and go to Barrio in Lakewood instead."}
{"text":"My friend booked this place for 20 of us adults and 1 child for her rehearsal dinner on 05/24, with email/ph agreements with staff re which tacos/drinks etc would be served. Arrived at 6:32pm and told the previous party in the semi-private room wasn't done yet (no biggie). We were seated around 7 and given chips, and tacos came out at 8 (30 tacos for 21 people). My friend expressed her concern to the assistant mgr, who we could hear arguing back and cutting our friend off from across the room (it is our fault we got here too early, she has never had a single complaint, she doesn't see what she needs to do, the food was ready in 41min, etc). Just a bit tacky and not the way I was ever trained to handle customers/clients/people in any job. Assistant mgr told my friend that she would comp the chips, which my friend stated she did not order and should not be charged for. After staff took away our plates, they brought more tacos. My friend had to ask staff about dessert (churros) multiple times, before they came out around/after 9.  We later found out that the assistant manager took away the majority of the server's gratuity, which was the last thing anyone wanted (a side from passing out water and setting food on a side table, we had only one server for that many people, and she did a phenomenal job and kept things as smooth as possible). Unfortunate experience and sad that the assistant manager acted the way she did. Retraining to handle difficult situations and be present and not throw your staff under the bus may not be a bad idea."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Service was good, place was cute inside. A lot of the menu items were just too spicy for me. A mild option would be good."}
{"text":"I have been to Bomba about 10X since they opened, however this is the first review.  The reason for posting this is that I have a friend and they said they have become less than satisfied with it.  In all fairness, I kept this in my on my visit there today.  Overall conclusion was - meh, it was ok.  But considering it's for a place that should pride themselves on flavor, it really had very little.  I tied four different tacos - chorizo/potato, braised beef, chipotle ground beef and crispy shrimp.  The chorizo/potato taco was excellent and I would say the goat cheese on it give it a nice contrast of flavor.  My personal opinion of the other three - virtually tasteless - there was nothing going on with them.  I even remarked to my wife - Barrio blows the doors off them.  My wife had the guajillo chicken rice bowl - overall she was disappointed.  She found no plantains in there, she found no cilantro in there.  It was virtually seasoned chicken and a Spanish type of rice with a plain cabbage (termed cole slaw) on top.  Overall a weak, tasteless effort.  Mojitos were solid.  Service was good.  Either the quality has been going downhill a little bit or else the competition has upped their quality game.  I will go again sometime, but it may be quite a while!"}
{"text":"First time and can't wait to go back!  Had 3 different tacos: mushroom and goat cheese, black bean, and spicy shrimp.  Side of yuca fries.  Finished with the coconut flan.  Layers upon layer of flavor and outstanding service from John who is a great salesman and server!  What a find!"}
{"text":"Food was so good here! We ordered tacos, salsa and gaucamole, and desserts! Couldn't get enough.  Their plantain chips are sooo good and a perfect replacement of tortilla chips!"}
{"text":"Really good food/location/drinks.  I went for happy hour and enjoyed their guac and a mojito. Lively atmosphere and pretty busy, so plan to wait if you don't have a reservation. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is great. The variety of the food is extremely wide and is suitable for anyone. If your vegan, vegetarian, or just a full meat lover, it has something for everyone. They also have a huge selection of different tacos to choose from! Perfect. If you have a taste for a Hispanic meal with zest and a good spirit, take your friends they'll love you!"}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent margaritas! I have been there so many times and always want more! Great service too"}
{"text":"Server was very friendly and atmosphere/décor was neat.  Unfortunately the food was blah, across the board.  Guac w/ pickled jalapeno and bacon add-on's was under seasoned and was very chunky, with many bites being little more than a giant chunk of avocado.  However, the chips that came with them were an interesting assortment of tortilla, plantain, yucca, and taro, which was a nice change from the norm.  Chorizo empanadas were all bread with very little filling.  Chorizo was almost unrecognizable.   Ordered 4 different tacos and they all had their own individual issues.  Barbacoa lamb was INCREDIBLY gamey.  Like, barnyard gamey.  Like, we didn't remove the glands before we braised the shoulder gamey.  Not good.  The Duck in the Duck taco was unrecognizable.  Crispy shrimp was not bad, but lacked punch.  Pulled pork with mango was dry and bland.  Don't get me wrong, they were all edible, and OK, but they were nothing special.  To have Tacos as the namesake of the restaurant, these need to be the star.  They unfortunately fell flat.  On the flip side, the Havana Torta was very good.  That was the one item we got that I was completely happy with.  For sides, we got the kale and an order of the elote.  Kale was cooked perfectly, and very garlickly, which I loved.  Unfortunately it was also a salt bomb.  I was hoping for a charred Mexican street corn type of deal with the elote, but unfortunately again, it was just bland.    For dessert, we got a Mexican chocolate panna cotta type of deal that was done well.  Overall, the place has a very interesting menu, but the food needs to be fine tuned.  With a little tweaking/seasoning, it could be really good.  I'd go again but I would not rush back.  We did not drink but they do have a huge rum selection.  The place has potential."}
{"text":"well, i wasn't blown away. the best things i had were my beer and the guacamole (w/ jalapenos and corn added).  Danielle and i each got different tacos and each tried the others (well, she tried one of mine and i tried all of hers).  she had 3 tacos (zucchini and roasted corn, bbq pork and crunchy shrimp). I had 4 tacos (spicy shrimp, tinga chicken, rio style chicken and blackened fish). Danielle's bbq pork taco was awful. it was overly sweet and sorta tangy. it was a tamarind bbq sauce. maybe that's why we didn't like it. neither of us is familiar with tamarind. her other tacos were pretty good. i liked the taste of both quite a bit.  i wasn't so lucky. i disliked 2 of mine - both the chicken ones. i should have read the descriptions more closely as i didn't realize i was going to get a ton of cilantro on the tinga chicken taco. i hated it. the rio style chicken was slightly better w/ peanuts, poblano peppers, cilantro aoli and some sort of slaw. i managed to eat all of it while leaving half of the tinga chicken uneaten. the blackened fish taco was the best one i had. it was the first one i ate and that might be a factor as the others were all cold by the time i go to them. the blackened fish taco had a pickled onion and pineapple slaw which was just incredible. sadly the spicy shrimp taco was cold when i got to it last and i was full. i ate half of it before giving up and just eating the shrimp and jalapenos out of it.  we'll give it another try because we've been to Paladar Latin Kitchen - the sister restaurant - and enjoyed it. we have no doubt that the food is good and that what we ordered just didn't really suit us. also the service was great and we enjoyed sitting out on the patio in the nice weather.  NOTE: upon re-reading my review I feel bad. The tone of my review feels like I hated the place and I actually liked it. Of the 7 tacos we tried we disliked 2. The others were fine to outstanding. In fact, the blackened fish taco and the zucchini and charred corn were fantastic. I will personally race responsibility for not liking the Tinga chicken taco because I don't like cilantro and didn't notice it when reading the descriptions."}
{"text":"Bomba is so delicious! I am yet to have a bad experience here. The servers are all insanely friendly and very knowledgeable about their menu.    I actually last went to this location during brunch time. Their mimosas are only $3 and they have amazing flavors like pomegranate-ginger and grapefruit. I know I'll be returning for brunch soon!  I love Bombas' unique Taco creations. I love the Rio-Style Chicken taco. It is such an amazing flavor combination. Their Carne Asada Taco is another favorite of mine!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. South American, not Mexican only.  Lovely.   My wife and I love this place for us and our kids.  The food is spectacular.  I recommend this for any meal, any occasion.   The rum flights are worth the cost. The margaritas are wonderful."}
{"text":"Food was below average at best. Cold tacos ? How is this possible? Only good taco- blackened fish."}
{"text":"After many people told us that they loved Bomba, we finally tried it out.  Well, I guess it is good to have tried it so we won't wonder about it anymore.  We were very disappointed.  It seems that you are not allowed to make any changes to what Bomba has created.  For example, we wanted either a side of queso or queso on the chips, but that was not an option.  We got chips with salsa which was fine.  The salt was inconsistently applied, and the salsa was a little bland.  The menu and the server tell you that 3-4 tacos are needed to fill you up.  Two, if they tasted adequate, would be plenty.  My husband order chorizo & potato, Rio Style Chicken, and Braised Beef.  The only one that he thought was alright was Chorizo & Potato.  The others bland.  I got the Chipotle Mushroom, Spicy Cauliflower Taco, and Blackened Fish.  I liked the Blackened Fish other than the pool of liquid that came streaming out of it.  The Mushroom taco was so bland that I don't know how they could have ruined a mushroom.  I love cauliflower, but Bomba found a way to make me really dislike the Spicy Cauliflower taco.  The level of spice was fine, but the flavor was just weird.  The server was a little intrusive, but otherwise she was ok.  The atmosphere was nice, but the booth was uncomfortable to sit in.  It troubled me that I overheard people at another table trying to order a taco with chicken, cheese, and salsa.  After some discussion/pushback from the server, the customer received the tacos as requested, but the cheese and salsa were in separate containers.  There was so little cheese that she needed to request more.  While I understand that a chef may have a point of view of flavor profiles, I find it troubling that there is little bend on prescribed menu options."}
{"text":"Love this place! When we sat down at the bar, the bar tender actually introduced himself and shook my hand, who does that nowadays? Just very personal service, great atmosphere, and even better food. One of my favorite restaurants by far. Will be going back again and again!"}
{"text":"Delicious make-your-own guacamole (you pick what you want and they make it) served with yummy plantain chips!!  We like mango, goat cheese and pepitas. Empanadas are delish, just tried the cubano- also fab. El Pastor is a great taco. Made the mistake of getting churros last time--mistake because it will be hard NOT to order these decadent warm cinnamon sugary treats every time we go in the future!! This is definitely a hot spot in River - expect a wait especially on Friday/Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!!!! Our server Lisa was so engaging and efficient. Can't wait until the weather warms up and the garage doors open wide."}
{"text":"I gave it 4 stars for the 4 tacos that I tried on my first visit.  The tacos tasted excellent. I also had a flight of rum... I would give that 2 stars.  The overall bill... I went with 2 other people and lets just say we could have gotten 200 tacos at Taco Bell and several bottles of my favorite wine for the same price of bombas.  I also didn't like the fact that I had to buy salsa to get chips.  Will I go back?  Probably, but this time, no alcohol."}
{"text":"Food was good when I tried it last week.  Tried to bring a group of 25 to the restaurant just before midnight for my birthday tonight and we were turned away saying last call was over. We had originally tried to plan the party there  but were told they aren't ready for private parties.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok, ok....decided to try Bomba again.... great decision! We had the sweetest server - I believe her name was Alex. She took care of us in a way that made up for the last visit. We came during happy hour and was greeted by a generous portion of guac. I ordered a mojito and my oh my was it refreshing! I especially like the sugarcane addition to it. The tacos we ordered were very tasty. The amount of flavor was just right -- not one flavor too overpowering. I feel that Bomba has gained an established foundation and will be a great place for years to come."}
{"text":"Only 5 stars bc there's no 6th. Best Cubano I've ever had,  the call it the Havana. Tacos are perfect,  tostones are tender and fresh. Rum cocktails are strong and delicious. Have to stop typing and order another drink or u would say more"}
{"text":"Went after being recommended by a friend. Had the Havana tortas which was very good, although a little small.  I tried 3 tacos with it, they were OK I guess but I wouldn't categorize them as authentic Mexican by any means.  A few of them had very runny sauces which was messy and made them soggy.  Paladar is better at Eaton. Dinner for 2 with 2 drinks was over $50, a bit pricey for the type of food."}
{"text":"Great margaritas, unique taco offerings, great options for sides. Various vegetarian options that are anything but ordinary, which is a big plus. Yucca fries rock my world every time I come!"}
{"text":"Had a solid meal Monday night. A couple $3 tacos along w their lamb meatballs alongside a fancy pants drink. Girlfriend ordered a couple tacos along w Brazilian cheese bread. They have a $5 menu on  select food/drinks JUST for the olympics too so check it out. Service also A+"}
{"text":"So, I've been here twice, once during their opening, and then again for a birthday celebration.   I wasn't sure about the concept of tacos and rum, but I have to say, these folks do a nice job.   Besides a PRODIGIOUS number of rums and drinks made from same, they have a lot of South American fusion stuff, and about 30(?) taco combos ranging from fish and shrimp, to chicken and steak, and they're all garnished to perfection with an array of sauces. They also have plantain an other South American treats made to order. Getting 3 tacos (ranging from about 3-4 dollars each,) was a treat and the bill wasn't too bad.  It tends to get a bit loud, but it's a fun atmosphere and the wait staff was on the ball, and hitting said ball out of the park with their help.  For anything from a first date to an anniversary dinner, I'd check out Bomba for fine drinks, fine food and fine company...  (And did I mention, I think their food's the Bomb...ba?)"}
{"text":"I hate how this place is the latest craze around town. I moved here from Arizona a month ago and heard nothing but good things about this place.... it is all anyone is talking about. OK, this place makes me laugh because I overheard a lady saying she prefers \"American\" tacos as opposed to this place. Let me tell you, there was nothing \"authentic\" about this place. The bland, thick, flour tortillas, get soaked and rip and the fish was nasty and overcooked, no flavor! You cannot add pineapple and cabbage to everything and consider it an amazing taco. The meat was dry, tortillas are sick, and the queso was a load of cheap, cheese (loaded with oil) melted down.... the only thing I enjoyed was the margaritas because they were actually delicious combinations, but man... those tortillas... can't get that flour taste outta my mind!"}
{"text":"To start with, the Hostess kept her cool with an obnoxious guest, which in my book is awesome because what was happening was well beyond her control and he was being an ass! The Cilantro Tequila Cooler is awful. Way to sweet. The build your own guacamole was really good pared with a variety of chips. Hubby and I each got 3 different tacos to share. Each was equally delicious. The special for the evening was sold out which was a huge disappointment. Other than that our food was delicious and we each had a bit to take home. Will come back!  P.S. This review was from 3 months ago. Wrote it and forgot to post it! Yikes."}
{"text":"Yay brunch with (affordable) bottomless mimosas!!! And they come in multiple flavors; original, pomegranate-ginger, strawberry, and grapefruit.  The guac with fancy chips and scrambled egg and chorizo soft tacos were good too.  Was here on a nice day (in Feb!) where they could open their garage door walls which added to the fun atmosphere of the place."}
{"text":"What a fun place! We got there in time for happy hour. I tried a traditional mojito and margarita (yum! They make their own mix so it doesn't taste all sweet and sour and fake). I will definitely get the margarita again. The mojito was alright. My friends enjoyed their pomegranate and ginger mojitos as well as the white sangria. We shared a guacamole appetizer with goat cheese and bacon--sounds gross, but Tim, our server, assured us it was delish and he was right. All the plantains and yucca and Manteca to dip it in were a nice change to the traditional corn chip which also came with it. We had the quest fundido as well; this was enjoyed by the table, but not my fave. I like things a little more flavorful.  For dinner, Tim recommended the tacos and shared his favorites with us. I tried the blackened fish (so good and my favorite of the two) and the crispy fish. The latter came out cold and I informed the manager and she replaced it AND took it off the menu. She also suggested some dips for one of my friends that she really liked. The manager also bought two desserts for our table as an apology which she didn't have to do, but was a great service booster. We had the coconut flan which tasted like creme brûlée and the churros (another Tim recommendation that was right on).  The atmosphere was bustling and fun. I would definitely go back. There are many seating arrangements to choose from so you can have many different dining experiences within the restaurant. I look forward to the next time and taking some new friends to introduce them to Bomba. A friend had the crispy shrimp as one of her tacos and said next time she'd get all three of them as that because it was so good."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere! The Dark & Stormy is one of my favorite drinks! The spicy shrimp bowl was delicious (and hot&spicy). I added mango and goat cheese to the guacamole- excellent! They have a small patio and a separate area where the garage doors open. Everything was clean and the server was very helpful in recommending drinks & apps. I will go back - probably on a Tuesday cause I saw that kids eat free on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Interesting menu and taco combinations. Not the best I've ever had, but the portion sizes are generous and the food is different. I ordered the lunch combo for $9.99 (or maybe $9.95, I can't remember) and got to choose three tacos plus a side. I thought this was a very reasonable price seeing as some of their tacos are $5 each. My favorite of the three was the classic chicken taco, which was a recommendation from our waitress. I chose the adobo fries as my side. I love fries, but I only ate a few of these and stopped. I suppose fries at a taco place probably aren't the correct choice. A fellow diner got the black bean side and said that was delicious. Diners in my group ordered the pineapple margarita and watermelon basil mojito, both of which they said were delish. If you can't make it for their lunch specials, they have discounted prices also from 2-5pm (I believe this is the correct time) that includes tacos, sides, and drinks. I won't be rushing back here for the food, but the atmosphere was nice and the outdoor-ish seating looked great."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent!  Bartender Tony is fantastic and knowledgeable - makes great drinks!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I recommend this place to everyone! BOMBASTIC! The rum flights are delicious and very educational. The tacos are fantastic. I recommend getting the tostones with pork. It was orgasmic. I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Went in yesterday. The food was amazing, but the service was even better. Jasmine provided the best service I have ever had. Even if the food was only mediocre I would come back just for her service."}
{"text":"Ubereats delivered well. Guy was on time and the order was correct. The food varies. The crispy shrimp tacos, cheese dip ( small but good) and guac are good. The chicken taco, both the regular traditional one and the rio chicken taco aren't good. It's dark and grizzly chicken meat and very little amt. Like low quality fast-food type chicken.  Havent been to Chipotle in a while but their chicken from my rwcollection is better .That's disappointing.  I would get the shrimp again and chips and queso but nothing beyond that. Fyi the queso dip is good but an incredibly small portion compared to what they give for guac and salsa mango. See pics."}
{"text":"Went to Bomba twice since they opened.   Decor is spacious and airy. They have an outdoor seating area and an indoor seating area that is semi-outdoor which casts a wonderful breeze into the bar area on a (rare) nice Cleveland day.   On both occasions the service was slow in between getting a second drink, ordering meals, getting waters re-filled and cashing out. But, Bomba is still relatively new, and quite packed at times. However, the service is friendly and extremely knowledgeable when it comes to the rum. My boyfriend and I got quite the lesson, which we enjoyed.    I was not extremely blown away by the food. The first night I went I ordered a variety of tacos. They were decent, but nothing to write home about, and if I'm in the mood for tacos I will go to a different place and to be fair I will not mention the place on this review. Then, on the second night I got a brisket sandwich. It was delicious, but I wish it had something on the side to accompany it for the price and size of the sandwich its self, which was relatively small.   The happy hour is wonderful. I had a mango-cilantro virgin mojito which was so refreshing and yummy. My boyfriend ordered the rum samplers  (flights) which come with three samples (essentially three shots) of various rum accompanied by cards to describe the rums name, where it was produced, the notes, and a fun fact. He ordered the spiced flight, and the premium aged flight. His favorite was the Diplomatico rum. I loved the Kraken spiced rum."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out (finally)! It is literally less than a half mile away. I'm late to the party.  We hit happy hour, and tried the empanada bites, and tacos. We also had margaritas.   The food was full of flavor, and there was plenty of it. No one at the table walked away hungry.  Margaritas were pretty good. They seemed a tad sweeter than I like, but I still enjoyed mine.  Nice casual ambiance. Our server was a very helpful young lady with lots of patience while we made up our minds.  We very much enjoyed our experience, and will return soon. I'm sorry I waited so long to try it.  Edit 12/16/17- after this review, someone reached out to me to try to get me to increase my rating.   I'll be candid...I won't update for a few reasons.  1. This is a chain.  2. Even during \"happy hour\" our bill was pretty large.  3. While it is a fun place, there are a ton of better options for food drinks and tacos all over Cleveland. 4. This is a chain. 5. I simply will not allow someone who doesn't identify themselves in a message to try to guilt me into a better rating. That is skeevy. If it was a Bomba employee, that is beyond a terrible business practice. If it was not employee...get a life."}
{"text":"Beef ropa and black bean soup. Both amazing. Had to add salt to soup and my garnish was brown and dying.  Guacamole added bacon and goat cheese! Delicious!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night and I loved it!  The drinks were great, the food was amazing and we didn't spend our whole paycheck!   I drank mojitos, which are usually too syrupy and sweet but these were perfect.  My husband got their version of a Cuba Libre - the BOMBA Libre.  I don't even like Coke and I thought it was delicious.  The food was equally as good - everything from the guac to the tacos to the yuca fries were on point.  My husband has an allergy, which is usually an issue but the waiter said 'just order what you want and we'll modify it to work.'  That is a rarity.  Usually we just get shoulder shrugs and bland suggestions (it's just dairy people!).   You know what else?  The staff is also really great.  It was a busy Friday night but the bartender still actually took the time to ask our names and talk with us and he even shook our hand.  The waiter was just as friendly.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I go to BOMBA at least once a month and have never had a bad experience. I  usually sit at the bar where staff is always welcoming. Natalie is an asset to Bomba! If you are a mojito enthusiast, Bomba is the place. All speciality mojitos are a combination of a fruit or vegetable and an herb. Pours are pretty generous.  I love the guacamole that comes with three varieties of chips. Spicey black bean dip is a must.   My favorite tacos are shrimp and also the fried avocado. I would also recommend their rice bowls!"}
{"text":"Well, I went two days in a row so I should just say \"enough said.\" But I will go ahead and support the 5 stars better than that. On the grand opening day I went for happy hour and followed it up with lunch the next day. During those two visits we had bacon wrapped jalapeños (spectacular though one of the pricier snacks), guacamole with bacon, mango, and goat cheese (best guacamole I have had anywhere in the history of guacamole), and 6 tacos (blackened fish, chicken tinga, crispy avocado, brisket, pork something, and another beef something). The tacos were all very flavorful and fresh, each with a seperate unique flavor. The chicken tinga was perfectly spiced, the avocado was unique but awesome, and the blackened fish was the hands down favorite. During happy hour we indulged in some well balanced mojitos and a rum flight (note: the rum flight is $5 OFF it doesn't COST $5 much to the suprise of my dining partner. Oops!  :) But the rum flight was a fun way to compare the different flavors.  Service was dang good. Opening week/month for most restaurants are a bit discombobulated. But not the case here. It seemed pretty flawless. Amanda the bartender (or was her name Angela?? Too much rum that day, so I can't trust my memory) was friendly, helpful, and fun. We sat at a table for lunch the next day and the server (Lisa) was also spot on. Ian (a manager, I assume) came by to check on us and was also very welcoming.  The atmosphere has a cool vibe. I even love how they made the outside cute and standout since it is just in an otherwise plain strip mall.  I cannot wait to dine on the patio and sip on some rum drinks once the weather holds. I have a feeling I know where I will be spending many summer days."}
{"text":"Service was pretty good. Not over bearing. Food lacked flavor in a lot of areas. It wasn't awful but it didn't make me want to go back."}
{"text":"Our first time here,loved the unique chips.  Plantain, corn, all so delicious.  I got the chicken taco, hubby got the blackened fish tacos. Perfection! Service from Dominic and Kelly  was outstanding. We will definitely be back. Oh and the margaritas are excellent too!"}
{"text":"I think Bomba is good, but I'm not raving about it. The tacos were tasty, but I didn't leave saying YOU NEED TO TRY BOMBA. Its basically what you'd expect for a taco and rum bar."}
{"text":"Loved it here! The bartenders Mike and Natalie were awesome and friendly! The sangria was delicious as was the guacamole and tacos we ordered. Definitely in the rotation for date night!"}
{"text":"We moved away and came back, and Bomba has definitely improved! Even ordering from ubereats, the quality and flavors were very good. Would order again for sure!"}
{"text":"I just wasn't impressed, and I really wanted to like this place! Honestly, I tried. Buckle up, and let's go.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is a mix of family feeling and trendy. While it would sound bizarre, it worked. So, that was good.   Our server was very personable. She was attentive at first. At first being the key. We were a party of 3, each ordered two tacos and a side of the fries to split. It took almost 40 minutes for our food to come out. Then, the waitress disappeared. We had to track her down to get another drink and more water. There were literally 8 tables left when we were received our food. Where in the world did she go? Oh well. It happens.   Onto the food:I had the Bbq pork taco and the chicken Tinga taco. The pork one was pretty good. Very saucy (which all good BBQ is), a lot of cabbage. Like overwhelming amounts. The chicken Tinga I can honestly say is one of the absolute most disgusting things I have ever tasted, and my child at one point peed in my mouth (as a newborn). It was so so gross. The sauce was horrible. The chicken was massively overcooked. I just, blech, I gag thinking about it.  So, there you have it. Based on my experience, I wouldn't return. Take the extra few second trip and go to Barrio, or hell hit up TBell. At least there you know what you're getting."}
{"text":"On a spur of the night date night I suggested my boyfriend and I check out this place-and what a fun & scrumptious treat! Our waiter Curt was a fantastic guide to all the fun flavors and experience at Bomba. We enjoyed a variety of great tacos, perfectly balanced guacamole and tastes of some unique rums."}
{"text":"Bomba was definitely a disappointment. I had been wanting to try it for a while and finally came for tacos. Firstly, I think it is overpriced ($6 for plain guacamole--even expensive momochos gives you a  much greater amount).   I am severely allergic to mangos and saw that a couple items had them as a topping. I ordered something different but specifically asked my waitress to make sure there wasn't mangos in what I ordered and that there wasn't cross contamination if spoons or whatever mixed ingredients bc of the allergy. We ordered an appetizer of the bacon jalepenos, and surprise, it is on a bed of what I thought was mango slaw (NOT LISTED IN THE INGREDIENTS on the menu). Luckily I'm cautious and the manager (I think?) happened to walk by so I asked him what was in it, and he confirmed. I then asked him to double check my taco order. They brought the tacos out and there were literally slices of mango on top of almost all the tacos. The manager was really great and came running back saying he had them already making mine over without, but how could this waitress miss that? That is extremely dangerous. She never even came back to apologize.   I'm still giving two stars bc the tacos were pretty bland (I dunno, maybe they just need the mango slaw). But the pork pastor tacos tasted like seafood which didn't seem right either.  Out of all the options for tacos in greater Cleveland area, I don't really know how this place continues to make the cut."}
{"text":"Favorite tacos on the Westside.  Service is solid (though kitchen sometimes slow).  Love the Dark and Stormy and Mojitos.  Everything Barrio is not."}
{"text":"Just updating this review since it has been a month or so since we have been in... We were told that they started a bowl of rice instead of having plantains... The pineapple pork and rice did lack flavor. What we did love and will always come back to order is the mango cilantro margarita, bacon wrapped jalapeños and the corn on the cob. Pretty much everything on the \"Snack\" menu!! There is this server that was named Curt, he was so pleasant, mellow and very inviting!!"}
{"text":"Tacos and elote at 1115 am on Friday? Thats a great friday to start the weekend if you are at Bomba Tacos and Rum. So happy we decided to stop in here after shopping at Whole Foods across the street.  We were one of the first patrons and got waited on hand and foot by our server. Coffee was from a local cleveland brewery and it was wonderful. Will have to try the rum next visit, maybe for weekend brunch. She explained the menu which was fun and different. A little something something for everyone. Lunch specials of 2 tacos and a salad OR 3 tacos and a side for less than $10...how can you go wrong? Elote corn on the cob whoch is one of my faves was awesome.   Fresh guacamole with plantain chips was a wonderful accompaniment.  Great quality food, great service and the Manager was awesome. We watched him make his rounds to all the tables to say hi and ask about the food.  We enjoyed speaking with him and he made us feel so welconme! Thanks so much! Will be back!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I heard this place was opening, it is in a great location and has everything I love, tacos and tequila!   A friend and I tried to go for happy hour on Friday and there was an hour and a half wait, so please expect that if you try to go on a weekend.  So we decided to not stay that day, but I came back last night and there was no wait at all.    We got there right at 6:30 so Happy Hour was over, but to be honest nothing looked to be that great of a deal on it.  I got a margarita and my friend got one of their rum drinks, they were both delicious and definitely strong.    For dinner we ordered the traditional guacamole, you can tell it is definitely fresh but in my opinion it needed a little seasoning, salt, pepper etc.  Then we each got two different tacos, the coconut mango rice, and the yucca fries.  My tacos were good, satisfying, and let me tell you, one person does not need 3-4 to be full! I barley finished two.  The Yucca fries were delicious, but a little too much of the sauce was on it for me, and again the rice was good.  I think my problem was I just didn't love it.  None of the flavors were out of the ordinary, nothing I would crave.    Since they did just open I will go back and give them another try and get a few different things off the menu, I just think for all the Mexican places that surround the west side it doesn't hold it's own."}
{"text":"Great food!  The best tacos on the Westside.  And great ambiance.  Staff were efficient and the prices are fare."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during a business trip. Great good, great service, nice seating area. Definitely would go back if ever back in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour, and I was a little disappointed. The service was great- the problem was the value. Drinks were all $5, which is okay, but there are better happy hour drink specials out there. The real let-down was the food. We ordered the chicken empanadas and the chorizo empanadas. It was $4 for each, and each had 2 empanadas. We expected to get maybe 4 per order for happy hour, but I thought if here amazing empanadas, $2 for each empanada might be great! However, these empanadas were definitely not amazing. The crusts weren't crispy, the flavors were all kind of muddy, and everything was drowned in a mayonnaise sauce. I've had amazing empanadas before, and these were anything but. Maybe the regular menu items are better, but for happy hour, I would recommend venturing elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best variety of chips. The roasted corn is wonderful. Build your own guacamole, loved it, great idea. The chorizo & fried egg torta had no flavor and was very tiny. Garlic kale was very salty in spots and lacked flavor in other spots. Yucca fries are great. Get sauce on the side, that way you can dip instead of having it all over the place because it tends to make it soggy in spots. Very friendly staff. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow, literally first and last time I will come in. Save yourself the trip and go to Barrio or Townhall or anywhere else with tacos honestly, my friend and I both did not enjoy our food, the bartender was less than accommodating, seemed more concerned with talking to kitchen staff and wandering around. Will not be back. Definitely not."}
{"text":"No bike parking However we were told it was ordered?!? Funky taco combinations however not all of them worked.  Too much going on I. A couple if them."}
{"text":"Mojitos for days! The food is just fantastic. Did I mension they have the best mojitos?"}
{"text":"I have reviewed this before and the variety of tacos and the price point on them are excellent. The drinks were tasty as well. Thursday afternoon wasn't crowded like the weekends when the wait could exceed easily an hour or more .  Coming to the drinks,Try the cilantro coconut tequila cooler, it's yummy and available for a limited time. Sangria was strong surprisingly and the rum punch had the nice clove taste of the rum. The margarita was slightly salty.  Tacos tacos they are so delicious. The spicy cauliflower is yet another addition to the taco family and its spicy and delicious. Well worth the visit. The service was first rate. Joe was attentive and yet not intrusive and gave us our time. Again Thursday afternoon was probably the key."}
{"text":"Had a rice bowl here with the guacamole side and a bowl of the tortilla soup. I thought it was really good and so did my girlfriend, we definitely plan to come back here again. The guac was served with interesting chips made from shaved yucca and a few others I can't remember. The waitress Samantha was awesome as well, and I really like the atmosphere. Definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"I love tacos, I even have shirts proclaiming my love for them and I was beyond stoked with the addition of the taco emoji. I have looked for that one numerous times before its introduction. Buuuuuuuut I don't love Bomba. I've tried. Twice actually. The guacamole add hot peppers and bacon is good. The variety of chips is a nice change of pace from your traditional tortilla. The tacos though, 8/8 thumbs down. Barrio wins. No doubt."}
{"text":"One of the best taco joints ever!unbelievable rum selection and plantain foster buttermilk pancakes!!!! Omgosh! Yummy! The cornbread was huge! Had them both for breakfast the next day and they were just as good!!!"}
{"text":"Came to Bomba with a group for dinner after seeing good reviews on Yelp. We were all a bit disappointed with the food, even through the service was great and the restaurant itself had a fun and energetic vibe. I had four tacos, only two of which I can say I liked (rio chicken and cauliflower), and one which I only finished as not to waste the food (mushroom). I wasn't a big fan of the corn/flour blend tortillas, and most of the tacos had a poor filling to tortilla ratio...to the point where almost half of the bites of taco were simply carbs."}
{"text":"I'm gluten free and this place has mostly gluten-free food. So it had me at that. But then I tried the chips and guac and was so pleasantly surprised by the plantains and root chips. I try not to eat corn, so that was a great and tasty option. The tacos are amazing. Rum drinks are fantastic. Atmosphere is cool. Service warm and friendly. Love bomba!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal at bomba! Our server was helpful and kind. The mango salsa was delicious and the chips it came with were very unique (plantains, corn, something else?). My watermelon basil margarita was small but had a nice fresh taste. Would go back again, probably during happy hour!"}
{"text":"If you have ever been to Miami this is not Cuban food.  Place has a nice atmosphere and a lively drink menu, tacos not so good, service very slow the two times I have been here and the Mojito really needs some work.  Sad the Burtwood actually has a better Mojito and its \"okay\" by my standards."}
{"text":"Thank you JOSIE for making our evening great!  So glad that we decided to come back and give it a 2nd try! Thank you to management for the special treatment and the recommendations."}
{"text":"Weak service  Weak queso  Decent patio  Average dranks  Unlikely to return soon"}
{"text":"i had an amazing time here, and i'd like to give kudos to our server, curt, for being very helpful and making us feel at home.  we had some mojitos & queso dip (which was excellent)...for the tacos, we decided on the traditional chicken taco, the spicy chicken (which was great) and the crab (which was new, sneaky hot, but fairly average in my book).  hard to really find anything wrong...i'll definitely be back soon for more!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and I was just too damn lazy to write up my experience after the first time. Actually, it's probably a good thing I never got around to it, because now I think I've got it down.  How best should one describe Bomba? Well, the name really says it all - tacos and rum. That's what Bomba is all about. Since I don't drink rum and haven't since college I basically miss out on 50% of what makes Bomba Bomba. That means that for me it's basically just a pricey taco joint. Sure, if rum's your thing they've got enough of the stuff on hand to kill Ben Sanderson about three times over. According to the menu, \"over 75 kinds of rum\" to be exact. They've also got fancy-schmancy rum-fueled cocktails and other froo-froo drinks. Beer (only 8 taps and around 20 bottles/cans) and wine are relative afterthoughts in he grand scheme. If you dig deep enough you'll find a craft beer or two that you may not have had before. They also serve 16-oz pints of their draught beers. Kudos for that.  And what the hell's with listing a beer's price as \"MKT\"? It's not like it's freakin' lobster. Seriously.  The atmosphere is what you'd expect of a place of its ilk in Rocky River. It's not too fancy and not too casual. Nothing that'll really make you go \"wow\" but it's comfy enough. The service we received on both of our visits was pretty good. Servers are friendly and attentive and I don't recall having to wait too long for anything. They did screw up my wife's drink during our last visit, serving her the wrong mojito, but not a huge deal.  As others have mentioned, they don't give you free chips and salsa. To these people I say, who gives a shit. So you have to spend $3.50. Get over it. It's not like you need to cram your food hole with 1000 calories of corn anyway. They also don't serve plain old tortilla chips which I found to be a nice change of pace. The chips are a mixture of yucca, plantain, malanga and corn chips. Salsas are good, come in four varieties, and taste fresh. I'm not a guacamole fan, but if you are, be prepared to fork over more than you probably think guacamole is worth. Basic guac starts at $6 but by forewarned. If you fancy it up with mix-ins like pickled onion, pumpkin seeds and goat cheese you may be staring at an $8 bowl.  For starters they've got a nice selection of apps like empanadas, tostones, queso, even bacon-wrapped jalapenos. The crispy, flavorful empanadas are a tad on the small side, but the ooey-gooey fundido is well worth the calories. Now, the real star of this show is the tacos.  Here's the deal. All of their tacos are served in a corn/flour hybrid tortilla and you've got 18 different varieties from which to choose.Between my wife and I we've covered well over half of them already. I won't go into a detailed review of each taco type, but I will hit on some of the highlights:  -Others have mentioned the soggy taco thing. Sure, some of them may be a bit on the watery/drippy side. They use fruits, fresh-chopped veggies and the like. They contain water. Ergo things are bound to get a little soggy. You'll be OK. It's called a napkin. -The ingredients are very flavorful and very fresh. One of the best things about Bomba. -The chorizo/potato is among my favorites but damn, it'll grease up your face. -The fried avacado. Interesting concept, just too much oil and breading. Seriously, it's half an avocado breaded and deep-fried. -A spicy cauliflower taco with orange-soaked raisins and lime crema? Sounds weird, tastes amazing. -Two words. Lamb barbacoa. Just get it. -They are a bit skimpy on the proteins. I'm just sayin', expect more plant than animal in your tacos. -I really think the taco shells should be heated up, maybe even charred a little before service. This little touch would add a nice dimension to the product.  So, that about sums it up for me and Bomba. They make for a nice break from the fast-casual taco joints littering the landscape, that's for sure. If you're looking for some creatively curated tacos made from fresh ingredients, ridiculous amounts of rum, good service, all at a pretty affordable price, they'll do you right."}
{"text":"Build. Your. Own. Guac.   That's right. BYOG.   I chose to add in pico & roasted garlic to mine. I can't even begin to describe how amazing it was. Just enough lime. Chunky avocado. Delicious add in's. Beautiful food harmony.   Chips were delicious. Served warm and had just the right amount of salt.   You should also try the drinks! They are strong and delicious. I highly recommend the pomegranate-ginger mojito! SO GOOD. It's like a sour & lime dream.   Tacos are really good as well. A beautiful soft tortilla stuffed with carne asada, queso fresco, and salsa that will tango with your taste buds & make you praise da lort you wore leggings bc now you can fuck up some tacos with no regret"}
{"text":"I was delighted by Bomba! Let's face it- tacos are the best food on earth and Bomba does 'em right.  Bomba excels at creating inventive yet simply delicious taco options. I enjoyed the chicken tinga taco and chorizo & potato taco. Yum!   My favorite part of the meal, though, was the queso fundido which was served with yucca and plaintain chips OMG.   Bomba's decor and ambiance was fun, creative, and inviting. I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow! Hype is everything in a seemingly, very limited Rocky River! Drinks were the highlight; that's considering the 2 inedible tacos I sent back after a \"chefs hand\" attempted to argue with me about my selections. Not only was my \"crispy shrimp\" rock-hard, it arrived mixed in with my hubby's tacos/smashed together on a single dish, much too small for 5 tacos! The \"goat cheese\" in my 2nd choice, tasted like sour cream and there was nothing candied about the pepitas in that mushroom taco! My hubby's fish tacos arrived with one fried to oblivion and the other indistinguishable! The real/only draw is the decor--it's a very sensational spread! Nonetheless, relaxed & open spacing is hardly enough to draw a second appearance from me! This is a restaurant, I'm supposed to want to dine here first!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a few friends. The wait was pretty long (1hr around 7pm on a Friday night) but they have open seating on the patio.  The ambience was really nice! The food was okay. I tried two of the vegetarian taco options. Fresh ingredients but I'd say the taste was average.   The restaurant is sisters with Paladar which is on the east side. I definitely liked Paladar better."}
{"text":"The service lacks but not because they are not attentive but since it's packed all the time. It's hard to get quick service but I will continue to keep coming back..I absolutely love their menu. Their spicy cauliflower taco is AMAZING."}
{"text":"Great food - loved the variety. Street tacos, my own choice of guacamole mix ins, and smooth Flan to finish the meal was a perfect treat by my awesome son. Kilian, with Alan joining us. Nice night and definitely recommend Joey to wait on you!!"}
{"text":"My husband, 18 month old daughter & I came for dinner tonight at 5:30. We sat outside. The food was great. We made our own guac which came with plantain chips. For dinner my husband got the ceviche, the chicken rice bowl, and I got three tacos. We ended the meal with the caramel flan which was so yummy. Everything was delicious. I will 100% come back. The only flaw for me was that the tacos were dripping with the sauce, so a little less sauce would be perfection."}
{"text":"Outstanding guacamole and appetizer dips. Unique tacos that, while maybe a bit on the small side, all packed a punch and were excellent. Very good mojitos with some interesting flavor combos. Unobtrusive service, and a very good value. What more can one ask for? It's becoming a favorite.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, because it's conveniently located and has a nice atmosphere. But I've been twice now and with so many other better taco/mex/S. American options in the area I can't justify coming here again.    On my first visit I was not impressed with the happy hour options or the tacos which is all that I ordered. I had this cheese and bean dip from one of their seasonal menus a couple months ago, and the dips came out in little plastic cups, like the disposable kind. Not to mention they were warm dips, which I hate to be served in plastic, but I wasn't expecting disposable ware at a place like this. Aside from that, the tacos were much smaller in size than anywhere else in the area I've tried.  Interesting combinations, but not much bang for your buck.   Again this weekend, I came in for drinks and dinner with some friends who suggested it. My husband and I each had a beer at the bar while we waited for our table. The beers are overpriced. We paid $6 or $7 for an average beer.  I ordered tacos again, hoping for a better experience this time but again I was disappointed. Not too bad on the taste, as they were interesting combinations, but on the amount of toppings and the shell. $3-$4 for a taco is standard but seriously guys the tacos at Barrio are twice the size! (And equal in taste, creativeness - plus you can build your own)  My husband tried the Torta. It was so tiny! I almost dropped my jaw when his plate arrived, especially because it was $10 and came with nothing. He ordered fries for an extra $3. Usually tortas are a bigger sandwich, Mexican style anyway. Not here, I guess.   Service was slow, and since they give you a container of water for your table it seems they never have to return. It was a busy night, I will give them that.   This place has some promising qualities, especially being a cute and trendy place with a nice bar, but if you're looking for really good tacos I'd definitely skip it. Venture down to LaPlaza for the best authentic Mex tacos and tortas, Fresco (practically neighbors to Bomba at Beachcliff), Barrio, or one of the local pupuserias."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Slow service, terrible frozen food, and and always had empty drinks."}
{"text":"Wonderful,  service was great food was great. We sat at the bar and every bartender was super knowledgeable and personable. 4 THUMBS UP."}
{"text":"I'd like to give the place a better rating, but their margaritas are not good.  A taco joint needs to have good margaritas.   Anyway, the bartenders are attentive and really friendly.  A+ there.  The tacos I had were all good.  My favorite is the sweet potato.  The Happy Hour prices were good and we got there before 5, so it wasn't even crowded.  It did fill up after 5:30 or so.   I will go back again, but stick to beer."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best restaurants in the Cleveland area. Great service, fun drinks, delicious food. There are options for everyone. I have been here at least 6 times and I have yet to try something I don't like. I have been to Paladar and the food here is better. More flavorful. It also has brunch! Which, I have not gone to yet but that's next on my list. If you are debating on where to go tonight, look no further! You will be back."}
{"text":"So...I just signed up with yelp, have used the app religiously for several years, just to comment on this place!   Horrible experience!   We called in for pick up, was impressed by how nice the girl was over the phone, however, our order was not right, which we didn't notice until we got home. :-/  We ordered:  Guacamole with goat cheese, the container it came in was less than half full and the goat cheese was...literally a dime size glop on top of the guacamole which cost $1 extra! The guac was bland.   Yuca fries, I GOT FIVE and they were way over salted!  Tacos, nothing better than 'bar food' tacos  So very disappointed:-("}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here for their brunch. The food is always fresh, the drinks delicious, and the atmosphere is laid back. Highly suggest checking this place out."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. The fish tacos are great and plantain chips. A little pricey $3-4 for a taco that is eaten in 3 bites. The decor and layout are cute and different from other places on the westside. Only thing holding this place back is service! Many servers are obviously new and starting out. The reason there is always a line is bc it takes them 2.5 hours to turn a table. Ours seat us then come back for drink orders 20 min later the food orders 20 min after that. I think when that's fixed it'll be a great place."}
{"text":"Yum!  the variety of tacos is amazing and the prices are just right.  So tied of high priced restaurants.  I tried a lamb taco and a chicken variety as well and it was so good.  The guacamole is amazing!  Finally, a good place on the west side!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their sister restaurant, (Paladar in Woodmere), so the news that they were opening up a taco place in RR got me excited! I came in around 5:30pm on a Saturday, (their second day open), and this place was packed! It was a little crazy inside but that is to be expected and management seemed to be on top of it. The staff I encountered were actually seasoned workers from Paladar so that probably helps a lot with making the opening of Bomba as smooth as possible. I heard a hostess say something about an hour long wait so I decided to just snag a spot at the bar and order some food to-go. My wait was about 30 minutes, but it wasn't bad as I made some small talk with the friendly older gentleman next to me who was enjoying his beer. (I do regret not ordering a mojito while I was waiting though, those things are so good!)   Now for the food!  -Traditional Guac $5.50: Pretty simple but I love that it comes with a mix of yucca, plantain,malanga and corn chips. -BBQ Duck Tostones $9.50: These are really tasty, but damn that price for only 3.   -Tacos: Crispy Fish, Roasted Pork Al Pastor, Chorizo & Potato $3 each: I got these on the flour tortillas and thought they were all pretty tasty.   If you want to liven up the traditional guac you can, but the additional ingredients will cost you .50-$1 each. They have 19 taco options for you to choose from with each taco costing $3-$4 and a recommendation that you get 3-4 per person. It would be great if they had a discounted taco hour or taco night. Sides are $3.50 each and are things like coconut mango rice, black bean soup, salvadorian slaw, or adobo fries.   All in all I think Bomba is a welcomed addition to RR and that it will do very well here. This place doesn't offer huge portions and it's not the cheapest, but the food hit the spot for me so I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Build your own guac? Um, YES. The moment I saw this I knew we had to try it.  That's the main reason we tried Bomba Tacos & Rum.  Visited for an early dinner on 5/27 (Memorial Day weekend).  Our server said they were SLAMMED at lunch, but we managed to beat the dinner crowd.  Ordered BYOG with bacon and goat cheese.  HOLY COW.  (or goat?)  It was delicious!  And served with not only tortilla chips, but also plantain chips and malagna chips too. Great appetizer, and came out quickly. My sister and I each ordered 3 different tacos.  I ordered the chicken tinga, the blackened fish, and the charred kale and corn.  The fish was my favorite by far! I think it was the pineapple slaw that just MADE that taco.  Chicken tinga was awesome, with the smokey chipotle flavoring.  Kale was good too, but didn't get the full effect of all flavors present till the middle of the taco.  Still enjoyable.  She ordered Seasonal grilled zuchinni, original chicken, and Carne asada.  Carne asada was the BIG winner here!  Tasted fresh off the grill (and probably was!) The others were tasty too, but how do you beat a carne asada taco done right!? Our server (Brian) was very nice.  Let us order ginger beer off the menu (we saw it as an ingredient in a drink but only wanted the ginger beer.)"}
{"text":"Best Mexican on the west side.  Not especially authentic but very very good.  Great selection so multiple trips needed to sample everything.  The chip basket is a real nice change from the typical.  This will be a summer hangout for us.  Great drinks, great value.  Three tacos and a side for 9.99.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their guac is the best. Great service, delicious food, and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Bomba for my birthday with my dear husband. We loved it!!! Started with guacamole that we added pickled red onion and bacon to... delicious! I would suggest they leave the tortilla chips out and load up that basket with plantains and malanga - YUM!!!! We ordered a bunch of tacos: cauliflower, duck, spicy shrimp, tuna poke, sweet potato and crispy shrimp. My favorite was the tuna poke, which was a delightful Asian fusion twist on a fish taco! We really enjoyed all of the tacos, but my least favorite was the sweet potato... just a little too sweet for my savory self. We also tried a couple of drinks... a charred pineapple caipirinha and the plantation mai tai... tasty and the mai tai was STRONG, no skimping on the liquor. Our server then brought us out a complimentary basket of sweet potato donuts with coffee cream dipping glaze. The donuts were underdone, but the manager came over and acknowledged the problem and brought us another basket... which my husband enjoyed for breakfast the next day!!!!   Bomba, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"AWESOME!!!!!! Bacon, goat cheese and mango guac!! get it!  The pastor taco is the best taco I have ever had. The lamb and chrorizo are also great.  The one draw back about this place.... Come to think of it it's the only draw back that I can find is the  un-appetizing  amount of hipsters.... Flannel and moustaches as far as the eye can see.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Disappointed this time around. We added cheese to each of our tacos and they charged us $1 per (to be expected), but only 1 taco had the cheese on it. Additionally, it appeared that some of the other toppings that each taco comes with (according to the menu), were scarce or missing. Maybe this was an off night? It was after 9 PM during the week and they weren't that busy. Don't rule them out, but I don't think we'll go back now that we're not located near by. The shrimp guac is still excellent and must try."}
{"text":"People with the negative reviews because they thought it would be a Mexican Restaurant are fools. Latin food quite different then Mexican food.  This place is awesome. Read the menu close. But they will make whatever you want. I had 3 taco's..oh yeah the drinks are just WOW."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Bomba since it opened a few years ago so I was very excited to try it last week. I went with a friend after attending an event down the street. When we arrived it wasn't too crowded, but I think because of the event it got packed a little later after we got there. At first the service was great and the waiter was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. However, it took a long time to place drink and salsa orders and then finally place our food order. We were done with our chips and salsa before we were able to track down the waiter to place our food order. I will cut some slack because it did get crowded, however I wish we could've placed our order sooner.   For the drinks and food I was pleased. The waiter recommended the pomegranate ginger mojito. I'm usually not a ginger fan and he said this drink could be too sweet for some people, but I loved it and recommend it! They had a variety of salsas to choose from and we went with the most basic- fire roasted tomato. Very good! Next time I'll have to try a make your own guac. I then ordered 2 tacos- Zucchini and Black Bean and Sweet Potato (minus hot sauce). They were both very good, smaller so you could order 2-4. The prices were not bad here at all. I would recommend this place on a less crowded night."}
{"text":"If you are a rum drinker like me you could spend a lot of money trying out their selection of different rums. The track selection is fantastic as well. They are a little heavy on the jalapeno peppers some of the selections."}
{"text":"Food is high quality. I've tried many of the different tacos and they are all excellent. Lots of vegetarian choices. Definitely worth trying as there are many unique combinations to choose from. Like the desserts too."}
{"text":"The duck taco is amazing! Come get it before it leaves!! Had the BBQ pork and the mango salad both of which were average, but this duck taco was superb. Also they have three tacos and a side or two tacos and a salad for 9.95 during weekday lunch, which is a really nice deal!"}
{"text":"We have eaten there twice and both times the food is good and drinks are generous. But this last time really made my week, we had a large party of relatives in town. I called around noon for the call ahead seating and spoke with the manager Mike. He was incredibly pleasant and assured me a table would be waiting. Now here's the thing, we've tried call ahead seating at different places throughout NE Ohio to various success so I arrived 20 minutes early to make sure we had a table. Not only was the table available it was already ready for us and they were kind enough to let me sit and wait for everyone. I had several people stop by to make I was alright. I and my family were well taken care of."}
{"text":"Just okay. The el pastor tacos were a poor example of a great dish. No wait on a Thursday afternoon. But I wouldn't wait longer than 10 minutes"}
{"text":"Incredible! I had such a wonderful experience. I had really great service from the bartender, mike. I had the slow braised duck taco, the rio style chicken taco, and the quest fundido with chorizo and everything was out of this world. For drinks I had the Atlantico Rum punch and the Pineapple lime colada. Both were absolutely delicious. I look forward to coming back and I can't wait to bring friends."}
{"text":"Returned for a date night with my husband.   The guacamole is fantastic!  You can create your own-I recommend the jalapeño with bacon guac.  However for over $5.00 you don't get very much.    I had the chorizo and potato taco and the lamb barbacoa.  The chorizo took first prize!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have gotten their tacos as take out a few times and we really liked them a lot!  The kale side dish and guacamole also were good (although I am not a big fan of the mixed chips) and the wait for the food was short."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try a new taco place, particularly after hearing a lot of hype from coworkers who had gone. However I was disappointed. After having to buy chips and salsa separate - they're not included as with most Mexican restaurants - the standard and spicy salsas were bland and not worth the $. (The mint verde was delicious, though). And most of the tacos our group of 4 tried ranged from meh to no thanks. I will say that their chorizo sandwich was pretty tasty, although a little dry, and their french fries are excellent. Go figure! The restaurant was very clean and had interesting decor, although it was packed and extremely noisy - although that comes with being a new place to try in town. I can't say I'm fussed to go back any time soon, I'll stick to tastier for cheaper Mexican restaurants, but we'll see how it picks up with some more experience and feedback."}
{"text":"Thank you I Heart Radio Deals!   For $25 I scored $50 for food (and drinks!)  Food:  Different, it's like Columbian style tacos. Very unique.... The quac was a little pricey in my opinion but OK.   Tacos were good, and definitely not your average taco. I'd say try it for a change!   Drinks were pretty damn good, that brought this up from a 3 star to 4.   Atmosphere:  PACKED! On a Saturday night, super crowded, food took a little while longer but it was pretty packed. Cool vide, casual.   I'd recommend it, but man I'm forever a Barrio girl."}
{"text":"Bomba has the best menu! I absolutely love their mixed drinks, the mango cilantro mojito is ridiculously good. I think the best part about bomba is that the quality and service are really consistent."}
{"text":"I can't imagine what took me so long to try this place -- now I can't imagine how I can possibly wait another minute to go back! I absolutely loved my tacos -- what a great selection -- but I can't remember which ones I ordered -- my head is still spinning, they were so good! So many more choices to try on my return visit! Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"This place has a very nice venue, but the food left a lot to be desired. I felt that the taco that I had could of had more seasoning. Also I got a scallion rice. The rice was quite hard and could of been cooked longer. I don't think I would be coming back."}
{"text":"holy taco goodness! yes. i LOVE that there are so many tacos to choose from.  lunch specials are amazing. minimally priced, but so filling and portions are huge.  drinks are pretty great as well.  i have been about 4 times now and can honestly say, i have never been disappointed.  i can't even begin to tell you which tacos i love best, because they are all THAT yummy.  the coconut rice=ohhhmyword. DELICIOUS.  i love that you can add things to the traditional guac to switch it up a bit.  decor is pretty cute. great for friends to gather and great for a date!  service can sometimes be a little slow at busy times, but hey have another mojito or margarita! who's counting, right?!"}
{"text":"If going to Bomba, expect a pretty hip and new twist on Latin cuisine. I had yuca fries with a DELICIOUS garlic aioli, tostones topped with a mountain of pork and guac, and a burrito bowl with carne asada, carrots, & cilantro rice. We also got a side of goat cheese guac along with a chicken salad (it was giant). I also ordered a pomegranate-ginger mojito. It was strong but tasty!  There really anything that I didn't enjoy and will definitely be back for those yuca fries!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to update my review since my first trip, but kept forgetting. First off, after I wrote my first review the manager contacted me and apologized and wanted to know more about my experience to see how they can do better. For me that shows a lot about a company. I'm a firm believer that it's not always what a company did bad/wrong, but how and what they do to resolve the problem. My boyfriend and I stopped in during the week a few weeks back and gave it a second shot. I will say what a world of a difference! Our interaction with all the staff was very friendly and personable. Our tacos were delish! I ordered the Chicken Tinga, Blackened Fish and my favorite- the Chipotle Mushroom. My boyfriend seemed pretty happy with his tacos too considering he packed his 5 tacos in before I ate my three! I'm definitely glad I gave this place a second try!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of co-workers for happy hour. I was only able to taste a margarita and guacamole, but boy am I glad I did! The watermelon basil margarita was sweet but not overly sweet, and the build your own guacamole was awesome! I'm so glad they gave you a variety of different kinds of chips, it gave the guacamole different tastes with every bite. Personally, I think the add ons are a little expensive, but adding the pickled jalepenos to my guacamole made it taste sooooo good.  Hoping BOMBA reads this and adds guacamole to the happy hour menu"}
{"text":"The best dining experience I've had in years!!! Our waitress, Kim, was exceptional. She took excellent care of us without being obtrusive and you could not ask for better service. And the food, omg the food! The chips were even incredible!!! Not your run of the mill Mexican joint AT ALL. The flavor combinations on the tacos are delicious and the churros are the best I've ever had - including in Mexico! Awesome cocktail selection. A+"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Guac with bacon is to die for. We had four of them. Our waitress Kim was great! My kids even said \"mom, she deserves a good tip\". Thank you Kim for making my sons birthday dinner extra special."}
{"text":"Always busy but seem to get great service and with a smile! The food fare is diverse for most people and the combinations hit the spot.  And they have rum!  They have a good variety if you like rum."}
{"text":"Stellar menu and unique choices. No, you don't get free chips and salsa, but it's worth paying for. The unique selection of chips and their salsas are a meal in itself. It's right by my office on Detroit rd. Build your own guac? Yes, please...   Love their blended corn and flour tortillas. I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Came here on Easter Sunday for dinner which left it pretty empty but we were happy they were open! Our service was good, she came by almost every 10 minutes because it was empty.   We shared chips and salsa which was not bad. No where did I see it say the chips were tortilla (not homemade), yucca and plantain chips mixed. Note : I like all of these but I expected hot fresh tortilla chips. Then I had one chorizo potato taco, and bomba fries. The fries were seasoned with seasoning salt and adobo - shoestring fries and good amount of them. The taco had chorizo, potato, spicy aioli, and this type of cheese that was interesting and really good.   My roommate had a spicy chicken and a bbq beef one? I can't comment because I'm not sure but she said 2 tacos was a good serving. I could have eaten another taco.   I had the strawberry marg on the rocks - loved it. Sweet enough to enjoy but not syrupy. Yum."}
{"text":"Fair. Not the best. I went on my birthday and it didn't live up to expectation. Our party raved about the shrimp tacos but the duck were blah.  Coors light is $4.75, which was a complete turnoff.  I am going to try the happy hour specials at the bar."}
{"text":"enjoyed this fun place. High tops are uncomfortable after 30 mins... but maybe it's my old butt. Food quality is high. Nice addition to the area. Happy Hour is a great way to check it out."}
{"text":"Great traditional margaritas! The menu had a nice selection of tacos as well as other entrees. I had the shrimp taco and it was delicious. I also had the al pastor taco and while it was okay, I would certainly try another offering before ordering it again. The guacamole with goat cheese and bacon was excellent and the plantain and root vegetable chips were especially nice. There were also traditional tortilla chips served with the guacamole. Overall, a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Opening weekend in Fairlawn. Went with my husband and friend. We started with: Queso fundido ( melted cheese ) and tortillas. This was tasty.   Black bean soup - texture was on point but it didn't have much flavor. Empanadas- deep fried, five per order but they don't let you mix & max flavors. I'd skip them.  We all ordered tacos, 3 each per their recommendation. If you have a side, keep it in mind you can order less. I left stuffed.  My 3: crispy shrimp(spicy & ok), Rio style Chicken( good but dry), blackened fish (ok but could have been better), Husband's 3: pastor (loved it), lamb (not really the right taste for him), braised beef (loved it) Friend's 3: cauliflower (really liked it) fried avocado (ok and hard to eat as a taco), spicy shrimp (least favorite) No dessert this time since we left pretty full.  Staff was very pleasant.   Recommendation: do the tacos. Start with the smaller amount and order more if you need more."}
{"text":"I like jalapeno, but the jalapeno relish they use overpowers the tacos. I unfortunately couldn't taste anything but jalapeno for 2 out of the 3 tacos I ordered. The tacos weren't very large for $3.50/taco but perhaps I'm spoiled with Barrio. I was still hungry after 3 and an appetizer, and I didn't want to pay $14 to be mildly satisfied. The bartender who served us wasn't great, kind of took forever to get us our beverages and was more concerned with changing the channel on the TV. It wasn't a surprise that this place was empty."}
{"text":"Bomba has so much potential.  I stopped in with a friend after a movie. The customer service was a little odd--they verbally told us they were closing soon and seemed a little off-put we were there (it was 1.5 hours until close, and other folks were in there). So that started things off a little awkward. I think in terms for suburban taco options, Bomba is great for people who live in the area, but all of us who know Barrio will just be constantly spoiled. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable about the menu, so we went with tacos.  The taco portions were a tad small, with some unusual flavors. The fried avocado taco sounded like a good idea, but just ended up being a bit mushy. The chicken tinga taco was good and had a nice kick to it, but I don't think I hit the money on either of these tacos. The taco shells, though meant to be soft, were a bit hard.   The service was fairly quick and the restaurant had a cute ambience. The bar was really hoppin'. While my food was just OK, my drink (margarita) was absolutely delicious, as was the side of plantains and the mango friend rice. If you're in the market for Bomba, I imagine it's a great place for small plates and drinks."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and the last time it was 97.00 for LUNCH before tip.  We all left hungry and seriously went to another place to get more tacos.  Who thinks it is a fair price to charge 2.50 for some dinky taco with purple slaw crap on it and 7-8 dollar drinks with a thimble full of booze in em?  Dummies, that's who.  Yuppie tacos don't do anything for me.  Glad to see the guy who Michael Symon canned from Lolita got another job bartending, though..."}
{"text":"Avoid at all cost!!! The food was so cold and overpriced!! Me and  a couple of friends were there tonite, we ordered duck, chorizo, al pastor tacos and a havana sandwich, everything was cold, not warm frigging cold.  The bartender was nice and warm up some of the tacos. The service was ok the beers were overpriced too, the tacos had no flavor  the havana sandwich was so small and it comes with no sides.  I really wanted to like this place, but sadly,i wont be coming back here there are better places than serve better hot and tasty food with better prices"}
{"text":"Great Latin restaurant and an excellent taco bar as well.  The guacamole and salsa alone with the root vegetable chips will fill you up; you can also add stuff to your dip to make it more elaborate.  The tacos are incredible with so many variations; it's nearly endless!  They are not cheap, but well worth your money.  They also have almost every kind of premium ru and tequila south of the U.S.; you'll get a great cocktail from this location.  The service is excellent and prompt too!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb-a. Sorry, had to. But seriously, it's really great.   I've grown tired of my beloved Barrio, whose employees are a bit pretentious & whose tacos are always bordering on inedibly wet, so I was excited to try out a new taco joint, albeit one much further from my Tremont home. While I probably wouldn't shlep out to Rocky River JUST for this food, I'd definitely stop in again the next time I'm out that way.  I love that Bomba has a large menu full of pre-made taco options (instead of having to build my own & usually failing). My boyfriend & I ordered three tacos apiece, which was probably one too many, but we couldn't decide which ones to try, so we just loaded up! I loved the crispy shrimp taco & the zucchini & black bean taco, especially, but everything else was good, too. I'd love to try everything on their menu, frankly! I also love that their guac is served with a combo of yucca, plantain, malanga, & corn chips. Something a little different than your standard bowl of tortilla chips.   My only issue was that the restaurant was a little loud, but that's because we just happened to be sitting next to some event - a bar crawl or something. Everyone seemed to be hammered - & VERY chatty. There were lots of other open tables in the restaurant, & I wish that, knowing they'd be hosting this event, the hostess had seated us elsewhere, but the event began halfway through our meal, so we didn't know to request otherwise until it was too late.  That aside, it was a particularly delicious experience, & I look forward to returning - hopefully at happy hour!"}
{"text":"Killer tacos, great cocktails cucumber tequila mojito, nice beer selection, only one change suggested patio is first come first serve on a warm nice night take control of those desirable seats"}
{"text":"Both experiences at bomba would send me back, especially the bartender Mike. He was extremely accommodating even though it was nearly bar close.  That's rare.  Tony as well... Makes you feel welcome.  Nice work."}
{"text":"Delicious! Started with a perfect mojito (love all the fresh mint and sugar cane swizzle stick). We got lucky to get a seat at the bar.  Tony was very friendly and attentive while so busy. Traditional guacamole and interesting yucca, plantain, taro and corn chips. I nibbled on the slaw under hubby's bacon wrapped jalapeños. Braised beef taco, crispy avocado taco and hubby's brisket sandwich rounded off our dinner. Oh yeah, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot! This place is so great! What a wonderful design and amazing use of space. I can't rave enough about how good the drinks were. I tried the pomegranate ginger margarita and it was absolutely delicious! During happy hour (from 3 - 6:30pm) all margs, mojitos and rum flights are $5! And $2 off wine and beer during happy hour.   All of the apps we tried were really good too. We had an order of guac, salsa, and the jalapeno cheese dip. I loved the assortment of chips they bring you. I think they were plantains, yucca, and regular tortilla chips - great combo! They have such an extensive menu and so many different tacos to choose from. They all sounded so good it was hard to decide what to try. The variety of tacos was great, for meat eaters and vegetarians alike! I ended up ordering the crispy fish taco and the spicy shrimp. Wow, they were perfect! The flavors were so yummy.  This place has it going on! The service was pretty good and it was our friend's birthday and they brought her a dessert (flan) with a candle. :) We were happy to celebrate her birthday here and check it out for the first time since it just opened. This place is an A+. Sorry Barrio you are out, Bomba is in! Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Ive always had a fun time here. Everything I have ordered was awesome. The best was a califlower taco. The staff is always fun to interact with. In the warmer months its a great place to enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"A-ok is the best way to describe this place, I think. My vegan tacos (I had to explain what vegan meant to my server and ask her about every ingredient in every taco to make sure I didn't accidentally get anything I couldn't eat) were just alright. It's been a couple days since I ate there and honestly, all I can remember eating was the avocado taco. And that was just ok, too. The guacamole I ordered was nothing to write home about and my drinks were solid, but...I'm in no rush to go back.   I would drink there - often - if I lived nearby, but as an east sider, I'll stick to having happy hour at Bomba's sister restaurant - Paladar."}
{"text":"Ordered the 10 tacos for $30 Best thing to do if you just want tacos and want to try different ones!!! For me being Mexican from California I could say they have great flavors to the tacos. Also add lime to everything!! I always ask for extra."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the tacos. They just opened so maybe working out the kinks. Will give them another shot"}
{"text":"I recently dined here on a visit home and was really impressed. It's probably even better than what I experienced because I didn't try the rum offerings on this visit. We sat in the covered patio area which was nice on a beautiful summer day and was very comfortable.  First, our waitress was a complete sweetheart and really helpful in explaining the menu and with menu suggestions. I wish I remembered her name...she had brown hair and glasses. She was very attentive and suggested a dish that I would have never thought to order on my own, but loved.   The lunch specials are very reasonably priced and generously portioned. We started with chips and salsa. I loved their unique touch since it did include some of the traditional tortilla chips, but also a variety of root vegetables made into chips. I chose the three taco and a side option. My taco choices were the crispy fish, chorizo and potato, and zucchini and charred corn. The flavors on all of the tacos was perfect, they chose great sauces and cheeses to make everything not only unique, but delicious. My side was the coconut rice with mango which was more like a dessert in a good way. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Ohio."}
{"text":"Food: Just average tacos. Great tasting guacamole! Liked the crispy thin chips, plantain, and yucca. Not too salty either. Drinks: Had the Mojito regular but couldn't taste the rum.  tried the Superior Mojito and it was slightly better. Atmosphere: LOUD and hard to hear person sitting next to. Chairs are loud rubbing wood on cement floor in the enclosed patio. Please put felt pads on the bottoms of the legs! It's obnoxiously loud!! I would come back for the guacamole and a drink."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was okay, service was pretty good, and the lunch special was a large portion for the price. But our food was underwhelming to say the least. Two of my friends and I ordered the guac with corn, black beans, and queso. It was bland and overpriced for the small portion and stale chips. Between the three of us we each ordered a side with three tacos. Combined we ordered the Al Pastor, BBQ pork, zucchini and corn, spicy shrimp, and sweet potato tacos. I finished my spicy shrimp, one of my friends finished her Al Pastor, and the other didn't finish a single one. Not somewhere I would recommend to friends or family."}
{"text":"Overall, we had a 5 star experience! The drinks were incredible. I enjoyed a strawverry mojito and my husband had the margarita. Both were fresh and tasty! We also sampled a few rums, just for fun.  We shared chips, salsa and queso fundido. The chips were your standard corn chips mixed with some fun root veggie chips, like: yucca, plaintain, malanga. Very unexpected & delish. I opted for tacos- zucchini & charred corn wa superb! Chicken tinga and rio-style chicken were both also good. I had the coconut mango rice on the side, too, and it was divine! I probably would only get two tacos next time given the size of the portions. My husband had both of the same chickens that I had, in addition he had the braised beef roasted pork al pastor. The braised beef was far & away his favorite.  Our server was knowledgeable, bubbly and always around when we needed her. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Like. Ugh, I just don't know about this place. I feel like it has a good thing going but it's just \"too much.\" The establishment itself is very modern and nice. The had a table for two immediately at 7pm on a Friday, so that was great! Service was pretty good. We got our food really quickly.   For the food... We ordered the \"make your own guacamole\"... Which is $6 and each topping you add in is either .50 or $1.00. We added corn which was .50 and goat cheese which was a dollar. We paid a dollar for one tiny little teaspoon full of goat cheese to sit at the top. Not cool. They don't serve normal chips on the side, which I didn't expect. Or love.  The tacos were ehh at best. They all sound so appetizing on the menu. I was not impressed by any of the ones I had, neither was my husband. I had a chicken tinga, crispy avocado, and chorizo and potato. Each one of them were drenched in sauces. Like I had to drain the sauce from each one. The only flavor they had was from the sauce. And for whatever reason, each taco had a huge handful of cabbage on them which totally ruined it for me.   They have an impressive selection of rum, though, which I didn't try. The bar was busy the whole time we were there. I feel like Bomba has promise, and in the future I would be willing to give it another chance. But for now, when I'm craving tacos, I think I will stick to the local taco joint in Lakewood.... (Barrio)."}
{"text":"I think I have reviewed this place before, but I recently revisited and was equally impressed. I love a well crafted cocktail and Bomba delivers. Lavender Bees Knees ....deliciously romantic with a hint of Spring to come. Perfect for Valentine's Day coming up. Great guacamole too!!!  I'll be back to try their swing on a classic Manhattan."}
{"text":"Came in w a large party and the staff was just not up for it...took a long LONG time to get even get the drink orders and guac and chip requests in. Servers had a hard time matching orders to guests and i asked for a refill that never came nor the pico and chips that never showed up. They just seemed outnumbered and disorganized even though our party was at 3:30 on a Sunday  and the rest of the restaurant didnt seem packed. Once we did order tacos, they rolled out quite quickly. Seemed the disconnect was the servers of which our party was assigned two (one actually didnt take my sisters order because she said \"im actually assigned to this side of the table\"...ok....)   But the servers  were friendly, perhaps just not accustomed to big groups , so be warned if you rolling in with your whole crew.  Ok, so now for the atmosphere, nice decor and branding, would like to come back in warmer weather because it looked like they had open air seating.   And then where they shined...the tacos!!  A couple people reported their tacos to be very soggy but delicious. I ordered the following 3 and they were not soggy at all. Enjoyed all of them, but the chorizo was my favorite (goat cheese yeah!)  RIO STYLE CHICKEN caramelized onions, poblano peppers, peanuts, cilantro aioli--$3.00  CHORIZO & POTATO goat cheese, smoky aioli--$3.00  BLACKENED FISH pickled onion & pineapple slaw, cilantro aioli--$4.00  Recommend the guacamole and chips (plantain chips yeah!)  Classic Margarita was perfection (I know, I know, should have ordered rum, but I love a Margarita on the rocks made well)."}
{"text":"Not impressed. They changed the menu. No more dinners. Ordered  a Cuban Sandwich showed up small wrapped in paper sitting on a plate. Very disappointed.  No chips or Salsa unless you paid for it. We have outstanding Mexican restaurants in Cleveland  by pass Bomba. There is nothing worth remembering."}
{"text":"I love their parent restaurant Paladar so I had to try Bomba. The guacamole and drinks are always on point. You can't go wrong with any drink. Plus, their chips of plantains, malanga and corn is so fresh and crispy.   Tacos can use a little work but I've been able to give feedback and the staff had always been so attentive and gracious. I really liked this chicken tinga, pork, and kale and corn. The crispy avocado is weird. I think a different batter might help.   The atmosphere is fun and I love the patio options of fully open and open doors.   But one of the best reasons about Bomba and Paladar... Their service. They are friendly, genuine, informative, and caring and I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I was going to give it 2 stars for the food but Jasmin the bartender was so nice I bumped the rating..  I want to like this place because I'm a huge taco fan and they do have creative ingredients but for some reason it just doesn't cut it.   I ordered the Rio Chicken taco and it came out so plain and tasteless.  Then the Pastor taco was a disaster.. it was so soaking wet I felt like I was eating pig slop soup.  The flavor was good but come on chef, plate them differently where the tacos are resting on a rack above the juices or something.    A couple ideas to the owner: Have some clever hot sauces to try and carry ice cold bottles of Mexican Coke. (Your fountain Coke is awful) I'm from California and don't understand why every taco place in Ohio uses flour tortillas??? Corn is the way to go."}
{"text":"Eh, the food was ok. It didn't meet the hype. There are other Mexican places not far away (Barrio) that are notably better, and less basic."}
{"text":"I can not say enough about the staff explaining everything.  We started with Jalapeño Guaq w a touch of honey the plantains were an extra bonus.  Glutten free soft tacos filled with chicken steak and the fish taco delish. Can't wait to go again price and food excellent and over 100 types of rum w drinks. Too bad I had to drive.  I give it a 4.3. Couldn't ask for a better time and atmosphere"}
{"text":"I love their huge rum selection! They even have a guide to rum on their tables to help you decide which rums would best suite your tastes, and if you still have questions the staff is very willing to recommend a rum or a flight. Jack Sparrow would love this place- The rum will NEVER be gone!  Now onto the food: The taco combinations are creative and tasty- especially their vegetarian taco options, which are more than just black beans and tomatoes. I ordered the fried avocado taco, which was creamy and crispy. They also have a sweet potato taco I plan on trying sometime soon. The braised beef taco was juicy and spicy (yay pickled jalapenos)! On their menu they suggest getting 3 or more tacos which is probably a good recommendation unless you just want a little snack.  I was excited to see fried plantains on the menu since I just go back from Puerto Rico. The plantains were sweeter than I expected, but I enjoyed them.   I also couldn't resist the heavenly, dreamy, creamy flan!!! The texture was excellent and it was eloquently plated. I think it was supposed to be coconut flavored, I couldn't really tell so maybe they could amp that up a bit, but I have no complaints when it comes to a well made flan."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that a restaurant that advertises itself as a \"rum bar\" cannot make a quality mojito. The sugar was settled at the bottom and not mixed in whatsoever. When I mixed it myself the mojito still just tasted like watered down rum with no flavor of mint or lime. I exchanged it for a pomegranate margarita which was good, but not the reason I came. The tacos were very good! But overall not a good experience. Our waiter who stated the mojito would be taken off the bill had not done so either. Lesson learned!"}
{"text":"As most reviews say, yes - the tacos are pretty small here for the price. You definitely get more bang for your buck at Barrio. However - the margaritas are the best! I really don't like margs with sweet & sour - and Bomba uses lime juice and agave instead. They have a great Ahi Tuna bowl that is delicious! And try the queso!"}
{"text":"I'm all about this place lately. So many taco spots are popping up, but Bomba has become my regular choice for a variety of reasons, especially after a previous bad experience at a different taco spot.  Atmosphere: all I know is, they have a patio! I'm obsessed with outdoor eating. In addition, the dining area is nice and open. Besides the patio, I've only eaten at the bar, and both are great options.  Service: I really love the staff here. They seem genuine, and they really know there stuff. Some places have a great staff but they may be lacking in their knowledge about the restaurant. I always find this okay, because a good attitude goes far, but in this spot, the staff is just always on its A game.  Food: yum. They have gluten free options noted on the menu, which is great for me. Their tacos are creative. You can omit ingredients, and they have a good variety of choices. The side dishes are bomb, (see what I did there), and I'm obsessed with their goat cheese guacamole. Anyone want to meet me there? Yelp outing?"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to go to Bomba the second day it opened and have gone a few times a month while i was living on the west side.   The staff is so great and I've never had a problem with any service there. The only problem I have come across was there usually is good amount of wait time, but that just means it's good to go to!  They have two sections in the restaurant and the one side is more of a family side that usually has a good amount of kids in it. The restaurant tends to be loud so I try to avoid that section because of how loud the kids can be.   The food is great packed with flavor. Everyone talks about their tacos which are delicious (especially the spicy shrimp) but don't forget about their large plates! Their pork dish is to die for.   It's a fun place for happy hour and a great place for a date or family. If you don't want to wait in line, get there earlier than normal dinner time. Oh, and don't forget to order the churros!"}
{"text":"BT&R is a GREAT place for delectable, healthy gourmet tacos that will make your taste buds dance!  And they have such a wide variety as well, from chicken, pork, beef, and seafood, to... I forgot the others.  We love ordering the cost saving 10 taco combo tray (you can order a variety of whatever flavor tacos you wish) to split among the 3 of us, and the food is more than enough.  The guacamole dip is 'out of this world' as well... so creamy and fresh tasting.  The chicken empanadas were mouth watering too.  The place has a central bar, but with 2 large 'family friendly' dining areas to the sides.  Real nice, inviting layout with booths and tables.  We've only been here a few times so far, but there is always a wide variety of people dining here, from young couples to large families with grandparents and kids in tow.  Another reason we specifically come here is because our daughter is a fussy eater like you wouldn't believe, who does not like to eat her veggies, but will when they are shredded and on her favorite taco!  My only minor gripe is that they don't have many interesting desserts here (I hope this changes), so we usually hit Mitchell's across the street for an ice cream sundae, in order to complete our gastronomical tour of Rocky River."}
{"text":"I've been there twice; once for lunch and once for dinner. Very cool atmosphere and staff. (There's something to be said about bartenders that hear your name once and remember it the entire visit.)  Great rum selection (try a flight) and excellent artisan tacos.   Will be hitting this place again for sure."}
{"text":"I enjoy Bomba as the laid back chill restaurant that it is.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating. The wide variety of tacos is fun to choose from.  This visit was more of a girls night so we just ordered guacamole and chips and salsa.   While the chip choices, plantains and more are exciting The flavors of the salsa and guacamole were bland and flavorless. I am not a salt lover but I find myself adding salt to their salsa and guacamole on every visit."}
{"text":"Everything was great!  I sat down at the bar and immediately the bartender introduced himself and remembered mine and my friend's name.  Every time he came over, he addressed us by name.  This level of service was awesome!  The crispy fish tacos were delicious and adding mango was awesome!  I was not a huge fan of the zucchini and black bean taco, but it was definitely edible.  The clementine mojito was delicious.  Overall, great environment, great service, good food."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday night and it was super meh, but I think it may have been because they were so busy.  We ordered margaritas and they were tiny with lots of ice.  And, there were only two choices of margaritas for the evening..it's like they took the extra flavoring off the menu for the weekend or something.  We got the fire roasted tomato salsa, which was good but lacked any heat.  We asked the waitress for hot sauce and she forgot about us and had to be reminded to bring it.  The guacamole tasted OLD!  Maybe it was a bunch of bad avocados, but yuck.  Even the addition of goat cheese and bacon couldn't save it.  We ordered a LOT of tacos:  CRISPY FISH jicama, mango, jalapeno remoulade--$3.00  RIO STYLE CHICKEN caramelized onions, poblano peppers, peanuts, cilantro aioli--$3.00  BEEF PICADILLO pico de gallo, chihuahua cheese, olives, key lime sour cream--$3.00  CHORIZO & POTATO goat cheese, smoky aioli--$3.00  ROASTED PORK AL PASTOR pickled onion & pineapple slaw, pickled jalapenos, balsamic aioli--$3.00  BLACKENED FISH pickled onion & pineapple slaw, cilantro aioli--$4.00  BRAISED BEEF queso fresco, pickled jalapenos, aji pepper aioli--$4.00  SMOKED BRISKET pickled onion, aji verde--$4.00  CRISPY AVOCADO pico de gallo, cilantro pesto--$4.00  SPICY SHRIMP chipotle sauce, aji verde, avocado--$4.00   The only one to write home about was the brisket.  Mark's spicy shrimp were super small and not so spicy.  Honestly, that was the problem to me.  It was like chi chis...very pedestrian with no heat.  Like a trendy taco place for the masses...which is working because they had a wait from 6-8 on a Saturday night that was epic.  I'd rather go to El Carnicero or Momocho or Barrio.  There, when they say spicy, they mean it.  ((They do have a cool app to watch yourself waiting in line when you are on the wait list.)) Thumbs up for technology!"}
{"text":"It took the bartender a solid ten minutes to greet us while we were the only people at the bar. Once she got there, she wasn't awful.  Drinks were good. Rum punch was pretry solid. Food was underwhelming both in flavor and portion size. If a friend asked me to meet them for drinks, i might go back. For food or service? Ha! No thanks."}
{"text":"Love this place! The mojitos are so delicious. I did not have the tacos but I hear they're amazing. I had The Cuban sandwich which was a really delicious. Also they have churros here!!!!! So good. The staff is super helpful and friendly. Also happy hour prices are pretty great!"}
{"text":"The Havana sandwich is incredible...not to mention the various rum flights! The guacamole is fresh and a must."}
{"text":"Great drinks - especially the mojito! I also liked the spicy shrimp taco but most of the other tacos I've tried have been a little runny and not as flavorful. Also skip the cheese dip - it's gross!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love Bomba, as I think it is a great addition to the Rocky River restaurant scene; however, it was simply OK for me. I went on a Monday night and it was not full, but relatively crowded which is great to see.   I went with two friends and to start we each got a drink: mango cilantro margarita, sangria, and the pomegranate ginger margarita. All of these drinks were decent.  We then got the chips and guac with added corn and pickled onions. The guac was pretty good, but nothing special.   Next, I opted for two tacos (rio style chicken and the crispy shrimp) and the yucca fries. I had read rave reviews of all 3 items. The crispy shrimp taco was the highlight for me. Both of the tacos (and those that my friends got) were presented in a messy way with cilantro and carrots spilling out over the edges. The real let-down for me was the yucca fries. There was way too much sauce for the 8 fries I got. These are big fries, but it was still way too much aioli. Not to mention that these are extremely over priced at $4.50 for 8 fries.   One of my friends also ordered wine and accidentally knocked over her nearly full glass. It was a complete accident (and only her second drink), and we used the napkins on the table to clean the mess as best as we could. The wine was all over our clothes, but the real travesty was that she now had an empty glass of wine. It was not replaced and she was still charged the full amount. I get that the spilling was our fault, but I think a half-pour to refill her glass would have been a nice gesture.  Overall, I'm hesitant to say if I'd choose to go back here. I hope to try it once more and have a better experience as I love the idea of this restaurant and I love Paladar (the counterpart restaurant on the east side)."}
{"text":"Phenomenal tacos! I had the crispy avocado, zucchini and black bean and the braised beef taco. All great! I can't tell you which one I loved more. With my dinner I had a watermelon basil mojito and then a pomegranate ginger margarita. I will absolutely be back! Probably my favorite taco place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Finally got in and was able to experience all the talk of the town!  Started with traditional guacamole with added bacon, or at least I think it was added! Nonetheless, it was great! But, for 4 people, it was not near enough! I basically ate it all! Chips and salsa typically with any Mexican restaurant is free. Nope not here! Tacos, fish taco my partner got he said was off the hook! (Great thing).  The crunchy shrimp taco, not so much, boring, dry and bland! Never again! BBQ pork, good decision! Plantains with the guacamole, so good! Baked plantains, out of this world! Spicy shrimp taco, DISGUSTING! Period! Drinks, lack of alcohol for the price. I thought I was drinking grape juice! Pricing $3 and $4 for tacos is a bit much for the size but someone has to pay the rent and employees. Which btw service, she was great!  One thing that I was not please with AT ALL, the floor slippery as snot! Being handicapped, yet can walk, slipping and sliding is not cool. Watched MANY people on the way to the restroom slip. Take care of that!  Unsure if I will be in any dire rush to come back but will because everyone we go out with loved it and overall it was good! 2 drinks (happy hour ended 1 min after I got there) 5 tacos, guacamole and a desert of some sort (cinnamon sticks that were nothing special) 60 bucks! Damn! Oh well! At least we got out of the house!"}
{"text":"It just wasn't all that great. I got two tacos, which where pretty good -- BBQ Chicken and Chorizo. I thought t he sauce on the chicken was too sweet, but that is sort of a me thing. I also ordered the queso and chips. The queso was really weirdly seasoned and the chips/plantains/whatever else they threw in there tasted stale. The service was also very slow, especially considered we were in there on a weeknight and the place was far from full. Overall this place gets a \" probably never again\" from me."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time. Everything was great. I loved the atmosphere, the food and the service was extremely good. I had the Bomba Bowl and it was fabulous. I will be coming back here with friends."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant! Delicious food, reasonable prices, and great service! I wanted Barrio for dinner and it was too busy so we decided to try this place. I can say I probably won't go to Barrio anymore because Bomba is WAY better! They don't have a create-your-own taco menu, but the ones they offer are delicious and you can create your own guac! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Exactly what Yelp says 3 stars is: \"A-OK\"  Came for lunch and our waitress asked if we'd ever been there before. Saying no, she described the food as \"Mexican and stuff.\"  This wasn't Mexican - much closer to Cuban, given the plantains, black beans, and Havana sandwich on the menu and the Buena Vista Social Club on the radio. Especially, with the extensive rum menu and flights (not tequila!), the description should be the same as the parent company, Paladar, as a \"Latin Kitchen.\" A more knowledgeable description from the waitress would have been more respectful instead of distilling down any place with tacos as \"Mexican.\"  We started with a salsa - the mint tamatillo. Very unique and I enjoyed that it came with diverse plantain, yucca, corn tortilla etc. chips. It was a reasonable price of $3.5. I saw a few people order the guac; while the mix-ins seemed interesting, the price of ~$7 for the portion size I saw didn't seem that worth it.  My friend and I both ordered their well-priced lunch deal: $10 for 3 tacos. Their taco menu is extensive and diverse. I ordered the lamb barbacoa, duck, and crispy shrimp. I wish the execution of the tacos was a little better. All three tacos had the salsas/creamy sauces on the bottom of the taco, making the tortillas very soggy. This also caused the salsa to drip from the taco I was eating onto the other tacos, disrupting the different flavor profiles. An easy fix would be to put the salsas on top. The barbacoa and duck tacos were okay - not as moist as I would expect for two types of cuts of meat that run on the fattier side. The crispy shrimp was delicious though and I would highly recommend if they could just put the salsa on top.   Also worth noting is that all three tacos were generously portioned with what tasted to me in-house pickled jalapenos, just in case you aren't a jalapeno person! There was also pickled jicama that was delicious. Finally, the corn-flour \"fusion\" tortillas were nothing to write home about, but if I came again I may order the corn tortillas to see if they are more sturdy.   As a side, I ordered plantains: yum!  Service was okay, our server was clearly at her first job and it showed. Aside from her opening introduction that rubbed me the wrong way, it was nothing to write home about.  I'd recommend this place when deals are going on: happy hour, lunch. But seeing the slightly-off execution, I think I'd wait until I see the food improve before I put down money for a full-price dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing. I had 3 tacos. A kale and corn taco, a corn and zucchini taco, and a crunchy fish taco. 3 bucks a taco. Very affordable. VERY delicious."}
{"text":"The food is fresh snd the atmosphere is fun. Bomba's got a young, hip vibe with colorful decor and fun music. The tacos are delicious and I personally think their guacamole is one of the best I've ever tasted. I love it with bacon and queso fresco. Everything tastes very fresh and light. Their lunch specials are the best. 3 tacos and a side for $9.95. Who can beat that?!"}
{"text":"Drove over 70 miles just to come back to Bomba Cuz my fiance and I missed it so much! Service was fantastic as usual (thanks Jessica!). And the manager was personable and visited everyone in the restaurant. They made us feel special. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First time at Bomba Tacos and was really excited to try it. Our service was great.. our waitress was busy and attentive and very knowledgeable. We started off with the classic guacamole and added corn and a salsa. The guac was amazing and the chips that came with it was so good! whole grain and plantains. YUM, The salsa was not good.. we got the fire roasted tomato one.. literally tasted like fire roasted tomatoes out of a can. We also ordered a snack of popcorn- it was okay.. tasted just like regualr kettle corn with some seasoning.. not worth $4.  We each got 4 tacos.. i got the chicken rio, pork, and braised beef.. they were all different and delish but nothing to brag about.  Overall they have a diverse menu and the food is okay.. but everything was just 'Okay'."}
{"text":"Best \"Mexican\" in Lakewood / Rocky River! Amazing atmosphere, very chic and romantic. Great variety in the menu and lots of solid vegan options. Drink menu is out of control! Service is always consistent which I appreciate, in the summer they have a cool open patio."}
{"text":"I've been to Bomba twice and I have to say it's a pretty nice experience. If I had one complaint it would be the amount of liquid in the tacos. You can't eat them without a waterfall of something cascading down the opposite side. It can also make for soggy taco bottoms. Aside from that, the tacos are pretty good, not too bad on price and the drinks are tasty as well. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Loved all 12 tacos I've eaten there in the past 3 weeks, tried at least 8 distinct choices and they were all great. Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"There are a few things a restaurant must do right in order to get a five star review from me.  First and foremost, their food has to be fresh and delicious.  Next, good beer, including craft beers are becoming a must, at least in Cleveland.  Finally, service has to be spot on.  Bomba Tacos & Rum gets this all right.  The location is in a wealthy neighborhood with a few expensive cars in the parking lot.  The crowd was mixed in age ranging from 30 somethings to 50 and 60 somethings.  The joint was packed, but we only waited three minutes for a table.  Once seated by the knockout hostess, our waiter approached and poured us glasses of water.  He then left a bottle of filtered water on the table for us to drink, which was nice.  Since the water had no flavor at all, I know it was filtered using a reverse osmosis process.  I'm sort of a water snob.  Anyway, I perused the beer menu and saw not one, but three craft wheat ales - my favorite.  By the end of the night, I will have finished two of the three, both of which were yummy.  I started with a Breckenridge Agave Wheat ale, which was delicious, followed by a Boulavard, 80 acre, which had a bit more of a hoppy flavor.  I preferred the Breckenridge, as it was smoother.  Great beer!  My wife spotted ceviche on her menu and immediately extended her arm, hand, and index finger over to my menu to emphatically indicate the presence of the lemony, raw fish appetizer.  Naturally, she ordered it, along with the mojo pork tostones.    Our drinks arrived and then the apps arrived.  The beer was delish, as expected.  My wife's mango sangria was also very delicious.  We shared everything, so I tasted a lot of stuff on this visit.    Then our appetizers arrived.  The ceviche was excellent.  It was fresh, lemony, tasty, and it had a good texture.  It is on par with the best ceviches a guy from Parma has ever had.  Hey!  At least I qualified it.  The mojo pork tostones were of very good quality, had a very deep flavor and my wife loved em.  I just liked em - didn't love em.  I would recommend them, however.  At this point in the meal, the wife and I were very impressed.  Our hope was that the entrees would be equally well prepared and tasty.  As the apps arrived, we placed our dinner orders.    Just as we finished the apps, the entrees arrived.  My three tacos looked pretty mouthwatering (see my photos)!  They were stuffed with fresh ingredients, seafood, and mushrooms.  I ordered a chipotle mushroom taco, which was of very good quality and taste, but was my least favorite of the three.  The next taco was the blackened fish.  This taco was served with a nice piece of fresh, well cooked fish laying across the top.  Visually, it was stunning.  It had a great texture, a little crunch from the veggies, and was probably the best fish taco I've ever eaten.  Loved every bite of it.  Next, the crispy shrimp taco had approximately four pieces of tasty, deep fried shrimp on it.  This was my favorite taco of the three.  It had a great crunch, a nice sauce, and a spicy kick from few jalapenos.  I loved my tacos and I WILL RETURN FOR MORE.  I ordered the yucca fries with aioli, which were delicious!  Must try!  Where have you been all my life, Bomba's?  I love it, love it!"}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying that Jack Sparrow himself would give this place two thumbs up (well, two hands up holding half empty bottles of rum, lets be real).  Bomba is a wonderful and unique addition to CLE - and would be such for the rum and cocktails alone, not to mention the great food and atmosphere.   To start, the ambiance of the place is very colorful, fun, and chill - very Caribbean.  The wait staff is super nice and very helpful as well, especially regarding drink suggestions.  And oh man, the drinks here are delish! Very flavorful and refreshing.  From the jalapeño cocktail to the mango-cilantro mojito and the finishing Rum Punch, each was amazing and complimented the food well.  I look forward to coming back and trying their Rum flights (which seem like a great Happy Hour special at $5 off - holla!)   The food was also great: varied taco selections such as duck, crispy shrimp, blackened fish, kale+sweet potato - something for everyone. Each taco I had was very flavorful and awesome, the crispy shrimp being my favorite.  Now, an aspect that really excites me about this joint are their tortas.  Going to college in Arizona, I fell in love with these exotic and savory Latin American sandwiches but had not yet come across them in Ohio.  Oh Bomba, thank you for changing that!    All in all, this place is most perfect (in my opinion) for a chill happy hour spent with friends (and many tacos and drinks) at their really cool bar.  A Most Excellent spot indeed. Party on, Bomba."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here. From the tacos to the drinks to the service. Also they have plantains which I have a soft spot for. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"If you have never had any real deal tacos, then you may think these are good. All the braised meats obviously got no browning or char, and just taste like poached gray meats. When pork and duck can barely be distinguished your chef really needs to look in the mirror. Drown in wet sauces and the buried under the pickled kitchen sink, truly there is no hope for the meats to speak up. Guacamole was fresh but not seasoned, you can barely taste salt or lime juice. Bland city. If you are going to rip off the Latin cuisine, my god at least learn what is the soul if this food. Mediocre gringo bar food at best, with too many inappropriate add ins.   It's a shame since the drinks are good, the place looks nice, staff is friendly, but the food is a huge miss."}
{"text":"Tacos are ok, super expensive for the concept."}
{"text":"It was father's day so I got to choose where we ate last night. I wanted to go somewhere we have never been before and I didn't want something too heavy so we decided to take a trip down Detroit and behold Bomba Tacos & Rum. I've been reading through articles online, by word of mouth and just from being close to Rocky River that this place was a must try. Bomba is a sister restaurant of Paladar Latin Kitchen which is on the east side of Cleveland (also my boss's favorite spot to eat). We've heard from friends that the wait is usually long (probably due to being a new restaurant) but we were seated immediately upon arrival. The restaurant décor is quite the sight to see. The bar is beautiful, it's very clean and it has a modern touch, I was very impressed. I also enjoyed how it wasn't cramped and there was an outside patio (although small).   We looked over the menu while we waited for our server (who was very accommodating and attentive). We ordered some drinks for us including a traditional margarita; not my favorite (it wasn't sweet enough and it was NOT cold which made it hard to drink for me personally) and a glass of Bacardi Dragon Berry (which we did enjoy). Even with the disappointment of the margarita they did have a stellar list of drinks and I plan on trying the Jamaican Mule next time.     The menu has a list of pre-made tacos (lots of variety, with beef, poultry, veggie, pork and fish), sandwiches, tortas and a few specialties from Paladar. We opted to start with the traditional guacamole with a mango add-in (50 cents more). I'll say it wasn't the best guacamole I have ever had but it was still fresh, tasty and seasoned well. The guacamole comes served with a variety of chips (yucca, plantain, Malanga & corn) which was a GREAT touch; I very much enjoyed all of the options.   Now to our entrees, which were fabulous. Our 3 year old got a large serving of chicken quesadilla (3 half tortillas) which he very much enjoyed, as did I when I had a bite. My girlfriend and I opted for the tacos which range between $3-$4. She went with the 'Grilled Sweet Potato' and 'Roasted Pork' tacos. I wasn't fond of the sweet potato one but she enjoyed it and the Roasted Pork option was probably the best taco of the night. I wanted to try the 'Chicken Tinga' which they were out of unfortunately, so I went with the 'Chorizo & Potato' and 'Rio Style Chicken'. The chorizo was not in crumble form which I am used to but it was pleasantly seasoned and delicious. I really liked my Rio Chicken option with the peppers and onions and I would get that one next time for sure. The tacos were on the smaller side but very flavorful and I think I will order 3 next time (the menu recommends 3-4 tacos a person).   Bomba Tacos & Rum is a great addition to the Cleveland West Side. The tacos were flavorful, the service was on point and the freshness of not only the food but the décor make this place a great option for any kind of occasion. We will be back to enjoy again very soon!"}
{"text":"Two things I love about this place: the patio and the kale tacos.    The patio is perfect for Cleveland summers.  Sit near the doors and you can forget the parking lot (sorta).   The kale taco is spectacular.  I have tried all the veggie tacos on the menu and waffled between this and the sweet potato, but this is the clear winner for me.  It is worth coming here just for those tacos.  There is a customized guac you can get also.  It is decent.  The fun thing with this guac is the chips.  They are different root vegetables instead of the typical corn tortilla.     We will continue to comeback over and over.  I am looking forward to summer again."}
{"text":"I was really excited to hear that the owners of Paladar were opening a restaurant on the west side but unfortunately the restaurant is not in the same league. We went for an early dinner so the place was not crowded but service was terrible. We waited for about 15-20 minutes for a waitress to acknowledge us.   I watched people on the other side of us come in after us get their drinks so I went and said something to one of the hostesses. Then we had someone come over to get our drink order but no apology for the wait.  The mojito was okay not as good as the ones I have had at Paladar. We asked for water and were given a bottle of warm water and glasses. Since the waitress never came back until after we had finished our meal I couldn't ask for a glass of ice.  A server brought our meal and left quickly - I had wanted some hot sauce and my husband wanted another beer but we couldn't locate a waitress/waiter.   The food was okay. I had three tacos - bbq pork, chicken tinga, and spicy shrimp. The pork and chicken were great with nice seasoning. The spicy shrimp was not spicy and the shrimp was rubbery. My husband had the fish, chorizo and potato, crispy avocado, and beef taco - he liked them all especially the chorizo and potato.   The music playing was fairly loud and at times I couldn't hear my husband.  When I went to use the restrooms there was no TP in the double roll dispenser - a real issue not keeping the restrooms clean or refilling TP.  I thought the prices were high for what you get - tacos are small (price range $3-4). All sides are extra ($3.50-4.50).    I will be driving over to Paladar and don't think I will make a return trip - very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Great food and guacamole!  The chef has put together a wonderful menu and I like the atmosphere of the place.  I also hired their taco truck for a backyard event and the staff prepared food onsite and served to my guests.  Nice people and great service.  Everybody raved about it."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, rice bowls, apps and drinks. Josephine was our waitress and she was excellent! Super fast and friendly, will definitely be back for her!"}
{"text":"Great first experience at Bombas! Our waitress was Alexis and she was fun , knew the menu and adorable! Also the general manager Tony who came from El Carnicero works there and is a great addition to the place. Keeping this short as possible I had the blackened fish (dynamite!) and the Rio Style Chicken also delish. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband & I came in for lunch and had excellent service, food, and drinks. The server took time to even explain the type of cuisine they were serving. I love they serve individual filtered glass bottled water to your table. Also the price was reasonable for the lunch we had. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Last night was our first visit and both my hubby and I were impressed.  We were with friends, and because of that, we were able to call ahead for seating. They texted back when a table was available.  Being a Friday night, they were extremely busy! The call ahead seating was a nice feature.  Our waiter spent a great deal of time with us, explaining the menu and offering suggestions.  My dietary requirements are such that I cannot have tomatoes, citrus, and spicy things.  They were able to accommodate me graciously! Never in my life did I think I would order fish tacos. But last night I did and they were absolutely delicious! I am still dreaming about the side dish of rice and mango and coconut.  I can't wait to have that again!  Not only was my food perfectly prepared, but my drink was as well. Not being able to have lime, they left that out of my Mojito.  It tasted just like a mint julep for me which is one of my preferred beverages. When we ordered a second round, they remembered the way I liked it. I was one happy girl!  I have to admit it was a little on the noisy side being so busy. That made it difficult to talk with our friends but we enjoyed the experience nonetheless and look forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"I'm very much enjoying Paladar's more casual sister restaurant.  The prices are reasonable and the tacos, especially, are really tasty!  We ordered some salsa to start that comes with a mixture of plantain, yucca and tortilla chips.  Definitely more interesting than just tortillas! The salsa was interesting and delicious, too! I went with the two version of shrimp tacos (crispy and spicy) on the menu (they all get ordered individually so you can mix and match) -- mine were both SO GOOD.  Good choices and I may not ever try anything else.   We also had a pitcher of sangria that was very boozy and the perfect match for the salsa and tacos.  Overall, I'm pretty impressed and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decent tacos, but it took quite a while for them to make it to the table. The food was okay, but nothing as good as what you can get at a certain other taco establishment in Cleveland that also starts with a B. I went a year ago to try it out, but haven't felt any urge to go back when there are so many other tacos to be eaten elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm really hoping this was an off night, but it was not a good experience....The service was extremely slow - half an hour to take a drink order - food order took forever and most of it was cold.   The metal pans they serve tacos in weren't heated and drained the heat from the tacos.  I personally felt the food was over-seasoned and my marguarita (requested light salt) was unbelievably salty.  At the end of the meal, the hostess came by an apologized and offered a gift card, which we declined.  Won't be returning there anytime soon!  There are too many other excellent restaurants in the area to repeat that experience!"}
{"text":"I had a friend in town for the holidays and she was in the mood for Mexican. We were deciding between Bomba and that other taco place in town...something new or something tried and true. I read a bunch of reviews on Bomba and we ultimately picked that other taco place in town...because queso. It was an hour long wait and we called over at Bomba to see if the holiday crowds were too much. They told us there was no wait, so we went on over. We were seated right away and got to visit and talk to each other at normal volumes.  While the service was a bit slow and they were out of a few things because they were busier than normal, we were so pleased with our choice. Between 4 of us, we ordered 6-7 different cocktails and my cocktail connoisseur Vegas friends were thrilled with the Jalapeno Paloma, red sangria, Jamaican Mule, and Lavendar Bees Knees. We order the guacamole and the salsa verde - which were amazing! Not only was the salsa verde very unique with a good mint kick, but we were all so happy with the yucca, plantain, and corn chip mix. We also got some yucca fries which came breaded with a very good garlic aioli. We each tried two different tacos - braised duck, chicken tinga, BBQ pork, crispy shrimp, and classic beef - all fantastic!  Definitely somewhere I would go again!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Service was extremely slow. Need female bartenders, the men are rude, especially to women. Food is bland and meat is dry. Queso is NOT queso dip. It's weird \"stretchy cheese\" as our server called it.  They seat you out of order. When I was there, two people had to complain about the same issue. Hostess said \"oops I didn't mean to\".   Most likely will not be back."}
{"text":"The tacos were small and overpriced. Although they tasted good, I personally am not a fan of cabbage on a taco and every taco is served that way. I had a chicken, chorizo And fried shrimp, and the shrimp was the only one I would never get again. I enjoyed the meal, atmosphere was good, place was clean. I also don't like the use of runners to deliver the food to the table. My drink was empty and was never offered a another. Overpriced, under serviced. Save a buck and stick to the happy hour times.  I was contacted by a \"manager\" about my experience. I will stick to my earlier review and reiterate that it is overpriced and under serviced. Restaurants should take notice: DO NOT deliver my food with a runner who needs to ask who ordered what. The wait staff who took my order should deliver or in the case of a runner if the order is clockwise that's where the food goes. Step up your professionalism if you are overcharging for your food.     This here begins my vendetta against runners and put the food back on the waiter.   Then I will be able to order a refill of my empty drink due to your inattentive service."}
{"text":"I love tacos, so I really wanted to love Bomba, but I just can't. We've visited Bomba a total of three times, and every time the service has been painfully slow - even when they weren't very busy. Just recently when we went, our entrees actually came out before our appetizers. The food quality is subpar. There's nothing awful about it, but nothing truly great either. I find their menu to be overpriced for the quality of their dishes. It almost has a generic chain restaurant feel to it.  I will admit that I love their plantain chips, though. I wish them luck, and I'm sure they'll do well due to the location that they are in. We, however, will not be future patrons."}
{"text":"What a delightful place!  The range of taco options is astounding and delightful.  I had one of the lamb tacos and a mushroom taco - both were simply delicious!  Bomba is a great addition to the restaurant scene in our area.  We will be regulars!"}
{"text":"Strong drinks and a great selection of tasty tacos. I have not yet tried a rice bowl but look forward to a carne asada rice bowl on my next visit. Serving staff at the bar was busy but attentive. We will return."}
{"text":"They were PACKED - hour and a half wait - and yet once we sat down, everything was perfectly timely! And the service was fantastic at the bar. If day two was any indication of how this place will be run, they do an awesome job!!  The Guac (we picked mango, bacon & pepitos) was great - the homemade plantain, yuca, and tortilla chips were great - the queso fundido w/ chorizo was great - the Tinga Taco was THE BEST. I wasn't impressed with the crunchy shrimp taco (not much flavor) or the avocado taco (Orale's Negra Modelo Battered Avocado Tacos have spoiled me).   Their original margarita is on the sweet side, but well concocted. Theirs are golden - orange liqueur included - which is a plus for me.  All in all, we had a really good experience here and will be back for sure. With so many fantastic options in the area for tacos (el Carnicero, Barrio, Orale...), it's hard to give this place a fair rating, but I think based on my one experience, they're definitely worth adding to the rotation."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get upscale, modern Mexican. Really, I think it's closer to 4.5 stars.  I've visited on a few different occasions and each experience was consistent in the great service and quality of the food. The overall look of the restaurant has great decor as well.  If you go, and you really should, try to get there during happy hour. The drink prices are well worth it. I've tried margaritas, mojitos and sangria. Honestly, I don't know which is my favorite because they are all SO good!   The food itself is also pretty great. I've tried many of the tacos, meat and vegetarian, and all were delicious. At first, when they come to you, they don't look very big, but they are definitely filling, especially if you get some of the tasty chips and salsa beforehand. The yucca fries are also nice as a side.   There were two reasons I didn't give it a full five stars. First, the rice. It was very bland and had no flavor. Second, the guacamole prices are a little too high when you have to keep adding ingredients, and the base guacamole is just ok. It too needs a little more seasoning as it was kind of bland. But these are by no means a deal breaker.  Great job, Bomba!"}
{"text":"Really wish I could have stretched to five stars... But... Stopped for Sunday brunch around noon.  The place wasn't busy and we were thrilled (as we tote a toddler these days).  The food was *almost* outstanding, but it didn't make it to our table hot.  Lukewarm, at best.  Still tasty, and no opportune times to flag our gal down for a quick reheat; she was pretty MIA.  We ordered one taco to try out post-brunch meal, and had to remind her about it.  When it came, yes, alas... Cold.  But tasty.  Hard to get a coffee refill, and she passed a few times at the end of our meal (check processing), I would have loved a bit extra, but again... No.  We got a flan to go, but next time would likely stick to the entrées.  Wasn't that great.  Overcooked and over-eggy, with no caramel or coconut on my pallet, per the description.  I could maybe be tempted by a churro in the right moment, if we venture again.  Overall: tasty!  Service: Friendly but inattentive."}
{"text":"Ive been to Bomba about 6 times already. And i haven't been let down yet. New fav spot on the westside. Rum flights are a great thing to try out. Those alone, have made me start to like rum again. I never used to like rum. But now I'm coming around to the good stuff. Thanks BOMBA!  IMO, the best tacos I've had in CLE. perfect size, packed with flavor! my favorites are the lamb and al pastor. Fire roasted tomato salsa and guac with goat cheese are my favorite dippers. You should note that the quest fundido is not like your typical tex mex cheese dip. Bomba's fundido is more solid than saucy. Delicious non-the-less!   I am a big fan of their margaritas. They go down very nicely. Their house mix is a little on the salty end. Last time i was in the salt on the rim was a little to much for me to handle and had to work around it. Even more so the rum drinks are what you want to get when you are there. I've had prob half of them and i fully enjoyed them all. wouldn't recommend going to get beer there, a little on the pricey end, $5 for a corona is steep no matter where I'm at (including white table cloths). and as far as i know beer isn't included in their happy hour, which includes $5 margs and $5 off rum flights the latter is probably the best deal IMO. Not a bad HH.  Service has been exceptional. I have had the pleasure of having Tim wait on me and my company several times and he has been wonderful. Never forgets about my party. Very attentive. Big reason to go back. Thanks Tim.  Hostess' didn't seem to have a wait time algorithm."}
{"text":"So delicious! This is my first time here and I am very impressed! Our waitress Amanda l. Was very helpful and explained the menu well and answered our million questions. The tacos were amazing. The roasted pork el pastor was my best pick. So flavorful! I was also impressed with the unique jalapeño paloma. Spicy and refreshing! I think this is going to be one of my new favorite places!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Bomba! I've been trying to get here for a while and we finally found some time. Came on a Friday around 6pm. It was still happy hour!  We started with the premium aged rum flight. $5 off. Came with 3 shot glasses. They were all really smooth and delicious. I especially like the 23 year aged rum. So so smooth.   Then we had the queso fundido and some roasted red pepper salsa & chips The queso was hot cheese in a plate and it came with some corn tortillas. It was a nice change from the typical \"queso\" dip. We also had an order of the Fire Roasted Tomato salsa. The salsa had a really nice flavor! I also liked that it came out with all sorts of different chips. I especially liked the plantain chips paired with the salsa.   For dinner the hubs and I shared 6 of the tacos. Some were better than others. I will mention the best first: Braised beef, Lamb Barbacoa, and Sweet Potato. In the middle was the blackened fish. On the bottom were the mushroom and the chicken. [ahh! I cannot remember which chicken one we had! sorry! -- just order the Lamb, you won't be sorry]  With the apps, the 6 tacos was probably a bit (read: I was STUFFED) too much food for two, but we really just wanted to try them all! I think we could have gone with only 3 or 4 total tacos.  The service was good, even during Friday Happy Hour and the atmosphere was the bomb(a)! I really enjoyed sitting on the covered patio with the breeze coming in. Very nice.   So, overall I will definitely be back. Fun place, good rum, close to home, and the food hold it's own for sure. I'd like to try a few different things on the menu including the guac and some of the other flavors of salsa."}
{"text":"Fresh guacamole of course got two separate kinds. Guac with corn and guac with goat cheese and bacon. Both very good and satisfying. Really enjoyed the homemade chips. My boyfriend got four tacos; brisket, duck, roasted chicken and spicy shrimp. All four he enjoyed and was pleasantly surprised he enjoyed all the ingredients.  I got roasted chicken empanadas and three tacos. Brisket, crispy avocado and blackened fish. All very good and fresh.  Why three stars if food was fresh and very good? Well Our server was annoying and killed the experience. His (Kurt) personality was laid back (which if no big deal) but has the high as kite surfer attitude/lingo that we found annoying. We spent with tip $74, wish we had less annoying service for the price we paid."}
{"text":"Went on a packed day long 45 minute wait!  It was a ok experience I still prefer the paladar over this place food seemed rushed and not as tasty as paladar, my mango rice wasn't nothing to brag about and tacos were just ok , all in all ok experience can't go wrong with the guacamole"}
{"text":"I've never had anything bad at this restaurant, however, the most memorable thing I have gotten there has been the guacamole add goat cheese..."}
