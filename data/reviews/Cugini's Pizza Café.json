{"text":"I've been on the quest for Montreal's best pizza for years..... there have been a few contenders along the way, but always a little something here or a little something there that would make it better.
There is NOTHING that would make Germano's pizza better.
There is no other place in my experience where you can feel the snap of the crust when you bite into it. It's so crisp that you hold up a giant New York style slice and the pizza holds up beautifully. You can literally knock on the bottom of it, it's that level of crispy.  He does have a secret to making it.. and that secret involves a lot of time and produces a healthier product.  There are no shortcuts to making an excellent product and this is embraced at Cugini's.
This is a pizza that will allow you to leave completely satisfied without feeling full or bloated. Germano's philosophy comes straight from Italy - pizza should be nutritious, not junky. His ingredients are always fresh, because he'll only buy them if they are. He cuts everything himself, everything made to order.  That's love, that's passion... and you can taste it in every bite. 
The restaurant itself is like all the great ones. Tiny but cozy, a little off the beaten track.  And I think he likes it that way..... it means that the people who take the time to go are the people who will appreciate the experience they are going to have. Cugini's feels like nonna's kitchen.... the one the whole family squishes into every Sunday to gather around the table and share. The one that always keeps you coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent top quality pizza. The crust was thin and not soggy. Fresh sauce and great toppings. 
I recommend The Beaconsfield and the Chef Special."}
{"text":"I headed to Cugini's *really* wanting to love it since the West Island has been, alas, a bit of a wasteland in terms of quality pizza joints for a while now.  Heck, the island of Montreal as a whole could do a lot better in general, but I digress.  Most places in the area have the thick dough and greasy toppings that fill you up on a budget, and I was quite hopeful Cugini's was going to be a breath of fresh air and a bite of fresh pie after having read some online chatter about the chef/owner, Germano, featuring a \"New York-style\" pizza at his establishment after returning home from having worked in Brooklyn for several years.

Well, having enjoyed several transcendent slices in the Big Apple and the boroughs at spots like Co., Lucali, and others, I'd say he comes close... but there's still some definite room for improvement.

On a positive note, the ingredients at Cugini's are good.  Great, even.  The toppings are fresh, relatively innovative, and unlike the run-of-the-mill presliced pepperoni-in-a-bag that goes onto 95% of the other pies in the West Island.  The crust is superior.  Germano himself will come out, introduce himself, talk to you, and solicit feedback, and it's clear that this is a passionate chef who is very proud of his business and product.  So from a customer service standpoint I would also say \"A1.\"

On the flip side, as good as those ingredients are, in my view, there simply aren't enough of them, especially on thinner-crusted pizza that runs in the $17 range for a 12\" or up to $26 for a 16\".  Now granted, for gourmet - though in this case, \"artisanal\" may be more apt, since the toppings are not particularly extravagant - pizza I would expect to pay more, and potentially get a less \"weighty\" or \"doughy\" crust than your standard joint.  But... I would also expect to get something of substance in every bite, and in the pies I've had at Cugini's to date, that hasn't been the case.  The dough is flavorful and has a nice crisp and chew to it, but all too frequently that is all you are biting into, along with whatever the sauce may be.  Meats, cheeses, and veg are more judiciously distributed as toppings, and just don't cover enough of the pizza as a whole.

I was on the fence between three stars or four as a rating here, but am posting four because Cugini's and its owner deserve a chance to thrive, so I would encourage you to give it a shot if you haven't yet.  The West Island needs more original pizza spots, so for the moment let's hope Cugini's can evolve, get into the black once startup costs are covered, then sink some profits back into sourcing more generous toppings on its star products."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant. The chef and his team prepare everything by hand. What a beautiful change from the heavy over burdened cheese pizzas. Ingredients fresh, the chef is super creative, engaged to his business and goes beyond to make sure his clients are happy. Bonus, you can bring your own wine. A lovely warm experience. Eating in his restaurant feels like a warm hug. This is a definite down to earth experience that I want to return to again and again....  I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I was mezmerized by this place and I will find a reason to come back. This is not an area I know and was looking for a place for a quick bite to eat. It is located in an unasuming little strip mall. The place is very welcoming and beautifuly decorated with inspirational saying painted on the wall. The staff greated me with a beautiful smile and helped me make a quick choice. I opted for the italian sausage panini with house salad. It was so delicious and ready in no time. The ingreadient where fresh and flavourful cooked and assembled to perfection."}
{"text":"For those who crave a Gema-like end result without the \"I'm sitting in my car on the 40 on a Sunday just to go get a slice, is something wrong with me?\" experience, there is now a Holy Grail of real Neapolitan pizza in the West Island.

From the moment you walk into the casual, if not tiny, eatery, you are greeted by a tall, somewhat imposing, but extremely warm and welcoming gentleman by the name of Germano. My new friend pours his heart and soul into everything he does within those 4 walls at Cugini's Pizza Cafe.

From the antipasto board, to the incredibly fresh ingredients topping the slow cooked sauce atop a crispy pizza crust, to the heavenly Nodini (pastries topped with Nutella, honey and powdered sugar)...you can taste the love in every bite. I've sampled 4 different pizzas from the menu and they are all equally delicious. 

If you are looking for Quality, and are willing to pay a little more for a great pizza, you will never be disappointed by Cugini's. Just don't expect him to rush your order or give you the cold shoulder, because Germano's warmth and true love for his craft will make you want to stay and chat for a while as your pizza cooks to perfection within his ovens.

You owe it to yourself to try Cugini's and I guarantee you will become a regular, just like me."}
{"text":"Tried Cuginni's for the first time the other night. At the advice of Eater Montreal who recommended it in their top spots to eat in the West Island, I was going into this pretty pumped and hungry.

The place is relatively small but has terrasse seating outside when weather permits! That night, the place was packed with a big group and the rest with a few couples, though we luckily nabbed a spot and didn't have to wait. The ambiance is pretty good with a dimly lit room, and candles at tables, but don't expect fancy tablecloths, it stays true to its café title. Although tablecloths would have added to the charm.

The waitress was cute and friendly and took our drink order right away. We took two Diet Pepsi cans and had brought our own bottle of wine for the dinner. Yes folks, it's a BYOB, which as a wine lover, already wins it some big points. On the menu are a variety of pizzas, two salad options, two panini options, calzone, and deserts. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have simple and fun appetizers like gnocchi rosé, burratta and tomato, bruschetta, calamari, arrancinni, or house/Caesar salads to munch on as we drink our wine. Nevertheless, we ordered a large 16 inch pizza, their most extravagant of course! We noticed that they didn't serve pasta on the menu yet on the back they were selling their pasta sauce, so we asked our waitress why their wasn't any on the menu and she said it's in the works.

So some time passed and we're talking amongst ourselves when the waitress seems to be passing out dishes at tables. She finally comes over to ours and drops off a decent sharing portion of penne tomato sauce, which she said was a house treat that night. Let me tell you, it not only looked delicious, it was my favourite part of the entire meal! The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sauce being their traditional tomato was authentic and downright delicious. Let's hope they get that on the menu soon, even as a starter.

It wasn't long after finishing our pasta dish that the owner and Chef came into the room from the back to introduce himself. But it wasn't only a simple hello, he sat down with us and chatted for probably a good 5 minutes. I was pretty impressed at the friendliness and genuine interest he seemed to be taking in our experience at his restaurant. He would swing by twice more throughout the meal to check on us.

So more time went by, setting the pace for a prolonged dinner, luckily we had our wine! But our pizza did come out on a stand and boy did it look good. It was a 16\" tomato sauce pizza, topped with Romano cheese, arugula, roasted red peppers, boccacini ( which I would've expected a bit more), and a balsamic drizzle to top it all off. It was perhaps the best thin crust pizza I have ever had and I used to work in a wood oven pizza place in Montreal. The crust underneath that is usually slightly burnt or soggy, was absolute perfection, a result the owner claims is a product of his dough. What I found particularly interesting was that everything they serve is bought fresh that day, placing an emphasis on absolute quality products. 

After finishing the pizza, we polished off the wine, and decided to try some desserts. They had two options, both Nutella based, being the Nutella pizza or these Nutella drizzled honey donuts, we opted for the latter. I will say that I was hoping for a traditional cannoli but they don't seem to serve any. When the dessert came out it smelt prefect with that cinnamon and honey and Nutella soft doughy donut smell! It was delicious, although I would added a Nutella drizzle over them before serving. 

All in all we spent two hours at this pizza byob café in the west island, and watched the day turn into night. Did it live up to the hype? I'd definitely say it's worth a trip and I plan on coming back, there were a few pizzas I wanted to try and hopefully there could be an addition or two to the menu, here keeping my fingers crossed. The menu is above average priced, but for quality ingredients and savings from byob, you can't really go wrong. 4 stars for now! Until next time."}
{"text":"First time visited but definitely not my last! Fabulous pizzas and garlic knots with marinara sauce on side fir dipping (appetizer).  Wow one of the Best pizzas I have tried -thin crust, fresh vegetables and amazing tasting sauce!  Definitely need to try if you have not yet! Great friendly  service ! Bon appetit"}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas and was not impressed. I find it very expensive for such small pizzas with basic ingredients. La Toscana was better than the 3 cheese one which was basic, not much cheese and dry. I'm sure there is better pizza in the west island."}
{"text":"Endroit très sympathique.  Propriétaire fier et accueillant.  Cuisine avec produits frais et santé .  Idéal pour un beau dimanche soir, sinon, il faut réserver.
Merci pour votre accueil et votre bonne pizza!"}
{"text":"Had a take-out pizza; with arugula, bocconcini and roasted red peppers. All the ingredients were fresh and tasty. The dough was perfectly cooked. Sprinkled with good quality balsamic vinegar. All in all a delicious pizza.Certainly will go back again and again."}
