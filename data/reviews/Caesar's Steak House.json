{"text":"I have been in this long-standing \"Class of Calgary\" establishment a few times, but it is always a treat to bring someone, in this case my Yorkshire Babe, who has never experienced this kind of dining. 

The unassuming location of Willow Park Village hides this gem of a restaurant. Once you enter, you forget that you are in a strip mall. Right from the moment you check your coat to being seated near the brazier, the level of service is exceptional. You will immediately notice that there are no \"kids\" on the wait staff.

After perusing the wine list, settling on a mid-priced Malbec, I gazed into my dining Babe's eyes and then was immediately distracted by the chef seasoning then laying several choice cuts of beef on the grill. So much for the romance! 

I already knew what I was ordering for us before we got there: Caesar Salad for Deux made tableside (waiters have a great rivalry for who makes the best dressing from scratch), Chateaubriand for Deux and for dessert.....wait for it......nothing! Too damn full of amazing beef, stuffed potato and grilled veggies! Oh and I would be remiss to forget the incredible garlic toast of which  two versions are served - cheese and straight-up. We did enjoy a half litre of the same Malbec mid meal as well.

There is nothing to say but try this place if you have never been. Or as the other reviewers likely do: visit again!"}
{"text":"Had my first (and last) visit to Caesar's last night. The steak is undoubtedly good. But in my opinion, the prices are outrageous. I wanted steak & lobster but was invited out so could not possibly be so rude as to order it at a price tag of $63!! Plus the main dishes only come with a potato. Are we in Rome or Paris or New York? Sorry, this is Calgary people. Wake up."}
{"text":"It's very simple. When it comes to steak, that 10.5 ribeye was simply perfection.

Everyone else at the table was supremely satisfied with their beef. 

We had a superb waiter who took great care of us and provided for a very enjoyable evening.

I've traveled the world and love cooking steak. This place is in the top tier when it comes to steak."}
{"text":"Im back from Montreal, and LA, taking another break here in Calgary for a month or so.  I went to Caesar's last week with a bunch of friends! This restaurant was like a beautiful old fashioned place ( nothing negative to say about decor it was warm and beautiful) could have been a kick back to the 40's. It is  very very warm and kind of opulent. So much for the feeling or ambiance of the restaurant!! Four of us had steak. The menu is really all about steak with 2 offers of fish for main course. 3 of us enjoyed our steak. Really at par with any other resto, but - if you don't want a cool crowd...just a nice quiet dinner where one can actually hear the conversation.  One person ordered the steak with I believe Caesar's sauce which he found to be really horrible. Peppercorn sauce much better. I don't enjoy sauces so, I never have this problem!! :)  This is my review so I will take the liberty to say not enough interesting appetizers, nor where they great. Caesars salade lacking a nit of taste. Probably lack of garlic. The waiters look like they have been there a very long time. Their service was excellent. The barman doesn't really seem to know how to make drinks very well other than vodka cran, vodka soda, vodka martini.  Any new drink, was...just not on the mark.  If I am going to order a drink I really expect them to be delicious. They were not. One friend loves it there, so I will probably go back, I will give it a second try as I can't say anything truly bad, however truth be told I cannot rave about it. Steaks were excellent. Cooked to perfection.  The receptionist who took our coats was really really nice, cheerful and friendly. I would hire her if I needed someone to, well to do anything with the public!! She as the front person made it a nice first initial impression!!"}
{"text":"Terrible owners and treat their staff disgustingly!!! Yell at the lounge girls and say things like they dont have any brains. One of the managers (Jerry) got so drunk one night and threw a metal stapler at a waiters head and broke the huge glass mirror in the lounge. He did that while customers were in the lounge too. You should not go there and support Caesars, who overprice food and drinks just to rob their customers they care nothing about"}
{"text":"The waitstaff was very helpful and professional and the location was convenient to our downtown hotel. We were told this was one of the best steak houses in town. I sure hope it wasn't representative. While the food was OK, it certainly was not of the same quality as the steakhouses in Dallas. And for the price we paid, we had much higher expectations. Even the dessert left a lot to be desired. Can't say that I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here about 10 years ago and just found it on google.  It was truly awesome.  The food was great, but the service was just old-school sweet.

The waiter embodied great service: unassuming and attentive.  I like to focus on food and friends and this is what they do.

Glad to see it's still a great place"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best steakhouse I've ever frequented.  If you have never been, I highly recommend living on the edge and trying this place.  WOW is all I can say."}
{"text":"This place is still fantastic. 6 years since my
Last visit and just as amazing. Service is next level"}
{"text":"Loved the old school vibe this place gives off. Feels like I should be in the presence of Al Pacino or the cast of The Sopranos. Everyone working there was friendly and courteous. My steak was cooked perfectly to my liking and it was delish. No complaints whatsoever...and if you knew me...that says a lot. :)"}
{"text":"It was the Tuesday after crazy-Monday and I felt the need for some stress-eating. I couldn't decide between lobster and steak so I settled for Ceasars as they had a lunch dish with both items. The restaurant was almost empty when i got there and it was a little awkward being the only diner in the main dining area but I don't let little things like awkwardness come between me and good food. 

Started with French onion soup and fresh baked bread. The soup was aight, the bread was perfect.  As soon as I was done with my soup, the lobster and steak plate made it appearance and I did justice to the proteins. The stuffed baked potato was pleasant enough with the sour cream, bacon and chives topping.  The veggies on the plate looked fresh and tempting though I did not really touch them because vegetables are not a key component of the stressed-woman diet. :)

I enjoyed the decor details and service was impeccable. I can't say any of the food items blew my mind but this was still a more-than-pleasant-lunch experience"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible meal. The service was amazing, the steak was grilled to perfection, and the entire experience was worth every penny. We were visiting from Toronto and wanted a delicious steak meal, Caesar's did not disappoint. Not to mention, their drinks are INCREDIBLE ."}
{"text":"There is no denying it. Caesar's Steak House is the ultimate place to get steak in Calgary. 
The decor is modern, dark, and comfortable. The menu is pure steakhouse classic. They have multiple delicious Caesar's available for the connoisseur and some appetizers that have stood the test of time; including shrimp cocktail, escargot, and onion soup. The Caesar salad is delicious and you can order it to be made table side if two or more in your party are ordering it. You do have to ask though, as we ordered salad and it wasn't prepared table side like we thought it would be.
Delicious cheese and garlic bread is included and comes in a large basket which is difficult to ignore. 
The steaks are amazing. We had the 'front row' table - a great view of the steak being grilled on an open grill by Danny who has been with Caesar's for over 35 years. ...I think this may be a service record in Calgary. This guy knows how to cook a steak and mine was absolutely perfect so that when I heard the woman behind us complain her steak was underdone I felt sure that she had ordered the wrong way. And speaking of service, our server was top notch. He allowed us a decent amount of time in between drink refills and food courses and also recommended another wine when I was not enjoying our original choice.
If you have a special date or event this is the place to take your guest. It will truly be an evening well spent."}
{"text":"The coat check is nice as you come in.  However the experience kind of went down from there.  Went for new years Eve so our table was on the side of the entrance as a make shift table so people kept rubbing against us and bumping our chairs.  The drinks were extremely tiny,  even just a gingerale.  They charge you per non alcoholic drink too.  The cheese toast was pretty average, onion soup was too salty and looked like it was prepared from a can,  garden salad came from a bag and the dressing was over powering.  The lobster scampi was pretty amazing  though,  I highly recommend it.  The twice baked potato was good and the steak was average.  It was undercooked.  My husbands rib eye and my tenderloin were both supposed to be medium rare but came out very rare.  I wouldn't recommend going here.  There is better steak and seafood in this city for the same price. 
Also the service was terrible.  The waiter doesn't care about your night,  just reads off a script.  Doesn't ask you if you want another drink,  only came back once to refill our water and when we paid he didn't seem to like his 15 percent tip and didn't tell us to have a good night.  He just walked away from the table. I think 15 percent is good seeing how the service and good was below average."}
{"text":"Myself and my boyfriend went here for supper last night. I had the steak Neptune a he had a rack of lamb. They were both AMAZING!! Along with the great food our server Andrew T was absolutely fantastic! Thank you so much Andrew for the great experience at Caesar's restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"15 of us went here for dinner for my friend's bachelorette party.

As far as restaurants in this price range go, I'm not a huge fan of the ones with the old school vibe and decor and this restaurant definitely falls into that category.  I feel like its a place my parents or even grandparents would appreciate more than I do.

I ordered the Salmon Filet.  The Salmon seemed like it was a little bit overcooked, as it didn't flake right off as you'd expect for a $40 meal.  But, the vegetables were delectable.  A little sweet, but not too sweet.  I wish I had gone with the waiters recommendation of the stuffed potato because the rice was very, very bland, as if someone just tossed a little bit of butter in it, and maybe some salt and pepper.  I tried my friend's stuffed potato and it was extremely flavorful.  I also have to make note of the onion soup which came with a small circle of bread on top, which was perfect, not too soggy, not too tough, but absolutely delicious.

For a large group we were served pretty quickly, although the restaurant was maybe only a quarter full.

Perhaps if I ate beef I'd have a little bit better rating of this place, as they are a steakhouse.  It was a nice experience, but just a little too stuffy for my taste."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here for 20 years so I wasn't sure what to expect. Hubby took me for my birthday. As always Caesars doesn't disappoint. Love the updated decor. The service was exceptional. Our server went above and beyond making our dining experience memorable. The food was delicious. I had the steak Neptune medium rare. Steak was cooked perfectly and so were the prawns. Had the Caesar salad that our server made in front of us. Very garlicky   And to top off the night the cheesecake to go because we just couldn't fit another morsel of food in our mouths. Great ambiance. Yummy food. Highly recommend for a fine dining (kid free) experience"}
{"text":"We stopped here after a horrible experience at the sushi restaurant down the street - we wished we would have dined here! Melissa was AMAZING!!! She is passionate about her job and a delightful person. The gentleman behind the bar and hostess were also great. We could have stayed in there for hours ... we will be back to have dinner ... the escargot was just wonderful! No wonder this place has been so successful since the 70's! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner. The place still maintains its old look and feel, you get a great feeling just walking through the door. Great food and wine menu, and the food itself was fantastic. The steak was probably the best I've ever had! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews about Caesar's from friends & family, I was very excited to try the restaurant. However, I left with a feeling of severe mediocrity. While the service was great, the food was seriously lacking. In going to a restaurant with such a reputation, I was looking forward to a fantastic meal that would blow me away! This was not the case. Being Celiac made it even more challenging as I was not able to eat half my meal and the restaurant offered no substitutions or gluten free options. I had the 8.5 ribeye, with house salad, and twice stuffed baked potato. The salad was literally just a salad mix with oil and balsamic vinegar, which was lacklustre; I can make a better balsamic dressing at home. The twice baked potato was dry, and the steak was good, but I can cook one just as well or better at home. In my opinion, this was not worth the money and it's sad to say, but I've had a better meal at the Keg."}
{"text":"I've been to Caesar's a few times for lunch and have always enjoyed every meal!

My boyfriend and I decided to have our anniversary dinner at Caesar's (although both born and bred Calgarians, shockingly my boyfriend has never been here!)

After checking our coats, we were taken to our table and properly seated (how many places still pull your chair and drape napkins across your lap?) Once our drinks and food were ordered, we had a chance to take in the decor of the restaurant. For those who haven't been here - you're surrounded by dark burgundy leather chairs, pillars and  roman artwork. I read up on Caesar's and they've kept this place looking the same since they opened in the 1970's - and it looks classy!

The bread came out, covered in foil - but I soon realized it was to keep the huge heaping basket of delicious garlic and cheese bread warm (to quote my boyfriend - Is all this bread for us?! hahaha)

The French Onion soup here is TO DIE FOR! Broth is perfectly flavored and cheese baked on top seals in the aroma of this soup until you're ready to dig in. LOVE IT!

Our steaks were cooked perfectly and accompanied with a baked potato with all the fixings.

We managed to save some room for dessert and opted for the cheesecake and it was amazing - moist and not too heavy.

Will definitely be back again, always a good experience here :)"}
{"text":"Old school in every way from the decor to the waiters.  Inside it is dark and hasn't been updated since the early 80's. This is where the old boys go in Calgary for the fancy oil lunch. Get the onion soup, cheese bread and stuffed potato and of course the filet.  The waiters are uptight in that snooty butler kind of way but it's all good, go with it. I keep going back but I think the steak is overrated."}
{"text":"Hands down the best steak in the city.

Definitely don't pass up the cheese bread, it's amazing. My steak was done to perfection and the wine suggested complimented it perfectly. 

This place puts the Keg to shame."}
{"text":"Being a staple in downtown Calgary for many years you'd think they'd have things perfected by now. The parm toast however (a particular fav) is just not what it used to be. Service remains pretentious and one should truly be honoured to be served by one of their seasoned waiters. Probably the only place in town where you should consider yourself lucky to be served. The steak sandwich was fatty and the garlic toast it sat on was extremely dry and crusty. Leaving my steak fat and extra dry toast you would have thought i had not eaten by the amount of food left on my plate. Wishing i had brought a granola bar with me."}
{"text":"first walked in I was pointed to the dinning room I walked in dinning room was greeted by a waiter who stopped me from sitting asked if he could help me.. I asked for a table he said we are full (there was a ton of tables open) I was then told to go back to talk to the hostess where she told me to take a seat she needed to find a manager after about 15 min I was asked to sit in the lounge because of a dress code (I was wearing a hat). they couldn't have told me this when I first walked in?????. so sitting in lounge another 10min pass no one has helped me I had to shout with my hand up in the air to get attention of waitress this is absolutely wrong and complete disrespect if you ask me!!!!. walk in to a place to eat and takes 30min to be even greated with the respect to be asked what I wanted to drink. I WILL NOT COME TO THE WILLOW PARK LOCATION EVER AGAIN IF ANYONE WAS TO ASK ME HOW CREASERS IS I WILL LAUGH AND DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO DIRECT THEM ELSEWHERE!!!!. as I'm sitting here I watch the waitress in the lounge greet ppl within minutes and bring them drinks even faster!!!. 
after all this BS I ordered the most expensive thing on the menu the 12.5oz filet mignon with baked potato and cheese & garlic toast. my drink was never topped up always went 10+ min without a drink. 
in the end the double baked potatoes was amazing and so was the $45 steak.
OVER ALL I WISH THERE WAS A HALF STAR RATING!."}
{"text":"So, bar none, the best. But I'm bias, I'm older, and i think wiser,.
I have to confess, i have been coming here for 30 years, thru thick and thin. Good and bad.
For me, it is a place you can come to enjoy a great steak, salad, or just a nice glass of wine. Is it expensive, yes.
But take it for what it's worth, I've seen it busy and slow, i like slow. Service is excelent, in the lounge, servers can be prices in the dining room. But their expectations are, maybe, sometimes a little too high about their clients. But clients that's expect good service, without the \"pay attention to me\" attitude, will appreciate the professionalism. They just do their job.
It the lounge it's a much more relaxed attitude, great bartenders,  wonderfully servers and are very accommodating. 
Miss to togas though, kidding!
Okay now the food, excellent steaks, great appetizers, and cheese toast and garlic toast is, and always has been wonderful.
Call me old fashioned, but why change something that works, don't come everyday. But do come 3-4 times a year, or more if you can afford it. 

Thank your for staying the same, don't change, people should appreciate the finer things in life, at believe it or not, a very reasonable price, compared to the rest of their world, for quality like this."}
{"text":"This place has been moving from a 4 star to a 2 star at this point. The salads have gotten gross, and garlic bread is not as good as it once was. The only saving grace is the steak, which is well done. The service is terrible to say the least, and this place is slightly past its expiration date."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is formal, I actually changed after reading about the place and wore a proper pair of pants instead of jeans, upon arrival, I realized I was the only one not in jeans...  But the decor and service are very formal, even though I ordered the wine they let the man at the table taste it...
But I have to say, I felt like in a movie and the steak is really fabulous.. So well worth it for the food and dont over dress if you think you need to based on the website"}
{"text":"For our very first taste of what AAA grade Alberta beef was all about we scoured Yelp & Trip Advisor reviews for a good steak house. What made me pick this place over a dozen other highly rated restaurants was the tableside Ceasar salad on the menu.  That just upped the ante..it doubled our excitement & anticipation.  We were slightly skeptical about the place at first because it's tucked away at a corner of an unremarkable shopping center.  The exterior signage threw us off too because it looks just like the font used for Ceasar's Palace, the hotel chain.  Whatever doubts we had just disappeared the second we walked through the front door.  Service was excellent.  Especially considering my spouse & I had just come from a casino so we were dressed so casually compared to other patrons, but we weren't treated any differently.  Ryan was the Master craftsman that did a mean Ceasar salad, it was so good I had to give him a fist bump.   His sidekick, Andrew, entertained us with stories, including the history of the Ceasar salad & how it supposedly started in Tijuana, Mexico.  I'll let them tell you that story themselves because I gotta talk about the steak.  Alberta beef is very tender & has a very nice beefy flavor with lots of marbling.  My ribeye was a beautiful piece of meat cooked to perfection by a Grill Master enclosed in a glass booth.  The steak came with a twice-cooked baked potato which is essentially mashed potatoes scooped back into its own skin then baked until brown.  We had the cheesecake for dessert & it was a good way to end this wonderful meal.  What an enjoyable dining experience & definitely one of the highlights of our trip."}
{"text":"This place is very elegant and the food outstanding. It seems expensive but with each steak comes a cheese and garlic bread,onion soup, salad and a double baked potato by the time I got to steak I was full. Good value good service and quick and efficient."}
{"text":"We dropped in for lunch on a Friday in July, 2010, in order to have a steak because we know that when we want a good steak, we can't go wrong with Caesar's.  

I ordered the strip loin and my husband ordered the ribeye.  I don't know which was better because they both were so tender and flavorful.  Mine cost $27 but we were served a nice little bowl of clam chowder to start and the steaks were served with your choice of stuffed potato, baked potato, tomatoes and cukes, or rice, I believe.  I had the stuffed potato and it was really good and not too big.  

I really can't say enough good things about this restaurant.  Our server was right on the money and didn't keep coming to the table too often, which we really liked.  

Do try out Caesars.  The consensus around Calgary, for the most part, is that this is the place to go for a consistently delicious steak."}
{"text":"Excellent value and quality. With each entree, you get soup, salad, bread, and potato (or rice). The server was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, very attentive and friendly.
The food is good not great. Everything has a slightly sweet flavor.
My ribeye was perfectly cooked to medium-rare and the meat was tender as expected in a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the steak is fantastic.  Every time.

The problem is the 1970s attitude towards women.  I'll never have a business lunch or Dinner at Caesars again if there is a woman along.  The last time I did that they asked us to order for the women!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, amazing food. Our server Rudy was a gentleman the entire evening and the restaurant accommodated for our 2 Month old to join us and our guests from Japan. Very happy and will be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here after the numerous discussions with friends that had been here. I was expecting a run down interior with tears in the chair cushions and dusty old curtains, from what everyone made the 'old school' interior sound like. This wasn't the case at all. It was clean, well kept and they really pulled off their theme nicely. Yes it is old school but that's what they are going for and they did it well. 
Our server was great, very attentive but a little soft spoken to the point where we weren't quite sure what we had just agreed to because of his quiet tone. That was not going to take away from the experience whatsoever.
We ordered appetizers (scampi & escargot). Both were great and sticking with their theme, the escargot were served up old school style in the shell. We both got a kick out of that.
The soup and salad were pretty basic, tasty and thank goodness, not large. We had giant steaks coming and did not want to fill up on 'fillers'.
The steaks (ribeye & filet) arrived and were everything we hoped for. They were perfectly prepared, juicy and flavorful. I couldn't have been more impressed until we looked at the dessert menu that is. We always take a peak but were too full to have anything. That all changed when I seen the apple pie with RUM SAUCE. Only my favorite dessert of my childhood years. I had to have it and it was well worth the extreme fullness I had to deal with for thee rest of the night.  Overall an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Been going here for many years and its great.

This may sound weird, but one of the not to be missed dishes is the cheese bread appetizer.  Addictively good.  So simple,  So good.  Go to 
hell Mr. Atkins.

Steaks are what the place is about.  All cuts are excellent.  Just prime Alberta beef here.

Escargot is especially tasty.  Not too much garlic.

Wine list is sparse but diverse.  And good pricing too. Never disappointed.  Goes to show you do not need 300 wines on a list for to have a good experience."}
{"text":"The downtown Ceasar's is always a great place to wine & dine.  Excellent menu, wine list and service.  Cool becoming-kitschy interior.  Best part is if you sit next to the indoor grill.  Video below shows it in action!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot, and I try to find really nice restaurants to eat dinner at.  Last time I was in Calgary I found some real winners, but had regretted not making it to Caesar's.  This visit my hotel was close, and I was excited to see what all the hype was about.  I consider myself a connoisseur of fine steak, and took up a quest a few years back to learn how to prepare a steak like the ones you get at very fine restaurants that you bite into and just melt into a heavenly place.  Growing up when my mom made steak, it was always over-cooked, and a less than appealing experience.  The first time I had a real prime steak was at Ruth's Chris in Houston, and after that I was hooked.  I've been back to that eatery a time or two, and frequented Truluck's, Churrascos, America's, Fogo de Chao, Texas de Brazil, and other fine steak houses in Houston, Denver, and other cities.  I can now make a MEAN prime steak myself as well that rivals the big steakhouses.  I'm just telling you this to preface my review so you know I'm not just pulling this out of the air.
     I wasn't really dissuaded by the decor as most people who have left reviews, although I was left wondering why they joined the faux marble pillars with brown rather than ivory caulk.  I was told by a previous occupant of Calgary that he had been denied entry due to his attire, so I dressed up, only to show up and walk in behind people in plain street clothes, and what looked like slippers.  If you're not wearing a tank top and cutoffs they'll seat you.  The staff  was nice, and quite attentive.  The presentation was pretty good.  I was not displeased.
     The soup is a bit salty as mentioned in other reviews, but I didn't mind it.  I thought overall it was pretty good.  I was a little turned off by what looked like Kraft Parmesan that they shoveled into it.  I'm sorry, but at a classy restaurant, you should grate the cheese onto the soup fresh.
     They must be reading these reviews, because they switched out the iceberg lettuce for a little more leafy salad with a lot of different things in it, but it was still bland, and unimpressive.  I'm not a big salad person anyway, so I was willing to excuse that.
     When my 12.5 oz fillet came out, it was perfectly cooked medium rare as I had requested.  It was huge, and must have weighed all of the 12.5 oz that they were claiming.  The stuffed potato looked great, and they came up and put sour cream, chives, and something that could barely be passed as bacon on it.  Again, if it comes with a $56 steak, you can put REAL bacon on it, not that gross imitation crunchy McDonalds facon bits.  Come on now, this is a fancy restaurant.
     Ok, we're coming up on why I gave it 1 star instead of 5 stars.  I'm getting there.  I cut into the steak, which looked great, it seemed to offer more resistance to the knife than I would have expected for a silver star AAA piece of meat that should have been REALLY marbled to be in the 56$ category, but boy was it ever just cooked perfect.  It is always a problem that they don't cook the steak right, and this one was perfect.  I put my fork into the piece I had removed, and as is my custom, I closed my eyes when I put that first bite into my mouth so I could focus on the heavenly yumminess of fresh cooked medium rare prime fillet.  The steak hit my tongue, and...  nothing... I bit into it, and chewed on it a little... No awe striking flavor or yumminess.  Just meat.  Not particularly tender, not really juicy in a good sense despite there being blood.  It was just like a real big tough hunk of choice grade rump roast.  I only ate half of it, and left the rest on the plate.  I could have brought it home for a dog, and I wouldn't have felt wasteful giving it to an animal.  In my mind it was an $8 hunk of meat.
     The waiter came up and asked me how it was, and I couldn't even offer the usual nicety of just saying good, which I in just about every circumstance do.  I told him it was \"so-so\" and I was pretty disappointed.  He asked me if I wanted another one, and I explained that I didn't think it would really make a difference, as I felt it had to do with the preparation as well as the meat.  I filled up on the stuffed potato, because in all honesty it was much more tasty than the unseasoned rump roast they tried to pass off as a 56$ steak.  Just for the record, I have no problem paying that much for a steak, but I want it to be an experience, and I don't want to feel like leaving most of the steak on the plate.  I want to eat the last bite and wish I weren't too full to order another.  That was a shameful steak.  Don't waste your money.  even if the meat had been good the prep was bad.  I don't care what the other reviews say, the prep is nothing to be excited about.  I can whip up a steak at home that would knock the socks off of this place.
     On two occasions I had excellent steaks at Vintage Chop House down the street. Go there instead, it's not disappointing."}
{"text":"First, let me say I was taking my good friend out for his birthday and this was his choice. It was a Monday (not that should make any difference but factual freaks always get upset if you do not say when you were there if you do not post the review the same day).

That being said, I found the menu overly expensive except the desserts were reasonably priced and based on the table across the way, looked very tasty.

There were only 5 other tables with patrons but the general dress code appeared to be dressy. The place is dimly lit so provides a rather quiet, cozy, and intimate ambiance.

While the server retrieved our drinks (water for me and my friend got some kind of Caesar that was different the original recipe since the spice was removed from it), I was free to check other food options from the other patrons to get an idea about portion size and appearance. I could also sense if the food was good or not. You can view the menu from the Menu tab on their website at http://www.caesarssteakhouse.com/home.htm

My friend had the 10.5 oz ribeye (so tender and tasty) and I had the grilled wild sockeye salmon (so good grilled) with baked potato (warm and fresh) and vegetables (the carrots were perfectly cooked).

Too bad, after the complimentary cheese and garlic bread, and the main courses, I was too stuffed to try the dessert (my next trip will be dessert and a drink).

As I stated previously, this place is rather expensive but by no means the most expensive in Calgary but it is a nice place to have a celebratory dinner and highly likely not to have someone with a bunch of kids running around unattended (due to the higher price). It is worth it to dine here due to the excellent food and service.

Not knowing Julius Caesar personally, he might be a vegetarian and not a meat eater!"}
{"text":"I will start with positives:
You will be stuffed 
Fillet steak was cooked to perfection
Professional service 
Good atmosphere

Negatives:
Too much food
No need for average salad and toast
Expensive (2 steaks no starters +1 bottle of wine $215 without tip) for that price I would expect an exquisite salad not precut bag of greens you can get at Safeway. 

Will I be back? Perhaps"}
{"text":"FINALLY detoured the Keg, grabbed a few friends and made it out to Caesar's!
Free valet was a wonderful option that the restaurant provides and we took it. The valet guy was great, prompt and honest as my husband left his brand new cell phone in plain view in the console and it was not touched.
Walked inside and WOW, the place is much larger than it looks from the outside, cavernous almost!
We were seated way at the back at 530pm (with resos) in a cave-like area as the ceilings were lower in that spot. I liked it, and I liked that at first we were the only diners in at that point. It did fill up by 8pm or so, good crowd.
I personally loved the red, old school, gangster feel to the place. I had it all built up in my head from what I had read from on-line reviews and it did not disappoint.
Our server was older, reserved, polite but in all honesty, I felt like he would have rather been doing cartwheels on the moon than serve tables this evening.
Our friends had been before and pointed out to us the menu area of Emperor's Feast where you get a steak/entree, bread to start along with a garden salad, your choice of dressing) and a little French Onion soup. For me, it was a lot of food and I brought home half my entree but I chose the wrong cut of steak for this restaurant. I was so looking forward to being able to \"cut the meat with my butter knife\" but on the NY Strip, this did not happen and my friend beside me also was disappointed in how tough hers was. She said it could have been an off day or bad meat selection as she has had the strip before here and said it was terrific. The men at the table scored with their steaks, those being a rib eye and the 10oz Filet. Both sumptuous, I got to try both and nothing needed additional seasoning. The server seemed to understand the trouble with the strips and his manager was nice enough to take $15 off each steak without us even asking for compensation of any kind. Classy. This review would have garnered a 4 or 4.5 if the meat had been a nicer cut, but the cookery itself was spot on. I loved how I could see the steak grilling from our table, outside the kitchen.
I loved the little details of this place - like how the salad plates were stone cold as they should be and the dinner plates were hot. The soup was OK, salad great and the bread was fantastic. My friend beside me went into orbit over their parm cheesy bread, a nice twist on fresh Texas Toast. I preferred the garlic toast included in the basket but both rated as excellent. Refills of the bread were no problem.
The table did not love how the skinny glasses of pop at almost $4 each did not include refills. But, the meals were a great value starting at $38 for the rib eye.
We would absolutely go back just for the originality of the place but I am sure there are other steakhouses in Calgary to try first.
3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Food - Great as usual.  These guys KNOW their steaks, how to age, how to season and how to cook it to request.
Service - Disappointed this time.  I think we got one of the original waiters that has been around since it opened.  He tried, so I give him credit, but man, he was slow.  I watched all the other waiters almost running back and forth to the kitchen and got a case of waiter-envy.  We arrived at 11:45, didn't get our food until 12:45 because our waiter meandered through serving his tables.  Oh well, not much you can do about that I guess.
Decor - Outdated and dark.  Tourists and old businessmen probably love it.
Overall - I will return, the steaks and onion consomme are enough to have me return, but I hope this time we get a waiter with a little more pep."}
{"text":"Very old school, think 50s or 60s. Reminds me of Tom Jones in DT Toronto. Male waiters that have been at the job for a long while. Big change from the recent trend of putting hot young ladies in low cut outfits out there to take the food orders. 
They definitely know how to cook at steak at Caesar's. Don't stray from the steak list and you will be fine. A bit pricey but hey as long as it's on an expense account..."}
{"text":"Great steaks.  I mean, really great steaks.  

The place is a bit formal and the service polite but a tad stuffy.  

I had an OK salad and a good baked potato with my steak.  

The only downside is that the wine list absolutely sucks.  This might be due to a local disinterest in wine, I dont know.  But in my book, there is nothing that goes better with grilled red meat than a good Bordeaux or Cotes du Rhone.  I had to settle for a mass produced beer."}
{"text":"We needed a place to go for my cousins 25th birthday. 25th birthdays are always a big deal. 

We were able to get a reservation for a group of about 20 for a Thursday night easily. 

To begin, there's valet service on the weekends and evenings I believe. A nice little coat check, and then the interior is all swank. Rich red & golds. Love it.. I read in a previous review describing it as \"old Las Vegas\" -- that describes it perfectly!

The service here is unreal! Absolutely amazing! They are so attentive. People say this place is pricey -- but I don't think it's unreasonable or thaaat expensive at all! The food is amazing! The entreas all include soup, salad, bread and then you MUST order the baked potato with your steak -- IT'S unbelievably good. 

I ordered the ribeye (I prefer it over the sirloin).. figured if this place is as good as it's made out to be then I'll come back to try the fillet mignon (now dying to find an excuse to go back and try it). 

The food is 5 stars, so is the service! I highly recommend visiting. 

the onlyyy thing i didn't like was that the bread was served in a foil basket.. that threw off the experience a little."}
{"text":"Yep they know how to cook a good steak. I wouldn't hurry to go back. Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Incredible food and really good service. They include homemade French onion soup, cheese and garlic bread, and salad with your meal. This downtown location are the only ones to do this though so if you want all of this included with your meal, be sure to go to the downtown location and not the willow park location.
The only downside about this are the pieces of the wine. Extremely over priced."}
{"text":"Classy place,  classy service,  classy steak.  Went there on our wedding anniversary and was very pleased with our choice. French onion soup,  bread and salad was a great start to what possibly was the best steak I've ever had. Food was filling and the price was decent.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place was interesting. The minute you walk in, you feel like you're in the most out dated restaurant ever... which you are! But i think it's done purposely like that. We were seated right beside this glass box where a chef would grill all their steaks.. It was good, it didn't get too hot or anything.

This place was definitely pricey... and for what you get, I don't think it's worth it. 

I ordered the Caesar's specialty NY strip sirloin. 

It started off with an onion soup with bread in it...When they asked if i would like cheese, i said yes and the waiter dumped a spoonful of Powdered Parmesan cheese.. a HUGE no no for french onion soup.. I tasted it and it was way too salty for my liking.

Next was a salad which was mainly ice berg lettuce and a bit of spring mix with balsamic vinegar... I hated this because i think ice berg lettuce is the cheapest and worst tasting type of lettuce you could use for a salad.

Finally, i get my steak and a twice baked potato. The potato was really good, topped with cajun spices, sour cream and onions. The steak was also really good and tender. since it was the casear's specialty, it had their special sauce all over the steak which was okay... just bbq sauce pretty much. The whole meal cost about $46 dollars and all that was good was the steak and potato. I'd much rather go back to Saltlik.

I think it was just the atmosphere that i wasn't a fan of and the appetizers really killed it for me... The place was also filled with who you can tell were Calgarian business men and was told that all locals come here."}
{"text":"It's a steakhouse, pure and simple. It's old school, but nothing to get nostalgic about. The food is solid, with nothing outstanding. The crowd is going to be geared towards the business suits on most nights. It's quality value, just not sure I'd be \"excited\" to visit again."}
{"text":"The classic that never gets old. I remember  coming  here as a child. It'd been  updated  and changed,  but it's still one of the finest  steaks in Calgary. 
The scampi starter was amazing,  coupled with the cheese and garlic toast .  
We ordered New Yorks and a filet. All perfectly seasoned and cooked as ordered. Simply  delicious. 
Best for a couple , but the kids kept calm and great times had by all."}
{"text":"Great place for a lunch.  Steak sandwich is a steal at $20.  Beef is tasty and well grilled. 

Onion soup is a good start to the meal, rich broth with good cheesy bits for that added salty kick. 

Decor is old but well kept, has rich colours and wall decorations.  The dim lighting also adds to the ambience.

4 stars because the service is not as good as expected.  Not rude per say, but indifferent to us."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times since the last review but I thought it was fitting that I reviewed again. 
My friend and I are both carnivores at heart and he had never been to Caesar's so we had an afternoon lunch in the lounge. 
I decided to try the Rib eye this time which is a cut I usually only eat at home off the BBQ. It's usually not cooked right for me in restaurants but at Caesar's they know beef. The steak was terrific, the side cucumbers and tomatoes are a must here and if they put enough of the vinegar based dressing they can't be beat. With a delicious side caesar salad to start and the complimentary onion soup I don't think you can have a better lunch. 
We watched football on the TV in the lounge and the service was very friendly and prompt. She even laughed at all my buddies corny jokes which lead to him wanting to buy so he could tip. This was a win-win day for me."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends from Europe, looking to try something different steak wise, we all
Really enjoyed our dinners, the sides, and the service. Was defiantly a unique experience for Europeans !"}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Spent a romantic dinner for two celebrating our anniversary. Our waiter was very friendly and curious. Must have the classic Cesar it was amazing perfect amount of spice. 

I ordered the steak Diane cooked right at our table so tender and juice. Just perfect. My lovely had the rib eye steak and lobster tail. Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a special night out."}
{"text":"The SE location has better service, food and spicy Caesar. The food was good but our waiter wasn't the friendliest. The spicy Caesar was good but not my favourite. Would come again but to the other location."}
{"text":"When I want a good steak, Caesars is definitly the place to go. Professional and Friendly waiters. I noticed all of the waiters are men, you don't see half dressed ladies walking around trying to be servers without knowing what they are doing. You are getting professional service. I had the 3 course which came with a Salad, Soup and T-Bone steak. Wow you are really getting your moneys worth! better then the KEG. Without a doubt it is definitely one of my favourite restaurants in Calgary. The place has got an old school vibe. I guess old is gold!"}
{"text":"Best steak in Calgary by far.  Downtown location is my favorite, although the south location just went thru a big reno that I have not seen yet.  Love the breaded Scampi starter.  Filet is my cut of beef, and is always cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Having been in Calgary since the 1980s, this recent visit to Caesar's was admittedly my very first visit to the steak house.  As others have said the decor is a blast from the past...  It was actually too dark for my taste but I guess that's the type of decor in style back in the 1970s.  

Let's start with the not so great... the blue cheese salad which was drenched in dressing, while the onion soup which was way too salty.    

The two things that made a good impression were the cheese bread and the rib eye steak.  The bread was the best I've had in a long while.  The rib eye was tender and cooked to perfection... which I guess almost made up for the salty soup."}
{"text":"My husband and I were seated in the small room with other tables that had 4-10  people at each table.  With a few drinks into everyone the people started talking   louder and louder we could not even hear each other talked unless you could talk very loud over everyone else yelling.  You are packed into this restaurant and all the tables are so close together that you can hear each others conversation or small kids fussing and crying to us it seemed more like a family style atmosphere and not like a couples night out that we were hoping for.  I ordered scampi and it was way to salty our waiter didn't come back to check on us  so I couldn't inform him of the matter. Our steaks were very good but have been to other fine dinning restaurants that are way better will not ever be going back to this one"}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner because of couple of nice reviews and as suggested by some local as well. I don't know exactly how good is good or nice is nice with them but It took us almost 20 minutes to wait for someone to take our order. An old male server that was attending us was unprofessional. I'm not saying because he's old, I'm saying because of how we get treated.  Probably cause we're asian and that he didnt give that quiet of attention . Water spills on our table, the plate looks rusty I don't know if that's the concept of the restaurant. Regardless of the utensils what I always made to review is how I get treated. When we asked our bill and gave him 60percent of the tip there he showed us a little concern. My companion that night was the ambassador for exceptional service from the states, serving 12 years in cruises and 10 years in luxury collection hotel. I really felt bad."}
{"text":"Caesar's is without question, one of my favorite restaurants in Calgary.  I go a minimum twice a year - my birthday and my husband's birthday.  It has been our little tradition with Caesars since the day we met.

I have lived in Calgary for over 20 years and I have been going to Caesars since the beginning.  Never have I walked in there and noticed any change in decor.  It is not run down at all, but it is classic and never-changing in its decor and ambiance.

It has a \"boys club\" feel, in the sense that if I scan the room, I am usually one of few females in there.  It feels as though many business deals have been made in there over a steak lunch or dinner.

I have been in Caesars for lunches when staff members have had milestones (retirement, departures) and also for countless dinners with friends.

If I could describe Caesars in a few words it would be consistently delicious.  The food doesn't have a gourmet twist on it - they focus on what they do best which is out-of-this-world steak.  

Their onion soup, salads, potatoes and veggies are all extremely good as well.  Again, no gourmet twist but better-than-basic, yumminess.

You haven't really been to Calgary or had Alberta Beef without a trip to Caesars."}
{"text":"A classic, old boys club steakhouse.  This place is an institution in downtown Calgary and I hope they never update the 1950s interior.  Have the Caesar's Special - a New York Strip grilled to perfection and basted in Caesar's special BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Awful awful service. My reviews are always fair, but I want to just emphasize what happened to me and my girlfriend here on Valentine's: The server literally asked us if we could afford this restaurant (We are 20), and then he told us we should learn a thing or two about \"legitimate and adult\" restaurants when we said we do not fancy wine. With that being said, I used to be a cook so I did tip because I enjoyed the food and I knew the cooks get a percentage: he then asked me if I ordered too much and couldn't afford to tip higher (I tipped 15% because of his awful service). I was baffled as any of you would be."}
{"text":"Of three steaks one was sent back but all three should have been. Too bad they were over cooked.  In my opinion they not only ruined the steaks but ruined our evening.  Usually the food is very good but somebody really dropped the ball.  I expect more when we go here."}
{"text":"Go to the keg or Ruth's Chris or a diner if you want edible food.  just awful!


Worst food I have ever had. Service was awful. The scampi was overdone and far too much lemon. The salad smelled like it came out of a bag from the supermarket with kraft dressing. The onion soup was bland and the steak Diane that was supposed to be prepared table side was prepared 2 tables away. It too was bland and served with a few thinly sliced mushrooms and carrot sticks. The twice baked potato which is pretty hard to ruin was overcooked. I seriously wish there was something good I could say about our experience there, but there is nothing. The waiter came to the table with pos in hand wanting us to pay immediately and when we asked for some time to finish our wine he walked away in a huff. We talked to the manager and he didn't care to hear our concerns. He didn't come to the table to try to rectify things, rather he sent a waiter over who asked us 3times if we wanted a drink on the house. Three times we said no, that was irritating as well.  All we got for our trouble was the first round of drinks and dessert comped. None of us will ever go back there again, after paying close to 300 dollars for the meal, the michaelinas I had when I got home tasted far better than anything we had at Caesars.. Awful service, awful food."}
{"text":"A decent steak for lunch, but to be honest I expected more.

When I dine is such a fancy establishment I expect the food to be at the same calibre as the restaurant's perceived intricacy. My steak was cooked as I ordered it and quite good but definitely not worth some $30 when paired with the sub-par fries I received. It was very interesting to watch them cook it on the indoor grill, but I could watch myself grill for a steak just as good and about a third of the price.

Great looking restaurant with some mediocre food."}
{"text":"Caesar's has a reputation for it's steak, however, vegetarian friends can also get the best of both worlds. The best part of Caesar's in my opinion is their cheese bread. I cannot begin to explain how good the cheesebread is. It's like from another planet. Somewhere where food is amazingly good.

I have a lot of meat eater friends and they love a good steak. They make a wonderful alternative for vegetarians which includes roasted potatoes, tomatoes, and other greens. It's really delicious, well cooked, and all-around good. So, don't shy away from Caesar's dear Veggie friends! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best steak in Calgary, maybe the best steak everywhere.  My wife and I are regulars at Caesar's and tonight I might of had the best steak ever.  Hats off to George, George and Jerry, keep up the good work.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"\"Good beef and good service\" pretty much summarizes this place for me. 

It looks like something from the 70s. It's a little dark and gloomy for my taste.  

The soup was awful, the salad was pre-packed, and the bread was so ugly looking we didn't even touch it. The \"filet mignon\" was so tender and juicy and it was just incredible. The service was outstanding as well. Needless to say that this place is quite expensive!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money - go elsewhere. 

Went out to celebrate some family visiting Calgary for the first time and chose Caesar's based on the rave reviews. Unfortunately I have never had such an awful meal, especially at the prices they charge here. I eat a variety of different places, both high and low end and have enjoyed myself in all of them, this is the first time that I have actively wanted to walk out of restaurant.

I've outlined the pros and cons below in order to keep this review relatively short. 

Pros:
Steak was okay. Not the best I've ever had but still pretty tasty
Managed to get a table at the last minute on a Saturday night
Valet parking is always a good thing

Cons:
The appetizers that come with the meals are underwhelming. Soup from a can, salad from a bag and the garlic bread was clearly pre-made and frozen along with being SUPER greasy.
The garlic bread came wrapped in TIN FOIL. At an upscale restaurant!!
My steak came with a Bearnaise sauce that tasted like a fried egg
Was NOT a good cut of steak, though the cooking and flavour were okay.
Our waiter was quite old and had a really hard time hearing or understanding us. I tried to be understanding but the tables around us were commenting as well. 
We also had a really long wait between ordering drinks, then apps then our mains.

Oh, and it is not dressy at all. Most people were in jeans and I saw one couple in sweatsuits."}
{"text":"Me and my 6 yr old son and my best friend went here tonight and we had the best service and the food was amazing we ordered steak lobster and appys all came out at the rite time.what made this place amazing that the manger came to out table and offer my little guy some plastic cocktail Sword to play with .The manger really payed attention to our table ,with the manger just doing these  little thing to keep my son busy was really nice.every waiter,no matter who you asked or something ,would bring it out to you rite away.Im so impressed with the service and food.I will be going back.
Thanks to you all!"}
{"text":"Yes, the throwback to the 70's decor is still in place at Caesar's. You have to love Caesar's as they are a true one of a kind. Sure, some peeps crank about the dark and dank interior and some of the ladies feel the place is too 'manly'. Come on, they know how to cook a steak and I have never received any 'tude from any of the servers .

Last week we attended the 4th Ave . location for a birthday dinner. The ribeye was cooked spot on. Others had the NY strip and an order of ribs. The ribs were the weakest part of the meal. The garlic and cheese toast is addictive and can lead to not having enough room to devour the 15 oz. ribeye (the BEST cut).

The cheque is not minimal $185 with tip for 4. Make sure you grab some of those white mints with the chewy center on the way out the door...."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience.  Caesar's has a sort of old-world charm only augmented by table-side Caesar salad, steak flambés, and its cozy, dimly lit quarters.  New age steakhouses are a dime a dozen, where Caesar's stands as a gem in downtown.  Kudos to Andrew, our server, for providing world-class service.  Great every time, all the time.

Come for the steak and cheese toast, stay for the ambiance."}
{"text":"My husband and his family have been going here for many years. I have now been to both locations and I think that this location on 4th is much nicer and more updated. The steaks at both locations are always incredibly tasty and cooked exactly to my specifications. The Caesar salad is also good. Overall though, besides the steaks being consistently good, this place has not much else to recommend it. The wine list is meh and overpriced and side dishes and cheese bread just aren't what they used to be. I did add a star though for both nice decor, cleanliness and good service."}
{"text":"A solid 4.5 stars. We came to Caesars for romantic dinner for two. The restaurant has an old school classic steakhouse charm. This place is classy, service is super attentive and friendly, food is tasty and they make a wonderfully cooked and flavoured ribeye. What can I say, the value is amazing. You can't get this quality of steak, with a side, a salad and a soup, all for $53.  If you love your steaks, this place is worth checking out."}
{"text":"My family enjoyed a wonderful dinner tonight. Our waitress was excellent. The ribeye and the T-bone were cooked to perfection. The cheesecake was delicious. The maitre d took great care of us."}
{"text":"I write this review with confidence after two poor experiences at Caesar's on 4th. Never before have I experienced such a thorough and poor restaurant experience at a location of any price point. I am appalled that I suffered through the experiences I did, especially at this \"premium\" spot. 

Caesar's definitely still caters the \"old boys club\" ambiance. Dimly lit even at lunch and completely windowless, the restaurant is one bad dream away from re-enacting Troy except without Brad Pitt. While it wasn't for me, I can't say that the novelty may fit some people's tastes so no major judgement there as far as theme restaurants go. 

While we were seated promptly and drink orders were taken, we then proceeded to wait 20 minutes to get our menus. No, not to order - to GET THE MENU. It was actually a different staff member that got these for us as our waiter was not only nowhere to be found (likely forgot about us, which is impressive considering we were a larger group of 6), but also impossible to flag down. 

Most of us at the table, including myself, opt for the steak sandwich, coming with a french onion soup that surprisingly was just as bad as the one I had the previous day in a small town in northern Alberta. The soup lacked body, had no cheese, a soggy piece of the same awful toast (that later the steak would be served on), and was horrendously over salted to boot. 

The garlic bread was dripping in grease, which can be redeemed if it is flavourful grease, but unfortunately no hints of garlic were to be found. Same story goes for the extremely salty cheese bread. 

Unfortunately for us, the misadventure continues as our main courses arrive. My rare steak arrives extremely medium. The unusual standard side of \"tomatoes and pickled cucumbers\" are revolting by any standard - the cucumbers were somehow more sour than any pickle I'd ever had with no other flavor to it whatsoever. This is one quirky side I'd avoid like the plague. Interestingly there were ZERO other vegetable side options coming with the steak (while mushrooms, broccolini, etc were available to purchase as additional shareable sides for ~$9). The steak was served on a really awful cheap piece of toast. 

Then comes the lowlight of the day - whilst refilling water, the waiter spills a glug of water from the jug directly onto the steak sandwich, and then saunters off without seeing the looks of shock on my (and my colleague's) face. Are you kidding? 

What a terrible, awful, no good experience at Caesar's. If this had only happened once I would consider chalking it up to an off day, but this is the second time I've come for lunch and had a poor experience. 

I hate being that guy sending things back at a restaurant, and unfortunately the social context of this business lunch had me mum on the matter, but there is not a single thing I would be willing to pay for had I been alone. I will be sure that Caesar's management will hear of this experience as well. It is absolutely shocking to me that people rate this restaurant so highly given my consistently poor experiences here. If you're going to get spendy on food, do so elsewhere. AVOID."}
{"text":"A friend wanted to do a last minute business lunch downtown and we were able to get a reservation about one hour before noon.  We both ordered the rib eye with a stuffed potato and my friend had the cucumber and tomato salad. We both ordered our steaks medium rare.  The steak comes with a soup and I had the french onion while my friend had the cream of celery.  The soups were alright. The steak was cooked perfectly today. We both really enjoyed the steak; it was juicy, perfectly marbled and incredibly flavourful.  Our server was very friendly.  Overall, it was a great lunch dining experience."}
{"text":"Just had a great dinner celebrating my parents 50th wedding anniversary at the Willow Park location. The food, service, everything was great. Its been a long time since I had a steak that good in a restaurant. Was last here about 15yrs ago....will not take that long for the next time."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, Caesar's is such a Calgary classic, you cant help but love it. From the old-school decor to the cooking stations and the service, it's always a delight to dine here.

We were a group of 8 celebrating a birthday, and were seated at a great table right in front of the cooking station. I was surprised the waiter didnt drape our napkins - not a big deal, I just would have expected that small touch from a restaurant of this caliber. Of course we had to start with the garlic cheese bread - my absolute favourite. We joked that we would be happy to eat that all night and forget about the rest. Fortunately though, we all ordered delicious meals and were very happy we did. A bunch of us went with the \"Emperors Feast\", which includes soup, salad, and your entree. The starters are basic, keeping it extremely simple with dressings, etc - but it was a nice filler before your meal. The rest of the group had the fish as well as the the Chateaubriand for two. I went with the filet mignon with a lobster tail on the side, and I literally devoured every bite. The steak was melt in your mouth delicious, and the lobster was cooked to perfection. I absolutely LOVE the stuffed baked potatoes, and they are generous with the toppings which was a huge plus for me. 

As always, our service was impeccable. The only thing I didn't like was how far they placed the wine bucket from the two people who ordered it. We kept having to get the others at that end of the table to pass us the bottle when we wanted more, as the waiter was not observant to our empty glasses. The birthday girl got a complementary dessert, and they conveniently split the bill for all of us. Yes, it is pricey, but we knew that going in and the large portions made it money well spent.

It was a great experience and I'll definitely return for a special occasion in the future."}
{"text":"What fun!  I am a fan of old, set in time places- and this one qualifies!

Set in 1979, this vinyl-clad red-booth and white-table-cloth steakhouse pays homage to ROME and Julius Caesar, with white roman columns throughout, photos and art of Roman antiquities, and of course the Roman BBQ pit, aflame in the middle of the dining room, attended by chefs cooking up some damn good meat.

Started with a Ceasar, reminiscent of a Bloody Mary but with Clamato and celery salt, a Canadian favorite that supposedly started right here. Moved on to the Langostino Scampi starter in Garlic and butter- can't go wrong with that!  The salad was a bit heavy, the soup a bit salty, and the baked potato a little fake cheesy. The small filet, cooked medium rare and served on a hot plate was an example of steak perfection!  Delicious and cooked perfectly- flavorful and moist. All this with a good Argentinian Malbec to wash it down.

We were too stuffed for desert.  What a great evening!"}
{"text":"Caesar's may be some 30 odd years old. It may also not have changed in those 30 years since it's been open. But if there's anything in Calgary you must experience at least once, it's a visit to Caesar's. That is, unless you're a vegetarian. Caesar's is meat, meat and more meat.

Walk in from the street and you're greeted with a pair of big wooden doors. Don't worry, they're not heavy. Straight ahead of you is the lounge, and to the left, the dining room. The whole place is oozing in old-school atmosphere. It reminds me a bit of the calibre of people and service at the Petroleum Club.

I couldn't stop looking around the dining room at the decor. Wood panelling covering all walls, red leather (or was it vinyl? Not sure. It's bright at any rate!) covering the seats, huge archways in the middle of the room, a torch at one end that doubles as the grill. If Caesar's opened today, I doubt it would fly. But this, well, it's running on tradition. Our server, an older gentleman, I swear he's been there from the very beginning. Friendly, yet proper, he was attentive to our table with a detail and class you just don't see anymore. He wouldn't even reach across the table to fill the water glass one of my dinner mates offered up. Instead, he walked around to the other side of the table, where said dinner mate sat, and filled the glass from there, like I'm sure he's done hundreds of times before. You won't take this gent off his training.

Food-wise, we shared a couple of appys, the escargot and the Scampi while sipping Caesars (yes, Caesars at Caesar's). I also nibbled a bit on dinner mate's steak and stuffed potato. His starter salad wasn't anything to write home about. A few greens with some dressing. But the rest? Delicious! Especially that stuffed baked potato. Yummmmm-y!"}
{"text":"The cheesy garlicy bread is frickin' unreal.  Had the NY Strip and it was quite tasty...not the best steakhouse but not too shabby for Canadia.  Wine list is lame but did have a few nice selections.  They need about 100 more reds to match their prices."}
{"text":"Great steaks. A little upscale but very reasonable. Noticed many business men and women eating and meeting."}
{"text":"Lucky me to get treated to another fine business dinner! Ours sales exec took us and another project team out to Caesar's for some good, ol' Alberta beef.  The decor reminded me of an old-time Las Vegas lounge where you might expect to see the Rat Pack hanging out.  The service was very attentive to our larger group.  The food was very good.  We had an assortment of sides with our steaks as well as a couple of delicious lobster tails.  I had the rib-eye and it was perfectly prepared.  Great meal and service!"}
{"text":"Hail Caesar! Unless he is about to go down for the count...then hitch your cart to Brutus' train.

Caesar's has always been the best steak house in Calgary, and can go head to head with the world. I have been eating there for years and, as the waiters say, \"nothing changes except the prices.\" 

Oh, and based on this recent visit, maybe the quality. This was my most disappointing visit. The salad was a mish mash of veggies who had never heard the word \"presentation\" with a dollop of dressing that looked like a horse turd. The soup was uninspired. The steak still delivered the goods...but it wasn't the euphoria-enducing meal of years ago. 

Is Caesar's empire fading? Check back to find out."}
{"text":"In a city like Calgary, which does not respect its traditions and heritage (unless those traditions involve wearing a cowboy hat), there are not many institutions, culinary or otherwise.  That makes Caesar's stand alone, as it is truly such a thing, a Calgary institution.  With its Greco-Roman imagery (together in one place, really), wood-paneled walls, and bright red carpet, it is a sight to behold.

First things first, the steak is excellent.  It is consistently and reliably the best steak you can have in downtown Calgary.  They cook it exactly as you want it, and the spicing, marbling, and finish are perfect.  Kudos as well for the perfect pairing that their \"old school\" baked potato or salty french fries provide.  It is amazing \"guy food\" - I can't even think of the last time I saw a woman in there, and you would never see two women dining together without a man with them.  Anyway, I digress.  

I don't know how many times I have had the \"steak sandwich\", but it is amazing.  A nice 10 oz sirloin steak, nicely spiced, placed atop a spongy piece of thick white bread.  Their \"cheese bread\" is also amazing, as is their French onion soup.  These three items are so good that the rest of the menu is quite simply unnecessary.

There is nothing current, mod, or trendy about Caesar's, but that is why I love it.  It is a glimpse into a world that no longer exists, when men had \"liquid lunches\" and did not know what cholesterol was. And thank goodness for that - I hope it never changes, and that Caesar's never closes."}
{"text":"Went there for supper this evening. A few things: The waiter was lacking in social skills and he seemed unhappy in his job, the service was just okay, the onion soup was tasty (it arrived in something smaller than a teacup but whatever), the salad was underwhelming, and the meat was super fatty. What makes me sad is that I have heard this place is amazing. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Our first time at Caesars Willowpark and was amazing. Got an ok table, requested something more romantic, we got it. We ordered escargot, shared a Caesar salad, rib eye steak, cappuccino, apple pie with ice cream. Everything was awesome.  The ambiance, the food, our server and the decor. The best dinner I've had all year :)) 

xxS"}
{"text":"Not bad, the steak was cooked to perfection! It was pretty good.   Very $$$$, we are in Alberta where beef comes from?? The Caesar salad was just ok and the cheese bread was very very dry, try the cheese bread at hys, that's what cheese bread should taste like.  The Caesar drink was very yummy.  4 of us to eat steak was $390.00.  1 bottle of wine at $67 so it's an expensive  night if you are up for the spend! It's Calgary thou and food  is $$$$$"}
{"text":"Great beef!!... The ambience is a little old style for my taste, but is still nice... There is always a lot of people, but the service is not bad... I would go back there for good beef!!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing night with my partner here at Caesar's Steak House in WillowPark. Our waiter kindly explained the different types of steak - we ended up choosing the Filet Mignon, medium rare. It was delicious, tender, and juicy. The atmosphere at the restaurant is also great for a romantic evening date night. Our waiter provided exceptional professional service. We would definitely consider coming back to dine again. :)"}
{"text":"This is THE place to go in Calgary for a steak.  Forget about the keg, smugglers (though Smugglers has the best prime rib), Hy's, or any other place.  

You're going to spend $30-$40 for a steak but you'll get the service to match that price.  They check your coat at the door, pull the table out for you to sit, and wait on you like you're a king.

The service mau be a little over the top, but once you have that beautiful piece of steak between your molars you'll forget about everything else around you.  The steaks are perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth.  The cheese bread is like crack-cocaine and their home made creamy garlic salad dressing is just the icing on the cake.

Just make sure you leave room for the liquore sundae for dessert."}
{"text":"This place is a classic in a city where alot changes. The steaks are the best in the city and the service is very professional.  Do yourself the favor and try a Caesar salad, cheese toast and the new York steak with their signature sauce. The scampi and salmon are good. If you come here often the waiters even remember your favourite table and call you by name. The recent renovation is worth seeing."}
{"text":"Swanky old school red carpet steakhouse. Excellent waitstaff; good cheese bread, excellent wines. I had the prime rib, and it was very delicious. The grade ratings were different from the states, our meat was 10% of the best. Very enjoyable. If I smoked, I felt like I could use a nice cigar after the meal."}
{"text":"My boss took me out to a special lunch @ Caesar's Steak House.  We ordered almost right away as we were hungry.  My boss ordered the French Onion Soup and the Steak Sandwich, medium rare.  I had the French Onion Soup and the Rib Eye Steak, rare with a side of vegetables.  We really enjoyed our food.  I love my steak!  I have to come back here.  It is really a fantastic steak house!  

Service was really good.  The restaurant was bustling during the lunch hour.  

Thanks, boss, for taking me here!!  :o)"}
{"text":"I will give Caesars this, they know how to grill a steak. Period.  This is their thing and the chicken, salmon and whatever other distractions they have on the menu are almost pointless to have on there if you ask me.  It's kinda like going to a Japanese sushi joint and asking for a burger, just doesn't work.

The decor is old school, like a scene out of Casino. Seriously.  I was expecting Joe Pesci to smash out of a back room and blow everyones head off!!! It is not awful, there is a lot to look at but the cherry red \"leather\" seats and faux marble pillars everywhere really should be toned down or out...everything else is what you would expect a steak house to be.

I like that the wait staff are more, ahem- mature but I found the waiter serving us was indeed indifferent and seemed like he would rather be somewhere else.  He made a stink about us and the other group of people we were with switching seats, clearly indicating that if we move we have to stay where we are...ok whatever, there were only 6 of us and we all pretty much ordered the same thing.

I too agree with the less than stellar onion soup and salad to start, they were simply cheap fillers if you ask me.  The starter bread with parm was divine though!  I could have eaten the entire basket!  But the main, good god, that steak was quite possibly the best I have had in Calgary and I don't know why I have not come here sooner.  Rib-eye, ya ya so bloody good.  I was not a fan of the potato it came with and didn't like that you don't get a basic veg with your meal, I ordered ala carte and got some carrots which were nice.

The apple pie ala mode was quite generous and my hubby loved it, I had the cheesecake but it was just ok, tasted like the unbaked jello type but hit the spot for a sweet finish.  For drinks we had believe it or not, Caesars but they were terrible, for a place called Caesars, you would think that they could get this simple drink right.  I hated having to sauce up my own drink. The thought of 75 other people man-handling that bottle of tabasco and Lea and Perrins totally turned me off.  Oh and they rimmed the glass with regular table salt, not celery salt so you can imagine how salt-licious it was...bleah! PASS!

Price was alright, about $50 a head not including booze...all in all I would definitely be back, this is one place that makes the steak right.  Also, they have valet parking which I didn't know about till after we found street parking. 

SKIP the Caesars cocktail. Go for the steak."}
{"text":"Yea, Yea - I know.. this place is literally older than me and I only JUST NOW MADE AN APPEARANCE!

Thanks to a work expense account I was booked in for a Holiday lunch at the famous Caesars with a client. This was exciting as I have never been and heard sooo much from - well everyone I know to be honest.

First appearance - WHAT THE HELL....old? Greek? Roman? Big Chairs? Dark? I am NOT at a modern place right now, like not even the 20th century. Here's my coat check in lady - I must go explore...

Seated in a giant booth from 1965, I expected Ron Jeremy to start a show somewhere...and someone to bring me a brandy or something...But it was an interesting atmosphere and at least different from the recent norm of Calgary. I knew now I was being thrown back to the Calgary of old. A lovely gentleman of 102 years old is our server (clearly the first waiter they ever hired)..we all order Caesars to drink and debate if they were invented in this place (I think it was the Palliser in my opinion) and admire the glass room where a chef is able to properly cook steaks for the ENTIRE place at one time (and we were at capacity - its Christmas week after all). Well done chef, well done.

Orders are placed and I am told the fillet is pretty wicked (I don't see any \"special sauces\" to accompany? I am told it's not needed..but...I like.. ok.). The Caesar is decent (The Palliser is better..), the cheese break arrives. WTF? Who made this? WHAT IS THIS? I cannot stop...*nom nom* eating...Seems to be a fresh bread with an inch of parmesan, and then broiled, or something. I NEED THIS MAGICAL RECIPE. The lovely server then comes with French onion soup (shouldn't this man be on a pension?)..which is pretty awesome (he generously puts a huge spoonful more of cheese in it - HELLO!). Still admiring the chef cooking the steaks who seems to basically burn them all in huge flames-and I wonder how I am going to get a fillet that is BLACK from flame and cooked properly with no sauce. I have my hesitations.

The main arrives. It's the awaited fillet and a potato, I think? yes - a stuffed backed potato. I wonder how this will be...oh, Hi waiter, you have toppings.. yes please - ALL OF THEM (Sour Cream, onions, bacon bits)-generously added to this potato. First bite of this pota..WHAT IS THIS? Why is this so delicious?? Ok - so they have basically mastered the stuffed potato. Can I have another (*inside fat voice*). Let's try the fillet (I see juice running out of it..).. ok, ok.. it's literally delicious. The char is so good I don't know what to say. It's a perfect medium rare - there is no sauce, butter, flavor, nothing. It's my first piece of perfect beef, cooked perfectly, and without any form of doctoring. I'm quite impressed (great job man in the glass room). This steak is so juicy and perfect -I'll never be able to replicate on a BBQ of massive flames like he has. 

..I finish my meal with dessert. AND BY DESSERT I MEAN ANOTHER PIECE OF CHEESE BREAD. Ugh..I'll regret this later - but can't waste such deliciousness. Riiight?

Does Caesars live up to its expectations? I think so. It was really good. Is it my favourite place - meh, I have other favs. It's an old Calgary standard and I see how it survived 30 years and It will survive another 30. It does a GREAT meal."}
{"text":"Judging by reviews and menu prices, one may expect this place to be almost like Calgary's steak paramount...

Well, I would strongly disagree with that.

Actual quality of meat was amateurish. I am not kidding - any reasonably competent backyard BBQ'er should be able to prepare the meat as \"good\" as it is at Caesar's.

If you have any friends from South America, don't bring them there, they'd laugh and say something like \"these yanquis don't know a thing about meat\". I know, but all North Americans are yanks for them.

Anyways, when one asks for a \"well done\" steak and gets a chunk of bleeding, unevenly fried meat, that sucks. That's unprofessional. And medium-well looks the same, by the way - we actually compared the cuts.

Plus the cocky, unpleasant, almost rude service doesn't add anything to the poor quality of food. The place is crowded, all right, but that's not the reason to neglect your customers and not even look at them while taking orders.

Needless to say, empty wine and water glasses remain empty whatever number of waiters pass by your table. Zero interest in customer's needs, let alone the comfort.

Portions are small and ridiculously expensive for what they are (I don't hesitate chopping a thick bill in Bolero, but Caesar's? Give me a break!)

Never again.

PS: Oh, and the parking! A few spots for all that crowd inside - hoping for the remaining plaza spots to be used... Really?"}
{"text":"Spending the night in Calgary while on vacation, we decided to find a place to served Alberta beef. Caesar's was close to where we were staying a local, always my first choice. Indeed, the interior is a through back; the kind of place you'd expect to see on \"Mad Men\" when they take a trip to Vegas. Despite the cheese of the place, the service was friendly and efficient and they did steak very well. There were times we had a hard time understanding what our waiter was saying to us...he had a soft voice and spoke with a heavy accent. Although I love my T-Bone, my husband meat was not cooled properly to order. He had requested medium rare and it came to him medium well. Still, he thought is was good.

Overall, we got what we sought:  good Canadian beef in a one of a kind environment."}
{"text":"Easily five star...I didn't even know this place had a great rep. I happened on it by chance looking for a great steak. 

Not an ounce of disappointment. Everything was superb. My friend is a pescatarian and she enjoyed it immensely as well. 

No complaints. Can't wait to make it there again sometime."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky when it comes to my steak. I prefer it to be served 'medium' rather than the popular 'medium rare.' There's something about blood oozing out of the food I am about consume does not appeal to me. I have visited Caesar's downtown location on several occasions and quite frankly thought that there was only one in Calgary. I was pleased to discover their alternate location in the dirtay south (as my coworkers and I like to call it - it's really a hip hop reference...)

I was the first to arrive from my party of five and was greeted by a pleasant hostess who immediately took my coat. I informed her that this dinner was a farewell treat for my relatives who were leaving the city the next day and she reassured me she would inform our server. Our server was polite, professional and extremely patient as we hummed and ha-ed over the menu. I had the Emperor's Feast which consists of soup and salad to start, followed by a choice of five different steaks with another five different sides. You can see why it was difficult to choose! 

The soup was delicious; I love a great onion consume. The salad was average - drenched in dressing, where I prefer my greens to be lightly covered. My steak was cooked to perfection and right in front of us - the open flamed grill is located in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by ceiling to ground glass unit so patrons can witness the 'magic.' A good thing too if you have a phobia of your food being tampered with. We finished off our feast (good thing I was wearing stretchy pants!) by sharing homemade cheesecake and apple pie a-la-mode. The cheesecake was light and had a strong vanilla flavour to it; just the way I like it. I don't discriminate when it comes to apple pie, because really, how can anyone get it wrong? 

When it came time to pay the bill, the serve came straight to me. I was impressed with his ability to stand his ground, even with four other irritated guests shouting at him to pass the bill their way. He simply replied, \"I have strict orders that the bill was to go here.\" 

It was a great last supper before I started my detox. I can't wait to have my next steak!"}
