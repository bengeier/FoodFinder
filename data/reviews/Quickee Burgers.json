{"text":"Most rude and inconsiderate lil twerps I've ever encountered at a food establishment. The boys behind the counter were infuriating, who in there right mind would represent there restaurant like this?! Took 30 minutes to cook our 3 burgers, and as we watched they're every move, there were over 10 health code violations. They used the same gloves to form burger patties, use the register and cash, get ice from the machine in the lobby, and cook our meal. Disgusting!!!!!! We weren't even greeted or looked at upon entering, and I had to ask if we could place an order. As we left they said in the most rude and condescending way \"sorry about the wait, but we hope you loved our clean shop!\" All 3 of our burgers went in the garbage after that comment, and  we will never come close to coming here again. Pathetic and a sorry excuse of a restaurant! If I didn't have to rate this place it would get -5 stars!"}
{"text":"The service was a let down. The people were nice, but the rate at which our food came was slow. We ordered twelve sliders and three orders of fries, and we received that order after TWENTY minutes. We drove home (a three minute drive) and we opened our bags. Eight of our sliders came neatly packaged in styrofoam boxes, and our three fries underneath. At first we thought they got our order wrong, but we found the last four sliders UNDERNEATH the fries. As a result, the four burgers on the bottom were flat as pancakes and damp with grease because they were not put in a box. Our burgers were room temperature and our fries were slightly warm. I'm assuming that our burgers were made first and were sitting around until the fries were cooked. The burgers were good, very similar to White Castle and the fries were nice. The wait and the temperature were dissapointing however."}
{"text":"I liked the burgers and fries a lot. I only wish the establishment was bigger, but overall I enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Pts didn't have food here before so it's good to see they finally got something in there, and good bar food at that. The sliders are pretty good and we were pleasantly surprised to see they had a veggie burger too."}
{"text":"Burgers were incredible. Fries were the best I've had in a long time. The gentleman working behind the counter was very friendly. I will DEFINITELY be going back"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place. I'm orginally from the Midwest and miss White Castle dearly. I'm sorry to say that this place hardly comes close. The burgers weren't that great tasting and despite just coming off a grill it was sort of cold (I ate one as soon as I got in the car) I was also expecting it to be in its own building with a drive thru but that wasn't a huge deal. I definitely wouldn't hesitate to make another trip if the food was good. The girl that took our order was really nice though. She had a short hair cut I should have gotten her name but unless something changes I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The sliders are tasteless. The fries are lukewarm. The sign shows a 22oz soda but you get a 12oz can. The brown bag is covered in grease. There was an uncooked fry in the bottom of the bag. The slider wrappers were also covered in grease. Not worth the drive to BFE. The counter clerk said they are just like White Castle burgers, false advertising."}
{"text":"The burgers were okay at best. The fries were extremely too salty for me, and I enjoy really salty fries. They are twice as salty as Mcdonalds fries if that gives you an idea. Over all the food TASTE wasn't bad. 

The food poisoning that everyone got from the food, however, was. Three people ate it, three people each got food poisoning. I'll never eat here again."}
{"text":"Just terrible.  Took 2 hours to get my food by then the food was cold and stale.  Asked for a discount offered more crappy burgers.  This was the worst."}
{"text":"Gone for good, doesn't exist, don't buy a groupon!! Dont even bother going into this pt's location...unless your in the mood for some table games."}
{"text":"We went to Quickee Burgers for the first time last night... My boyfriend got 4 burgers (Bronson) and I got a shake. He loooooooved his burgers and my shake was to die for. The man at the register was a hoot! He turned my grumpy face frown upside down. He was so pleasant and energetic. So funny! We will definitely be going back. Do not let that fact that this little joint is inside of a gas station... That's kind of what gives it it's special gem charm. A little hidden treasure!"}
{"text":"Nothing to impressed, but not bad either. Just food. I think more for kids. Its 5 bucks for some small burgers & fries."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with couple of friends, stoped the day before but they were already closed. We all ordered  the brown bag special -4 burgers, fries and a coke-we added cheese . Everyone enjoyed them. They are white castle style burgers. better than some of the other fastfood burgers in this town. They were cooked fresh, had onion  and pickle, perfect for what they are. The shop is located  in a gas station, but so what, they have their own little area. A single burger is .69 with cheese .89.  Worth a try for a quick burger meal. My only suggestion  to them is to stay open late. They would make a great after bar food. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I noticed the location on Pebble and Eastern was closed. Hopefully this is not the case.  Really want to try this place."}
{"text":"Ummmmm. Well I went to PTs hoping to get my buzz on and go home with a nice pizza to devour then hate myself later . It's Friday night and that's what I do, and I was just trying to get home in time for dateline . Anyways , I start gambling get a drink or 2 before ordering to find out , this pts (trop and 95) doesn't have the glorious pts food and they rented out their kitchen to quickee burger . Whatever . Feed me . 

So I order a brown bag special ( 3 or 4? Sliders and fries . And mozzarella sticks . I was buzzed and any food would be good . But now I'm at home drunk and this shit is sad. The fries are burnt . No seasoning . SALT nothing . Sliders  flavorless DRY as ballllllls . . Mozz sticks u can't fuck up and still not special . So basically I spent 12 dollars to eat crap as dry and cardboard tasting like the Vegas desert . It's like eating dry toast off a cactus .

A McDonald's mcgangbang ( put a double cheeseburger inside a hot n spicy .... Trust me) for 3 bucks would have been a better investment . 


The staff was nice tho . But sorry your food sucks . This is why I need to stick to tall cans and my own food"}
{"text":"I work down the street and finally drove up for lunch today. To my disappointment, they were CLOSED. The manager of the gas station said that they just didn't show up. Lame. Sorry for the one star, maybe when they're actually open they'll deserve better."}
{"text":"So they don't answer their phones and then I go there at 5:30 and a sign says they're closed from 5-6 , well it would have been nice to know that... Won't be returning and I haven't even tried the food."}
{"text":"These little burgers were awful!! Fries are extremely salty. No thanks.
Also, not worth the price.
I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Well after reading all the terrible comments about this place, i went to check it out- The place had a Lock Out Notice on the door- guess the Landlord wasn't impressed either"}
{"text":"So I went to check this place out and was surprised as it is located inside of the am/pm at the corner of Craig and Rancho. The location could be a lot better but the burger and fries more than make up for it! The fries taste great, They are light and crispy with a good salt ratio. The burgers are very simple (patty, grilled onions, cheese, and a pickle) Although very simple they are great! They have a white castle vibe and when they are hot they are down right addicting! I see these guys coming up in the future, They could add some different cheese options (pepperjack, swiss, maybe?) Just to set themselves apart from white castle. That is going to be a big thing as I really do think they have a white castle thing going on at least with their burgers for that matter (not a bad thing) Either way I have to say that I will be back and will enjoy these quicker burgers as they are fun to eat and where else can you get a piece of birthday cake with your burger?"}
{"text":"I really really was hoping to give this place a great rating, but I am unable to. Whoever says these burgers taste like White Castle, has obviously never had a \"Real White Castle Burger'. Even though they were cooked fresh, they tasted old. The Red Velvet Birthday Cake really gives you the \"Birthday Feeling\" as it tasted like melted wax candle. Not sure if they use a cream cheese base frosting, but it tasted kinda off. Everyone is different, and you may like it. I for one, will not be going back. Time to bust out the tums. My stomach feels like it is just about to let loose. #gross!!!"}
{"text":"have been here a few times with groupons, its not bad,,,def. not white castle, but my
boys have no problem devouring the burgers fries and shakes, and when I don't wanna cook ...this works for me..lol.  everyone was very pleasant and the food was cooked when I ordered it. Don't expect gourmet stuff...it is what it is."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but the tiny White Castle-esque burgers have good flavor. The fries are also spot-on: skinny and salty and a tiny bit limp.  Pricing is fair and they currently have a Groupon up.

Location leaves a lot to be desired- yes, it's in a gas station convenience store. But it's also kind of a seedy intersection and a run-down plaza, with a vaguely dirty store. The Quickee area also is oddly blocked off with dine-in counters but no stools?

Not sure if I was shorted the drink with my #2 combo or if it somehow doesn't come with one, but adding cheese is essential to maintaining the WC taste. $6 for the four-piece meal is not a bad lunch."}
{"text":"Ok so I haven't had the opportunity to try anything else but their shake.  The black & white shake was so delicious!!! I will be back to try their red velvet...and maybe their burger? You pay for what you get right? However, the shakes are a must get for the price you pay!!!  The shake has this flavor that takes you back in time during the good old days where cold stone, baskin Robbins, and all the other ice cream joints didn't exist."}
{"text":"Seen the advertisement on FB and they said they were better than white castle so my family and I decided to check it out. Save your money and time! My family ordered the score its 24 cheeseburgers with 4 fries for 22.99, when the food came (took about 15 minutes) half the burgers were cold other half semi luke warm, maybe because they have 1 small grill to work on. Fries were very salty, told one of the employees, she was very nice and remade them. I would never come back, I gave them 2 stars because the employees were nice. I will stick to white castle even now since they just opened a location Vegas"}
{"text":"Ordered from Grub hub today and wasn't sure what to expect. We werent disappointed when the food showed up. 

The burgers are exactly what we were expecting very similar to white castle sliders. Pretty tasty though. The real winners though was the fries they were easily some of the best fries I've had in a long time. 

For the price this is some damn good food."}
{"text":"This place is terrible! Save your money and go anywhere else! This place has been open for a few months now and after seeing it on Groupon, I decided to give it a try. When I looked up the location, I realized it was located inside the Arco gas station on Craig and Rancho...that should have been the first red flag right there. When I presented my Groupon, I was told that it couldn't be accepted because their Groupon system was down. Ok....but I have the paper print out right here...But still the cashier refused. After some convincing, along with a few choice words he accepted my Groupon and I placed my order.

About 5-10 min later, I received my order which was pretty reasonable given that the cashier appeared to be the only one working at this joint. It's pretty much a hole in the wall at the back of the gas station convenience store and isn't a pretty place at all. The only good thing is that their prices are dirt cheap, however, the food is garbage and basically inedible. Expect to get your order to go because there is only enough counter space/stools for maybe 4 people.

I'm not sure how anybody can mess up a burger/slider but they managed to. Their sliders are so bland and the meat is so low quality I lost my appetite. Their fries would be decent if they weren't over-salted but they put so much salt on them that it was basically a salt lick. The shakes are terrible too...they basically tasted like a concoction of ice and milky water - bleh! I barely ate any of my food before I stopped and trashed it all. It's absolute crap and disgusting. If there were an award for Worst of Las Vegas, this would be my #1 pick.

I would not come back even if the food were free and would never recommend this place to anybody, unless you're purchasing it to feed it to a dog or something..."}
{"text":"Tried this place out after hearing about it on FB and from friends. They're burgers are MEH. They are pretty bland and we found ourselves having to add condiments and whatnot to make it taste yummy. I did like their chili cheese fries a lot so I will back for those. Not the greatest but it's not very pricey so that's a plus."}
{"text":"It is what it is, a gas station burger place.  Slightly better than a gas station microwave burrito but not much better.  Made our stomachs hurt but at least I know where to go if I am constipated.  I was going to give you 3 stars but the employees working without gloves lost you a star."}
{"text":"This is a poor mans White Castle. The staff is very nice but it looks like everything is frozen or comes from a can, probably won't return."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try their burgers so we made the 30 min drive. I was shocked to find out that they were in a dirty gas station. To play it safe I ordered one before I ordered for the whole family. Took a bite and it tasted like a microwaved burger super gross. We ended up driving to in and out totally disappointed..."}
{"text":"Ok so we tried this place for the first time today. I saw that there was a groupon deal so we used that. They are located inside the Arco gas station. Small window type place with 2 bar seats available to eat there. 

Their sliders are supposed to be like White Castle.. Very similar look, they come with onions and pickles. You have a choice of cheese or no cheese. 

I so wanted to love these burgers. I can't say that I did. The patties tasted plain, cheap, and frozen.  I had to add mustard and ketchup to disguise the taste of the patties a little. The vanilla milk shake reminded me of a frosty vanilla pudding. Nothing amazing. 

This place has potential and a great idea. Maybe some tweaks in the food will bring them to the next level. The service was fast and friendly. The gentleman that helped me seemed to be really excited and enthused about the business. Kitchen/counter area looked clean. It's more of a 2.5 review, just for the friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! The patties are juicy, onions are grilled perfectly, cheese melts great, and buns are perfectly toasted and still soft inside! We also had the please of meeting the owner and he was awesome! Thanks for the great food and great service!"}
{"text":"Quickee Burgers? More like \"Yucky Burgers\". 

Let me explain. I saw this advertised on Facebook so I was intrigued. I was thinking it couldnt be any worse than White Castle right? Well, it was about the same tastewise but what happened after my experience there was laughable.

Let's start with my initial visit. With an open mind I wanted to see if they are better than WC. If you refer to my pictures, they look eerily similar to my WC pics. I got the QB #2 which are 3 sliders, fries and a drink for 5.99. Not a bad deal. Since I wanted to try the chicken slider I requested to have one of the burgers substituted. It was at this point that the cashier asked the owner whose name is Michael, if it was possible. He agreed and said it was an upcharge which was understandable. First impression was that I thought he seemed pretty nice. Until he started joking around with me that he would only do it if I hooked him up with any one of my Asian lady friends. I wasnt offended at first but as the conversation went on I thought it got kind of awkward.

So fast forward to the meal. If you refer to my pictures, the look and taste was the same as WC. The fries sucked. It was dry and salty. I couldnt seem to find anything appealing about my meal. The only thing that warranted praise was that they had the one coke machine that has a lot of soda choices and that the chicken slider was kind of decent meaning I was able to finish it. Im sorry I coudnt say the same for the regular slider. One bite and I struggled to swallow it.

When I left, in my mind it was a 2 star review. Well here's what happened  before I started doing this review. I saw the ad again on Facebook. He was basically offering people a free brown bag lunch if  they were selected after tagging somebody. Well I commented that I didnt think that the slider was any better than WC and that the chicken slider was ok. Minutes later my comment was removed and I was blocked from commenting. If you cant handle the truth I guess block the person that speaks it? Well then, try blocking this dude. All you did was make it worse. Instead of two stars you lost one. If you are going to be an owner, you need to learn how to deal with constructive criticism. Instead you delete my comment and based off of what some people have told me after eating there, the way you treat your customers is rude and inapropriate as I found out for myself. The proof is also in your replies to some of the reviews on here. 

In closing, whatever sliver of hope you had with me coming back and recommending you to my friends is gone. As a matter of fact, to be fair to you, if my friends ask me about you, I will tell them to try you first, then we will talk. My intention is not to put you out of business, but if your product is not good and you treat your customers rudely, dont be surprised if nobody shows up. I would say after about 6 months or so, I will check out some recent legit reviews. If it looks like you have improved, then I just might come back and verify. I wanted to try the shakes but rude service will always negate that. Until then, try blocking this review dude.

{"text":"Should update your business. 
Lucky I did not buy groupon. 
We decided to stop in and business is gone."}
{"text":"Love me some sliders, and the fries are awesome! Would be nice if there was a place to sit, but still worth 5-stars from a value and flavor standpoint"}
{"text":"Okay yes. I am spoiled by White Castle cause I'm originally from Chicago. I did however, keep an open mind when visiting this place and I drove all the way from Henderson for the experience.

No matter how I tried, I could'nt come up with a reason to come back to this establishment.

The location is dismal ( in a really dirty gas station ) , no parking, nor drive thru and no indoor seating.

Upon arriving I placed my order and was not given drink cups, and had to get directions on how to get a drink cup from another customer.  Food comes in nondescript white and brown paper bags. No logo or anything to indicated where this food is from on any packaging. This should'nt matter though if it is good.

It was mildly remeniscient of sliders from White Castle but we had one customer in front of us and two behind and still had to wait ten minutes for our food.  This made me think that at least it would be fresh. NOPE!  Stone cold and dry!

Anyway, so come to find out that there was a man standing about four feet from me the whole time.  I thought he was either a loiterer or just an obnoxious patron dressed like a street person.  Come to find out he is the owner and he made it his focus to offend all seven people in the place before they left.  WOW!

If you want to be disrespected and sold low standard food go there. Otherwise, wait for the real deal in the future when White Castle opens on the strip.

I really wanted this to be a good experience cause I love sliders, but... Oh well!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and I definately would have it everything wasn't so salty. Fries were completely unedible with all that salt and the burger meat was heavily salted too.  My suggestion for this business would be to get new salt shakers, (maybe the holes are too big on the ones they are using) or offer a salt free alternative. Shake was very good no complaints there."}
{"text":"I requested a grilled cheese (as it is Friday during Lent) and was told that would not be possible. Apparently it's against company standards. 

I wasn't requesting someone catch and skin a fish for me, I was simply asking for a meatless option at the same price as a typical cheeseburger. 

I work real hard for little bit of change that's left in my pocket at the end of the day. With that being said, if your business isn't willing to accommodate my request I will take my coins some place else. 

Girl bye."}
{"text":"The fries are way to salty. I had to stop eating them or I would gag on salt. I have never had that salty of any food anywhere, gross. Ease up on the salt. Burgers were just ok."}
{"text":"Their wings are awesome !! One of the best I've had. The service is great. Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"This place is closed. I ordered from Grub Hub, went to pick it up, and it's blocked off inside of the gas station. Grub Hub called me to check if I'd gotten my food and then took them offline. Bummer that they're still listed as open!"}
{"text":"This Quickee just opened up and despite some issues it has  potential. 

I stopped by a few days ago thanks to a $3 groupon I picked up. Upon walking in the place was a ghost town. Nobody was there but the tables and restaurant were surprisingly dirty. I presented my groupon and the cashier quickly explained what I can get: one small chicken slider, one small regular slider, side of fries and a drink. On the menu the combo is worth about $5 which doesn't sound bad but the amount of food you get is minuscule. The burger slider was alright, nothing special; the chicken slider was delicious and worth getting again. The fries were surprisingly good and fresh. 

The menu is pretty basic: sliders, fries, shakes and a few combos. You can place a 'bulk' order for the sliders and pick up 20 of them. The touch screen coke machine for drinks was virtually empty. They only had diet versions of a hand full of drinks which was pretty disappointing. 

Overall it wasn't a bad experience but hopefully the issues are resolved and they start giving you a bit more food for your money."}
{"text":"Just awful.  I picked up two dozen to bring to my work for some friends.  I was super excited about them, but once we opened the  box it was just full of disappointment.  The sliders were not made consistently.  Some of my sliders barely had any meat in them.  Some were really salty, while some tasted like nothing.  I don't think I want to come back.  There are much better restaurants in that plaza, go check those out."}
{"text":"I read about this place on Yelp and really wanted to try it.  Even though White Castle is here in Vegas, this place is very close to my house and I love going to new restaurants.  I'll admit I was a bit scared by the negative reviews and the sociopathic replies of the owner on both Yelp pages for the two Quickee locations (seriously, the guy appears to be a step away from being one of the owners of Amy's Baking Company).

The first things I noticed when I went in at lunchtime on a weekday were that the place had no customers, some of the tables only had 1 seat while others had 2, 3, or 4 seats, and everything was impeccably clean.

I ordered a cheeseburger, chicken sandwich, and fries.  First off, anyone who says the taste is like White Castle is wrong -- not that the burgers need to taste like White Castle to be good.  White Castle sliders have thin beef that covers the whole light and airy bun.  Quickee sliders have slightly thicker beef and the patty does not fully cover the bun, which is a bit thicker as well.  The burger was very bland, dry, and dominated by the taste of the American cheese on it.  A bigger patty or better seasoning would do wonders.

The chicken sandwich tasted better at first, but I must have gotten a bad one because there were 3 pretty big pieces of gristle in it.  The fries were good -- no complaints here.  All-in-all I'd say my experience is slightly below average.  I probably won't go back again unless there is a significant change in the quality of the burgers/chicken."}
{"text":"The first time  I came they closed early for some reason so I decided to give them another chance earlier in the day.    Today the unfriendly cashier waited until I paid for my food to tell me they were out of diet coke.  Actually I had to say \"what about my drink\" and then she let me know they only had coke.   They have no customer service skills and are extremely slow.


Well the rude reply from the  \"owner\" certainly doesn't  help.  It's a dead issue as far as I'm concerned because I will never give this place another penny.  However, the employees shouldn't say \"we just ran out\" of something you do not carry."}
{"text":"I have now been here many times (**so much so that ive almost filled my punch card for dozens..yipes!). The service is always great and the staff is super friendly. These delicious little cheeseburgers of delight, I cant get enough of! Its almost dangerous that they are about a 45second drive from my house...so easy to swing by. If you havent..check this place out!"}
{"text":"Really not too much of a great comparison to White Castle (even the frozen ones).  I give it 2 1/2 stars, although I went opening week so maybe quality assurance is better now.

Was excited to hear we had some White Castle 'competition' coming to town with Quickee Burgers.  As a note, there is no actual Quickee Burgers restaurant - to find it you will have to jaunt into the AM/PM on the corner of Craig and Rancho (home of the same strip mall where you can get great Thai food (albeit in a bar)).  Quickee Burgers is located inside in a small area.  Really only takeout, no real seating anywhere unless they add a few stools eventually.  So order, take home, or eat standing up.

Found the Groupon that would feed two folks for $10, but we managed to stretch it for four.  Comes with 10 Quickee Burgers with cheese, 2 orders of fries, and 2 milkshakes (we opted for Black & White - combo of vanilla and chocolate).  We also picked up a free slice of Red Velvet birthday cake when checking in with Yelp (not sure if that's still available).  Order was in quick, but prep was really slow.  Granted it was grand opening and folks were still trying to learn how to communicate with each other.  After a 15 minute wait, our order was ready to go.

Honestly really disappointed with the quality of Quickee Burgers burgers.  They are a tad larger than the ones from White Castle, but damn were they pretty flavorless.  Buns were good but on the cold side, would have helped with a warming on the grill.  Burgers?  Dry as a bone, and lacked so much flavor.  Would have been a benefit if they cooked it like White Castle does, poke holes in the burgers so the steam from the grilled onions below moisten and flavor the patty.  Easily, our patties were all overcooked and lifeless.  I'm really not sure if they even used salt & pepper on them!  Condiments were the norm - cheese was some sort of cheddar (although it was bordering on Kraft singles), some onion bits, pickle, mustard & ketchup.  But still overall the burger was dry.  I ended up adding some mayo to mine to get them back up to par.

Fries were OK though.  Thin, salty, but not quite cooked enough.  All got limp before we got home.  Maybe a bit more time in the oil would have made them much better.  But the taste was good.  Shakes were pretty mediocre.  Shakes were too light from having too much air in the mixing machine.  Not close to a thick shake at all, but like cheap soft serve.  Plus it was cloyingly sweet!  Really had an artificial taste to them, probably from their shake mix.  Wasn't my favorite.  Although it looked super cheesy, the Red Velvet birthday cake was actually pretty good.  It's just a plain sheet cake covered in birthday frosting, but the cake itself was moist.  

Was a good effort Quickee Burgers.  But I think I will stick to waiting until White Castle actually comes to Las Vegas (soon baby, soon).  Or I will just opt to buying the frozen ones from my local warehouse store and reheat them in a pan.  Unless the quality of your burger improves by a few bounds, I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon.  Taste, I need taste!

THE QUICK & THE DEAD."}
{"text":"I didn't have the food - I couldn't get past the \"server\". The burgers must be made in advance to sit and wait as I couldn't get them without cheese. On top of that - with no other customers in the site, the \"chef\" had over 20 burgers on the grill. If you want dried up, old food, go here. Otherwise, even burger king will make the burger when you order it."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place on Facebook I finally decided to try em out since they opened up around the corner.

I ordered a dozen burgers, regular fries, and the chili cheese fries.

The service was great I was greeted with a smile, and she was really nice.  Ordered the food to go, and surprisingly it was still hot when I got home.

Now for the food, the sliders themselves were MEH, the regular order of fries were lukewarm and not fresh, the chili cheese fries were also MEH, they have a spice to em that makes it sweet and i can't quite place it i wanna say it's an Asian/Indian spice and wasn't expecting that, but it was a decent amount of fries and chili enough for 2 people maybe 3.

Overall I wouldn't go out my way to try them again even if they are around the corner, the service was excellent the food was whatever, maybe I'll try em again in a few months if they are still around.

Also it was pretty dead, and I highly doubt they were made to order I was in and out in less than 5 minutes, but the place was clean.

They get 3 stars for the service if I had to base it off the food it would be 1 star"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. 30 minutes later, the delivery and order were canceled. I understand it if you are a little short staffed, but let me know within 5 minutes of taking my order. I placed the order because I was hungry. 30 minutes after the order was canceled, you are still showing as available for delivery on the Eat24 app. Get it together."}
{"text":"It's my second visit to Quickee Burgers - had the brown bag special which includes 4 mini burgers, fries and a drink. The Quickee Burgers has relocated to 3231 North Decatur in the same outdoor strip mall as DIY Flavor Shack. 

Fast and friendly service. 

White Castles fans may like this one better - these are slightly bigger and better burgers in my opinion. 

I will have to try the chicken - Quickee Chickee and chilee fries next.

This place is backed by Mike Tyson , Vince Neil, Ian Ziering and Michael Politz (who happened to be there the first time I was at the Quickee Burger.

If you are looking for a good Quickee lunch or dinner go to  Quickee Burgers."}
{"text":"Seen this establishment listed on Groupon, didn't think I could eat ten hamburgers so thought I would stop by and purchase a few. Got a single, a double, fries, and a chocolate shake. Cheeseburgers tasted exactly like White Castle. Call me crazy but the same great taste. This place is in the minimart which is a horrible location with no seating. The chocolate shake is just a vanilla shake with chocolate syrup on top. With that said the burgers, shake and fries were awesome. Cheeseburgers are only 69 cents. I wish they had a drive thru. They also have a 5.00 box, 4 burgers, fries and a drink. I will be back!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you plan on purchasing A groupon keep in mind that it does not work for online ordering. also you cannot make changes to any order that uses a Groupon so if you have allergies to anything that comes on the burger probably shouldn't purchase or use the Groupon. Cash only inside the store. Good luck"}
{"text":"Went tonight like we did last week to get a dozen sliders no cheese for 7.99 plus tax . I went to pay and the guy said that will 10 something !!! What I said your sign says 7.99 !! He said that they are now 9.99 plus tax !! I said the sign clearly states 12 quickie burgers without cheese for 7.99 . He would not budge !!! I told him I did not want the sliders if they would not give me the advertised price . This did not seem fair to me ? So I left without my sliders !! So Quickie you lost a good customer !!!"}
{"text":"so I tried this after picking up some hookah supplies since they are in the same shopping center
lets me say this worst mistake ever 
fries were stale and salty 
burgers tasted like it was left in the freezer for a long time the after taste was just weird. no reason to come back here 
and to be honest since white castle opened up here in vegas there really isnt a reason to come here unless your going to get gas from arco 

BTW has anyone else noticed the owner actually replies to these?
dude hire some knew cooks on the real 

oh yea this is my first review mainly because Ive never had this bad of an experience anywhere else"}
{"text":"Nothing like having multiple things go wrong the first time you visit a place.

I came here pretty much an hour after they opened.  I had a groupon to order 24 burgers, 4 orders of fries, and something like 4 cakes.

I was told right off the bat that they didn't have any fries. I asked if a fries to burger ratio could be worked out. 

I had the notion of getting the burgers made fresh with no pickles, but that also wasn't in the cards today. I was told between a recently made big order, and not getting their supply shipment yet, I wouldn't be able to get any freshly made burgers without pickles. 

Fortunately, the cashier and I was able to work out a decent fries to burger ratio, and she threw in a couple of extra burgers and cakes.

The burgers tasted like frozen then microwaved White Castle. The red velvet cakes tasted like they were grocery store sheet cakes. I honestly think they were since they had happy birthday type decorative frosting on it.

I went in not expecting much from the food, it all tasted like I expected it to. Frozen patty burgers in a gas station. There were some unforeseeable snags but good customer service made up for it. I won't go out of my way to eat here again, but I might swing by if I am in the area, hungry, and strapped for cash."}
{"text":"Had a Groupon for what looked like a Fast Food Restaurant. Instead my GPS takes me to PT's bar. We walk in anyway and there's nothing resembling a restaurant side. The bar tender sees us but doesn't say anything.  
We just ended up leaving and getting a credit back from Groupon. 

Not sure what was going on there. This Groupon is false advertising when they don't tell you it's in a bar."}
{"text":"I went back to give this place another shot because I don't want to just give up on a new business after one mediocre experience. This time I ended up just leaving without buying any food because they've apparently changed their rules and can not make any modifications to the burgers. I'm not sure if the cashier was just being lazy or if that really is the norm now. Please... this is a food establishment, people have food allergies! You won't get very far if you're unwilling to make exceptions."}
{"text":"So Heres The Thing People have to expect about this place. I think the food is pretty good its nothing special but i have to say i love the prices. For me and the wifey we both got the 4 sliders Fries and a drink meal. it came out to $12.95 and it was a perfect portion of food. Its definitely comparable to the famous white castle and taste almost exactly the same as the microwave burgers with a toasted bun. The only thing is they need to be more organized and thats  staff related so dont pass this up  because once they fix that it will probably get a 4 star rating from me. So the people in front of me ordered like 30 sliders and the one before me ordered like 20. So for 3 people to make 50 sliders before they get to mine its definitely understandable that its going to take a while. So all you people that get upset that you're not getting your Quickee Burger fast just think before you write a bad review. The best thing of the night was one of the guys came out to apologize for the wait and asked if there was anything he can provide us with on the house I actually asked for chilli cheese fries and he came out with a full order for free which by the way the chilli cheese fries were good its beanless chili with nacho cheese on top. Thank you for doing that because it definitely makes me feel like you cared about how long i waited to eat. I will be back to give this place a second chance to earn your fourth Star Stay Tuned YELPERS.."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a higher rating because of the fabulous young lady that took our order, but unfortunately the food wasn't that good.

Quickee is located inside the ARCO gas station on the corner of Rancho and Craig.  Believe me....this is a prime location for some people watching...if you know what I mean!

The menu is limited to cheeseburgers, fries, can soda and a \"black and white\", which is their version of a shake.  The cheeseburgers are small, like White Castle.  They have onions, pickles, cheese and mustard on them. 

For fast food, I guess they were ok.  They don't hold a \"fry\" to In&Out burgers for sure.  The bread got too soggy and the patty was pretty flavorless. The fries came out lukewarm and weren't anything above average in taste.

The service was great though and we were in and out within 10 minutes.   The best thing was the shake.  I would go back for one of them, if I got the hankering for a shake again.  I wouldn't return to this location after dark, however.  :/"}

There is a sign from the landlord locking them out.
