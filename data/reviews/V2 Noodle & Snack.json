{"text":"great joint to grab a quick bowl of homemade noodle soup with your choice of toppings! toppings vary from shrimp wonton, tenderous ribs, beef, shrimp dumplings and cuttlefish balls. maximum is 3 toppings since the bowls are pretty small and they'll only give you 2 pieces of each serving. i always get 2 toppings since the noodles always seem to fill me up with my fav toppings which are the cuttlefish balls and shrimp dumplings. the cuttlefish balls are to die for! so crunchy and flavourful! the servers here can't speak english very well so when ordering you might have to be patient and speak slowly to them. I enjoy eating here because it is freshly made with little fat, oil and MSG but it still tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"I went there on Friday night and there was only a few customers inside.  My hubby ordered beef brisket, fish balls and dumpling with rice noodle, and I ordered cuttlefish balls, beef tender and wonton with noodle.  Also we had a deep fried tofu as well.  After 15-20 mins our tofu finally arrived (I wondered how come the food takes so long)  The only thing we know the waitress kept chatting in front of the stove while cooking......anyway the tofu taste great, hot, crispy but not oily, and the sauce is good.  Then after 5 mins then comes our noodle, my cuttlefish balls is yummy and so as the noodle.  But my hubby's ordered just mess up, comes out he had regular noodle not the rice noodle and no fish balls, instead they gave him something else.  I really wonder how can they messed up his order with only a few customers in the store......anyway we found out the main cook (probably the owner) is away while we ordered and after he was back, things run smoothly....."}

{"text":"Definitely would not come back again.

Bad service - we came on a weekend night at around 6pm which is early for Asian dinners, and they were out of certain dishes already! How on earth? 

There were no other people in the restaurant except for us.

The food we had ordered was dry, not flavourful and though cheap, you definitely get what you paid for: bad food."}
