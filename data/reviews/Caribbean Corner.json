{"text":"Small little Jamaican food store in Kensington.  Owned by Jamaicans the store had authentic ingredients.  The staff we're very friendly and welcoming.  I was stopping by to see if they had any callaloo patties as those are hard to find in Toronto.  No dice, but did manage to buy a coconut drops just for the fun of it.  The store is clean, well organized, and full of fresh food.   I didn't see any wilting produce or food that just shouldn't be on display.  I will definitely return if I am in the are, if not to grab some groceries, then to chat with the nice people who own the place."}
{"text":"i went in one day while walking around Kensington. The people alone, who work there and run the store, are the reason ill continue shopping with Caribbean Corner. Nicest and most welcoming owners. You get that now-a-days."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Jamaican food ingredients, in downtown Toronto, you will probably make your way into Kensington Market (or be directed there). 

Once you enter; the narrow, often car-free streets are always busy with a diverse range of people from hippie types flocking to the Hot Box Cafe and the plethera of vintage stores to locals buying the city's cheapest produce in the countless market shops and anyone who's in the know about cheap fresh baked goods and Cheese!!

Getting back to Caribbean Corner, located on Baldwin, it is fairly easy to find and situated right next door to another Caribbean food shop but don't be fooled, they are not the same or affiliated in any way and Caribbean Corner is the better of the two.

Here you can find everything from jonny cake mix to pumkin spice soup ingredients to pikapeppa sauce, crushed pepper sauce, bun and cheese and more (more, more).

If you're not Jamaican,  you may be charged a little more when you first start shopping there but don't be discouraged, they eventually do warm up to all their customers and I highly recommend checking out this authentic little shop!"}
{"text":"We have been wondering where one goes to by such things as \"Jerk\" spice. There is such a large community of Islanders here in Toronto I knew there has to be a \"Silk Road\" of sorts.
Here is one. A small treasury of spices and other necessities. Follow your nose to Caribbean Corner."}
{"text":"I love to visit and give my business to Caribbean Corner. They have a great selection of different island food items and ingredients, and tons of Caribbean charm in their tiny little space. I come here to buy my plantains, which I have been addicted to the past couple months.. fried plantains. That's another story. Anyhow, I spent just over a month in the Caribbean this spring and to come in to this store.. if I didn't look outside, I could swear I was back there. I would highly suggest stopping in to check out their selection.. Especially, if you are looking to add some Caribbean flavour to your kitchen!"}
