{"text":"I tried this place because I had seen a add on Facebook . This place was not that great I'm better of going to panda bear express . Service was great but food was not . Will never go back"}
{"text":"I had to put one start because its an obligation, although we were greeted and seated quickly and our server was very friendly and attentive,i have to say the food was very disatisfaing, they have faulse advertising their menu shows picture that have nothing to do with the actual served food we ordered the yum tom soup which show large shrimp only to recieve 6 tiny rubbery shrimp, the shumai was the size of bite size snickers  and had no shrimp it was a paste of some sort with no flavor,and during out dinner there we dont know what happened but our order was not placed correctly even though we told our waiter our order and saw her write it down we were awkardly waiting for the rest of our food to arrive only to find out she never put in our full order to the chef to begin with, as we decided at that point to leave, i asked out waitress \"excuse me did you write down our order\" she said \" yes\" when i asked her to look at what we had ordered she said \"oh, im sorry. i didnt write it down did you still want it?\" That maid us feel so furious since we had been waiting for along time just to find out that it was never coming we feel ripped off and it was just so awkard to sit there and wait for food you initially ordered but was never placed! We left and will never ever return, and we dont recommend this place to anyone! 99th ave and peoria! Please dont go! Food is not worth it we feel like we paid $ 45 for nasty, cheap food! Facebbok followers please dont write faulse reviews im a chinesse food lover but this is one of the worst place ive ever been to!"}
{"text":"I'm no Chinese food expert but my tongue knows what it likes. And it likes this place. Live in the area so decided to give it a shot and order take out. Orange chicken was crispy and tasty. Egg drop soup was rich and savory. Staff was very friendly. Also great lunch time special prices. Lots of tasty and filling  food for a low price; I'm looking forward to trying more of the menu!  Edit: Kung pao chicken wasn't very good. Had no kick and sauce was thin"}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend and wish I had come here on my first day, because I would have come back the next.  Great, flavorful, fresh food.  The dining room was nice and comfortable yet still casual.  The staff was very friendly and clearly proud of the restaurant and the menu.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Being from New York and having travelled all thru Asia, I'm very familiar with Asian food. Oriental House has absolutely THE BEST food I have found in Las Vegas in the 21 years I've resided here. The food is always fresh and delicious.The family that owns and operates it are very efficient and give friendly service.  If you haven't  dined here, you are really missing out on a wonderful dining experience.                                                You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love Chinese food, and I have been to many regular restaurants as well as buffets.  Believe me, this is some of the BEST Chinese food around in a very nice atmosphere and delightful help.    I usually have Orange Chicken, which was just so scrumptious awhile ago and, did I mention, you can have brown rice at no extra charge!  I don't know where these people come up with their bad reviews, because it is just not the case.  Believe me, I am disabled old fart and I have no time nor reason but to be anything but honest!  Yes, there may be a few dishes not quite up to snuff, but I can tell you the orange chicken, the lemon chicken which is like a schnitzel, curry beef, vegetable or chicken egg foo young, chicken fried rice, etc.  They are new to the area, so please give them a try or a second change; you won't be sorry.  Oh, and the egg drop and my fav hot and sour soup are very good as well.  We've even been in the other room at the large table with the lazy Susan as  had 4 people; and everyone said they would be back!!!  Thanks  //Steve"}
{"text":"We accidentally just stumbled upon this place and was hesitant at first, but was really hungry and decided to stay. I'm really glad we did because our experience was very positive.   First thing we noticed was the outstanding customer service. It's family owned/run and it shows in all aspects of the service we received. The Food was equally exceptional as well. I ordered the dumplings and the duck noodle soup and both turned out really great. Everything is handmade (and hence the higher price than usual), and it shows in the quality of their food.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place & great food. The owner Peter was a gracious host & gave us a delicious complimentary house salad. Very nice & friendly atmosphere & deliciouse food to boot. Deff recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the orange honey duck. It was quite good. Just the right amount of fat. Very crispy. Full of flavor. Will definitely come back.   Also, owner was very hospitable. I came back to pick up my food, and it wasn't ready yet. He offered me a coke, and gave me a seat in the restaurant to wait."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing!! If you like authentic oriental food this is the place to visit! Service was lightning fast and phenomenal. Ask for Peter when you visit for 5 star service!"}
{"text":"This little gem is right around the corner from home. The food is spectacular, the Thai tea is perfect, the service is prompt and courteous, and the prices are very reasonable.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I Love the Staff :) they're so Sweet!!!.. The Food is Great!!!... I Love the Hanan Chicken (lunch Special) the sauce is Delicious!!.."}
{"text":"Update: I always try to give a second chance...so I decided to try the takeout.    I used the Beyond Menu app...which you can access on the website. It made ordering a breeze.  I ordered the shumai, orange chicken and crab Rangoon. The website said 45 min...it took only 30 and she was really really nice.  The shumai was tiny...I was expecting a little bigger ..but they tasted fine.  The crab Rangoon was tasty...but the orange chicken...that was the bomb. Spicy...but not too much...just enough heat.   Well done."}
{"text":"Terrible food.  When this restaurant first opened the food was good but now it is terrible.  Even after saying we would never be back we tried it again and not only had a bad experience but also got deathly ill from the food.  We ordered the ribs and asked for them not to be burnt.  The top two of the four ribs were the way we asked for them to be but the other two ribs were not only burnt but we're half the size of the top two.  We complained and was told by the waiter that if we wanted different ribs we would need to pay for another order.  This is crazy.  How can they get away with selling inferior food.   The last time we ate there we ordered orange chicken.  It was so spicy we immediately told the waitress who then spoke to the owner.  The owner did nothing to make it right and made sure we paid for it even though we only had two pieces.   All this restaurant seems to care about is making money.  They do not care a thing about customer service.   Do not waste your money.  It's worth driving further for better food."}
{"text":"The worst Chinese food we've ever had. I ended up not eating any of it. $50 down the drain. We ordered two appetizers (crispy squid and shu mi). For dinner crispy duck, hot and spicy beef and the curry chicken   All terrible. I'm so sorry to have to say this. We've eaten Chinese food in many countries and in many states. This one is sadly awful. We will never go back. My husband says it's a zero. Save your money and go elsewhere or stay home and have a sandwich. Wish we had."}
{"text":"I don't mind paying for food, as long as it's worth it in quantity and taste; i was very disappointed. It is not worth it. I ordered duck and there was very little meat to it with white rice. They gave me a little sauce, which didn't taste good. I regret ordering there."}
{"text":"great chicken lo mein, I wasn't a fan of the fried wonton."}
{"text":"Customer service is great... my wife n I finally decided to stop by and I'm glad we did this place is great ...good food and great atmosphere 10 out of 10 deff coming back"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place out for my birthday dinner a few days ago. Being teenagers, the main thing we looked for besides the food, was the service, since at other restaurants, we were treated differently being at a somewhat young age. However, the owner's wife, our server as well, was very kind to us, and was even so generous enough to give us free Thai iced teas. Now food wise, I give it an 11/10, it was that good. We all got something from the noodles section and it was delicious, along with a few appetizers. Their service is great and their prices are a bit on the $$, but it's okay for the amount of food they give, which is something to come back for. Overall, our experience here so far was great and I'll be glad to recommend this place to my other friends and family."}
{"text":"This is an outstanding restaurant, We had the dumplings , duck spring rolls, & spicy crispy duck. Not one disappointment. Very complex flavors. Beautiful presentation. We will be back./"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a new thai/Asian place and stopped in here. Very expansive menu with very reasonable prices. Was the first cold day in Vegas off the fall, so tried a duck ramen dish that for like 8 bucks was worth twice that. Hot green tea for a drink and friendly conversation with the owner(s). Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Food is disgusting. I told my daughter not to go to this restaurant because the food is not only terrible but if you have an issue the owners don't care enough to make it right. Anyways she decided to try it and got very sick from the food. My family and friends will never be back. We need a better restaurant in this location."}
{"text":"2nd visit to this place since they opened. Had the same waitress, must say I am surprised she is still there. She needs training on how to speak with customers.  Management is not much better, no enthusiasm or appreciation for customers. Customary things like hello, how is everything, thank you for coming etc. Décor is awful, had to step over a banner laying in the middle of the floor to get to the restroom.  Find somewhere else, like Good China or Chang Lee. Food is mediocre here."}
{"text":"This was the worst I ever experienced.  The sweet and sour chicken had no sauce, was very dry.  The lo Mein noodles were drowning in sauce and were very soggy.  Save your money.   Panda express is better than this place."}
{"text":"I really can't add much to the already glowing reviews here except to say I will be back to explore more of their menu.  Compared to some places the portions could be bigger BUT the food is very high quality and they will happily alter any dish the way you prefer.  I started with the curry puffs. Delicious! The dipping sauce was good and the cucumber pieces had designs carved into the skin. Nice touch.  This was followed by a ginger dressed salad which tasted as if they'd made it themselves. I make my own ginger dressing and theirs was very good.  For my entree I had the Ginger Perfect [chicken] but also wanted the spicy basil. We settled on spicing up the ginger perfect and it was, in a word, perfect! I like spicy & delicious.  Washed it all down with a thai tea [no boba] and plenty water as it was hot and caffeine can dehydrate.  It was a perfect meal. They are very attentive and treat people as if they never meet a stranger. Genuinely warm folks serving good food. I can't wait to return, I'm making myself hungry just typing this!"}
{"text":"I only had take out but it was great.  It was ready when I arrived and they were very friendly. Made me feel at home.  I'll be back when I have some more time and try dining in. Also I found I can order online. So that's good to know."}
{"text":"We ordered a few appetizers to give them a try. We order the satay beef sticks and they gave us chicken instead. Very disappointed as it didn't even taste like satay at all. The shumai and crab rangoons were good as well, but I personally didn't like the pork dumplings. Quick delivery."}
{"text":"The food was really good but the service was exceptional.  I love family owned restaurants for that reason! They are very attentive to your needs.  My daughter has many allergies and they were able to navigate with me what she could have and couldn't have.  I have been to many restaurants and as soon as I tell them she has an allergy, I get the look , \"why are you eating out, eat at home?\" But at this restaurant I got the empathetic look and she made sure we were taken care of! They were all so friendly and checked up on us frequently.  My husband hates when our drinks are not filled and it was always filled.  This restaurant is also kid friendly.  They were very attentive to my kids and Uncle Peter even got my daughter to take more bites of her food :) You rarely get this kind of service any where and if they continue to do what they do, exceptional service and great food, they will definitely be successful in this business world! Thank you to Barbara, Uncle Peter and Momma Jean for everything tonight! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really great restaurant. The food is super! Great service and great prices. My favorite place so far for Chinese food in the area. Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on 7-12-2014 by chance after simply seeing the sign driving by.  Anything with the term fusion is typically a turn off to us as we are traditional.  So glad we stopped.  We ordered papaya salad that was to dye for...summer rolls were crisp and fresh...fish with curry sauce and the chefs special chicken.  Three side salads with house dressing came along.  With only two entrees, feed three of us and we were all licking our lips.  The ladies finished with fresh mango with sticky rice for desert.    Two major points.  1) This is truly a Mom and Pop's place which we really prefer...mainly for the cooking but also for rewarding hard working people.  2)  Thai food made without MSG and made perfectly to taste is HUGE.  Too often it is either full of additives or Americanized to the point of lost flavor.  Great service, very clean atmosphere, YUMMY food.  Great formula for return customers.  Highly recommend....see ya there!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. After an hour a very hot and sweaty young man was at my door. He had the wrong address and phone number on the delivery slip! When I ordered the man barely spoke English and I had to remind him that info three times! Yet he still got it wrong!!! Plus I order House fried rice and they sent me pork. The food was average. Nothing but gooy wontons in the soup and same with Hot and Sour soup. There is a place on Olive and 91st ave that is the best ever! Tons of everything in all their items and taste incredible. I'll stick with them in the future! Pretty sure this review will be deleted by Oriental House."}
{"text":"My girl and I one damn came in because it was down the street. there was an older gentleman who greeted us, and was there to our every need. But the customer service is great but i believe the food is so much better. I go there often, and try a new dish and i haven't been disappointed.  And there chicken is he best!"}
{"text":"I like this place and look forward to returning. Great service and the entrees are outstanding.  The portions are insane!!  I ordered the General Tso chicken.  I got like 2.5 - 3 times a normal portion and for a very low price.    Negatives are their beer selection is bud, colors, etc.  No Asian beers.  Also their fried rice and brown were below average.  I'll try their white rice next time.  Their outstanding entrees more than make up for those glitches."}
{"text":"YUM!! The service was super friendly that you forget your in Vegas!! The owner is always our server and he is GREAT!! He will change up your meal to add anything you want. Ask for the BBQ pork fried rice - it is not on the menu (fried rice is - just not the bbq pork)  but they will make it and its fantastic! I always get the asain noodles - its pad thai but better. Also you must try the ground chicken, to die for!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined in on a Sunday, late afternoon.  There were a number of people there, always a good sign.  The staff was very pleasant and eager to please.  Despite English not being their first language, communication was not a problem.  We  both enjoyed our meals - lemon chicken and teriyaki beef and shrimp, which were hot and delicious - and very plentiful!  The restaurant was clean and roomy.  We are so glad to have a good Chinese food restaurant of this caliber in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I was really happy with this place. We got the Pho and Ramen, and although not \"traditional\" tasting (my pho had some spices in there that I don't normally get at Viet Pho places), they were both *delicious*. And the Thai Iced Tea was the best I've ever had. Peter, the owner/waiter, was so friendly and nice. The restaurant was cozy and thoughtfully decorated. This is a hidden gem and we will definitely put this on our list of favorite places to eat near our house!"}
{"text":"This was the worst Chinese food I ever had. I ordered the shrimp fried rice and was only able to eat a fourth of it. The rice had very little flavor and the shrimp was small and had a weird taste."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The owners were the ones to serve us. Very attentive and excellent thai flavor.   Our new favorite thai spot is here!  We usually hit Archis or Le Thai but neither of those compare to this yummy gem.   Pricing was reasonable and the food was hot and fresh. Great service and great people. Love love love it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were going back and forth about the rating, I wanted to go lower but she said to give them the benefit.  We ordered our drinks and egg rolls and they were the in a flash! ...we were impressed!  It went down hill quickly from there....we tried to order but the waiter spoke very little English and he got someone else.  We were trying to order to our liking but it again was lost in translation....my wife and daughter ordered dinner for 2 having potstickers, egg drop soup, with orange chicken and chicken lo mein.  My wife said the lo mein tasted like seafood, the chichen was too heavily breaded and then to top it off none of the dinners came with rice!  It was extra! I ordered the sesame special chicken, although it too was heavily breaded I thought the taste was descent but again no rice!  The waiter was VERY attentive and friendly however so many other choices out there I don't think we will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff! I've been there about 3 times already. The food isn't too salty or oily. The place is clean and neat. From observing, I can tell that they really try and make sure their guests feel comfortable. Definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"overall experience at this restaurant was positive and they do many things well. They have taken over a building that was more of a homestyle restaurant so you can tell based upon the interior design. I would return and it seems decent for a Chinese restaurant in the West Valley.  it seems family owned and everyone was friendly. The Thai curry sauce was probably not a paste, more of a powder base so it wasn't as in-depth and flavorful but it was still OK. The fried rice did not have any vegetables in it so I probably would order regular white rice next time"}
{"text":"No so good food everything is too blend for me wish it was as good as somewhere  I eat before in Peoria but I guess I will take my business somewhere else and it was a Sunday and no one was there"}
{"text":"We've ordered delivery through 'Beyond Menu' twice now. First time having Oriental House we loved it. Garlic broccoli was spicy af and delicious, came with perfect white rice.  Veggie lo mein had great flavor.  This time it's like a completely different restaurant.  The garlic broccoli came with egg fried rice.. I can't eat eggs so that's now inedible.  The garlic broccoli was so bland, no flavor or spice and the lo mein was cold with zero flavor.  We will not risk a bad experience and try again so sadly that's it for us and Oriental House."}
{"text":"In 1 word, sucked. Ordered Mongolian beef.. that's safe, right? Every Chinese food place on the face of the Earth can do Mongolian Beef.... Nope. The beef tasted freezer burnt, and was not cooked done.. need was chewy.. like undercooked chewy.. ordered with fried rice.. double nope... Dunno what it was, I can only describe the taste as \"dusty\".. like they found a bag of rice in a dark corner that they had forgotten about and decided to use it.. told the server, she said sorry and charged the full amount. Explained that that had a new chef.. sorry... Yep, me too.. but I won't be sorry again..."}
{"text":"So disappointed took 1 and 1/2 hours to get food beef Lo mein was horrible pork fried rice looked like white rice with very little pork in and crab puffs were cold! I called after 1 hour and she said he will be in a few minutes  took them another 30 minutes only live 10 minutes from the store! I did get it for free but wish I had just ordered pizza!"}
{"text":"Really good food! The orange chicken is really really spicy but flavorful. Beef and broccoli and sesame chicken are awesome. The only thing is that the dinners only come with rice, but the portions are very generous. Love this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food and wonderful service!! Luv everything I ordered and mango chicken was the bomb!!! Will be back Luv luv luv thank you for making my day!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great service by the owner who made suggestions and was so sweet.  Even brought me a complimentary Thai Ice Tea! I ordered the steamed dumplings similar to a shu-Mai . I got the chicken with Basil and added brocolli and it was the best sauce and made with white meat chicken, no mystery meat! I ate the whole plate. Simply great food great service with a heart! Let keep this family business in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My first visit here last week was very very good. The girl that waited on us was so pleasant and helpful and took great care of us. I came back again today with another friend and the guy that waited on us could not understand our orders. He was really struggling. We did not get our drinks and had to ask twice. later for refills . He went to go and take our cups and we reach quickly and grabbed our straws and he forgot to bring back the refills. We had to ask twice for our soup , Then later I got one egg roll, and then I got my meal and my friend was brought something she didn't order. it was a wait to get her food. The food was good,  but care is needed in choosing your wait staff. Comparing the first visit to the second visit was night and day. I was excited to have this restaurant so close to our home, but I'm not sure I will return again soon."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING WAS TASTELESS. Their food sucks. Don't waste your money. We just moved here from Chicago and chose this Chinese cause it was close to where we live. We ordered 50$ of food all different kinds of meat, noodles and rice and it was all gross. Kung Pao chicken wasn't even spicy. Fried rice was over cooked and tasteless (howcan you go wrong with fried rice). Noodles were colorless. Sesame chicken was soggy. Gross. Never again. Save your money."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service! I had the Asian connection from the house favorites. It was spicy and delicious. Very friendly staff and nice decor inside."}
{"text":"Oriental House has the best Chinese food with a 5 mile radius.  Egg rolls are large, not heavy with oil.  Kung Pao Chicken was the best I've had in my life, & I've been around.  Egg drop soup is not salty like most Chinese restaurants.  Good size portions & they offer a 10% Senior Discount just for the asking.  Alex, our waiter, is very pleasant, has a good sense of humor, & he'll make sure you are satisfied with the taste of the food.  I do not recommend the Sweet & Sour Pork.  We are not that hot about eating deep fried foods, but, we thought we'd try this one.  Pork was dried & chewy probably from it being cooked twice.  Sent it back without a problem.  Maybe they'll change the way it's prepared. Who knows. The owners have a successful restaurant in Yuma, \"Yuma Palace\", so, they are not beginners like the last two previous tenants in this building.  I hope they can sustain for longer than 2 years by winning over patrons from some of the other nearby Asian food restaurants.  they're cleaned up the inside &  outside.  I wish them much luck & happiness in their new venture.  give them a try!!  (No, I'm not related to them.  I'm Euro-American.)"}
{"text":"The food was awesome! The only complaint I have was how long it took us to get our food. I could see a whole counter full of take out getting bigger but our food took a good 30mins and came out 2 meals at a time (for a 9 person group that was weird). I saying that I do realize that it was Mother's Day and they were busy."}
{"text":"Very nice ambience and interior.  The people that work here are very helpful.  Your drink is always refilled.  Summer rolls are good,  chicken wings have great flavor.  Pad thai and pho are Delish!"}
{"text":"The outside of the building is awesome looking. Might be an old Denny's but they redecorated nicely. The inside is very clean. The servers are nice and courteous. The hot and sour soup is some of the best I've ever had. I ordered the orange chicken extra spicy. It was the perfect amount of spice. Overall the best Chinese I've had in the west valley. Don't mind bad service reviews these guys just opened a week or so ago."}
{"text":"All 3 things I got were horrible. Mango sticky rice had nasty white goop for sauce instead of coconut milk, and the rice was not prepared properly. Basil eggplant chicken was way oily and bland. Basil beef fried rice was cheap on beef, vegetables, and basil. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Restaurant is in a run down strip mall, but once you are inside it is nice.  Me and my date were seated very fast.  Silverware was never brought to my date.  I tried to ask the waitress, but she was so busy.  It looked like she was the server for the whole restaurant.  I just grabbed silverware from an empty table.  I ordered the BBQ spare rib appetizer.  The appetizer came after our meals.  I ordered the house lo main.  It was very greasy but not bad.  My date had the Sesame chicken, it was very good.  Also the fried chips or won tons they bring to the table are great.  The reason for the two star is ad we ask for the check, that is when we are told cash only.  She said there debit machine was down.  Thank god I had cash, I rarely keep cash.  That should of been told to us at the door.  I won't return unless I have cash.  It us not bad food, but I would not go when busy service is just not good enough."}
{"text":"The service by Peter, the owner, was excellent. We were greeted and served promptly.This place is pretty good, but very under-advertised. The menu is extensive, but if you are in for flavorful and succulent Thai and Chinese food, then this is your place.  We had the steamed mussels as an appetizer, and they had just enough seafood flavor with the ginger and herbs in the clay pot, we did not need the dipping sauce. I ordered the Spicy crispy duck with minimal spice and it was so good and fresh. The portions were just right and the prices were affordable. My daughter ordered the wont ton soup, twice. I tried the simple broth and the flavor wasn't overpowering or bland, but just right. My husband ordered the ginger seafood medley, it was cooked to be savory and delicious. Even the thai Iced tea was very good and not too sweet. To be honest, this place is similar to Lotus of Siam, but with affordable prices. Just sayin'....   The service by Peter, the owner, was excellent. We were greeted and served promptly."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese I think I've ever had. I love Chinese and have been to alot of different places. This place was horrible and didn't think you could mess Chinese food up like this. The orange chicken and sesame chicken we're absolutely horrible and tasted nothing like what they taste everywhere else. The Kungpoa chicken was disgusting and absolutely no flavor at all. I don't know if they cater to sun City and are scared to ad flavor but they are doing a good job at leaving it out. The rice was way over cooked and mushy. I know I sound like a complainer but I'm not picky at all but this place was just horrible.  E&J and big heng are alot  better if you want Chinese close by."}
{"text":"This place does have a weird mixture of food. Between the two times I have come here I have had thai beef salad, pho, atlantic noodles, eggplant tofu, ragoons, thai tea, and mango sticky rice. It was all decent, but nothing that blew me away. The ragoons could use more filling. My favorite was probably the atlantic noodles (if you like seafood) and I do love the mango sticky rice.   It would have a decent atmosphere except every time I go it is a ghost town, as in completely empty except for me and my boyfriend. It is a little awkward to eat in an empty restaurant, but hey at least it is quite.   I will probably be back again. The owner is pretty accommodating, he really wants to make his customers happy. We got free house salads last time which was awesome because the dressing they use is really unique. I liked them a lot. Their menu is huge so it is really just a matter of finding your favorite thing."}
{"text":"Read about this new Asian restaurant and had to give it a try. Server was quick and friendly, making sure we were comfortable and if we had any questions. Our two orders (chow mein and vegetables w/pork with several special requests came prepared as requested and delicious. Everything tasted like it was entirely freshly prepared. Spring rolls were the best we've ever had. We'll be back real soon to Oriental House. Sincerely, Karen & Art Huseonica, Sun City, AZ"}
{"text":"Just came back from trying Oriental House and BOY am I happy we finally got to this one on my Yelp list. There was no one in the place but I remained steadfast in believing my fellow YELPers. It's a mom and pops and they are soooo cute! Place was spotless! Decor was adorable. Saw the cook washing her hands several times-very assuring in this time of \"too many to count closures\" in Chinatown and Asian restaurants in general. Food was fresh and the choices were amazing! I recommend stopping in and if it's empty-the service will be just that much better! Happy to say 4 more tables came in and all seemed to be enjoying it as much as we did."}
{"text":"Orange chicken was soggy & tasteless.   Chow mein was total waste. Horrible & nasty taste.   $50+ dollar mistake that will never ever happen again."}
{"text":"We ordered the sesame chicken, general tso's chicken & egg drop soup. It was all very \"meh\". We did get it to go & by the time we got it home the food was incredibly soggy. The soup was pretty good though. If we try it again we will try dining in. Heads up, I'm pretty sure they use MSG."}
{"text":"The food was so delicious! The service is super friendly and amazing. You feel so welcomed. I really like it there."}
{"text":"FYI oriental house is closed right now. Says  under new management. So sad! If Oriental House relocates let me know. Loved Peter's food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend came here with her mom, and thought it was so good that she had to bring me. I'm here to say that I'm glad she did! Though we were the only two in the restaurant, the service did not suffer. They were very attentive, and friendly as well! I had the Cashew Nut Chicken and my girlfriend had the Asian Noodles. Both came out in great time and were very tasty! The way their spice orders work, mild medium and spicy, are quite accurate. I had mine medium and it was just as I expected! I highly recommend coming here either for a great lunch it dinner."}
{"text":"As much as I don't like to have order from menu at Chinese restaurant, I just loved this place! Nice decor , very fancy place ! Food was delishhhhh!!! Can't believe some Yelpers wrote negative review, they might did not know difference of bad places and bad food!!! I will be back !!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! When my fiancé and I couldn't decide on where to eat dinner last night, we decided to try this place out... And I'm so glad we did!! We ordered takeout and I had the asian noodles with tofu (pad thai) while my fiancé had the garlic and black pepper beef. Both were delicious, fresh, and full of flavor! The asian noodles had the perfect amount of spice to it and wasn't oily (compared to other restaurants) and the sauce from the garlic and black pepper beef was amazing! Oh and service was excellent, even for takeout! The woman at the register was very kind and really knows how to make you feel welcome. I find that most asian restaurants lack in service, but definitely not this place! I can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite!  Peter is the sweetest.  We had a variety of dishes last night including red coconut curry, Singapore noodles, summer rolls, and salad. Everything was perfect!  The atmosphere in the restaurant is lovely.  It's a big menu so there's something for everyone to enjoy.  Tip: if you like spicy (I usually like medium), order it a bit less spicy than usual just in case.   This is going to be our new hangout. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's all a matter of opinion. Great service and good food. The owner knows how to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Delivery is FAST. Food is fresh and delicious. Their fried food is not greasy. I love their sauces. I get the chicken curry and the chicken satay a lot for lunch. They have a wide variety of choices and they are very accommodating with modifications. I highly recommend them! And you can order online or through an app, sooooo convenient :)"}
{"text":"Six of us came here for Christmas day lunch and had a wonderful time. The waitress was friendly and helpful, the restaurant was nicely decorated and the food was much better than I would have expected in a West Valley Chinese restaurant, where I suspect most customers prefer their Chinese food to be bland and sweet.   The hot and sour soup was excellent - filled with lots of fresh vegetables. My husband said the Kung Pao Chicken was good (not great) but I got a Thai Curry that actually had some heat to it - nicely prepared and I practically licked the platter clean. Our friends all said they enjoyed their meals very much and we all said we planned to visit this restaurant again.   I have to wonder about the customer who said the food was disgusting. Every plate I saw coming from the kitchen looked inviting, and the other customers seemed to be enjoying their food as much as we were."}
{"text":"Oriental House is great! As you walk in there is hand wash to cleanse your hands. I like this idea!! We were greeted and seated very quickly. It's a lovely place; very pretty. The wait staff is very friendly. Most of the lunch specials are in the $6 to $7 range; lots to choose from. I got the Sesame Chicken with Fried Rice. Yummy!"}
{"text":"While a little off the beaten path it was worth finding. Service was friendly and with a smile. Egg drop soup and crispy sesame chicken were tasty. I'll come back again."}
{"text":"The food is great and there's lots of it but the services sucks,tonight are server spoke little or No English so it was real hard getting things that we needed my granddaughter ordered a Sprint for her drink and a Pepsi came out boy can we say wrong thing . Has No idea how to serve food to a person kept reaching across in front of a person They All need to learn how to sever a person the right way hate to say I my not be back for a New place you may went to real think your choice Sorry"}
{"text":"Service was horrible and despicable! Egg drop soup was cold so gross! Asked the tall waiter with   The glasses if we could have more rice he argued with me about it! It was a ice cream scoop of rice for barely 1 person asked to give us more rice because there was 2 of us eating didn't even ask if we wanted brown rice"}
{"text":"A nice family owned and operated restaurant. I ordered the Green Curry. It was good, but not the best I've had here in town. It's a little on the pricey side as well.   I did enjoy the customer service though. The owner struck up a friendship with me and offered for me to visit him when he retires and goes back home   I'd usually give 3 stars for the food, but adding an extra star because I like the people"}
{"text":"Too much on the menu to be good. The food was bland. A shame as they are located close by. Server was so friendly!"}
{"text":"The menu at Oriental House is overwhelming with plenty of Chinese, Thai, and Japanese options. They would benefit from a more streamlined selection of dishes to focus on what they do best. What that is, I don't know. The satay chicken ($7.95) was a good portion for the price with about five skewers. The Kowloon noodles ($9.95) were decent. While light on chicken, the flat noodles with broccoli and bean sprouts in a black sauce were decent but seemed to be flavored for the more mild palate of western taste buds.  2.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Last Chinese place(Wong jr) I ordered from was meh, saw this place delivered so I gave it a shot. Use online service and ordered Mongolian beef w/ rice, crab puffs, and it required a $15 minimum so I added a drink. Total being around $20 plus tip. Placed the online order around 12:36pm, food arrived at 1:48pm--an hour wait. Idk if them putting my drink inside the same bag with my food was the reason or what, but doesn't matter.   The foods not worth it, especially with the quality of food--The crab ragoon$4.55 were more wonton than anything, and the Mongolian beef$9.95 had an excess of oil around it with chucky cut onions, and tastes okay \"meh\", Panda Express has more flavor and costs less.   Overall my experience in a nut shell...Long wait, and foods not worth time or money."}
{"text":"1st time here. My family and I decided to try this place since Chinese around our town is scarce. We had a guy waiter that had no idea what he was doing, He does not know English and got half of our order wrong. We then had a woman waiter which was very delightful, We had the kungpao chicken which literally had 4 pcs of chicken and about a pound of diced celery (very nice dish minus all the celery) we were supposed to get mango chicken however the guy ordered us shrimp. We had a thai dish and very little rice about 3 oz, Which was a little watery and mushy. Overall the taste was good they could improve on their rice consistency and the amount served they need to retrain the staff. The prices are a little high compared to other chinise places. We will try back in a few weeks."}
{"text":"So me and the wifey were craving Thai so we gave this new place a shot. What a waste the food sucked we had the basil/beef fried rice. Damn they wee cheap on the vegetables and the beef! The dish was mostly rice! Also had the mango sticky rice that thing looked like soup the rice was salty had to dump the sauce out. The only good thing was the mango. We had take out otherwise I would have returned everything!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here twice and highly recommend the food! The food is amazing, very ethic and fulfilling. The thai food is delicious and one of the best on this side of town. Besides the food, I must rave about the outstanding service from the owner himself and the immaculate presentation of the restaurant. We will make this place our bi-weekly eatery."}
{"text":"Went for lunch special and was very impressed. Server was very pleasant and courteous. Food was very good, large portions, and served very quickly.  Decor is fun! Full bar. Very clean."}
{"text":"This place is a hit and miss for me. I've been there twice with the family. The dinner for two for $18.95 is a very good deal and feeds at least 2 adults and two kids. My kids loved the orange chicken (we ordered it not spicy) and the beef and vegetables were delicious. I previous had the lo mein noodles which lacked flavor and I didn't care for the soups."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. We tried the egg rolls, orange chicken, shrimp lo mein, and shrimp egg foo young."}
{"text":"This place is great! The people are genuine and super nice! The food is even better. Oriental house has become a regular for us now , especially since there is an equally amazing boba tea place right next door!"}
{"text":"A little more on the expensive side but I have zero complaints about the food. Everything was delicious and served in huge portions. I was also delighted to find out they deliver. While I haven't been there in person yet, I will be making orders from here in the future"}
{"text":"Good food. Excellent service! Feels like a mom and pop shop. My only critique is that some of the dishes were overpriced."}
{"text":"Service.....excellent Food.....excellent.  What more can you ask for. High quality fresh ingredients made to order. No funny looking chicken parts here. Support local and eat here."}
{"text":"I had our meal delivered.  They deliver within 5 miles of their restaurant, for only $2.  I ordered sesame chicken, which was delicious.  The sauce was a sweet, thicker, brown sauce.  The steamed white rice my kids loved. Also ordered the veggie fried rice, and that too was yummy with a buttery flavor.  The veggie lo mein was very tasty, the noodles were thick but light and soft in texture plus they had a. Yummy buttery flavor.  Finally we ordered veggie egg foo yung, it was fantastic, but the sauce served with it was unbelievably amazing!  Overall this was an excellent delivery meal."}
{"text":"This will be a two part and two rating review.  First, aside from the food, I have to say that the service was very friendly. The server  attended us well, and made several suggestions, and as Audrey S. said, the owner makes you feel welcome. That was very positive.  Now a review of what we go out for, the food.  We decided to start out with a Spring Roll appetizer. The server recommended the Fresh Asian Roll instead. It was a good idea. It is nothing like the quality Spring Rolls you get at Pho So 1, or Pho Saigon 8, but it was light and refreshing.   I am on a diet, so I ordered a Chicken Salad. The menu said it was fried chicken. I asked the server if I could have it grilled. She accomodated me. It was very fresh, and light for a summer meal, but it really wasn't very Asian. It was simply a Thin cut chicken breast, on top of a bed of Ice Berg Lettuce, with cucumbers and tomatoes on the side. Not much presentation. Fresh and good for a diet, but not what I expected from a Thai Chinese place. I did give it 3 stars.  My wife ordered the Wanton and Noodle Soup. The bowl was small, and only a few Wanton. There was a ton of noodles, but she said they were over cooked, and she didn't even finish half of the portion. Rating 1 star.  Two stars means \"I've experienced better\", and this holds true for this place. If you are on a diet, go here for a clean salad. It's pricey for a small portion, but you'll feel better doing this, than pigging out at Sweet Tomatoes.   However, if you're looking for good Thai or Chinese food, do your sense of eating adventure a favor, and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time ordering to-go and very satisfied. Clean restaurant and friendly staff. A bit expensive but food taste really good and you get a lot of food. Give them a try. Will definately will go again."}
{"text":"The decor is so cute! It is definitely a very clean place from the front of house to the bathroom. The food is standard for a little Chinese place. Nothing above or below average, enjoyable definitely. The server we had was new and very sweet. She didn't speak perfect English, so she tried very hard to make sure we understood what she was saying. She kept our waters full and gave us unlimited rice refills. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious.   For appetizers ordered the spring rolls and the crab Rangoon. Both were great.  Entries were the Hawaiian fried rice, the Japanese curry, the vegetable curry, and ginger chicken.  Everyone loved their order.   The Thai tea was well prepared.  One recommendation for desert: try the mango and sticky rice.  This is a hidden gem.  Enjoy while few people know about it.  Warning: They are closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"My first order ever, was for delivery on a Sunday afternoon.  I didn't have a menu, so I just ordered personal favorites -  Hot and sour soup, spring rolls, and general Tso's chicken with white rice.  The delivery was super fast!  Everything I ordered arrived including the menu I had requested. The hot and sour soup is one of my all-time favorites, and believe me lots of Chinese restaurants don't do it very well. Oriental House has an excellent hot and sour soup - I highly recommend it. And even the crispy noodles came with the soup at no extra charge.  The spring rolls were fine but not my absolute favorite.  General Tso's chicken was nice and crispy with a slightly spicy sweet sauce that was quite tasty.  Even the white steamed rice tasted exceptionally good. The portions are quite large and I have enough leftover food for at least two more meals.  This is definitely the best Chinese food I have found in the Sun City area, since moving here four years ago. I will be a regular customer and recommend them to friends and neighbors.   I'm looking forward to visiting the restaurant and trying out some of their lunch specials, which are priced quite nicely."}
{"text":"Experience:  I came with some friends to try this place. It has both Chinese and Thai food. The menu is huge, so it's difficult to choose.   Food:  we had about 10 people, so I was able to taste many things on the menu.  I did but taste one dish I did not like.  Everything was very good.  I ordered the duck eggrolls which were very tasty.  Then I had the pork fried rice made spicy.  I asked for an 8 out of 10 on the hot scale and it was perfect for me.    Service: The waiter was super friendly and good at playful banter. He was very attentive and made suggestions where needed.   Facility: pretty small, but perfect for this casual establishment. It was pretty empty, but that just meant great service for us.   Overall review: I would come back here. The service and food were good."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing. We have been looking for a decent Chinese restaurant for a long time. This isn't it, we are still looking. Orange Chicken was so overcooked it was hard like a rock. Sweet and sour chicken was soggy in places bland. It had pineapple chunks with absolutely no flavor at all. How do you kill pineapple? Ordered beef fried rice. I dumped the container on a plate trying to find the beef. Where's the beef? My girls who love fried rice would not eat it. There were a couple things that were ok. Egg rolls were ok. Crab Rangoon was ok. Everything else, not so much. Tried it, didn't like it, back to the search for a decent Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"I've never had a pork dish that was as tender as the one I had here (garlic and black pepper pork).  Awesome service, amazing food, a stone's throw away from my house.. What more can I ask for? I hope this place stays open for a very long time."}
{"text":"I decided to give the Oriental House a try because it's close to my house and am i glad i did. WHAT NICE FRIENDLY PEOPLE!! upon entering we were immediately greeted by one of the owners Barbara. She runs it with her husband Max and \"Momma Jean\" is the main chef. Oriental House just opened a few weeks ago however, these owners are NOT new to the restaurant world. They owned many famous eateries over 30 years including \"Pata\" on Wilshire in Beverly Hills and \"Chitra\".      When you walk in, the ambiance is very spacious and modern. i like the decor all around the room. the restaurant is very clean and the customer service is A-1.  Now lets talk about the menu. Easily over ONE HUNDRED items to choose from!!   Everything from Lemon Grass Chicken to Chaba noodle soup, Shanghai clay pot, Indian curry soup, Hawaiian fried rice, Japanese creamy curry, LOTS of Vegetarian choices and deserts included Fried bananas or Mango with sticky rice. I can't wait to try them all!  Side note: They do not sell alcohol (yet). But will introduce beer and wine on the menu soon!  Do yourself a favor and visit The Oriental House."}
{"text":"My husband been wanting to try this place & I'm super glad we did!! They deliver great customer service.  Our server was Peter, turns out to be owner. We had great conversations from where his restaurant first started and owns at other places.    Food - omg.. food presentation is gourmet and the food is very delish! You can taste the authentic spices and ingredients. Also, very fresh!!!!  Peter also gave me the courtesy to try the curry bowl w rice and complimentary house Salad for my husband and I. Also, made our little one try ice cream.  I recommend this place with a 5 star!! Definitely will be coming back.   They deliver thee best food and creates clientele relationships & I love it!!!"}
{"text":"I liked it.  This was more the east coast influenced that I'm used to, so they get 5 stars in my book.  Friendly staff didn't mind all of my questions and they were very attentive.  Prices were good for the amount of food provided.  Will go back again because I want to try the Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Food is very tasty, very focused on flavor, not one sauce for all. I can taste on each flavors. Support local new business. Clean, friendly, and welcome environment. The correction of number is 702-550-4262."}
{"text":"I could eat here daily. Ordered take out and it came quick fresh and HOT!!! I had Hot and Sour soup AMAZING the salt and pepper Calamari small order wish I would have ordered a large, it was the best I have had in 20 years!!! I love the shredded pork but next time I will try something new. This will be a weekly dinner stop for sure"}
{"text":"This place is great. We loved it. The food was excellent and Peter and Jean were so wonderful."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Great home style Thai/Chinese.   And did I say they have amazing service??   Yummy food too"}
{"text":"Fantastic General Tsos chicken. I crave this stuff.  Oriental House serves a very large yummy portion. I can usually get 2-3 meals from one entree. The lemon chicken is good, too, just a bit different than I expected. White meat chicken breast breaded in panko breading with a separate lemon sauce that you can pour over. My favorite is by far their crab rangoon. Fried to order...fresh and delicious. $5 for 10 pieces."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, service excellent. Peter is very friendly and made suggestions as it was our first time. We will be back very soon!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you Oriental House for a great lunch! I called an order for carry out. Hot and sour soup and egg drop soup was very good. Just enough heat for hot and sour and egg drop was very pleasant. Not bland and corn starchy. Vegetable fried rice was excellent. Pieces of pea pods, mushroom, zucchini , broccoli , onion, water chestnuts, not made with frozen vegetables . Singapore noodles were awesome! It had a tad too much fish sauce, but the curry and noodles were spot on! Pork, Shrimp, chicken delish. We will be ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Last time we visited it seemed that the waitress was new.  She was sweet and managed to get through serving our small group.   Today the waitress seemed a little lost and there seemed to be a bit of a language barrier but again it all worked out and the meals were delicious."}
{"text":"THE HYPE IS REAL !!!!!!' amazing food, and the sweetest most genuine people ... See Peter, great guy , I was treated like a king..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant, and I am glad me and my friends decided to give this place a chance because it was delicious. I had the spicy linguini, and if you like spicy food this place will hook it up. Also the owners were so nice and friendly! The gave us some salads on the house and were just very courteous. My beverage was never empty. All my friends really enjoyed their meals and the price was extremely decent. We ended the meal with some delicious fried ice cream. Definitely recommend this place! :-)"}
{"text":"They make their own sauce so you can get sugar free.  If you like spice order Thai hot ;). Ginger perfect is always a favorite.  Trying Spicy Ground Chicken toady.  Smells wonderful!"}
{"text":"Eaten here twice and both times the food was great and the service was excellent...I'll be coming back again and again trying different things on the menu...not too expensive and definitely worth it to come check this place out..."}
{"text":"I ordered 40 dollars in food and got nothing. After two hours of waiting and multiple calls of not being able to find my house and lies about being given the wrong address i cancelled my order. I've never had such a hard time with delivery in my life. I can't say anything about the food itself and I never will as they have lost me as a customer the first time out. I highly recommend dining in because their drivers won't find you."}
{"text":"We tried for first time tonight. Great food and service we tried several different menu items and all were fresh and tasted delicious. We will for sure go back and everyone must try highly recommended"}
{"text":"I have been craving pad Thai lately and trying different spots in my area. This one so far has been my favorite. The Asian noodle as the call it, is pad Thai and so delicious. The spice level and amount of sauce is right where it should be. I have been twice in a week which is a testimony to the delicious noodles they have. They have a very large menu and the restaurant is always quiet. I am sad that this restaurant is empty when I come because it deserves recognition! The owners are here and the wait staff is very friendly! She gave me two 10% off cards to use on my next visits. Come here if you want a large selection of all delicious Asian food."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time last night and were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food and service. The spicy crispy duck was like nothing we'd ever tasted before, and so was the seafood in clear noodles.  Coming back with some friends soon, and I'm even thinking of celebrating my birthday here!"}
{"text":"I have had two deliveries from here.  The food was excellent - good flavor, hot and in durable containers.  So, we decided to go in.  The first time the food was as good and the service was nice.  Yesterday will be the last time we go in there.  Our server was quite friendly, but anything we asked her for did not arrive.  When we went to pay, the woman behind the counter was on the phone, did not hang up, continued her phone conversation and never said one word to us.  I will never subject myself to that kind of subhuman treatment ever again.  Will I ever get delivery again?  Probably not - I choose to spend my money supporting businesses doing good things with excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Best Singapore noodles ever, liked the egg fried rice A LOT as well.  Inside is decorated with nice lighting, unlike most Chinese places I'll only pick up from! Very fast when I do order take out, my food was done in 6 minuets."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Chinese/Thai restaurant! I skipped the regular items found in all other restaurants and chose the Mango Chicken dish, and it was superb! We also tried the Singapore Noodles... WOW! And the service was excellent!   You won't be disappointed! Give them a try you will be back!"}
