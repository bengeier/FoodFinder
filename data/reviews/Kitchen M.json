{"text":"Came here for afternoon tea.  Reasonably price and food selection.  Spacious inside, getting into parking lot can be a challenge because of markville mall traffic.  I would come back again."}
{"text":"Nice decor, place is huge so lots of seating. Most rice come with soup and drink combo."}
{"text":"Service and food is way better than Phoenix. Food is delicious! Their food is between Congee Queen and Phoenix. The bbq duck is the best! Bonus- free wifi!!"}
{"text":"I don't expect good service from most Chinese establishments but the staff are fast, friendly and wonderful here! Wide variety of options on the menu."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday night. There were mutiple menus to look at making it difficult to choose something somewhat. However, also a good thing being that there were many different assortment of options to choose from. I ordered the Black pepper chicken with spaghetti for 9.95. The chicken came out perfectly hot and crispy, and quite juicy. The sauce was really peppery, which I like. I like the fact that almosy every dish comes with soup and a drink. Comparably, the prices are fairly good and I find the food alot better than Hollywood. I would definitely comw again to try other things."}
{"text":"This location has probably been the most unsuccessful locations for any restaurants. It has change so many times I probably haven't been to half of what it were. But now that it's a HK style cafe, and seems to have quite the business, I thought I would give it a try.   To be honest it is pretty average for a HK style cafe. Very typical food offered but they do have things that are really random. They offer the typical HK style breakfasts like macaroni, toast, instant noodles, etc. They also have congee and rice dishes, even poutine! (Some of the cheese curds were kinda rubbery but it's not bad)   Price-wise it was decent, nothing out of the ordinary pricing for these kinds of food. They have a lot of space and a lot of staff so there always a seat and quick service. There is also free newspaper for customers to take home!"}
{"text":"First time here for dinner with family of ten, it is a big place that i can bring my baby stroller in.  There have 36 dishes to choose from for $8.25+.  The portion of the dish surprisingly large that still can pack up."}
{"text":"Decent food with good variety. Food portions were good. HK milk tea tastes better than ice tea."}
{"text":"This is my third time going there and will be my last time.  We have 3 people and I don't know why they only give us one pair of chopsticks. OK,fine I ask 2 pair of chopsticks. I have no idea what did the waitress said when she is turning her back..Fine.  We order 3 dishes and ask the waitress how is the taste of one of the dish like.she explain to us and said the dish is popular.   We order it but she want the code number of the dishes.  OK I told her the no.  When one of the dish come,I said this is not the one I order.  She said you give me the wrong number.  I said you tell me the dish is good ,how could you get it wrong.  Her attitude is so bad and shout out that is my fault right in front of other customer.   I am really mad and OK,now I decided not going there anymore.   I think this restaurant won't last long."}
{"text":"Very large and food, staff are very good. It all depends on what you order and what you like in order to have a delicious time here. I personally like the new mixed grill hot pot, it comes sizzling hot while they pour the sauce on! Very filling for a good price.  Great for large family dinners especially with children. A large comfortable place, definitely started off rocky but it's steady and will reach new heights in the future! Will come again :)"}
{"text":"Braised beef noodle failed as they use instant udon noodles, hate the after taste. 2 stars.   Also had sirloin steak spaghetti, steak is marinated Hk style so it doesn't quite taste like beef anymore, but ok it's tasty. 3.5 stars.   Grouper spaghetti... It's ok. 3.5 stars.   Milk tea is actually quite decent."}
{"text":"If I could give it a negative, I would. This place was an absolute mistake; got there around 7:15 and didn't leave till 8:45. This is not because the food was soooo amazing that I had to stay, but rather that my kids had to wait 45 minutes for the wonton with instant noodles. Yes folks, that's right, I said \"Instant.\" Not so instant in my opinion. We've all made instant noodles at some point in our lives; never has it taken me even more than 20 minutes and that's usually because I'm adding beef balls, eggs, or spam. Maybe they had to run out to the supermarket to buy it. In any case, I ordered a Portuguese Beef Brisket Rice, which came in 20 minutes. The plate was enormous but the amount of food didn't quite exactly fit the size of the plate as my kids managed to scarf down most of it before their noodles arrived. My dish was below average as the brisket was very tough and the sauce tasted like it came out of a Lee Kum Kee bottle, but my kids were super hungry, so they ate it anyways. Had to ask for water three times as my kids can't drink tea, but after three failed attempts, I didn't bother. I also noticed several individuals leave before they finished my meal which was an indication that the food was not very good. I also noticed that the table in front of us was informed that they ran out of whatever she ordered, but this was 25 minutes after she ordered. Needless to say, she got up and left. When I was about to leave, I asked to pay with Interac but they said it wasn't set up. They should really take off that Interac sign on the front door if they don't offer that form of payment. So, I had to run out to the bank and get cash; pretty much adding salt to the wound. I guess you pretty much see that this will be my first and last visit. One of my worst dining experiences EVER. If you're smart, stay FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Hk style milk tea! \"Authentic\" Hk style food! Big restaurant with lots of booth seats."}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ pork with rice, half of the meat were full of tendon that I can't even eat it. When I told the Waitress, she said Cantonese people like BBQ pork with tendon (I spoke Mandarin to her).  In my head I was thinking what are you talking about, but I didn't argue with her and just decided not to come back."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food...pretty standard HK cafe fare.  Extra star because I value good service, and, for an Asian place, they definitely went above and beyond to merit that.  Plus, I have yet to come across a place that serves tofu fa as dessert...so that was a pleasant surprise!  Ordered some standard stuff: a pork chop rice and some beef spaghetti dish.  Nothing special re the pork chop rice.  Same goes for the spaghetti.  Only thing is, either the wait staff or the kitchen messed up the meat on the spaghetti (i.e. they put fish instead of beef), and we sent it back.  They were SO GOOD about fixing the dish to the correct order.  The HK milk tea and lemon tea that we ordered were ok.  We'll come back again and try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, had curry chicken on rice nothing too special. Terrible service, waiters miss one of our orders. Had to ask twice on our order. Wont come back..."}
{"text":"First impression was confusing with the number of menus we have to read before ordering. Once we passed the first hurdle, everything we ordered was tasty. The staff are all very friendly, they gave you decent food for relatively good price. All our meals came with soup and a small dessert. We have gone back to Kitchen M 3 times for quick meals and all have been good. Our favorite is the chicken steak with spaghetti with garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Their sweet and sour pork was very succulent and tasty. Probably the most delicious sweet and sour pork I've ever tasted. Once I've tasted this dish I never bother ordering it from other places.  The dishes I've ever ordered from the restaurant always come in a large portion. Tasted pretty good too. Except for one time when I ordered stir fried vegetables with mushroom it was lacking in flavour as it was too watery, as if the sauce was watered down. But nonetheless I'd go back again to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Located in an old plaza across from Markville Mall, Kitchen M takes this notoriously oft-changing restaurant spot. I don't know whether it's the fact that this location doesn't get a lot of traffic because it's rather disconnected from anything else you might want to drop by for (the only other storefronts in this plaza are basically a Baskin Robbins & a private driving school) or because this place is somehow just cursed, but restaurants don't seem to stay in this spot for any longer than a year or two.   Kitchen M serves a mishmash of dim sum, Cantonese a la carte dishes, and some HK-style cafe items.  The food's OK.  Some of the dim sum dishes are quite large, so you get some bang for your buck.  The one standout item for me would be the deep fried milk egg custard buns. Otherwise, in perfect honesty I feel that everything else is take it or leave it.  Will Kitchen M succumb to the 1-2 year curse?"}
{"text":"This place has the best breakfast special I come here every weekend morning that I can!! It runs from 9-11am on Fridays to Sundays (9:30-11:30 Mon-Thurs) and you can match 2 items on their breakfast combo menu + drink for $5.95. The portions are a great size and you leave feeling full!   The service is super fast. We ordered and received our meals in 10 mins. I got the two eggs and sausage with butter toast with the ham macaroni and everything was delicious. A very clean breakfast since nothing was too oily or fried and still super flavourful. We arrived pretty early at 9:30 so there was no wait at all but I've been here before around 10:30 and it could get crowded from all the people trying to make that 11am breakfast special cut-off.  What's a plus as well is that they give complementary Chinese newspapers that you can take with you for someone who reads them (if you don't yourself)."}
{"text":"Kitchen M is a huge unit and there's never any wait time no matter when you come, though the restaurant itself is lively enough and has plenty of customers.  There's a cool shelf towards the right side of the restaurant in the back with a lot of superhero figurines.  The menu is big for a HK style afternoon tea cafe.  Unfortunately, the food is a hit or miss here.  I've had lunch items which were decent, and some other fried rice which was terrible.  Their lunch items come with a soup (asian style or borscht) and a drink with the usual +$ for cold drinks.  There is a button to push for service but it's better to just wave the waitresses down  Portions are very standard and even a tad bit larger than Congee Queen, but I would say the quality does not match Congee Queen or Golden Pheonix up the street."}
{"text":"Sister company of Ming Kei in Scarborough. Same chef. I think it's pretty decent and maybe better than Phoenix. Kept most of the design from previous Japanese restaurant. Clean, good service, good price, good portions. I got the soft she'll crab fried rice ($12.95) and I thought they would give me tiny pieces of soft shell crab and have to dig for them but there were actually many pieces ans big too. Overall I give this place a good thumbs up.   Dine in guests also get free Chinese news paper (either Ming Pao or Sing Tao), that's a dollar savings on its own!!   They have specials for everything, and dim sum too. But during hi-tea hours (around 3:15pm) it'll be the busiest so be ready to wait a while."}
{"text":"In Markham, a HK style diner is almost within 10 min from any place, so how does this place stand out? If the fact that it's owned by the guy who owns Ming's (another popular HK cafe south of Pacific mall) doesn't peak your interest, then maybe the thousands of dollars of expensive iron man figures will? No? Well let's talk about the food: it's typical hk style level. I tried two breakfast specials for the sake of this review - luncheon meat instant noodles and corn beef egg sandwich with oatmeal. Both are average in taste and portions. But for $6 each what do you expect? Fast, efficient, service with economical typical dishes. If you're in the mood for cheap hk diner food, check it out, your wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often for breakfast or when I'm craving some cheap chinese breakfast foods like macaroni in soup because they have an all day breakfast menu for ~$7! The food here is pretty cheap for the most part because they have a lot of combo deals. The restaurant is really big so for the most part you won't have to wait EXCEPT during breakfast on the weekends where it can get really busy."}
{"text":"A perfectly acceptable HK style cafe. The service is quite good to be honest, and the restaurant itself is fairly spacious (unlike Phoenix and others). Their milk tea is tasty and the food is above average. Nothing that will knock your socks off but that's hard to find at establishments like these.   I've had a few things from their menu, and today I tried to Korean style pork chop cutlet with rice. The pork chop was fried really well, a nice light batter and not oily at all. I really enjoyed it. Came with a soup and tea.   The pricing is on par with other HK style cafes, but you also get a free newspaper if you're into that. Lots of competition in the area, so I expect them to remain competitive and provide decent service."}
{"text":"This is a typical Hong Kong style cafe, but the price is a little too high for this type of food.  A typical lunch would be around $11 plus tax.  The decor was your typical modern design with a slightly dark grayish floor with light colour table and slightly darker chair.  The lighting is soft and not too bright.   They have way too many items on their menu.  It took me a while to go thru all the items.  I decided to have to steam rice with shrimp wrapped in lotus leaf.  It was 15-20 minutes wait, and i waited a bit longer than all my friends at the table.  The meal offers either Chinese soup or English soup. lol!  I prefer the Chinese one since it is usually a soup lighter in a style of light consomme.  I had the typical milk tea as the after meal beverage.  The rice was really fresh and tasty.  It has the rich shrimp aroma throughout the rice and slightly floral smell from the lotus leaf.  It was definitely good.  Service was not bad since one of my friends is a regular here.  Although a little pricey for this style of food, but it was worthy."}
{"text":"I would give this ZERO star if I could.   Over priced food items. Inconsistent quality on food. One dish was flavourless while the other was too salty.   Service was the worst. They give you dirty looks when you ask for a table. They give you 'tsk' snickers when you order your food because you almost couldn't decide between your family on what to get. Sounds like their staff are very impatient.   Worst of all is they are friendly to regulars.  Really? The food for a restaurant is only a small portion - don't forget about service and ambiance/environment!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is not busy and they still forgot our order. It's macaroni. It takes 3 minutes to make."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been here a number of times. They continue to provide delicious food and service. We enjoy trying new items on restaurant's menus. Especially restaurants like Kitchen M with a large menu. Tonight we arrived around 7:30 pm after church and was seated at a nice table because the waitress knew that I need good space because I'm not a skinny man. We were greeted with a smile and the waitress wanted to make sure we were comfy. We received our soup less than 5 minutes after we ordered and the plates started coming after that.  We ordered 4 dishes all together and some steamed rice. We had green beans in a garlic sauce, General Tsao's chicken with delicious mixed vegetables, Sweet and sour grouper and Shredded duck and vermicelli noodles. It was all so delicious!   Sweet & Sour Grouper:  The grouper was lightly battered and fresh and tasty.. mixed in were thin onions with shredded carrots. The sweet and sour sauce was perfect, not too sweet.   Stir Fried Green Beans in a Garlic Sauce:  The green beans were stir fried with a delicious garlic sauce. The beans were cooked properly, not mushy.. just a perfect crunch when eaten. The sauce mixed perfectly with the steamed rice.  Shredded Duck with Vermicelli Noodles:  Another tasty dish. Mixed with onions and carrots, it came piping hot! We enjoyed this because the duck was cut up small, not big chunks like we've had in other restaurants.  General Tsao Chicken:  This dish was excellent as well. We probably wouldn't ordered this again because we were hoping it was a little more spicy. We are not big fans of General Tsao Chicken, but we wanted to at least try it. The chicken was tender and tasty. Mixed with green peppers and onions.  Dessert:  Two desserts came with our meal. My wife choose the Mung beans dessert and I had the Mango pudding. An amazing end to the meal.   The restaurant is not a fancy restaurant. It's loud and there's lots of action! Lots of families enjoying their meals and the people gathered with them. Like at home. We like the buzzer system they have on the tables. We rang for \"Drink Service\" because I wanted some cold water. Two minutes later... bada boom! I was enjoying my ice water! We like Kitchen M and will keep going because, it's not hard on the pocket book.. and most of all the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"I was indecisive when studying their menus. They have so so so many choices. I am not exaggerated. Definitely true. It is a great menus which overwhelmingly cause people like me indecisive or mind changing on food orders. It makes you wanna return again for other choices.  Love this part as we customers have more options.    My Kitchen is an authentic HK style tea and food restaurant. Afternoon menu start at 230pm, small portion for noodle in soup for hungry lady like me. I really like their red bean French toast, I can only find it from here.  Definitely a wonderful addition of HK style tea house in Markham.  I love it spacious and order buttons so you don't have to wave your hand or scream out loud. :) love their French toast thick one . They did a good job and make me return 2x at least . One star lost because from my visit history their size of any afternoon tea set soup noodle is always smaller  than other regular items and the quality of ho fun can be improved. I rather spend a regular price for a decant size of noodle.    Try their French toast with red bean from the afternoon set menu, it is my favorite not overly sweet. Their Milk tea are okay. not better and worse. It is generally an acceptable cheap eat place and adequate service. The greeter from the bar is always so welcoming as soon as you walk in ( if the young man is working) :)"}
{"text":"A traditional HK cafe-style restaurant.  The atmosphere of the restaurant itself is quite relaxing.  Lots of open space and comfortable seating.  My family and I went at around 7 PM and there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated fairly quickly.  The menu offers a variety of choices, from individual items to set meals for larger groups.  They also have lunch and dinner specials for a good price.  I was excited to see an all-day breakfast section (because come on, it's never the wrong time for sausage and eggs), but that quickly changed when I realized that there were only two items in that section.  What a tease.    We opted to order a bunch of dishes to share, so we got a beef curry with spaghetti (that interestingly came with a side of croutons, cheese, raisins and sunflower seeds), soft-shell crab fried rice and two noodle dishes.  I was most excited for the fried rice, but it ended up being pretty bland and overall disappointing.  The curry was tasty, but I didn't have too much as my spice tolerance is basically non-existent.  The other noodle dishes were good, but nothing amazing.  We ended off the meal with a dessert of green bean soup, which was quite tasty.  The service itself wasn't the greatest.  The restaurant wasn't packed by any means, but the waitresses didn't seem very attentive to our needs.  We had to wait a while for anyone to come and clear some of the finished plates off our of table.  Same goes for refilling our tea.    Overall, nothing too special."}
{"text":"OK... another HK fast food Rest., well this is not my first time here however this time was the worst service ever.  Walked in, standing there for 10 mins, no one came to greet us (party of 2), mind you, there are empty tables, finally got a table.  Ordered food and drinks, I have ordered a lemon iced tea without sugar, but it came super sweet, I asked one of the server to change it, which I got an attitude person, anyways asked to change my drink.  5 mins or so my drink came back, I was like wait a min, the straw have the same lipstick colour as what I was wearing, so they have given me the same cup that I returned... yup of course it is super sweet...wow, unbelievable...! I did not expect super service when I know I am eating at a Chinese fast food rest... but still how can you give the same cup, same drink to a customer that was returned? Wow....."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Cozy kind of place.  Its a nice HK cafe kind of place. Serves you tea. Free WiFi. Food is pretty good and portions are decent. Lots of room for large groups or just a couple of people. Perfect for a quick bite. Would definitely come back for food!"}
{"text":"Only been here once for breakfast. The place had 4 customers besides me and my hubby. I ordered a chinese breakfast, consisting of daily congee and a choice of dim sum. I got the pan fried turnip cake. The congee was peas and sliced fish. It was ok, bit bland and watery. My husband got a bowl of soup rice vermicelli and an egg sandwich. He said his food was ok. The prices are cheap here and food is ok, not great, but you really can't expect much for the price you pay. They offer lots of dim sum choices too but why get frozen dim sum from here, when you can buy some from T & T and steam it yourself.  Ok for a quick bite to eat, if you can read chinese, you can get a free newspaper too. Er, no I haven't been back since."}
{"text":"4 stars  Your typical quick fix for fast chinese diner/cafe style foods.  We had the sweet and sour pork, mushroom beef slices, BBQ pork vermicelli soup,  fried pork chop, and veggie dish.  The food was good.  All around decent flavor and the soup noodle broth was delish!  The free starter soup is super yummy (was told no MSG) and free dessert in the end was a nice touch.  The soya bean dessert was no good, but the mango pudding was good.  The servers were really friendly.  Child-friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very disappoint with this place!!! My wife and I went there for afternoon tea with our service dog and they refuse to give us service cause we have a service dog.  We were basically told to leave!   I told the owner that they cannot refuse service to us in an establishment under the Toronto bylaw.  They say they don't know anything about this service dog bylaws.  I even show them the actual laws from the city of Toronto bylaws webpage and they still don't understand.  Well, I guess they lose us as regular customers from now on.  We will never go there again with that kind of ignorance!  Too bad I can't give them a negative stars rating."}
{"text":"I don't know why lots of reviews indicate that the service is bad here, but actually I received pretty service every time I came here :0(because I can speak Cantonese?) food here is okay, but it is a good place to eat cuz i can have many choices here!"}
{"text":"This is my second favorite HK style cafe for breakfast/lunch/dinner other then New city. This place is pretty consistent and their milk tea is on point.  That's what makes or breaks a HK style cafe. If their milk tea sucks,  then I won't be coming back.  But I give this place a thumbs up for their milk tea. Nice and strong. Couple be a little bit hotter though.   Their afternoon tea menu has gotten better. I remember  when they first opened it was a bit lacking and the choices weren't as great. I noticed they improved it... I'm willing to try more.   Overall, opens early and closes late for snacks. Great job!!! I will be a regular here."}
{"text":"The menu have a wide selection. Tonight I have a bit of a headache so I ordered the congee with century egg and fish. It was ok; nothing to write home about and the other parties on the table ordered lobster rice and greens with fish. The lobsters were the small ones and the fish were fillet, at least no bones. For dessert, tonight was a small bowl of tofu pudding. Overall, this is always a decent place with reasonable price for a quick Chinese meal."}
{"text":"Ordered the congee with fish balls, beef fried rice, chow mein and a chicken ramen.  First thing we noticed is that the chow mein was the smallest we've ever seen. Quantity wise it wasn't good. The best dish was probably the beef fried rice but quite honestly, Congee Queen or Congee Wong is much better.  The service wasn't there as we had to get our own cutlery from the front.  The bill came up to about $37.  Food wasn't that good either.  The only good thing is that it's not as crowded as Congee Wing and Congee Queen.  We were still hungry.  The existing reviews for this place is accurate.  1.5 stars out of 5   I think"}
{"text":"If you don't want to line up for Phoenix, Kitchen M is your next option!   I must say that they have a lot of variety of food in comparison to other HK style cafe. Their food is alright and their price is reasonable.   The only thing that I would say don't order from there is their Ramen. I appreciate that they offer something different but Ramen is just not their thing. The soup base was weird and their noodles was not the typical Ramen."}
{"text":"I came here with my family as they had advertised in the Chinese newspaper for some set Peking duck meals that includes soup and dessert. We wanted to try it out for lunch and had called ahead to make sure we're able to get that meal for lunch. They took a reservation for us and confirmed that we are able to do as we wish.  We came here for lunch on a Saturday of Chinese New Year and the restaurant was about 2/3 full, but they had ample staff there, I'm not sure if this is a normal thing or they had anticipated that it would be super busy.  We wanted to add a few more dishes and had asked for a server's suggestion, she suggested the best bang for our buck and ones that would be more suitable for my grandfather. We got a steamed lotus leaf fried rice with shrimp and I really enjoyed that one. The Hong Kong style milk tea was also great.  The Peking duck was ok, it wasn't as crispy as I have had it from other places. We were also served a whole fish, a soup, a seafood vegetable dish and noodle soup and they were also acceptable. At the end of our meal, we were waiting for our desserts, but we were told they only have dessert at dinner, but we had called about this meal and they said they're able to serve it at lunch and no where in the advertisement did it say dinner only. We were given some sort of kids' mango yoghurt dessert as a replacement, better than nothing I guess.  I am however, a bit confused as to what kind of restaurant to classify this, because my family had a 5-course Peking duck meal, something you usually get from a Chinese restaurant, but most of the menu, and the decor suggests a Hong Kong style cafe. Confusion aside, there's an array of items on the menu that will probably take you long to decide. Variety is the spice of life and if you're with a group of people who can't decide on one kind of food to eat, this would be great place to take them."}
{"text":"The servers are half friendly and half slow, as well as the food.... half comes and you would be done before the rest comes! com here if you want to chill and air for awhile, not if you are in a hurry.  the food is decent tho it's a hit or miss depending on what you get."}
{"text":"Been there many times but my recent visit was a big disappointment that I won't be going back unless I run out of options. We went in for a quick dinner and was greet by a server with bad attitudes. We were simply asking if we can substitute a shrimp ball with more of the fish pastes in the same noodle dish because my husband is allergic to shrimps. The server replied with \"no, because it's pointless\". I think she missed the point that there are other non-shrimp things my husband can eat from the same dish. Then she rushed us through the menu, told us to choose something else quick (it was only 8:45pm and it wasn't busy). Food came and realized the same lady put the wrong order in. We finished eating at 9:15pm and was told by the same lady that we needed to pay the bill and wrap up our take away now because they are closing at 10 (yes 45 mins later). Food quality wise, this restaurant is only acceptable, their milk tea is average - on some days they are bad. On top, they increased their price recently."}
{"text":"Just an update so don't expect a whole tapestry.  Food was okay so it could've been 3* but was the service ever horrible. I don't know what was in the water that made these ladies snappy and rude but that day, they were very rude when getting the bill for us.  I know I don't usually incorporate service into Chinese places but there IS a minimum, and the minimum is human decency and basic respect.   I don't appreciate the cut-eyes, ???"}
{"text":"Think this restaurant must be affiliated with Ming's Noodle at Kennedy and Passmore.   Menu is same but here they have more options such as Peking duck, bbq pork, japanese ramen and bamboo basket steamed rice.  Variety is good and decor is more spacious and modern than Mings.   However, dishes are about $1 or $2 more than Ming's.  And service not as good.  Food came fast but waitresses not as friendly.  One plus is we got sweet taro tapioca for dessert.  Nicer of all the HK diners in the area but will likely stick to Congee Queen or Oriental Gourmet next door."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this from the perspective that I wanted something quick and cheap...  and this place is descent.  The prices are cheap and they have a large menu.  I tried their breakfast special (satay noodles, eggs sandwich, and hot milk tea) and it was okay.  I felt the beef texture was a bit tough.    But service was quick ... we were in and out of there in 45 mins.    This is the place to go if you want something quick or a late night snack."}
{"text":"Limited options for breakfast but the food is really good ! The service was also fast like when you need someone they're quick to come. Unfortunately they messed my order up twice and then forgot to bring the soya drink out after we mentioned it 3 times."}
{"text":"New place. Sister of Ming Kee in Scarborough but Methinks not....Tried this place yesterday with famiy and I was extremely disappointed....in service, price, quality and everything else...  I mean how can one screw up on a chinese restaurant aka \"cha chaan tang\" its like quick eats...people come in, they order, eat and leave...simple as 1-2-3-4....  Ming Kee use to be a favourite but I think one of the owners left and the quality started going down the slope....so we just stopped going to that location once and for all...  Now this one opened, like the usual, people like to go and try new stuff and if it disappoints...it's time to let everyone know...  So, I ordered the Porkchop rice with Tomato sauce and cheese, which is something safe and slightly easier to do..it clearly said cheese with tomato sauce and porkchop on it...when it arrived...there was no cheese..whatsoever....so I asked and they said...\"Oh, if you order the tomato sauce there is no cheese because we feel cheese does not go right with our tomato sauce\" so why did you put cheese in the menu...thats called deceiving customers...!!!  So I insisted on getting cheese, the plate comes back...and it had \"burnt\" marks over the tomato sauce.....thats what they call adding cheese to it? OMG seriously??? Are you joking me...? Boy; was I upset or what....anyways....the plate and portions are bigger than normal but it taste HORRIBLE...  family member ordered steak with spaghetti, it was tasteless...and black pepper sauce only had the colour...no black pepper sauce taste in it whatsoever...  The pricing is more expensive than some of the popular places in the area like Phoenix and Congee Queen...I AM 100% SURE YOU WILL GET BETTER FOOD there....  After going home, I felt sick and the food felt like it wasn't digesting..even until the next morning....I have no idea what they put in the food but I AM NEVER GOING BACK...  I would be surprised if this business will last over 1 yr...if they keep what they are doing now...."}
{"text":"Second time coming here. Terrible & rude customer service will not go again; happened on Oct 25 2017 10-11 AM . I went to get take-out and I asked (all dialogues in Cantonese) if they accepted cards for payment. She said, \"Wow so little and you want to pay with card\". Then I paid with cash, and then she said, \"Don't play around kid\". After this, she gave me some change in USD, when I asked if I could get a Canadian quarter instead of American, she said, \"USD is worth more than CAD\". I didn't care because I can't legally use it in Canada and it is inconvenient. She eventually took it back and gave me a new one, but I can sense the negativity from her."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the service is terrible. We came into the restaurant and they were just like \"sit over there\". The waitresses are rude and sassy. Would recommend for the food but not the service"}
{"text":"Hong Kong style restaurant. The soup (that comes with the combo) isn't hot enough. The curry beef isn't bad. Typical HK style \"cha chan tang\""}
{"text":"This is the ever-changing restaurant as I would call it. It seems as though every single restaurant that takes up this space fails to last. This space once was some sort of western style restaurant, then it turned into a AYCE sushi place, eventually into an a la cart sushi restaurant and now finally a HK Style Cafe. It's almost like this space is cursed.  Anyhow with the history lesson aside let's begin! My disclaimer is that I never had great expectations prior to going in and you shouldn't either. The very idea of HK Syle Cafe equates to affordable and decent tasting food that is served fast. And with that I believe this place delivers. I won't say the food is mind blowing in any way but it does the job. Some dishes are strong (like stir fried noodles and rice) while others are a bit weak (baked rice, soup noodles..etc) but what this place does have is variety. The menu is vast and very creative with enough variety to satisfy anyone. Another plus is the affordability; you get enormous portions for Scarborough prices. As if that's not enough of an incentive, they offer all guests a free dessert at the end of your meal. The desserts they serve are not the rejects either (unlike most places where they serve those red bean/green bean porridge crap that noone touches).  The service is attentive and pleasant the last few times I have been there. No complaints. I just hope this one is here to stay and break the string of bad luck this space has endured.  If you're hungry and need your HK Cafe fix, stop by."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but really not special or made specially well. Ive had breakfast, lunch and dinner here before and it's like they don't put much care into the way dishes.   And to add basic things is always some ridiculous extra charge. Hot chocolate, coffee, etc is regular but Ovaltine which is the same is 1.00 more. You get a french toast with peanut butter and condensed milk and they just drizzle enough for two bites. Honestly, what are you trying to save on?   Wouldn't recommend this place and wouldn't really want to return."}
{"text":"While at Ming's Noodle Cafe, my parents noticed a sign on the wall that indicated that there was a \"Kitchen M\" in Markham.  We looked it up later and realized it's located across from Markville Mall, which we frequent.  So we decided to check it out.  This place is much bigger than Ming's -- I assume they're all run by the same people (hence the ad in Ming's).  It's so big that there's little devices on the tables for you to get a waitress to come over to get your order, get the bill, or ask for service.  I suppose this is where the lack of service comes in -- if you don't ask for it, the waitresses might even ignore you!  Overall, the menus seem more or less the same as Ming's.  Food quality seems the same as well so that's a good thing.  It's your typical HK cafe fare that is decently priced.  Definitely coming back here if I want some HK cafe food before heading over to Markville Mall."}
{"text":"2.5 stars   I got the Malay Chicken Curry - comes with potato salad, bun (good), vegetable soup (good), milk tea (ok) - curry was spicy but no hint of Malay flavor or coconut...  - chicken was tender but personally I don't like previously deep-fried chicken ...  - rice was super hard and dry   Price is about $1 more than other HK style in the area.."}
{"text":"If you're in the Markham area, chances are you've accompanied your parents to HK style cafes your whole life. If you haven't, let me tell about the french toast I consumed on my last visit.  For $4.95, imagine a melted layer of peanut butter-y goodness sandwiched between two slices of crustless, brick toast. This combination is then dipped in egg and DEEP FRIED to a crispy golden brown. On top sits a pool of thick condensed milk. Salivating yet?   This decadent snack is not for the faint of heart (or for those at risk for diabetes).  Other food I've had here has been okay. The portions are quite generous and the   breakfast/lunch/afternoon tea specials come with coffee/tea/soy milk.   Lots of seating, and like many HK cafes, you have to wave down the staff if you need anything.  The only thing that was super gross was the tape of dead bugs hanging above our table. Also, the wifi isn't very reliable. But there's lots of choice and something for everyone. Great for groups :)"}
{"text":"Meh, typical Chinese fast food resto, with sub par quality in food.  Service is on point though.  Seats are not comfortable, though nice decor.  Chinese rice roll : way too thick"}
{"text":"This place has everything; sandwiches, baked rice, noodle, congee, dim sum... you named it, they have it ........... Was it good?!  Nope........ I came here twice.  I had a beef brisket noodle the first time.  The beef was not tender,  the soup was bland and not hot.   Came here again for a late lunch and had a pork cutlet with fries.  They served me the thinnest, driest and toughest pork cutlet.  I don't think even a Shun knife would have that cutability to cut it into pieces.  Would we go to a restaurant that serves everything but don't have anything good?"}
{"text":"I'm the type of person that doesn't eat out a lot and we find this place pretty good compare to congee queen just down the street. This place has a lot less MSG than any HK cafe or congee place. Service was decent but what matters the most is the food taste. I would recommend this place over other congee places"}
{"text":"The food is always spectacular, don't get me wrong. I love the flavour of all their foods. The best ones is their make your own noodle bowl, and their steamed rice. Their breakfast options are okay - wish the toast would be crispier. The service is better this time, at least our waitress did not get our drinks or our food orders wrong. Gneerally some of their staff needs to improve on their attitudes towards their customers. I get that it's a SUnday afternoon and you are busy, but there is no need to roll your eyes at your customers, especially when we as a large group already agreed to splitting up in order for her to seat us easier (yes i'm talking about the hostess). Anyway love the food, but they really need to work on their service... one of the rare occasions where i had to consider cutting my tip or no tip."}
{"text":"Everything here was average. The service, the food tasting, the price.. very typical hong kong style cafe in markham. Nothing stood out or seemed below average than other places. They have a lot of variety in their menu though, way more than other hk style cafes."}
{"text":"After all the food I ate at the CNE I still had room for more. I guess all that walking made me hungry. I had the beef tenderloin with white rice. The beef was slightly tough only and tasted great with the sweet sauce.  Service was fast, food was pretty good and price is very affordable. I hope this place is here to stay as its really convenient being so close to my parents home."}
{"text":"2.5/5, +.5 for service  The long anticipated stall that used to be Toro Sushi has finally opened. After passing by this place at least 10 times a week, I finally saw the open sign lit on Tuesday. Since I was busy yesterday, I decided to wait until tonight to eat here. For 9pm, this place was ridiculously busy. However I assume it was full of people who wanted to try this place for the first time, so I'm not expecting the full seated load to last.   The menu here is very extensive. There was your typical HK style cafe options, as well as dim sum. There are two featured items on the menu which are also advertised outside the restaurant along the wall facing Highway 7. I decided to try one of them, which was the Shanghai style beef noodle soup (forgot the exact term).  As we were waiting for our food, one of the employees gave us two 10% off cards, which are valid until January 31, 2015. The meal itself was also 10% off for their grand opening special.  The food took a good 15-20 minutes to come, however the iced lemon and iced milk teas both came rather quick. The milk tea here seems to be better than the lemon tea, as my dad found the milk tea to be good and I found the lemon tea to be mediocre. As for the noodle soup...it was also mediocre. Edible at least, but definitely not what I would say memorable.  There are a lot of other items in the menu that could be worth trying, but I'm gonna wait for other Yelpers to review this restaurant before considering coming back."}
{"text":"This place is utterly disturbing. The fact that I paid almost $7 for the beef curry with pancake (roti) and received one piece of beef (in a bowl smaller than my cup) and a small piece of \"pancake\" is almost insulting. Impossible to see why I paid that that much for something so little."}
{"text":"No respect to customer at all. Terrible service, never come again. Waiters should be retrained. You should never swear to your customer"}
{"text":"Food are bad and expensive along with terrible service. Curry chicken rice 11.99 and other place never go above 10. Drink are bad too. Not recommended"}
{"text":"Came here because Congee Queen was packed with a 25min wait.  Forget about that !!  In this day and age, there are other restaurants around that are just as good, especially if you are hungry.  This is one of them!  Sunday night around 6pm, table for 7.  Walked right in and got a table right away. I knew what i was going to order from looking at the menu last time i was here. (Soft shell crab fried rice). MMmmmm, was not disappointed. The place was not extremely busy, but busy enough. The staff was much friendlier this time around.  Push the button, and they came right away!  Quantity of food was good!! Had to take food home.  Still hard to pick dishes, you have to come here a few times and just order your fav dishes !!  4 stars for this experience!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this new place out. When we got there we were greeted by the staff. The restaurant is well lit and clean. When we were looking over the menu,  the waitress was standing close by and often asked us if we were ready to order (wish she could have given us our space). I ordered the wonton soup and my wife ordered the steak with rice. Her steak came with soup, salad, bun and a drink. Her steak was big but there was a lot of fat. My wonton soup was good but I had better. They gave us tofu desert, but it was not that great. Will I go back?  Probably not since I can get better quality HK food nearby."}
{"text":"I've come here on many occasions. In true HK cafe style, the menu is ginormous - classic Taiwan dishes, ramen, build-your-own noodle soup and of course, the HK classics. I decided to order none of these on this occasion and order the poutine. Unexpectedly delicious! The fries are exactly what you think - huge and super crispy in true Chinese restaurant fried style. The gravy was lighter than your traditional beef gravy and a little less salty which was nice for the body. The hot gravy + hot fries meant that the cheese curds were perfectly squeaky and perfectly warm. The milk tea here is also pretty decent and really a must have. This place does get pretty busy so expect a moderate wait if you're coming on the weekend!"}
{"text":"We came in for early lunch, seem they were packed for breakfast since there were alot of tables waiting for clean up. Anyways, they sit us down and we ordered. They have few menus put on the tables but somehow they are duplicate menu that printed n looks different but the content are the same.  The price seems above average however after seeing the food and they comes in a good potions so thats ok. The food came pretty quick and it taste right."}
{"text":"Pretty decent but so spacious!  Very good for kids and you can order dim sum! They're open!!  Free wifi and awesome :)"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to be honest. Food is decent and service is okay. We received a free newspaper so that's pretty nice"}
{"text":"Oh Kitchen M... Food wise this place is mediocre and there is Phoenix just up a bit farther on McCowan.  I've been here twice now and both times, the service we received is pretty bad. It seems almost all the staff are grumpy or have some sort of attitude. I will say though, that there is one server who is sassy but entertaining because of how blunt she is.  The restaurant itself is decently furnished. As a fan of Hot Toys, the owner here has a decent display of various Iron Man figures.   Go at your own risk!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5 This place is located on McCowan Rd and Hwy 7 E in the plaza with Subway. Lots of parking spotsout front, and more spots in the back.  [SERVICE] - 5/5 Our server was very nice! She made a couple recommendations and was very personable. Severalother ladies checked on our table and made sure everything was good.  [DÉCOR] - 4/5 Booths were comfortable, and had a more modern Hong Kong Style Café vibe.  [QUALITY] - 3/5 Average-quality ingredients, but you get what you pay for.  [ORDER] - 4/5 - Lobster on Steamed Rice - $19.95: such good value for the large portion size (there wasenough food for 2 people)! The order came in a big bamboo dim sum steamer and wegot a whole steamed lobster on a bed of fried rice. The taste of fried rice became a bittoo one-dimensional after a while, so I would suggest ordering other dishes on the side.  - All-Day Special - Egg Sandwich + Butter Toast + Shredded Pork & Pickle on VermicelliSoup + Milk Tea - $6.45: so much food and so inexpensive! I think this is great for thosewho enjoy a variety of Hong Kong style breakfast foods.  [OVERALL] - 4/5 Service was great, the ladies who helped us out were so friendly. Quality of food was averagebut portions and value were fair. I would recommend this place if you crave a simple andcomforting meal."}
{"text":"Typical HK style cafe right across Markville.   This place has a huuuge menu. Food is ok la in my opinion. Ordered the curry with pancake which needs more pancake lol and the black pepper beef noodles which had a huge portion!!   The short haired lady with the bob is pretty rude. When she took back our menus she just threw them onto the table beside us loooool. But the other one is pretty nice so she makes up for it.   They didnt have wifi when I came in even though they advertised free wifi outside their door... Boo!"}
{"text":"Okay, I take back everything I said in my last review.  I came here last week for a quick lunch during my break at work (1 hour) and I wanted to get in and out.  The place was probably 1/4 filled on a Saturday afternoon and my boyfriend and I were seated quickly.  I ordered a baked cream ham and chicken rice and a ham & egg sandwich (toasted). The one thing was absolute negative service.  I'm okay with the \"Asian\" service i.e. efficient, quick, no effort at communication besides taking your order - that I have 0 problem with. But if I'm getting attitude while ordering for no reason then I am 100% unhappy to be there. While ordering the lady had 0 idea of what I wanted from the menu while I even pointed at the menu and I do speak fluent Cantonese.  When I told her I wanted my bread toasted for the sandwich she literally looked at me like I was insulting her and told me it would cost extra.   WHY DOES IT COST EXTRA TO TOAST BREAD??? I said it was fine and I'd pay.   The sandwich came with the bread untoasted & this waitress literally dropped it off and cross-countried to the other side of the resto.  She avoided my table for the rest of my meal. The baked rice was 100% tasteless.  They deprived the entire dish of salt.   They took half an hour to bring everything out.  I am so completely unhappy with their service, the time it took to cook, and their food."}
{"text":"Had brunch with a friend here. I ordered the baked beef brisket and spaghetti in Portuguese sauce.  This is more or less my go to dish at these hk diner type places. I can't say it was the best one I've had but I can't say it was the worst.   The meal comes with soup and a drink. I got the veggie soup and cold hk milk tea.   The portions were pretty big. i forced myself to finish my meal and was absolutely stuffed. the pieces of beef brisket were huge, definitely not bite sized chunks. the Portuguese sauce also had potatoes and corn in it too. The spaghetti was cooked well.  Because it is close by, and the options for hk diners within the 10 or so minute radius from where i live are so limited, I'd come back."}
{"text":"I don't think there is anything to write about and I need not bother since most of the reviews here do it justice.  Cobbled-together restaurant that I can only describe as a cross between New City Restaurant, Congee Queen, and Firefly Seafood.    New City feel = lack of service, all-day option menus with drinks, same tea service cup and saucer Congee Queen feel = lack of service, trying to mash together congee menu, noodles menu, fried rice menu, snacks menu along with New City and Firefly Seafood menu Firefly Seafood feel = lack of service, overpriced, battered shrimp on menu, spaghetti options on top of traditional rice/noodle/breakfast options, getting annoyed at customer.   Shameful characteristics that just never go away: sticky tables (even sticky sugar spouts!), dirty bathroom, dry food stuck on cutlery, zero service, customer berating*  Customer berating - you don't have to bark at me twice that if I pay by card I need to go to the counter. I heard you the first time. Use some Sherlocking skills please: If I acknowledged your directions the first bark, but I am still sitting at the table, and you see that across me there is another set of keys and a mobile phone, that should probably help you deduct that I am actually waiting for my dining partner to return to the table from the restrooms before I abandon the table to go pay the tab.  Customer service advice: DO NOT TRY TO GRAB MY CREDIT CARD OUT OF MY HAND. HAND ME THE CARD SERVICE TERMINAL AND TELL ME TO TAP OR INSERT CARD.  If tapping card doesn't have Tip settings set up, DO NOT GET FRUSTRATED AT ME AND TELL ME THAT YOU CAN'T RECEIVE A TIP BECAUSE I DIDN'T INSERT CARD for the tip option.  And then you have the guts to ask me if I have cash.  Because you know what I will do right? I will gladly offer you my credit card again and tell you to charge me on tip 20%. But it ain't my fault you were too gutless to follow-through and agree with my suggestion and only say to me \"next time, bring cash\".    ...Because you know, of course, there will be a next time right?    I think the \"M\" in Kitchen M. might stand for minus, minimal, missing, marred, miserly, menial, I can go on......"}
{"text":"I don't really have high expectation for Hong Kong Style Cafe as I just want something fast, affordable and a menu with varieties.   Kitchen M is definitely a good addition to the neighbourhood. I was a little overwhelmed by the menu and all the all day set options. What to eat? What should I order? What is good?  The food here is not amazing but will do the job if you are in the area. Service is fast and friendly.  ??????+?? ($9.95) Duck Leg Noodle with Side Veggie comes with a choice of drink was quite decent. The duck was tender and soft. Their milk tea was also quite good.  I will be back to try out other items."}
{"text":"Usually I do not expect much service from a \"HK Style\" tea house but this one is exceptionally bad, to a point I felt irritated. Food was just ok. The only thing worth mentioning is a cleaner than normal bathroom.  Many good choices close by that I will definitely by-pass this one."}
{"text":"It is all about market positioning.  In my opinion, when a restaurateur aims at a certain market, whether the restaurant is good depends on whether it delivers delicious food in a hygienic environment, and fulfils the expectation/norm of that market.  If it exceeds expectation, great, but IMO, \"good\" only requires meeting expectation.  Maybe my expectation of a HK cafe is not particularly demanding.  Maybe I have missed the poorly reviewed period of the grand opening.  During the first visit recently (in 2016), I find Kitchen M meeting expectation of a HK cafe..  The food is flavourful, the portion is satisfying, the pricing is on par with market, the value is sufficient, the ambiance is pleasant, the staff is efficient.  Kitchen M is great for lunch and a value dinner.  The food isn't so good that it could demand high prices, and Kitchen M doesn't charges high prices.  Here you go: it is A-OK."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get some food but it gets confusing when there's like ten different menus they give you that you're not too sure what to order.  Prices are reasonable and enjoyed the education noodle with mushroom."}
{"text":"Went in on a weeknight as I was craving for some hk style food and was in the neighbourhood. The menu had a huge selection on items which was good but it was very hard for me to choose since I wanted to try everything. Tried the chef recommendation which was the shrimp fried rice for $13 and it was good. The portion was ginormous which i had to take home as the waitress told me this can feed for 3 people. Also ordered the chicken skewers and they were alright. I really enjoyed everything about it except that it closes early. Will be back for round 2!"}
{"text":"Don't  expect anything too fancy it is a traditional HK cafe style located in an old plaza that has seen multiple restaurants that has gone through there. The newly renovated restaurant sure beats the old restaurants that used to be there.  Ordered the pork chop, chicken steak with rice and tomato sauce combo so I can compare it to the also \"cheap\" HK cafe a few blocks north on McCowan.   Overall impression is not bad. The vegetable soup had real ingredients (lots of veggies), the tomato sauce has real tomato not a suace made of ketchup so it actually taste proper.   I would recommend going back again, compare to a lot of sub-par restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Would give this place 0 stars if that were possible. Food sucks, service sucks, the atmosphere as soon as you walk in sucks. Everything sucks about this place. Hopefully it closes down, it's literally an eyesore because I'm reminded of the incredibly terrible one-time service I visited. I'd advise everyone to stay away unless you fancy crap service and food."}
{"text":"This is your typical fast food HK style cafe. Lots of seating space. Free wifi. Relatively big parking lot. I'd say it's a very \"average\" restaurant with a reasonably priced menu and average portion sizes. The service was also average, but I wouldn't expect more for a HK style cafe. I'd recommend the BBQ duck; it tastes great and didn't have too much fat on it. Their milk tea is very smooth and delicious. I would go back just for the milk tea. Each table is entitled to a free newspaper of either Singtao or Ming pao (if available). Overall, I don't think there is anything special about this place but if you're looking for a quick brunch spot, this could be it."}
{"text":"Our group of three came here for lunch since we were in the area. 2 of us ordered the all day special that includes a sandwich, noodle soup and a drink. The third person opted for a rice dish on their menu ( pork chop and chicken steak on rice with a cream sauce).   The first sandwich came before we got any tea or our drinks or even any cutlery at all. We had to ask for them before they gave it to us. Even then, they didn't even give us the correct cutlery for our meal. Both the noodle soup came before the second sandwich got here. The drinks for our meals finally came afterwards. 20 mins later we were still waiting for the rice dish. By then, the two noodle soups were already finished. I should mention that there was another single customer sitting next to us. When the rice dish finally arrived it went to him first. We told the server that we ordered a rice dish too and we were pretty sure that was ours since the customer just arrived 5 mins ago. She asked us if we ordered this dish in Chinese and we asked for a menu to tell her. She ended up getting the receipt saying it's for table 19a (our table). Then she told us to remember what we ordered next time to avoid the confusion... The service was terrible and the food was mediocre. The soups were bland not worth mentioning at all. The one star is for the milk tea which was pretty decent.  $30 for 3 people. We had to ask for the bill twice and they kept confusing the tables."}
