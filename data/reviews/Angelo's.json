{"text":"My husband and I got pizza here about 2 weeks ago. The pizza was just ok. There didn't seem to be enough sauce so it had a dry taste. The restaurant seemed nice and the staff was very friendly. I think next time we will try one of their other dishes."}
{"text":"If you like a dark and cozy restaurant with excellent pasta & pizza, get to Angelo's!"}
{"text":"The chicken parmesan was not real chicken.  It was a pressed, chicken butthole faux-meat lie.  I just ate a giant chicken mcnugget drenched in bland marinara sauce ($14).  And, it was BURNED.  How the f*!#! does this pass as food?  PATHETIC!   I'll be waiting patiently for your response... I dare you."}
{"text":"What happened Tuesday night! They weren't even busy. The bartender (Mike) ignored our empty beer glasses twice even though we held them up to get his attention, there was no hostess to seat my husband and myself. The bus boy seated us and then no one came to our table until we had to ask a waitress where our waitress was. The special was gone so the waitress gave us a free appetizer for our long wait. The food was alright. Then waiting forever for our check we were given a check that was not ours. There was no waitress around so we left cash for the check we were given. I don't think we'll be going back."}
{"text":"Great food & service. One of my favorite place to go for dinner and drinks. The staff is very friendly. My boyfriend and I love to sit out on the patio.  Alway a nice time."}
{"text":"Spinach artichoke dip that is absolutely delicious and the pizza in the place is out of this world.   They use fresh ingredients and cheeses and the sauce is scrumptious.   Looking forward to coming back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Once again an awesome evening with new friends at Angelo's!!!!! The atmosphere is always on point, with great natural lighting and a cozy feeling! I cannot wait for their patio season! Consistently a friendly and fun staff. I had the Pesto Farfalle sub Italian sausage and it came out perfectly seasoned and my hubbie had the ribs! Holy moly they are to die for! They are super meaty and it all falls right off the bone, I want more and more!  Angelo's is a great place to bring friends, and always share a laugh with super dedicated owners Rick and Sue!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place after reading the other reviews. It wasn't bad, I would say 2.5 stars. I want food to be as good as what I cook or better and their  food was not even on par with my own cooking. It's like Olive Garden, fills the void but not memorable. There were four of us and no one was very excited about their meal.  The worst was when I took my son to the bathroom. It's down stairs but you could smell urine at the top of the steps. I was done with my meal after that. Sorry, there are many other places in the area to try. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went here last night and had vegetarian and Angelo's favorite. Both flavors were very average.  It is a small restaurant with a nice atmosphere. Service good"}
{"text":"First time eating at Angelo's this weekend and it was delicious! We didn't know what to expect but had been wanting to try it out for awhile now.  The parking lot is a little tight, and a few people were backing their cars into spaces, which upon exiting we realized why, but now we know! :)  You enter into the bar, which was slightly confusing, but go straight back to the dining area. I enjoyed the smaller dining area. A little more intimate of a setting. I didn't count, but I'd guess about 10-15 tables.  We ordered breadsticks for an appetizer, which were just perfect. The marinara they come with is slightly sweet. And the breadsticks themselves, were garlic and buttered up. Yum! Not greasy and soggy, but not over cooked either.  For our main dishes, we ordered the Chicken Pesto Pasta and Baked Mostaccioli (I added chicken). The portions were more than enough, and we had leftovers! Again, everything was cooked just right. The pasta was al dente, and the sauces were amazing. The only downside (if you can even call it that) was there was too much sauce for the chicken pesto pasta. I was like MORE pasta!!!  haha It was so good though. We really enjoyed our meal and the service. Waitress was friendly, knowledgeable on the menu and specials. Very warm and inviting atmosphere, loved the music they had playing lightly in the background.   We will definitely eat again, and maybe even bring the kiddos!"}
{"text":"This little gem is a McFarland outpost of the Angelos in Monona. The actual building sat empty for several years before being thoughtfully and nicely renovated by the folks at Angelos. Make no mistake, it's a small space but they make the best use of it and it never feels tiny. The bar / waiting area is on the smaller side but everyone here is so friendly (employees and customers) it never feels too crowded or awkward. The owner is usually the bartender, and he couldn't be more friendly or welcoming! What a great way to start an evening out. Being affiliated with the Angelos in Monona, I knew that the food here was bound to be delicious. What I didn't expect was there super awesome Friday fish fry! The baked trout with light and flaky and very fresh tasting. Their pasta dishes are always a hit; I am a fan of just the old, traditional red sauce. Also, it's good to note that they're very accommodating when it comes to special food requests. We often eat out with our grandson who has food allergies and Angelo's staff has always been able to make alterations to the menu."}
{"text":"My parents raved about how good the Fish Fry was at Angelo's in McFarland, so since I was home on break from school/work, we decided we'd go there for a nice dinner. My parents both said their meals good (baked cod and cheesy hash browns). Mine however was terrible from the start and I would never go back. First off, you NEVER serve beer with a WARM glass, like NEVER!! Second, the beer battered cod was soggy, flavorless, and gross all around, I thought about sending it back but was ready to leave by then that I just sucked it up and ate it with tarter sauce. The baked potato was coated in salt and was inedible, so I did send that back and got sweet potato fries instead, no better.    To sum it up, I don't think I would ever go back. For all the good reviews around town about this restaurant I was not impressed at all..."}
{"text":"Great service.   Good food. They have the best chocolate martinis around! Kid friendly.  Good outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to frequenting here when i moved into the neighborhood, but after a couple visits will not return.  First visit we got pastas and the spinach artichoke appetizer,  the dip was great- but our main courses were very bland and liquidy.  Expected better meal for the price.  Second visit we tried the pizza, again very disappointed.   We got a taco pizza, typically love taco pizzas, bit this one also bland.  Crust was good, but pretty much no sauce or other flavor to it."}
{"text":"We love almost everything about Angelo's, from the delicous food to the completely remodeled space to the outdoor patio to the warm and welcoming staff. Actually, that's in the wrong order- it's the staff that keep us coming back week after week. Every time we're there, I know that they truly appreciate that we've come in do dine with them, and they do their part to make sure we have a good experience."}
{"text":"Really good food. Very reasonable prices. I like the baked spaghetti!"}
{"text":"Angelo's white pizza is somewhat of a family tradition for me.  I can't say for certain when my clan first trucked out to Monona, but it started a trend that has kept up through the years.  In reality Angelos is a perfectly serviceable Italian-style family restaurant that does pizza and pasta amongst other things, but I couldn't tell you about anything other than the white pizza.  Over the last decade plus I can't remember a single time when I didn't order the same thing.  Normally this would be boring and I'd feel disappointed in myself for such unimaginative thinking, but in the case of Angelo's my nostalgia trumps all.  And it isn't exactly like I'm here every week - I don't make it out to Monona all that often, and I'm lucky if I grace Angelo's with my presence two times in one year.  But when I do, I'm in white pizza heaven.  It's not the be-all, end-all when it comes to pizza, but there's something to the combination of sausage, artichoke hearts, olives and alfredo sauce that is simply amazing.  It's close to my favorite singular meal in the Madison area, and when I think about it I'm tempted to slap down five stars for the pizza alone.    I made my latest trip to Angelo's a week or so back, and it marked the first time I'd been since they went smoke-free.  It's a definite improvement, to be sure.  I was, however, saddened to see that the dining room had been renovated.  It looks perfectly nice, if a bit generic, but before it had real atmosphere.  The walls had been lined with bottles of chianti, the fiaschi (the bottles with straw baskets - I looked that up) decorated by past diners over the years.  It was tradition to order a bottle of chianti and document the occasion with a message or a sketch.  I was told by the waitress that the bottles had deteriorated beyond repair and had to be taken down.  I'd always hoped that one of those bottles had my writing on it.  As much as I love Angelo's, my last trip was just a bit disappointing in terms of service.  The white pizza was excellent as always, but we were left without drink refills for a bit too long.  Maybe it was because it was at the tail end of the night, but the waitstaff came off a bit brisk and the overall vibe wasn't as enjoyable as before.  But maybe that's just me, maybe it was the newness of the dining room that made the night stick out.  Still, Angelo's without the nostalgia remains a pretty decent place, and the first bite of white pizza reminds me of why I'll always keep coming back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! We've tried a number of items on the menu but the pizza is definitely our favorite and the reason we keep coming back. Great service too! It's always nice when the owners come and check on your table."}
{"text":"My family and I happened upon this place while we were in the area. It is VERY SMALL. However, the hostess, server and bartender were outstanding. The food was also great. My husband and I both got pasta dishes and the portions were very large. Which I consider a plus because I love leftovers. You also can't beat $1.50 Hamms beer all day everyday. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because of the very tight dining and bar space. We have a baby so it was difficult to get settled and comfortable with so many people crowding around. I should mention we ate at one of the small bar tables because the small dining room was full."}
{"text":"Lot's of great offerings.   White pizza is great. Red sauce is good - not great. I love the sausage, making a simple sausage pizza magnificent.  Pasta Louie (cajun alfredo) is great. Nice and spicy.  Spaghetti pie is great. It has green peppers, so beware if you don't care for them. Otherwise, great.  Fish Fry is first rate. Usually several choices - blue gill, cod, perch, etc.  Thursday night the ribs are awesome. Falling off the bone tasty. Go early, because when they sell out, they are done.  Good prices. Not the lowest in town, but fair.  People always really nice.  Local restaurant. not a bland chain.  Down side to Angelos:  If it's busy, they can be slow. Staff is nice, but sometimes they are just overwhelmed.   Old facility - including stinky old bathrooms.   Not a lot of seating, so if you come at the wrong time, you might have to wait."}
{"text":"If you want to go and get harassed by the regular that goes there everyday,  this is it! Not, only, that but having the bartender support  him, telling you to get the \"f\" out of hid seat! Patti( the bartender)  continued to serve the man alcohol even after he appeared to have had a few before coming out! I tried calling the owner who i never ended up hearing from. I will let everyone know about my horrible experience I had, considering I live in monona!"}
{"text":"New to the community, we were hoping to find a nice, local restaurant ... Enter Angelo's. As luck would have it, our server was April ... Yes, THE April (see other reviews)!  We decided on the specials (ribs/salmon) and we were not disappointed. We will start testing the menu next visit. From our vantage point we could see that they do a pretty brisk pizza take out business, too! Safe to take anyone there, comfortably casual."}
{"text":"Dan is the best bartender EVER! We are sitting at a table and yet he is attentive to us!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"We moved to Monona in 2012 and after trying a few of the local pizza places that came recommended, this has become one of our favorites in Madison.  It's not as good as Ian's, but it's damned good, solid pizza.  Angelo's is owned by the same family that owns Fraboni's, so expect the same kind of flavors.  Kitchy place, nice service, avoid Friday nights and Packer games, you'll never get a seat."}
{"text":"A group of us went here a few weeks ago on A Friday, and had a really great experience!  We got there a little before a normal dinner rush on a Friday, about 4:30 p.m., and boy am I glad we got here early!  You walk in to a small bar space, and right through there is an intimate dining room.  There were spots to choose from when we got there, but there had to already be a wait by the time we were leaving an hour later!  We enjoyed their Friday night Fish Fry - I had the cod, and it was great.  My brother and husband went with their special, the grouper.  My husband was SO EXCITED they had grouper!  We had just gotten back from FL recently, and he was so bummed he didn't have any while down there.  It was really, really good.  The staff was super attentive.  Our waitress regularly checked in along with two other women (it probably didn't hurt we had a flirty baby with us LOL).  They were so warm and welcoming that I knew right away we'd be going back.  One woman let us know that their head chef is previously from Jolly Bob's, and they've been really featuring some of his specialties by rotating them out as specials every Friday!  There was a shrimp dish I have to go back and try...and I'd tell you all about it if I had just written this when I got home!  Whoops.  Anyways, they also have a rewards club that we were happy to sign up for, and we just received a coupon in the mail for a free pizza - awesome deals AND amazing service, they pretty much won over my heart right away.  I'd highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great little Italian bar/restaurant!  I had the Pasta Primavera with chicken. It was really delicious. We got in quickly on a busy Saturday night. Friendly waitress. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is our 2nd visit, this week!! Just for fun, The Husband got Hamm's ala childhood memory of his Grandfather  Our 1st visit was Lasagna for me, soooo good, & Alfredo Spaghetti Pie for him. He tried my lasagna's marina & wants that on his Spaghetti Pie next time. The owner's daughter/manager stopped by to welcome us & all the staff was charming from hostess on. Tonight we're trying pizza, smelled good as a To Go pie walked by in the parking lot, ha!"}
{"text":"We had an impromptu get together and they were able to accommodate us within a relatively short time.  The staff was very friendly and our waitress was very attentive.  We started our evening meal with appetizers: jalapeno poppers, sweet potato fries, spinach and artichoke dip, cheese curds and a sampler platter.  The jalapeno poppers were tasteless, but the rest of the appetizers were good, especially the spinach and artichoke dip.  The only caveat was the appetizers were served at the same time our soup and salad arrived.   It took some time afterwards before we were served our main meal.  However, not all of us were served our main meal at the same time, and those of us that were left waiting were finally served just as everyone else was finishing up their meal.  Half of us thought our main dishes were bland: shrimp scampi, lasagna, and pasta louie.  The lasagna serving was small for the price.   The marinara sauce was very bland with no zest, and tasted like a can of semi-pureed fresh tomatoes with a few pieces of tomato mixed in.  The description of lasagna states it is loaded with mozzarella, ricotta and parmesan cheese, which was not the case.  There did not appear to be any ricotta in the dish, as well as a limited amount of mozzarella cheese, but it was loaded with meat.  If I could rate the wait staff separately I would give them five stars.  My rating reflects the food only."}
{"text":"What a great place!  Party of four and each entree was exceptional.  Service was pleasant and welcoming.  It's a small quaint place and I will definitely come back.  You can't go wrong with any pasta dish."}
{"text":"The portabella ravioli is sooo delicious.  My friends had lasagna and primavera and they raved about them as well.  Really great place for italian."}
{"text":"April is a WONDERFUL server!  She is so welcoming and knowledgable with the menu.  We will definitely come back and asked to be sat in her section.  This is the second time I've had her as a server, and both times were phenomenal.  Great pepperoni sliders, white pizza and pasta."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and consistently good food. Sausage sliders with soup is one of my favorite meals. Staff and bartender always ask how our meal was and often they ask for suggestions on how to make things better.  Quite a change from chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Good Italian food and pizza. Not inexpensive, but worth it. Try the cheesy bread, it's fantastic."}
{"text":"At least for now, I'm not writing up anyplace unless I consider it a favorite and can give it 5 stars.  Angelo's is no exception.  Family owned sit down Italian restaurant with some American/Midwestern twists.  I LOVE the specialty pastas.  There are a few cajun influenced, several seafood, and others.  Among my favorites:  The Penne Bleu and the Cardiac Louie.  I've also had several of the more conventional Italian dishes and found them exceptional as well.  I have never had the pizza, but I have heard good things.  Really I cant recall having ever been disappointed by any menu item.  Appetizer sampler consists only of bread, but it's such good bread.    When I used to go at least once a month, the wait staff knew me by name and remember which table I liked, what I typically ordered, etc.  My wife and I decided to have our wedding dinner here, and they were extremely accomodating, even opening on a date and time they would normally be closed.  I dont think they even charged us more than what the food would have normally cost.  We had a rather raucous group of people and filled the lower level, they were extremely welcoming and gave us great service.  Only notes I'd make:  It's not super formal or upscale, there is a bar adjacent to the dining room where sporting events are watched with enthusiasm.  It's pricier than, say, Olive Garden (but not by much and well worth it).  They're not open for lunch.  And if you come during a \"special\" (e.g. Friday Night Fish Fry, remember I said there were some Midwestern twists) they dont always serve the regular menu.  I would pick Angelo's over any other sit down Italian place in the area.  I hope you do, too."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly, the salad and pasta were fresh and delicious with good-sized portions, and the atmosphere nice. My only tiny complaint: I would prefer hearing music in the bar area rather than hearing the TV...it was rather awkward to sit in there while we waited to eat."}
{"text":"Food was great,fast, and staff was friendly.  Even got us food not on the menu cause it was fish fry Friday.  Would go there again if we lived closer! The Cajun shrimp app was delish and our waitress was beyond helpful"}
{"text":"This is a review on their catering service.   Angelo's catered an event we went to and we were looking forward to a really good meal.  It wasn't Italian food so maybe this was part of the problem but the food was a big disappointment for what we had to pay and there was very little help with the service.  A few of the items were pretty good in flavor but overall it was a lackluster  meal."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Angelo's for as long as I can remember. They have the best pizza I have ever tasted and the wait staff knows our family and is always super kind as well as attentive. (Apparently?) they don't take reservations, so there may be a bit of a wait, but it is SO TOTALLY WORTH IT and if you're in a rush I'm sure you can call ahead so they put your name on the list if you're planning on going on a weekend night. I have never found a pizza to match theirs and have been all over the world. Their speghetti is AMAZING and I have a soft spot for their garlic bread and breadsticks. I'm a huge fan of their house salad with sun-dried tomato dressing. My family always gets the Vegetarian special, with no onions, no artichokes, add sausage. The angelo's special is pretty good too. They don't make their stuffed (deepizza anymore, which"}
{"text":"Service was really good; we had a fourth person join late and our waitress rushed out his order fast enough to still eat with us. The small salad came quick.  The sampler platter of bread was hot and fresh. The lasagna was excellent, and came with different bread than the sampler platter. All in all, nothing to complain about, and was very delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, also had sampler platter and the sauce was excellent, the pizza could have used a bit more sauce, but still great. Friday night crowded, but it's a small place. Staff was friendly and apologized for wait. Had our two-year old with us and they brought him a little bag of goldfish during our wait time. Love the loyalty program, definitely can't be beat! Only thing I noticed is that the online menu didn't match the menu in the restaurant.... Kind of a bummer since the pasta online sounded very good, not as many choices in person.... That's the only reason for the 4/5 rating."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Friday night. Very busy but very small dining area. They offered us to wait or we could eat in the bar. We chose to eat in the bar. The staff was very friendly and very attentive even though they were busy. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The chicken ranch pizza was very good with a Flavorful white sauce. The crust was okay but not amazing. The sauce on the meat lovers was bland but they are very generous with the  toppings.  Also appreciated that the cheese blend contained cheddar."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST dining experience of my life!  Some time ago, I ordered four pizzas from Angelo's for pick up. They were made incorrectly and tasted HORRIBLE, like tomato paste on stale crackers. I called and was told they would remake the pizzas but since I do not live near the restaurant I could do call in to have them made on another occasion.   I forgot about the pizzas for awhile, then remembered and decided to call in and order them. They apparently had not taken down did my information and when I was transferred to the owner, he told me that I was lying, \"this is not how we do things,\" and told me to call and scam some other restaurant. After berating each other (yes, I partook, appalled) he took my address and told me he'd send me a twenty dollar gift certificate for another restaurant so that he'd never have to deal with me again.   This is probably the ideal resolution to this situation given the revolting nature of the small amount of their food that I've experienced (like, barely edible) but I am still shell-shocked at how this man treated me. I am truly surprised this establishment has been able to stay in business.   ps I downloaded Yelp just so I could leave this review and will now promptly delete it as I don't typically have problems like this. Such an a-hole!"}
{"text":"My parents had their rehearsal dinner at Angelo's on Monona Drive 50 years ago and to this day are regular patrons both at the McFarland and Monona locations. They really wanted to have their 50th anniversary (party of 13) at the Monona location. With kids (one baby) there really wasn't a way we could do it without a reservation. I know that they don't take reservations but thought in this case they might make an exception. Apparently I was wrong. The woman told me that just by asking I was \"putting her in a tough position\" and that she couldn't make \"any exceptions.\" Sorry, Angelo's, my parents might be back but the rest of us don't have time for a supposed \"family\" restaurant that doesn't have time to honor customers who have stuck with you for over half a century. The restaurant biz in Madison is booming and there are dozens of other places I'd rather eat anyway. You just lost the next generation of customers. Talk about failing customer service 101!!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't happy made a special trip there for the family on s Friday night. They ran out of baked potatoes and hash brown casserole. It wasn't even late. Family was not happy they wanted the casserole that is why they came for the fish. Wasted night"}
{"text":"Had a craving for ravioli and decided to give Angelo's a try for a to-go order. I've been before, but it has been a few years. The bread was first rate--at first I was worried, but it was fresh with a think chewy crust and soft interior. I had the portabella ravioli--I assumed they would be filled with the mushroom/cheese mix, but it was the plain raviolis with fresh sauteed mushrooms on top. Still good. Sauce was delicious--seemed fresh homemade, thick with chunks of tomato. The layer of fresh parm cheese on top added nice flavor.The ravioli itself was nothing special, but the rest was perfect. Could have used more spice, but overall, it was very satisfying."}
{"text":"Small, cozy place with awesome food. We had the sampler breads along with  Alfredo ravioli with portobello mushrooms!! It was delicious and on point. This place did not disappoint us at all although we randomly picked up this restaurant to try!!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo overpriced for what it is. Mediocre and lacking seasoning. I got the chicken pesto pasta which was decent however I believe the chicken was frozen and it lacked flavor. $16 for that... crazy! Not worth the price at all.  I won't get food from here ever again."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Awesome drinks in a tiny little place. I don't know, but I wouldn't be shocked if this is a scratch kitchen. Had coconut shrimp, lasagna and pizza within our party and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza!!!!! Love their specialty pies, often get the Greek with sausage or ham. Had dinner here once and was not impressed with the pasta, the sauce was too sweet and most egregious of all-- noodles overcooked! Big no no. Might try again, but for now we will stick with the pizzas. Just wish they offered bigger than their large!(which only feeds two hungry adults in our experience)"}
{"text":"Cheerful, friendly neighborhood red sauce place in McFarland. The house sangria is delicious and huge. The pastas were tasty. We didn't have the pizza, but it looked really good. There's nothing trendy or healthy going on here, but that's OK. Prices are reasonable.Lots of staff and attentive service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The chicken parmigiana was OK in its cooking execution, and the sauce was good. It was served with linguine, which is kind of odd. But really my issue is that for $15, I would think that the chicken could have been a real breast, instead of a processed, sponge-like chunk of \"meat\" like you would find in the frozen food section or at a fast food joint. And after glancing at other reviews just now, I'm not the only one who isn't fond of the oversized chicken nugget with mozzarella on top!"}
{"text":"This is probably our FAVORITE local restaurant!! Several of the pasta dishes are to die for!! Good choice of wines. Owners are fabulous people!! They have a lovely outdoor patio. The ambiance inside is warm and inviting. Highly recommend it and ask for April. She's a honey!!"}
{"text":"This place I thought was way overhyped on google reviews. Let me be clear, this isn't really an authentic Italian restaurant, but more like the comforting midwestern Italian style restaurant. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but just know that going in.   The prices are decent for the food you get. The food in itself is pretty good, but nothing crazy. We had the Cajun fettuccine, which I thought was pretty tasty and also the pesto chicken alfredo. I thought the pesto tasted great, but the chicken was super bland.   Another perk, for a glass of wine you get probably the equivalent of 2-3 glasses of wine. So that was great!"}
{"text":"I asked the kid for red pepper flakes and garlic powder but I got grated cheese and oregano I asked at the Pizza be cooked well done but it wasn't and it also didn't have enough sauce on it the rest of the mail wasn't any good either"}
{"text":"Great little place!  Service is friendly, food is great.  The pizza here, while not the same as Chicago, is probably the best in Madison.  We just had our 4 year old's birthday party here, wanting to support a local place with decent food rather than a Chuck E. Cheese. We were astounded at what a nice job they did for our daughter. They were so accommodating with everything, even assigning a member of the staff to our small party. The kids had a wonderful time. Absolutely thrilled."}
