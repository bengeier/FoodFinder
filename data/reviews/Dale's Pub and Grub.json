{"text":"Went to Dales Pub and Grub for Lunch had the perch sandwich was not impressed. Two small pieces of perch on top of a huge Kaiser type bun. Had three bites all had bones. Very disappointing. Coleslaw was good. Going to give them one more try with the pizza next week. Bar food type menu"}
{"text":"PLEASE check your receipt and compare it to the bank charge. I always tip in cash and write \"cash\" on the tip line and they added $5.00 to my charge AFTER I signed for it. Came thru my bank 2 days later with the extra $5.00 on it. May not seem like much but if they do it to everyone they get a lot of money! Considering filing a police report for fraud!"}
{"text":"They've really done a nice job turning this cozy little place around (the hold Hankos then Ginn Mill)So far the food we've tried from here has been really good. We've tried the wings on wing night (Thursday) and they were cooked perfectly with great flavor. At .59 a wing you can't beat it! The pizza is also very good. The crust is just a little crispy so when you pick up your pizza it doesn't fold in half and all the toppings fall off. Good amount of cheese and plenty of toppings. We ordered a large 3 topping for 13.99, well worth it. The chicken paprikas soup is really good too, we got a cup to go but I believe on Tuesday you can get it on a bread bowl. Each day they have different specials, Monday I don't remember, Tuesday Paprikas, Wednesday stuffed peppers or cabbage, Thursday wings, Friday Perch and Saturday Prime Rib for 14.99, I think it's 10oz. Severs are friendly, the owner interacts with everyone and makes sure everything is up to par. Good music, clean, great prices and friendly staff, you can't beat it!"}
