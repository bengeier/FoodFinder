{"text":"Great coffee shop in the heart of Independence. Staff was extremely helpful and kind. The latte was very good. Food was great too, I ordered the egg muffin with guac and salsa which was a nice healthy start to the morning.  Keep it local and try Babe's !"}
{"text":"Great spot for a cup of coffee and very friendly service! I haven't been in for a bite to eat but I've heard the food is very good as well. This is a great spot to meet a friend or client for a cup of coffee. Support your local small businesses!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, great food, very friendly staff and owner. Highly recommend supporting this family owned business! Thanks Meg for the  recommendation."}
{"text":"Great local find!  I was in the area and like to \"keep it local\" when searching for a quick bite.  The atmosphere is inviting and comfortable, service was above and beyond by owner, and price was very reasonable.  Enjoyed delicious egg salad sandwich on ciabatta bread, came with fresh slice of watermelon.  Also indulged in a sweet treat offered by Cocoa Joe's (a local entrepreneurial chocolate company).  They offer homemade pastries, small menu of breakfast and sandwiches, specialty coffee and teas.  Try them out."}
{"text":"Great staff, clean, well designed and executed.  Its not crowded, they play decent music and my buddy loves the multigrain roles.  The only downside is for carnivores  - they don't do meat which I like with my breakfast.  I guess you can't have everything!"}
{"text":"This a fantastic breakfast place. The breakfast wrap, bagel with homemade peanut butter, parfait and chai were awesome. The people are super friendly and efficient with quick service. Well deserved rating."}
{"text":"Babe's Cafe & Bakery is simply Devine.  The clean & stylish decor is very inviting. Babe greeted me personally after I mentioned I found them on Google maps. As an employee of a small business, I understand the importance of feedback from advertising investments. I enjoyed the hot vegetable sandwich on warmed ciabotta bread. The hot Machan tea was a nice comforting beverage as I sat and enjoyed reading a book.  If it wasn't an hour away from me, I would be here at least twice a week! You have a great business here Babe, and it's your friendly personality that makes it so great!!! Thank you!! ~Aimee @ Wooster Floral - 330-264-9630"}
{"text":"I'd made a handful of visits to Brielle's (the previous establishment in this location), and was never much of a fan.  The new owne's have completely redecorated the interior, and it feels much more welcoming and comfortable now.  There is bar seating against the wall and front window, several tables, and some comfy chairs and couches in the back.  If only this place were open on Sundays, it would be exactly the kind of place you could sit for a couple hours and read the paper.

They have a larger selection of pastries than I remember from before (maybe a half dozen varieties of muffins, donuts, and more).  We tried a few with mixed results. The cornbread jalapeno muffin was good, but the apple fritter and tea biscuit were meh.  They have a menu of breakfast foods (sandwiches, wraps, etc.), but it looked a bit expensive to me ($6+ for an avocado egg sandwich with no sides).

The service was great and the people working were very patient and friendly.

I wish they had cold coffee drinks.  I asked about the \"seasonal signature\" drink on the menu, and was told they'd make \"whatever I want.\" So maybe they have some, but there were no iced or cold brewed or frozen drinks listed."}
{"text":"It's tasty, it's cozy, and everyone is friendly. Breakfast wraps are delicious and they'll keep your coffee hot. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Love BABE'S  Stop in every time I visit Ohio from California! Again and Again, Wondeful Staff , Atmosphere, Food & Drinks! 
Love visiting my Aunt and Cleveland Family ; and we all enjoy BABE'S! 
Thanks for the Memories & Good times !

{"text":"Oh my gosh!! I was looking for coffee and a place reminiscent of my Seattle. Babes is that except the hospitality is 10 times better. The coffee is fresh full flavored and downright delicious. I've found my coffee home away from home!! Thanks Babes!!"}
{"text":"This is a really friendly place.  Had morning coffee and a muffin.  Both were great.   The atmosphere and the genuine friendliness are really nice and not in an over the top way.   Definitely planning to try lunch.   I don't drink as much coffee any more but there are lots of other choices.  Give it a try"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I couldn't have been more impressed.  The egg bake was delicious and the coffee was so flavorful.  Will definitely be returning in the near future!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure their egg scramble gave me food poisoning."}
{"text":"Love all the new improvements!!! I always just ordered and left. They updated all the seating, which is much more comfortable.  The iced coffee  and jalapeño cheddar cornbread muffins were amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Cute decor, very clean, and friendly service!  Bakery and food is always fresh.  Great coffee selection. Perfect place to start your day or meet up with friends or family. Definitely would recommend this café!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this business while making a trip to the post office and in need of a coffee fix. I was impressed with the interior, very comfortable sitting areas, tables, chairs, and a tv sitting area in the back. This would be ideal for a small study group, book club, or just a spot to meet up. The coffee was decent. It wasn't gas station coffee or watered down, rancid goo in a cup. They had a choice of three flavors and a coffee station for your own add-ins. A 16 oz cup was decently priced. They also offered a limited breakfast menu. I enjoyed a toasted bagel with cream cheese. It was nicely wrapped in foil and still warm after a 15 min drive to my office. I also tried an apple turnover from their bakery choices. Delicious and worth the price. As far as cafes go, this was not bad. A good alternative if you're seeking something new or different. For the three items I purchased, I spent less than $6 which was fine with me. I'll have to make this a new place to visit."}
{"text":"- I went in there a week or so ago. 
- Thought it was a very comfy atmosphere; Very clean. 
- I would definitely go back, more for a coffee and bakery snack place to meet a friend on a day off. 
- People were very nice and very helpful. 
- Best coffee in town? I'm not sure about that, I'd have to try more to validate that, but it was good. 
- It wouldn't be a place for me to get a breakfast on a regular basis. Bakery though, YES. 
- I truly do hope they stay around for a long time; always good to have a coffee shop & bakery place around town. 
- If they were open on nights, I'd totally go there more often instead of Panera."}
{"text":"My colleagues and I LOVE Babe's -- she's really turned this spot around after taking over the space! The cafe itself has such a homey feel, and the staff is always friendly and helpful.

As for the food, Babe has put great care into creating a healthy menu of tasty options. Our group often goes for the Pick-Two Combo at lunch, where you can get a cup of fresh soup of the day or salad with a half sandwich on ciabatta. But I also like to indulge in the PB&J, which comes with amazing freshly-ground peanut butter and jelly (or hot pepper jelly if you're adventurous)! And every now and again, the quiche.

Babe's also has a great selection of pastries -- I've never tried a muffin there that I didn't like! -- as well as coffees and teas. The white chocolate mocha is my favorite go-to.

Need a recommendation? Just ask Babe herself! She's almost always there working, and is never too busy to say hello and give suggestions. Her passion for her cafe and clients is clear every time we visit.

Overall, I highly recommend supporting this locally-owned small business! It's a great place to meet friends or co-workers for breakfast or lunch, grab a coffee and pastry on the go, or even eat solo while working over wi-fi."}
{"text":"Babe's is a local gem!  Welcoming atmosphere, wonderful bakery (!) and Babe & her team are awesome - efficient, fun and engaging, and smart.  The sandwiches and soups - fresh and delish."}
{"text":"After spending all morning at nearby St. Vincent Charity Medical Center, I was so excited to find Babe's as being nearby on my Yelp app.

I am a huge sucker for small, family owned businesses. I love locally owned spots where the names of their family members are all over the walls and menus, where the seating makes you want to stay all day and they know their customers by name. Your GPS will guide you into a somewhat confusing plaza; so don't miss Babe's tucked right near the CVS.

After a long morning, I'm sure I was super grumpy, and the gals working were very helpful and patient. They walked me through the menu, and I ordered the breakfast scramble wrap with guacamole/salsa (at the gal's suggestion) and a vanilla chai. My chai totally hit the spot. The wrap was also yummy, but I wished I had gone sans-guacamole/salsa. By the time I got home, it was pretty mushy wet on the bottom. But that's my fault for ordering it, not there's. My wrap also came with a side of a watermelon slice-- how cute is that?!

I wish I could've stayed longer. The vibe is friendly and homey. This would be a perfect place for breakfast or lunch with friends, or to come and do work. Oh, and holy moly, the bakery/pastry selection was to-die for. Donuts, bear claws, croissants, and so much more ooey gooey chocolate goodness was behind that glass. Babe's is absolutely worth the visit! I will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop tucked away in Independence. They have coffee with vegan milk options and tasty pastries."}
{"text":"Good espresso, very friendly staff. Breakfast food choices here are much better than Starbucks or Dunkin. The chairs are surprisingly comfortable which maybe seems unimportant, but when you have 2 hours of work to do, it really matters.

You have to ask for the WiFi info, but it works ok.

Plenty of easily accessible parking."}
{"text":"Amazing home away from home.... super friendly owner serving amazing coffee and excellent muffins!"}
{"text":"What a cute place! From the outside it is hard to tell how lovely it is, but as soon as you step in it is absolutely adorable! They have very warm, friendly staff and use locally produced ingredients. My husband and I ordered their quiche and their breakfast wrap! Both were amazing!!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes, Babe got this place all right!!! First of all, the place is absolutely adorable. Very welcoming and comfortable, while trendy and fun! I started with an iced latte. They used coffee ice cubes so I fell in love instantly, plus the flavor was on point. It came out in a mason jar which I also thought was super cute. They have a small menu but I thought was the perfect size and a decent amount of bakery. I ordered the egg salad sandwich and added guacamole! Wow!! I could barely speak to my friend while I devoured the sandwich and made a huge mess but, could care less because I couldn't get enough of this sandwich. It was light, fresh and the flavor was just right! I don't usually like to get stuff I could make, but they showed me up for sure! I didn't try any bakery but, I know I'll be back so I look forward to trying something else. Lastly, and one of the most important parts to a five star review, the customer service was outstanding. The young lady behind the counter was friendly, helpful and just made you feel like all you need to do is relax and she's got the rest. We spoke with the owner, Babe briefly before we left and she was also very friendly and you could tell she has a very positive influence in her clientele. You can also rent this gem out for small parties, so now I'm fast thinking of a need to have an event, no matter why you stop, this is a must to check out."}
{"text":"I know my cookies. I'm not a vegan. Babe's cookies are the best and the vegan ones will blow you away. I had no idea they were vegan, I just knew they were the best I'd ever had. 

Babe and her team are awesome. Fun, funny, and smart. Customer service is A+. Everything they sell is delicious, including breakfast, myriad coffees brewed cold and hot, plus a large array of beans for sale as well. Décor is great with plenty of seating options between the bar rail, tables, and comfy couches and chairs in the back.

Love this place."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this little coffee shop while meeting with a colleague. VERY friendly staff! Tasty coffee and breakfast burrito.

Wish this place was in a more frequent routine."}
{"text":"I stopped by here to pick up the homemade cookies - amazing! I also had the egg bake, which is the perfect breakfast; baked eggs and cheese with yummy ham. Definitely get the accompanying spinach, sweet corn salsa and guacamole...only 50 cents extra and totally enhances the dish. The restaurant area is nice and relaxing, which I appreciated after walking 15 minutes from my mechanic's."}
{"text":"Adorable people and place! Went for lunch with a friend and had a great lunch. I had the soup and sandwich combo, 1/2 tuna sandwich and soup of the day. It was so filling, and deliciously fresh plus they make their iced coffee with coffee ice cubes!!! One of the best cups of coffee I have had in a long time. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Friendly service and a fun environment. Limited menu but delicious options. I disagree with the other reviews complaining about the menu options. If you are in the market for a meat filled sandwich, there's a subway across the street or even a few Delis in the same plaza as Babe's. I agree that the bakery is Babe's strong suit though, there's always a huge variety of tasty treats available. Also, there's a good variety of coffee drinks available too. This is a local favorite now and I would highly recommend to anyone looking for some healthier lunch options, coffee, or some treats. I have stopped in several times for breakfast and lunch and have consistently enjoyed my order."}
{"text":"Long story short. My wife and I went here for breakfast. Repeat breakfast. I was in the mood for eggs sunny side up, hash browns, and either sausage, ham, or bacon. Nothing out of the ordinary right? None of that is available here. What breakfast joint doesn't serve this? We left."}
{"text":"I intended to go to Brielle's for a quick espresso and was surprised to see that it's now Babe's! I was informed by the woman who helped me that it had been under new management for about six weeks at the time of my visit. The service was friendly and there were quite a few customers hanging out at 10:30 in the morning. 

The interior has been completely redecorated. Long gone are the hand-painted murals and wrought iron tables. The cafe now has a newer, modern feel with plenty of space to sit and work or catch up with friends. The display case featured some tasty-looking treats, but I was really only in the shop for a caffeine fix. I ordered a double espresso. It was just okay...no crema, nondescript flavor, nothing remarkable. This would be a good place to meet up with someone, but perhaps not the best place for a properly made espresso."}
