{"text":"I had the Buddha Bowl and it was really nice. I like the poke bowl idea because it has veggies, carb and protein all in one. The place is quite small but it has lots of seating space outside. Would be nice if they can put a few tables in the mall area."}
{"text":"I love this place! Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, big portion, and you can customize everything."}
{"text":"The best poke bowl I've eaten! It was so good and fresh, I finished it so fast !! I had the regular sized custom bowl - which had salmon, corn, white rice. Really tasty and fresh, good portions for the price you're paying. Easily accessible by transit ( just outside Shepard and Yonge subway station), and very clean inside.  Definitely the best and my favourite place for poke in Toronto, and I've been to many. Will come again to try more! :)"}
{"text":"First time trying a Poke bowl, and was not disappointed. Tried the \"It's Lit\" and it was pretty good. Finished the bowl but was underwhelmed by the size, left my stomach slightly unsatisfied for the price point.   Cute space, but not to many seats. Great place for a pick up and go."}
{"text":"Salmon, tuna, kale, North York. Poke Eats has taking a love of these ingredients to a whole new level. I have tried a few poke restaurants before, but Poke Eats' combination is by far the most delicious. All the options are simple and each ingredient compliments each other other very well. I will recommend the owner to bring it to the EAST end.  p.s. make sure to get extra nori"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  For poke restaurants in a Toronto this is pretty good. Fair price and they allow for a lot of customization. Wish there was more fish in the bowl but this is a common issue for these  restaurants in Toronto.  They have a loyalty card that they stamp that lets you earn a free bowl if you eat there often enough. Would eat again if in area.   Food tried: PokeEats signature bowl It's Lit signature bowl  Service: Efficient and quick"}
{"text":"I always love visiting Poke Eats! I stop by a couple times a month and each time the food is delicious. The shop is small, definitely a take away, but they are efficient and the sushi is a great quality. I have tried a couple other poke shops downtown and definitely prefer this one!"}
{"text":"Overall: 5.0 stars  Food: Ahh, so excited for this review!! This was my first poke bowl and I was not disappointed at all! So glad to have some POKE EATS in the neighbourhood! I had the \"It's Lit\" bowl. It was a delicious medley of flavours. It had black sushi rice, salmon, spicy mayo, avocado, spicy cucumber and cherry tomato. The ingredients were very fresh. I love the black sushi rice, although if you're only used to plain white rice, I might see this as a bit of a change. The spicy salmon was very good and balanced flavour. The cherry tomatoes had a refreshing burst and tasted exactly like a tomato should (not watered down). I liked how I could move around to different parts of the bowl and enjoy different flavours.  Service: I was taken care of by a friendly front staff. The owner greeted me and was very kind. The restaurant is very clean and modern. There is a bit of limited seating, but I imagine most people are grabbing take out.   Parking: There's underground paid parking or paid street parking. I got lucky with parking, but it could be difficult during busy hours. I'll have to experiment with other parking options as I come here more.   Overall Impressions: Delicious and experience was worthwhile.  I know the price point is slightly higher, but you can taste the quality of the ingredients and quality comes at a price (i.e avoiding frozen ingredients).  I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu! Especially the \"BYOB - Build Your Own Bowl\"!!"}
{"text":"What a simple set up. The place might be tiny but it carries a big punch when it comes to quality of its Poke Bowls. The owner is a young entrepreneur with a great personality. I am so glad my wife and searched out a poke bowl restaurant. The quality of the fish and the way they take their time to marinate your fish and sides is awesome. Definitely a must go if you like you want a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Great Poke experience in North York. I love the black rice ! The fish is fresh, flavourful and a great compliment to the numerous toppings that is offer. Good portion for the price and I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Love this place!   I like how they serve the purple rice instead of the brown rice you find at other poke places. It's really small so you can't really eat there but it is connected to a plaza that has plenty of space for you to sit.   I had the snack size and I was still full! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"One word: YOM! Wasn't sure if is place would cater to vegetarians but was pleased to see they take a custom approach to their bowls! I had the 'lit' with tofu - highly recommend it! Don't want a full bowl? They do snack sizes! Service was friendly and quick"}
{"text":"Came here at 12 or so - it was just in the nick of lunch rush. It took a while for the line to get moving - there was about 5 people in front of us and a 10 minute wait to get to the cashier. The service was ok but clearly it was a time-orientated rather than service-orientated. The restaurant itself is small so there was only a bench table with 4 chairs so most orders had to be to-go.   I had the \"It's lit\" poke bowl with black rice, spicy mayo, salmon, corn. One thing I loved was that the black rice was truly black rice - so many times restaurant claims that it they serve \"black rice\" but it was really a mixture. I enjoyed the fish and the spicy mayo - wasn't too much. The corn added a strange taste to it. I'd come back but service needs to be better."}
{"text":"I've only tried a few places for poke bowls but I would say Poke Eats is the best so far. I always get salmon anywhere I go and i've noticed other places always give so little. So compared to others, they are generous on their toppings.  I got their regular sized bowl for $10.99 and I could barely finish it. They also have snack sizes for $6.99, which is what I should get next time.   My new go-to for poke bowls.  Reasonable price, good portions and close by."}
{"text":"The fish was fresh, the bowl was good and fairly priced. I'd visit again but I'd go for the unagi sauce next time if I'm ever in the area. TBH I've had better poke bowls, but not in the area.   I got their signature poke eats bowl. I also got extra protein, 15.99 for a large bowl of raw tuna is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Brand new poke place located by the green condo building in North York. It is a convenient accessible location along the subway line. If you are travelling by car, it might be a bit difficult to find parking.   It was my first visit here and I tried one of their signature bowl \" It's lit\". It came with black sushi rice, salmon, spicy mayo, avocado, spicy cucumbers, and cherry tomatoes. This bowl was also garnished with ginger, scallions, nori, radish, fried onions, and sesame seeds. Overall taste was yummy as I am a fan of anything Jap. Portion was good and definitely a healthy alternative. The only thing I thought can be better was probably more sauce for the rice maybe because the texture of black grains are generally harder so may taste a bit dry if there wasn't enough sauce.   Moreover, this is a small place so if you plan to eat in, there are only a few seating because it is mainly meant for takeouts. I like how they give out a stamp card; for every 8 bowls, you can redeem 1 free one.  I also had the chance to speak to the owner and picked his brain in regards to his business in the food industry. Very nice humble human being! Will definitely be back to try the other poke bowls. Thank you for the great experience!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite poke place in the city. Great value and love how you're able to build your own bowl to suit your own tastes. The place is always spotless with nice modern decor. The fish is always fresh. Gotta try the black sushi rice!"}
{"text":"I love a good poke.  Poke Eats is in a building which doesn't have its own parking, so you will have to find street parking.  It's strictly a take-out place as there are only a few chairs along the wall for you to eat.  However, in the same building further down there is a tiny food court with plenty of seating, so we found that we could take our poke bowls and eat there comfortably.  Ingredients are quite fresh and has a few customization options.  However, I do find that their portions are small, and in particular the fish/rice ratio is a bit small - you do end up finishing your fish much earlier than the rest of your meal.  I suppose this is a trade off for having fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I come here a lot for a quick dinner when I don't feel like cooking. The workers are pretty friendly and the food quality is good.   I got the poke eats (tuna) and my girlfriend got the lit (salmon). My girlfriend doesn't like their spicy cucumber, which comes with the lit, but they let you substitute (she got the crab salad instead).   They also take credit cards (AmEx included), and Apple Pay."}
{"text":"Not the best poke I had in Toronto, it is actually rated one of the worst I had.  Size is small and they put a lot of soy sauce at the bottom so when I was eating the rice it is super salty and not edible.  Also they don't have too much topping compare to other places. The fish was quite fresh but that is all good about Poke Eats."}
{"text":"Location/Service Yonge/Sheppard intersection. Parking can be a little tricky - street and lot are available if you search around. The restaurant is located on the ground floor of a newly build apartment/mall complex. There is a direct TTC subway access to the complex - so very convenient.  The restaurant is relatively small, suiting more on the to-go/quick convenient style. Love the decor inside, which is bright, simple designs and high ceilings. Staff are nice with good service.  Food For those who are not familiar, poke bowls are raw fish mixed with veggies/sauce on top of a bed of rice. It's an excellent option if you like to eat healthy and get most of your food groups in one meal.  Poke Eats offer 2 options to choose from - build your own bowl or signature bowl. I built my own and I chose black sushi rice topped with maguro (tuna), spicy mayo, seaweed salad, avacado, spicy cucumber and all garnishes. Everything went so well together and I liked how it was freshly made right in front of you. With building your own, it's pretty much anything you want - and they offer a variety of ingredients like salmon, white tuna, bean curd, mango, crab salad, corn and edamame.  This is definitely a go-to place if you want an easy convenient healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"My first time having Poke. Its a good alternative to sushi. I ordered a custom bowl with white rice, salmon, avacado,cucumber,ginger and all the fixings.   The servers are friendly and the store is bright and clean.   Only con would be the serving size being a little small for their largest bowl size."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick lunch with a friend. This was my first time trying poke and i wasn't disappointed. I agree with many other reviews I've read about this trendy new food and it's like a bowl of deconstructed sushi with many flavours! I really enjoy being able to switch between pallet cleansers like fresh ginger and cucumber (done very similar to oi kimchi) to the fish and rice to get that flavour burst of the spicy mayo. The meal was excellent, filling and felt clean and healthy. The place has a very clean look with hip uniforms and friendly staff. Not much space for seating maybe 3 seats but a great place to stop by for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"this place has the freshest fish! i'd recommend building your own bowl, but the staff is super friendly"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The owner is super nice, and the staff as well. They are very knowledgeable and courteous when helping you build your bowl to your specific tastes.  Location is great too, right next to SW TTC entrance at Yonge and Sheppard. Space is really clean and has a great aesthetic with the white finishes throughout.  If you're looking for something healthy and tasty as hell, you've found the right place!"}
{"text":"It was amazing. Brought my boyfriend yesterday and my friend today. I tried the Poke Bowl and the It's Lit bowl and loved both. For the It's Lit bowl, I added crab meat salad and pineapple, and subbed the spicy cucumber with mangos for a sweet and spicy combo. It was super good hehe, the only issue is there's not much space to sit inside. There is seating outside though! But no tables unfortunately, so you'll end up eating with the bowl on your lap hehe. Regardless, definitely coming back to try other bowls."}
{"text":"If you're weight conscious and counting your calories, this place is great because the portion size is a joke. When I asked for cherry tomatoes, they would only add 3 slices. No more no less. If Rolltation happened to open up next door this place would be gone in a month."}
{"text":"Great place to get Poke Bowl. Convenient to get to as it is right on the subway line, but little challenging to get parking.  Overall great experience and the food was tasty and filling."}
{"text":"Im slowly trying all the poke places in Toronto to get a good idea of whats out there. This place is very new and VERY close to my house so i really love that. However i felt a little underwhelmed with the outcome. the location itself is very clean and quiet, friendly staff and simple menu. i built my own bowl with black rice and tuna with citrus shoyu. i thought the idea of black rice was cool but it gave me a stomach ache after (that could be just me since no one else complained about it). it seems as if they dont marinate the fish beforehand which made it taste a little bland. i do agree the portion size could be bigger for the price but i really love the idea of the stamp system (buy 8 bowls get the 9th one free). also i had a couple of rough bits of tuna which was a little upsetting. overall, not bad. ill probably go back and try a few different bowls/sauce options since its so close to my house."}
{"text":"Tried their It's Lit bowl with my friend. I like that this place has a purple rice option. I liked the bowl, but it wasn't so great that I'd choose to go their regularly. I do find their bowls a little pricier in comparison to other places. Worth a try though."}
{"text":"I had 30 min for lunch. Took 10 seconds to order and pay and 1 min to make. Literally in and out in 2 min! 28 min left to eat! Love this place! So good for take out. Only issue is that this is a bit pricy - $12 dollar with taxes. I supposed the price is for the convenience. I would totally give this place 5 stars if they up the sashimi portion a tad bit and lower the price by $1! lol"}
{"text":"This is the only poke bowl place I've ever tried. So to me, this is the best poke bowl place. But I have been here 10+ times and I can honestly say that it is consistently great. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu. You can't make a mistake in choosing something because they're all tasty and great combination of ingredients. You do have the option of making your own bowl, which consists of choosing the type of rice, fish, sauce, and toppings you'd like on it. I love this because adding onto their 5 bowl suggestions, there are so many possibilities as to what you could have for lunch.  Everyone who works there is very nice and professional, and the service is very quick. The longest I've waited for my bowl is like 5 minutes. They have a rewards card where if you buy 10 bowls, you get one for free. If I were you, I'd take it because you will be returning to have another."}
{"text":"I came here once to try it out and I was disappointed. There are much better Poke places around the GTA and I wish I would have eaten some jerk chicken around the corner or grabbed a poutine instead.  Anyways the parking here is a hassle since you have to park underground at one of the condos and pay for it of course. I mean if the food was good normally I would not care.  Now on to the actual food... I got the Buddha Bowl and I can tell right off the bat that this place is either trying to cut costs or the owner is just really really cheap. The portions are super small compared to the other Poke places I have tried and my bowl had a TON of rice as opposed to the more expensive Protein pieces.  The \"lets give them more rice instead of ingredients\" trick doesnt work on someone who loves their protein.  My friend ordered the buddha bowl as well and we all paid....then she realized she wanted some extra seaweed so then the cashier goes oh that will be an extra 85 cents..... okay sure...now I dont have to tell you that customer service is probably worth more than 85 cents but watver.  I took out my visa card and paid the 85 cents. On top of that, the Poke bowl was bland and had no flavor.    I am not sure how long this place will last giving small portions and no flavor and charging pennies for every ingredient but I do hope that they change something because I love my Poke Bowls."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after hearing so many things about it. $13.99 to build your own bowl and $12.99 for their signature bowls. I got the build your own bowl with salmon, black rice, squid salad, spicy seaweed salad, tomago and the spicy unagi sauce. Overall it was only alright for me. The unagi sauce was a bit overwhelming and I could taste it in every bite. I would've rather tasted the sushi rice and if I needed, I would've added soy sauce. The squid salad was not very appetizing. It didn't really mix well with everything and I believe it had some pickled vegetables in it. I mean, I probably would come back to try something else but I'd probably stick with the basic ingredients and just sriracha mayo."}
{"text":"I was SUPER SUPER excited to try this place, first Poke to be honest ..  im a huge sushi person so I thought this would be heaven for me .   I built my own bowl, it was very good but i did not enjoy the salmon at all. Very bland. I added soy sauce into my bowl though and then it was much better ..   The service is very good, theyre very friendly."}
{"text":"I ordered the It's Lit Signature Bowl to try while M ordered the Poke Eats Signature Bowl to try.  For my bowl, I asked to try the black sushi rice since I had never seen that offered before in a poké bowl.  I also asked to try the crab salad in my poke bowl too since I absolutely adore crab salad and I wanted to see how they made it here.  The It's Lit Signature Bowl contained black sushi rice, salmon, spicy mayo, avocado, spicy cucumber, and cherry tomato.  Like I had mentioned, mine also contained white sushi rice as a mix and crab salad.  I really liked it.  The portion size was decent, perfect for lunch or dinner.  The chunks of salmon were really fresh which is so important when making poké bowls.  The spicy mayo was perfect for my taste since it wasn't too spicy but had just enough spice to make everything sing.  Avocados are also a great addition to any dish containing raw fish and the crab salad was wonderful with not too much dressing.  All in all, it was a really great tasting poké bowl.  M's Poke Eats Signature Bowl contained white sushi rice, tuna, maple sesame shoyu, cucumber, sweet corn, and crab salad.  It looked great as well and when I tried the tuna, I liked it."}
{"text":"Finally a place to have poke in North York! The location is convenient for those who are traveling by foot or subway, but it may be a bit difficult to find parking if traveling by car.   You can choose to either order a signature bowl (regular size $10.99) or build your own bowl (snack size $6.99 or regular size $10.99). I made my own snack-sized bowl with black sushi rice, salmon, avocado, seaweed salad, all the garnishes, and maple sesame shoyu sauce.   The black rice was good - not exactly sure how to describe the taste, but it tasted healthy! it was a little harder, more grainy, and a bit more dry than white rice. Unlike some other poke places downtown, their fish wasn't pre-marinated. One of the workers told me the reason was to maintain the freshness of the fish - the salmon did taste fresh, but I found it bland without the marinade. The maple sesame shoyu sauce was both sweet and savoury, but was very light and didn't add much to the overall taste of the poke bowl. I think the salmon bowl pairs better with spicy mayo sauce, which my friend tried. There's an option of 'lite' sauciness, but I'd recommend going with the regular, especially with the black rice and non-marinated fish.  There's limited seating (only ~2-3 seats), but there's a food court in the building with tables where you can sit down to eat. The cashier was very friendly, which made my first experience here more enjoyable! I've definitely had tastier poke bowls elsewhere, but I'd likely come back when I'm craving poke due to the convenience of the location."}
{"text":"Not the best poke bowl but decent I got a build my own with black sushi rice, salmon, pineapple,seaweed salad, squid salad masago, added the wasabi peas for a dollar but was sad to see it was just a dust of them not the actual peas. I got the spicy unagi sauce but it's not spicy at all. Really lacking flavour as well I find. I also go all the garnishes except the ginger. I rather go back downtown to rollation if I want a good  poke."}
{"text":"Did not like the spicy salmon poke I got. It's too expensive for what you get. I paid additional for avocado and they only gave 4 small cubes. Not going back. Salmon had fishy smell as well."}
{"text":"Woohoo! A poke place in North York: we don't have to go all the way Downtown for our poke fix any more.  They're located in the big green Emerald Tower building; entrance is accessible from Poyntz Ave. Nice, clean, bright small eatery with only one skinny bar table with three stools for eating in.  Hubby had the It's Lit bowl with Black Sushi Rice, Salmon, Spicy Mayo, Avocado, Spicy Cucumber, Cherry Tomato. I built my own with chopped kale, Salmon, Avocado, crab salad, mango, all the toppings and citrus shoyu dressing (not fond of the dressing). Both bowls were fresh and tasty; I especially enjoyed the pickled ginger that had some sweetness to it and the yummy and nutritious \"forbidden\" black rice (https://www.google.ca/amp/s/legionathletics.com/health-benefits-of-forbidden-black-rice/amp/).   The fish was cut into small bite size cubes; I prefer it that way since I'm not fond of the mouth feel of raw fish. Delicious, colorful, fresh tasting, healthy meal. They had some interesting drink choices as well."}
{"text":"It's just really good poke. The bowls have a good degree of customization but aren't super wild - no really unusual toppings or sauces, just good solid choices. I've only had the salmon for my protein, but it's good quality fish and very smooth. I do feel that their food quality is very good in general and the toppings are nicely fresh.  The maple shoyu sauce is really good and what I would recommend to a poke beginner. They don't use a ton of it so err on the side of more sauce if you're into it (and yes, you can change the sauce level - I didn't realize). The black rice is good, kind of a glutinous texture and pretty aesthetic. They cook the rice really nicely. Never tried the kale but it's nice to have a low-carb option.  Super small place but there's a food court in the building. They take card."}
{"text":"Such great poke bowls! I usually get their 'It's Lit' salmon poke bowl, sometimes replacing their original toppings with seaweed salad, corn, mango, and/or citrus shoyu. All are good, fish is very fresh and bowls are well made."}
{"text":"I really like this place! It's on the southwest corner of Yonge/Sheppard, right by Whale and in the same building as Love Me Sweet and H Cafe. They have both predetermined bowls and make your own. We came around 12:30 and was served by a friendly cashier. The menu is on a chalkboard by the doorway and has descriptions of each bowl as well as the instructions for make your own. Fish is fresh, and there is ample lighting in this location. We got the It's Lit (mm spicy mayo) and Buddha Bowl.   Prize wise: 10.99 for a regular bowl & 6.99 for a snack size   A snack size bowl is about 2 cups of food and a large is about 3.5 cups. The It's Lit bowl is super filling as there is black rice (??). They have a bar table with 3 seats and a long bench that seats another 3. Pro tip: you can ask for takeout and eat in the food court at the end of the hallway. Drinks they have include: Icha green tea, calpico and a few other soft drinks.   They are open until 7pm on weekdays and Saturday and closed Sundays."}
{"text":"Some may argue the overall portion of protein to rice may be slightly less than other poke joints in the city.  However Poke Eats stands above the rest in choice and freshness of ingredients used.  Black rice as a base and quality toppings. The fact that they prepare your protein at the time you order, not scooped up from a tray made who-knows-when, says it all.   Always fresh, always served with a smile."}
{"text":"This is an alright poke place! I'm excited that there's more and more places to have poke in Toronto now, but that also means there's more competition. I like how clean and fresh everything is and how you are able to get black/purple rice. Another good thing about the rice is that they give you quite a bit of it haha, they just pile that stuff on like it's lettuce! A downside of that, is the rice is really hot so it's a little weird with the raw fish and toppings. There wasn't any wow factor about this poke to be honest, it's tasty don't get me wrong and it's in a lovely neighbourhood if you're looking for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Awesome to have a poke place up here!!! also love how avacado wasnt extra charge unless you have extras !  BYOB everytime i came and it was perfect! The portion size is a little small, but it is less expensive compared to other poke places.   Also big con is their hours, wish it was open later instead of closing at 7!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since they've opened and it's delish.  I wish there was a bit more choice in toppings, but the toppings are fresh and the there some interesting items that you can choose.  It's just after eating here 10+ times, I'm looking for something else to try.  Maybe creating a weekly new dressing, or limited time ingredient would help keep the interest up.  I really like their Japanese Caesar dressing, and love that they offer the choice of kale as a base ingredient.  I can be as healthy or as unhealthy as I wanna be.  The owner and his servers are helpful and friendly.  Service is quick.  Parking is a bit of a bitch though."}
{"text":"Difficult to find parking but near the subway line"}
{"text":"Great food and even greater service. Everything is made to order and only the freshest fish and ingredients are used.  You can tell that the owner is very passionate about food and takes pride in the ingredients that he uses.   The location is very clean and modern looking.  There are a seats by the window should you decide to have it there, but it is primarily a take-out style restaurant.  You can also opt to have your food in the nearby food court area which has some extra seating available.  The menu is very concise.  You can choose to build your own custom bowl, or choose from their list of signature bowls, all of which are amazing.  Would highly recommend, especially if you take the TTC, as it is located right by the Yonge-Sheppard station.  If you plan to drive, note there is only street parking nearby available."}
{"text":"I had the \"Its Lit\" bowl - When I ordered half rice half kale the lady was so kind to explain that the rice could wilt the kale not making it taste optimal. I appreciated that. The bowl was tasty and had a generous heap of spicy mayo salmon on top. There was some avocado for the smooth buttery flavour and pickled ginger and cucumber to cut through the fat.The flavours melded together nicely.   The staff are really friendly and they gave me a points card for a free bowl after 8 bowls. Total came up to $10.99 + tax which is not bad for the area.   Would def go again, maybe try less mayo next time."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5     Service: 5/5     Atmosphere: 4/5  New Poke place in North York! Overall, it was great and all the ingredients were fresh. The great thing about a Poke bowl is that you can get all these flavours and textures mixed into one bite.   At Poke Eats, they have standard signature bowls but if you don't like any of the ingredients, you can create your own bowl for the same price. It was awesome because that means I can substitute for whatever I want. I basically ordered the Poke Eats bowl and substituted with black rice and changed up the toppings. The menu is easy to navigate even for an indecisive me. My friend ordered \"It's Lit\" and the spicy sauce was more than a kick. The only downside I experienced, and this is if I am being nit-picky, was that when I got towards the bottom of the bowl, the rice became a tad salty because the sauce drained to the bottom.   Definitely will return if I am in the area. They also have a loyalty program. They only open until 7pm on Saturdays though."}
{"text":"I'm relatively new to poke, but I think this place is great. The people are friendly, the food is delicious, and it's really healthy."}
{"text":"They use the finest Ingredients, fresh sushi grade fish and fresh vegetables. if you got into another place, they will mask the fish in marinate and over power the dish.  If you want to enjoy a fresh poke that showcase the Ingredients in the right way, come here."}
{"text":"The most basic/Instagram-friendly place I've ever been to. A few of the aesthetic touches include:  - succulents on the table - custom welcome mat & tiles - clean, white interior  I built my own regular-sized poke bowl, and included salmon, crab salad, mango, and maple sesame shoyu sauce. A really great meal, but I think the portions are slightly smaller than other stores. My friend got the \"It's Lit\" bowl, and she especially enjoyed the black sushi rice.   The employees were super nice in helping us decide on an order. Their card reader wasn't working when we came, but probably a temporary issue. There is only one table, but it was empty when we came around lunch on Saturday, so I don't think it ever gets too packed. I was able to park on Poyntz Avenue, but it's probably easier to transit here. Would definitely recommend if you're in North York and craving some poke!"}
{"text":"Poke Eats is now my go-to spot for poke. When it first opened I thought the protein portions were a bit small, but now it looks like they've settled into a groove. I love that it offers black sushi rice (and if you \"build your own bowl\" you can do a 1/2 sushi rice + 1/2 kale base) and its sauces are also interesting (the maple shoyu and Japanese Caesar are my go-to's). Another perk is that Poke Eats has a loyalty card: buy 8 regular bowls and get the next 1 free. But the biggest draw for me is that I think Poke Eats tastes very clean and fresh - something that's not always true with other poke places. If you're in the Yonge and Sheppard area, I'd definitely recommend paying it a visit."}
{"text":"I have stopped by twice. 'It's Lit' is becoming my favourite. I love the Black Rice. The Salmon was fresh too. The portion looks small but was quite filling.    Not much seating space but there is Food Court in the building. You can usually find seating there.  A good Lunch option if you work in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've tried many different poke bowl places around downtown Toronto. The price for the regular bowl is very reasonable compared to many places like Pokito and Rolltation. They are also very generous with the salmon. However I think the sauces need a little more work. The spicy mayo flavor is not really strong enough. I would really like them to offer an unagi sauce or give you he option to do more than 1 sauce since there is quite a bit of rice. The garnishes are all free and there are 3 toppings included. The spicy cucumber added a nice crunch to the bowl."}
{"text":"Ordered the PokeEats ($10.99) which consisted of white rice, tuna, shoyu, crab salad, and a series of other garnishes. They let you substitute white rice for black rice and vice versa. The food was good, the portion size was good and the ingredients went well together.   The service was great, the employee working there told us the two bowls that were popular (PokeEats and It's Lit) and told us how we could build out own bowls. The wait for our food was also short (although we were the only customers there at the time). Also, despite what Yelp says, they actually close at 8pm, not 7pm.   The place still seems relatively new, the interior was bright and clean. There was only seating for 3, so definitely a take out place. But there's seating in the food court which is in the same building, so you can always eat there.   They also have a rewards program where you get the 9th bowl free."}
{"text":"I had the PokeEats bowl.  The portion is decent between rice and tuna.  I just prefer there was a bit more sauce as it taste very blend without the sauce."}
{"text":"Fresh good poke bowl Can customize own bowl Comes in regular or snack size Friendly aervice"}
{"text":"Went to Poke Eat on a whim Friday.  It's not haute cuisine, but it's not bad either. Had some white Tuna in a bowl with both black and white sushi rice.  It was quite tasty,  and the portion was just right.   Staff (owners?)  are very nice and friendly.  The location is very clean and bright. Not great to eat in,  though,  cause not a lot of seats to go around."}
{"text":"Got the regular sized Buddha which is white tuna poke with both white and black sushi rice, and edamame, cucumber and mango toppings. The portion was good for $12.40 after tax and everything tasted very fresh. The white tuna cubes were very large. The one thing that threw me off a little was how sweet and fragrant the mango was. Normally, I like my mangos sweet, but in the poke, it over powered everything else and stuck out like a sore thumb. I ended up just picking out the mango pieces and eating them separately.   The service is excellent, they were extremely helpful and the meal was prepared very quickly. The store environment is very bright, clean, and modern. The seating is very limited since it's meant to be a take out place, but there is a food court right around the corner for those who want to sit and eat there."}
{"text":"Came here and ordered the regular size Buddha bowl. This is probably the only place I've had poke so far where I was actually full after. That being said that was probably because they give me more rice than other places. Personally I felt like there could have been more fish and more sauce but overall the flavours of the sauce, fish and toppings complimented each other well. Would come again but I'd ask for more sauce next time."}
{"text":"Okay so this review is based off of what I had yesterday and it was the Budda bowl and the custom made bowl I made with salmon.  Portions: 1/10... I asked the girl at the front how much poke is actually put in the bowl and she said 100 Grams and when it was presented in the bowl, it looked like I paid $10.99 for nothing. I was able to pick 3 sides to go with the salmon.. And it was avocado, seaweed salad, and edamame.. Hardly anything was put on in it. Stingy with everything.   Quality:  1/10... I've tried AMAZING poke in LA, and Hawaii... And I know Toronto is try to pick up a new trend, but if you can't do it right, you might as well not do it at all even with giving the nori and seaweed, looks like it isn't fresh at all.   Price:  I paid $10.99 for each bowl and must say I regret all of it immediately. I hate being honest but it was the worst poke I've ever tried in my life.   Final verdict: nice people, terrible food. If you are going to charge people $10.99 per bowl (regular size) then please at least step up your portions and quantity!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. I come by whenever I can because I love poke. The portions are great, I'm usually full and they are always delicious. The place is owned by a young friendly guy and he always builds a relationship with his customers!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place for poke! Even though they don't have sushi burritos, I like how they give you the option to build your own bowl for 10.99! This is honestly the closest place from where I live since all the poke places are opened downtown. I had the white rice with double salmon, avocado, and it was mixed with the spicy mayo sauce with sesame seeds on top! I liked the little kick the spicy mayo had and how well it mixed with the flavors. Compared to other poke places I've tried I find that the portion is a lot bigger and more filling than other locations. The staff was also super nice and explained everything to me thoroughly. Definitely coming back because I'm addicted to poke!"}
{"text":"You can tell that they put a lot of work into making the combinations. I come and visit every month for a large kale salad bowl. The ingredients are fresh and I'm rarely disappointed.  I normally get the spicy mayo salmon with spicy cucumber, fish roe, squid salad, avocado and all the garnishes minus ginger.  The place is clean, the owner is nice and I don't think there is a better spot in the area for good poke."}
{"text":"My wife and I just had this after having a Poke crave. We live in the area so it's a bonus.  Our first experience with Poke was in Hawaii, arguably Poke ground zero.  My friends have told us a few joints have popped up in town so we intend to hit all of them this Spring and Summer.  This place is pretty new at the time of this review and experience.    I ordered a custom bowl of salmon and maple sesame shoyu with a variety of toppings.  The rice and shoyu were super flavourful.  The other toppings added a nice balance to the bowl.  The part that disappointed me the most was the portion of salmon or lack thereof.  My picture should say enough.   Anyone who has ever had Poke can attest to the fact that the fish is the main attraction so suffice to say, the portion here was a huge disappointment -- which is too bad because it was tasty.  The fish was cubed into tiny fingernail portions.  Again, I'm comparing this experience to the experiences we had in Hawaii.  Every joint there have CHUNKS of fish swimming in shoyu.  I've been to sushi restaurants in Toronto that serve sashimi salads and/or chirashi at the same price point and they easily served three times the fish portion.  I will give this place another chance in the future but I hope they will see this review and work on this part because the place has potential."}
{"text":"This place is so good!   I like this place a lot and I'm so excited about it. The place is really bright and clean, service was quick and friendly but the real star is the poke!   I went for a build-your-own bowl. The pre-made bowls also looked good but I wanted something a bit more customized to my liking. If you're not sure what would go with what or are overwhelmed thinking about what to get, the pre-made bowls are the way to go!   The way it works is you choose your base, which is either a rice or chopped kale, then you can choose a protein, I chose the salmon, which is sashimi style cubes tossed in some type of creamy dressing. Then you can pick your toppings, I chose avocado, crab salad and mango. I'm happy I went with mango, I felt like it needed something sweet, without it, it would have been lacking in something, but that's just my opinion, I love sweet and savory combinations in food. Lastly, you choose your sauce and garnishes, I went with all the garnishes, which includes scallions, sesame seeds, radish to name a couple and the spicy mayo. I might try one of the shoyu sauces next time as I felt mine to be almost overly mayo-y but it was still delicious.   Every bite was a bit different. You'll get different things in each bite and in different combinations, it's textually pleasing and refreshing, not overly heavy but a great portion for lunch or even dinner. I finished the whole large portion but was probably more than full. If you have a very large appetite you may not be full from this meal but for an average appetite, it's plenty.  Unlike some people, I found the protein portion to be pretty good for the price, I had a piece of salmon in almost every bite and they were nicely sized chunks. Perhaps they've improved this based on reviews. For $12 and some change including tax, I'd say it's a good value. They also have a snack size for $6.99 + tax.   I went at around 4:45 on a Tuesday and there was one person waiting for their food ahead of me, but once I placed my order it was ready within 5 minutes. They did run out of the red tuna but they mentioned this right away and luckily I was looking for salmon. I'm not sure when they are most busy but if they're expecting a dinner rush, they might want to work on their inventory control so as to have everything available.   It is mainly a takeout place, there is a bar to sit and eat but no wait service or anything like that. The service was friendly and quick. They mentioned right away that they were sold out of something so I wouldn't be disappointed after ordering which is a good customer service experience.   Overall a great first experience for me, I loved my bowl and will be back to try some different combinations!"}
{"text":"Good ingredients but they don't give you as much as other places like Poke guys and Kensington market poke places. But overall everything is very fresh and tasty. The trick is to get a snack size poke bowl and pay for the extra protein $3! :)"}
{"text":"I have been to several poke places in Toronto; Poke Eats is the best among all, I think.   The reasons are:  1. Poke portion is generous even for snack size.   2. They don't put way too much sauce on top which I can still taste the poke.   3. They don't charge extra for tuna or avocado. Both are from the regular selection  4. Price is very reasonable. $6.99 for snack size which is substantial. $10.99 for Regular bowl.   They have very friendly service and simple menu. There is a foodcourt in the same complex where you can enjoy the food comfortably. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Poke Eats is the first specialty Poke eatery opened in North York, north of the 401. While it is away from all the other usual Poke places in Toronto located in downtown, we must say we are extremely impressed by the high quality fish and freshness offered. The restaurant is located at the bottom of the newly built condo building at Yonge and Sheppard, right across from Whole Foods. The restaurant has simple yet elegent décor. It is brightly lit as it is located on the corner. This place is mainly for takeout as there is only a small bench for eating.  What makes Poke Eats stand out from all the other Poke restaurants is probably the quality and the freshness of the fishes. Chef Raymond Choo has been in the industry for a long time and is committed to only using he highest-quality sourced fish. The chef buys tuna and salmon in bulk and freshly cut them right inside the store, so that all Poke Bowl are served with delicious fishes.  The menu is simple, with 4 preset Poke menu, or the BYOB (Build-your-own-bowl) option. Each of the Poke comes in either the regular size or snack size.  We have tasted their signature Poke Eats bowl, which is made of White Sushi Rice, Tuna, Maple Sesame Shoyu, Cucumber, Sweet Corn, Crab Salad. We must say this is probably the most declious poke bowl we have tasted, the tuna is very fresh and delicious and all the ingredients mixed well to made for a good medley. The portion of fish is also very generous and for the regular bowl, you will get a full and satisfying meal. Also, all the bowls already include garnishes and soy sauce, so you don't risk adding too much soy sauce to the bowl and make the bowl too salty.  We have also tried the build-you-own-bowl, where you can choose the base (rice), meat (fish), sauce, 3 toppings, and garnishes. The spicy mayo is very refreshing is very fresh blends in well, unlike other spicy mayo we have tasted which usually overpower other ingredients.   Overall we are very impressed with Poke Eats and will definite come back to satifisfied with the Poke craving!"}
{"text":"It's convenient location since it's next to subway access. The store is very neat and bright. Staffs are very friendly. I tried all of their menu and my favorite is It's Lit. the bowl has great combination from fish, spicy mayo sauce and I added cherry tomatoes. My friend is vegetarian and she loves kale machine with tofu and endame. Overall, we have good experience."}
{"text":"This will be my no. 1 spot to go when I want to eat poke! Everything in this bowl is so FRESH and so vibrant looking so you will definitely enjoy eating it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"After hearing so much raving about Poke Eat, I have finally decided to give this place a try.  The sushi bar was really small, modern and clean. It is more of a take-out kind of place. They have one bar table with only 3 three stools. They do have a bench on the side to sit, but that's if you don't mind eating without a table.  The customer service was great. As soon as we entered, the cashier woman greeted us with a warm smile. She was so sweet and welcoming. She had walked me through the menu options, gave a few suggestions and was overall very helpful. We didn't have to wait long for the food since it was just us three there at the time.  The poke bowl was pretty good, I must say. I got the Lit bowl which mainly consist of smoke salmon, black sushi rice and spicy mayo. The rest of the ingredients was mostly small amounts of garnishes. I was able to substitute the avocado with the seaweed salad with no extra charges. To me that was a bonus. The  seaweed salad had a good consistency and a bit of crispiness. The salmon had that perfect buttery texture and tasted really fresh. I really like the spicy mayo as well, that is a must have for that extra flavour.  Overall, I did enjoy my experience there and will be back again to try the tuna."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food quality to value ratio. Added a star for excellent service.  Came here on a Thursday night and service was awesome, but the food fell short from my expectations. Everything was very fresh ... but flavour-wise, was very lacking. Portion is decent for one person, but nearly $15 after tax.  I ordered the Poke Eats signature bowl and found the entire thing to be completely lacking in flavour, but perhaps this is my own personal preference. The fish was fresh, as were all the other components, but I was slightly disappointed by each mouthful I took.   I found myself wishing that I was eating from a different poke place. If you have a craving for poke in the North York area, this MIGHT satiate  your craving. Perhaps I just like it when there are more sauces on my poke to spice up the flavour.   I'll give it another chance before making a final decision."}
{"text":"I thought the food items look sooo good on Yelp but they didn't. I ordered their signature poke eats bowl with salmon and their Lit bowl spicy tuna and their tuna bowl and none were great. The fish was chewey and combination of veggies and sauce was blah, not saucy enough and not enough flavours. Will not try here again."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Poke Bowls, but always have to go to downtown when I crave them.  So I was super excited to finally hear about this place opening in my area.   The service was good, friendly, got our poke bowl within 8-10 minutes of ordering. There was about 3 people infront of us on a weekday.  The place is small with only 3 seats, so ideal for take-out  Now to the actual food, I was quite disappointed to see how small the portion was.  I was expecting the same size I usually get from Poke Guys, so I was even considering of getting the smaller size as I usually don't end up finishing the bowl.  Well, I still got the regular size and it was tiny. I thought they took my order wrong and gave me the smaller size, but nope. I was still not full after eating it, and went to Jerk King nearby.  Also, they don't give you alot of protein and lacks sauce, which is the main ingredient.  I would never go back, and would rather go to Poke Guys next time I go to downtown.  VERY disappoiting and waste of money."}
{"text":"Finally decided to stop by this place passing through Sheppard station. It's a small simple shop, clean lines, limited seating. After having gone to a handful of different poke restaurants, I would say the portions here are pretty standard for the price, maybe a touch leaning towards the small size. Fish to rice ratio for me was quite balanced, with every bite having a generous amount of fish without having to aggressively ration for it near the end. The menu features a handful of set combinations and build-your-own options as well. I ordered the Buddha and the It's Lit.  Overall, what I greatly enjoyed for both choices were the use of black/purple rice (very hearty and robust pairing), the pickled ginger (oddly sweet, and a nice palate reset to get more out of the intensity of the flavours in between bites), and the fried shallots/onions (less earthy than the taro chips other poke places use as a crispy component but a stronger flavour). Flavours are layered with care and bowls are \"plated\" (ha.) aesthetically. The Buddha features albacore tuna of which the flavour I felt was overpowered by the citrus soy sauce they used (too salty!---I hope it's applied after the fact and not a marinade because I would opt to order it on the side). The mango bits were unexpectedly quite ripe and sweet and very interest contrast to the rest of the bowl. The It's Lit features spicy salmon which I could taste was quite fresh---a clear winner/safe choice for anyone coming for the first time.  I hope to come back and fill up my loyalty card and will be exploring the customization options and hopefully see some seasonal/limited time special combinations in the future. Recommended."}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with all the high ratings for this place.  I had the Poke Eats bowl and the tuna in it was super stringy and fibrous in texture.  Felt and tasted disgusting going down my throat.  The  tuna wasn't soft and tender like at most other poke places around Toronto.  I was so disappointed, couldn't even finish the already small portion size. If you like your fish hard and fibrous in texture, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I had the Poke Eats Signature and I found it to be a well thought out combination of ingredients. The tuna and veggies were all fresh and the sauce wasn't overwhelming. The fish to veggie to rice ratio was good. The staff were friendly and my poke bowl didn't take that long to make. Unfortunately the seating within is very limited, but there's a food court further in the building. They didn't have a lot of people in line when I got there on a Saturday afternoon, so your weekday experience may differ."}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! You feel good after eating here. Everything is fresh made to order, perfect portions and reasonably priced. Have been to Hawaii twice and became addicted to the Poke. This place is on par if not better than some of the places in Hawaii (home of Poke bowls). Service is a little slow but that's expected when you want fresh good quality food. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"So yummy!! I love this type of food. It's very healthy and great quality. It's like getting a huge sushi roll for what you would pay for a small one at a sushi restaurant. The staff was super friendly and the place is very clean. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to try something different."}
{"text":"Great place for poke. They do things fresh here - I personally saw one of their personnel pull out a huge salmon and fillet it. Quite a show.   The \"its lit\" bowl is excellent with Black Sushi Rice, Salmon, Avocado, Cucumbers and Spicy Mayo. I highly recommend this bowl. Since I was new, they explained the menu and recommended us their chef's choice. The only negative part about this place is that there isn't a lot of space to eat, so you'd be better off taking your bowl and going to the food court in the building."}
{"text":"Happy to see poke making its way further north.  I won't have to drive downtown for a fix. I like that I can customize my bowl. I opted for black sushi rice, tuna, shoyu dressing, avocado, mango, crab salad with all the garnishes. The downfall is since it's dressed to your taste, the poke hasn't marinaded so it's not as flavourful. Portions are also small."}
{"text":"Finally! A poke place in the area! Tried the 'it's lit' bowl with tuna and it was absolutely amazing! Lots of flavour and the perfect rice to fish ratio!   Place is nice and bright and staff are super friendly! Too bad there isn't a big area to sit..."}
{"text":"This is my poke go to. I live down the street and its really convenient for me. I love their menu since you can build up your own Poke or you can settle to their signature menus. Customer service is great and they are friendly. Also, they serve big portion every order or you can order a snack size. Overall, the food, portion and customer service are good."}
{"text":"I wanted to try some of the newly opened Allwyns in the Emerald condo building but got distracted by the new poke place near the front of the building.  There really isnt a lot of places in this area for poke and i really likevit so it got my attention.  The place is small but has 3 stools to eat at.  Its vwry bright and clean since its new.  There werev2 people working the counter but there wasnt anyone there so no wait.  I got the large custom bowl with white rice and tuna.  There arent as many choices as there arevin some of the downtown Poke places but it\"s also cheaper at $10.99 for the large.  It was good but the only thing i would change is more toppings to rice and a bit more sauce.  Im sure i will be back when i have a weekend poke craving."}
{"text":"Standard poke place, filling, and gives a good amount of toppings. Appreciated the option for mango but wish there was pineapple as a topping."}
{"text":"Pictured: \"Poke Eats\" Bowl  I have tried the \"Poke Eats\" and the \"It's Lit\" bowls. Both bowls are very delicious and fresh. I really enjoyed the various garnishes that are included with the bowls. The \"Poke Eats\" bowl has white sushi rice, while the \"It's Lit\" has black sushi rice. If the predetermined options do not suit your fancy, they also have a fantastic build-your-own-bowl option! Any place that allows customization to your dish is great in my books. Also, the menu item names are very fun and creative.  The presentation of the bowls are fantastic, filled with vibrant colours from the fresh fish to the fresh vegetables. You can really tell that a lot of precision and care went into these bowls from the way that all of the ingredients are cut and presented.  The service is great, everyone is very friendly and efficient. The bowl preparation is not too lengthy, so you get your bowl within minutes.  The location is great especially for those that are getting off from the subway. It's right at the corner of the building, so it's very visible. I really like the almost all-white theme of the restaurant, it feels very calming and is very clean.  If you like poke bowls, this is the place to go. The price is very reasonable for the portions you receive. Another nice thing is that this is a smaller, independent restaurant where you can get that quality, care, and service you cannot get at franchises or large corporations."}
