{"text":"Didn't notice this place exist until someone posted on yelp. Very friendly service and good craft beer on tap. There's a Food truck right outside of the store on the weekend."}
{"text":"Good beer in a friendly brewery! I like the coffee blonde style beers so I found No Cream No Sugar as much an enjoyable beer for those of us in the blonde beer club. I like the flavors and the coffee notes. My all time favorite is Wooden Robot Good Morning Vietnam and Cabarrus Vanilla Coffee blonde beer from that brewery. So most of my comparisons go to those two. This No Cream No Sugar is quality coffee flavors but a bit flat in comparison to my favorites.   

The brewery is a small building in the back of the parking lot by the fitness building.
They had a food truck but we didn't eat. My husband liked the Pterodactyl IPA beer the best from his $6 flight."}
{"text":"If only they served food. Love the beer selection and it's a great meeting space too."}
{"text":"Great beer, great people and great stuff to do, including bands.  Best band selections each week.  How do the do it?"}
{"text":"Sundog Saison is my jam!  Place has a great atmosphere and is super clean.  Will be back whenever I'm in town and hopefully run into Travis one of these times"}
{"text":"Very nice selection of beers in a really nice venue. Lots of space, with darts and other games available to play. We all enjoyed our beer flights, and will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Great little place to hang out with friends or family good beer and great people make this a great spot to visit."}
{"text":"Had a great time here. Beer was good and cold. Started with the sampler set. Loved all but one. Had a bluegrass band, that rocked the house, but not so loud you couldn't talk to your friends. Great place just hang out and play some darts, or games, and even a couch to kick back on."}
{"text":"Why was this place not on YELP?! I added it!  It is hidden in a large parking lot off of Highway 74 W.  I believe the place was an old Blockbuster years ago.  It is a rather large place and very open.

The service was good, but I wish we would've gotten more conversation and more explanation on the beers. There are quite a few brews on tap to try.  Pretty good selection too.  

Now that I've put this place on the YELP map, come check it out!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to find this cool brewery tucked away in little Indian Trail! My sis and I wanted something cold and flavorful to enjoy so I searched beer and found this gem. Its located in a strip mall off highway 74. The bartenders were friendly and helpful with my sister's allergies and due to their knowledge they were able to suggest beers she could enjoy. I wanted to try several so I settled on a flight: Chamomile stout, Peter piper red, Belgian, and IPA which was recommended even though I don't love IPAs... it was so balanced and great! I enjoyed all the beers and will be back. The place is spacious and comfortable with beautiful hand crafted wood accents. The bartenders also mentioned they have yoga classes, cool! There's a small refrigerator behind the bar with Boar's Head meat and cheese and some chips for purchase too. Come support small breweries!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to the area!  My wife and I got a groupon for a couple of flights and ventured out to the brewery on a Raining evening.  The place is in an older shopping center off 74 by the cook out and biscuitville, where a Blockbuster used to be (for you youngin's that's where we used to have to drive to in order to rent a VHS movie for $4/night).  

The tap room is a modest size, nothing huge but big enough.  The brewing area is tiny - it was impressive they had such a wide selection.  The flight was good - with multiple IPA's and the Pale Ale garnering high scores from me.  

A live blue grass band was playing on one end, with dart boards and board games located on the other side.   Tables and chairs are random, mismatched tables.  The lighting was horrible - very dark, especially with it being rainy - made the place appear a little dull.  Luckily the short-haired blonde bartender was friendly, helpful, and passionate about the place to add a bit of light to the room.  

We got a growler filled of Blondina for a hot afternoon that we enjoyed the other week and are excited to visit again!  Hopefully the sun will be out the next visit or the lights are on to get the last star!"}
