{"text":"Loic is nothing but a glorified take out joint with over priced over hyped food. They proclaim \"the best chicken salad in Toronto\"...not hardly. There are many other places offering a better tasting chicken salad for a more reasonable price. Yes, they may be in the price range of Subway but with far fewer ingredients and pre-wrapped in cellophane as if you were buying flowers. Cellophane doesn't seal the sandwich so it's exposed to air after it's made and placed in the cooler. They charged $5 for approximately 100grams of potato salad, which wasn't even enough to cover the bottom of the container...3 bites and it was gone. Avoid this place unless you like paying high prices for low quantity & questionable quality."}
{"text":"I came in here for lunch when I forgot my packed lunch at home.  I figured I would give it a shot since I've been trying to eat healthier lately.  The place is very clean and has a fresh smell to it.  On one end of the counter is a salad display, and the other are breads and deli.  I ordered a quarter rotisserie chicken and some quinoa salad.  The chicken was free range and done just perfectly. The meat nearly fell of the bone and practically melted in my mouth.  The quinoa salad was kind of plain with some random vegetables, but had a nice subtle citrus taste.  The meal cost about $12.50, but it was worth it to know I was getting something healthy and tasty."}
{"text":"Loic Gourmet really is as good as it gets! Their food is always delicious and exciting, their menu changes every day, they use local produce, free range meats, biodegradable plastic, and have vegetarian options that shock your taste-buds with flavors you've never had before! I'd be satisfied eating there every day, and they cater too! I know who's doing my wedding!"}
{"text":"Loic has become an alternative to going out for me and my wife. It's a take-out place, not somewhere you go to eat. Last time I had the most amazing brisket with an apricot sauce. The salmon puff pastry is also outstanding. Great sides. And desserts include a creme brule that the owner brules right in front of you.  If you live in the neighbourhood, you have to check it out. Just go."}
{"text":"in loic, its hard to know what to choose first.  its not so much that theres a crazy amount of food from which to choose, its that the food thats displayed looks very tasty and colourful.  the store is set up in a very spacious way with bars and comfortable square top bar stools lining the window as you might munch away.  should you decide to take away your food (which i believe is what this place is geared towards) you will be doing so for the most part in biodegradable containers (that you can throw in your green bin), and in fact are encouraged, should you be a regular to bring in your own containers, or put a deposit on one they give you so waste is minimized.  nice work.  now the most delectable thing there to my eyes was the croque monsieur.  i didnt have it this time, but i will one day, mark my words.  from what i remember its a ham sandwich (probably with more great stuff in it) topped with bechamel sauce and cheese - and they heat it up.  good form.  i divided my meal into two stages.  i went there just after i went swimming, and i had a hankering for a soup.  i had the chicken soup which was pretty good.  it was filled with little pieces of chicken, carrots, onions, and rice.   the colour of it was golden and it was accompanied by its own little plastic container of croutons - probably homemade and definitely tasty.  while that warmed my pot i decided to go back to the counter for a plate with a couple of their salads to adorn it.  well they adorned my lips, my tongue, my fingers and the chicken soup in my stomach and they were deeelicious.   one was a cauliflower salad with some dried berries and nuts and the other was their version of potato salad - nothing like stuff youd imagine from swiss chalet or whatnot.  you can pick that meal up for about 13 bucks.  so its not cheap, but surely not exorbitant either and if you want stuff that is at times healthy and at times not as healthy but made with care, innovation and good taste (read bechamel on a sandwich!) then youll enjoy loic.  they also provide little meals you can take home and prepare with their instructions, such as duck confit or vegetarian terrine.    they offer catering, delivery (coming soon in local areas) and prepared christmas dinners as well.  bon appetit."}
