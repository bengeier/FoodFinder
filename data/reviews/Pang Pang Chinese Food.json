{"text":"Worst food ever.... I can't even imagine how they are still in business.  Ordered Chinese for delivery. Everything was reheated. Returned the food. They were nice enough to give me my money back."}
{"text":"Sorry Kelly,  but Kyle is right 20 years ago there was a red rooster in that strip mall, along with a turbo gas station.  It was outstanding back then.  Sadly now it's different and not as good as it once was."}
{"text":"I really love pang pang we order it every time we get Chinese food they are quick to fix anything that we don't like and always offer free rice with purchase. I love the dumplings here and the ginger beef is amazing!"}
{"text":"Disgusting, flavourless food. We ordered 3 dishes and two bowls of soup. Only one dish was eaten (by a 13 yr old boy who would eat worms if he was hungry enough). The other 2 dishes and both bowls of soup were barely touched. We told the young lady we did not like any of the food and we were treated with indifference. To top up this glorious meal, we were charged full price. No offer of a discount or a replacement."}
{"text":"Kyle H  is wrong - I have eaten here for 10+ years, it used to be located in a strip mall on 146 ave and was takeout/delivery only. It has NEVER been near a red rooster. It is still 90% of their business I think, hence why the sit down restaurant is rarely busy.   The service is ok, its just a family owned place... go relax and smile they will be happy to help you. In my years eating here I have seen so many people act like grade A douchebags I'm not surprised the servers are a bit gun shy. I have never had a reason to act like many people do.  Personally I don't understand the complaint about the menu not being extensive/large... they have 2 full pages of Chinese food - probably 90+ items and 2.5 pages of Vietnamese food with at least as many options.   That said. There is 1 thing that I believe is completely unique about this restaurant - it's Ginger Beef it is different and in my opinion better, than any ginger beef I have had at the many many places I have tried in Calgary. (ginger chicken is made the same way as well).   My favorite dish is 4D - the dumplings. Oddly they are the only Place I know that does not serve the hot chili oil by default with dumplings but you can ask for it. They know me now and bring it automatically.   Other dishes I like/love: - The vermicelli  (V54) - The spicy soup - pictured on the back page of menu (can't believe I forget the #) - Chicken in Black bean sauce  There's more ... its all quite good. the dumplings and ginger beef/chicken bring me back here instead of going to one of the other 1000 Chinese/Vietnamese restaurants in town."}
{"text":"8/30 - Underdog Challenge  So one day I found $20 bucks in my pocket, I decided to try this place out. I strolled in and it was completely empty. Granted it was during the day but it was on a Friday lunch hour. It took a while for someone to greet me but I wasn't the least bit annoyed, it seemed the lady wasn't used to having anyone come in at that time.  Anyways their menu bears the usual Chinese Vietnamese fares. Not a large menu but they seem to cover all the bases and one could get a huge solid meal here with a group of people. I decided on their rice vermicelli dish. One thing I really liked and found unique to their menu was that they offered appetizer/small servings of pho, which is what I often wish for and Vietnamese joints never seem to offer.  I'm flummoxed by how these tiny Asian establishments thrived despite being located within the forgotten pockets of suburbia. Seriously, Pang pang's been around for years and I've never met anyone in my neighborhood who has yet to step foot here."}
{"text":"Soo bad. Sad too cause I used to eat here twenty years ago when was by red rooster. Garbage now. Service and food."}
{"text":"Not good - the rice was the worst I've ever eaten from any Chinese food joint.  The Cantonese noodles were barely better.  Chicken balls were decent, but over fried - if you can't stab it with a fork they were in the frier too long.  This is the closest Chinese food joint to our place but we'll go further to get our Chinese fix.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was Luke warm when we got it.  We were very hungry so we just ate it without a fuss. The won ton was actually good, again borderline cold.  The chicken chop suey was pretty standard and the fried rice didn't have an egg in it.  The vermicelli noodles had absolutely no taste and the dish failed miserably. We mentioned at the end when we were paying that the food was cold and he didn't say a word or acknowledge, he just asked us if we wanted a receipt.  I won't go back."}
