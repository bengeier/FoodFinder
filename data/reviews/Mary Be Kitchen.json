{"text":"Eating healthy doesn't have to mean eating boring!  Ate off the lunch menu at Mary Be: the steak, roasted cauliflower, and mac n cheese. First off, the venue is super clean, bright, open and spacious; very inviting. The menu is built on healthy foods, prepared well, and with strong flavour profiles, avoiding the blandness that most of the existing healthy restos suffer from. The flank steak was cooked perfectly, and while I normally find flanks tough and not pleasant to eat, this one was quite soft with a nice texture, and the perfect touch of coarse salt to make the flavour pop. The masala roasted cauliflower was not mushy, and the carmelized onions on top added a nice kick of sweetness to compliment the spices on the cauliflower. The mac and cheese was silky and creamy. Oh, and yes, the damn chocolate chip and sea salt cookies were fresh and still warm when I had mine - so good - and the chocolate tahini sesame cookie was another unexpected treat - great intensity of flavour.  Pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I've eaten in and also ordered on foodora.  Everything is delicious.  I always get the salmon which is perfectly cooked.  Mac and cheese is awesome and the healthier options are great too"}
{"text":"My family and I have had two wonderful experiences at Mary Be. The food is delicious and the service is friendly. I highly recommend the tofu, the kale ceasar salad, the avocado toast,  the salmon, the chocolate chip cookies and the nature/granola bar. Healthy, flavourful, quick and filling. We will be going back."}
{"text":"We have now been back a couple of times and it wasn't quite as hectic. The space has been very well done compared to its previous incarnation - much more light and airy. The food was quite good. We've tried the mac'ncheese (good), beets (good), salmon (good) and an inedible coleslaw. (Also coffee and muffins - good).  But it still has the feel of a fast food joint. Find a table and put something on it to reserve it; line up and place your order; take your number; wait.
Maybe we're just too old for this. Spiga is still preferred."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, great service and surprisingly their steaks and salmon are very tasty for a healthy lifestyle restaurant. I highly recommend to anyone who has never been, and try out their grilled avacado, absolutely delicious!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast twice now on Saturdays. Really great place. Scandinavian in style. Place has a clean look to go along with its clean tasting food. Staff friendly and service is efficient. Had the avocado toast and regular breakfast. Super. No complaints. Accommodated customizations without attitude. 
Hope this place does well!"}
{"text":"Another great lunch at Mary Be! What a great meal to enjoy and feel good about eating...and the chocolate chip cookie is a must have!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite new brunch spot in Toronto. Really nice variety of healthy, yet tasty items to build a hearty meal from. The Dahl is an absolute must have, as is the delicious avo toast. You can add poached eggs to either, which are done, as you like, to perfection. Oh and the Kale Caesar is beautiful, and perfectly dressed (don't get dressing on the side!). The grilled tofu is one of the best tofu dishes you will ever have. Marinated in a gingery marinade, then grilled, then finished with scallions and such.

Also don't forget to try the espresso bar, as well as the cold drinks on tap, like kombucha and house made fresh sodas, very refreshing on a hot day.

Decor is pure bliss, very clean yet interesting and calming for that afternoon latte while you read your book in one of the comfy chairs in the seating area.

Location is great, just a few steps from St Clair station, off of Yonge St.

Must try!"}
{"text":"Who knew healthy could be so tasty!
I've been here twice in the last month because it's just so fresh, so yummy, so healthy, and the place is quite cozy too! 
I had: steak, kale salad, quinoa salad, spiced cauliflower, tofu, broccoli, gosh a whole lot of shareables. 
Every time a dish came out. I'd politely decline because it just looked so healthy... only to be blown away after my first the first bite."}
{"text":"Good for a healthy, hearty meal. 

The way ordering and the menu work is you order at the counter, pay, then the waiters bring you the food. Fairly simple menu style, where you pick any combination of warm side, cold side, protein, and/or stew. Pricing is very reasonable (I paid around $20+tip for dinner that included two sides, protein, and house lemonade). 

The food was great. I got mac & cheese and roasted beets as sides, and flank steak as protein. Something about it tasted really homemade, as it wasn't your typical drenched-in-oil-or-butter restaurant meal. My buddy had the grilled salmon as protein and he loved it. 

The place is new with beautiful brand new furniture and has an open, fresh, feel to it. I felt like an upscale hippie eating there. Wait, I think you wold call that a hipster."}
{"text":"So much flavour packed into every side dish, protein and housemade drinks. Super duper accommodating to Vegan's, celiacs, herbivores and omnivores. Bring your whole family! Also, the best tofu I've EVER had. Healthy & tasty."}
{"text":"I left my first visit to MaryBe very impressed. The owners took a shabby old pizza joint and turned it into a bright, airy and refreshing space. The vibe is perfectly in line with the food & drink offerings that are both healthy and delicious. 

My colleague and I started off our lunch with fresh lemonade which was the perfect balance of sweet & tart. So refreshing!

We shared the roasted sweet potatoes, masala cauliflower, kale & red cabbage caesar and roasted beets as well as the red lentil dahl. Everything was very fresh, hearty and so well composed. My favourites were the cauliflower and the caesar.

The best part was that we left feeling full but not gross as everything is so fresh & healthy. I'm looking forward to going back to try some of the other dishes!"}
{"text":"After walking by last weekend and looking at the menu, I was excited to finally try Mary Be for brunch on Sunday.  I arrived at 10:30 and there were still several empty tables (although by the time I left at 11:10, it was packed).  You place your order at the cash and they bring your meal to you making it a hybrid between a full sit down and take out counter/faster food establishment.  I can see the appeal during the week given the number of office buildings in the area.  For weekend brunch, I would have preferred a true sit down.  Now on to the food ... 
We both ordered the avocado toast with a RUNNY poached egg.  The toast was tiny and thin with a smashed browning avocado and half hard/half runny egg.  We were both quite hungry at after the toast and egg.  The toast (with egg) was about $10.  For a meal size toast (as opposed to ordering a toast as a side), it was quite underwhelming I can't say I would rush back despite the menu offering many interesting yet healthy options."}
{"text":"In all fairness i have enjoyed previous visits very much - the space is beautiful and the concept lovely. This recent visit though, left me very disappointed - ordered the grilled tofu and it was completely black and burnt - inedible. Couldn't get the taste out of my mouth so it ruined the rest of my order. Some of the sweet potatoes were also burnt. I was surprised the dish was deemed appropriate to leave the kitchen. Also i feel maybe if something is going to be called fresca it should taste similar to fresca? Not sure what the super sweet puree substance was... It wasn't terrible but nothing like fresca!"}
{"text":"One of the new hip and trendy locations along the St. Clair Corridor!

Place has amazing decor, atmosphere, and service... but was overall disappointed with the food.

Admittedly I haven't ordered much from there.  Got the 2 side orders for ~$11.00, and chose the broccoli and cauliflower.  My order got lost somehow which added about 10 minutes to my wait, which doesn't seem like much, but when you're on a 45 minute break, is a quarter of my lunch! 

For the broccoli, they gave me 4 florets. 4. They were large, granted, but when it comes to broccoli, the larger the size, the harder the stock.  Also because it was undercooked, the stock was all but inedible. The flavours weren't pronounced other than the char they had on the leaf side.

Cauliflower was much better, but didn't appeal to my tastes, so I won't comment on it. Portions were a little better though.

My coworker ordered the soup ($10.95) and didn't look like she got much. Probably about 1 ladle's worth.  

I will admit I'm not much of a fancy eater.  The whole 'organic/gluten free' movement kinda falls flat for me.  Hope this place all the best, as they seem to have good intentions! but I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy for any meal of the day! Perfect for eating in or takeout and lots of vegetarian and vegan options without the whole menu being for vegetarians/vegans (so everyone is happy)"}
{"text":"Mary Be be pretty great! Although relatively new to the scene, Mary Be Kitchen has already established itself as a favourite amongst the folks in my office.

Me personally, I like to get the mac 'n cheese and the quinoa salad as my sides and the grilled chicken as my protein. Everything comes up to about $17 with taxes and all, making it a pricier option for lunch. However, I'd argue that you get what you pay for and much more!

Pretty much all of the sides are excellent (especially the roasted cauliflower, mac 'n cheese, sweet potato, and quinoa salad), and the proteins are no slouch either. I've heard great things about the tofu, but I can't bring myself to order it when it comes time to pull the trigger. The portions are pretty generous, so you won't find yourself going hungry soon after your meal.

If you're looking to treat yourself to a health-conscious meal for lunch or dinner, I'd definitely give Mary Be a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and environment. Got a groovy 70s lounge thing going.  Clean and bright. Full of healthy people. Awesome vegan options."}
{"text":"I ordered the flank steak, mac and cheese, and lentils. The food was absolutely delicious.I was amazed by the amount of great side options available. The service was great, super friendly staff. I had the house kombucha to drink, which was also delicious! Honestly, I had no complaints whatsoever. Good price for absolutely delicious food and a great environment. I would highly recommend this place and will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. I work at the building next door and love coming in here for their healthy and actually really tasty healthy food. Their proteins are solid, but it's their sides that are what pack all the flavour. I've tried almost all the combinations and have never been disappointed. Only reason it's not 5 stars is because of the price, $17 for a lunch is a little too much for me. Pantry down at Rosedale has a similar offering with similar portions for cheaper."}
{"text":"Finally checked this spot out the other day for dinner as it's located right in my neighbourhood.  The inside is very spacious and cute, very refreshing for the Yonge and St.Clair area. There is no wait staff here, just place your order at the counter and place the number sign on your table and the food is brought out to you.  It's quite quick and efficient, but I also went on a day that was very quiet.  They have a ton of healthy options which is what this place is all about.  The prices seem reasonable for a 'healthy' restaurant.  My meal was about $17 with taxes in and I got to choose one protein and two sides.  I went with the chicken, green salad and roasted sweet potato.  The portion was pretty good and the food was of good quality.  I really liked the salad and potatoes, but I did think that the chicken was a bit bland.  It was tender though and cooked nicely but could've used more seasoning.  It comes with a green salsa type sauce but that was a bit bland as well. 

I will be back here to check out other menu items as well as their breakfast/brunch!"}
{"text":"Cute place to grab brunch with friends uptown! Love that they have healthy menu options. We tried the coconut spelt waffle (its only one waffle) and the weekender breakfast with salmon. Everything tasted great!

Portions are pretty small for the price and it's self service though. If you're hungry you definitely need to order a side or grab a muffin!"}
