{"text":"Photos are outdated.  All the food on the pics they don't serve anymore. However, the pork chop over rice was very delicious."}
{"text":"Came here with my family during vacation in LV. The inside is pretty small, and there`s really only 3 tables for big groups. I wouldn't recommend this place if you have more than 6 people. We also came on a bad day because one of the air conditioners was broken, so it was really hot in there. You seat yourself and grab a check-off list to mark what you want to order. I ended up getting the cuttlefish nugget noodle. The noodle was okay, soup was flavorful. The cuttlefish was extremely bland though. We also marked that we wanted to get the milk with mango snow ice. Turns out they ran out of mango and milk, but they didn't tell us until we finished our food. I have no idea why they didn't let us know in the beginning since we could've ordered a different one. We ended up not getting any. Bummer. Overall, this place is just okay. Nothing special. Would've been a 3 star but dropped one star for the lack of communication, especially since it wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"It's surprisingly easy to overlook this small, unassuming cafe. When we arrived in the Chinatown Plaza, my friend and I looked around a few times and realized it was right in front of us! The Little Kitchen Cafe is in between Mr. Sandwich and Noodle Pot.  Upon walking in, you'll be greeted by friendly waiters who will ensure you're taken care of the whole time. Placing an order is as simple as marking a number next to the entrees you'd like!   Their Taiwanese menu includes some appetizers such as wontons and crispy rolls or entrees like noodle soups. Each rice entree has a heaping pile of rice topped with minced pork with a side of greens, pickled veggies, and an overcooked soy sauce egg. My recommendations include the braised pork, Taiwanese sausage or the salt and pepper fried chicken.  The shaved snow is like a small avalanche of soft, layered ice cream and topped off with fruit and condensed milk. The fluffy texture is spot on, unlike the thick, gooey snow from other places. We created our own dessert and ordered a blueberry shaved snow with kiwi, condensed milk, and a pudding on top. Extra toppings are $0.50 each.  While the food is pretty standard, their shaved snow is one of the best you can find along Spring Mountain. You should bring some friends to help you dig through the mountains of food and dessert. At least, if you're up to sharing."}
{"text":"Honestly all I have ever had here is the shaved ice. But it is really good. I get the tradition brown sugar syrup kind. There are a lot od different toppings to choose from. But my favorite one here arw the taro balls they are kinda like taro flavored mochi. Super good.   Service here is also pretty good. The staff is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"mango snow ice with pudding  are really sweet but good. strong recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Service is super fast just like other Asian restaurant.  Fast in and out.  This place is quite small.  Expect to wait a little during rush hour.  Although they have a huge parking lot, but parking is a headache and sometimes you need to fight hard for one.  Yeah, Chinatown plaza, as you can imagine, people, people, and people.  Well worth to stop by if you look for authentic Taiwanese food in Vegas."}
{"text":"So far I've been there twice, and I love the food! I'm from Taiwan, and it has the taste of home :) . Service is great! Fast! Hospitable! And very generous too, when I asked for some clear soup that's not on their menu, they gave me a free but good portion of bowl of soup. I'm so glad there's one more place I could go when I miss food from home! :)"}
{"text":"This is about the most pathetic showing of a restaurant I have seen in Vegas. Taiwanese food is not easy to find in Vegas and it is a luxury to have. But I don't expect to be taken advantage of by greedy and cheap restaurants  Case: went in there on a Tuesday night to get shaved ice on this hot summer night. They were out of most ingredients except for mango and strawberry. I got a combo of the two and the lady proceeded to shave ice into the container. She barely gets half way and then puts fruits on it. Then she just closes it up and it's like 3/4 full. All of those for 8 dollars!? Ripoff! I will never be back again!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!  Did not expect to have authentic Taiwan night market dishes in Las Vegas.  It is even better than the ones in San Francisco Bay Area.  I had Taiwanese meat ball (lots of meat and sauce, thin skin), salt and pepper fried chicken (freshly made, tender), pork intestine thin noodle (quite authentic), mango snow ice (mango + milk shave ice with real big chuck of mangos)."}
{"text":"This review might be a lil late but I just got a yelp account lol anyway I been here 3 times already the food is just so good and affordable  The shave ice! Is my favorite part they serve a large portion and the staff is very friendly I ask her twice for extra condense milk (coz I preferred my shaved ice super sweet) and she pleasantly served me my demands so their food for yourself"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pretty new. It used to serve you free milk tea with your orders. This offer is now gone. We have been there several times and tried most of their foods. We find that the portion was really small and the items were mostly over-priced. The food was pretty good though. The only few items that are worth the money were the Lunch Box with Rice and Taiwan Sausage with Rice. Their rice noodles are not even enough to feed a petite girl like me and it was $6.99 for a tiny plate! Their shaved ice is $7.00! OMG! I would go again for the free milk tea but the offer is not valid anymore so I am not going back there unless they lower the prices. There are way too many good restaurants in Las Vegas with a lot larger portions! Hopefully they get to read my review and revise either the Portion or the Price!"}
{"text":"Great food and experience! Such nice people and service was great! Small and friendly Lil place good for a date or even a family. The pork belly was delicious and the soups are very unique. To top it off, mango shaved ice!!!"}
{"text":"I live in NJ, but visit Vegas often to see family.  The Little Kitchen Cafe is convenient to the airport, so after I land I always stop in and get a bite to eat.  I love this place.    I used to live in Taiwan for two years and the food here is as I remembered it in Taiwan.  We usually order the 'salt & pepper chicken' and the pork chop.  I love their shaved ice as well.  I think anything on their menu will be good.  Have also had the won ton soup which was really good.  Living in NJ there are plenty of good restaurants and I also frequent Flushing, NY where the restaurans are also very good.  However, I think this is my favorite place.    The owner is very nice and makes you feel welcome.  She is very busy since the restaurant always has quite a few customers.    Can't wait to go back to visit family so I can stop in and have some more great food."}
{"text":"Excellent service and decent food. I would recommend the pork bun and also soy bean curd dessert. Will return!"}
{"text":"Large portions. I had the wonton soup. I had 1/2 left over. They even gave me extra soup to fill up my togo container. LOW price. $8  Small restaurant with only 5 tables/booths. Only con was it took while to refill my water."}
{"text":"I can say this is one of the best Taiwanese place in Vegas. Nice lady with friendly service. Food is authentic, comparable to the ones in LA. Great Taiwanese gem in Vegas !"}
{"text":"Meh is all I can say about this place. They sell Taiwanese food but not very authentic. Nobody put cabbage in ?????Nlt sure what it's about. We also order salt and pepper chicken and that was ok. Hubby ordered braised beef rice and it didn't look appetizing. We will not come back."}
{"text":"The food is worth the drive...definitely better then most  Asian food you find on the strip, the owner is nice and she helps you with the menu and points out there special dishes...the shaved ice was one of the best  I've had in awhile..if your in Vegas and have a car you need to check them out...check out my pictures"}
{"text":"Love the Little Kitchen!! Came here with a friend and tried the Seafood Soup (they added veggies on request--it was all amazing), Salt and Pepper chicken with rice (perfectly crispy and just the right amount of seasoning and bite size pieces accompanied by three types of pickled veggies that were delicious) and Minced Pork with noodle (the noodles here are exceptional in taste and texture). Small place, very warm and friendly staff, excellent service, variety in menu and very good price point for portions--we had leftovers. We will be back. This is a must-dine in Chinatown.  Especially for foodies!!!! Little Kitchen is a noodle lovers paradise!"}
{"text":"I was writing my first review while I was waiting for my order. Here is the latest, and most updated one.  It's only my second time here. The first time, my friend treat me for some shaved ice. I LOVED it because she asked for extra milk and even told us that if we need more, all we need is ask.  I tried it the second time, by myself, and ordered the same exact thing. I asked for extra milk, and they gave me just a little. The second time I ask, the guy gave me a small platter of nothing but condensed milk. He told me that it's $.50 extra! I was like WTF!  I was expecting the same experience I had the first time, that's why I came back. But since they're very shady, I WONT be coming back no more!   What a shame."}
{"text":"Went to this place without looking at reviews here as I was in a hurry to grab some lunch. Ordered the fried chicken bits and rice (????) as well as stinky tofu(???). Both tasted great. The chicken was so tender in fact it was the most tender fried chicken bits I've ever tasted. There are also 4 different side dishes (??) under the chicken with rice that tasted refreshing when you mix all of them together with rice. The stinky tofu is crispy on the outside and tender inside, though usually I want my stinky tofu to be more stinky but it tasted very good. The dipping sauce for stinky tofu tasted great(it's got garlic in it so if you want fresh breath tell them not to put garlic in the dipping sauce)"}
{"text":"I had the pork intestine noodles, and it was amazing. Almost as good as I had in Taiwan, minus the baby oysters. Price was a tad high for the portions, in San Jose same dish was only 5 bucks as opposed to 9 here. Place was packed, they actually asked people sitting around to leave, not sure how I would feel of that happened to me. Came here instead of the taiwanese place 2 shops to the right because they didn't take card."}
{"text":"Came to visit and was closed and the timd was set at midnight was very disappointed with this place a lot of people say it was not so good but had to come try it my self and was closed"}
{"text":"Very bad experience. No taste, very slow, almost no service, waited very long for a noodle, and kind of pricy"}
{"text":"This cozy family owned venue gives u an authentic insight of everyday Taiwanese cuisine. I spent a lovely summer in Taiwan and I was longing for refreshing winter-melon tea while having hot wonton soup. I also had the red bean shaved ice. I really liked the decor of this place, it's tiny with an open kitchen so you can see what they're making. The ordering process is self service in the sense you mark what you want on a paper and just hand it to the server. All in all great flavors, service wasn't that great because it was busy but it's still worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly solid option for this plaza- I know it's chinatown, but most of the dining options seem to be hit or miss for me. Prices are fairly low, portions are fairly good. Stick to the rice plates (pork chop is my favorite, has great flavor), haven't tried the noodle soups yet. The pork bun and chili oil wontons are okay for add-ons, but I've had better. Takeout orders are ready quick. Dining in is not my preference, as service is minimal and dining room usually needs some attention."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch as I heard it's a great place to grab a quick bite.  The place was crowded but lucky they had a table for me very quickly. I ordered two items on the menu which were the famous intestine food and the Chinese meat ball.  The Intestine soup came quickly.  The meatball I guess was just taking awhile. So, I sat there.. Waiting.  Waiting. The lady who seemed like she owned the place came by twice to see if I got mine and she yelled to the back.. About the meatball.  Nope. Saw a new table get seated next to me ten minutes later.  They ordered something. Then saw one of the staff member bring over their meatball. I was really annoyed at that.   Finally I just asked for the check.  Then the lady came by and said \"so you want me to wrap it up for you to go?\"    No. I do not want you to wrap it up for me to go!  You forgot about my dish. She didn't offer any compensation.  No discount for forgetting. Horrible especially when you over look a dish and I only had two. And then you try to sell me to take it home after 25 min sitting and waiting. I had already finished my first dish a while ago and I just sat there.   Then she told me(in Chinese), well you can come by next time to order that dish. You can pay for it then!  We just saved you some money today!\"  No. I will not be back to order your meatball lady."}
{"text":"We had Sam Woo the night before and wanted to eat something different. We looked at the pictures of the food posted outside and this lady comes out and tells us to come in.  As we were eating the lady does this to many customers looking at the pictures and they all come in.  I am thinking she is the owner.  I ordered the fried chicken over rice. It was okay.  I loved the pickled veggies and soy sauce egg that comes with it though.   My sister ordered the Taiwanese sausage over rice and she loved it.  My mom ordered the won ton soup.  The broth was good, but the won tons were not."}
{"text":"Minced pork on rice was somewhat authentic. But some of our order never came even after 3 reminders in an empty restaurant.  Would rather go to the  2 surrounding restaurants."}
{"text":"They actually closed out. The restaurant next door bought them out I think. And their take on the original menu is AWEFUL! I loved this place and been their regular for the past 5 yrs. What a shame"}
{"text":"Very authentic Taiwanese food, speedy service, although the restaurant is kind of small, but feeling very warm. Waitress and waiter are very friendly. Their menu has picture always +++"}
{"text":"Definitely authentic tawainese dishes! Small restaurant with only a few seats but the homely feel and great, tasty dishes makes it all worthwhile. Pork dishes, meatballs and soups all tasted like home cooking."}
{"text":"Awesome traditional Taiwanese delicacies!  The soft tofu dessert (??) is one of the best I've tasted, and I'm from L.A. The pork intestine thin noodle soup is also great.  They marinated the intestine and that just shows they really do follow the tradition.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"4 people, $70. Not worth it.  I come to vegas almost annually and these restaurants change frequently. Simply put: They have taiwanese food, bad taiwanese food. There were four of us and we ordered 2 of the same things, and 2 different dishes. Portions were too small and taste was only average.  My noodles came out really quick.....the other same order of noodles didn't come out until everything else came out. Everything else including dishes that came out and were taken back and then brought back out again because the order was confused. when eating the noodles, there were a ton of corn starch clumps in both bowls. Corn starch is an ingredient, not a garnish. We were actually told that after my bowl came out they ran out so thanks for telling me i got the old soup and they were making a fresh pot.  Here's the temperature problem. It was only about 10 degrees higher in the restaurant than it was outside. So if you're looking to sweat like a pregnant nun and overpay, proceed. I wouldn't be surprised if they were gone by our trip next year."}
{"text":"If you read my original review you may have read some humorous venting. I'm playing nice so I removed the first paragraph :)  Located in the main part of Chinatown, the same plaza as 99 Ranch Market but more to the center near Mother's Korean Grill. There isn't a big sign but if you're passing by you may run into an elderly Asian woman inviting you in. The service and entrees were good, I had no complaints. But you'll probably stop by mainly for their desserts. Their cold and very tasty shaved snow. Besides Frost Bites Shavery which is changing their name to SnowFlake Shavery!? this is probably the only other place in Vegas I'd highly recommend for shaved snow treats.  They have a bunch of combinations of flavors of shaved snow and toppings  I had the peanut with boba, matcha with red bean, mango with mango, blue berry with condense milk, taro with taro, and I think mango with mango love them all and more than some.  Their servings for shaved snow are big and inexpensive. Check out the pictures I know you want some now too.  I guess all 13 of us who wrote a review for this business listing don't know anything better."}
{"text":"This place has gone way down hill the last 2 times I've been here. Their menu has shrunk down to a single page, but their food quality has gone way down. The food is now really bland and for being a Taiwanese spot, they should be embarrased to mess up on something like popcorn chicken! Their service is crap too. Ask them to prep something a certain way or to not add in certain ingredients and they will say \"no problem\" and then when the dish arrives, there's a problem because they didn't honor those requests! When you ask them if they could re-make the dish they'll ask first if you can try it to make sure. WTF kind of service is this? I already told multiple servers and they all acknowledged that it would be no problem. So will I be back here? No, and I sure as hell wouldn't recommend them to anyone else."}
{"text":"They don't turn on the ac. Instead, they use a ghetto fan to cool the entire restaurant.  The service is horrible. Instead of making sure each table is okay, they would rather chat amongst themselves. If you plan on asking multiple times for napkins or other stuff, then come here. Even if they do remember to give napkins, they'll only give you one or two. They got our order wrong multiple times. Even when they were taking our order, they were impatient in waiting for us to decide what we wanted.  Do not order any kind of rice dish. Also, do not order any kind of boba drink. In summary, do not come here to eat.  Bad service, lousy food, and no ac."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing only the shaved ice. We got there at 8:30pm and they're already out of all flavored shaved ice except Green Tea but only for one serving left. For 3 toppings and small amount of green tea cost us $9.75 (very expensive ) and it was not even good... And they forgot the condensed milk (which we charged for it)"}
{"text":"Portions are TINY! I dined here a couple of times over the past few years and every time I go the portions get smaller as the prices get higher. I'm really disappointed and will not be back. Don't know if there was a change in management, but I hope they go back to the way it was 2 years ago."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 2 times already. The first time I went was last month and it was decent. Not good, but not bad. I decided to take my parents there and give this place another chance.. And I regret it!  We ordered:  Sticky rice cupcake- it was literally MICROWAVED for too long. Yes .. I said microwaved. The rice had became dry and crunchy! Gross..  Sesame noodles: it was okay, I've had better.  Pork stew over rice: it was probably the only good thing we ordered..  Stinky tofu: they took 30min or more making it... Half the batch was freshly fried and half was old (they tried to re fry it to hide the oldness)   Anyways, i wont be back...another disappointing Taiwanese place. I'll rather go to tea station.."}
{"text":"Located in the Chinatown Plaza.  The strawberry-mango shaved snow just hit the spot!"}
{"text":"We are visiting for few days. Wish Yelp would update that the place is currently closed(there's a sign that says they're remodeling). Bummer. Out of all fancy places to eat in Vegas i was mostly looking forward to eat here (came here last year). They have all the comfort Taiwanese food such as meatball, stinky tofu, braised pork rice, meat noodle stews"}
{"text":"Good food. Nothing special. Simple very reasonably priced food. I ordered the minced pork over rice and the chili wontons. I wanted to order the shaved ice with the pudding on top but was in a rush and forgot. Service is like a fast food restaurant. God came very quickly. It's a small restaurant with seating for about 25 at most?  Would definitely come back again.   The only down side is the minced pork was a bit too minced. The half of an egg provided was over cooked. Would like to try other dishes next time."}
{"text":"Very authentic Taiwanese food. Simple but great! Small place with great personal service. Highly recommended for someone craving Taiwanese hometown food."}
{"text":"I have be in vegas almost every month,  from LA this is a traditional taiwanese food,  everything taste so much Better especially pork chop and noodles ,   Recommand pork chop rice Or noddles   Wontonsoup , shave Ice,  drinks ,    Very clean fast family restaurant , and the price is so much cheaper than others at that plaza    Good place to eat , food Comes Out very fast with quality  , go give it a try , freshly made food taiwanese food !!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place when we couldn't find something we wanted to eat and was open late. The Little Kitchen is a small restaurant with limited seating. It sells Taiwan dishes, shaved ice, and drinks.  My husband is from the island of Taiwan and whenever he finds a place that sells the Taiwanese food we have to try it out. My husband is a fan of the Taiwanese meatball. It is small dish with an outside coated with a translucent dough and a meatball inside. It is hard to find a place that makes this special dish correctly or even at all. He tried it and we had to come back two days in row.    One of the things I would change is to make the dessert menu in English and Chinese. It is hard to order if you can't read in Chinese but, you can use the photos to choose what you want to try out. The shaved ice is really good. It is soft and melts in your mouth. It is not icy as I have tried other places in the past.  The condensed milk along with the pudding is great.   The portions of the shaved ice are large compared to what you would find in the San Francisco Bay Area.     If this place were opened closer to home we would be regulars."}
{"text":"I would probably give this as 3.5 stars but I'm feeling nice so I will round up to 4 stars. The server was really nice (and super Taiwanese in mannerisms).   I got the chili oil wontons. I really like them at Din Tai Fung so I was hoping for something similar. The flavor was okay, good but not super divine.  The hibiscus tea (Luo Shen hua cha) was a lively reddish pink color and not super sweet."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, but the whole plaza seems very empty. Don't live here so don't know if this is normal. This restaurant had no one in there so we were a little concerned, but all the food photos outside were very yummy looking so decided to give it a try.  We ordered the stinky tofu, pork noodles (ruo gun mein), and pork chop rice. Since we were the only customers in there the whole time, service is good and food came quickly. The waitress (owner?) is very friendly too. All 3 dishes taste good. The pork chop rice came with some cooked veggies and 2 kinds of pickled veggies, as well as minced meat/sauce over the rice. Very yummy and a good sized portion. The pork noodles is tasty too, seems to have sacha sauce in there which is unexpected, but it's tasty so we didn't mind. The stinky tofu tastes pretty authentic too. I also had the plum tea, which had a good amount of tea flavor and I enjoyed it.  Did not regret coming in! Writing the review a few hours later and it's getting me hungry again!"}
{"text":"For me, Taiwanese Food is a fusion between Korean and Chinese food. Unfortunately I prefer either Korean or Chinese to Taiwanese. The flavors in Taiwanese are a bit off beat for this American palette. Notwithstanding my personal tastes, The Little Kitchen is clean and friendly and does a good job!"}
{"text":"The wonton soup was lukewarm and the taiwanese sausage has too much fat in them. Other than that its a quick place to try taiwanese food."}
{"text":"Good authentic Taiwanese restaurants. We order the beef noodle soup and pork belly rice. The pork belly rice was cooked perfectly and not very oily mixed with pickle vegetable it was perfect you can also order small side dish on the side with your meal!  Will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"True to its name, The Little Kitchen Cafe is a petite place in Chinatown. I have the impression that it's a family owned/operated place.  It offers a variety of items: the fried rice noodle and the meatball soup are good. Seafood noodle is somewhat bland. The stinky toku is below par. Service is what I expected of a small and busy Joint.  Oveall it's OK for a Taiwanese deli."}
{"text":"I love taiwanese food, and coming from l.a. I get the chance to try all yummy taiwanese food that I want. This restaurant is awesome!  Reminds me of places like old country cafe. I only had their taiwanese sausage but Ah so good! Also the staff was really nice and lastly I'm gonna make sure to become a regular when I come to visit my gf!"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a place here in Las Vegas that serves an AUTHENTIC pork belly bao (bun) with all of the fixings on top. There are many \"asian fusion\" type restaurants in town that have them on their menu as appetizers (seems to be the new fad) but they are not authentic Taiwanese. Another place that I found that is close in authenticity is Fat Choy inside of the Eureka casino... Just a little far for me. But I finally found the place!! And it's called Taiwan deli! Who would've thought?   The pork belly is braised perfectly with soy sauce and topped with pickled radishes, mustard greens, cilantro, and crushed peanuts and drizzled with hoisin sauce. SO GOOD. The bao is soft and fluffy; just the way it should be.   I also tried the salt and pepper popcorn chicken and it is legit. Fried with basil and tossed with the Chinese 5 spice seasonings. Must try!  I will definitely be coming back to try the stinky tofu and chili oil wontons!"}
{"text":"Excellent shave ice! Thin and melts in your mouth like snow!"}
{"text":"Good Taiwanese shave ice. Their toppings are similar to the ones I've had in Taiwan. I didn't get to try some of my favorites because they were out of a lot that I wanted. But it was still really good and exactly what we needed because its so damn hot here! The price is average. Not the cheapest but you won't go broke eating here. Really small shop and uncomfortable seats so don't go there with a big group. The staff is friendly and attentive. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Ordered the minced pork rice dish and seafood noodle bowl. The taste and flavor was sub-par but delivered with good service. Atmosphere is casual and restaurant is small."}
{"text":"Great place if you are getting small plates (asian tapas) to share.  Try the won ton soup, reminded me of Taiwan and my mom's cooking.  Meat Ball (Ba Wan) is pretty good but not like Taiwan, of course, but pretty good for Vegas.  Made fresh and probably not the frozen types that you see in LA."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing and I am so glad I discovered this while walking around Chinatown in search of Taiwanese food. It's a bit crowded at night (around 8 or 9 pm) but the environment is very cozy. I highly recommend this place if you're craving Taiwanese little eats (xiao chi)!! The dishes they make are very flavorful and well-done in general.  Stinky tofu is a dish I always get at every Taiwanese restaurant (if they have it), so I have tried some from the 'bleh' range to the 'best' in Taiwan. The tofu they serve here is crispy, juicy, and not too stinky! It's not bad~ however, the pickled cabbage on the side wasn't too great.  The manager actually walked around to greet everyone as well, which I found very welcoming. I'll be coming here every time I visit the strip!"}
{"text":"Do not be fooled by the name, this place is called Four Seasons Diner as it shares the same space. The place is complete garbage with service so bad your dog can do better. I could not even finish the ramen as it was that horrible. The meat tastes bland, the egg with it is cold, the food took so long to come out the water in the tea pot got cold. But actually, the water in the tea pot was never hot to begin with, straight room temperature tap water.   I rarely write 1 stars, all i got to say is dont waste your time, dont come here, save your money."}
{"text":"this place is the worst. the worst Taiwanese food I have had and not cheap. I don't understand how they got 3.5 stars. this place ruined my first day on Vegas trip.."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 star.  Earl and I came in for dinner last night, and we literally went around the neighborhood 3 times before finding it.  First of all, the address is 4215 vs. 4250.  It is located next to Mother's Korean Grill, inside the shopping square where you see 99 Ranch Market.  I had to make the call to confirm the address.  Anywho, when we got there, we were seated promptly.  With the recommendation of the lady owner/cook, we got the won ton noodle soup, pork chop rice, and crispy chicken roll.  She doesn't speak English very well, but she point point and with the help of another gentleman that works there, we made our decision.    -won ton noodle soup: clean broth, the won tons are deliciously handmade.  I don't care for the noodles. -pork chop rice: underneath the tender pork chop slices, there are minced pork.  The boiled egg was over boiled so it was super dry.  It comes with picked mustard greens and kim chi. -crispy chicken roll: our favorite of the evening.  The roll was slightly crisp on the outside, and flavorful in the inside.  This also came with kim chi.  You get salty, sweet, and tangy with this order.  When we requested for the check, the lady owner asked \"No ice?\"  I said no because we are full.  Though, $7ish for a small bowl of ice doesn't sound like a valuable deal.     The meal cost us $24.  Overall, we think it's a decent place for decent Taiwanese food."}
{"text":"It was bad experience, first they lost our order sheet, kept us waiting for almost an hour, then took order again, but forgot 2 dishes and had to take order 3rd time, still could not figure out what missing and what already served on the table, also they run out of one soup we ordered, but did not let us know. Really really bad experience, they don't know how to run a resturant."}
{"text":"This little kitchen understands the concept of Tawainese fast food perfectly. Cheap small eats. I prefer picture menus over extended verbiage anyday.  Pork bun taco thing was delish. Perfect appetizer to a bowl of dumpling noodles. Taiwanese broth mmMmm. Mini meatballs inside slurpy skin mmmMmmm. Lots and lots of bokchoy and green onions yes!!  My sister got extra noodles. They give you alot of extra noodles. Dad had the pepper fried chicken nuggets - super crispy and very flavorful. Mom got the traditional noodles, which had a lighter broth and equally amazing.  We also ordered this glutinous gelatin thing with meaty insides. Spicy and chewy, but difficult to eat. Never seen this before.. not sure what to make of it.  Super friendly service, but it might be beacuse we are chinese. We chatted with the staff about not having a hotel for the night, and she tried hooking us up with one of her peeps. Legit."}
{"text":"Please note, I have not tasted the food here.  I would have LOVED to taste the food, which is why I came to the establishment.  They advertise that they close at midnight.  We showed up at 11:15pm and we're turned away since they were closing.  Please correct me if I'm wrong, but 11:15 pm is NOT midnight.  My pregnant wife was disappointed.  So we sought an alternative location that stayed open until midnight as advertised.  What a shame.  :("}
{"text":"OMG, this place is a rip off The food is definitely not Taiwanese and don't believe the pictures on the wall. The food that comes out are totally different. It's salty, greasy & not cooked by Taiwanese chef. I don't think they have repeat customers. Only the out of towners like us that doesn't know better would go there. You'll be sorely disappointed"}
{"text":"My wife said the pork mince rice is the best one she had in her life , she ate this dish in hundreds of places  !! Also The sour and spicy soup is better than I expected ! Thank you everyone in this little kitchen ! Really good food."}
{"text":"Small little mom and pop shop,  good service, food just average.   Service is very attentive and they will do whatever they can to please you.   In fact,  if you are sick and need a kidney,  check here for a match.   Food however is a bit on the bland side.  My kids had the pork chop rice,  which was bland.  Even the sour pickled greens were bland.  I had the pork stew noodle.  It was also bland.  As a side i also had the stinky tofu...don't judge me...and shockingly...it was bland,  as was the sauce on the side.   On the positive side if you have high blood pressure and shouldn't eat too much salt...this might be a good place for you."}
{"text":"I attended Tony T.'s UYE here last night and we enjoyed the food a lot.  We shared 7 main dishes and 5 shaved snow desserts.  The winning dish for me last night was the salt and pepper fried chicken.  The dish was salty and it was somewhat spicy from the cayenne like pepper sprinkled on the chicken pieces.  It was terrific.  The Taiwanese style sausage and minced pork with rice were very good.  In addition, the cuttlefish noodle soup was also very enjoyable. I had one of the spicy wontons and it was good but the spice level was low, not really very spicy.  For dessert, we had ordered 5 different kinds of snow ice and they brought each flavor to us one at a time which we then spooned into our dishes.    Going with a group like this was perfect!  We got a chance to taste a lot of food.  Going alone or with another person would limit what you could try because the portions are large.    Service was very good and the owners of the small restaurant were very accommodating.  Having Tony T. there was a big plus because he could explain some of the dishes to us and his conversant Chinese helped with the ordering process.  I'll be returning.  I have to have my own order of salt and pepper chicken."}
{"text":"We were looking to grab lunch in the area, and came across this Taiwanese restaurant on Yelp. The large counter, tiled floors, open kitchen, TV, and a handful of small tables summed up the small interior. We were the only customers throughout the entire time, so there wasn't much of an atmosphere to report.   The paper menu came as a checklist of Taiwanese street food and old country flavors. I initially wanted the Taiwanese Pork Intestine Noodles ($7.99), but they were out and waiting for the ingredients to arrive from California. Instead, we ordered the Rice Cupcake ($4.50) where the wet, mushy sticky rice had already fell apart by the time it reached our table. Our server didn't seem to care whether we noticed the sloppy presentation. The other peculiar aspect of this dish was the red sauce. It was not supposed to be tomato based, but resembled ketchup.   The Taiwanese Meat Ball ($3.99) came with a very good glutinous exterior. The thickness, and firm chewy qualities was spot on along with the embedded ground pork. However, the Meat Ball also came with the same ketchup sauce, which ruined the experience.  Finally, the Minced Pork Rice Noodles ($6.99) came with ground pork and hard boiled egg that didn't carry the deep stewed flavors. Equally subpar was the broth that tasted like water.   Service was friendly, but the experience was so lackluster that we didn't care to stay for shaved ice or other desserts. In short, I rather eat at other mediocre Taiwanese restaurants than this one. It was not worth the visit."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious! I love coming here whenever I'm craving for Taiwanese food. It's cheap and you get a pretty decent size meal.   They have a variety of noodles and rice dishes. I usually go for the rice dishes just because I feel more satisfied with the serving. It comes with your choice of meat as well as a seasoned tea egg and three sides of veggies. Their snow is also worth trying! If you have room for desserts, definitely try either the Strawberry or the Fresh Fruit. The size is good for about 2-3 people depending on how hungry y'all are.   You will occasionally find one of the employees standing outside to drive in customer. It may be intimidating at times but they're just doing you a favor so you won't pass up this great experience!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place 3 times. And it went from 3 star to 2 star and finally stayed at 2 star.   First of all, severely over-prized. Average dish price is around $7 if not more. The portion are small. Initially, it gets a 3-star for a good shaved ICE that is not available in the entire valley of Las Vegas, and the only similar shaved ice can only be found in southern California. This is the highlight of their dish.   However, their hot dishes are average at the most. Over priced and portion very small. Having taste buds that is spoiled by authentic stuff in southern california and Los angeles, this place will be out of business within few weeks if it were there. However, rarity survives and unfortunately there is not competition in vegas.   That being said, a few things that really upset me. Most of all is their pricing. A few examples are: Their pig ears and all the \"small appetizer plates\" that they have in the fridge are a total rip off at $5 a dish. I can get those less than $3 in any other decent place. I don't know if they're paying for the expensive rent at the location. The spicy Wonton has 8-9 pieces of wonton in a very small place for a costly price, that was the most ridiculous dish. The crispy chicken rice is decent, but again, over-priced. Taiwanese sausage rice is not bad, but again, overpriced. I've tried most of their dishes before I wrote this review, and it's sad because being one of the few Taiwanese cuisines, they have so much potential but completely screwed it up. I'm going to say I will not go back there again.   Word of advice: With the price you have to pay, you might as well go next door to decent Japanese Restaurants, or all you can eat sushi, or even tea station next door.   Overall, it is very disappointing."}
{"text":"Authentic Taiwanese food. Highly recommend bringing someone that at least speaks Chinese or Taiwanese with you. :)"}
{"text":"A reasonable size of each dish! Also delicious. Great service provided and the waitress pointed out gravity fee was added in the total fee to alert the customers. Will come back if arrive at LV again!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for a quick bite to eat. There was 2 of us. This is a small restaurant almost a quick service restaurant as you check the box on the menu for what you want to order.   Food came out really fast as this place is so small of a place they want quick turning of tables I guess.   I had the pork feet noodles and it was very good with it not being so oily as some dishes that contain pig feet gets.   I will keep going back for more as there are a few items that looks really good. And the prices are really cheap for what ingredients they use."}
{"text":"Delicious!"}
{"text":"This was one of the few places without a line on a Friday night in the Chinatown plaza. One of the owners? was really nice and helpful. One of the dishes we wanted wasn't available, so she said that she would go grab it, it's just in a freezer off site. After we finished the meal, we asked another waitress if it was coming. She told us that they were out of that dish. so I said that the other lady said she would go get it. The waitress responded that the other lady did go get it, but we'd need to wait for it to defrost. Hmmm, I wish they would have said something to us. So we just cancelled the order.  The rest of the food was disappointing. But at least service was quick and there wasn't a line."}
{"text":"This was a little place.  There were customers crowed around little tables.  They were located on Spring Mountain Rd/Arville St next to Mr Sandwich in Chinatown.  The waitress handed me a paper menu, like a sushi menu that you mark.  The menu was limited and didn't have descriptions of the food.  I wasn't really familiar with Taiwanese food.   They need a website, but have a Facebook page.  The waitress was very friendly, but I never saw her again until the bill came at the end of my meal.  I wanted a fork, but could never flag down a server.  I ordered the Won Ton Noodle.  It turned out to be a soup.  There were about 5 flavorful won tons topped with baby bok choy and scallions.  The noodles were chewy.  The broth was tasteless.  The jar of hot pepper sauce was almost empty and needed to be wiped down.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"First of all, this place spells chicken, \"chichen\".  Anyway.   The food was mediocre. It was so bland and took forever. Their pepper and salt chicken tasted literally like ass....  They also kept their restaurant EXTREMELY hot. The restaurant was definitely warmer than the outside night of Las Vegas...which is saying a lot. I tried to eat, but I had to get up and go because I was SO uncomfortable with how hot it was inside this place.  Their prices are also freaking ridiculous... too expensive for bland food that aint even good!"}
{"text":"I was craving some Taiwanese food and came across this place while searching through Yelp. It is located in Chinatown which I frequently visit for food/drink when in Vegas. It was pretty empty when we got there around 2 PM on a Saturday. The service was good but I it's hard not to be attentive when you are one of three people in the restaurant.   We got one pork bun sandwich. The pork was pretty flavorful and topped with cold pickled veggies inside of a soft white bun. It was pretty pricey for what it was but pretty good.   My boyfriend and I also shared a Salt and Pepper Chicken with rice. The portion size was pretty big. It came with pickled cabbage and veggies that went well with the chicken and rice. There was also minced pork under the chicken to go with the rice as well."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. Place was packed. I had the Taiwanese meatball. Not bad but overpriced. It was some kind of stretchy wonton with bbquey sauce and cilantro group pork in the middle. Also had the salt and pepper chicken. It was okay as was the taiwanese sausage. Nothing spectacular here but next time I'm having some noodle seafood soup and maybe try sole of the desserts because everyone else's looked so good. I was starving after a 16 hr.day and wanted something different ....I definitely got different haha. Place was very busy but service was right on top of it and they never let my drink go empty."}
{"text":"We got our food right away. Very excellent very fast. We had Pork Chop, Wonton Soup, Braised Pork and Spicy Wonton for $29+tax really good pricing and everything was really good. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Minced pork over rice was excellent. So was my friend chicken over rice.  Marinated egg that came with the dinner plate was one of the best I remember. So are the generous serving of vegetable side servings. Satisfying and delicious. And best of all they take credit card with no minimum charges"}
{"text":"Very Authentic Taiwanese Restaurant. People from Cali, please don't complain about the price. I think the price is fine. I know it is couple dollars higher than the price in LA for the same food. But for a local Las Vegan, it is reasonable.  I tried pretty much all of the dishes and just one word. \" Great\"   The downside is that it is in China Town and I live 30 miles always from the location so I cannot go there often.  But if I am craving for Taiwanese food, this is the only  one of few places I would go in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had a bowl of wonton soup and the pork chop rice. The soup is flavored OK but the wontons were really tiny. The pork chop rice was below average. As with any pork chop rice there are sides that comes with it. The side of vegetable actually came straight out of the refrigerator so it was ice cold. Now I understand that some vegetables especially Chinese side dishes are served straight out of the refrigerator but you do not serve stirfried Napa cabbage that way.  I don't think I will be visiting this establishment again."}
{"text":"Mama (she is Taiwanese btw) and I were quite disappointed. This could have been good.   You order your food by marking the paper strip.   Both of our noodles lacked flavor, despite looking as if they were packed. My soup was not hot either! My biggest pet peeve. How can all my toppings get warm if my soup isn't hot?  We tried to order the meatball as well, but they were sold out (early afternoon is too early to sell out!).  Will there ever be a good Taiwanese restaurant in Las Vegas? :("}
{"text":"service was great for us. took a taxi from the strip to eat here for a quick fix of taiwanese food. the food was pretty authentic. price is cheap portions are big. if ur in the chinatown area its definitely worth it"}
{"text":"Great little place with small Taiwanese dishes. I ordered the pig knuckles noodles (the non-Asians of my party hasn't arrived in town yet so I figured I'd get it out of the way) and the salt and pepper chicken. Both were great. The noodles were great, the broth was great too. Staff was really nice. It's a bit hard to find, the signage is mostly in Chinese and it's got a small storefront. Great place for a simple little meal."}
{"text":"So really 3.5 stars for me....  The good: 1. Tasty braised pork and minced pork with a nice mix of veggies and pickled veggies. 2. Peanut snow ice with egg pudding was a surprisingly good combo. The fluffy snow ice is good....but not the best I've had. 3. Pork belly sandwich/bao (per friends) minus the sweet sour sauce inside.  The bad: 1. Poor organization....they had to come back to our table to tally dishes afterwards since they had a few items not on the menu and seemed to forget to bring some of our dishes...but we were a party of nine. 2.  Mango with a funny taste in the snow ice....I stopped eating after one piece and made note to the owner. 3. Portion size is too small for the minced pork rice....carnivores beware! If you like meat order the pork chop rice, much better value for your money. 4. Confusing menu with not enough explanation for us ABCers or illiterate Chinese.  The okay: 1. They brought out a new snow ice after I mentioned the funny mango taste.  I had asked for the mango snow minus the fresh mango but what came out was the peanut snow ice instead.....the lady working there is a little bit of a food nazi.  She also picked the replacement dish for my friend...well he sort of got bullied since she was rapidly speaking Mandarin and pointing and he didn't understand so he just ended up nodding his head.... 2.  They brought out a sample of the sticky rice cupcake for my friend who was bullied since they finished cooking it later on in our meal...and that's what he originally ordered.  FYI - same owner as the old Noodle Pot a few stores down...they apparently sold that restaurant and opened this one.  The AC works but is not very strong....I think past reviews regarding no AC were not a personal choice by the owners but rather the AC was not working in the stores in the plaza since Mr. Sandwich had the same issue around that time."}
{"text":"Delicious traditional Taiwanese food very home style food awesome tasty food and great service the place to eat home style cooking you must try"}
{"text":"3 stars for flavor .. total damage was $15 for two items, which is kinda pricey for Taiwanese food compared to San Gabriel Valley.  One of the few foods I ate while on my excursion to Vegas needed to be good. I love Taiwanese food, so why not? I got two things, the chili oil wontons, and stinky tofu.  Chili oil wontons - these tasted all right. They weren't as flavorful and oily as A&J Restaurant (Irvine, CA), but they were okaay. It tasted very fresh, and the flavors were bright, but nothing really stood out for me on this. The oil itself wasn't spicy at all really and didn't really stick to the wontons themselves. It was more of a dipping sauce I guess..   Stinky tofu - This is probably best shareable. Compared to that one place in Rowland Heights (can't remember, sorry), the stinky factor isn't totally pungent. It had the stinky element yes, but it wasn't bad. These I enjoyed more than the wontons I think. The tofu however, when you bite in, seemed to have more holes in it than actual tofu. Wha?  The service is kinda whatever. The guy got my order wrong and almost gave me something that I didn't order, and insisted that I had ordered it. They never really checked up on me but that's cool, it's not like I need someone to talk to during my meal lol  $15 for two things that were okay makes me an ehh panda."}
{"text":"Terrible.   Pork buns bun was left out to dry into hard foam like texture. 5$ for one.   Wonton noodle soup was inauthentic. Used udon noodles and ramen toppings. Also no red vinegar!? 9$  Popcorn chicken was over cooked and bland. 8$ for a sad amount with rice and cold vegetable fillers.   Overpriced, bad tasting food. This place gives Taiwanese food a bad name."}
{"text":"This is the worst Taiwanese food I have had in a while.   If it wasn't for the super enthused pressure grandma hollering at people walking by i wouldn't have dined here.   She begged in taiwanese so I said what the hell I'm hungry anyways.   She sat me and gf at the tightest area by the cashier even tho there are more spacious tables available.  Shit.. Should have walked out right there.   Ordered a fried pork chop rice,  spicy wonton, wonton soup, and sticky rice.     The spicy wonton was not spicy at all but drenched in vinegar.   Sour.   Disgusting. Ding Tai Fung spicy wonton is 1000% better.   The pork chop was the smallest chop I've ever seen.  It was disgraceful.  Its the size of my asian palm divided by 2.  Couldn't believe the waitress handed me the dish.   Tasted ok but the egg and vegetables are super sloppy.   The wonton soup was plain.  I actually tried to wash the spicy wontons with the soup but they were still sour.  Sticky rice was frozen and cold still in the middle and the sauce was overly sour.   Damn..  what is up with the sour!?   I'm from Taiwan and this stuff is really bad.  Meanwhile the grandma lady consistently hover over us while eating and said.. \"delicious huh?   The best u ever had huh?\" In Chinese...   No its the absolute worst I have had but it's the holidays and I didn't want to hurt her feelings.  She is delusional but make a great timeshare sales person because I think she really believes the food is great.   However, you can't talk customers into liking your food no matter how much its marinated with sour feet.  Total was 28 bucks...   I gave a customary 3 dollars tip and wish to never return. Sigh it ruined my first day in Vegas.   Will never eat here again.   A warning for your consideration.   Now I have to go eat somewhere else just to get the nasty out of my mouth."}
{"text":"I'll start off saying I don't know much of Taiwanese food, except what I get in the Taiwan airport when I'm passing thru... With that being said, I thought the food and service here was great!!  The server was very friendly and helpful... Cute too.  I ordered the Braised Pork with Rice and the Pork bun. Soo much more food then I expected, and super fast.  The Braised pork was soo much better then I expected, almost fall apart tender... I'm not use to the brown hard boiled egg, but I liked that also.   The Pork Bun was GREAT.  Tons of amazing flavors.  Whole thing came up to roughly $13. Tons of food and super affordable.  I'll definitely be frequenting here often, considering its close to work."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner. With a friend.   yummy food better than Taiwan  good price  with wifi.  Great for visiter  Check it out."}
{"text":"I am also a native Taiwanese and the food was really terrible.  They served us the sausage rice plate that cost $8.95 with the sausage boiled which tasted like the old Taiwanese shady merchants who tried to filled the sausage with water to cheat customers.  I thought it tasted like raw pork and told the lady and she told me it was boiled and pan fried which is a total lie because I am a chef for over 5 years and it cannot be fried so they lie to me without even making a draft since it should be lightly brown from the cooking and even a 5 year old would know that. The oyster-chitling noodle soup was so under seasoned that I had to add Zheziang vinegar plus some chili sauce to make to taste right which was also a major fail.  I pleaded my case with the server as well as the manager and no apology was offer and gave me an attitude that I don't give a shit.  Thanks for such of experience that I'll remember for a long time."}
{"text":"I love the easygoing feeling that this place comes with. It seems like all the workers get along and are just super at ease with each other which makes me feel more at home as well (i was eating alone and am very uncomfortable having to do that lol)  Proportions are great for the price that you get. they have stinky tofu- come on, can't go wrong with that!!   I'll definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"being a native taiwanese, this place is by far the best in china town and has the best and most authentic cuisine from taiwan one can find in vegas."}
{"text":"Another hole in a wall place. The menu is straight forward. The food is really good! The portions are large.very satisfied with this place."}
{"text":"We thought this place was fantastic. Some of the best Taiwanese food we've had in Vegas for sure. In fact we liked it more than Noodle Pot a few doors down. The salt and pepper chicken was truly amazing. Huge portion size, cooked to order, very authentic and hearty. What set it all off was the nice variety of pickled vegetables that come with it. We always judge a Taiwanese place based on their minced pork and this place did not disappoint. Tender and flavorful. Service was decent enough, the food came out quickly and their prices are very reasonable. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"For those looking for a bit of Taiwanese taste in Vegas, especially southern Taiwanese flavor (Tainan, Kaohsiung area), this is a great place to find it. As the name suggests, the place isn't about big and fancy. It is more about home cooking or comfort food, Taiwanese comfort food, to be exact. I really enjoyed it.  Too bad I was too full.  Otherwise the shaved ice looked pretty good. Definitely something you won't find anywhere on The Stripe. I will return again. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"4 boba teas + + 2 spicy dumplings + 2 rice dishes = $45  In a place where Taiwanese food is not abundant, you can't really complain.  However, coming from the San Gabriel Valley, this is such a ripoff.  The food was ok too.  If you're that desperate for some Taiwanese food, this place would be the place, but I wouldn't really bother."}
{"text":"First of all, just wanted to thank Amanda M for turning me on to The Little Kitchen Cafe, which is a cool little restaurant that serves popular Taiwanese food and desserts.  They have been opened for almost two months, but I must have been avoiding Chinatown Plaza, as I was completely clueless about this new spot to get decent Taiwanese comfort foods and various shaved ice and snow ice desserts.  It is operated by Taiwanese business owner and staff, so it is an authentic Taiwanese restaurant biz.  Most are probably not professional wait staff with years of experience, but they are friendly and courteous.  On my first and currently only visit, I only ordered 3 items, so I still have a lot more of their menu to explore.    1.  Pork Nugget Rice Noodle. This is a popular comfort food in Taiwan, which I usually have at least once when I go back to Taiwan.  The flavor is familiar, and I would say that it is decent, but only because I have tried it from vendors/restaurants that are known for serving the best in Taipei or the entire island country.  But without having to fly across the Pacific or at least driving to Monterey Park, this is not bad.  Portion is large.  Price seems high for the item, but you get a lot of it.  Good for sharing with others family style, so you can try more things.  2.  Pork Crispy Roll - I like the crispy exterior of this roll, but again it is just average appetizer for me. Hitting the best of the best for this item in Taiwan has ruined me!  3.  Milk Snow Ice - correct texture.  Just for that it is already superior to the imitation snow cream at Kuma just down the street, supposedly invented (just like Al Gore invented the Internet) by a local celebrity chef that has since moved himself to SoCal.  Snow Ice (7 flavors), Taiwanese shaved ice, and smoothies plus toppings for dessert. ($3.75 - $7)  --- 7/22/2013 Update--- Went with a group so we could ordered more items to split family style.  They were very accommodating and the food came out pretty fast.  Almost too fast for all the foodies to take pictures of everything we ordered before portioning it out to everyone.  All the rice dishes were served with Taiwanese pickled napa cabbage (similar to the Korean kimchi, but done in a day and without the fermentation process), hard boiled egg simmered in soy, minced pork.  Pork Chop Rice, a traditional bento box offering for travelers back in the days (20-30+ years ago) that were traveling by train or bus across the island.  It was pretty good, and I would order it again.  Taiwanese Style Sausage:  Good, but I prefer it to be cooked a little more for a slightly crispier exterior.  Spicy Wontons - good, but we all agreed that it could be spicier.  Minced Pork over Rice - Very popular Taiwanese comfort food, but also very hard to make really good.  This version is okay.  Salt and Pepper Chicken.  This is the Taiwanese version, and it is more like popcorn chicken with Taiwanese style salt & pepper seasoning.  Fried Rice Noodle.  Another traditional dish that is popular in Taiwan.  This is a good item to order for sharing with a group.  Matcha Shaved Snow + Red Bean.  A traditional flavor combination, and it was decent.  The green tea flavor is not as pronounced as Frost Bites (their version is king).  Peanut Shaved Snow + Boba.  I liked the roasted peanut flavor that was infused into the milk before the mixture was frozen. Boba was alright.  Blueberry Shaved Snow.  Texture was creamier than the rest, almost gelato-like with a \"grape\" flavor.  Nelson Q suggests having this with the Peanut Shaved Ice, to make a PB&J flavor combo.  Taro Shaved Snow + Taro.  Mild taro flavor from real taro and boost from taro powder (that color is just too purple to be all nature), but I think most will agree that this is the only item where people will prefer powder-base flavoring over all natural.  Mango Shaved Snow +Mango.  Pretty good. I like the big pieces of mango, although we had some that were still semi-frozen when this made its way around the table back to us.  Based on the above, I think they get a 3.5 stars.  P.S.  The AC issue mentioned in previous reviews, was resolved by the time of my visit.    P.P.S.  Not friendly for American Express card holders.  And there is a $10 minimum for paying with the credit/debit card."}
