{"text":"Mexx 32 is what I imagine \"Mexican Night\" is in a Caucasian household.  Flavorless OVERPRICED menu items. Nothing anyone ordered in our party seemed to be made with high quality ingredients even though they charge like it is. And $4 for a tiny scoop of sweet pinto beans and a tiny scoop of standard white/brown rice???  And to top it off we had terrible service. I'm pretty sure our server purposely waited 10+ minutes after giving us our water and chips and salsa so that Happy Hour could end so we could not order anything from that menu. Then pulled the same disappearing act much of the rest of our time there."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Good portions as well We had the Caesar salad which was incredibly good and the Mahi Mahi tacos were very good as well"}
{"text":"Hmmmmmmmm.....  Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.....  Yyyyyyyyyeah.  OK, so Sexx32, sorry, I mean...MEXX32...hey it's not my fault you named your glorified bar/happy hour spot after intercourse. What do you THINK people envision when they read Mexx? Anyway, after being UNDERwhelmed recently at this owner's place two doors down, Delux, (Mexx32 and Delux are owned by the same absentee owner) we took our saddles to Mexxx32 because in passing, the space looks ultra-modern/hip and the food looked pretty decent, from afar.  However, once seated...the cooks in the (open) kitchen were goofing around WAY too much. It's disconcerting as your first impression and visual to see rowdy dudes not paying attention to food preparation in the kitchen. And the waitress was just straight-up r-u-d-e. English is my guest's second language and the middle-aged woman \"serving\" us had NO patience for my guest or my guest's questions about drinks and the menu.  We ordered an app and the plate had a sizable gash in it. Just what I want to think about when dipping my chip into a sauce: bits of shattered porcelain. Mmmm, torn stomach lining. I asked for a fresh serving in a new dish and the incredulous waitress looked at me puzzled, as if she KNEW there was no way any dish in Mexxx32 could possibly be broken and in-service. She actually reproached us midway between our table and the kitchen, yelling \"That's not a chip, that's avocado!\" Confused looks by us. Her gaze turns again towards the dish. \"Oh\"...upon looking closer at the broken dish, \"oh it's cracked.\" And she reluctantly retreats to the kitchen.  This is Service 101 and it appears to be a HUGE issue at Mexxx32: don't treat your customers like a scolded child and at least pretend to have patience when someone is visiting your restaurant for the first time and is not familiar with your menu AND is making a first (and last impression). Also: your cooks should act somewhat professionally when in FULL VIEW of the guests.  I haven't done this in a lllllllong time....but we walked before the rest of the food came out. Screw you, Mexxx32; there are a million restaurants in Metro Phoenix and we'll never return to your poorly-managed space."}
{"text":"The first time we went they were so nice and the food was great...says my 10 yr old.  Great food, awesome service! Was able to watch my game and we had our own personal speaker. I really enjoyed the smoked beef brisket burrito, so delicious. Bottomless chips and salsa. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"absolutely horrible service!! since i am dining alone, I went to the bar after sitting there for a few minutes I called for the bartender and said are you still open, in a low voice he said yes we are. He gave me menu which the first one I look at was happy hour and the bartender comment aloud our happy hour has ended. i just want you to see the menu. after sitting awhile the women bartender came and asked if I want chips and salsa (No smile No how are you No friendliness at all ) I comment no thank you. then i sat there for about 3 to 5 min more ready to order no one came by. They were engaged in talking to each other that i felt they really didn't want to wait on me. I got up and used the restroom when I passed the bar they just looked at me so I left. The hostess was nice and hospitable but it stopped there. i left and went to the restaurant a couple of doors down (central Bistro ) and although they were more expensive they had much much better service."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to Mexx 32. The food, service and atmosphere were great. Tessa was our server and she was excellent. Chico is another server, who is a great friend of mine, referred me to the place. He stopped by our table to help w/ recommendations. Guacamole w/ pomegranate seeds was tasty. My gf and I share the Mexx 32 chopped salad w- carne Asada. It came with a fresh basil buttermilk dressing that I loved. Also ordered 3 taco plate w/ 3 different selections. A smoked pork, battered cod and mushroom chipotle w/ creamy rice and black beans. Best flavors I've had in awhile! I will be back for more. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great service. Thank you Felicia!  Happened on this place by accident. Incredible street tacos, creamed rice and the signature cocktail, could drink for days....   Unexpectedly wonderful. Great atmosphere and relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"Better than Revo.  This is Revo remodeled with expanded space and an expanded menu.  The same favorites items from the Revo menu plus more taco options.  The salsas are improved too.  I miss the multicolor/flavor chips though.    I don't drink so cannot comment on the booze."}
{"text":"The cream cheese tamales were delicious. Sides/salsa/margaritas/chips also very good. Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"Explosion of flavors!! We came on a Friday night and our party of three were seated immediately in the bar area (busy in restaurant and bar); great ambiance. Grady was our server and friendly, helpful and willing to give recommendations of personal favorites, attentive to when we needed refills, overall excellent! Now the food: chips and trio of salsas (hot, mild, pico), so yummy! Carne asada rice bowl, delicious flour tortillas; the mahi mahi tacos were unbelievable! Pork burrito--amazing! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. Price point is extremely reasonable and will go again when visiting the area."}
{"text":"I met my daughter for dinner at Mex 32 and experienced a wonderful menu that was surprisingly good for the price. The atmosphere service was perfect the owner personally met and chatted with each guest to make them feel comfortable in his new establishment. A must repeat."}
{"text":"First try.  Excellent food and service. Very nice, clean and comfortable.  Would highly recomend to others!"}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had in a long time!   I waited for over 25 minutes for someone at the bar to take my order to  go.   Their were only three customers in the restaurant at the time, so it was definitely not busy.   I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Open for lunch! Fashionable and cozy, it's an excellent experience with wonderful service. The owner, Lenny, even came to the table to inquire how we were doing. Fresh chips and salsa's began our lunch with a yummy taco and legume/rice sides. Wish we could have enjoyed an adult beverage in the lovely pub but work calls. Next time!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews but as a visitor to the area I could not determine from the website and reviews if this was a nightclub with food or a restaurant with extended hours.  I arrived shortly before 7 p.m. And the crowd was families, dates, and girls and boys nights.  The location was convenient, atmosphere was trendy, service prompt and attentive, and the food was terrific!"}
{"text":"Great staff, fun happy hour vibe, and delicious guacamole!!  Original margarita with salt was perfect!  A new local favorite spot!"}
{"text":"I was presently surprised on my first visit to Mexx32. My dinning experience was right on the mark. I can't remember the last time dinning out where the service was great, the staff friendly, proper potions served at the correct temperature, reasonable prices and very tasty. The décor is unique and put together well with good background music. You can actually have a conversation with out raising your voice. The owner Lenny was there and he visited the tables to speak with the guests to ensure all was as expected.   I made it back to Mexx32 two other times in the following weeks thinking my first visit was a flook being that everything was great. I must say the other two visits were just as pleasant as my first. I had the smoked brisket the 1st time, it was great. The meat was juicy and with a nice light smokey flavor. The other times I had the mahi mahi tacos and the beef tacos. I found my new favorite spot. Ohhhh and the margaritas.... yummy"}
{"text":"I come to this place more times a week than I should probably admit... but it's SO good! First of all, the atmosphere is beautiful with candles and interesting lighting. I also love spending time on the patio. The food is great! Awesome happy hour deals on margaritas and appetizers. I LOVE the creamy rice. I could order a plate of just that."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Traditional high quality mexican food and drink in a trendy upscale environment. Ownership and wait staff are extremely welcoming. Menu is expansive and margsritas match the food quality! Will be coming back soon. Excellent happy hour!"}
{"text":"Just came here tonight for some burritos! Awesome service! They were super attentive to what I wanted and they were speedy! I work at drybar across the street and the girls are always coming here!!  The burritos are a little pricey, but super delicious.  The decor/atmosphere and service makes up it.    Their salsa is to die for!!  The bar chairs were also super comfortable! I could sit there forever.   We will be back!   Yum!!"}
{"text":"The carne asada bowl is absolutely divine. So much so, I may have to eat it daily! Marinated steak grilled to perfection rubbing elbows with guacamole, creamy rice and cheese to create the best bowl I've ever had. Pair it with desert blossom iced tea for lunch and you'll be doing a happy dance all afternoon!"}
{"text":"Love love love. Shredded beef burrito. Creamy rice. Did you read that? CREAMY RICE! Do not deny yourself this delicacy.   Great prices. Awesome location. Dog friendly. Happy Hours. Good chips and salsa. What else could you want? Also...open until 2am? Witchcraft. Wizardry. Magic of some sort. Or maybe just....wonderful"}
{"text":"We tried this place on a whim after driving by. While the atmosphere really drew us in, we were glad we stayed for the food. Per our server's recommendation, we selected the pork, carne asada, cod, and shrimp tacos. Overall, the tacos and drinks were good. Not sure how these tacos compare to others in the Valley (we are new to the area) but we enjoyed them."}
{"text":"If you're hungry for cheese dip, go somewhere else as they don't have it here. They do have a nice creamy white rice. The Mahi taco was yummy but very small. The owner came over and we heads nice chat. The decor is upscale yet relaxed with a nice open patio available."}
{"text":"An excellent dining experience. The ambiance of Mexx 32 is incredible for starters. It reminds me of a lot of the trendy restaurants in San Francisco. The food itself is reminiscent of the old Revo Burrito, but has a more varied flavor. I had the smoked pork burrito which had one of the most authentic smoked flavors I have had. For those looking for Mexican fare in a trendy environment at a reasonable price point, I would highly recommend giving Mexx 32 a try!"}
{"text":"It's a new place and my first time here. The street tacos were awesome! Between my boyfriend and I we tried 6 of them and all were delicious! My personal favorite was the shrimp tinga taco. The chorizo in it was just awesome and added a great compliment. The cocktails are tastey too! I had the North of the Border that was a perfect patio drink.  For dessert, I had the orange cheesecake flan... A-Mazing! The prices of food aren't bad and cocktails are average. I really like the ambience off is place and the cool design. I'm definitely going back with friends. Did I mention they had a patio?   PS. Our server was Celsie and she was great!!"}
{"text":"Mexx32 is the best new hip place to see and be seen.  While true, that statement is far too shallow for the substance that this restuarant provides.  I loved the hatch chile cheese crisp as an appetizer with tasty guac and sour cream.  The shrimp tinga taco is already a favorite of mine...  My buddy loved the carne asada taco saying it was very tender and seemed like it was marinaded all day.  James was our server and he was terrific.  It has a unique style all its own with an open inviting bar with large tv's that can be viewed from every seat in the house.  There's also a cool community table that looks like it was an actual tree.  I prefer the plush high-backed booths that offer privacy to our table and others.  Their menu has a wide variety of choices at a very fair price considering the ambiance and service.  Next time, I'm going to enjoy the nice weather on the patio, as I noticed the heaters were on that night.  I was glad to hear Mexx32 even serves full menu until midnight with an open bar til 2am!  This restuarant has only been open a week, so it has some wrinkles to work out.  Our server told me they'll serve lunch soon too.  .... can't wait to make this restaurant a regular occurrence!"}
{"text":"When this was RevoBurrito it was much better. Fish tacos were the BEST! The old ambiance was much better also. It has become another upscale posh money maker. The tables are so small you can barely fit 2 dinner plates water and a drink and chips without feeling like something will end up on the floor! I used to go there weekly for their fish tacos and now I don't go there anymore because they changed the recipe and they are not good at all. Sad :( used to be my go to place for fish tacos but not anymore :("}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Great vibe, nice food and drinks. Went around 5:30pm. The bar area was full of people having drinks and eating. Service was good and we were seated promptly. Warm Chips and salsa came out right away. The signature margarita is excellent. The guacamole is house made. Tacos were filled with smoked brisket, and the burritos were very filling. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get trendy Mexican food that tastes delicious, in a very cool-looking space to boot. Parking is easy, the patio and inside seating is nice, and I really don't have much to complain about!  I've been here a few times and love the chips and salsas--they are super tasty. I've had a few of the appetizers during happy hour, and the quesadillas are one of my fave choices. When I came here for dinner only, I made the mistake of ordering a SUPER spicy burrito dish without realizing it was spicy, so I didn't each much and can't comment more on that. I will say though, my friend enjoyed his chimichanga that trip, and I really loved the creamy-style rice that came with my dish (I don't think I've ever seen that before elsewhere?). Drinks are strong and tasty.  I've had some sort-of weird service here, though overall it's been totally fine. At least once a server has tried to upsell me on appetizers or desserts by asking straight out \"so are you going to order that [x]?\", x being whatever random item they choose off of the menu, which I find kind of odd? Another time, our server didn't say more than 2 words to us all night--but I'm from the northeast US, so honestly, that's sort of what I'm used to anyway!   This is the perfect place to bring out-of-town friends, a date, or family for a nice night out. It's a tad bit pricey for what you get, in my opinion, but the ambiance is nice and food is definitely delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere! Relaxed cross between restaurant and bar, trendy. The food was good but I wouldn't call it traditional Mexican, more American Mexican fusion. Missing some of the true Mexican flavored. Street tacos were good. The grilled Mahi was yummy.  Need more flavors in the beans and rice. And the salsa was more like tomato sauce with cumin. But overall a good place to eat."}
{"text":"We had dinner here a few nights ago with my sister and brother-in-law after the Coyotes/Blackhawks game. It was AMAZING! We all tried various tacos and the chicken enchilada. Everything was so fresh and delicious! The new decor really looks great too! I can't wait to go back this week!  You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, and all I have to say is AMAZING!!!! Our server (Kari?) was very sweet and attentive and the food was sooo good.   We ordered tacos and they are the best street tacos I've had in AZ. They are way bigger than the normal ones you may have had before and all of the ingredients are delicious. I had the pork, carne asada, and shrimp. Yum!!  Also, happy hour goes until 7pm! We went for a hike and didn't yelp for HH places and thought for sure no where still had happy hour but they did. My fiancé heard about this place from his boss- we also go to delux (next door) all the time as well. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant (it helps that its right next door to where we live). The happy hour is fantastic and lasts until 7pm! My family's favorite dishes are the Mahi Mahi bowl with creamy rice, the carne asada burrito, and the kids chicken beto's burritos. The salsas are excellent, along with the atmosphere and service. Sometimes the music is a little strange but, meh, the cheap drinks at happy hour make up for it :)"}
{"text":"Tried the three taco plate with shrimp, brisket and pork.  All were delicious, but I will be insisting my friends try the brisket."}
{"text":"Great spot in a trendy neighbor, loved the creamed rice and street tacos. Felicia , our server was very knowledgeable and provided attentive service. In Phoenix with many choices for Mexican, Mexx 32 deserves a try."}
{"text":"Went to Mexx32 this weekend with my friend who loved Revo Burrito! I haven't been here since it has been renovated and what a great new feel! I love how chips and salsa is FREE and their salsas are very fresh! Our server's name was Patrick and he was GREAT!! If you go there, make sure you sit in his section! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing taco spot! Tried a few that were all great, but a definite favorite were the Shrimp Tinga! It is shrimp, bacon and chorizo. Yummy! The different tastes are pretty incredible.   Also, tried the smoked brisket, carne asada, beer battered cod and mahi mahi. All wonderful. I also tried the signature margarita. Good stuff.   The service and ambience is cool, clean and inviting too! I was taken great care of by Sean and Lenny! Thank you!   I'll be back!! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas, great food and Kari was a top notch server. We visited happy hour and had quesadillas, and tacos. I recommend the tomatillo salsa with the quacamole."}
{"text":"This is a very hip place with a great patio, atmosphere and great mexican food. I always go for the fish tacos or the smoked beef ones when I am feeling skinny. The chips and salsa tray is great as well with 3 flavors. Love this place."}
{"text":"Really great, elevated Mexican food. The service was prompt and the food quality was great. We came for lunch but this would be a great happy hour spot too. We plan to come back to try \"Phoenix's Best Margarita\" for sure."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second time trying Mexx 32 since its remodel and transition from Revo.  It was outstanding.  I am so happy that they are up and running again and their remodel looks awesome.  The center bar concept that they have introduced is really unique.  First the service, top notch.  Tonight I was served by James who had an excellent personality, likes to make his customers laugh, is full of energy and had great interaction.  All too often wait staff disappears in the back to use their cell phones, not here.  Their staff and management is engaging their customers and making sure they are pleased.  It is obvious that they have handpicked the best of the best to serve here.    I had the Chicken Fajita Bowl this evening which was HOT, fresh and full of flavor.  Try it with the creamy rice and ask them for some Tomatio (hope I spelled that right) salsa to go on top.  They made some minor changes (or should I say upgrades) to the bowl since its Revo version, like cheese on top, but I have to say that it is very good.   They are constantly tweaking the menu and I will say that tonight's bowl was even better than the one I had last week when they had just re-opened.  Overall, the whole team here is making a constant effort to exceed customer expectations.  During my visit tonight I had the opportunity to chat with Austin, Todd and Lenny and their devotion to listening to their customers suggestions and implementing them is appreciated and unprecedented for restaurants in this area.  It is obvious that their commitment to the location is strong and I wish them the best and can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Used to be one of my favorite Mexican food joints in the area, but some how the menu devolved and quality went down. It's now closed."}
{"text":"Cool, trendy, fun in the Camelback Corridor.  Good food.  Go on Tuesday's for $2 Tecate beers."}
{"text":"Great find for a group of out of town folks. Met the owner who gave some great recommendations. Brisket, Mahi Mahi,and carnitas.  Quite yummy.  Beans got good review  Try it."}
{"text":"Great experience. Superb service. Had 6 different tacos and each one was really good. The creamy rice was the best. Try the guac with pomegranate seeds. Very refreshing."}
{"text":"Went here late on a Monday night because it was one of the few places still open for dinner. I was very pleasantly surprised! The food was excellent and our drinks were tasty. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great location, delicious food and fabulous service. I had lunch there today with a friend. We tried five of the different tacos - pork, 3 different seafood, and mushroom - and we loved them all. The chips and salsa were good. The frosted chocolate cake was delicious - even more so with the ice cream. The great service was what pushed my rating up to the fifth star. Everyone was friendly and helpful and cheerful (let's hope working with the general public doesn't try that attitude!). We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Taquitos were awesome but went for some tequila. Bartender Michelle was great... Friendly and great service... Food selection and atmosphere are great too."}
{"text":"A solid 4.5 stars and now one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the U.S. noting that I am devoid of quality in South Florida. Fantastic tacos (had the brisket and chicken) in insanely delicious soft corn shells that I have never had before, two great multi-cheese enchiladas and a great creamy white rice with black beans. Margueritas also were great although small. Restaurant is really  nice and at a great location. Highly recommend this place and certainly wanted to try many other items."}
{"text":"2 stars for taco Tuesday since there's only ONE taco option available: the taco dorado for $3.00. Then the regular price for the tacos are way too high; 5 bucks for a street taco seems steep. I ordered the veggie taco and chipotle mushroom taco. Both were mediocre in flavor and I kept scooping salsa from the stuff they give you with the tortilla chips to add in some taste. My friend said the breakfast burrito was good though, so perhaps I will return to try that. Otherwise, the service was great, and indoor décor is modern and chic."}
{"text":"Outstanding service!! Great food and drinks.!!  You have to try the Taco Tuesday and Happy Hour specials. ;-). Once it cools down, the patio will be amazing to hang out on. Overall great experience!!"}
{"text":"This place has awful communication and service. I have ordered from them twice now through doordash.com and once in the actual restaurant. Both of the times I ordered from doordash.com, I received something completely different than what I ordered. The first time, the manager I spoke with was very apologetic and immediately refunded my credit card. The second time it happened, today, the manager on staff was rude, unaware of their partnership with doordash and completely unwilling to refund my money or help me in anyway, completely unprofessional.  The one time I went to the actual restaurant to order take out I waited for 40 minutes. Each time I inquired about my order I was told it would only be 5-10 minutes. The person at the take-out counter was completely overwhelmed and clearly didn't know what was happening with the orders. I was told that someone made a huge order so mine got \"bumped\".   The only reason I didn't give a single star is because the food was actually tasty, which was why I gave it so many attempts. I will not order from this place again."}
{"text":"Had the takeout brisket burrito... Epic! So good and massive... Great price too...  Will have to try to dine in next time."}
{"text":"Great food! Great atmosphere!  Great service! Will be back often! Our office is down the street so we will love to visit oftrn. Every dish  we ordered was above expectations. Our server Kathy was kind, efficient,  and helpful. New favorite place!"}
{"text":"We frequent Mexx32 and what's not to love?   Food: The veggie burrito, tortilla soup and green chile cheese crisp are our go-tos but honestly, we've tried most of the things on the menu and there isn't anything I wouldn't recommend. I love their different salsas (make sure to ask for the hot if you like spicy salsa!)   Drinks: Their margaritas are smooth (but still not watered down and feel like you just got ripped off)-- great happy hour prices ($4 frozen and $5 on the rocks margs).   Service: The only time we ever had a problem with our food (a deliver order from Uber Eats), they immediately made it right - comped my entire next meal when I came in to eat, even though it was a small mistake... So 5-star service from both management, as well as bartenders and wait staff."}
{"text":"Welcome back creamy white rice and chicken fajita burrito. Mexx32 is a swank version of Revo Burrito with old and new items on the menu. Come check it out!"}
{"text":"I'm finally throwing in the towel on this place after 7 consistently mediocre experiences. Sometimes it's the slow, inattentive service. Other times it's the food quality, whether poorly made, taste terrible or just plain cold. Often it's a combination of the 3. I will always have fond memories of Revo, the former name and place that has become Mexx 32. I will never have fond Memories for Mexx 32. Too many other places within walking distance to ever get burned by this place again."}
{"text":"Had a good experience during my debut at this place. I still had thought it was called Revo, but it has a new name and new look, but the same owners and some of the same food. My favorite creamy white rice is still there and I had a pretty good fajita bowl with that rice and chicken and peppers to go. It could perhaps use  a bit more seasoning, but still a solid choice. The highlight of the hour long visit was getting a fancy drink for free that was being photographed for a magazine shoot. Also, the owner Lenny is a nice guy and he let me try two beef tacos for free. Those were served on semi-crispy shells and were good quality, but now they mostly have fancier tacos on corn tortillas and slightly higher prices. Change can be good and this place has the potential for another long run."}
{"text":"Love the food and bar service at this place.  I had the Tamale platter and the creamy white corn rice delicious.  Frozen strawberry margaritas are great also.  Have been back a few times and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Excellent everything.  Tacos are unique and tasty.  Service is as good.  Very warm folks."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance, especially the patio where there are no T.V.s!! :-)  Food was fresh and yummy!! All of the staff was friendly, caring and inviting.  I also appreciate being able to wash my hands without waiting for the bathroom! lol A definite go-to!! Try it! You'll like it! AND... they are open late for food! 2am!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken fajita rice bowl with creamy white rice. The food was EXCELLENT! Chips have a bit of a lime zest to them and very fresh taste! The chef even came out to ask us how our food was!! The place is very modern inside staff is very friendly and although they were busy we got our food rather quickly! Looks like a great place to come for happy hour! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Of all the problems I faced in Phoenix while on a business trip last week (heat, more heat,  the surface of the sun isn't this hot, trying not to throttle the next person who told me, \"but it's a dry heat\"), the one thing I cannot complain about is the quality of the food, nor of the service provided by the waitstaff.    My housemate and I went there late last week, entirely because we simply needed to go someplace that was dog-friendly.  The management and staff did everything possible to make certain that both of us + doggy had everything needed to make our meal and visit absolutely exquisite.  The agreed to split an absolutely heavenly tortilla soup between the two of us--which easily could have been a meal if it hadn't been split.  The margaritas were superb.  We each had tacos that were so good, we wish we could have them delivered to Colorado.  I ordered the Signature 32nd Street Tacos, mixing 3 for $14:  Carne Asada, Smoked Brisket, and Chicken Fajita.  The carne asada was solidly good, though not as great as I had when I lived in New Mexico.  The smoked brisket and the chicken fajita tacos were worthy of a standing ovation.   My housemate ordered the Taco Dorado, which he also thought was superb.  In addition to the fabulous food and margaritas, we felt the staff went above and beyond what was needed for good service, even checking on the dog (and taking a few selfies with the dog, too). I wish you guys were local to us.  Still,if I ever again find myself in Phoenix, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was bland.  Drinks where good.  Glass wall in between men and women's bathroom.  I could see the figure of a dude sitting on the crapper  while I tried to pee looking at this glass wall.  What a horrible design.   Put a real wall up !"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! !!! I love this place.  My first time here on taco Tuesday and free appetizers at the bar.  Frozen Margarita only 4.00 happy hour price.  Place is very clean and upscale.  I really like the service here.  They treated me well and checked up on me. ...this is a great place to enjoy happy hour with friends. Highly recommended! !!!"}
{"text":"We came here to grab a quick lunch and to check out the new spot in town! The atmosphere was open and inviting, I loved the lighting! The bar in the middle of the restaurant was equipped with TVs, perfect for football season coming up!   The food was delicious, we were very impressed! Their trio of homemade salsas and chips are fabulous {We even asked for a big bowl of their mild salsa because it was SO good!} Then we ordered the guacamole that was topped with pomegranate seeds. Yum! For my meal, I ordered the carne asada burrito that was simple but perfect. A yummy flour tortilla packed with loads of steak, pico & guac. I also ordered a side of the 'creamy' rice & beans. I was going to go healthy and order brown rice but was convinced that the creamy rice was worth it, and they were right! I left with the second half of my burrito + rice & beans for leftovers! ...Huge portions! The only thing that I wished was on the appetizer list was a queso dip of some sort {shhh, it's my guilty pleasure}.   The menu also has a variety of different tacos, bowls, tamales & enchiladas. We'll definitely be back to try some of those!"}
{"text":"Had a pleasant experience at Mexx 32!  My girlfriend and myself came here the night after the grand opening. First, they have a great ambiance. Props to the person who was in charge of decor and design of this restaurant.  I went with the three tacos. Very delicious! I decided not to have any alcohol tonight but they had plenty of options.   I would recommend to encourage the serving staff to have a little more energy! This place is brand new... Make menu recommendations.. Ask how we heard about you... Talk about specials.. This was the only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"Late Night spot. Get the Breakfast Burrito off the Late Night Happy Hour menu. Be amazed. Neiman Ranch Bacon and sausage in that bad boy."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  I really loved the Mahi Mahi bowl, it was delicious.  The bed of rice was creamy and a little tangy, so good.  My husband had a few different tacos, I had a bite of the carne asada one.  It was very good.  We also had dessert to go, we had the chocolate cake and the orange cheesecake flan.  Both were delicious, I am torn, but I think I liked the orange cheesecake flan better.  Can't wait to come back for some more."}
{"text":"Best spot to get some yummy tacos, a delicious margarita, and relax after a hard day at work. I love the vibe inside and the staff is very friendly. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Very yummy and very expensive! Being a big fan of Delux Burger, we decided to try their sister business next door - formerly known as Revo Burro and now goes by Mexx32.  The interior is classy and elegant, making Mexx32 a rather upscale Mexican restaurant. Don't expect Filiberto's here!  First off, service was tremendous. Our waiter was very attentive and on point with recommendations and enthusiasm for our lunch. We mentioned we were in a time crunch and he made sure everything happened as fast as possible, but without feeling rushed. During our meal, the owner stopped by to chat and make sure everything was ok. Again - excellent service at Mexx32. Now the food - thankfully the quality and flavours matched the service. The complimentary chips and salsa were great as starters. We ordered the cheese crisp, which was filled with flavourful and gooey varieties of cheese. It was a little on the soggy side, as opposed to crisp, but with that much cheese it's to be expected. For $12 though, that is the most expensive cheese crisp I have ever had!  For our entree we had the smoked brisket burrito. The meat was very good - you could taste that it was smoked for a long time but it was still quite tender. Wrapped in a flour tortilla, I didn't even notice what else was in the burro because I just focused on the flavour of the meat. A good burrito made great by very tasty brisket - however for $10 it was pretty small and thus ultimately is one of the pricier burritos I have ever had. notice a trend here? everything tastes good, but is crazy expensive. Now Mexx32's secret weapon - the creamy rice. wow that was fantastic! Easily one of the tastiest sides of rice I have ever had. but guess what? crazy expensive! ok it's only 3 dollars, but it comes in literally the smallest side dish you can imagine - about 2-3 forkfuls.  I am a working class joe, so this is the type of place I can visit maybe 1-2 times a year, but I would definitely be interested in eventually trying it again and exploring more of the menu (and ordering 4 servings of that rice! lol), but $40 for 1 burrito, 1 cheese crisp, 1 side of rice and 1 soda is much too pricey for me to be a regular.  High quality food with terrific flavours, small portions, and big prices. Mexx32 is a special-occasion Mexican restaurant that will not disappoint, but not a place to frequent regularly, unless you are a Biltmore millionaire.  Could easily be a 5 star rating, but the pricing makes it 3 stars, while the food taste bumps it to 4 stars. Recommended if you can afford it - 2 person meal will average $60."}
{"text":"I recommend the Mexx 32 Margarita and carne asada bowl.  So yummy.  The staff is awesome.  The art in the restaurant and bathrooms are great!  It's a must see/visit."}
{"text":"I met some girlfriends here for lunch today and had a great experience!  I had been in Revo Burrito before and really like how they expanded the space, modernized it and truly made it relaxing and comfortable.  The service was attentive and helpful, the atmosphere was great and the food was really good and reasonably priced for the amount of food you receive.  I enjoyed the chicken fajita rice bowl with brown rice...super tasty and a big portion."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been going to Mexx32 for about last 9 months. I do enjoy their tacos!! I love the complimentary chips and salsa(s). My all time favorite thing about Mexx32 is the margaritas! I love margaritas and I especially love when they are made correctly!! They have traditional and new creations. So try them out! Monday is \" Margarita Monday\" $3 traditional margaritas all night and some other beer specials! Great decor and in the spring it's so nice to sit on the patio and just relax with good drinks and conversation! As long as we live in the area we'll keep coming! The staff is attentive and always polite!"}
{"text":"Found my new favorite taco and cocktail spot. I enjoy this MUCH better than Taco Guild, folks. Great service shown by friendly eager to please servers that appear to WANT to be there. I also appreciate the owner was there one afternoon and making rounds to make sure we were taken care of and our business was appreciated. Great tacos and good drinks! Great contemporary ambiance and music, without overdoing it and feeling cold and industrial like some places. Modern atmosphere is great, but don't take the warmth out of the Southwest! They do it right here. My belly is always satisfied and I always feel comfortable and happy on my little corner of their patio. Pet friendly as well."}
{"text":"Love eating at this restaurant. Very trendy and clean with awesome decor. I always get their 3 tacos for $14 deal with combination any of these: Smoked Brisket, Carne Asada, Chipotle Mushroom, or Shrimp Tinga. I have not tried any other items on their menu, but my friends seem to enjoy their food as well."}
{"text":"Ro and I were in the mood for a little snack before heading to the movies in Scottsdale so I decided on Mexx32. Since he's never been here before, I thought it would be the ideal treat for Happy Hour. As many times I've been to this place, I've never tried their HH. Weather was perfect for outdoor patio seating!  I love their Happy Hour menu.  We had the quesadillas, guacamole and two flour tacos. Chavez was our served and he was incredible. Food and service great as always. Ro loved Mexx32 and I'm certain we'll return more often. Cheers***"}
{"text":"My friend and I went today. I had the smoked pork burrito, he had the chicken fajita one. Delicious.   We were also the first to try the Red Velvet Flan. O-M-G it was STUPID!!!(that means it was so good, you should slap whomever is sitting closest to you) #lawddd  Oh and Chico was our server and he was outstanding.  Reasons you should go:  - Beautiful decor (it's sexy) - Amazing food (it's stupid) - Reasonable prices (make it rain for the tip) - Excellent service (Chico was a B.O.S.S.) - Happy hour from 3pm - 6pm, and 10pm - close (dranks) - Red Velvet Flan (slap yo mama right now)  Get there now!"}
{"text":"This is the second time my partner and I have dined here and I really want to like this place. The service is meh as is the food. This trip we ordered the green chili quesadilla and there was way too much cheese on it and I am always leery of a Mexican food restaurant that uses yellow cheese. Ooh well, I got over the bland quesadilla and ordered a shredded beef darado taco and there was no spice to it! My partner ordered the tinga shrimp taco and it was also a fail. The chips were stale and blah. I do like the salsa but the guacamole is horrible, who puts pomegranate seeds in guac!?! I get they are trying to me new age but they need to get the basics right first."}
{"text":"Keeping this short and sweet.  This is a restaurant/bar that wants its patrons happy and completely satisfied.  Excellent, personal service, great tasting and creative food, yummy cocktails, beautiful funky atmosphere.  I was so impressed by this place, I cannot wait to return to Phoenix to eat here again."}
{"text":"Decent, stopped in for lunch, sort of fancy Mexican food, good chips and salsa, good environment, clean facilities, excellent service.  Four stars...I will go back."}
{"text":"Great service! The prices are a bit higher but delicious food. The salsas for the chips they bring were all good. We enjoyed our visit."}
{"text":"We went with a large group last night and the service was excellent. All of our orders were perfect and she split the checks without us asking. The happy hour drinks were great, I am a margarita lover and the $5 ones were really good! The brisket taco was by far my favorite food item although the carne asada quesadilla and brisket burrito were awesome. I would go back tonight and eat the same thing all over again!"}
{"text":"Great environment. Services was great and the food was very fresh and had great flavor! Had strawberry lemonade with a rice bowel flavor was great. Husband had taco trio with rice and be loved the flavor of the corn tortillas."}
{"text":"A group of us went here because we had a gift certificate...thinking it was a hipster place we kinda felt out of place.  We were surprised to find this intimate restaurant very down to earth.  The staff was attentive and fast and made great recommendations.  The interior is upscale and their skull logo is very cool.  The food is a little on the expensive side but worth it.  The Smoked Brisket Taco was incredible.  The Margaritas are large and strong and made the correct way."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the reason I Yelp.  Visiting Phoenix from out of town, I was dissatisfied with the options for \"good Mexican food\"  on the recommendations list from the 5 star resort I was visiting (mainly overpriced, high class and showy, but overall weak review joints) After scouring over the descriptions of 7 or 8 options, I finally found Mexx32.  Had I simply walked by the establishment, I probably would have ignored it due to my strip mall restaurant judgmental tendencies.  However I am so glad I trusted it's 4.5 star review instead!  The food is exactly what I craved. Delicious light corn chips with fresh guacamole, wholesome indigents filling flavorful tacos, and a perfect, classic, sipping margarita to wash it down with.  The entire menu is labeled with gluten free and vegan options (endless appreciation for that!) and the service was exceptional. The ambience is casual, but warm and inviting with soft lighting and comfortable tables.   While I was there I even got the meet the owner, who was going table to table ensuring guests were satisfied and being well served.  How often do strip mall restaurants feature that kind of attentiveness?!  If I lived in the area I would definitely be a repeat customer many times over. They even have a convenient  to go window, which would no doubt fuel my stomach and soul on a regular basis.   I can't comment on the \"authenticity\" of the food, however if you want a solid fish taco and great service, look no further."}
{"text":"I had the kale salad and it was wilted lettuce and kale nothing special tasting. And my wife had the shrimp tinga and again it was ok fair at the most in taste.  The atmosphere was a five star but the food sucked!"}
{"text":"Revo burrito was a favorite of mine so I was sad to see them go. Lucky for me- something WAY better has come along! Mexx32 has been open a week and I'm already two amazing visits in.   This great new spot in my neighborhood has such an awesome atmosphere. It makes for a cool little date spot, featuring some awesome local art. I easily recognized a few pieces by Lalo Cota hanging on the walls and am absolutely in love with the Mexx32 skull logo. Hopefully I'll see it printed on shirts for sale soon? The lighting, color palette, and even furnishings make this a perfect place for a date or drinks with friends.   The people here are excellent as well. Our first night we were served by a sweet girl, named Rochelle, who provided attentive service with a cheerful and friendly tone.  On both visits- the bussers kept our table clear of any dishes we were done with and we even had the opportunity to meet a gentlemen, named Todd, and the owner, Lenny- as they were sure to thank us for our business and see that our experiences were pleasureable ones.   I have to admit, one of my favorite things about this place is the fact that I located one of Arizona's best local chefs, Austin Carlise, who I met at a downtown foodie festival. He's got a reputation for producing some of the best street tacos I've ever had so naturally- that's what I indulged in my first night when I saw him. I had the Carne Asada taco (with juicy, flavorful meat), the Beer Battered Cod taco (fresh tasting with the perfect crunchiness), and the Shrimp Tinga taco (topped with Chorizo & pico de gallo), per his recommendation. Needless to say, I was impressed again. Better yet- our server told us his tacos have won awards in the past. Glad to know I've still got good taste!  For dessert, I had the Orange Cheesecake Flan and was so happy with how light and refreshing it tasted. Who knew you could have cheesecake and flan combined?! My favorite part about this dessert is that it's not something you find anywhere else. Awesome.  Our second night there, I tried the rice bowl with Carne Asada (which I can't get enough of) and absolutely have to recommend you try the creamy rice. It's a hearty dish to eat, so expect to be stuffed- but I promise you won't regret it a single bit. Again- the Carne Asada was perfect. I also tried the North of the Border drink from the bar menu and loved the fruit flavors that came through. As before- my waitress was awesome and helped me decide what to drink by breaking down my preferences and matching them to drinks on the menu.   I'm beyond excited these guys are open and running.  Revo, you will be missed.  Mexx32, welcome to the neighborhood. So glad to have you near!"}
{"text":"So just went there two days ago for my birthday, and what happened? The tacos were totally different. We were laughing at my shrimp taco it only had one piece of shrimp. Also I get the sex appeal bartenders are sexy that's how they get tips but the girl back there had practically all her boobs popping out. Like seriously it's 3pm not 11pm. I would not recommend this place as a \"family friendly establishment\" man I really liked you guys but looks like you've guys changed for the worse. Bummer!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Aside from the food and drinks being completely DELICIOUS, the layout and vibe to the entire restaurant is so fun!! I love the modern, relaxing, yet fun feel! Not to mention -- the outdoor seating was one of my favorite parts!"}
{"text":"Always great food Highly recommended  Try the carne asada bowl  Great chips and salsa too"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go midday for lunch or happy hour. You can't go wrong with the smoked pork or the carne asada every way the serve it. The signature margarita is totally worth it too. But Brittany real makes the place shine, best bartender in ALL of Phoenix! And she has an amazing magic trick you don't want to miss!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Award winning tacos but the pork taco seemed to be missing something."}
{"text":"Trendy Mexican restaurant in the Biltmore area that sports a great atmosphere for catching a ball game on tv in the bar or for meeting friends for a casual get-together. Everything I've sampled on the menu has been fresh and flavorful. The only ding I have to this place is the service. Either it's great or it's hopeless, and sometimes I just don't want to deal with the inconsistency in that regard. So lots of times, I'll just get takeout from here :-)"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing!  The pork taco was amazing along with the tamale!  The pork is roasted for over 12 hours --- Great service ambience and overall 5+ stars!  Guess they have another regular!  Seriously amazing!!"}
{"text":"The Mexican food here is really good. I use to love coming here for a quick bite when they were revo burrito. They have kept the same menu overall, with some tasty new additions. The atmosphere is laid back and chill but classier than what revo was. I love the changes to the menu and the location! It's a New favorite!!"}
{"text":"I got take out burritos here that were healthy and tasty. I also went here for happy hour. The margaritas are not very strong but the price was good.  The quesadillas were cheesy and good but not super healthy, the guacamole and salsa were decent, tortilla chips were hot. The cheese crisp was spicy and cheesey. Service was quick and friendly but I did go on a Tuesday afternoon and I think we were the only ones there."}
{"text":"A solid enough experience but I couldn't help comparing it to its predecessor, Revo Burrito.  They no longer have those great multicolored chips and the green salsa.  They still have the old revo burritos but are smaller and at the same price.  I understand the attraction of rebranding the place and positioning yourself so that you can offer the high end tequilas.  I don't mind this place I just wish they would have also kept Revo."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Atmosphere is wonderful, set outside since weather is amazing right now. My wife and I both order three tacos and swapped back and forth so we could all try different things. We will definitely be back and will recommend to others as well."}
{"text":"Great spot went in in a Saturday night loved the decor ... The fixtures the lighting everything was modern chic fun vibe. And the bartender Brittany was so knowledgable of the cuisine and the drinks she made me were fantastic. I Would recommend this spot to anyone . The tequila selection was amazing!!!!!!!  The carne asada tacos were bombdiggity!!!!!!!Bring the family!"}
{"text":"Love love love Mexx32! Food is great! Staff is great! Grady is our favorite bartender! My only complaint is the music... it way too quiet, spa like. #boring When I'm at a bar I want it to be lively and music is key! Please please change up the music!"}
{"text":"My significant other and I initially went to Central Bristo but decided to just order a couple drunks and go eat at Mex 32. Best decision EVER!! Not only do they the best chips and salsa (they were thick chips and came out hot) with three salsas but they also have this really good sweet cream corn rice (addicting). Our server, Chico, really was the cherry on top to make it a perfect restaurant experience. It was refreshing to have a server as passionate about the restaurant and their commitment to quality. If you go in ask for Chico... You will be impressed!"}
{"text":"So...I hadn't noticed that this place had changed from Revo burrito to MEXX 32, I knew it was under construction, but finally went here on Saturday night, I was going to go to Delux, but it was pretty packed so we walked over here, we just wanted a few cocktails.   So as we sat and enjoyed our complimentary chips and salsa over a beer and a strawberry daiquiri, and we admired how nicely this place was put together, very upscale, plenty of room and seating. And clean. good music, great atmosphere. A pleasant experience all around.   So it got even better when the owner Lenny dropped by our table to ask how everything was, I have met Lenny several times thru out the years when I worked for 944 magazine and Destination.tv and we reviewed and frequented Zen 32. We had a nice conversation with Lenny where he explained that things are going very well and he was extremely happy with the turn out so far, they have not even had the grand opening yet.  We had already eaten at Ra, earlier in the evening so we were not really hungry but Lenny said we should try the street taco's if we had the chance.  We tried them, we got the sampler plate and tried three different taco's and we really enjoyed them, I particularly enjoyed the Mushroom tacos, something a little different but very very good.   I live within walking distance of this place. So I can't wait to make this one of my new favorite haunts.  The bar is great and has a huge selection of tequilas.   Lenny has hit a home run with this concept, I think it is going to do very well and I will definitely be back with friends."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday night with my boyfriend and Brittany was our bartender she was so sweet. It was our first time and the food was great and drinks were delicious! She told us about taco Tuesday we will be back for that! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Picked Mexx32 over some other, more tried and true places on Yelp based on the \"modern\" atmosphere.  While it was good, I'd probably try a more authentic spot next time.  It was nice to eat outside...both the drink menu and the food menus were pretty robust - but our server told us we had to order the tacos...so we obeyed. Assortment of 3 - out of about 12 options...like brisket, fried cod, mahi, roast pork, carne asada, shrimp/chorizo & mushroom.  He spoke highly of the mushroom taco, so I got that, shrimp and carne asada.  They were open face, and loaded with tasty toppings...on a single soft shell. They needed to double up on the shell as they got soggy right away and fell apart. I'm not even sure they were corn...they could have been flour.   I added a side of rice and beans. They have 3 varieties of rice and 2 of beans. I opted for the \"amazing creamy white\" rice and black beans and was not disappointed.   Over all - atmosphere was very nice, the table was too small for all the stuff that goes onto a table at a Mexican restaurant. The servers were helpful - too helpful...he talked a LOT...and was a little too pushy at times.  The cocktail was great and the portions were good. I've had more authentic tacos in Harrisburg though...hope to get another shot at some Mexican food while I'm in AZ though ... since we are only a short drive from the boarder!"}
{"text":"I, like most people, was a very faithful Revo Burrito customer and so when Mexx32 opened its doors, I was excited but skeptical... I really liked Revo with the construction paper, star lights, and bright decor...  Must be the teacher in me...   When Mexx32 first opened I was really surprised by the expansion and the decor was really nice, very modern and hip... Everything from the light fixtures to the local art work on the walls is very well executed... I really like the bar and the wide variety of tequilas that are offered... The outdoor patio is also very elegant as well  The service: Service is very top notch here. James is one of the best servers that I have ever had. He is personable, knowledgable, and persuasive. I don't want myself to sound like a pushover but James has been very helpful in guiding me to the right dishes... While Mexx32 no longer has my favorite green chili burrito, I have really enjoyed all of the menu items that I have tried thus far... We will get to that in the food section... I have had the wonderful opportunity of meeting the owner, Lenny, and he is a total gem. I get intimidated sometimes when meeting such highly successful business owners because I am quite the foodie but Lenny was very, very charming and asked for my critiques here and there... Now I know why his businesses are so successful and I found it extremely cool that he spent the first few weeks actually working in his restaurant and checking up on people himself. The passion and love for food, owning a business, and pleasing people is something that Lenny has mastered and I am very grateful to have met him!  The food: The tacos are all very good, my favorites are the Smoked Pork, Carne Asada, and the Smoked Brisket... I believe someone told me that they got a smoker for those tacos specifically... Really good! The enchiladas combination is good too... Idk why but I don't care too much for their rice and beans (sorry)... The creamy rice just doesn't do it for me so I opt for the white rice usually...   The staff: the staff is all very wonderful- from Lenny to Austin to Matt to the lovely female bartenders that are handling take out orders... everyone is very eager to please, what more could you ask of a restaurant?"}
{"text":"The new Mexx32 is really nice, the food Amazing!  I had Mushroom Tacos and Cod Tacos, and a berries Mojito, very good. Our server Rochelle was very helpful and fast, thanks"}
{"text":"This is such a cool place.. Friendly staff! Amazing Margaritas. The street tacos are a must.. Especially the mahi mahi !!! Will be back when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Why mess with a good thing ?   Well this place used to be called REVO Burrito. I went maybe two times a month. I enjoyed it because it was low key, easy going, quite and can always get a table and relax.. My spot has now gone.. and we now have MEXX32. ( and I am not happy about it )   The good - The expansion was massive, its space is now a full scale eatery/restaurant.  The service is Fast ! It used to take me about 15 mins to get my food... both inside and to go . I didn't mind because the kitchen was a one or two man show with one or two girls up front.. Now theres about 10 people In the kitchen ( fri night - and 10 on the floor.. ( abit over kill IMO)  They have a large bar which houses many and many more liquors. The food menu is the same , and I enjoy the rice and the chips seem to have gotten better !   The bad... - & UGLY - The prices has raised on average 3 to 5 dollars. My burrito WITH rice and beans used to be under 8 or 9 dollars. NOW the burrito its self is 8 dollars and the rice and beans is an extra 3... ? ( Infact the combo for both burritos and tacos  used to be $9.95 ) No more taco meal either... They are 5 dollars a piece ( used to be a meal under 9 )  Im sorry if I say this out loud... BUT WTF ! Its the same exact food... BUT more money ? Is the extra 3 dollars for the extra staff and space... CAUSE.. I didn't ask for all that ! ? !   Also its extremely loud. After a long work day, that's not what I am looking for. A burrito is a burrito. Its not high end culinary Mexican.. Its basic stuff. AND they no longer have the 2 dollar Amy Coe cookie.. NOW they have 7 dollar deserts.    There is more staff.. Which is great, as food is faster..BUT gone are the relaxed days of eating in peace and a non \"nose in the air/see and be seen \"spot.  Hello to the pregame /dinner spot. :(  I no longer feel comfortable relaxing in sweats, or hanging after shopping, or a pick up and go vibe. You now have to come alllll the way in.. See and be seen, go to the bar and sit.. To order food to go.   Im sorry , but thats why i liked this spot, for the easy going vibe. Chipotle didn't change and I can still get the same food and easy vibe and basic margarita without the fluff, So I guess I will have to save MEXX32 for occasions . :(   revoburrito.com/2gomenu.pdf   the old menu"}
{"text":"Looking for a late night bite and was directed here by the bartender at Churchills Cigar Bar. Walked in to a real hip trendy place that we kinda just figured wasn't going to cut it because we're to old, ha.  But we were happily WRONG! The bartender Katherine was all you would want and more. She was welcoming, high energy and informative. As always we were looking for the secret menu item that would make us happy and she delivered. Shrimp Tinga with creamy rice, it doesn't sound too special but WOW, it was. Tons of perfectly sauteed shrimp rolled around with bacon and chorizo and seasoned to perfection. The rice was the perfect foil for the giant flavors of the Tinga, so rich and creamy and not mushy.   Good food, attentive service, good pricing, not much else we look for. Oh and we watched a gentleman in a red coat cleaning like crazy, actually everyone was quietly cleaning even the manager. But (we later learned was Chef Gaston) was cleaning the place like a you would hope a hospital would be and it was all after midnight. Nice job Mixx, well done!"}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Phoenix, I always take my family from Indiana here as well as out of state clients. Sad to see it close for some reason"}
{"text":"First time checking the place out since the remodel and name change. It's still the same food (although the chips are different -- but still good). I usually go for the carne asada burrito which is great but today I tried the mahi mahi rice bowl which was great! It came with tortillas on the side but the bowl itself was plenty of food. My colleague went for her usual bean, cheese, and rice burrito (she's a veg) and said it was just as good as it had been. She also enjoyed their strawberry lemonade. The atmosphere is much better than the old space and there's much more room for dining in. It used to be all counter service -- the takeout counter is still there but it's now evolved into full service dining. Bar in the middle of the restaurant and I thought the lighting fixtures were cool! I want to go back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Great taco tuesday. We really enjoyed the fried tacos for $3 with a couple tecates. Hip little spot ..open til 2am  I would recommend  the beef.. it was delish"}
{"text":"I just ordered their chicken quesadilla off Uber eats. I was starving after work and had no food in my fridge. They gave me a side of guacamole, chips, sour cream and salsa."}
{"text":"GOOD QUALITY, HEALTHY MEXICAN FOOD!  Well, the experience here was mostly good. All the food was very tasty.  I was not very impressed with the brisket taco. It was VERY dry. I am very spoiled when it comes to brisket.  Little miss BBQ is the best bbq in AZ and has the most incredible brisket you will ever taste!  Now the service. It was good, and our server Patrick was a very nice guy who was attentive and definitely cares about customer service. My only suggestion to him is to tone down his energy, be more relaxed, and talk much slower.  There was this older lady(some kind of supervisor/manager) that was going around yelling at some of the servers/ other managers.  She stood right in front of our table, about 2 feet from us, and was scolding a staff member.  Your the one who should be scolded lady.  Customer service 101- don't argue or scold your staff right in front of customers.  I don't think LENNY would be happy with you!"}
{"text":"Overrated. I work across the street and my coworkers and I used to love coming here for lunch. Service and food quality has consistently declined. The best thing on the menu? The free chips and salsa.  They have tried to make this place a sports bar and added glass around the  bar. Now it feels very small and blocked off and it's a maze to get to the bathroom. Also is it really necessary to have a VIP section?"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, trendy, good food. But the best part....during happy hour their traditional margarita is only $5, but it tastes like a $10 margarita."}
{"text":"Mexx32 reminds me of Joyride - but different decor and less crowded. We sat on the patio and our server gave us recommendations - she loves the Mahi Mahi bowl. So I got that with cream rice. The bowl was a generous amount of rice and Mahi Mahi that I barely finished it and took the rest of it home. The taste was delicious! I can tell the food isn't good for you in terms of calories but who cares?! It's so good you have to try it!!!  Overall, I'll be back to try other items on the menu. I did think the prices are similar to places like Joyride. Sorry- didn't take any pictures because I was too hungry to bust out my phone and take a pic."}
{"text":"Found this place based on their Yelp reviews. Came here for a date with the hubs and really enjoyed the ambiance, service and food. The classic margarita was strong and served in an actual margarita glass, not some hipster mason jar BS. Delicious tacos and vegan options! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Neat atmosphere. Upscale Mexican. Food was excellent. Our server was friendly and very helpful. Try the creamy Spanish rice. Delish!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I just paid $17 for a very uneventful two enchiladas with same ol same ol rice and beans."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar...excellent service and great food. We love this restaurant for its ambiance and their tacos. Sean the bartender is outstanding.  Across from us was the weather anchor for channel 3, so this is the place for the locals..."}
{"text":"Rare fun and trendy taco place in Biltmore area. The margaritas are fresh and delicious. My new favorite spot for late night food!"}
{"text":"First visit impressions: Hip atmosphere, excellent wait staff, owner works the room and makes patrons feel welcome, food very good, margaritas very good. In general, very good experience and definitely worth returning again."}
{"text":"Great street tacos! Tried three: brisket, carne asada, and chicken fajita. All of them great! Had the house margarita and strawberry. Both very good and only $5! We sat at the bar. Great customer service! The manager came and introduced himself. Very friendly staff. Beautiful atmosphere with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Awesome margaritas!! There tacos are amazing! Great service!! They are very friendly and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is awesome and vibrant!"}
{"text":"The service was unusually strained tonight. Not the norm and no Jake. New person is trying to catch up but yikes."}
{"text":"Awesome place with amazing street tacos. Come in a Tuesdays for taco Tuesday or for their happy hours. You'll find some really awesome happy each time!"}
{"text":"Mexx32 is such a fun neighborhood addition!  The bar and table seating is open, not cramped, and the whole vibe of the place is laid back and cool.    We went for Taco Tuesday (who can beat $4 for a taco and a Tecate), and was pleasantly surprised with the food quality and service.  Our waitress was incredibly friendly, and the owner, Lenny, made sure to introduce himself and gave us some advice on what to try for the next time we visit.  One thing that stood out for us, was that the taco Tuesday special is usually a fried taco (chicken or beef), but we asked if we could have our not fried, and they were happy to accommodate. So glad they could do that for us!  Not only was the taco tasty, but the other items we had from the happy hour menu (Mon-Fri until 7pm) were also delicious!  My favorite has to be the breakfast burrito.  Trust me on this one......it's large, in charge, and worth it ;)  Looking forward to going back to enjoy more tasty Mexican treats!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant! Their happy hour and reverse happy hour deals are awesome. The food is absolutely amazing and it's a very cool environment to hang out in. The service is always very friendly, however, they're not always quick. It's definitely worth the wait though. The chicken fajita rice bowl is definitely worth a try, it's my new favorite dish."}
{"text":"Best brisket tacos and guacamole. Would highly recommend. Plus we were met at the door by the kindest and happiest young man, Jose. Great experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch with my teenage daughter today..  She had two tacos (carne asada and mahi-mahi), she said the pico de gallo was very good as well as the sauce on the mahi-mahi. She also remembers Revo burrito's creamy white rice, so was very excited to order a bowl of that. The black beans were also good, but I miss the little bit of lime everybody used to put in them.  She also had a glass of the peach lemonade and said it was wonderful, sweet and tangy.    I ordered the mahi mahi rice bowl and it was absolutely fantastic and I had the creamy base as well, absolutely recommend. I also had a glass of Pinot Grigio.   Very nice ambiance, great service from Kathy.  Total bill $42 before tip"}
{"text":"Good food, decent prices and nice decor. For us, it's great. It's within walking distance and the kids love it. Come for Taco Tuesday and get some good deals on, imagine this, their tacos! Lots of good choices and portions are large, so expect some leftovers unless you eat like Adam Richman."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. It took me a while to try it, but I found myself here a few weeks ago, and was really not impressed, rather found myself really disappointed.   My friend and I were here during Happy Hour, and ordered chicken taquitos to share. I ordered pulled-pork tacos as an entree, and she got an enchilada that was smothered (overly) in sauce. The pork that I had was dry, and the rice was dry too. The refried beans were okay, but it wasn't worth the price we paid.   The saving grace here was our waitress. She was super nice and helpful, but neither of us enjoyed the food. It was very mushy, not tasty, and honestly I'm not sure why they are rated as high as they claim to be. There is much better Mexican food to find in the valley, this place just isn't one of them."}
{"text":"We are in town for a tournament and needed a quick bite before the game. This was nearby and the prices were very reasonable and the food was awesome. My son is a picky eater as well and the waitress was very happy to run to their burger place next door to pick up an order for us. If you are ever in Phoenix this is a place to go and you can enjoy the sports game as well. Great vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Finally writing a review after my third visit!  Twice for lunch and once for dinner. AWSOME food and love the patio. Rachele was our waitress and she honestly was probably the BEST server we have had!  Great personality and amazing service. Food is so fresh and drinks are great too. Can't wait to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stepped in for National Margarita day a few weeks ago and I'm hooked. The staff is friendly and attentive, ambiance is cool and contemporary and slightly edgy. The margaritas are fresh and delicious and the tacos are pretty authentic. Best of all its open late night so when I get those late night cravings this will be where I go!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Mexx32! I used to come when it was Revo Burrito. Its been my favorite for years. When they changed their name and remodeled location i was afraid too much would change but it was a great upgrade. Their service is great too. My favorite is the chicken fajita bowl. It is so delicious. Their traditional margaritas are the best. Everyone must try!!!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location (next to shopping center) deter you. This place has a great atmosphere from the music to the bar. Very chill and the skeleton sitting at the end of the bar adds an edge.   The chips and salsa were top notch - chips thin and crisp; lightly salted. Guacamole with pomegranates on top and it works well! Next the tacos. Mahi and smoked brisket was top notch the smoke on the brisket requires you to keep eating until it's gone! The seasoning on the mahi was perfect.    Would definitely stop by again when in Phoenix close to biltmore hotel."}
{"text":"I wish a there were 1/2 steps to the review stars.  We order take out from this restaurant about once a week.  I have only a 50/50 shot of getting what I ordered.  Today a sub black beans in lieu of rice came with neither, so I walked back across the street to fix it and was met by the take out person telling me \"that's not what the ticket said\". I'm sorry that the guy answering the phone didn't enter what we repeated back and forth three times, but I'm not sure how that is my fault.  I order, he repeats back, I repeat as confirmation.  It's usually a good method!  When did an apology for screwing up my order get left off the Customer Service check list?  Once I dumped the black beans into my mahi bowl it was edible, but too salty.  (That's saying a lot, usually I crave salt after a jaunt into the AZ heat.)"}
{"text":"Used to frequent Revo burrito and I'm happy to say mexx 32 is definitely an upgrade. The atmosphere is trendy, yet relaxing. The staff is friendly, and knowledgeable. Came here with a few friends at 11:30pm on a Thursday and was happy to find they serve their normal menu until 12, and have a late night menu until 2am! It's so hard to find late night spots that serve food in this area of the city, and don't rush you out the door.   My favorite cocktail so far is the Paloma altos. Fantastic refreshing grapefruit cocktail for the hot days ahead. And who could could forget the creamy rice! Which is just as good as I remember it! The healthy options are always a nice touch too. Although I recommend the chicken fajita creamy rice bowl or revo breakfast burrito red enchilada style. The owner even stopped by to ask how our evening had gone and to recommend the tacos. Looking forward to giving them a try on our next visit :)"}
{"text":"Excellent!   Not the best I've ever had, but absolutely worth the trip.   The asada had a nice burnt crisp to it, which tasted great."}
{"text":"Sensational food and a great atmosphere. The skinny margarita was delicious and I highly recommend the green chili cheese crisp."}
{"text":"Second time here already in a week! We absolutely love this place! The food is phenomenal and the drinks are fantastic. We love Lenny Rosenbergs restaurants and this does not disappoint! We loved Revo but this is great upgrade. It's a must try and one of our new favorite places. I highly recommend the smoked brisket taco and the smoked pork!"}
{"text":"The food is always good, today they were off their game. The table service was fine but the good took 39 minutes to appear, it was pretty slow in the place so that didn't seem to be the reason why. When the food did come up the orders were mixed up and we had to play food swap. I would visit again as this is not par for the place."}
{"text":"The best margaritas ! Michelle at the bar is the sweetest! One of the few places in Phoenix where the kitchen is open until 2 AM. Perfect place for those boring Sunday nights :)"}
{"text":"Love Love Love!  Location & Food amazing! A bit warm inside as it's that time of year to crank up the a/c. But the staff & the quality of food worth being a bit warm!!"}
{"text":"Tough to obtain a \"trendy go to spot\" when in a strip mall but they nailed it. Such a cool vibe and outstanding menu to match. The corn tortilla, smoked brisket tacos were very impressive! Excellent service too...can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food. Margarita was good but it was 9.00 and mostly ice! Less ice more liquid please!!! Come on!"}
{"text":"Great chips.  Good salsa.  Everything else (tacos, rice, etc.) was average and a little boring.  Not sure how this place has a 4.5 star rating."}
{"text":"Brisket taco was excellent! Pregnant so didn't get to have the margaritas although I loved the peach lemonade. Great service and very cute environment- will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Seems a bit too hipity hip for my normal taste but It grows on you as you bite into some delicious tacos. Place has great, fast service and I love the trio salsa platter for the warm tortilla chips they serve. I like the individual speakers they have out on the bar to control television volume. Mine didn't seem to be hooked up to either TV but I wasn't particularly in the mood to watch anything so I didn't care. Its a nice little hidden gem for the locals but I enjoyed blending in with this crowd."}
{"text":"I had a rep for work bring us Mexx32 for lunch today. I had 3 chicken tacos and the chips. First, I didn't realize that the corn tortillas would be 3 tortillas for one taco. I get it, to keep it from falling apart, but when I'm trying to watch my figure it makes me a little nervous. Even though I had chips... Lol. The tacos and the chips were fantastic though. Absolutely delicious. Pico was a bit spicy, but everything was so good! Would absolutely come back :)"}
{"text":"Very good service.  Maybe the best biscuit taco I have ever had. Creamy rice was unique and very good as well."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Easy to get in and out if you're looking for something late at night. Some healthy options too. The owner is often present and seems interested in his customer's experience and opinion of his menu.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been weary of some Mexican places in the Phoenix area.      This place has definitely bucked that norm for me.  I was looking for a place that I could sit at a bar and enjoy a good tamale with a nice Mexican lager.  So I chose this place based off the yelp photos.  I started out with the chips and guac, which was pretty good.  For dinner I ordered the tamales combination plate - one chicken and one pork.  they were both excellent.  Well prepared and nicely seasoned.    The service was quick and very friendly and the atmosphere was nice.  Overall I thought this place was pretty good."}
{"text":"Love the food and prices here.  Delicious tacos and burritos.  The \"night club\" atmosphere is not really my style, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Excellent start to finish from food to service. I called the day before to see if their sauces, rice and beans are vegetarian. Asked the host the quick question and manager took the call to enthusiastically tell me about their food and concept to have something for everyone. Very accommodating with a request for dinner items at lunch. Incredible and well-developed flavors, but not greasy. Some of the best tamales I've ever had. My father, who's lived in Phoenix for 20 years, had a beef dish and said it was one of the best Mexican meals he's ever had."}
{"text":"I went in after work to get a burrito to go. I've haven't been before and ordered the smoked brisket burrito. When I got home and opened the bag, I found that my 9.75 purchased me this tiny 6 inch burrito. And I feel like I'm being generous by saying it was six inches. The menu claimed that there was gonna be cheese and sauce in the burrito. That must have been a typo.  It was filed with only dry brisket. Needless to say I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Ate here last week.  We drove 27 miles to meet friends here.  The reviews were right on!  Food was among the best Mexican I have ever had!  Service was great.  Margaritas were the best!  Thinking of going again while we visit the area!  One word-Wonderful!"}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere is eccentric and very modern, gives off a good vibe and the server is very quick about getting food to you. The happy hour deal is the best one I have come across yet. The food is amazing especially the shrimp Tinga taco as well as the mex 32 ensalada."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday and it was delicious with such a great environment! I love the decor and the food is delicious! I got the smoked brisket taco and it lived up to all the rave! My boyfriend ordered the chicken fajita bowl with the creamy rice and it was so good! I fell in love with their dessert blossom tea, if u love u sweet teas this is a must! I will be returning and recommending to friends! Great job!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, although it can get a little crowded during the busy days. The rice and the cheese dip is amazing! I would recommend it either for a date or casual dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Some of best fried tacos I've ever had in my life. With a hip decor comboed with great drink specials and a unique spin on Mexican cuisine,makes this a must eat restaurant. The only thing stopping me from giving it the 5 star rating is it's music selection can be a little depressing. I like things upbeat when I'm drinking tequila!"}
{"text":"Decent. That about sums it up. $9-11 for well prepared, good sized, a-la carte burritos. Nothing special. Chips had good flavor. Nice selection of salsas though the pico was unnecessary.  Arrived after 9 for dinner. Mostly empty. The servers were paying a ton of attention to a table of 20-something (age) women.They were all laughing and having a grand time.  Service was polite. Just OK. Only attempt to up sell was guac for $9. Tasty and a good portion. Fair. Drink refills were slow. When not paying attention to the pretty women, workers seemed most interested in the TVs in the bar. No suggestion of dessert.  2nd time here. And, yeah: decent."}
{"text":"I have to say I am pleasantly surprised with my change of heart! The manager contacted me and apologized for my unpleasant experience, sent me a gift certificate for the trouble, and when I went back, the food and service surpassed my expectations. I could feel a different energy and quality in the place!  I really appreciate the customer service turn around, it really showed me how much they care."}
{"text":"Open for lunch!  Trendy and comfortable, it is a great experience with awesome service.  The owner, Lenny, even came to the table to ask how we were doing.  Fresh chips and salsa's started our lunch with a yummy taco and bean/rice sides.  Wish we could have enjoyed an adult beverage at the beautiful bar but work calls.  Next time!"}
{"text":"Wow!! My new favorite hot spot for Great Mexican food. I think this is my 5th time here.  I don't have a favorite because I'm trying different dishes, if I  had to pick one I would pick the beef burito Christmas style, Yum!! Great vibe, service and yes homemade  chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks. Miss the old Revo Burrito for the convenience of pick up and ordering and being open 7 days a week but the new redone Mexx 32 is growing on me."}
{"text":"I suddenly realized how much I've been missing out on, and I only did take out!  First off, service was great, fast and flawless. Take out order was exactly as we had asked and ready and hot when we arrived. Not only that, but everything was packed with care, silverware, tortillas, you name it! So nice for a quick grab-and-go dinner!   Chips and salsa with the take-out order? Heck yes! Love that they give you this and it's not an add on, but automatic.  The  chips and salsa are wonderful! The darker one is mild, the bright red one requires some tolerance for heat! Both had great flavor.  The green chili pork burrito bowl was fantastic, again has some kick to it! I added black beans for pure perfection. I also love that they don't skimp on the portions. Word to the wise, burrito bowl is not great for take-out. Not because it was bad, but the generous portions aren't super portable. It was wonderful, but just know it's not exactly mess-free. I still loved every bite!   Can't wait to come back and dine-in! The ambience was fun and inviting, looking forward to a future date night!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in from Florida late one evening last week and decided to eat here before our 2 Hour drive to Sedona.  We used yelp to find a good restaurant to eat and decided on this place because of all of the great reviews it got. It definitely lived up to the reviews! We did the any three taco special and did a combination of the pulled pork, steak, brisket, and mushroom and to say it was good is an understatement. These tacos are fresh and delicious. They are definitely not your typical fried and greasy Mexican food. It is fresh and light while delicious and filling. The ambience was really nice, the bathrooms were clean, and our server was wonderful! I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Trendy Mexican restaurant. We were at the Biltmore for a conference and decided to sneak away somewhere close for some Mexican. The atmosphere is open and inviting and service very friendly. Now for the food...not the best, not the worst.  But as East-coasters visiting Phoenix we expected a lot more from a Mexican restaurant rated 4.5 stars.   Chips and salsa: excellent.  3 different salas, and fresh, warm, salty chips.  Good start.  Guacamole: meh. It was not as fresh as we expected, and lacked flavor. Portion is generous, however, and when combined with the salsas went down easy.  Tacos: some standouts, some good. Standouts were the Mahi mahi and smoked brisket. The smoked pork was good but not memorable. Corn tortillas were excellent. The veggies/extras/sauces for the tacos seemed a bit of an afterthought.   Overall, 3.5 stars. Great service, good food. But we were hoping for waaaaaay more from a Mexican restaurant less than 2 hours from the US-Mexican border."}
{"text":"I just used uber eats and had a Mahi Mahi bowl delivered.  Omg that was incredible! Super flavorful,  large chunks of fish,  and that rice! Wow! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome !!! After months and months ... What felt like years we finally made it back to the old revo burrito!!! We used to go here all the time ....  The food was great !!! The only slip was that they have taken the hard shell tacos off the menu as an option ;(  Food is fresh, simple and everything u want for a mex fix!!!  The service was exceptional !!! Our server Patrick was sweet, fast, kind, funny and a true pro !!! Thanks !!!"}
