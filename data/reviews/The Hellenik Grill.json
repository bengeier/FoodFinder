{"text":"This was awesome ! Quick delivery, great salad with the best greek dressing I've had in ages.  Great delivery service...can't recommend enough.  Had the greek salad with chicken"}
{"text":"I would have given it one star but the food is amazing. Unfortunately there are new owners and they've raised the already ridiculously high prices. Food is phenomenal but NOT worth the money. 6$ for a chicken skewer which has 4 pieces of chicken. Prices on their website are incorrect."}
{"text":"I wish I still lived a block from this place! It's one thing I miss about the old 'hood. We lived off their daily lunch specials and dinner platters the last few months we were in the area.  Souvlakia dinner platters are large, reasonably priced, super fresh and tasty. The rice can be a little oily and bland, so I usually substitute it for extra roasted potatoes. Oh, I love those potatoes. I only wish they were more lemon-y.  I can also vouch for the perfectly seasoned and tender chicken souvlakia. The lamb falls off the stick with tenderness. Thumbs-up on the gyros from my husband, too. Of the sauces and dips on offer, the tzatziki is my favorite but the taramosalata is intense and tasty, too.  Thick burgers with feta and olives, served on toasted pita = genius.   The owner is very friendly and the place feels comfortable in the neighborhood, even though it's relatively new and not of the high-falutin' sit-down variety. It's easy to find yourself chatting with neighbors and joking with the eager-to-please (family?) staff.  If you need a quick, fresh, relatively healthy (ish!) takeout lunch or dinner in, skip the 23 greasy pizza/pasta options and overpriced Indian and head to the Hellenik Grill.  Tip: they're open Mondays, unlike most restaurants on this strip of Yonge."}
{"text":"First time at The Hellenik Grill.  We were 2 and ordered the following:  1 chicken souvlaki 1 pork souvlaki 1order of fries 1small village salad  Total price $31.70  Food was pretty good except for village salad.  Over powered by cucumbers.  I didn't think a village salad had cucumbers.  The price did shock me.  We didn't order much but the price seemed out of the norm.  When we asked if the price was right, the woman who seemed to be the owner looked at the register and told us the price was correct.  However she did this with the attitude of a Greek taxi drivers in the Greek islands. if you ever been to the Greek islands, you know what I mean.  She basically was extremely bothered by our question and for having been disturbed from whatever she was doing on the kitchen counter.  Seemed like she was cutting things, not sure."}
{"text":"Great food, a little pricey, terrible service. I called in to order a pickup and right from the start they were rude. They were talking which seemed to be a friend on the side while I was trying to place the order. When I went to go pick it up they messed up the order. Expected since the guy who took the order didn't seem to be paying attention. The what seemed to be the manager apologized and rolled her eyes at the young man who took the order. I could only assume that the young man was the owners son."}
{"text":"While the name has always remained the same - the ownership and/or management hasn't. The two lads who ran this place back in 2010 were simply the best. They offered great service, great food, they always remembered your name and it just had what you were looking for in an authentic Greek establishment.   Unfortunately management changed hands a few years ago and this place hasn't been the same. Had an issue with management a few years ago and stayed away until very recently. Nothing has changed!  While the food is mostly bang on (not quite as good as before however) it is still better than those mall outfits and franchised Greek locals here in TO. Where's the issue and why the low rating? The management!! It needs some major revamping and a few lessons on how to properly interact with their customers. Two recent visits and not too impressed. The one lady working there is quite rude and seemed very ungrateful for my business.   I'll probably go back again in the fall and reevaluate but this is definitely NOT my first choice for Greek food in Toronto."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant in person but I ordered delivery.  It arrived hot and on time.  I had the chicken pita with fries and it was tasty and filling without being too heavy. It was healthy, homey food and I would definitely recommend it!  Note: Chicken and beef are kosher (with exception of the gyro which is not kosher)"}
{"text":"Great food. Went on a Sunday night and they are very friendly and great service.  I had the lamb souvlaki on a pita with French fries.....excellent flavour. My wife had a pork souvlaki dinner and a Greek salad....loved it too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for take-out one weeknight. I ordered a chicken souvlaki in a pita and \"Greek\" fries. The pita was rather small and very bland. The Greek fries were barely fried (they were white and floppy - no sexual jokes please). This meal took more than 20 minutes. Service was pleasant - no complaints there. I probably won't return. Can't imagine waiting this long for an unsatisfying meal. With 18% tip, it cost me $18.00"}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat, I ordered online, and picked up my food. The restaurant is hidden on a side street. There is a small eating area inside, and large patio, located in a very nice neighbourhood. The food was good, my Chicken sandwich was well cooked, and flavourful. The Greek poutine, with Feta Cheese was fantastic! a great dish, and must try. It contained a large portion of cheese and fries. Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Plenty of Greek restaurants in Toronto, authenticity in the Danforth neighborhood or fast food kind sold in styrofoam at malls. Who doesn't love the balance of protein, greens and carbs, right? A bit stung after a 'delivery' experience here at Hellenik though.   Hellenik Grill is owned by the real deal Greek family who possess no amount of patience I find as a quality in my Godfather from Athens. Overconfidence in their memory though, that they have, backed up with lies.  You see, I placed an order for 3 meals with 3 pops and the rude male patron over the phone insisted I placed no such request for pops. (Even though it was clear on the receipt handed over by the delivery guy stuck between honesty and keeping his job) He had to go to the nearest convenience store, poor guy, to purchase the pops to console his boss' bruised ego.  Looong waits for your food and missing items you've already paid for with a hint of B1tch on the side. Next!"}
{"text":"Simple, yet delicious.  I love the chicken souvlaki pita with fries lunch special.  They are always super nice and friendly.  Very sweet to kids."}
{"text":"Completely shocked by the relatively low rating. Only ordered from here once but it may have very well been the best chicken souvlaki pita I've ever had..."}
{"text":"ILl have to agree with the positive reviews of this place. It is really good. Now to add; stay away from the salads, as these guys think that a salad is meant to be marinated in olive oil and no lemon or vinegar, upon asking for vinegar i got some cheesy kraft dinner greek dressing, horrific (at $7 bucks a salad i was a bit taken back). My buddies burger looked epic and my gyro was really damn good. The proprietors of this place are straight up greek, ie: really no people skills what so ever, they should be back of the house guys and there should be somebody a bit more service oriented minding the front, but hey whatcha gonna do. I will return to try a burger once a week."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for a quick bite.  Its nothing special.  Wouldn't return, except as noted below.  As my dining companion put it, \"well, its better than Jimmy the Greek\".  High praise, indeed.  Very small seating area (maybe 8 seats).  Mostly a takeout place.  My lamb souvlaki on a pita was mediocre, too much tzaziki.  The pork dinner of my friend was average - he liked the potatos, nothing special on the meat.  If you have 4 or 5 people they have some dinners for groups of that size for very reasonable prices to take out - might be worth a shot."}
{"text":"Normally I enjoy this place but tried placing an order and guy on phone was rude. Felt like whatever question you asked was just beneath him or he just didn't have the time.    Next time I ordered they were out of a lot of items and still crappy service. Not sure how they are surviving there."}
