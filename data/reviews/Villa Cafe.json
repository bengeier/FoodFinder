{"text":"Many years ago, my mechanic told me to get a coffee here while he changed the oil of my car.  Dive caf√© that features a beautiful and serious looking espresso machine, and a proud old man.  He made the Java.  He talked me into getting an espresso instead of coffee.  The rest is history.  

This *was* my secret espresso place, until Chris told the Yelp world about its existence.  Frankly, does the old man look like he needs more money?  No.  He looks like he freaking owns the building, and is just killing time here with his old friends.  And keep an eye on an Italian young lad who sits there often.  And serve the occasional lost souls who wander through his door.

P.S. I often wonder what goes down in the nice seating room in the back.  Take a peek."}
{"text":"This little cafe is hidden away right behind Big Bones and Wicked Wings. According to the sign its been there since 2003. This place felt like I was walking into an episode of the Sopranos. Outside the cafe I see a group of Italian's in their 40's to 50's having a passionate discussion. You can hear curse words and their outdoor voices were definitely being utilized. But turns out they were just having a casual discussion. I walk inside and see more people of the same age playing cards and enjoying some coffee. There is only about 3-4 tables upon entrance and a few bar stools. Towards the back of the cafe there are many more tables BUT there is a large sign above the entrance that says \"Members Only.\" - I wonder to myself, how I can become a member.

I order up a cappuccino for $3.50 - The gentleman behind the counter made it right in front of me and it looked like it was done to perfection. He scooped up some foam into my cup and poured the rest of the cappuccino. Then I was asked if I wanted sugar, chocolate powder and cinnamon powder. I said, sure why not.    

The drink was scolding hot and I burned my tongue. It was served in a small styrofoam cup and I took it to go as there were no more seats available in the non-members area. Don't be deterred by the styrofoam cup. The cappuccino was excellent and I wish it came in a larger size. I would put this cappuccino up against any of the chained coffee joints any day of the week. 

The place may sound intimidating but its a great place for a caffeinated drink. I did not see any food or snack items so if your hungry then this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"Their cold espresso is delicious, even my sister who hates coffee loved their cold espresso. I really liked their cappuccino and my brother liked their double shot of espresso. This is by far my favorite coffee shop."}
