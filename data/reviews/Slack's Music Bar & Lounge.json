{"text":"Used to be great a few years ago, has gone way downhill. Staff is slow, sulky, rude, esp security ppl. They hate transwomen & xdressers & drag queens & turn em away @ the door, (solidarity wut?) place is full of old cougars & pushy gaybies, DJs are mostly crap. 

AVOID LIVE MUSIC @ ALL COSTS unless you like mediocrity. Crap overpriced food. Drinks also overpriced. Bathrooms not accessible to ppl w disabilities & smell like raw sewage. Whole place feels dirty. Real bad vibe, total downer just walkin in the door. I went a couple weeks ago, ATM was broken & their card thing @ the bar was too, had to go get cash @ the bank on the corner. Sketchy.

Sum up? Overpriced, rude staff, bad food, bad music, bad vibe. Don't waste yr time, ladies, esp if there's a cover charge - maybe Crews or Alto or the west end. Oh yah - & no patio!!"}
{"text":"The door person waa very rude and was not going to let me in because I had a guy with me. Then after some convincing he let us in and said \"you better not be some creepy straight guy.\" So rude. I will never go back. Djs suck too same set list every week and they cant transition songs well at all."}
{"text":"Beware as even though they have a Scoutmob the weirdo owner decided he was not going to honor it fully and said alcohol cannot be discounted. None of that was written in the Scoutmob deal details. Food very average..."}
{"text":"I like this place over all but it is so small. I wish it was bigger. There are all kinds of different women. 

I do love the fact that this is a Women bar. We dont have enough of these in Toronto"}
{"text":"Given the lack of lady-loving-lady bars in the city, part of the reason this place gets three stars is simply because it exists! 

I find the beer slightly over-priced and they definitely let people jump line which is a pet peeve of mine (that said, I've benefited from this in the past once or twice so I shouldn't complain). 

There is typically cover at the door on the weekends but it is reasonable at $5ish and you don't have to pay extra for coat check. 

The staff are efficient but not overly friendly. The crowd changes from week to week but typically ends up being quite a mixed bag of older and younger, 905ers and locals, which can be pretty nice and keep things interesting. Most people seem open to meeting new people and are pretty friendly. The atmosphere and decor are nice for a Toronto queer bar and the music tends to be pretty good. 

End of the story is simply that it's a safe bet any night of the week if you want to meet a lot of queer women - there aren't that many other bars you can see the same thing about. I find myself here a little more often than I'd like to admit (maybe once a month) but I typically have a rather enjoyable time."}
{"text":"The premier lesbian bar.
yes, it has lesbians.  many of them.  of all types.  you have your butch lesbians, femme lesbians, showgirl lesbians, trans lesbians and even your straight girls who just like hanging out with lesbians.  Yes, this place is a-ok, but not amazing.
The [very small] dance floor is kinda cramped and its hard to get our groove thing on without completely bumpin into the people beside you.  Maybe that's your thing-tight clubs, but I like to have my own space to groove = )

Sexy ladies abound and it's free and easy to get in given you present as a female.
Guys: you MUST enter with a woman- lone men don't usually get in and forget it if you are a group of guys sans girls."}
{"text":"Un bar de lesbienne pour les lesbiennes, parfait donc pour sortir entre filles.

L'endroit est très bien placé à 5 min du métro Wellesley et 10 min à peine de collège st et de son street car qui passe 24h/24.

L'endroit n'est pas trop grand mais on a quand même la place de bouger et danser et surtout l'ambiance est toujours au rendez-vous.

Etape indispensable pour une lesbienne qui vient dans la ville.

Petit plus: le vestiaire est gratuit et tenu par un québécois."}
{"text":"About 4 years ago I started sending Slacks management emails concerning the fact that I think they were on the verge of losing clientele as their DJ choices sucked. Some chick they had spinning the music was whack ! Not gonna call no names, but let's just say the music skills werent as 'Delicious' as that DJ thought they were. 

Fast forward, you drive past that place and you could well do a front flip, two back flips and a cartwheel all in a straight line cause there is barely anyone in there. 

I can only assume that at this point the owner must be rich cause they not staying open from all the booze they selling. 

Just wutless - wish I could put them out of their misery and close the place down. 4 years ago it was a happening place to be in - now it ain't worth a dime. Don't see anything being done to bring the programme segment up to par."}
{"text":"The place is small and cramped. It's kind of disappointing that the best spot for women to party on Church St. is a 2-star (so sad). It's fun at Pride though, but only because the crowd differs from the standard homely types and they try harder with the music. And because it's Pride. I'd go back for Pride (and maybe other times). Usually the staff working the door are friendly.

No cover before 10 or 10:30 on weekends. Drink prices are reasonable. Plastic cups for water smell like chlorine (gross).

No amazing experience here unless you come from a small town."}

I have a lot of lesbian/bisexual friends and it was just a matter of time before one of them were to mention something about going to a gay bar so for one of my friends birthdays, we did just that.

Came early for dinner and ordered a variety of dishes, but I couldn't try them all. I did however have a taste of 2 different pastas...

Gnocci Carbonara 
- first few bites were good, nice soft gnocci but only half way through, and you can see the pool of oil it is drowning in. Big turn off. I did not finish my dish. Not to mention, there wasn't much ingredients either. 

Chicken & Wild Mushroom Penne
- This dish definately had less oil and it was a standard dish with nothing catching my eye or tastebuds. 

Drinks
- The martinis and cocktails are definately pricey here

With the food out of the way, let's talk about the actual space and what not. It's a nice cozy place and we were placed in a corner space which was great because it was close to the washroom and the DJ. After 10p.m, a flood of people started to fill the room and THAT'S when the party started. We actually came here for the 'club' and not the food anyway. Let me tell you, it was live!!! Lots of girls dancin' and grindin' on eachother. I actually had a ton of fun and I was tipsy. Tee hee.

Overall: I heard it's $2.50 martinis on Tuesdays, but if you want something L I V E then I suggest you go on the weekend or a Friday."}
{"text":"I went to Slack's last night with a bunch of girls (all gay) and my husband and it was a is a pretty good time. It's a small bar at the corner of Church and Wellesley with a mix of young and old lesbians with a few guys sprinkled in the mix (FYI there is an enforced 2 girls for every one guy ratio at the door). 

We strolled in at midnight on a Saturday with no cover and no lineups. The drinks are moderately priced (about $5-$6) and I didn't wait long at the one long bar to get served but I found my rum and coke a bit watered down.  I am usually not a fan of top 40's music but there was a good mix of old school hip hop like Ol Dirty Bastard!

As the best (and possibly only all lesbian bar) in the village it was a good time and safe space for me and my friends."}
