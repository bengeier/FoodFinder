{"text":"This is a really nice looking place,  I really enjoyed the ambiance.  It is not too loud and not too dark or bright.  There is a lot of attention to detail.

So much potential; but their kitchen preparation needs an overhaul.  We had multiple things that were not good.  I found my arugula salad to be inedible because it was sopping in oil and there was no vinegar/acid to cut it.  The arancini were awful (bland fried blobs of rice/risotto without enough sauce, cheese or basil).  Entree was mediocre at best.  I hate to be so critical, but their food was not good.  I left here feeling real hungry. 

Might be a great place to drink, but I would absolutely skip a meal here."}
{"text":"The chicken paprikash is an epiphany!! I don't know how they crisp the accompanying spaeztles but the dish is sumptuous and satisfying, a delicate fusion of a traditional dish made with modern elegance. No matter how much the menu tempts me, I cannot resist this dish!! 
Great wine list, fantastic service, gracious decor- a certain recipe for a great success!! And I applaud the owners for standing in the foreground of revitalizing a fantastic neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to experience The Standard.  The décor was impressive, but there were pros and cons with the food.  I had the Chicken Paprikash which was vey good.  My friend had the special of the day, Pan Seared Salmon on a bed of Brussel sprout greens.  The salmon was seared nicely but the inside was mushy and undercooked and the greens were tough and uneventful.  I liked the idea of small and large plate options for the entrees.  Our server was very friendly and attentive and service was prompt.  Since we were there for lunch, we had no problem being seated immediately.  We had little problem finding a street parking space, but I can see where that could be an issue if you do not chose valet service.  I guess they are working on improving that problem.  We would go back to try other suggested selections."}
{"text":"Short version: don't bother. 

Slightly longer version: Went in for the first time and were completely underwhelmed. A very weak knock-off of pseudo-inventive bland nouveau American fare, overpriced, under-flavored, and utterly tired. Menu reminiscent of Deagan's on Cleveland's west side, but the execution is lacking. The brussel sprouts were greasy, the cauliflower were dry, and the oysters were anorexic. 

To make matters worse, although the waitress seemed to only have one table (we were there on a Monday), we were waited on by the bartender. Not surprisingly, he was uninformed about the food and strangely awkward at the table. It was an off-night for us too, so some amount of slack should be given, but still: at least he could have poured the wine and lit the candle. 

It would be nice to see this place and this neighborhood do well. Alas, rather than reaching a happy medium, The Standard merely distends towards the sagging middle."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Montreal, all categories included. I have gone out of my way and/or walked for 45 minutes just to come by for a coffee here. I've brought a lot of people here and everyone loved it. The baristas are great (especially Kento, James and Joe). 
They're all super nice and knowledgeable. I also like that they switch up their beans on a regular basis. Always something new to try. :-) 
The decor and ambience is on point too, looooove the herringbone flooring. The only bad thing is that there are no hooks (for purses and jackets/coats) in the bathroom. :-(

Edited to add baristas' names"}
{"text":"Been here two or three times now. The kitchen does good work. Food comes out hot and in a timely fashion. The Slovenian sausage, salumi and cheese board, ricotta spaetzel, short ribs, chicken Milanese, and salads were all delicious. Yesterday, my wife and I went with another couple who are excellent cooks and tough critics. They were pleased as well.

More attentive service would've been nice. But this place was getting busy at 5:00. That means it's good. In our servers defense she wasn't leaning on the bar on her phone joking around with co workers, she was running around making drinks, serving, etc. I respect hard work. 

Will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Good quality food, excellent service and warm inviting atmosphere.   The outdoor seating was as elegant as indoor. 

Food is smoked onsite. The delicious flavors are impressive."}
{"text":"Expensive espresso $3.75 wow
Not worth it.must be the high rent on Sherbrooke street."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, and friendly staff. The macaroni and cheese is one of the best I've ever had (and I've tried a lot!) and the cauliflower is so good too. Menu has a lot of variety on it and everyone at our table loved what they ordered. Only small complaint would be I wish they had more seasonal changes in their menu. So excited to see such a stand out restaurant open and thriving on 185th."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. 

Food-great ingredients and very flavorful. Try the arancini and the baby kale salad. Dressing was amazing. 

Service-excellent.

I love the open kitchen. You can sit at the kitchen table. Great atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"This place is sadly overrated. I'm new to the neighborhood so I thought I would check it out. People have said it's pretty good. It looks great. The staff looks great. But the food, service and attitude are below what you'd expect in a place with such nice atmosphere. I have been there twice now. The first time was on a Saturday night about 10 pm. The place was near empty and cleared out before I got my food (a burger and fries)...nothing great. The next time, I was the LONE customer (I mean crickets) on a Sunday evening about 8pm. I ordered the seared tuna and a side of fries. The tuna must have just been taken out of the fridge and thrown on a plate because there's no way that gray piece of unseasoned fish had seen heat in days. Seared? Not a chance. The tuna should be seasoned, seared and then sliced into medallions. It should be near sushi red on the inside and served with some sort of dipping sauce. And the cup of cold fries (for $5) clearly came from the bottom of the fry bin. I understand the bearded cook wanted to go home...but it's shortcuts like that that lose a business a potentially regular customer. This is how restaurants die. I live down the block from this place. I could be swinging in there 2-3x week on my way home for a quick bite or a few pints but now I will never go back there again. The manager/owner sits at the bar and flirts with the wait staff. I am the only customer. He waits till I'm out the door to scream an empty 'have a good night' at me. This is how you treat your customers? Perhaps a more conscientious cook works during other hours but just knowing the attitude of management...as long as everything LOOKS good, it's OK...falls short of making me ever go back and give them another try."}
{"text":"When my fiancé and I arrived on a Friday night at 8, we were greeted by a pretentious hostess who expressed her displeasure with us for not having made a reservation. While the \"greeting\" was a turn off, our waitress was warm and friendly and quickly put us in better spirits. We ordered the cauliflower which was al dente and slightly sweet as an appetizer followed by the scallops and tuna entrees which were light and delicious. We loved the food and friendly service. Had the hostess been pleasant, we would've given it five stars."}
{"text":"On Sunday we were looking for a good restaurant for 5 of us  to go to prior to an afternoon theater performance.  A number of places  we wanted to try were closed.  Then I remembered a positive  review of \"The Standard\" on E. 185th  and that several other people had good things to say about the restaurant.

We are really happy we went there for a number of reasons.  First, they are so conveniently located right off I-90.   Secondly, the food and service was excellent!  I love the fact they offer 1/2 portions which all 5 of us had and  they were ample with the delicious, warm bread.  

Third, Bridget, our server, was lovely and very responsive to all our requests.  Fourth, they have done a very nice job with the interior of the building and it is great to see more good restaurants in this area.  Lastly, a restaurant with this quality of food, fair wine prices, and a menu with creative offerings that is open on a Sunday is really a find. Let's make sure everyone knows about their hours (currently open Sunday for an early lunch and until 10 PM) so we can continue to have this excellent Sunday option!

BTW, I seldom give out 5's.  Maybe one more trip back there and I'll update this review if warranted."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge burger person, but they got it down. Cooked correctly and service was fast."}
{"text":"Visited on a cold snowy night with an old friend. We grew up together in the area and I love seeing new places opening up. We ordered several small plates and shared. The Brussels sprouts were outstanding, as was the Mac and Cheese. We were both really happy with the meal and I'd definitely go back.The cocktails are maybe a little over priced, but the wine and beer lists are totally reasonable. The service was friendly and hospitable, and the open kitchen was a nice touch. All in all, a great dining experience."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch on a Sunday, so glad they were open. Delicious food with great flavor!  Had the shrimp with grits, a touch of spice with bits of chorizo, perfect.  Others had the lamb meatballs with tsaziki sauce over pasta, interesting combo and a burger."}
{"text":"We took a chance and tried The Standard last week and were so pleasantly surprised that we returned last night. 
Not a bad dish to be found on the menu, with the stroganoff and lamb dishes particularly good. Attentive service and very attractive, yet simple decor. 
Finally, the bread pudding is actually he best I've ever had. 
We wish them luck - a great addition to a neighborhood in need of something new!"}
{"text":"Black and gold palettes make me think simultaneously of art deco and Kate Spade. In this gorgeous coffee shop, the palette drew me in and made me worry momentarily as to whether I'd be dealing with pretentious baristas who'll silently judge what I'm wearing and what I'm ordering. 

Thankfully, I was saved. The barista who cheerfully greeted me was fantastic and made a great cappuccino. They also had some fresh goods from Hof Kelsten.  Will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and friendly staff. Loved our fall cocktails, and the apple bread pudding was amazing!"}
{"text":"Went for first time. On our 14th anniversary.
Wonderful atmosphere, service and food. Especially loved the brussel sprouts.
To make the experience even better after liking them on Facebook we won a gift certificate for being their 2000th like.
Great evening, we will return!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend made a reservation for us on a Wednesday at 6:30PM. When we walked in we weren't greeted, we had to initiate the conversation and let them know why we were there. Our server wasn't friendly but we looked past it. We started with \"snacks\" on their menu. I ordered the stuffed Arancini and my boyfriend got the French fries. The stuffed Arancini was delicious, the marinara sauce really topped it off. The French fries were mediocre to me but my boyfriend enjoyed them. We then moved onto our entrees, I ordered The Standard Burger with bacon and cheddar. I asked for no onions or tomatoes and when I opened the burger it had onions and tomatoes but I didn't even bother telling the waitress. My boyfriend ordered the Spaetzel which on the menu has duck in it but we were informed there wasn't duck in the dish anymore. They should really change the menus to reflect that. The waitress walked past our table multiple times and disregarded our empty drink cups. Nice looking place, I wouldn't be upset if I didn't get to go back. Service 3/5, food 3/5."}
{"text":"We tried The Standard last night with good friends who are always on the lookout for an exceptional meal. Everyone was happy with their dishes! What a great place, and we're so lucky to have it so close to home.
The crowd last night was similar to what you would find at Bistro 185 or Grovewood, maybe a little older. No big deal. Our waitress was friendly and full of suggestions. The restaurant space itself is beautiful. 
The beets are seriously to die for, if you're into beets. If you're not, try them anyways, you may become a fan. The Lamb Balls and Spaghetti was a tasty little dish. The small portion was more than enough. And, the bread pudding was just as fantastic as all you other Yelp reviewers made it out to be. Heaven. 
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try last week Monday because it was close to home and the reviews were great. Thanks Yelp!!
It was half price bottles of wine night which was wonderful!!
The atmosphere inside is cozy and I love the decor. It was laid back and relaxing. Just what we were looking for.

More importantly, the food was AMAZING!! We expected it to be good but we were blown away with just how good it all was!!

We started with the Crispy Arancini, Grilled Halloumi and the Shredded Brussels Sprouts. The Arancini balls were crisp on the outside and tender in the middle. Expertly prepared. The Halloumi was even better. It came with pistachios, spicy peppers and a balsamic glaze. It was magical!! 

By this time we were so full but once we had tried the sauce that came under the Arancini, we knew we had to try the Spaghetti Bolognese. We got that and the Chicken Spaetzel. 
The Bolognese was everything I could have ever wanted it to be and much more then I expected!!! From the first bite I had already wished I had just ordered that. It was heaven and as soon as we get another chance, we will be returning just for that!! Get it, you won't regret it.

By this time we were beyond full but they have Bread Pudding on the menu. We ordered it to go and ended up eating it the next day. It was great even reheated!!!

Go here, run if you must.

Our server was kind, sweet and knowledgeable and the food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Tried The Standard last night with friends.  Just loved it!!!
A welcome addition to the neighborhood.
I had the shrimp and grits.  OMG! Delicious. Portion small, but that's me.
The salmon and steamed mussels my friends had seemed very generous.
If you can please a table of 7, you are doing a great job.
The bread pudding to die for especially with the scoop of sea salt caramel 
ice cream on top.
Great waitress!  Just great.
Owner present and greeted us coming and going.  Nice, nice touch.
Would go back in a second.  Will recommend to all my friends.
Thanks for coming to 185th!!!!
Loved seeing the cooks in the front window.
Two thumbs up!!!!!!

Hoping parking won't be a problem down the road.
This place is going to be very popular!

{"text":"Live a couple miles away and finally got to this local gem.   Several locals have told us this place had great food.  Sometimes you try a new place and you comb over the 10-15 items on the menu struggling to find something that clicks.  This is the opposite, at least for me.   Almost every item on the Menu looked good to us, for one reason or another.   Don't be scared off by the \"Plates\" approach.  Two of us split 1 appetizer,  2 small-sized plates, and split a nice Wedge salad - and we were totally satisfied (full !).   Speaking of appetizer, I love chicken livers (properly prepared) and you don't see them very often.  Get them here !   It was a very generous portion served \"southern fried\" creatively with grits and mild peppers.  Excellent.  Will definitely return to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I wish I could come eat here every night for dinner but that would be a trek from the west side - might have to move to Euclid I guess! Last night was my second time and I haven't had one thing that wasn't amazing. We split the scallops, short rib stroganoff, brussel sprouts and oysters - everything was delicious! The service is also attentive and the owner or manager touched every table more than once. Such a nice gesture on a busy Saturday night."}
{"text":"I heard about the Standard from a friend who grew up in the neighborhood, now further suburban. He had been there twice and loved it. I went there for lunch 3 days ago with a friend, had the wedge salad and chicken liver with grits. Both were superb and definitely a hearty meal. Service was great, ambiance excellent. Iced tea was pineapple flavored, not sweet, not my favorite. Wonderful black and white photography of the steel mill area at night tops it off...along with a photograph of Danny Green indicating the men's room! 
I came back with my wife last night, food and service again excellent. She had the beet salad and small scallop plate. Perfectly prepared, though she preferred other veggies as a base for the scallops. I had the Brussels sprouts as an appetizer and the short rib beef Stroganoff, small size again. Perfection. The small plates left room for dessert, though we almost never have dessert. My wife had a lemon tart which was wonderful and I had the bread pudding with carmel salt ice cream; a hearty portion which I couldn't finish, also very good. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Probably has one of the best charcuterie and cheese boards around. Food is pretty good. Bartenders know their cocktails. Menu could change more frequently. Kinda pricey. Great for appetizers and mixed drinks."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Perfection!  Great service, not rushed, attentive bartender. And the food was amazing. Tried 5 or 6 small dishes including mussels, brussel sprouts, red beets, smoked salmon and more.  Really delicious. Going back to try everything I didn't have room for tonite! A treasure!  Love the ambiance and b/w industrial yet artsy photographs on the walls."}
{"text":"When I saw the pictures online, I had high expectations about Standard. I was even exited to go and see \"a huge high end black and gold decor, fancy coffee place\". 
It was a big disappointment.

You come in and the AC wasn't working.

The place is tiny, with a coffee machine, and a vitrine with several kind of pastries, croissant , donuts and tarts. 
Standard doesn't do his own pastry. He gets them from other pastries like Hof kelsten and Trou de beigne . 

The place has a  dirty floor. The tables are not clean.

There is no service, you pick your coffee from the counter. 
Lets say this place is for a grab and go coffee shop. 

The latte I took was really good. The americano not very. The croissant nature was crunchy."}
{"text":"The Standard is great! I've been there numerous times and it never disappoints. 

The Brussels Sprouts dish is outstanding! Highly recommend. The Mac & Cheese is rich and creamy, the bacon adds just the right balance. 

The atmosphere is cozy and beautifully appointed. Service is good, the wait staff and owner are very friendly. Great place. Can't wait for the patio!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and the ambiance is great. I was here for a dinner party with a total of 8 people. Our server was great and the food arrived quickly. Since we had a large party I was able to taste a lot of the menu items. Here's what I tried;
1. Crab Cake- amazing! I'm pretty picky about my crab cakes since I lived in the Maryland/DC area and these are yummy.
2. Slovenian Sausage- yummy
3. Shredded Brussels Sprouts- YUM YUM YUM
4. Sirloin- yummy
5. Short Rib Stroganoff...I will be getting this every time I come to this place. 
6. Mac n' Cheese- Yummy
Some other people in my party tried the tuna and oysters and they had no complaints. 

The most amazing thing about this place is one of the bartenders. He is a very tall man with a full head of thick black hair and the most amazing beard I have ever seen. He looks like something out of a marvel comic's movie...and I mean that in a good way. I full intend on going back with my single girlfriends for the eye candy."}
{"text":"I was hoping dinner would've been better with all of these good yelp reviews. It was marginally OK. The outdoor seating on the patio was wonderful. The server was OK. I am guessing she was very busy. She didn't really stop back to check on things very often. If she had we might've ordered more drinks. The wedge salad was very disappointing. Tasted OK but was expecting all the ingredients that are normally on a wedge. Had to add a lot of salt. The shaved brussels sprouts were OK and needed a lot of salt two. Had shrimp and grits for an entrée. Very disappointing. The grits had zero flavor. Everything was sitting in a puddle of butter. Needed a lot of salt again. I am giving it two stars because we got a nice discount on our meal and drinks because of happy hour. Would I go back? For drinks only."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here before a concert at Beachland and had a wonderful experience. We sat on the patio (we were the ony ones). The bar area looked like it hadn't been completed but the patio is nice. It has white string lights that hang from the fence and they grow their own herbs. We were there on a Monday night and there were only about 6 people other than us. Not sure if that's usual but I hope it gets busy on other days.

We started with drinks and and the Arancini appetizer. The arancini was not as hot as we would have liked it to be but was still delicious. The sauce that was served with it was great! Our waitress was fantastic at explaining different dishes and giving her recommendations and that is how I chose the Chicken Milanese for my entree. The chicken is deep fried but topped with a delicious light salad. I loved it! My boyfriend ordered the burger and it was a bit of a letdown. The burger looked like it could have started out as a frozen patty but I also think since he ordered it medium well that it took out a lot of the flavor. 

Their menu changes with seasons so my recommendation is to order something that you can't get at every other restaurant. 


Note: All day Monday they have 1/2 off bottles of wine"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and decent Soya cappuccino!

Good for meetings and/or working/studying!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Our first visit.  Drinks were very generous, service by Mackenzie was excellent and our food was excellent.  Can hardly wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in the middle of nowheresville Collinwood.  I love finding places like this in transitional neighborhoods.  Exposed brick walls, black tablecloths.  Pulled pork sandwich with fries was awesome.  The Pat LaFreida burger was killer, killer good.  The best thing on the table for me?  The house-made ketchup.  Yowza...outstanding.  Service was attentive.  Cool interior and good wine list.  Sit in the back at the open kitchen.  Next time I will order the crab cake or order a nice salumi and cheese plate.  Food menu is highly inspired and delicious."}
{"text":"One of the best \"let's give it a shot\" experiences I've had in a long time. The atmosphere is tasteful and the huge wooden bar will probably be our new watering hole. Our server was nice and very attentive, even letting us relax and talk over our bottle of wine before bringing out the first course. 

My fiancé ordered the brussel sprouts and the spaetzel. The sprouts were a larger portion than we expected so it went unfinished but she really enjoyed the spaetzel. The combination of duck confit, charred cabbage and goat cheese gave it an earthy, smoky flavor. Personally I thought it was a little dry and could've used some kind of drizzle or sauce but it was still good. 

I ordered the crispy arancini which were fried very well with large parmesan shavings. The spicy tomato sauce on the arancini convinced me to order the spaghetti bolognese. One bite of the bolognese and I knew I was coming back to this place. Easily one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had and I immediately regretted ordering the small serving. I thought it would be the same spicy sauce from the appetizer with some meat added in but it was so much more than that. I was swirling my bread around in the bowl to get every last bit. 

Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Mostly because Olivia is the Bar Manager, along with an all star cast including her sister Mackenzie and Courtney.  Ilene is also up there.  My favorite is the shrimp and grits and the special sauce that they have for the oysters.  Their cocktails and charcuterie boards are to die for which was our initial draw.  We had no problem with the portion sizes, although we've never ordered to-go."}
{"text":"When The Standard opened I was so impressed because living in Euclid, we never had a decent restaurant. I grew up in Mexico City , one of largest and most metropolitan cities in the world, and the cuisine is magnificent.At the time they opened their chef was fabulous, and his menu terrifique. I loved going there at least once a week. However, after aprox. a year or a little more, Tim Bando, ( who opened his own restaurant in Chagrin falls) left , the restaurant started to go down in quality and not a high standard in many of the ingredients or changes in the recipes. The service is not as fabulous as it was. Food is not served at it should:  \"HOT\" ......and in gral. it is not a fabulous restaurant as it used to be. Yes three star and i am being real generous. i would go somewhere else before The Standard."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough. Was not expecting to have such an experience this evening but I'm glad I went. Beverages were on point and the food followed suit."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, we were uncertain about The Standard. Boy, were we glad we threw sub-par reviews to the wind and gave it a chance! Delicious. We were visiting from out of town and went on a Sunday. Thinking it was going to be packed, we were there right at 11 a.m. when they opened and, to our surprise, were the only ones there the entire time. Score! Our awesome server, Bridget, said around 1 p.m. there's a big after-church crowd; and pretty much every evening is slammed. So, best advice is to go during off hours. 

First, the bread. Hot, delicious. I know, it's just free bread, but this stuff was addicting. We ordered the arancini, which was my favorite order of the day. I wanted more. The sauce, the meat, the flavoring; all perfection. I'd have had three orders of that and called it a day :) 

My husband and I split two entrees: shrimp and grits, and chicken paprikash. The grits were good. Pretty good. But not great. I've had better grits, but the shrimp was on-point. Oh, and it had bacon bits in it. Mmm. The chicken paprikash was a hit. They were whole legs of chicken (two of then on the 'small' size order). Goodness, was this a great meal. Slow-roasted, bone-in chicken that literally fell right off the bone. 

The Bloody Mary was yummy; but, really, I've rarely had a Mary that didn't please. LOL. In short, definitely, absolutely go to The Standard. If we lived there, it would be our standard!"}
{"text":"In the area for a day and decided to check this place out after looking at the great reviews. Definitely agree with high ratings. I had the sirloin, which was perfectly cooked, and Arancini (fried rice balls) for appetizer which was delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was lamenting the closing of a nearby 3rd wave café for a long time until I saw that renovations had begun just a block down on a 4TH WAVE shop called The Standard. 

What is 4th wave you might ask? According to the staff it's a marriage between specialty coffee, fashion, and art. Looking around at the array of filters, hardcore espresso puller, sleek black walls and trendy metallic accents, I believe it. 

I ordered an aeropress and it did not disappoint. They're only using premium beans. Their pastries looked awesome too- all from Hof Kelsten.  I hear they usually carry Trou de Beigne too. We settled for a chocolate chip cookie and it was tasty.  

For your next Tinder date or sexy bff date or quick business meeting or what have you, I highly recommend. Just wear light clothes in the summer... doesn't seem like they've got any AC indoors."}
{"text":"Great option for good food on Cleveland's east side. Go during happy hour for the best prices. Staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"I just ate the redfish, red beans and rice, housemade andouille sausage with fried oyster on top special. I had it last night and it was so good I had to come back and have it for lunch today.. And it was only $14 for a fresh perfectly cooked nice portion of fish."}
{"text":"Best coffee spot we've found in Montreal. Searching out great espresso is a wonderful by product of travel and The Standard Cafe is a 5-star winner. If your purpose is visiting a cafe with an emphasis on the coffee, this is your place.   Definitely worth the 2 stop metro ride from our Air BnB."}
{"text":"What a great place. Happy Hour is unbeatable with quality selections. Bartender Dave is a wealth of knowledge and solid guy. First time here won't be my last!!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  We always receive a coupon for The Standard in that pack of coupons that comes in the mail and we've been meaning to give the place a try. We came for happy hour recently and we were not disappointed! Most of their appetizers and salads are half off which was a great deal!  We had two delicious wedge salads, an order of Slovenian sausage, a roasted peppers dish and crispy arancini. Along with a beer and a drink, our bill was mass than $35. A fantastic deal for so much food!  The decor is very nice -- lots of exposed brick -- and the servers and hostess were all very nice. I hear there's a great patio out back that we'll have to try in the warmer weather. The only downside is there is just street parking but it's worth driving around a bit to give this spot a try."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly, the atmosphere was nice but the clientele is older. Why the 1 star? The food wasn't great. The spaghetti bolognese had too much pepper, the short rib stroganoff was a salt bomb. The highlight may be the fries followed by the mac and cheese which did not have much flavor but was loaded with bacon. If confused about their menu online, its the price of the small and large version of the dish."}
{"text":"There is something for everyone on the menu at The Standard. Any time we have out of town guests we put The Standard on our list to take them out for dinner. There are four guys in Russia wishing they can come back for another bowl of mussels. I have a couple favorite restaurants and this place is in my top 3. All the servers have a great attitude and the kitchen staff has hit it out of the park every time we've been here for lunch or dinner. The restaurant is always clean and the drinks are always full. I've tried so many dishes from the menu, I can say you will not be disappointed. The scallops are perfectly seared and the cauliflower is excellently roasted. Have a dirty martini and your night will be complete."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest place around, but you get what you pay for. The burger was just short of sexual and the macaroni and cheese was the stuff dreams are made of. If you're into the whole \"open kitchen\" thing they have one here. Great place for a date."}
{"text":"It's a bar with bar food. It laid back and friendly. Food is delicious and the drinks are cold. Prices are reasonable and the staff is always attentive. Worth a stop, if only for a Pint!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Monday with a group of 5 while traveling on business to Cleveland. The decor and food was fabulous.  It's great to see a really nice place on this side of Cleveland. Between the 5 of is we had the spatezel, beef stroganoff, salmon and pork tenderloin. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the service was just OK and they only had \"the pink packet\" as a sugar alternative to sweeten the  unsweetened tea."}
{"text":"What can I say... This place was amazing. Went with se friends on a Monday afternoon, which was by the way half off wine by the bottles, and let me tell you they have some hidden gems... We decided to sample some of the appetizers also half off for happy hour and they were to die for... Lamb meatballs and aracini was a gustatory adventure, shredded Brussels sprouts added some flair as well... Washed them all down with some Ridge Zinfandel.... Then for a main course we tried the Mac and cheese, spatezel and shrimp and grits... It was the perfect balance of texture and flavor

For dessert we got the apple bread pudding and iron horse sparkling which was a perfect end to a great dinner.... All of that and less than 100 dollars can't complain

Will definitely come back... The atmosphere and staff were top notch... Nothing Standard about it!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and service.  The chicken paprikash,  scallops and shaved brussel sprouts are my favorite dishes.  Fantastic cocktail and beer selection. Truly an exciting piece of a neighborhood trying to revive itself!"}
{"text":"Very inventive menu that the kitchen pulls off very well.  Basically a tapas restaurant with many small plate items from a spectacular cauliflower with raisins and capers dish to a lamb meatball app to a wonderful short rib stroganoff offering.  The beets are great (if you like beets).  Never sure what size any dish is and sometimes the service, while extremely nice, gets backed up a little.  A real gem on E. 185th in Euclid ... adventurous and very good!  Highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"This is a great little addition to the neighbourhood, a nice change from the chain coffee shops that surround it.  They serve coffee and pastries in a warm and inviting environment.  They also have some cool local handcrafted items like leather goods and jewelry for sale which is a fun touch.  I was debating between a chai latte and an espresso... The clever and friendly barista introduced me to the wonders of a dirty chai latte (chai latte with a shot of espresso, where have you been all my life?).  It was yummy, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Just walked into this extremely attractive coffee shop on Sherbrooke in Westmount to grab an iced latte.   It's upscale, prices are average. Extremely small selection of goodies to go with coffee so I didn't bother.   They have a patio outside with four tables which is really good because the seating inside is extremely small.   I'm not sure if I even bother coming here in the winter, I doubt there would be a seat available. Really pretty place, though."}
{"text":"Complementary valet out front. Make a reservation if you need a meal between 6-730 on normally busy nights. 

Most items are available as small plates or entree sized portions. Read some complaining some felt underdressed, felt not hipster enough or the prices were too high. As a middle aged man with a date I felt right at home. Nice place for a date. We spent $120 total with a bottle of nice wine And several glasses. 

Salumi and cheese board have nice selections. Worth it. The scallops and short rib stroganoff were well prepared and very good. Professional service from the bartenders."}
{"text":"This is the kind of meal that compels a return visit. Nice sized small plates, excellent drinks and friendly people. Brussels Sprout Bleu Cheese salad and Shrimp & Grits were excellent. No question we're coming back!"}
{"text":"Great little place; they made probably the best espresso I have ever had in Montreal. Tiny place though...seating is limited."}
{"text":"This visit was MUCH better than my last visit, which was a few years ago.  The Standard is close to home and I frequent quite a few of the independently owned restaurants in the neighborhood.  My first visit, was awkward and uncomfortable.  This visit was the complete opposite.  The atmosphere on a Friday evening was lively, and welcoming.  I met a friend for dinner, and I was not at all disappointed.  Our server, David, was great, he was knowledgeable, and friendly.  We arrived during Happy Hour and therefore took advantage of the $1 off cocktails and 1/2 price appetizers.  I ordered the grilled Halloumi and my friend ordered the crab cakes and brussel sprouts.  The crab cakes aren't included in Happy Hour, but were tasty, as was the grilled Halloumi, which was dressed nicely with mixed greens and pistachios...yum!   I ordered the small plate, short rib stroganoff and my friend ordered the large plate shrimp and grits, which she enjoyed. The stroganoff, was tasty.  The short rib was tender and well seasoned, the noodles were a bit overcooked, but the dish was still very good.  I'm glad that I gave this place, another try.  I will absolutely revisit!"}
{"text":"Allongé goûteux et à point quoique le latté glacé à 6$ (et quelques sous) est un peu overpriced mais tout de même délicieux. La déco est jolie par contre il manque un peu de place. Service adéquat mais sans plus."}
{"text":"Great find.  Cold beets and shrimp & grits fantastic.  Try the seared tuna
Friendly helpful staff.
A must see and re-visit"}
{"text":"Easy to find. Tidy little gem. Menu is somewhat limited. They dont do special requests. Over all worth the visit. Nice neighborhood spot with decent parking."}
{"text":"I won't ever go back. We went for my birthday. My idea; I invited my family to celebrate. We really like supporting the neighborhood, but I really walked away knowing that the restaurant didn't care that I chose them. We were seated at a high-top table next to the bar where a reunion was going on. It was very loud, so we asked if we could move. The hostess said that we could not since we did not request a lower table. She also stated that the reunion should be ending soon because they were only supposed to be there until 7, and it was now close to 8. Dinner was miserably long, and by the time we were offered dessert at 930, I audibly laughed and told our waitress that I wanted nothing more than to leave. It was an awful experience. You might want to check to see if there will be a crowd of middle-aged men loudly slurring memories laced with profanity at the bar before you go. Like I said, I won't go back. The food was good enough to warrant an additional star, but salt was needed on steak, chicken, and the fingerling potatoes."}
{"text":"Let's start biggest draw back is parking and neighborhood.   The ambience is nice with old fashion tin ceilings great decor.  The bar nice long with ample seating.  I love how they have wine selections. A couple per glass more by the bottle. They have nice selection of beer as well. I wanted the homemade  Slovenia sausage but was sold out. I got mussels and she got cheese.  Both were really yummy.  For dinner she got the chicken malinise. (Spelling it wrong ). I got the pork loin.  Both were really good.  Looking forward trying other dishes."}
{"text":"The Standard opened back in 2014 on the \"almost Euclid\" outskirts of Cleveland. I mention this only because it will help to put my comments into perspective. For you see, some of the missteps we experienced at this trendy little bistro/gastropub may have been forgiven was this a younger establishment. Unfortunately, it was this collection of missed little things that made for the difference between \"that was pretty good\" and \"can't wait to return\".

The interior is quite beautiful with its exposed bricks, tin ceiling panels, and vintage crystal light fixtures. A wooden archway with mirrored backdrop and a pair of televisions hold court over a marble-topped bar with seating for about a dozen or so and high top tables fill the rest of the space. More traditional dining lies around the corner in a darker, more intimate setting with a view into the open kitchen. A back door leads out to a very nice patio with another bar and umbrellaed tables. I thought the vibe was somewhere between hip and romantic with just the right mix of casual and upscale.

There is a noticeable demographic to the clientele here, too, and it's that they all appeared to be card carrying AARP members. Seriously, we're in our early 40s and we felt like kids among this group. Maybe that's who they're going after, I don't know. It could also explain their aversion to salt (more on this later).

If adult beverages are on your mind, you'll be happy at The Standard. The reverse of the menu is filled with about a dozen or so cocktail options for $10, a selection of wines by the glass and some bottled wines. My wife opted for the Matador, an expertly prepared citrusy rum drink that really packed a punch. They also have bottled beer and 12 beer taps with a nice selection of local beers mixed in. When I asked for a draught list I was given a small piece of notepad paper upon which the selections were hand-written. C'mon, people.

Service was very good and left no room for complaints. It's quite clear that this is a major area of focus for this place as nothing was left to chance. Waters filled, plates cleared, attentive servers checking in, the whole nine. If I had to pick one thing that The Standard does exceptionally well it would be this. You should also be prepared to eat way more bread than you should. The soft, crispy, warm, glutinous, deliciousness aka the bread that they serve here is ridiculously addictive.

For our meal we opted for the crispy arancini, shaved brussels sprouts salad, and small portions of the BBQ ribs and short rib stroganoff. Here's where the aforementioned \"little things\" come back to bite The Standard in its anthropomorphized ass. My wife really enjoyed her ribs, six bones atop a bed of sweetish Cole slaw and a pair of little corn breads. They were smoky, tender and delicious.

The remaining three dishes all suffered from problems with execution. The arancini were only lukewarm in the center and quite dry and crumbly. The accompanying marinara was tasty, though but the rice balls simply needed more cheese. The brussels sprout salad - which the menu fails to mention is warm, btw - was missing acid (a splash of balsamic, some dried cranberries maybe) and came off very oily. The short rib stroganoff, while a generous portion even for the \"small\" size, didn't have the taste or texture of short rib. I found it to be a bit chewy, stringy and fatty.

But the biggest single misstep with the food can be summed up in one word - seasoning. As in, lack thereof. None of our dishes had any hint of salt or pepper and seemed to capture the spirit of bland perfectly. I can't remember the last time I dashed so much salt on top of food at a restaurant. It just seemed like everything tasted flat. No punch.

Our experience was OK. The Standard has some potential, for this I must credit them. A concise, well thought out menu, talented bar staff, a comfortable well-designed space, and great service. Unfortunately, they've got some tightening up to do with their menu execution. Admittedly, we didn't try everything, but I think it's a safe bet that the problems are consistent."}
{"text":"Everything here was good from wine to apps to entrees. Definitely coming back next time I'm in town. Hidden gem."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and food. Tuesday night special 2 for $30 is amazing. Great drinks and good wine selection. Love the newly redone patio in the back."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday evening. Service was top notch and the food was incredible. We shared the crab cakes and a small salad to start. I had the macaroni and cheese with bacon and my husband had the burger. We shared a dessert. The atmosphere is nice. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've come here only for coffee so far. 
I've had many Americano & cortado. 
I came in during their first week on opening and was not disappointed. The barista encouraged feedback and critism of everything in the café. 

Only thing I noticed was that there wasn't a big selection of pastries (maybe that's changed)!

So far the best coffee within a walking distance from my place, so yay!"}
{"text":"This a good place for a Friday after work. We went during happy hour. The pints were great and the violet absinthe martini was strong.  We had the fries, arancini and lamb meatballs. I will be excited to visit the brewery that is opening next door."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of favorites. Chef is amazing. The hostess of many talents was superb!!  Looking forward to coming back ASAP!!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was empty. I can tell this place is hoppin' on other days, for how could it not with such a great menu and atmosphere? If only my Mom made brussel sprouts like The Standard does. Delicious. However, I wish the bacon and eggs were as tasty as it sounds, but the bacon was all fat and grizzle. The Grilled Pork Tenderloin was very good and the sweet potato was a good compliment.

I am really hoping this area of town revitalizes like the near West Side areas because it has SO MUCH potential!"}
{"text":"The standard was an all around great experience! I loved that when I walked in the environment felt especially warm. We were there to celebrate a friends engagement. The staff was quick and friendly! We started with the Brussel sprouts, they were delicious! For our main course most of the table ordered the steak and we all loved it! I'm new to the steak world so I'm still figuring out how to order my steak based on the cut. I ordered it medium, it was a little tough so next time I'll order it medium rare.I would go back here again in a minute!"}
{"text":"The spaghetti Bolognese is out of this world, as is the tuna & roasted cauliflower... their drinks are generous and delicious. I have not had a meal here that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and getting to watch the kitchen do their thing is just a bonus! The facilities are clean and well kept. Although, I can tell you for sure that if you're looking for a quiet romantic evening, you may need to specifically ask to be tucked in a corner-they can get quite busy and then every one has to talk over the kitchen doing their thing. Free valet is also a bonus!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is so pretty. Yes i have a soft spot for nice decor, minimalism & plants. The standard has everything that i like, love that its not too big it gives it a cozy vibe. They also had vegan milks options that's amazing, but it can be pretty pricy but totally worth the splurge"}
{"text":"I ordered the full sirloin and it was just okay. It was a special day and really hoped to get a nice steak but was disappointed.  However, the Brussels sprouts are tasty! I'd probably eat here again but I'm in no rush."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and I'm done.  Waited on my food forever both times(forgot to put the order in last time asked me what I ordered 20 minutes later).  The food was bland and overpriced.  My mac a cheese tasted like it came out of the microwave.  I had high hopes but disappointed."}
{"text":"Ambience: 4.5 outside seating is comfortable inside is cozy too...
Service: every time I've been here 4/5
Price: awesome they offer half portions on the entrees-that are definitely a meal plus ....it gives you the flexibility to try one of the great starter options - which, by the way all could be considered a main course.
Food: so this is where I get conflicted. I love, love, love  several of the main and starter courses. But I have come to rely on the consistency demonstrated in the shrimp and grits, chicken livers, Brussel sprout sautéed with walnuts and bacon, scallops, chicken malanese, the burger is never a let down...perfectly cooked and tastes great every time. But there are some items that consistently come up short. Granted-I am an east coaster. If you are an Ohio NE native these options are probably suitable BUT add some seasoning, use ReAL lump crab on each cake, add some seasoning to the broth and you will win me over. ...Overall the Standard is a go to choice for good drinks, great service and food that will satisfy your palette."}
{"text":"This is a nice little romantic restaurant.  Not very busy and the inside will surprise you if you judge it from the outside."}
{"text":"Excellent... I am originally from the area and remember what The Standard used to be... The space is transformed !  Excellent food, great service and a menu that has something for everyone!  Loved the music and all the company in there! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Quintessential gastropub with an eclectic menu full of tasty food and drink options.  The burger and brussel sprout salad are favorites and the music and atmosphere are always chill."}
{"text":"Too pricy for what you get in return. Ok food in small portions. I was pretty disappointed with my to-go order."}
{"text":"Live this little cafe on Sherbrooke and so happy about its location in NDG. The coffee is really good and so is the service. The ambiance is really comfortable and schiek. Great place for a latte and a good conversation."}
{"text":"Burger was dry as some cardboard never again brick burger coming up! Why though!? Just why?!"}
{"text":"I wanted to go someplace Special for a Special Meal & let me tell you, I was not disappointed at all.
The Standard was running a Special in Honor/ Remembrance of the late
Chef Paul Bocuse 
   Truffle Soup Elysees
Is a Rich Chicken Broth with pieces of light & dark chicken meat, shaved 
Black Truffles, sprinkled with Truffle Oil then topped with a Puffed Pastry Dome.
That Dome was a Perfect Golden Colour & had a nice high rise to it.
When presented it was Fabulous, the first puncture thru the pastry dome & all FABULOUS aromas that filled the room, Priceless.
Ä
   Entree was Roasted Duck Bigarade,
Tender Duck Breast, Crispy Skin, with
 2 red skin potatoe galettes
( thick, very well seasoned pancakes) with a Rich Brandy infused Blood Orange sauce with orange segments. 
   To Top this Feast off there was 

   CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY BOMBE
This is NOT FOR LIGHT WEIGHTS !!!
CALORIE COUNTERS !!!
CHOLESTEROL WORRIORS !!!
   A Mousse made with FRESH Raspberries & Real Eggs PLUS SECRET SPICES then a DOUBLE COATING of a Rich European Chocolate Grenache with White Chocolate & Whole Fresh Raspberries. 
The Service was good & attentive. 
   Chef Paul Bocuse would have been very proud to see how successfully one of his more popular menus was executed by Chef Marty Pond & His  Brigade."}
{"text":"I bought food there last week And got home to find two RAW hamburgers and burnt fries. Called them and they said come in another time and they would make it right. Went back only to get awful service and over cooked steak in some mystery sauce and nearly spoiled ribs and had a difficult time getting a refund from an awful staff. Will never return here again."}
{"text":"Always on point every time I stop in even though I'm usually the most underdressed person in the place."}
{"text":"We came in on a Tuesday night for a bite to eat and we decided to sit at the bar. The bartender came right over and got our drink order and promptly made them. After that we ordered some appetizers. We ordered the arancini which was delicious and we also got the chicken livers which was served atop some grits this was also delicious. From there we ordered our entrees which we decided to go with the smaller size for all three and they were the perfect size. We chose to do the ricotta spatzel which has duck confit in it, this dish just felt like it was missing something like a light glacé or even some olive oil. It was just a little on the dry side. We also ordered the scallops which were perfectly seated and were served on top of creamy risotto which was amazing. I loved this dish! Lastly we also had chicken paprikash which was perfect as well. The bartenders seemed to forget about as as no one came to ask us how the entrees were and we had to finally flag one of them down to get a box. On the way out of the restaurant the hostess was sitting on her phone and did not say bye or even look up from her phone which was a little surprising as you should always take a moment to thank guests for leaving. All in all we loved all the food except one dish and the service here could be improved but we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Very cute spot. I've been here before with my husband during the day time and it was really beautiful. Really like the fact that the kitchen is open until 11pm and it's close to home. I wasn't a fan of my shrimp and grits but being that I had not had anything to eat all day I did devour my food lol 

Will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"GOOD COFFEE!!! Their name aside, there's nothing standard about this place. It's a small local coffee destination ideal for anyone not looking for Starbucks or Second Cup. They have nice simple decor where people were sitting while on their computers and sipping their coffees. the staff was very friendly and I always love when I ask what can you make and the reply is \"we'll make whatever you want\".  They have a nice selection of small bites like mini-donuts, cookies and other fresh baked goods. It's a small location but still very cozy with a couple of tables outside. Definitely worth checking out if you like better coffee then the chains offer."}
{"text":"A truly hidden gem.  You could easily miss this truly amazing restaurant.  So glad we found this place.  
The food is good food - not deep fried all American junk food - really upmarket and genuinely flavorsome at a fraction of what you could expect to pay for such quality.
Salads were fresh (not wilted lettuce to be seen).  Dressing added to the experience but didn't drown the salad.  The lamb meatballs were the best (no grease left on my plate) and the tzatziki added the perfect finishing touch; a bit of a bite but not overpowering.
Added bonus: special of the day Seared Scallops, Wild Mushroom and Roasted Corn Flan, Champagne Beurre Blanc.  This dish was to die for.  
We sat outside on the patio which had plenty of shade but was a nice space. The music was perfect; not so loud you couldn't speak. It added to the atmosphere.  
Oops nearly forgot the amazing bread pudding with salted caramel icecream.  Yum yum yum! Good selection of wines by the glass, and beer (both on tap and bottled).  
We were there for a late lunch but wish we had been there for happy hour.  I can honestly say this is one of the best meals I have had anywhere in Cleveland.  
The icing on the cake was the amazing service by the lovely Olivia.  She was a delight; attentive but not overly so.  It was a perfect day.  I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant.  You have to try it!"}
{"text":"We were staying nearby and got in pretty late in the evening, so we wanted to eat somewhere that we could walk to. The Standard had good reviews, so we decided to give it a try. The ambience was fancier than we'd planned for with a marble-topped mahogany bar and candles at every table. Since it was a Monday night, the place was pretty quiet but there were a few couples hanging out at the bar (enjoying the Monday special of 1/2 price bottles of wine).

Most of the menu items have two prices - a small plate and an entree size. We just ordered the mac and cheese and the burger, which were fine, but nothing super special. Maybe the fancier menu items are where it's at, but I can't speak to that. The waitress was friendly and local, and it was nice to support a newer restaurant in an area that seems to be making a comeback, but if you're just looking for pub food, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is a great place for drinks. The bartenders take pride in knowing how to make a good drink and it shows. My fiancée didn't like the taste of a drink she ordered and the bartender listened to what the issue was and re-made the drink to her liking (which is not easy to do). The food however, leaves much to be desired. A trend we noticed rather quickly was the lack of flavor in most of the items. It was disappointing, especially given the mid-high prices. 

That being said: come here for drinks before dinner."}
{"text":"Husband and I visited on a whim after finding a coupon for a BOGO entree in the Val-Pak that comes in the mail. As we live on the East side of Cleveland, I was surprised we hadn't heard of this place. 

We made reservations for 7 pm on a Saturday night. Very glad we made reservations, or I'm not sure we would have gotten a table. The place was packed! We found on-street parking easily.

We were pleasantly greeted by the hostess and promptly seated at a high-top table. This ambiance of this place is great. Exposed brick walls, beautiful wooden bar, really cool metal ceiling, chandeliers emitting the perfect amount of light. Kind of felt like we stepped back into some swanky restaurant in the 20s. Really liked the look. The clientele was definitely older (didn't get the impression this was a new place were all the hip, young kids are visiting).  

We started with the arancini. I've never had arancini, so I have no comparison (these could have been good/bad/other). I thought they were delicious. The tomato sauce they were served with was particularly delicious and simple. The tomato flavor was the star (vs. seasoning). After we finished the arancini, I was wiped the remaining sauce up with the complimentary bread. My grandma always told me this was a compliment to the chef :)

For my main meal, I had the chicken paprikash (large portion), which was served with shaved brussels sprouts and spaetzel. The chicken was served on the bone with skin, and was very flavorful. The brussels sprouts brought a freshness to the dish, and the spaetzel were perfect little dough bites. The large portion had 3 large pieces of chicken. It seemed \"fancy\" and \"homestyle\" simultaneously. I easily could have sufficed with the smaller portion; however, our server neatly packaged my uneaten portion to go (and I'm pretty excited about the leftovers!). 
 
My husband had the sirloin (large portion). It was presented beautifully with whipped potatoes, wilted greens, and a Burgandy demi-glaze.  The sirloin was cooked to a perfect medium, and served sliced over the potatoes and greens. You can tell the sirloin had rested appropriately before it was cut; it was incredibly juicy. My husband DEVOURED this. I was able to sneak a bite, and I can understand why; it was absolutely delicious. IMO, this dish was a little more flavorful from the paprikash, which tasted more homestyle.  

We finished with the apple bread pudding, which is served with Mitchell's salted caramel ice cream. It was delicious. The consistency was perfect (not to mushy, not too crunchy), and the salted caramel ice cream was the perfect compliment. I loved the apples and plump, golden raisins throughout the dish. Would definitely order again. 

Our service was outstanding, and our server definitely sold us on a return trip, particularly for happy hour, when all starters are half-off. Although The Standard is not marked as a \"small plates\" restaurant, many of the dishes lend themselves to sharing. And because small portions of all entrees are offered, it makes it easy to try many different things on a single visit. 

I'm sure we'll return!"}
{"text":"We decided to try many things and every bite was better than the last! Arancini were outstanding! The Slovenian sausage was fresh and homemade. I'd highly recommend the spaetzel, short rib stroganoff, the chicken paprikash and the mussels. Our bartender Mick was extremely personable, new his stuff and you could he tell really loves working the bar. Great guy!  We'll be back, with friends, soon!"}
{"text":"I stopped by on a balmy Friday afternoon for some fall patio action and was blown away by The Standard. They advertise that they have \"the best happy hour in town,\" and they just might be right! The majority of their apps are half off. Half! And drinks are discounted, too.

I noshed on some marcona almonds  and fries while sipping on a seasonal libation - warm apple cider and bourbon. The patio itself was really nice, with an upscale backyard feel. I felt right at home and would definitely come back for more patio action or to try dining inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"A very neat coffee shop nestled in Westmount that comes with a really cool coffee machine. The seats are very comfortable, and the location is very good. Too bad there isn't more seating, but it's a small place. Coffee is top-notch."}
{"text":"I went to this place with a group of friends and I wasn't expecting much given the location, but wow this place really impressed me. It impressed me enough that I came back the following evening to try more food before writing this review. 

The chicken livers were amazing, the crabcakes great & full of crabmeat, the lamb meatballs were perfectly cooked, and the bread pudding is incredible! Even the brussels sprout dish was good and I don't like brussels sprouts. The beets were fresh and perfectly cooked, and a huge serving. I look forward to returning to try more of the dishes, nothing was disappointing. This place has a great chef.

Parking is easy here, there are usually spots open on East 185th and the street is very well lit. The interior was nice too but that's not why am returning -- I want more this food. 

Maybe I shouldn't write reviews when I'm hungry."}
{"text":"TLDR: Wonderful coffee, baked goods, and people.

The slick black decor creates a sophisticated yet inviting atmosphere. The baristas are well versed in coffee and can pull a mean espresso. In the summer, you can enjoy cold brew or a refreshing lemonade as well. Their pastries and doughnuts are also delicious. My friend and I split the chocolate hazelnut doughnut as well as a matcha one and were very happy with our selection. The Standard is the cafe you should go to if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The Standard is one of my favorite places in the Cleveland area. The food never ceases to amaze me. The Arancini is unbelievable as well as the shrimp and grits. The restaurant itself is awesome on the inside with a great old school bar look and the service has always been great. I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Cleveland area that loves great food. You will not be disappointed in a trip to the Standard."}
{"text":"I went for my brother's birthday dinner, party of roughly 20, and it was awesome!  

I had the crab cakes and shredded brussel sprouts.  The crab cakes are two small balls, slightly larger than golf balls.  There was a 60/50 ratio of cake to actual crab.  The redeeming portion of this appetizer was the sauce!  The sauce made this dish.  As for the shredded brussel sprouts, you have to try these!  Seriously, I think kids would willingly continue to eat these sprouts.

The dinner menu has split prices.  One for a small plate and one for a full size plate.  For this reason I decided to try the scallops and the short rib stroganoff.  Neither of these dishes disappointed.  There was something magical about the way they made the scallops.  The sear was perfect, without the sauce the scallops were wonderful.  I wasn't sure the short rib stroganoff would be able to follow this act, but it did so wonderfully!  The short ribs were extremely tender and full of flavor.  I only wish there were more noodles in this dish.  Everyone who had this dish had so much sauce left over and no noodles.

To finish I had the apple bread pudding.  This like everything else I has here was unbelievably delicious!  It's like a perfectly bake apple pie married bread pudding.   I would be remiss if I didn't mention I has the bartender make me a white sangria.  I have never had a sangria that hood at a wine bar.  I would absolutely drive 25 minutes to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after reading the reviews....have to say the chicken livers were great! Even if you don't like chicken livers, you'll fall in love with these! For the main course I had the scallops, again....worth every bite! Will definitely return. Great wine selection as well."}
{"text":"I'm not a big reviewer, but I was just really surprised by this place. Like the reviews say, the food is great! The place looks awesome and I love that more people are helping make the neighborhood a destination. 

My boyfriend and I went before a show at the Beachland. I'm not surprised we didn't get a table, but I couldn't believe the clientele! There were so many older snotty people! I'm not sure where they come from because they appeared to have money but poor taste. This place specializes in cocktails and they were repeatedly ordering things like margaritas, soco and lime and things with flavored vodka (which they carry none of). It was a complete mismatch! If you're up to speed with trends, even just a bit, you may notice it too. My recommendation is to get there early or make a reso because it becomes painful trying to sit at the bar with an affliction wearing 60 year old who won't take his elbow off your chair and scoffs at the bartender every time he orders a mixed drink."}
{"text":"First time checking out this new \"4th wave\" coffee spot in the neighbourhood and delighted with the cappuccino I ordered. The decor is sleek and elegant with smooth jazz playing in the background. Specialty coffee beans for sale, top notch equipment. These guys know their coffee. My only complaint would be the lack of space and poor seating arrangement, not the most comfortable. They could also benefit by stepping up their snack/pastry game. Otherwise, very happy to have discovered this place!"}
{"text":"Great food - great staff - I enjoy the atmosphere and ambiance!! It's very modern, classy and the soft lighting and cozy table placement is just right to enjoy a relaxing date night! 
Each entree is made special and placed on the plate with beautiful design.  The food is exquisite and the friendly faces that work there make the entire experience enjoyable:)
Great spot!"}
{"text":"The food was expensive, and I was charged a dollar more per menu item than was listed on the menu. The food wasn't great, definitely not worth the price but not bad. I'm gluten free and the server seemed knowledgeable and confident about which items were gluten free, so I ordered accordingly, and I got more gluten-sick than I've been in years, or maybe ever (I have celiac but I don't get super sick from small and exposures anymore, but I am definitely gluten sick right now)."}
{"text":"Don't miss the shredded Brussels sprouts with walnuts and blue cheese! Very cool look. Anxious to get back to try something else.  Scallops and beef stroganoff were great."}
{"text":"I went to the Standard during Happy Hour. The service was really good but the food, unfortunately was not good at all. The smoked salmon was overdone, and resembled a filet more than actual smoked salmon. The cheese we ordered as an app was rubbery and tasteless, it would have been a better experience possibly had we ordered other food. Definitely not worth the cost in any way."}
{"text":"I had the chicken paprikash with spaetzel and brussel sprouts.  The chicken was good and the paprikash gravy was nice. However everything else was dry. The spaetzle were in desperate need of some kind of fat, they were so dry. The brussel sprouts were also dry and tasteless. They needed some seasoning like salt and pepper.  Combine the dry spaetzel with the even drier brussel sprouts and it was like eating saw dust with pieces of wood. It just wasn't very pleasant.  The way these  brussel sprouts were prepared is why people hate eating brussel sprouts, almost one of the worst items i have ever eaten at a restaurant. 

Then the server forgot about us. When the hostess asked us if she could clear our tables I told her point blank we would like our check so we could leave.   We waited nearly 15 to 20 minutes after that conversation to receive our check. Then we got tired of waiting for the server to come back to pick up the bill. We just left the payment on the table and left. 

Simply put. I can make better at home, nothing special here."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Good menu and most entrees can be ordered in a small portion which is more than enough.  Excellent draft beer selection and wines by the glass.  My wife especially likes the beet salad and chicken livers. Pasta bolognese is also very good.  
Valet device on a freezing night is helpful and all this for a very reasonably priced evening.
Go, you will be happy."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day.  This was only their second year for brunch on this day. I feel that they could revise their menu selections (and edit the language !). But even after perusing the regular menu, I felt the same way. The food was good...I do not have much to complain about there...so for food, I give the place a 4. Even the drinks were good, but again, it came down to presentation. I asked about drink specials and they had none for this  holiday brunch.  Instead of giving me a regular drink menu, the server just said we have bloody Mary's and mimosas.

I feel I need to give this place a second chance on a regular day with regular menu items.  I would give 3.5 stars but Yelp won't let me and I do not feel it deserved a 4 today."}
{"text":"Outstanding. More than just a clever name, The Standard is truly setting the bar for the rest of the East side.  Having grown up in this neighborhood, it's great to see an establishment take pride in not only their craft, but their neighborhood as well. Cheers."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for happy hour, we got a bunch of half priced appetizers and half sized entrees. Free bread basket, nice crusty bread, soft on the inside. The lamb meatballs were kind of basic, not very flavorful. Slovenian sausage was very tasty, came with sweet pickles cabbage. Shredded brussel sprout salad was really good, it was warm, with bacon, blue cheese and walnuts. Very flavorful and delicious but also light. I got the sirloin, medium rare. The sauce was really good, the sirloin was a little charred but I like charred. Wilted greens were slightly bitter, whipped potatoes were very light and creamy. Good service and nice casual/classy atmosphere."}
{"text":"If only this restaurant served as the standard for all restaurants. My friends and I found ourselves here on a Monday after looking for a new happy hour to try. We decided to be a little adventurous and get out of the city, and this place is worth the drive. Half off bottles of wine on Mondays? Don't mind if we do. Half off small plates for happy hour? Don't mind if we do. And we may have gone out of control- but no complaints here. Everything was absolutely delicious. And the waitress was so friendly and helpful. I honestly can't think of a negative, maybe if it was just a little closer to downtown?"}
{"text":"I decided to try for the first time since moving to the East side and searching places to try and found it to be really good! Great cocktails for certain! The wait staff was amazing and very accommodating. The Brussel sprouts without a doubt delicious!! Parking was a little trying."}
{"text":"Just so you all know, the owners fired a staff member for standing up for what was right. Extremely bad ownership and you shouldn't support them. There are much more ethical, nice aesthetic, cafes you could be giving your money to."}
{"text":"I had such a nice relaxing amazing food. Great friendly service. Highly suggest going you will not be disappointed  !!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best café in Montreal (besides a small amount of places in Little Italy). I've been to Parvis, Myriade, Pikolo...The Standard is a tier above all of them. The interior design is incredible: all black, with fancy equipment and furniture. Standard brings in top notch food from the biggest shops in Montreal, namely Hof Kelsten, Trou de Beigne, St Viateur bagel, just to name a few. Definitely stop by here if you want to try the best."}
{"text":"Second time here and it is still great. We got the cheese board.  Mmmm.  Wife and I ate Brussels sprouts, chicken spratzel and Mac n cheese not in that order. All very good. 
The ambiance fits right into the neighbor hood.  You can tell the owners went to great detail on things. Example the long bar top is marble and so is the foot rest on the bar. Ceiling is cool to look at.  Menu has something for all. What a great place 185 street."}
{"text":"A for effort. B for the drinks. C for the the food. 

Drink - Happy Hour was from 3-6:30, and they offered a nice discount on drinks and appetizers/salads, although not all items under the 'snack' menu are discounted. There's a pretty good craft beer and wine selection. I had a glass of Malbec and Zinfandel, both were delicious and under $6 for large pours, so 5 stars there. 

Food - I ordered the beet salad and a small portion of scallops and risotto. The beet salad was good, but I didn't like how it was presented and wish the beets were sliced. The scallops were OK, kinda undercooked and the risotto was watery, less creamy than I'm used to. I liked the flavors though, but end result wasn't that yummy. My dad got the crab cakes - he thought they were good, but the portion is very small and they are not discounted for happy hour.

Bar/Restaurant/Service - We sat at the high tables in the bar area - very comfy, cozy and provided plenty of seats. Waitress was friendly - she handled most of restaurant and provided quick and friendly service. 

Overall, I liked this place and am giving them credit for elevating the restaurant/bar options along 185th, just wish the food was better and truly worth the higher price point. I'm willing to pay, but it needs to be really good. I will probably be back to try something else next time I'm in town, hopefully when it's warmer and we can sit outside- they have an outdoor area in the back."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  The sirloin very good, done just right.  Roasted cauliflower appetizer was very tasty.  Will definitely return.  Thank you Mackenzie."}
{"text":"I'm really excited about a third-wave coffee spot in NDG/Westmount, and it's exactly what I hoped for: Parallel 49 beans, Pacific-brand almond milk, strong coffee-to-milk ratio, friendly service. Pastry game seems average... They had a few options but nothing that screamed \"fresh, local, seasonal\" (like a rhubarb square! Cherry parfait! Peach muffin! It's August!)

My barista seemed to be the owner, and he was nice enough, but not super outgoing. 

If he were to ask my advice (and let's pretend he did, cause I'm gonna give it regardless), I would tell him that he should put some friendly, chatty folks behind the counter, put labels on the pastries and get some pies from La Rustique or somewhere very \"Montreal\", and maybe put out some fresh flowers. Step it up! We want to like you more than the other guy, but we need you to want us to want you. You feel me?"}
{"text":"I came here with someone special and was very impressed. They know how to make a great cocktail and the atmosphere is beautiful. I felt like nothing existed but the two of us. The Brussels sprouts are out of this world and I will get them every time I come here. I hope Cleveland fixes the road soon because you run the risk of damaging your car getting here if you aren't careful but if you're good at dodging holes, it's well worth it. This place is a gem on E. 185 St!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place for the first time the other day and after seeing the food porn on Yelp had to go try it basically right away. 

I was apparently in the minority of those who had never heard about The Standard before, because the place was very busy. We didn't have to wait for a seat at 7:30p on a Friday, but by the time we left every seat in the bar and dining room was filled; some by large groups. Half a dozen chairs at a counter looking into the kitchen were also taken. 

A lot of the entrees come in half and full sizes. The pork tenderloin that I ordered for example came in a 4 and 9 ounce portion. I got the small portion. The pork came sat on a savory bread pudding and both were sprinkled with blueberries and drizzled in a liquid blueberry jam. The pork was lean and cooked perfectly; all of it was edible. The jam was good too, but the bread pudding stole the show. I've never had a non-dessert bread pudding, but this was delicious. There were pieces of meat in it and herb seasoning. It had the texture of the dessert style bread pudding, but was an excellent side for the entree. 

The rest of the menu looked delicious and the salad portions looked large. I would definitely add this place to my list of places to try again. 

The server was great. Friendly and attentive and hit all the points of service you would expect from a higher end restaurant. 

Valet or street parking."}
{"text":"Pretentious place with no summertime air conditioning, limited seating and not very good espresso. Maybe I just don't \"get\" it, but it seemed like much ado about nothing."}
{"text":"Despite the general decline or perceived decline of Euclid, there are many fine places that still exist or are being created.  The standard is a refreshing and warm place.  The feel is neighborhood at its finest. You are treated like a family friend. The selection of drink and food is excellent! Here at happy hour and it gave meaning to the monicker.  Olivia will take good care of you. She has been one of the sweetest and kind servers I have ever had! She did treat us like old friends ! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"What a great place we found and we don't live anywhere near it! But we will go out of our way for the food! Only had the small plates during their great happy hour,  perfect size for a couple.  Brussel sprouts are simply the best,  shredded  with walnuts,  delicious.  Many other great menu items as well.  Nice wine selection and friendly staff,  we'll keep coming anytime we find ourselves out East!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar, friendly service. They have a seating area that looks into the kitchen if you want to watch the chefs cook.  We ordered the meat/cheese plate, the beet salad and spaetzle. Everything was tasty."}
{"text":"We had our department holiday party here and they handled our group of 27 people with efficiency and class. We were seated in the side room, next to the uniquely placed kitchen toward the front of the restaurant.

When you walk in, it's warm & inviting- a faux (real?) panel drop ceiling, elegant crystal light fixtures and warm dark wood throughout. Perfect place for a date night or drinks with the girls.

We started with several of the Salumi and cheese boards. Each had a nice variety of salty, fatty & sweet morsels. The grilled bread was a perfect pair. Only wish they'd listed what each item was on something so you'd know for future reference. And those Marcona almonds? Drool! I almost wanted to hoard the whole thing for myself and not share. 

I selected the Chicken Milanese as my entree. The chicken was fresh and juicy, and the salad was filled with crisp greens and perfectly dressed and topped with generous a shaving of Parmesan. 

Finished the meal with a delicious cup of coffee and the flaky  chocolate almond strudel. They must be hiding a saucy German granny so where in that kitchen who makes pastries as I haven't had one like this since my last visit to the country. Definitely homemade! 

I look forward to going back to try something else soon!"}
{"text":"I like the decoration, i feel good inside, i really like the chai latté. Big windows and the air conditionair is reparing .. About the coffee i have no idea i dont drink coffee lol. But they have a limonade in summers and about the price we have to ask for each items .. they dont have menu with prices.. but its almost 5$ each drink.."}
{"text":"Only had drinks here, but the atmosphere & owner were great! Wine selection is good and my husband had 12 Dogs Christmas Ale. Cozy, well-lit, but not too bright & valet parking. Bartenders were friendly & kind. Met the owner, Chris, who chatted with us for about 15 minutes & ended up buying us a round of drinks. Really like this place & we will be back to try the food."}
{"text":"These guys love their espresso, and it really shows! Fantastic equipment, fantastic people, and a fantastic result!

The interior design of the cafe is beautiful and, combined with all of the delicious pastries, I could see spending some quality hours in this place.

If what you're looking for is espresso-snob-proof cappuccino and to momentarily quell your sweet tooth, this is your place!"}
