{"text":"Attached to the delta hotel this is a very reasonably priced spot with very good food. Drink selection is excellent. Great spot before a hockey or baseball game.  If you have a choice of waiters ask for Nathan. He will take good care of you."}
{"text":"Our mains were reasonably good; confit of duck was tasty, mushroom soup was lovely, cheese plate was well presented and the chopped salad was pretty, if not a little bland. Good mixed drinks - inventive and palatable. Desserts were a disappointment - the \"fresh baked warm cookie\" was in fact, cold and remarkably similar to something we'd pull out of a grocery store box. The \"Turkish rice pudding\" appeared to be Turkish by virtue of the weird addition of two rolled baklava portions, speared and lying helpless on a somewhat uninspired, cold rice pudding.  Apparently the salted caramel ice cream was good, though..... Given the cost, I felt the meal could've been taken to a higher level, but fell just a little short."}
{"text":"Busy but lacking character. Our server had little to say. Not much personality. The bartender was the same. He rarely engaged us. It was later in the night, perhaps they wanted to go home. Food followed suit, it just wasn't fantastic. For such a large and valuable location it just didn't offer much for me."}
{"text":"Being from the west coast, I love fish, especially all sorts of wild pacific salmon, so when I read on the menu that SoCo has pacific spring salmon, I was excited to order it with my salad.  The salad itself was very tasty.  However, the Pacific spring salmon they advertised was actually just regular Atlantic salmon, bland and tasteless.  It really makes me wonder what they feed to raise these farmed Atlantic salmon to make them taste so terrible.  Very disappointing.  Peanut butter cream puffs - average puff pastry filled with peanut butter. It came with a cheap pot of Nutella and a scoop of mediocre tasting ice cream.  Sticky toffee pudding - pretty tasty but very sweet.  Fries - tasted almost exactly like McDonald's fries, just way saltier."}
{"text":"This is brand new restaurant in the new Delta Toronto (Bremner and Simcoe)- I went twice last week and plan to go again next week - close to my office. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I have only been to lunch but had some overall good experiences.  First experience was 3rd day of opening.   Service was casual, lack and not impressive but food came fast and was very good. I had the roasted chicken which was a decent size and had some nice sides.  My lunch companion had lobster fettucini, it was not large portion but he said it was excellent. The next time I went had the burger- FABULOUS.  And the service was much, much better (different server) Prices were similar to sit down nicer restaurants in the area, some items might even be better priced.   The 2nd server we had asked if we wanted separate bills for 5 of us, a nice touch rather than trying to do some math.  For that lunch we were in and out in 45mins.   Looking forward to going back again, would recommend and just let people know know the service may be hit or miss until the knicks get worked out."}
{"text":"My friends and I live in the area and decided to try this restaurant for convenience's sake and first-time curiosity. It was an all right experience. Service and food is good, a bit overpriced for the quality and portion. Our server was attentive and patio was a nice atmosphere. I would come back maybe for the patio or on a weekday night."}
{"text":"Attached to the delta.  Had the seafood pasta with mussels and it was amazing.  Service and staff were great."}
{"text":"Good food(both taste and presentation), service, location! No much to complain...maybe a bit pricy considering the amount given, and cannot turn on the volume for games - not a sports bar anyway :-)"}
{"text":"Cyprianos was a great time. Very friendly and attentive. Made our business lunch into a party! We all enjoyed our meals. The lamb keftas and sopprasatta flatbread were unreal. Menu fit all tastebuds! The restaurant also accepts apply pay."}
{"text":"Staying at the Delta for a convention next door at the MTCC, I decided to treat myself to a proper sit down lunch rather than eat at some of the very average quick food places nearby. I read a good review on Yelp for the burger at SOCO and decided to give it a shot. I ordered a medium rare burger and an unsweetened iced tea. The waiter, Tanner, actually went through the trouble of brewing hot tea to pour over ice, as the restaurant only had sweetened iced tea.  The burger was great, properly seasoned, cooked spot on, yet still well seared on the outside. The brioche bun, while light, held together to the end. I was wary of the onion bacon jam, but it had more bacon than expected and suited the burger. The french fries were good also -fresh cut shoestring and came with a truffle aioli mayo for dipping.  It's not cheap at $19, but after a recent stint in Vegas finding two different upscale burgers meh, this was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"Soco is affiliated with the Delta hotel, right next to the convention center.  The food here is actually very good.  They have a modern menu with a nice variety of starter and main entrees.  Sea bass was excellent and perfectly cooked.  Duck confit is also very good.  If you're in the mood for dessert, try the peanut butter cream puffs.  They admittedly sound underwhelming, but are surprisingly tasty!  The service here is top notch with very helpful advice if you cannot decide what to order.  Pricey menu, though perhaps not surprising for a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"What's up yelps it's hot boy Nav from RX. I'm live and direct from my office writing this review cause you all know I hustle so I get money regardless. Some of your guys maybe thinking is this guy on drugs when he's writing his review because he sure sounds like it and doesn't make sense. Well rest assure everybody I live a drug free lifestyle despite the fact I live in the hood.  Anyways on the this place called soco, it's connected to the delta hotel which is kinda cool... On second thought I guess nothing really cool about that. We sat outside on the patio and it gives off a corporate restaurant vibe. But nothing wrong with that everybody was nice and polite the waiters were nice except in the beginning our waiter looked like he's coming down from an LSD trip. Looked like he hadn't slept in a couple weeks. I always say if your gonna do drugs take the day off and make sure it's outta your system before your in for work, and if you forget and can't avoid it drink lots of redbull and hope you don't get drug tested at work. Shout out to redbull for always keeping me hooked up with wings.   I ordered the crispy duck confit, this dish was really good I would say it was a 5/5 prob best dish on their menu. I also ordered the lamb sausage in a bun. I asked the waiter if it was gamey and he said it wasn't and it was my other friend liked it so I gave it to him and he said he would give it a 4/5. If that last rating is not accurate I can give you my friends email and you can complain to him.   I also ordered the Mac and cheese, pretty basic not much going on over here prob wouldn't recommend it for you guys 3/5. I then got the 5 puff balls with peanut filling and Carmel drizzle sauce. Just drooled all over my iPhone...hope AppleCare doesn't read about this when I bring it in for water damage...the desert was good I'm going to give it a 5/5 as well the Carmel sauce was very nice and the puff balls were a nice light dessert to end off the meal. Overall I had a good time.  ***please note that if sitting on the patio wear a neck brace and creeper shades cause there's a ton of good looking girls out there****   I'm out of money now so back on that corner. Gotta charge up"}
{"text":"Went for summerlicious menu, with beets salad as an appetizer, duck confit for main, and dark chocolate desert. Salad was great, with buratta chess melting in your mouth. Duck confit was amazing, one of the best I have had in toronto, and desert to top it all off! Wouldn't expect much based on reviews, but the meal was really amazing, and at 35$ a great value!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 based on the location and price point. This is a much better option that Hoops, Aria or Eleven (unless you are willing to spend a lot of $$). I recommend the PROSCIUTTO pizza and CHARCUTERIE board to share. The GRILLED ROMAINE was fantastic but its definitely overpriced for what you get! This is a great place to go for wine & cheese as well before a night out."}
{"text":"Low quality food and service. Over priced. Never going back again although across the street from where I live. On a bill of $100+ for a couple, being charged for bread basket for $4 ! lol"}
{"text":"Food standards must be pretty high in Toronto, because this would easily be rated a whole star higher in Los Angeles. It might not be the sleekest restaurant, but you not leave unsatisfied. Mezze appetizer comes with hot, grilled pita and duck confit enter was delicious. Crispy on top and carnitas-like center. Squash and grains salad was also excellent and fairly priced."}
{"text":"What a fantastic gem!  Delicious food with unique and eclectic menu options to satisfy every foodie. The service was great and the server was very informative, which is essential for any food experience.  Came here to celebrate with family and have to say we were not disappointed. From the cheese boards, to duck, beautifully crafted burger and rich mac n' cheese... We all left satisfied and will definitely come back to the city for another go.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Not a huge menu but a lot of cool items.  Went in looking for some light bites and a few drinks at an outside table.  Ended up to be a perfect choice.  Good food and staff.  The music and people watching were a nice compliment to our visit."}
{"text":"Everything I've ordered has been hot, fresh and amazing. You have to try the poke. The serving is a good size and flavourful."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! We are visiting Toronto from the US and thoroughly enjoyed our white sangria, Margherita pizza, and the green salad. We are from Orange County and wish there were restaurants as reasonably priced as this one in our area with such amazing food."}
{"text":"As a native Torontoian, I have come accustomed to great food. It is for this reason, I am writing this review. Those travels experiencing this city through a fresh or familiar lens, head this advise: STAY AWAY!!!!  Aside from a spectacular patio, this restaurant boasts 2/10 service with the culinary imagination of a 14 year old stocked with a fridge of Ultra Mart specials. Should you ever find yourself accidentally people watching from there patio waiting for your overpriced pitcher of watered beer, get the fries-apparently they understand deep frying.  Please, steer clear and discover a true gem of culinary Toronto. This restaurant is at best, an overpriced, underwhelming hotel kitchen (just read the name!!!)."}
{"text":"7 mins wait until I acknowledged a manager that coincidentally stood at my booth, I requested for the server no name given, who then showed up 3 mins later. As my appetizer, I got grilled lamb speducci and Mezze(hummus -pita -spiced eggplant olives), taste was very well put together, puta had hint of butter, hummus hint of citrus and pepper, eggplant tangy garlic. Pictures are included food is awesome however kindly fix service attention towards clients. Seating and forgetting equals bad reviews kills the food attention. Because people become H-angry hungry and angry."}
{"text":"Arrived in Toronto for the annual Caribana Festival and it was late and we were really hungry but too tired to really go too far from our hotel, so we went to the restaurant right downstairs. The service was horrible!! We waited over 15 mins before we had to flag down our server, she gave us lukewarm waters to drink and once she placed our orders and received them, she never came back to check on us. The hot wings were super salty and she never asked me how I wanted my burger cooked. Totally awful experience!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday, and the lobster tagliatelle is so delicious, a must order !! Price wise is a bit on the expensive side. The forbidden fruit is a mixed drink, there were a lot of ice cubes inside that made the drink pretty diluted ever. The kahluha tiramisu dessert is also very yummy. I really enjoyed my lunch eating here. Definitely coming back here on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Went here after visiting the aquarium and so happy NO kids in sight.  Great waitstaff.  I had the roasted corn and jalapeño chowder, just lovely.  Stone bowls and nice, sturdy silverware is a nice touch.  Main course was crispy duck confit with some vegetable I cannot pronounce with few roast peach slices that paired lovely with the duck. Great place for drinks and meeting up after work or before events.  After dinner coffee was lovely.  Bit pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"I loved this place. My friend and I visited this place at night for late night snacks. We ordered flatbread, meatball, and mac and cheese. Everything was so good! The food were warm and just... tasty! The flatbread had fresh tomato, cheese and basil, and especially tomato was juicy. The menu said their mac and cheese won some kind of championship and we could agree that it was very good. Just thinking about it makes me drool. Haha. We really liked meatballs too.  The staffs were very kind and helping. The atmosphere was perfect for our night out. Not too dark, not too bright. It was casual but still had sophisticated feeling. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food here was ok but they are unbelievably slow.  Went for lunch with work colleagues, seated at 12:30, orders taken at 12:40, no food until 1:45.  This is just crazy for a place that is right beside a couple of office towers and has to expect some business from people with jobs to get back to.  They will probably make it on business from the hotel and pre-sports event consumer desperation, but avoid if you can (unless you have 2 of more hours for lunch, I guess)."}
{"text":"Stopped here while traveling, and it was great! Service is terrific, and the prices are reasonable.Everything was good, but the Tuna Appetizer (Poke?) was the most delicious raw tuna dish we've ever had!"}
{"text":"Before heading to the ACC, we decided to give this place a try because I had really wanted to try their mac and cheese-- and boy did it not disappoint!  Located minutes away from ACC, the restaurant was spacious and very open. It is located in the Delta Hotel.   Now first thing I wanted to get was the mac and cheese, there are two different sizes in which I had asked the waiter how big the \"mini\" was. His hand gesture led me to believe it was quite tiny which was fine because that would have been my side. To my delight, the size was bigger than expected. The crispy crumbs was the perfect way to top off the dish. The cheesiness was delicious, nothing overpowering and no \"artificial\" taste that tends to happen with restaurant style mac and cheese.  Now my main dish was the mozzarella and feta stuffed crust pide. The moroccan lamb ragu was very flavourful, heavy notes of one of my fave arab dishes. The amount of mozzarella in the crust was stretchy which I loved-- I hate when the mozzarella gets too structured in the crust.  Overall-- I would recommend coming here especially how close it is to ACC."}
{"text":"ughh...service is so slow...and we were the only ones sitting at the patio!  Nice venue but over priced and a bit pretentious."}
{"text":"Tried the fig flatbread (pizza). It was really interesting with the fig, cheese, and arugula fusing together. It was pretty big, had about 8 slices - you can finish it if you're really hungry or take the rest home (although I don't recommend it as there is some balsamic vinegar that makes the flatbread soggy if left uneaten for a long time).   Would have given 3 stars but the service was absolutely terrible. There is a mandatory gratuity for groups over 8 people. It felt like the servers didn't really care as their tips were \"set in place\" - they were fast in delivering the food but it took forever to flag a server down to pay/ refill waters, etc. Potential to go back again but definitely within a smaller group setting."}
{"text":"We waited for a table while the hostess very rudely spoke on the phone for ten minutes and all the other staff walked by pretending we were not there. Once we were finally seated we were told we had to hurry up and order quickly as the lunch menu ended at two.  We then sat for ten minutes watching the waiters stand around talking amongst themselves.  We never received drinks and weren't approached to order.  We walked out. We were given dirty looks by the staff as we left and weren't even asked why we did. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"I ordered the bouillabaisse on a recommendation from the server.  It was one of the pricier dishes, but I went for it. The taste was good, not great. The quantity of food was minimal for the price. Two shrimp (not prawns as indicated on the menu), 2 clams, 2 mussels, and a very small pice of fish with 3 pieces of grilled vegetables and just enough liquid coat the bottom of the bowl.  Perhaps this was more about the presentation than the food, or perhaps I was just a little too hungry after my flight in.  Either way, it was less than what I expected and I left hungry. I also observed the chef plating my meal and struggling to pry open the shellfish to present in the bowl. Any knowledgeable seafood eater knows that if the shells don't open during the cooking process, you shouldn't eat them."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing, I really loved this place. The decor was nothing out of this world, but the service was great, with attentive and warm staff, and the food was INCREDIBLE. Don't dare leaving this place without trying their Mac and cheese because it is the best you will try in your life. Also: great options for brunch. Do ask for a dessert, they are all great!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and for dinner as we stayed at the Delta. Overall, a mediocre experience. Their breakfast buffet is well done, with a lot of variety of food to choose from. They had scrambled eggs, sausage, cured meats and cheese, pastries, pancakes, bagels, etc. Their buttermilk pancakes are to die for! We were excited to try the crisp duck confit for dinner but it fell short of expectations. Ended up eating most of the rib and wings dishes instead."}
{"text":"Disclouser I was a hotel guest that gets free breakfast at Marriott hotels due to my status:  Looking over the breakfast menu and seeing what the prices they charged it seemed inline with any major city center restaurant. The food quality was good, I was there 5 nights so too many items to list."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Delta Toronto and ordered room service from SOCO Kitchen + Bar for convenience. I had the SOCO burger with the SOCO greens salad and it was delicious. Burger was cooked perfectly, nice and juicy and flavourful. The salad had a great combination of ingredients and the dressing brought them all together. If I stay again in the future I would probably order from here again."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and they have very friendly staff. A great spot to go to before going to a jays, raptors or leafs game."}
{"text":"Busy downtown business area that has a small menu with good portion sizes. It also happens to be on the way to the ballpark if you're travelling from union station.   I've been here twice and both visits have been good experiences. Service was good and the food was tasty.  Fries were a little over salted at times.  Staff know their menu very well and it show with their ability to answer questions about menu items in the fly.  Prices are a little high if your not a downtown diner but fitting considering its location."}
{"text":"Brieann (SP?) and Maddie (SP?) were amazing hostesses and the food was outstanding! Couldn't stop eating the Mac and Cheese! We tried to put them out of business! As guests of the hotel, we ate there daily for three days straight. Great bar atmosphere and very welcoming employees. The breakfast buffet was top-notch as well. Hopefully get back at some point! Thanks, Soco!"}
{"text":"The location was great and service was good. I was a bit disappointed by the food. The mac and cheese was great but the lobster tagliatelle was just ok. What I was most disappointed by was the ambiance inside. I had checked online and saw they had a rooftop patio. I was excited to go to the rooftop only to learn it was closed for the season. They do have a street level patio as well but the ambiance isn't the same, so we chose to sit inside not knowing what it was like. It was not an enticing atmosphere inside. The booths looked kind of cheap and it just lacked overall interest typical of a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"The Roof by Soco was really nice. It's a big space with plenty of seating. The view is insane and so close to the CN Tower. They also have games on the side which make it fun to grab a drink and play around."}
{"text":"The ambience and service here are nice. I sat on the patio and it was nice. I only got appetizers and a cider. The cider was run of the mill, strongbow, with a few other run of the mill options available. For appetizers I got the veal meatballs and the chorizo croquettes. Both were fairly mediocre, especially for the price."}
{"text":"FIG FLATBREAD  --crisp oven-fired crust --very satisfying combination of braised onions, mission figs, prosciutto, arugula, vinaigrette LOFTY SPACE --clean design, not too hipster-noisy"}
{"text":"The location of this place is the biggest plus point. I ordererd salmon as the main plate and it tasted really good. However, not an ideal place for large groups. They dont split bills is the worst part and staff was not at all friendly in accomodating group in one common area."}
{"text":"Soco Kitchen and Bar is located in the Delta Toronto hotel.  Since we stayed there, and didn't want to order room service, we decided to come here and try out breakfast before our tour at CN Tower.  They do have a buffet if you want to take that route.  However, please note that the buffet is only open until 9am.  It's more for the business crowd, I guess, because the Financial District is just down the street.  And, It's $23 ($18 USD) for the weekends and $29 ($22 USD) on weekdays, thus proving my point even more.  If you don't want the buffet, you can also just order from the menu, which we did.  My wife and kids had the standard breakfast fare and I had a dish called Shakshuka (with potatoes).  It is a Middle Eastern dish with Sausage, poached eggs, and a delicious ragu.  While I wish there was more ragu, the dish itself was fantastic!  A definite must order if I see it at another restaurant (since I probably won't be in the area again for awhile).  If you just want some quick food to go, you can also walk to the back of the restaurant and to the left.  They have a Soco To-Go section in where you can grab a quick lunch, dinner, or snack."}
{"text":"Was in the area for a concert and needed a quick bite, so stopped by here.  Was seated really quickly and got our orders in very fast. Ordered the Orecchiette and my friend got the Mac and Cheese. Both were very good and a good size portion. Was very nice comfort good. We both got the Cider they had as well, and it was quite good.  The service was really good overall, as we told them we were in a bit of a hurry and they made sure everything came out really fast. All were friendly and moved quite quickly.  Overall a nice place to stop by in the area if you're looking for a quick bite of comfort food!"}
{"text":"This restaurant did not meet my expectations. Bad service, good food, overpriced espresso. It was my sister's 16th birthday and we spent the day at the aquarium, then headed here for a nice birthday dinner. Upon arrival, we noticed that the restaurant was nearly empty, 6:30 on a Monday night. So when our hostess went to seat us, I asked if we could sit by the widow instead of at a booth. (My sister has lived in rural areas her whole life, so the CN tower is very special) All of the table seats were empty, but I asked nicely because maybe they had 12 reservations for 7 at the window seats, who knows? Well... That did not go over well, the hostess gave us a lot of attitude and then gruffly sat us at a window table, not even wishing us a good meal or any parting words. RUDE. This made my sweetheart sister feel so terribly, it was on her mind the whole rest of the meal. A while later, the hostess walked by and my sister smiled at her, and got no smile back. Totally unprofessional.  Our waitress was pleasant, but awkward. I asked for her advice between 2 dishes and she just recommended the option that costs more, no explanation or preferences. Whatever, we still tipped 15% but I'm not sure what for...  We had the filet mignon (special) and lamb chops, it was good, not great. Overpriced for the portion sizes. I had an espresso to finish and it was $4 plus tax..  Overall, disappointing experience for my sister's special birthday. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Food was good. Recommend the pancakes on the brunch menu. Burgers are good too. The service was very lacking was seated for a long time without anyone coming over. I finally had to wave someone down. When our server did finally show up she was not friendly at all. She didn't seem to like working there or even care. So that was disappointing. It felt as if everyone was doing us a favor by serving us."}
{"text":"I randomly decided to try this place before attending a jays game. I was surprised their patio wasn't full and after trying the food I could tell why. I ordered the kale and romaine salad, lobster tagliatelle and my husband ordered the black cod. All the dishes were presented beautifully and looked delicious, but were all bland. The salad didn't have much flavour and the charred edges tasted as though it were smeared in cigarette ashes. It was so off putting I stopped eating it. The lobster tagliatelle tasted like it was covered in a  massively watered down garlic oil and I only ate it because I was hungry. My husband's black cod tasted as though it was on the verge of going bad. I absolutely love black cod, but I hated this dish. I couldn't eat more than one bite. The service was friendly, but I would not recommend this place to anyone. I was hoping to eat a great meal before the game, but I would have rather eaten a street dog."}
{"text":"Two stars cause the food was good - we got the veggie burger with side salads and the bacon burger with fries. The side salads were unique and I recommend it. The French fries were crispy and salty, just the way I like them - sooo addicting.  The veggie burger was also really yummy! I asked them to hold the pineapple and cheese, which they got wrong twice. Also, zero logic used as if I'm telling you I can't eat dairy and to hold the cheese, a good server would use his brain and tell me that the dressing for the salad has dairy but nope, our server just didn't give a f about any of that.   The two stars is generous as our server was literally nonexistent. In an almost empty restaurant, it took him ten minutes to even bring water and take our order. He then stood at the side table (where we could see him) and didn't come back to us until the very end of the meal where he quickly apologized for the confusion with messing up my order twice...  To the owners of the restaurant, your server's lack of attention and complete disregard for customer service is going to ruin you."}
{"text":"Very trendy place and its part of the delta hotel. Spacious and very convenient. The restaurant is near the hockey stadium, aquarium, cn tower and the baseball stadium. We went there on a weekend and the food was ok. Pricey. Service was great and they have very friendly staff. The ribs are     Taste like normal bbq ribs and the side of mac and cheese was pretty small. My husband thought the fish dish was good."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Delta Hotel in Toronto for the Killers Concert at the Air Canada centre and after arriving early afternoon and hanging out in the hotel room for the afternoon we suddenly realized that we were super hungry. Wanting Dinner and not wanting to go outside ( -25F Windchill ) we picked the Soco Kitchen and Bar in the lobby of the hotel just after it opened around 5pm. Very cool vibe and we were seated promptly by our server. We ordered the Soco fries to share and they were yummy, then we each ordered one of their Signature Pizza's and were equally impressed at the quality. overall bill with Wine worked out to be just over $100 CAD which really wasn't too bad. Recommended."}
{"text":"We stopped here while on vacation.  Service was great and food was even better.  They are kid friendly too which is a plus."}
{"text":"No complaints! A party of 7 and we're all satisfied. Everything was either good or great! Our server was quick and attentive with exceptional service. Was my first time here but it won't be my last. The vibe is young fresh and chic.   Gotta say, server made the experience a five star review. Thanks Virgil, hope to get you next time as well."}
{"text":"Stellar service and great food made this an all round excellent dining experience.   A came here with a girlfriend who was visiting from the east coast. We decided to split an appetizer, the calamari - sooo good! It was grilled to perfection. We both enjoyed it.   For entrees, we wanted to share so I ordered to the duck confit (at the recommendation of our server, Evan) and she ordered the bouillabaisse. We were both huge fans of the duck! I'm not typically a duck fan so that was a great surprise. The skin was crunchy and the meat very moist, not fatty at all. The bouillabaisse was our least fav dish. While the Arctic char was prepared beautifully and the other seafood cooked nicely, the sauce left nothing to be desired. It felt like it was missing a kick so to speak.   All and all though, it was a terrific dining experience. I would go back for sure. I highly recommend you try the calamari and/or duck. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We showed up a few minutes before service was starting and they made a big deal of telling us that we couldn't order until exactly 11:30pm. It wasn't a big deal but they made me feel kindof uncomfortable.   The food was good. The service was okay. A bit overpriced for the experience."}
{"text":"This place has a great ambience and great food. I had the crisp duck confit and my husband had the beef burger. Both cooked to perfection, flavorful and was presented well. I also had the oysters which were fresh and delicious! We finished off with the creme brûlée and it was to die for! Not too sweet but rich and creamy in flavor. I highly recommend this gem! Oh and did I mention the staff is super friendly and efficient?!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast 2 days while staying at Delta. Better than concierge level where food was sent up early in the morning and not refreshed as often (or cooked in front of you).   Husband had the salmon which he liked. I had pancakes, yoghurt and fruit from the buffet. Our 2 year old had hard boiled eggs which he loved. Great accommodation for the family. Nice staff. Can't beat complimentary food as a Marriott member."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday evening for a friend's birthday.  Soco is located inside the Delta Toronto hotel on Lower Simcoe but the street entrance is on the Brenmer Blvd side.  Being part of the building of 75 Simcoe and being the main restaurant in the hotel you can also access the restaurant from the hotel lobby.  Soco has a couple seating areas, one facing Brenmer, an outdoor section which is seasonal and the main dining area which consists of the bar, lounge area with long couch seating as well as low and high top tables.  We were seating adjacent to the lounge area with attached tables and although the seats were pretty much touching one another, the seating was very comfortable and the chairs are wide so that it created \"buffer\" space simply by being as wide as they were.  The tables were large enough for all our drinks and the wide variety of starters we had coming our way one after another while Alex our server had our drinks well taken care of.  At one point I had just finished my drink and Alex came by like a ninja and asked me if I'd like another.  I was so surprised I almost had trouble saying yes.  The variety of starters we sampled were all very good.  The cheese and crostini was first with a variety of soft and hard cheeses it was a nice sized starter for sharing.  Next came the Mezze which was another share plate which consisted of a smoked pepper and ricotta dip and a spicy chickpea hummus with a generous bowl of olives and a side of warm flat bread.  The hummus tasted great and wasn't too spicy.  The pepper and ricotta dip although it had a tiny kick it also was not hot and overly spicy but rather a very nice definitive taste.  The charcuterie had a nice variety of salami and mustard seed and toast.  While the toast was good I preferred the warm flatbread that came with the dips.  My wife had wanted to try the corn chowder because it's one of her favorite soups.  The bowl came empty with a few kernels of popcorn in the bowl with some cilantro leaves and the soup was poured from a decanter into the bowl in front of her.  The soup had an amazing taste of mildly sweet corn but with the smallest of late spice kick of jalapeno peppers.  This dish was not too hot for my wife and she normally cannot handle hot at all and it was perfect for her.  The soup is more of a thinner consistency but the taste is great.  There are small cubes of chorizo to add another flavor to the mix of soup as well so it's sweet and savory with a hint of spice to finish.  Amazing flavor for the corn chowder soup...  My wife had ordered the lobster tagliatelle as her main but because she ate so many starters she basically barely touched it.  I tasted it and it was rich with that lobster while the pasta dish itself is not something I have very often considering I don't eat lobster that often.  It now is today's lunch for me.  For my main I went with the steak, medium rare.  I enjoy a good steak from time to time and this was cooked medium rare as requested, not overcooked and a good size.  The potatoes that accompanied the fine cut had a chimichurri sauce but I had wished it had more.  It was very light to the point I didn't get too much of a taste of it.  The mustard and herb butter compound on the steak added another level of taste to the steak.  As it melted it added a nice tang to the meat that wasn't too lubricated but rather nice with the potatoes and asparagus as well.     On the side I couldn't resist ordering the 5 cheese mac and cheese and adding the braised beef option to it.  The mac and cheese came in a what looked to be about a 2 cup sized bowl topped with bread crumbs.  On the menu this mac and cheese dish is listed as a side and it's also listed as the 2015 and 2016 Toronto Mac & Cheese best of festival champion.  I'm sorry to say I think those descriptions raised the bar for my expectations in that I was expecting to be blown away and I just was not.  The mac and cheese for me seemed rather runny and a touch sweet.  I prefer savory and rich mac and cheese over this offering.  The braised beef added a dimension of change of texture and flavor of course but not enough to counter the sweetness of the sauce.  While it was nice to try I wouldn't recommend it to those expecting a saltier, richer and more savory mac and cheese.    Overall the presentation, quality and service of Soco is very good, not quite mind blowing 5* but definitely better than average for their variety and tastes.  Nothing seemed overly bold but nothing was sadly tame either.  The service we received was exceptional as the staff couldn't seem to do enough for us."}
{"text":"There were 4 of us eating and we ordered 2 calamaris and 3 dishes of seabass and one lobster pasta.  We were all still hungry when we left.   Our bill came to $230.  Holy cow!!! Not only was it expensive we were still hungry.  In addition we waited over an hour for our food.  We were there on a Saturday night.  I would not recommend this place to anyone!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. I came for lunch on two separate occasions and was not disappointed. If you're not sure what to order, here are a few tips. The sauce on the Brussels sprouts didn't taste like anchovies at all, huge plus. The fries have a great crispy coat on the outside and are nice and soft on the inside. The white sauce they come with is superb...definitely easy to get carried away.  Their hangar steak was cooked perfectly for all three of our orders and mine was cooked rare and was not stringy or chewy at all. The shrimp in my romaine and kale salad was cooked well but I guess if I had to make one comment, there was too much dressing overall. We also got the meatballs, which I didn't try, but were told we're good. Lastly, we ordered the tuna tartare and some of the cubes were still extremely cold or had frost bite on the inside. Not sure which. Service second day was better than first, we got the vibe our waiter day one was not a fan of us... The desserts won everyone over (Rocher and PB puffs). I highly recommend both, great presentation and good complexity of flavors. Overall, for a hotel restaurant it's a very solid place."}
{"text":"Summary: at best, average food and terribly unprofessional staff.  What started of as a three star experience turned into a one star experience within 10 min. We decided to stop here for lunch based on reviews and location to where we were at the time. After the looking at the menu we decided to try. Food was average at best, nothing special in particular about the menu. The portions and price  were expected of a hotel restaurant so we didn't expect amazing food,  but we did expect good service as it is inside a hotel. For a restaurant that was half empty it took over 25 min. to get our meals (4 plates total). Strike one.  Our waitress notified us after 15min of waiting that the kitchen was behind (again I emphasize half empty restaurant). We let the delay go as we understand things happen. I personally got the smoked salmon eggs benedict. One out of the two poached eggs were solid (no runny yolk). I told the waitress and she kindly brought me out two more.  Again, one out of the two eggs was solid. Strike two. How can a restaurant hotel with I'm sure professional culinary staff get 2/4 poached eggs wrong? I decided not to think anything of it since our waitress was nice and accommodating. Then came the bill. They overcharged us for drinks where prices were clearly printed on the menu. I can tell you the amount was neglible (normally I would have just left it as extra tip for the waitress). She asked if we would like the difference (first of all upon principle she shouldn't have asked and just given us the refund;  what if it have been a larger mistake?).  We asked for the refund. She said she would get the manager as she did not have approval, however she decided to take another tables order (another 8 min) before going to get a manager. Another 10 min later the manager finally came out to speak with her. He then laughed it off and walked away. He did not even acknowledge us or the mistake or apologize. Strike three. They had over charged on a price that was clearly printed on their menu. They did not resolve the issue in a timely manner,  and they didn't acknowledge their mistake. Either the waitress made an error or their system is programmed incorrectly. To Soco management,  it is the unprofessional actions of this \"manager\" for which you can thank for this one star review. I will not be recommending this restaurant to anybody nor will I have positive feedback when asked my opinion. I will say your waitress was nice and apologized but dragged her feet through the entire process. Damage done. Not impressed what so ever.    **forgot to mention, restaurant was empty when we arrived and still was asked to wait 5 min for a table."}
{"text":"Stopped by this bar which is ideally located under the shadow of the CN Tower when they had a rather brilliant special; $3 oysters and $5 ceasars. While tasty, they were nothing to write home about. Service was decent and the appetizers were relatively reasonably priced with the cheese tray offering acceptable value. Nothing super special here but definitely one of the better places for a bite and drink in close proximity to the tower."}
{"text":"Chose this spot as we were staying at the Delta Hotel.  Breakfast was quick & delicious.  I had eggs with gluten free toast & bacon.  Great fruit bowl came with it! My son had the pancakes (not GF) & really enjoyed them.  Buffet is pricey ($33/pp during week) - but breakfast options off menu were at a price you'd expect.  Great service!!"}
{"text":"This place was meh. Super overpriced for what it was. We got bloody caesars and they were not good at all -- super watered down, warm, and seriously lacking flavor. They brought a tub of ice on the side, which I found kinda odd since drinks are typically brought to you at the right temperature, not with a side of ice to cool down the hot alcohol brought to you. We shared the Meze platter, which came with pita with hummus as well as some smoky cheese dip, plus some olives. This was pretty tasty. I also had some of my cousin's burger and it was tasty which makes me think you should just stick with the food here, NOT their drinks (even though 'bar' is in their name). I did like the place itself, it was designed very well and sleek, with nice seating along huge windows."}
{"text":"I remember the Mac and cheese festival last year and that this restaurant had won. I remember that their food was absolutely delicious and I've always wanted to check out this restaurant. We got there pretty late, about eight or nine pm. I'm glad they're open until late and serving food at this time. My day was pretty hectic so it was a great way to relax. The service was quick since we beat the dinner rush. Our choice was fairly easy as to whether or not we would sit at the patio. It was the ideal choice. I loved that patio! It was very cosy! I loved how the area was casual but still romantic. Our server was a pretty laid back guy. He took our order pretty quickly and was pretty attentive to us. He was also pretty helpful with our drink orders. I was  little hesitant on getting bourbon with an iced tea but he assured me that it was a good choice. Which he was true to his word. It wasn't watered down, quiet the opposite and pretty damn strong. That definitely got my vote. Our appetizer was the half dozen oysters. The plate was big but the portion was kinda small. There was too much garnish for the oyster. So it made it more topping than shellfish to taste. I had more tangy tastes than the oyster taste which I was banking on more than the little \"amuse-bouche\". We added some bread with our oysters. I like how soft the bread was with that added contrast to hard crust. It was perfect to grab and pick up while you're dipping the bread. Not to mention it tasted really good with the oysters, I was alternating my bites between the two. Best choice! Next was the lobster tagliatelle. It was delicious! I can't stop raving about it!!! The dish was creamy and smooth. The portion was absolutely perfect. The ratio of pasta and little lobster chunky goodies was just the right thing to hit the spot.  I would have ordered that Mac and cheese as a side for something but I guess that only means that I would need to come back. And trust me, I will!"}
{"text":"I stay at the Delta about once a month on business to Toronto. This is my favorite hotel restaurant. The mushroom soup is my favorite anywhere. The staff are friendly and it's a nice clean restaurant. I've yet to have a bad dish and have really enjoyed every meal I've had. Other than the mushroom soup I haven't had anything earth shattering but it is a good solid restaurant. I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Service was great and if you're staying at the Delta you're able to charge to the room.   The food is good.  But we've been here before and the menu needs to change it up a bit. You get the same food as you do when you order room service which kinda ruins the room service shtick for me.   The restaurant has a nice atmosphere with booths and tables with a view of the open concept kitchen, which is always a cool treat..  SOCO Burgers were great and the price is good for Toronto"}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant is not at least 4 stars. Our experience was great. Came here on a Tuesday night for a work function with 19 other colleagues. Restaurant was 50% full. Design and layout of the restaurant is very nice. Service was great, with one main server and many different runners who all did a great job serving us. We shared some apps, a mixed salad with pears and apples, excellent pizza, olives and dips, all very tasty.  Everyone was allowed to order from the menu. The highlight was my main the sea bass, one of the best fish dishes I have EVER had, made with a miso sauce - not really sure what everything was on the dish since it was dark -  but trust me it was awesome. Dessert was a mix platter of their specialties served by the chef. All and all a great dinner experience, definitely be back..."}
{"text":"After visiting this place many time I have finally decided to write a review. This restaurant belongs to the Delta Hotel, and this is why I come here so often, I always stay at the Delta when I come downtown.   The menu here is nothing special they have the staples of any hotel menu, while everything is prepared correctly, well seasoned, and has a nice presentation; I feel the food lacks a \"WOW\" factor. Everything seems very ordinary to me, like the way the flat bread looks like a pizza, even though is just flat bread. The food is good but not exceptional, plus they don't have something that is uniquely theirs. Something that makes their restaurant stand out.   A few weeks back they were selling hotdogs outside on the street making competition for the hard working hotdog vendors that depend on that for their livelihood. \"Good job SOCO!\" he said in a sarcastic tone...  Over all this place is not bad, however, it's not great either."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice meal here with former coworkers for a girls night over the holidays.  Pretty close to the ACC so a great place to grab a bite before a sporting event, concert, etc.  We all ordered various items and everyone seemed to enjoy. I opted for the mac and cheese (I had a serious craving plus they are supposedly famous for it) with a side salad. The dish was very tasty and comforting, definitely hit the spot.   Our server was super sweet and even brought us a dessert to share in honour of my new job (thanks girl!).  Would return for drinks or food if in this area again."}
{"text":"Soco is a popular restaurant for a very good reason. The food is amazing. Who doesn't love some good ol southern cooking. The only draw back is that the wait can be an animal. I have never been able to go there spontaneously and get a table. We actually always end up leaving. So do your self a favor and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch with my mum. She got the steak and frites while I got the veggie burger. We enjoyed both our dishes, it was nothing out of the ordinary yet enjoyable. The garlic salt on the fries were a great touch with the aioli dipping sauce. They also have a phone charging station which was a life saver!   I'm rating this restaurant as a 3 because the menus were just standard and my beer was not cold. It felt like the bottle has been sitting out for good 20 minutes. Beer should always be extra cold.. the water was also lukewarm. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"My husband and I both ordered drink. We had lamb pizza, which the meat is wrapped inside and very filling. I ordered Mac and cheese including the pork - 3 extra. My husband is not a Mac and cheese person, but this time, he liked it. The mushroom soup is okay but came with a really big bowl. The dessert we had is the cheese cake with Yuzu toppings and a piece of motcha cookie. Everything tastes good. Service is average. Good ambience. My three year old son enjoyed all the dishes, he's a picky yelper. When it comes to the bill, it really surprised us. We can not believe it's only 71 in total. Such a nice restaurant with good location and low price. Very worth to try!"}
{"text":"Food was suuuuper good, service was amazing as well. Had the meatball and fries and Brussels sprouts. Omg good. Sat on the patio and watched the people go by while enjoying cocktails. Really great night in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Their wood oven pizza tasted really good. Although I think their dessert is the best. Could skip main and swap them for their desserts easily."}
{"text":"Have only been for dinner, not brunch. Overall, 4/5. Highly recommend going to Soco before catching a game or concert at the ACC or Rogers Centre.  Ambiance: We arrived around 7pm, looking for a bite to eat before heading to the Jays game. There were a few groups heading to the game as well, and a few people who were likely staying at the hotel. The restaurant was modern and clean.  Food: We went on a Tuesday night and they had a special- $21 for a pint of Steamwhistle and the Bacon Cheeseburger. We also ordered fries and the Fig Flatbread Pizza. The burger was phenomenal!  Fries were thin and crispy, covered in Parmesan which made them even tastier. The pizza was sweet and delicious. When I come back, I probably won't order the pizza again but will definitely opt for the burger.  Service: There were about 3 hostesses at the time, who seated us immediately. We waited a bit longer than expected for our food, but our waitress was kind and attentive.  Location: In the core of downtown, connected to the Delta hotel, a few minutes away from the ACC and Rogers Centre.   Price: Average for downtown and the area. A meal for two cost about $50 plus tax and tip."}
{"text":"We found this on accident as everything was closed for the Christmas holiday!  Glad we did our breakfast brunch was top notch, same goes for our server!  Good job"}
{"text":"Looking for a brunch spot on a Sunday and went here. The mac and cheese was amazing, highly recommend it. Also had the lobster omelette which was delicious. would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great meal and good vibes."}
{"text":"Cam here because I wasn't in the mood to go somewhere far from where I was staying.After looking at some reviews and taking a look at some picture, my girlfriend and I decided to take a chance on this place. It was short walk from the Intercontinental, where we were saying.   We arrived around 6 and expected to wait some time before being seated. We were seated immediately which was great. The staff was young and super energetic, which made me look forward to ordering food. When we arrived, they had just recently launched a new dinner menu which made us feel pretty hopeful to try something and refreshing. When I did check-in on the yelp app, I received %25 off any appetizer voucher which the manager changed to a free appetizer.  For our appetizer, we ordered calamari, and we were less than impressed. Every time that we bit into a piece, we couldn't help but cringe a little at the fact that it was little undercooked. Unfortunately, we didn't end up finishing the calamari. As for food, I ordered a bacon wrapped double burger which was described a lot better by our waitress than it, actually, tasted. The beef was bland and thick It lacked a lot of seasoning. There was a lot cheese, which is never a bad thing, but still didn't add enough to the burger. Sadly, the highlight of my entree were the fries. There were cooked really well and went great with the artichoke dip given to me. My girlfriend ordered the Diavola flatbread pizza. She liked it a lot. The chorizo and salami were cooked really well. The chorizo, in particular, had a strong spicy kick. For one person, it was very filling."}
{"text":"Very good food and drinks.  A bit pricey but the quality is there.  Be prepared for a bit of pretentiousness.   Mac and cheese was bomb!"}
{"text":"I came here Saturday morning. There is a buffet option and a-la carte option available. There were seats available, so there was no wait even at 10 am.  This restaurant is located at the base of the Delta hotel, which is steps away from CNE and Ripley's Aquarium.  I ordered the shanshouka which are poach eggs in a bed of red pepper stew. It is also served with two polish sausages. There is an option for the side to be fruit or home fries.  I quite enjoyed the shanshouka - it was a bit of a higher end affair because of the location of the restaurant, but all the parts were seasoned well. I ordered the fruit side and there was a variety of fruit (melon, pineapple and berries)  The portions are just right at this place. You will not leave too full or too hungry after eating breakfast here."}
{"text":"Great service! Nathan was our server and he was professional, warm, and welcoming. Food was amazing, just got a hold of the new menu that came out last Saturday. The flat breads is strongly recommended to anyone dropping in."}
{"text":"SOCO Kitchen + Bar is located within the Delta Toronto hotel. While my brother was getting a late night snack, my mom and I decided to accompany him and get dessert.  My brother ordered a Mezze, which consisted of charred eggplant purée, spiced chickpea and garlic hummus, and smoked olives and served with grilled pita. I got to this this dish and really enjoyed fresh pita with the charred eggplant purée and smoked olives.  I ordered a Vanilla Creme Brûlée and a Tazo Tea - China Green Tips. The Vanilla Creme Brûlée was served chilled. The Creme Brûlée had a custard topped with a thick layer of sugar coating that was difficult to break with a spoon. The Creme Brûlée was garnished with fresh berries (e.g., blackberry, blueberry, and raspberry) and served with a cinnamon shortbread.   My mom ordered a Raspberry Sorbet, which consisted of two scoops of homemade raspberry sorbet served with fresh berries."}
{"text":"Came here with friends on the Civic Holiday for lunch before we went to do our Edgewalk at the CN Tower. We were a party of 6.   We were seated quite quickly (+1) and served water almost immediately after we were seated. The glasses were a little dirty, so that kind of set the tone.  I ordered the SOCO burger and I tried some of my boyfriend's pizza. The pizza was OK (+0.5; ~2-3 stars in taste)...but it had a very strong aftertaste of basil. Basil is generally one of those spices that a pinch too much can absolutely ruin something. The burger was well cooked (+0.5), but the seasoning wasn't very good.  I wasn't really impressed, but that's generally expected when you eat at a hotel bar. Cost of food definitely wasn't worth the price ($20.00 for a BURGER????), and you could easily get better pub food across the street."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. They have a nice buffet set up. Problem is they close the buffet at 9 o'clock in the morning. Clearly designed only for businessmen and women going to work. Which puts people like me who are in  a different industry somewhat at odds. So I was seated, and basically got one run through of the buffet to grab what I wanted. The next time I walk through it was gone. Not so impressive for $27  Service also seemed a little distant. The table next to me was leaving and made the comment \"I don't know what happened to our server\".   I also think for that amount for breakfast buffet, they should be making omelettes or poached eggs to order."}
{"text":"I ordered the house Bloody Mary and fries. I needed a quick break after walking around Toronto. I was impressed by the garnish and delighted by the flavor of the Bloody Mary. The fries reinforce the Canadian's love of them. Nicely prepared with an aioli for dipping. The fried sage was a refreshing touch.   The bartender was nice but didn't have any suggestions on the city. Located on the corner across from RIpley's Aquarium.  Popplepassions would return."}
{"text":"Ok.. yeah.. it's cool.. I got sucked in by the sidewalk sign.. The breakfast was laid out pretty nicely and I guess with the smoked salmon and whole cheeserie, as I'm typing this I recall a lot of overheard asking about omelettes, and I feel like I should investigate that.. Do they offer omelettes? I did get coffee in a nice pot placed with me, but was there juice and stuff even included? I didn't even notice the whole other side with the pastries on the buffet thing.. I guess I should've asked for more direction from staff? I was asked about a menu but I thought nah I'll do the buffet.. I mean really I just wanted a power outlet because I rolled in dt early before work and I wanted to eat and charge my phone to tether and work, so I did, and then I got the bill, and WOT.. over $40 with regrettably-adequate tip.. But then ok it's RIGHT downtown, and in a hotel I think? Sigh. I'll grab a menu next time....."}
{"text":"Went here for a bite after work with some coworkers. It was described to me as a good late night food option with a decent kitchen.  We sat at a high top table close to the bar. Good set up and the decor is very polished and clean. Server was friendly and joked around with the table, gave suggestions for the food and drinks.   Two of my colleagues ordered the beef Mac and cheese, another the prosciutto flat bread, and I got the beef burger. Sides of fries were ordered too, mine came with. The burger was interesting, but after deliberation, not great. Our server asked how things were and I answered good which was a knee jerk response and not disingenuous but like I said, after thinking it over I wouldn't order it again. It wasn't really bad...it just didn't taste like a burger to me. The patty had almost a purée like texture to it, and I felt the bbq sauce on it didn't match with the other flavors. The presentation was good, serving time was good, it was cleanly put together and cooked how it was supposed to be. It had some spices and herbs that looked like chilli's. Maybe it's just not my type of burger.   The fries were good. I like shoestring fries, which these were, double fried and served with dried mint leaves. They were tasty. The mayo side was infused with other favoring and was good.  The flatbread was done well but the table felt rather uninspiring. Flavor was just okay and it was kind of dry. Apparently they used to have a sausage flatbread which was better.  I didn't have the Mac and cheese, but the reviews from my colleagues were good and it's $7! That's pretty good considering the location and the popularity of Mac and cheese these days. And it's an award winner! Thumbs up.  Not a bad place to go. Service was good, prices a bit high but reasonable, atmosphere was comfy. Check it out"}
{"text":"Ok food, not worth the money...ambiance was fine. Was there for breakfast... buffet was $29-33!"}
{"text":"In Toronto, just visiting because, well, why not and we stopped in on this place after a long day of being all touristy and what not.   Located in downtown Toronto, inside of the Delta Hotel, entrances within the hotel and from the street.  There is indoor and outdoor seating available.  The interior of the restaurant is beautiful, everything is open and airy.  You can seek the kitchen, as they place items up for the various tables.  I thought it was pretty awesome.   On this date, we chose to sit on the patio, which is really nice and spacious.  The hotel is pretty cool, as they have various specials from Monday-Saturday.  On this date, they had a special for a pitcher of margarita and for padron peppers.   We ate family style and tried the mezze, salmon, lamb skewers, padron peppers, macaroni and cheese and two flatbreads.  First things first, let's start with the sangria.  Just dope.  We decided on the red; what a delightful mix of blueberries and blackberries, that ended with a slight buzz.  I must say it was one of the best that I had.    The duo of hummus' that came with the Mezze platter in addition to the pita and olives was a nice opening to what was to come.  The hummus was fresh, and the olives added a nice top to the garlicky spread.  The pitas were warm and fresh.   The salmon, albeit, a side was cooked nicely, and seasoned the same way too.  I tasted the lamb; although generally not a fan, it was seasoned nicely and was quite tender.  The flatbreads were delicious!  The sauce that accompanied them added a nice kick to the spice of the I believe sausage.  The second pizza with house smoked bacon and sweet onion was a nice treat.  The macaroni and cheese wasn't overly cheesy and the mix of cheeses..woah.  Just good.   I'd say that the sleeper were those peppers.  I wanted to try something new, and they were awesome, not overly seasoned, but had a nice smoky flavor.  I believe one in about five have a kick.  But honestly, however they cooked them was to perfection.  For dessert, we tried the lemon tart and the mango sherbet, again, delicious!.    We loved the place so much we wanted to come back.    Our server, was on it!  She was so attentive to our party, and recommend some great dishes.  I'm not really sure why this place has less than stellar reviews based on experience and some of the other patrons on that date.  If I come back to visit, I'm so going back."}
{"text":"One of the better food choices if you want to stay away from the high concentration of pubs or bars in the area. Attached to the Delta Hotel, the service is attentive and there is plenty of seats in a slightly fancier environment to enjoy a drink or watch a game.   I walked in fully intending to order a salad, but got waylayed by the 5 cheese mac and cheese on the menu. It was creamy, heavy. and comforting. I was only able to finish half of it, so maybe the better plan is to split it with someone and order something healthy to counter balance all the carbs and cheese."}
{"text":"Four stars because their mac & cheese is amazing. The service could be better in my opinion. This place is obviously more high-scale, and I came with two friends and we were dressed more casual than the other groups there. So I feel like we weren't paid attention to as much as the rest of them. No big deal though, the servers were still friendly when they came around and like I said, that mac & cheese was so good! My friend also tried one of their flatbreads, the cheese one. Also very yummy. Clean place, except there were a couple flies that kept buzzing around. Would definitely come back to try other dishes (and for the mac & cheese lol)."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner after visiting the CN Tower. Great outdoor space. The Salmon and the Lobster Tagliatelle were very tasty. This place is located in the Delta Hotel in the entertainment district. I loved décor of the restaurant and the hotel from what I saw of it. Great restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Taste: 3 Service: 4 Value: 3 Presentation: 4 Overall: 3.5 rounded up to 4  Hi and welcome to another episode of javing it with Javier. Let's see what we are javing today. Trying out the steak and frites today. My coworker told me they serve godlike fries, possibly her favourite fries of all time. My dish comes with the soco fries so I'm excited to try them.  Wow the portion sizes were huge! At least my coworkers' dishes were. I had my 7oz steak but my plate had a lot of fries on it. Trying out the steak, immediately I could tell that it would be disappointing. It wasn't cooked well at all and didn't even taste like steak. But moving onto the feature (lol?), these soco fries were crispy with garlic, parmesan, chopped herbs and caper aioli sprinkled on top. And if that wasn't enough for you, they provide you with a creamy garlic sauce to dip your fries in mmmmmmm! I personally prefer my fries slightly crispier, but I would stand by my coworker's claim that these are the best fries given that. Regardless though, the flavour packed into these fries were utterly addicting. Disclaimer: if you are a vampire I am not responsible for any injury as a result of trying these delicious fries.  The service was pretty good throughout our meal. Food came relatively quickly and waiter came periodically to give us refill on water and ask for refills of beer. No complaints there.  Now in terms of the value, $26 for steak and fries is quite cheap by Toronto's standards. So, I wasn't extremely surprised by the quality of the steak when it arrived. The portion sizes were huge though and I was quite stuffed. On the other hand, if you only want to try their fries, it's only $7 for an order which is a little bit on the pricier side but well justifies the price in my opinion.  In conclusion, don't let the fact that this restaurant is located in a hotel discourage you. I had a great meal here and would be excited to come back for their fries every so often. And that's it for today's episode of javing it with Javier. And remember food is life!"}
{"text":"Our stay at Delta Hotel included breakfast BUT it was just an allotment of $75 for two people. That means everything had a price so if you wanted another juice even though you were eating the buffet, you had to pay out-of-pocket.  At 9:30 AM, we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated for breakfast even though there were empty tables."}
{"text":"Service is not great. Sat down and waited just under 10min(yes I timed it) until I could even flag down the bartenders attention. No hello or apology for the wait from the bartender either. Got our drinks one had a chipped glass. The bartender remade it but it tasted like there was less alcohol than the original drink. Tried flagging down the manager. He looked at me then walked away completely ignoring me. Only after we paid our tab did we get an apology for the wait. Over all we were planning on staying for food and more drinks but after the crap service we moved on. The atmosphere was nice otherwise it would have been one star. There are many other cool places to hit. I would skip this one."}
{"text":"Our cross country journey continues...  Soco kitchen is an awesome people watching spot. Sit outside and watch everyone walk past. In between Rogers Center (home of the blue jays) and the air Canada centre  (Barbara streisand was performing tonight) there was no lack of entertainment.  Great service!  Ask for Sonia...  the lamb koefta and the mezza was above average."}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday night with a bunch of my colleagues.  We ordered a bunch of items and shared.  We started of with the mezze (piquillo pepper and smoked ricotta dip/ spiced chickpea hummus/ smoked olives/ grilled flatbread).  The sauce was flavourful, olives was def smoked and there was nothing special about the flatbread.  Next, we tried the CrispyChorizo Croquettes which tasted good- it was warm and soft.  The Funghi flatbread we had tasted okay- there were not a lot of toppings and I felt like I mainly had carbs.  I really enjoy the Soppresata flatbread as it was very flavourful and had a nice kick of spice.  The mac and cheese was also very good, we paid an additional $2.50 for braised beef and upgraded to a bigger portion for $7 more.  I highly recommend getting the Soopresata flatbread & Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"Stayed in the Delta for a few weeks so I ended up here a couple of times. The food is fine, if nothing special, and a bit pricey in my opinion. The service I received was strange, and my dinner was punctuated by the incessant screeching from a table of ~15 women near me, which made it nearly impossible to hear anything else, including my server. I understand that the screaming wasn't by any fault of the restaurant itself, but it nonetheless made the experience that much more unpleasant."}
{"text":"It took 12 min after sitting down at the table in a normal not so busy restaurant before the server came through to ask for H2O or order. 12 min. The server was quite good after but 12min! C'mon.   Great ambiance. the Baileys Horchata quite nice, the Old Fashioned wasn't an old fashioned. Bartender mistake. Gave me a Manhattan instead. Old fashioned made again. Decent. But why the small ice cubes!!  Sacrilege diluting it all.   The breakfast burger was not bad but the Shashuka was quite quite nice. Overall. Not a bad experience once the initial hiccup was done."}
{"text":"I've had two amazing meals in this place since I arrived in Toronto for a convention.  Breakfast: probably the most beautiful avocado toast which was delicious and lunch - a chicken sandwich with Au Jus which was so tasty that I felt compelled to review. Ask for the salad side instead of fries!! Trust me."}
{"text":"Soco is located in the new Delta hotel, right at the corner of Bremner and Lower Simcoe. Location is very convenient if you're going to a game or event downtown as it's right in between the ACC and Rogers Centre.   I went for weekend brunch and ordered the French Toast ($14) which included fresh berries and whipped cream. I found the toast to be a bit dry but the overall presentation of the food was nice.  The ambiance of the restaurant is typical for a hotel restaurant. The decor is simple and contemporary, the tables are nicely spread out. Service was good and attentive.   I would recommend stopping by because of the decent service, nice ambiance and convenient location. I thought the food was a bit pricey for the quality but I guess you are paying up for the location."}
{"text":"Hotel adjacent restaurants can be hit or miss. D'ici delivers. Quality ingredients. Interesting menu. From pub to higher end. A nice selection of cocktails, wine and beer. Although I would suggest more micro brew selections.  There service was great. Now that maybe different during busy game times.  But it did appear they had enough staff."}
{"text":"Soco est un restaurant de l'hôtel Delta donnant directement sur la rue. C'est un bon endroit pour venir manger après avoir fait un tour à la CN Tour.  L'endroit est assez récent il me semble et j'ai pu remarquer qu'au niveau du personnel c'était pas encore très organisé (5 personnes différentes se sont occupées de nous durant le repas, un peu déroutant!) et notre commande est arrivée deux fois et présentée d'abord à la table d'à côté.  A part ça : mon burger était bon. les frites aussi même si un chouilla trop salées. La carte n'est pas très grande mais propose de tout : des pâtes, des viandes, des pizzas. De quoi contenter tout le monde.   Soco est aussi un bar où sont retransmis les matchs de hockey notamment : attention, c'est assez bruyant comme ambiance !"}
{"text":"I came here for a grand opening event thrown by ApéroChic and sponsored by Grand Marnier (an orange-flavored liqueur). It was a very stylish, classy, and chill event. The service was great, the rooftop itself has a gorgeous, unique view of the surrounding area, and the couch/cabana seating is nice and spaced out. It is probably the most spacious roof tops one could linger on. They could probably toss a few goats up there and a donkey for good measure.  Definitely a sophisticated, older more mature crowd at the event I went to. I can't speak to what the usual sort of patrons would be, but I am guessing overall a classy place to go chill. And literally chill, you could probably doze off into a glorious nap in the sun on one of their pretty pink couches. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Sunday.  Very slow service, kept forgetting our ordered items, never checked on us (had to go into restaurant 3x to get server).  Food was expensive and subpar.  Will not go back again"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch and drinks with friends. It has a nice patio where you can seat either in the sun or in the shade. They also have a outdoor sofas section.   Our server was very professional, there at the good time and made sure our water was replenished. We were thinking to order a pitcher of sangria, but he told us we would have more for our money by ordering a tall glass. Kudos for being honest!   Speaking of the sangria, it was just great! I had a white sangria with lots of berries in it and it really was refreshing.   I then had the Soppressata Flatbread (basically a pizza). 4/5. Good portion, interesting mix of spicy and sweet with the chili honey. I also tasted the Funghi Flatbread and it was has great. Usually not a fan of vegetarian pizzas but this one was tasteful."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was mediocre, esp for the prices. Took the lobster omelet off my bill at least. Very bland and not well  presented. I'd not return here. Sorry, SOCO."}
{"text":"Simply one of the best places i have tried till now in Toronto. We had the Calamari and the spinach salad..They were amazing..The duck was out of this world and the dessert..words can't even describe it. I am so glad that i tried them out."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night. Food wasn't  terrible, but nothing special. The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired. It really does feel like a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is attached to a hotel so I feel like it gets overlooked by the Yelp world. The food is great and there is so much space it's also good for large parties. We had around 16 people and they were amazingly accommodating. I had to call and ask to move out reservation to half an hour later and they were happy to accommodate.   I had the fish main dish and although the portion is smaller, it had very good flavour. I would wish that there were more vegetables given with my dish. We also ordered the bread basket and the shareable with dip - the hummus dip was really good and it was great for our large table to share (we ordered a couple of each).   I also had their coconut dessert which was off the charts! It tasted perfectly like coconut and felt exotic in the heart of Toronto! I would recommend it for sure :)"}
{"text":"Chef Kieth & Chef Mike prepared for us an impressive and delectable tasting dinner menu for my Mom's birthday. Not only were the staff incredibly warm and hospitable, but the Chef's prepared for us an array of land & sea, beautifully plated, and even more pleasing to the taste buds. Even the dessert was out of this world! This restaurant remains a true gem in Downtown Toronto. Thank you to Chef Mike & Chef Keith and their entire #socokitchenandbar team!"}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of friends on a Friday night. The restaurant wasn't too busy then.. Most likely cause it's still newish. It's in the new Delta hotel beside the Ripley's aquarium (and you can walk in the PATH and SKYWALK to get to Delta without going outside in the cold). The interior and decor, imo, was very nice - quite modern.   Service was good and the food came fast. I got a hot water (due to the extreme cold that Toronto is), and it came with a generous wedge of lemon, and it was nice of them to give me a pot of hot water as well for refills.   However the dish I ordered was quite underwhelming. I got the lobster pasta. For $23, I expected more. There was sufficient lobster in it for the price but the pasta itself was not cooked very well. It clumped together and felt dry and was just not very flavourful. My other friends ordered this pasta as well and thought the same thing. One of my friends got the half roasted chicken and felt that it was quite good. Perhaps the lobster pasta was the wrong thing to order here?"}
{"text":"This restaurant/bar is attached to the Delta Hotel and is open with full menu nightly till about 2 AM.  Standards on the menu include several flatbread pizzas, a burger, and a number of appetizers, as well as a brunch menu on the weekends. They have a good selection of Canadian beers on tap, including Steamwhistle and Blanche de Chambly.  the cheese plate, with a selection of Canadian cheeses, was excellent, and the oysters were good.   Soco Kitchen is justly known for one of their desserts: small, profiterole-sized cream puffs filled with an addictively good peanut butter cream, served rather dramatically on a stone platter with a side of ice cream.  They can get busy during lunch, particularly as they are across the street from the convention center. Service remains prompt and professional. The food was so good that I had several meals here during the stay, even though I wanted to get out and explore more of the local restaurants. Highly recommend this for dinner or late-night."}
{"text":"Our first visit here and enjoyed our lunch. Ordered the Mac & Cheese, Grilled Calamari, Piri Piri Chicken and Salmon.  The kids ordered from the kids menu..peanut butter & jelly sandwich with fries & pizza.  Everything was delicious.  Didn't really care for the Piri Piri Chicken but the sides that comes along with it was delicious. The service was excellent. We sat on the patio and enjoyed the sun.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"A detour to refresh and recharge our batteries while going between Niagara Falls and the Thousand Islands and we stumbled upon this place when the other places like the CN Tower and Ripley's Aquarium had hundreds of people already in lines that your kids wouldn't be able to wait in.  (And you tried to get them to check out Steam Whistle Brewery across the way but they're only 7 and can't hold their alcohol yet.)  Regardless... you're here and it feels hip and trendy and you're an Italian from North Jersey but you still risk ordering a pasta dish up here in Toronto and they nailed it.  Yeah, those flabby hunks of bacon aren't the norm down where you're from but somehow they work wonders with the dandelion greens and cheeses and all the other goodies they snuck onto the plate.  All of our food was done solid and they sold Steam Whistle (score!) so that tasty cold beer helped to keep you cool while eating outside in the summer heat.  (We ventured inside just for a quick minute and it looked pretty spiffy as well.)"}
{"text":"There is a lot to like about SOCO. Normally I tend to stay away from restaurants that are adjacent to hotels since they usually overcharge for mediocre food, but I am glad to say SOCO does not fit into that mould.  We came here on a Wednesday night and the place was packed and lively, which speaks volumes in itself. The interior here is modern and very much fits with the business casual crowds that streams here for post-work food and drinks.  Executive chef Keith Pears (winner of Chopped Canada!), and sous chef Micheal Hawryluk are doing a fantastic job with the menu here, as is pastry chef Engin Tiryaki. The food here has minor creative elements to it that adds to the dish while keeping them familiar and approachable.  We had a sampling of various dishes for the night, some highlights include: - Grilled Striploin with twice baked potato, watercress salad and mushroom ketchup (great dish for $34) - Duck confit (Absolutely delicious) - Prawn tagliatelle (hearty pasta that would please anyone) - Delta whiskey caramel chocolate cake (so good that I didn't want to share!) - Apple bites (another fantastic dessert)  Service throughout the night was at a reasonable pace for a very busy restaurant.  Overall, I find the pricing here very reasonable considering the quality and taste of the food, and I find it extremely comparable with other downtown Toronto restaurants. I would not hesitate to come back here. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I must of walked by Soco a million times over the past 3 years but never actually walked in until today!  I always assumed it would be overpriced with mediocre food because of the location (right by ACC) but boy was I wrong!  Not only is the food fairy priced (for the location) it's also very creative and delicious!  My coworkers and I came here for some after work drinks and appies. I think we ordered almost everything on the menu such as meat balls, parmesan fries, fig flat bread, fries, pita bread with a variety of spreads and fried calamari.  My fav was the Parmesan fries with garlic aioli. Super crunchy, good amount of Parmesan, perfect combo with the garlic aioli.  We didn't get a chance to try any of the main dishes but it description intrigue me enough to come back for dinner.   They also have a great patio for those of us still clinching to summer weather!"}
{"text":"Their green salad is amazing! I also have their mushroom soup which was OK, and on another evening I had their lobster tagliatelle. The tagliatelle was done perfectly."}
{"text":"It was inside of our hotel. The food was ok. They have buffet in the morning. Everything was good. Service and staff are great."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with some friends, it was wonderful. The open concept atmosphere gives you the chance to physically see the food being made.  I had the burger with a Cesar salad and it was perfect. Not too much food but enough to be completely satisfied! I finished everything! The only this I would suggest is a little more dressing on the salad but thanks for keeping me somewhat healthy, haha. Cannot wait to sit on the patio this summer! The location could not be better. I'm a commuter and it is so close to Union, very easy access.  I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here after a visit at the Toronto aquarium. Very close to the entertainment district. Lots of space at the bar and in the restaurant section. Food is good but was nothing out of the ordinary for the price. The charcuterie was great. Dips were tasteless in my opinion. Flatbread was just ok but not impressed overall. Nice atmosphere and decor though with a view on the CN tower if you sit at the window. Service was ok not very helpful in giving suggestions. Overall, venue is good but food is just okay."}
{"text":"I actually quite enjoyed their lunch.   I recommend sitting in their patio area if it's not ungodly hot outside. Couched right on Bremner, the restaurant has a fairly good view of CN tower from the west side.   I personally disliked their Farmer Green Salad with shaved summer vegetables, marocona almonds, mustard cider dressing. The mustard cider dressing was way too sour, did the salad more harm than good.   Huge fan of their roast Salmon Filet with warm orzo salad, grilled asparagus, sauce gribiche. Salmon was masterly cooked, the sauce gribiche was also perfection.   I also recommend their New York cheese cake with summer berry salad and brown butter crumble. Really tasty, and just the right size for me. Did a good job blending the sweetness of the cake with the slight sourness of the berry salad. Good complementation.   By the way, good luck trying to integrate \"Soco\" / \"South Core\" into Torontonian jargon. I do agree that the Bremner area needs a better nickname, but \"Soco\" is a little too New York-wannabe.  I took a quick look at the interior of the restaurant. The decor just screams \"I am TERRIBLY BORING\" at you. Could have mistaken it for a fancier Wendy's. Too harsh?"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fabulous lunch at Soco today!   Located inside the relatively new Delta hotel.  The restaurant  was opened about 2.5 years ago.  I'm surprised that I haven't heard about this restaurant before.   Love the decor being very modern and sleek!  The selections for lunch was great.   There was lots to choose from - appetizers, entrees and flatbread.  Coming with my foodie friends, we tend to always over order.  We ordered 4 items to share for the 3 of us.   The portions were generous so 3 dishes would have been enough but we pretty much still managed to finish it all.  I honestly thought all the dishes were delicious.  We got Tuna Poke which had a really nice dressing which was so refreshing and the tuna was so fresh.   The fig flatbread was so yummy, I would probably keep coming back for this.  The grilled salmon was also perfectly done.  Excellent service!  Our server, Carley was very attentive and helpful with her recommendations.  We also got one of the appetizer for free for being a Yelp member.  This will be a place that I will be coming back and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Sorry, no pictures this time. We were too hungry to take pictures before eating. If you want to skip the details, I'll first say the food is good, the service is average, but it's a little overpriced.  I wouldn't really recommend this place for dinner, but for appetizers definitely. To share, we ordered the 5 cheese Mac and cheese, garlic fries, calamari, meatballs, and Brussels sprouts. The Mac and cheese was decent, fries were crisp and the meatballs were average. The calamari was a bit disappointing. It wasn't fried, but cooked and served with this chick pea and tomato paste. The Brussels sprouts however, were amazing. Much better than I thought. The outer layer tastes like kale chips, and it's served with what I can only assume is mayonnaise.  The dinner options were much more limited, I just opted for a burger while my friends ordered pastas and steaks. Again, I wouldn't recommend going for dinner. While the food did taste good, it was overpriced for what you were getting. In addition, service was slow and it took a long time to get our food. Also, I was a bit off put by the fact that for groups of 8+ they automatically add a tip of 18% AFTER tax (we were informed halfway through service).  I would come back, but probably only for the Brussels sprouts and fries."}
{"text":"Soco is a cute spot connected to the Delta Hotel. I liked that the menu was quite simple. I tried the mac and cheese with braised beef and a friend had the burger with fries. After 10pm, the dinner menu turns into a late night snack menu, where portions are smaller, but prices remain the same. Before going to Soco, I've read many reviews and had high expectations for their award-winning mac and cheese. I was not disappointed. I think adding the braised beef makes the dish sooo much better. The mac and cheese is REALLY heavy and cheesy. And thats why I would not complain about the portion size being smaller than their drink glass. Adding a fresh element or even a tiny side salad would help cut the amount of fat you can literally feel yourself consuming. (Not complaining, this dish would satisfy any mac and cheese craving for months!) The burger and fries were a big portion. The burger came with 2 beef patties and they were huge. Fries had a nice crunch to it. Service was fine and staff were accommodating."}
{"text":"As others have said pretty high prices but that's what you get in hotel restaurants.  Nice service. Quality food."}
{"text":"After visiting the aquarium, I came here with my crew. Unfortunately, it started raining, otherwise we would've sat in their nice outdoor patio. The food was very delicious and the presentation was outstanding. The ambience is very chic, and family friendly. Most of the customers are hotel guests and there's direct indoor access to subway from the hotel."}
{"text":"Meeting again with my dear friend who works downtown, she chose Soco because she heard it was good. Another upscale bar/resto intended for the ACC/Rogers Centre crowd. Atmosphere: 2 Stars It's loud, even though we were there mid-week. Upscale bar, with comfortable ambience  Service: 2 stars Friendly, but not attentive... I'm not a drama queen who looks to be waited on hand and foot, but please! ask me how my food is after 2-3 bites - gives me the option for feedback, or send it back.  Had to wave him down to get water refills.  It's not like it was busy - at all.  There were maybe 6 other tables.  Food: 4 stars Very good. Received at the table piping hot - I really appreciate that. We asked the server about the 'famous mac n cheese' to give his honest opinion, he said they'd changed the recipe, and not as good as before - so nay on that. ^  Roasted Brussels Sprouts:( I love this veg anyway), and given this cooking method - they were pretty good, though I'd ask for well done next time. since they were hard/raw in the middle. *Oh my gosh! talk about poor presentation! Black/dark plate for what are already charred dish?? *Big fail. It honestly looks terrible table side - but taste is good. ^ My friend had salad & added shrimp to make it more substantial. Very nice - light - shrimp cooked properly ^  I had a fish entrée with faro, the 'kale' that came with was a sad, wilted singular leaf beneath the fish.  I'll forgive that since, fish, thank god! wasn't dry. Cooked properly ^  Dessert (we don't usually indulge) but the server (when he decided to show up) highly recommended the chocolate peanut butter dessert.  It was ok, Nice presentation, but just not to my taste (sure it would be for others who like that combo) Yes! I'd return for the food alone -  be prepared for lack-luster service and ask for a quieter corner."}
{"text":"Nice menu of lighter choices and also so hearty entrees. We had the shaved greens salad - great vinegarette! - and I had the grilled salmon, and they were happy to replace the potatoes with extra parsnips and veggies. Great dinner!"}
{"text":"Soco Kitchen and Bar inside Delta by Marriott Toronto is a pleasant surprise.  I don't usually frequent hotel's restaurants as I found most of them were overpriced and serving mediocre food. Since it was freezing cold with -20 windchill, We decided to stay in and give Soco a try, I even invited some of my friends to join us!  Beers selection is decent with some from local Ontario breweries. I found my cocktail Caramel Apple Mule ($14) was so so. But luckily all the food we ordered were a hit!  #youwannaeat Mac'N Cheese ($10) with BBQ Braised Beef ($10+$4) is a must order as it had won 2015+2016+2017 Toronto Mac and Cheese Best of Festival. It did not disappointed!   Charcuterie and Cheese ($24) love the home made terrine and crackers! A nice spread to share with friends!  Not Fried Calamari ($15) packed with flavour: savory and spicy. And it definitely tasted a lot better than it looks!!  Good food, reasonable priced right in this touristy area of TO. I now know where I would go for a night cap."}
{"text":"Soco is a brand new restaurant that is located on the first floor of the Delta Hotel. My friend and I happened to be in the area on New Year's Day, so we decided to try this place out for dinner. It was not very busy that evening, maybe because it was new/still relatively unknown, or maybe because most people were home nursing their hangovers from the night before or spending time with family. When we arrived, I first noticed that the place had a very distinct, woody/fresh paint kind of smell, since it really is still quite new.  They have a pretty small, moderately priced dinner menu, but there were a number of dishes that caught my eye. That night however, both my friend and I ended up ordering the same thing and both got the duck confit. The description on the menu said it came with root vegetables, duck sausage, fregola sarda pasta (looks kind of like couscous/risotto), and preserved plum. When our dinners actually arrived, the duck turned out to be just a regular duck leg rather than \"duck sausage.\" Overall though, the dish was good. The duck meat was very soft, moist and juicy, and it was very interesting to eat with the slightly sweet/sour/tarte flavour of the thinly sliced plum. I also liked the pasta, as it was my first time trying it. It had a slightly doughier texture than couscous/risotto. Apparently it is supposed to have a sort of nutty flavour, but I couldn't really taste that because of the sauce in the dish. While I enjoyed the dish overall, I did find that it started to get a bit too salty during the last few bites. I still recommend trying it though, as it was quite good for the price of $23.  Out of curiosity, my friend and I also decided to take a look at their dessert menu, and I was so tempted by their desserts that I broke my new year's resolution on the first day of the new year and decided try one (I do it for Yelp, guys!) I got the pumpkin walnut cheesecake which was made with maple sour cream, blackberry preserve, and of course, walnuts. The cheesecake came out in a little dome shape and was presented very nicely. I think I was expecting a bit more variety in the flavours, what with the maple and the pumpkin, but I mostly just tasted pumpkin. It was quite good for a cheesecake, although there was this weird kind of gelatinous coating over the cake, so I wasn't a huge fan of that.  For me, Soco was a hit, and I would definitely return to try their other menu items. It's got kind of a cool atmosphere, and would be a good place to come for after-work drinks, lunch/dinner with friends, or even a casual date. It's dimly lit but the bar area is bright and colourful and they played fairly upbeat music while we were there. Definitely a cool, trendy kind of place to check out!"}
{"text":"SOCO is located inside the Delta Hotel on the ground floor. It has an open kitchen near both entrances which is pretty neat!! Love the idea of it. Nothing is hidden.   Seating down, I (by chance) picked up a Delta card near the salt and pepper and it was a hand-written card wishing me Happy Birthday. It certainly was a surprise as my friend made the reservation and I showed up before her. I was happy that they have put in the effort to do that - that's customer service!!   Happy:  The waiter was very nice, helpful and all smile. I ordered the lobster pasta dish which was made with homemade pasta (my fav.) The sauce was creamy and it actually had large lobster pieces. The portion was a good size. However, the creamy sauce did get to me once it was cold. So finish it quickly.   My friend got the same sandwich she ordered last time as this is her third time there. The fries are crispy and hot.   We got 2 desserts to try out; one is on the house since it was my birthday which was a nice treat. We got the creme brulee and the coconut flavoured ice cream on top of a cracker. It was displayed with finesse.   Verdict:  I would certainly go back for the desserts!!!! As for the dishes, I would try the duck confit. However, I find some entrees' prices high. The atmosphere is welcoming and it makes you feel like you are on vacation - probably because it's inside the Delta."}
{"text":"Soco Kitchen and Bar is a small restaurant with a sports bar feel on the ground floor of the Delta hotel in the Toronto financial district. I've been here a few times now, half for business lunches and half on my own. I've always found it easy to get a table for one or a group of four. For larger groups, it's best to call ahead to reserve.  My first visit was a team lunch the past summer. I had a black cod dish that I thought would be similar to what you'd get at a Japanese restaurant. It was not. I was also disappointed with the flavor.  Recently, I decided to give Soco another try because it was freezing outside and I didn't want food court food. I was interested in pasta, so I ordered the duck bolognese. It was fantastic, and I ordered it again on repeat visits. You can taste that the pappardelle pasta is freshly made. The ground duck is savory and delicious. I couldn't tell that it was duck. It includes a scoop of cold ricotta, which goes so well with the pasta. Getting a taste of ricotta, pasta, and ground duck in every bite is pure heaven.  On one of my last visits, I also ordered the mushroom soup. It had a very earthy flavor to it. At the bottom was a sliver of portobello mushroom and two quarters of a button or cremini mushroom. The soup is garnished with freshly ground black peppercorns. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Had the lamb chops and it was glorious!  The eggplant side was \"melt-in-your-mouth\" good.  Wife and kid had the mac and cheese which lived up to its award winning statement on the menu.  Great atmosphere and hard to believe it's not a 5 star rated restaurant!"}
{"text":"No. Just nope. Don't do it! The patio is beautiful and the manager was so friendly when we entered. But that's it. We didn't see the manager again! We went for Sunday brunch. The most watered down, pathetic Caesar I've EVER had. And the most expensive ($13). I ordered the lobster omelette. I swear, there was probably 1 cubic cm of lobster in there. Ridiculous. We paid over $80 for 3 of us and left starving!And we waited over 40 mins for the bill. You're much better off at E11ven down the road. Now that place is the same price, but boy is the food and service worth it. Unlike here. Ugh."}
{"text":"So the room was typical hotel trying to be cool, had the grilled calamari, and the shrimp tagliatelle - both very unique and well balanced. Enjoyed them a bunch.  Best part of the evening was the service from Kira and Julian at the bar.   Above and beyond, friendly and attentive.  The only reason they didn't get a 5 was didn't have enough of a sample size on the food."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Environment: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Overall: 4/5 What I like: fries here tastes awesome. The portion is good.  I came here for my team lunch. This is definitely a fancy restaurant located inside Delta hotel.  It definitely has a good environment and atmosphere. My coworker highly recommended the fries here, which is very good. The fries here has fired crispy garlic as seasoning. The menu item costs about $20 for lunch. I ordered hanger steak, which is around $26, in my opinion, it is a bit dry. It is very well seasoned, but it tastes more like beef brisket rather than steak. The portion here is good. My co-worker ordered chicken and it is literally half of a chicken which he could not finish. I would recommend this place for a business gathering since it is right at the center of the financial district."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with coworkers. The service was great, and the food even better! I ordered the Soco burger with a side of their famous Mac and cheese. Make sure you get this, it's delicious! I think it was an extra $4 to switch, but so worth it. Burger was on point! Ground up prime rib Chuck was so juicy. I didn't realize it was a double patty burger...so make sure you bring your appetite!  Definitely coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time before the Raptors game. Passed by a lot, never been inside.   To start we ordered the Arancini and award winning Mac n Cheese. The Arancini had mushrooms and melted cheese inside, with a crisp outer shell. They were delicious, 4 for $10. The mac n cheese, also delicious, made with fresh delicious cheese and a special blend of herbs was only $5 for a small bowl, easily shared between two people.   For the mains we kept it simple. Got the SOCO burger, which has smoked bacon and a delicious jam type ketchup. Paired with skinny fries (comparable to McDonalds cut, sans all the sodium). They came with a garlic, caper aioli dipping sauce to die for! Def worth a try.   The burger itself was very fresh, made from minced meat, perhaps hand made? It would crumble as I was eating it. Came on a light fluffy brioche bun, which kept things light. I wasn't taking the belt off for this meal.   Truly delicious comfort food here. Enjoyed my first visit here a lot. Will def be back for more. Amazing location for grub if you're in the area."}
{"text":"31 min waiting for a pint of Sapporo! People came in much later then our group and were served right away. Asked a manager where our drinks were and he never came back to our table.   Won't go back."}
{"text":"Not a large menu, but they have some nice food.  Attached to the Delta hotel, this restaurant has a beautiful interior and a nice patio.  They have delicious caesars - seems like there is cumin in the rimmer to add a nice touch.  We had the oysters and the charcuterie plate which were a nice snack.   The server forgot to give us the discount on the oysters however, and we also forgot as we walked out."}
{"text":"I had a signature cocktail \"Island Time\" (10/10) followed by a really fantastic Duck Confit (10/10) and finished my meal with an espresso (10/10). Cost me 54$ plus tip. Really good food and I plan to go there again.   I was a tourist from San Francisco, I was just strolling around in my summer sandals when I found this place, they were gracious and let me in.  I felt very out of place as everyone was dressed charming, the ambience felt rich and elegant. So I give extra credit to this place for treating me nicely. If you plan to go here for dinner, please dress a little nicely."}
