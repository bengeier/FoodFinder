{"text":"As a self-proclaimed beer snob, we were in Toronto to check out the beer scene. Hungry, we finally arrived to Indie Ale House. To our dismay, the kitchen was closed from 3 to 5 pm; however, the greeter suggested Playa Cabana Cantina across the street for some good eats. What a suggestion that turned out to be.

The prices were a little higher for a typical burrito, but in my opinion, I got what I paid for. I ordered the CARNE MOLIDA PICADILLO BURRITO which is home-ground beef slow-cooked with guajillo-ancho-chipotle. The burrito had a beautiful presentation with green ancho-chili sauce poured on one half with a red, tomatoe sauce poured on the other half. Their sauces were fantastic. They also offered two house-made hot sauces. One was a habenero based hot sauce and the other was a hot sauce made from smoked chilis. Both sauces had a great spice. The smoked hot sauce went great with my dish.

My wife bought the Tres taco option - ANCHO BRAISED SHORTRIB-BRISKET CRISPY TACOS. This took traditional tacos to another level. As mentioned, Playa Cabana has their sauces down. The liquid in which they braised the short rib was no exception. This option paired extremely well with the habenero hot sauce.

If you are in the area and have no problem with $14-18 for a delicious entre, by all means, try it out. (Not to mention Indie Ale House is right across the street with tastey brews for a good night cap.) When in Toronto again, I will defintely come back."}
{"text":"When eating tacos, I like to have a good hot sauce on the side. Cantina definitely delivered in this respect. On the table, there are two hot sauces, the red one, chipotle based, and the green one, SPICY! 

We ordered the octopus taco, fish taco and the LA truck taco. The combination of flavors worked very well. Each was enjoyable but the octopus was particularly good. I'm not sure how they cook it, but it was soft and flavorful. We also have the ceveche and plated chorizo burrito. The ceveche was not what I expected; I could have used some more salt and lime. The burrito was quite good, and unique. It had a fried egg on top, along with many sauces. 

The reason for 3-star rating is mainly because of the price. With so many other fusion taco places around now, changing $5+ for a taco seems to be a bit steep."}
{"text":"Playa Cabana Cantina is the latest restaurant to open in Toronto to fuel our newfound taco addiction in the city. It's located in The Junction at 2883 Dundas St. West (at Keele).

Playa Cabana Cantina is the second location for Playa Cabana - with it's first location on Dupont (at Davenport). The Junction has accepted it well, considering there were absolutely no reservations available for the whole weekend - but they assured me that they keep the bar open for walk ins.

So we walked in. Right away I was impressed by the decor, there's plenty of neon-lit signs including a shout out to JUNCTION - WEST TORONTO, and an \"Keep and Enforce Prohibition\" sign at the bar - perhaps a little tongue in cheek reference to The Junction's past as a dry neighbourhood until 2000.

The menu here is set up a little differently than other taco favourites like Grand Electric or La Carnita. Instead of ordering tapas style - one taco at a time, Playa Cantina's menu includes everything from tacos and tostados to burritos and enchiladas along with a side of rice and black or pinto beans.

We started off the meal with guacamole and chips. The chips arrived warm to the table and were extra crispy and fresh. The guacamole was smooth and not too spicy for our tastes. The bartender replenished the chips free of charge too, which is a great touch.

Playa Cabana Cantina has a fresh oyster bar set up, and at $2 a shuck, we couldn't resist them. They were huge, no skimping here, and were served with horseradish and hot sauce. Then, we each ordered a set of tacos with a side of rice and black beans, after starting off with Amber Agave Margaritas.

The Ancho Braised Shortrib-Brisket Crispy Tacos were served on a corn tortilla with melted cheese, sour cream and pico de gallo. They came to the table piping hot, and the mix of brisket and cheese was perfect along with the extra crispy tortilla. They were reasonably priced at $14 for an entree.

Next up was the Tacos de Pescado (Baja-Style fish tacos) for $13 . They were a little underwhelming in comparison. The breaded tilapia didn't have the substance to stand up to the guacamole and shredded cabbage filling. Usually I'm a big fan of a good fish taco but this wasn't the best I've had lately.

Personally, I prefer picking and choosing different tacos to try instead of ordering them as a personal entree. The sides of yellow rice and beans were fresh and a great addition, but it would have been great to try a few different kinds of tacos instead of three of one kind.

With another round of drinks coming, we felt the need for some dessert... Unsure of what to get, the bartender recommended the Mexican Flan, so we gave it a shot. After waiting a little longer than necessary (I think the kitchen forgot about us), our bartender arrived with the flan, which was actually 2 mini flan served with whipped cream. He apologized for the delay and said the dessert was on the house.
Overall the personal service at the bar was great, the bartender gave us a lot of recommendations on what to order and was more than helpful. The atmosphere was comfortable and casual, it didn't have that 'too cool' vibe that many new restaurants are picking up on now.

We definitely will be returning to try out the burritos and other menu items along with the amazing guacamole again too. The tacos were flavourful, with fresh, house made ingredients but not the best of what the city has to offer right now."}
{"text":"I can honestly say I've never been a fan of Mexican food so when my husband told me we were going here for dinner, I was not looking forward to it one bit.  Well...I'm completely converted and have been a few times now.  

The food is really tasty (although I, like another, reviewer liked their old menu better for sharing and getting to taste more things).

the customer experience was outstanding each time I went and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Tried the plated vegetarian taco, corn, fish tacos and the house made cream soda. The fish tacos were really tasty. They were a fried white fish with a slaw on top and some creamy guac. The corn I highly recommend it's done in a sauce and sprinkled with cheese. Plated tacos had a bit too many beans for me but the sauce on top and guac tasted great. Recommend starting with guac and chips. Try their tequilas if you drink."}
{"text":"My date and I went here for dinner and drinks saturday night. 

Almost impossible to get a table past 7pm, but they were able to seat us at the bar. It was nice to watch the bartenders make their drinks. 

I got a white sangria with a shot of tequila. Very tasty and dangerous :/ 

I ordered 3 tacos with short braised ribs. Delicious, savoury meat done right. My date got the vegetarian enchiladas. 

Unlike other places, these guys do not skimp on the guacamole. Both our meals came with a healthy topping of guacamole, which I loved. 

If your not picky about seating, definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I went in for a drink on a hot Sunday afternoon and I really enjoyed this place! I first noticed it during the Junction Solstice festival but it was too full to find a seat so I went this past weekend... and I loved it! Yes, the prices are definitely on the higher side but I enjoyed every item I had - both drinks and food - were done well. 

I have to rave about my drink - MICHELADA - if you like caesar's you have to try it. It was spicy, savoury and refreshing. The guac and chips were fresh and delicious. The tacos were fantastic... I felt they were a little overpriced but to be honest it was a reasonable price for Toronto... so I'm reluctant to complain. I tried the ANCHO-BRAISED SHORTRIB - absolutely delicious and they weren't shy with the spiciness which made me love it more.

Definitely worth a try if you haven't been already. Remember - Michelada... you have to try it."}
{"text":"Popped in on a Friday night without a reservation.  6:30 and the placed was packed.  We grabbed a seat at the bar, had a drink and Guac and chips, very good.  We shared the Barrito Street Style.  This was more than enough for two people to share.
The food was good, the wait staff attentive.  I am looking forward to making a reservation and enjoying a full meal next time.  I did find it a little pricey, but it is an interesting fun place."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre and the food was just the same, very small portions for the prices ($16.00 for 3 small fish tacos, no sides included). 

We had to wait about 10 - 15 minutes before our drink order was taken and the kicker of the whole evening was when my friend ordered a cappuccino and they served it with salt. We brought it to the server(s) attention and only a small apology was given and a replacement cappuccino, but then they continued to charge her for it on the bill. Lack in customer service! 

My rule of thumb and most restaurants I've ever been to, is that if you screw up on something, you replace the item and DO NOT charge the customer. Thanks for that mouthful of salt! 

That's the lasting impression this place left with us! And the server had the nerve to be pissy when he didn't receive a fabulous tip, he's lucky he got anything at all!"}
{"text":"The Junction's \"hipper\" Mexican restaurant, we've been a number of times, and they've been hit and miss.  Tacos are good, though pretty pricey for tacos.  And had a salad there once which was really heavily dressed.  Generally though, the food is nice and fresh, and the margaritas are great.  

Wait staff is inconsistent.  Two times where drinks came finally when we were half done our meal, and they seemed inconvenienced when they took orders, but other times the service was fine.

Reservations are a must, and I wouldn't recommend bringing kids here as this is more of a bar than a restaurant."}
{"text":"We visited the restaurant for the first time with our friends on Saturday. They had been there before and recommended it. The overall experience was ok, and food was the best part.

The place is way too loud: it was packed and the music was very loud. I did not hear a thing what the waitress said about the tacos that she served. I event felt that it was too embarrassing to ask what it is for the third time. The tables were quite small but we still had to shout to our friends on the other side.

We had to ask several times when are we going to get the tacos we ordered. Our friends had already finished their meal when we got the last tacos. The waiters did not seem to know what we were having either and there was a lot of confusion.

I found our waiter a bit arrogant too. Actually one of the rudest that I've met in Toronto. We just paid 160 dollars, you don't have to be rude to us, okay.

And what is the point of playing the music so loud?"}
{"text":"Playa Cabana Cantina was packed when we went for dinner. The food was good, even borderline great because it's difficult to find authentic Mexican food in Toronto. I recommend the chicken tinga which is a chipotle and tomato based pulled chicken dish served in tacos, enchiladas or a burrito. The tortillas used for the tacos had been fried so they were a little bit crispy which was nice. 

The service was passable but we certainly didn't feel like they were happy to have us in their restaurant. Normally I would expect recommendations of which dishes are popular and daily specials. Our server made us feel like she was doing us a favour by serving us as she didn't think to come and ask us how our food was until we were almost done, then we had to flag her down to order more food. We were not offered hot sauce and figured they probably didn't have any until we saw some on other tables as we were leaving. Granted, they were quite busy. 

Prices were a bit high for what they serve and the portion sizes however I think they're mostly justified given the quality and taste of the food - except for the dessert. We paid $10 for a pastel tres leches which was little more than a small slice of glorified pound cake with a scoop of ice cream. I lived in Mexico City for five years and am familiar with what a good pastel tres leches should be. This was not it. Perhaps we should have tried the churros poutine which looked great. 

I would definitely go back to Playa Cabana Cantina, perhaps for lunch instead of dinner to enjoy a less hectic atmosphere. The food was enjoyable and I'd like to try more of their menu. With better service I would feel more comfortable paying these prices for tacos."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have eaten here many times and the food, drinks and atmosphere have never disappointed. It's one of my favourite places to take friends visiting the city because it combines delicious food with a fun, bustling atmosphere and amazing decor. Favourite dishes include the guac and pollo tinga (chicken) tacos. Reservations are a must on most nights - weekday or weekend.

The reason for my review today deals with a pretty terrible recent take-out experience. I placed the order over the phone and was told it would be a 30-45 minute wait. We arrived 45 minutes later and were given the wrong order. I noticed it immediately since the receipt didn't reflect what we ordered, and the staff apologized. We waited another 15 minutes or so before being given our food. When we got home with it, we realized one entree was missing (a burrito.) I called and the staff member immediately knew who I was, and since they don't deliver, we had to head back to the restaurant to get the rest of the order. 

When we returned, I thought we'd be handed the missing box and be on our way, but we waited another 20 minutes. I'm not clear on whether they remade the burrito or hadn't made it in the first place, but the extra wait was unfortunate. They threw in some churros for this inconvenience and also offered us drinks, which was nice even though we didn't accept. 

When we got back home the second time, we opened the burrito box to find three tacos - not what we ordered, even though the receipt correctly reflected what we ordered. Even though we decided not to return to the restaurant a third time, I called to discuss the situation with the manager and was offered a free dinner next time I'm in the restaurant.

This situation was handled by the staff very well, but it was still very unfortunate. We ordered the take out at 7:15 p.m. and weren't eating until 9:30 p.m. It was way too heavy a meal for that late at night and while the food was delicious, the experience left a bad taste in our mouths.

My advice to anyone picking up take out from this location would be to check the order before leaving. It may be awkward to open up the boxes one by one to check each item, but it may save you a lot of time in the end."}
{"text":"The new slimmed down menu is no where close to as good as the original.  Service has consistently gotten worse over the past 3 months, I've been 5 times.  Food is inconsistent and rarely the same, and they seem to have stated to purchased outside ingredients instead of making them onsite, BIG DIFFERENCE.  

Time to find another place to eat, this has clearly become a cash grab for the owners, sadly things have gone downhill as popularity has increased."}
{"text":"Very average establishment, especially late night.  I was here on a Saturday night and tried to order the late night tacos that are advertised on the wall but the kitchen was closed.  Fortunately the servers were very apologetic and kind and the michelada was nice and spicy."}
{"text":"This past Saturday I had a party of 13 for 9pm.  I was a little concerned when first arriving as there was only 1 server for our table and I was worried it may affect our service time.  But I was hella wrong.  My entire party was thrilled with the food selection and drink selection.  The prices were right on par for a small group of varying income levels.  The atmosphere was fabulous for a party and everyone said they would be going back at a later date.  The food was filling and delicious.
Can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"Walking in, I thought my wildest taco dreams were coming true, as the decor was gorgeous. That was the only pleasant part of our visit.

Unfortunately it took 15 minutes to be acknowledged after we were seated. Then took an hour for the server to realize we have not received our food. 

The manager lacked sympathy when an apology was appropriate. Service was horrendous and unforgivable. 

Spoiler alert: we left the restaurant, an hour and a half after being seated, without being fed. However, we were billed for the two beers that miraculously made it to our table. Thanks manager. 


There are other delicious Mexican restaurants in Toronto. La Carnita is my personal favourite."}
{"text":"Great spot!
Packed every night, every day and for good reason. 
Beef tacos area to die for as are their fresh made guacamole and salsa. 
Staff is great and owner is very friendly and takes time to talk to clients. 
Love it!"}
{"text":"I went in with two friends in the middle of the afternoon to catch up after all having been away/busy for a few weeks. In the middle of a workday, it's understandable that it's a little slow. Our server seemed totally miserable that she was at work; not quite sure what that was about, she was fine, just not very engaging. It took quite a bit of time to get some chips with salsa (which was great) and guacamole.

We ordered a pitcher of mojitos, which while one of my favourite drinks (when mixed correctly) was horrible. I actually had to take antacids after (and I'm not one to have this issue!)

The menu wasn't huge (but I guess this keeps in the cantina style) and the menu specifies no additions or substitutions. I ordered the chicken taco salad option (the one \"sub\" you're allowed to make instead of having it in the shell) and it was DELICIOUS! perfectly spiced and shredded, wrapped in lettuce. Amazing. 

Next time, I'll order my food to go!"}
{"text":"atmosphere is slightly cramped but cool. Drinks are great and tasty. Food :. I find some things I am in love with like cannot get enough and others are good but not great. I like spicy but this place is extremely hot which I like. The only thing I would say is the portions are kind of small. I am a vegetarian and I find I need to order a main and a couple of tacos to feel satisfied. Maybe the meat dishes have more weight to them. They are really accommodating here. Both times I have been we showed up last min and they found us a table."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner tonight (Friday). Service was good, drink and appetizer orders were taken within four minutes and our server was knowledgeable about the menu.

The guacamole and nachos were very tasty, as was the house hot sauce, spicy but not overwhelming.

I had the LA Taco Truck and the Al Pastor. I would say that Seven Lives is definitely a step above in terms of quality, flavour and freshness, but the Catina's tacos were solid. My wife had the octopus taco and the scallop, she was very happy with both.

We shared the Churros Poutine, holy f***balls this was good. Deep-fried, salty, sugary, brain pleasure centre overload. Basically food crack."}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican food in Toronto!

Ordered the Guac to start which was very good. Had the chicken burrito which was very good. I had the original style which is basically an enchilada. If you want a burrito that you can eat with your hands get the street style burrito. Others had tacos which were also very good. Overall the service was good and drinks were also good except the small beer menu."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time and it was so good that you know what, if the owner asked me to punch myself in the face I would nod emphatically and deck myself square in the nose. 

The guacamole was awesome, chips were great, and service was very friendly (yep, they push drinks on you but whatever, welcome to life eating out at a restaurant). I didn't have any of the cocktails but they looked really great, if a little pricey ($11/$12 on average).

The only slight downside to the meal was my entree (vegetarian carnitas enchilada) came with meat in it. Pork, I think. But the food runner was very nice and apologetic when we let him know and a new one was out in just a few minutes. That's something I wouldn't personally knock a star off for because it was a simple mistake - probably made because it's a little loud in there and our waitress may have misheard, who knows - with a simple fix. Human beings make mistakes, no one died, everything is fiiiiiiiiine!

Everything was so good I wish I had room for more, but the portion size was so generous (more than I needed for sure but it's Cheat Day) and there was just no space left inside my body. 

Next time I plan to go a little lighter so I can try more of the menu.

A+ Do recommend."}
{"text":"I had never ventured out too far west of Landsdowne in the city until last weekend after reading a review of what looked to be a tasty Mexican restaurant in my Toronto Life magazine. Speaking as an amateur Mexican food connoisseur, I have found it difficult to find authentic and delicious Mexican cuisine at an equally trendy venue in Toronto. I mean you have your Mucho Burritos, but there's something about the replication of chain restaurants that I really detest.

Although there are three locations, Playa Cabana is far from a chain: the original location on Dupont has welcomed its sister restaurant, Hacienda, down the street and Cantina on Dundas West attracts a more playful crowd than the others. The original Playa Cabana arguably remains the most popular as it tends to be booked up to three weeks in advance.

When we arrived we were told there was room at the bar, which was cramped and situated in perhaps one of the worst places in the venue, serving both as a walkway between two seating areas and a busy spot to eat. The boisterous atmosphere made us feel more at home, however, as as we squeezed onto the bar stools and started going over the drink menu.

There was a good selection of several tequilas at Playa Cabana Cantina, mostly ranging from $6 to $16 with some more expensive vintage liquors, many of the rare bottles on display behind the bar. Featured cocktails included grapefruit-infused margaritas ($9) and classic mojitos ($10) alongside Mexican beer  while many of the non-alcoholic drinks were also authentic: Mexican sodas for $3.50.

The neon lights and grungy decor added volumes to the atmosphere, and the open kitchen in the back featured a playful staff who could be caught dancing to the upbeat reggae and salsa music. Meal prices were pretty standard, ranging from $5 individual tacos to a $24 rib-eye steak served alongside a poblano chile pepper and fresh corn tortillas. All of the Playa Cabana locations pride themselves on fresh ingredients, stating that nothing comes from a bottle or can, and that almost all of the food is locally sourced.

The rotisserie-style, slow cooked chipotle chicken enchilada ($15) paired beautifully with guacamole, sour cream and homemade salsa, while traditional sides of refried black beans and rice rounded out the meal nicely. A cause for concern were the pinto beans re-seared in homemade pork stock-mentioned on the website but not the menu-which may be a concern for vegetarians or those who don't eat red meat. The burrito selection is also poor considering the number and variety of tacos. Of the four burritos on the menu, the street style ($12) come in large portions and the medley of flavours do not disappoint.

Overall, Cantina is a trip worth making. The staff are friendly and attentive, the food is great, and if the neon lights and Mexican decor doesn't convince you that you are in Mexico the tequila certainly helps!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Services is good. Drinks are pricey.

Continually make reservations the night before, but each time, we still end up waiting 20-30 mins for our seats.
Other than that... the food is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Food is hit and miss. Drinks are good but expensive without much of a return. Service is chronically bad. What I mean by bad is unapologetic and unaccommodating."}
{"text":"My family loves this place.  It's walking distance from our house so my husband and I can enjoy a couple pints of their most excellent cerveza when we go.  Everything is high quality delicious.  The place is super busy so book a table ahead.  My only complaint, and the only reason I could only give 3 stars is that they took my favorite entre off the menu.  We were huge fans of the enmoladas (enchiladas with mole sauce).  Sadly they are no more.  I see that they still make them at the dupont location though.  Will have to try them there.  This place is fun, loud, busy, a little expensive, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"Tried ordering from each of the chains via UberEats and the app allows me to note allergy requests.  The restaurant cancels the order without explanation, on 3 seperate occasions) when I tried to call both Hacienda (2 times) and Cantina, the staff are unwilling to make any changes to the dish. I eat at these restaurants in person regularly, and can make the same substitutions. I get attitude from both --- andddd taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here again, without a reservation and we were able to sit at the bar. Since I didn't love my taco selection last time, I asked the bartender what she would recommend. I ordered the braised short rib crispy tacos based on her suggestion and they were ridiculously flavourful and delicious.  My friend had the fish tacos, and i swapped one of hers for mine and i found them to be  still just alright.  Much smaller and less hearty than the short rib. 
Pretty slow service, but they definitely don't rush you out."}
{"text":"biggest disappointment in canada so far. this is not mexican food, nor style, nor taste!

My tacos didn't even come with tortilla but with some cheap greasy chips like substance. Also the actual chips that came with the guacamole were much too greasy and rancid in taste. Felt horrible afterwards!!! 

On top of it all, the food was as spicy as a bottle of milk. Real mexican food has to burn twice!!!

I have given up on wannabe mexican places in Toronto, yet another scam."}
{"text":"My absolute fav place in this neighborhood. I take everyone here. The margaritas are divine. Everything is delicious. My fav tacos are the lobster taco and the corn/pablano(sp?) crispy taco. The guac is alway fresh. The corn is fantastic not to mention everything else on the menu. Love this place."}
{"text":"My favourite place for Tacos, been many times now and never disappointed. Make sure to try the Dave's Margarita."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is amazing! I love the steak burritos and their guacamole is to die for! The service is fantastic! I seem to get the same waiter, always pleasant and fast! It's very loud so not a place for a romantic dinner. I love going here with a bunch of girlfriends to catch up!"}
{"text":"busy and with a good vibe.

would have like an option to order three different tacos rather than all the same but understand. We just ordered three different groups of three tacos and shared the plates. The shrimp tacos stood out from our selection.

The appetizer guac was OK, but not worth the $9."}

{"text":"Good Mexican food and selection of tequilas. Had some bizarre issues with how they serve customers and the unapologetic tone. Have had my bill wrong every time."}
{"text":"The food is good. However, the old menu was significantly better. The new menu is a lot less interesting (more deep fried and easy). The prices, unfortunately, are still very high. 

That said, it is definitely a fun place. If you can afford it, the drinks are great. 

The reason I've rated it a two is the service. It is not good. Last time I went I made a reservation almost one month in advance (I had some family visiting). We arrived on time. We were told that they were \"just clearing our table\" and were asked to take a seat at the bar. We sat at that bar for at least one hour waiting to be seated. I understand they are doing multiple seatings, and sometimes people are just pokey, but they could have told us the truth. When we finally were seated the servers were not apologetic at all, and we really had to work to flag them down for a refill. The whole experience was very negative. 

Next time I'll save some money and go to Revolucion!"}
{"text":"Just keep in mind THIS IS NOT MEXICAN FOOD, people who dont know mexican food would like it which is fine, food is not terrible. I just cant understand why to push the mexican label when is not even.... What they do is to take a mexican dish and do an american version of it. It is a expensive place also for the portions.... It is just \"trendy\" so keep in mind you need reservation to eat here everytime."}
{"text":"Great addition to the Junction strip.  Love the decor, it's fun.  Though always sit at the front because the high tables near the back are less comfortable.  Great selection of tacos.  Especially great selection of margaritas that are well made.  Do not skip the churros for dessert, they are excellent and authentic."}
{"text":"Playa Cabana is the best Mexican in Toronto. 

However delicious and satisfying, this location seems to fall a bit short compared to the Playa Cabana on Dupont st.

Still highly recommended."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu here is excellent! Tacos, burritos, main entrees, you name it. I come here quite often and always enjoy myself. All the food menus are reasonably priced, I usually split the guacamole with friends and order 3 tacos. The only small downfall would be the drinks menu- I find this to be very expensive. While their signature margarita is very good, it comes in a small tumbler served with lots of ice- not worth the money for over $10bucks a drink.

{"text":"I'm giving Playa 5 stars because, on Dundas in the Junction, this really is as good as it gets. But my 5-stars is mostly for atmosphere. It's electric! Everytime I go in there! I just love being there. People are always having the best time and it just makes you feel good. We had a very worldly guest visiting from out of town once and we took him to Playa and it really gave him a great impression of our neighbourhood.

The food is good. Everything is a bit spicy for my taste, no matter what you order (I really don't like a lot of spice) but I've been there with several other people and everyone loves the food.

I actually prefer their drinks over their food. I've had a few of their (daily special) cocktails and they are ALWAYS yummy. I once had a lavender-infused cocktail there and it was sooo good, it sent me into a lavender-infusing tailspin for weeks, trying to recreate the drink. 

And I've always found the staff to be very good and very knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday for my B'day with some friends.  
Four of the six of us were running late for the 5.30pm reservation and I was worried they would give our table away, but I called to advise this and they were kind enough to give us another 15 min.

Food was fantastic from start to finish.  Great chips and salsa, I think we tried every Taco on the menu, maybe a few times.  Favorites were the breaded fish, pulled pork, short ribs and oxtail although all were so good.  We also tried the shrimp bucket and be warned its quite spicy.  

Margaritas were amazing, cant remember which one we had but it was recommended by our fabulous waiter - great service the whole night.

Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because we were \"kindly\" asked to leave by the lovely door bitch due to overstaying our allotted time limit for the reservation.
I can understand if we had actually stopped ordering and were just chatting but hey we had just taken our final bites of the last round of tacos and were still planning on ordering dessert and plenty more drinks.  Our waiter bought us a round of tequilas on the house with the bill to say he was sorry which went down well.

Would definitely recommend this place and will be trying their sister restaurant also.
great night out!"}
{"text":"Best guacamole ever! We were there on a Monday, which turned out to be \"sangria\" day. We were pleasantly surprised when we got our bill and it was half the price for our pitcher. Great spot! We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love their food. So good, honestly everything on the menu is sooo yummy. The seating can be a bit difficult at times, especially when its busy but, honestly the food is soo good. I've been here numerous times and i've never left disappointed. This is my go to Mexican spot. I love all the tacos, the guac, the burritos, the enchiladas, love the portions and beans, rice, everything is just so flavourful and what you would except from a Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was super fun and trendy. I loved the exposed brick and the narrow but long layout. I had beef tacos and they were amazing! I'm not a fan of margaritas but I sucked one back and it was super delicious. The only thing I would say is that the service was slow and not that attentive - but the restaurant was busy and lively so it was understandable and not that big of a issue! I will go back there!"}
{"text":"Service, service, service - these guys obviously didn't get the memo. Haven't been back for a while since each of our three times there we experienced terrible care by the serving staff. On one instance we were asked if we wanted a birthday dessert for our friend's birthday, thinking it might come with some birthday flair like singing or clapping, but the plate was dropped off in front of his empty seat while he was using the washroom. Surprise! FAIL. One another instance, after checking back two times and ensuring there would be enough room for the birthday party attendees and that they would have no issue with splitting the cheques by table, hearing from other bad experiences, they somehow had the reservation go missing when she called to say they would be five minutes late. Happy Birthday! FAIL again. My boyfriend and I went back once more, only to have our food forgotten about. Never ever again Cantina."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!! The tacos are full of flavour and are suprsingly filling for what might look a little small when it first arrives. I recommend that everyone tried the chips and guacamole, it is so fresh! 

The decor adds to the atmosphere, and the option to eat at the bar is great as it does get quite busy. I recommend trying to book ahead. 

Our waitress was quick to point out that they had full menu dedicated to tequila and was great in letting us know about tequila mixed drink specials that they offered.

Great spot to visit and in a great locaiton!"}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday evening for dinner, and they were booked with reservations for tables. That's a good sign for the food. Luckily, they have a fair amount of bar seating.

We ordered a starter of guacamole and salsa with tortilla chips. For meal, we got the Pescados (Fish) tacos, and the Kalbi Beef tacos. All of the food was fantastic.

Service was good, the staff were friendly. We plan to bring friends with us next time and call ahead for a table before we do."}
{"text":"Really delicious mexican food.  We ordered the flautas and chips/guac to start and both were very tasty.  We had a bunch of tacos and the favourite was definitely the shortrib or the lobster.  The octopus was delicious too, although pretty hot. I will definitely be returning.  The service was good too, and I was happy that they took reservations (although they do warn you that your seating time is for two hours max)."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. While the service was as good as expected, food was cold, dry and thrown together. Boo."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this. Loved the ambiance and decor.  But the food was a cut above food court fare.  Beef taco was dry and cold.  Burrito was congealed and cold.  It had potential, but not bringing it out in a timely fashion was a sin.  Charging for salsa and chips?  Come on.  

Getting out to this spot was a bit of a trek and I had hoped to get a good Mexican food experience.  It was more Tex/Mex much to my chagrin.

Prices were reasonable though.  If I lived/worked in the area.  I'd go by now and then.  Timing issues aside, the food quality was very good.  But it was not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Went here on Monday night, had one of the worst experiences dining out I have ever had, four of us. Went without a reservation, sat at the bar no problem ot took a good 30 mins to even get service. Ordered two draughts a bottle of beer and a coke. Another 15 mins or so and our waitress come back with a single bottle of beer no explanation and walks off. We grabbed her on the way by and asked where the draughts were and the coke and bottle of beer she said \"Oh we're out of draught and have been all night\" then we finally got the rest of our drinks like 10 mins later. We order all of our food comes out separately at different times and the wrong dishes come out a couple of times. There is also the issue of having food allergy and ordering my food without avocado, surprise it still had avocado. This was the worst dining experience I've had in Toronto. This was the 2nd and last time we will go there. They are overpriced surly and lazy. No explanations as to the horrible experience and nothing was done to rectify the situation when we brought it to the attn of the host. Create a nice memory and eat out of a dumpster instead."}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE: I like this place. I like all the PC outlets. The food was awesome as usual. And the service was decent especially considering we came in a half hour before the kitchen closed. Now with that being said my guest and I left slightly unhappy. 

We were drinking margaritas and each time we asked for another the bartender asked if we were okay with the same glass which was good with us. We still had drink left in each and when she poured us our new drinks  we noticed our glasses which were already partially full, were only now half filled. 
We let it go. 

Next round I get one and my guests says she's good. The bartender again adds to my already partially full drink and the drink even after being filled with ice doesn't come anywhere near full and the bartender decided to top off my guests drink which seemed really nice at the time because she said she didn't want any. 

Bill comes and we are charged for 4 drinks which made sense to us considering the bartender half filled each glass twice (one which wasn't ordered). The bartender then takes the bill back and adds 2 more drinks to it. So now we are charged for 6 drinks. In our eyes we were only served 4 by what we saw her pour and 5  if you take into account what we asked for.

Again, love PC. I'm just saying ask for a new glass and beware of what the bartender is doing. We left feeling a little scammed. I'll be back to PC again, just probably not this particular location. And I'll make sure to be more careful next time."}
{"text":"Playa Cabana Cantina was a hit! Having been to the one on Dupont, and not being a fan, I was pleasantly surprised at the Cantina, its sister location. Food was very tasty, lively, fun and very unpretentious atmosphere, and excellent service, thanks to our server Julian. I live 3 minutes away from the Playa Cabana on Dupont, but will drive to the Junction to eat at the Cantina. Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We've been here 2 hours. Very friendly staff, but SLOW service. Our order was messed up, one taco had a hair in it, and our waitress disappeared for 15-20 min at a time. She was lovely when she was here, but this food isn't good enough to make up for the slow service."}
{"text":"The service is always friendly, the food is delicious and the drinks are unique. Although it's pretty pricey I think it's worth it, the quality is great. I've ordered several dishes in the past and the only one I was disappointed with was the lobster ceviche (a special that day), it didn't have enough lobster in it. I have had a bass one there and it was much better. The lobster tacos were unbelievable though. Overall a great place to go in the junction if you're looking for something interesting."}
{"text":"Terrible service- our waitress forgot to punch in our order (table of 4) so we waited for over an hour and a half. When we politely asked how much longer we'd have to wait- the busser told us that \"we'd just changed the menu... so you'll have to be patient.\" our food came out plate by plate (taco by taco, side dish by side dish.. the rice and beans came after the tacos were already finished), and the same busser came back and told us that \"the food comes out as its ready so go ahead and dig in\" even though every single other table in the place had all of their tacos come out at the same time. 

overall just terrible service. food was cold by the time it got to us. felt totally disrespected. go to revolucion across the street."}
{"text":"WARNING: LA Truck Tacos are addictive.

This place is great and the tacos are top shelf. Only reason they don't get the bump to five stars is the price. Ugh. Guacamole is killer, stuffed pepper is great, drinks are excellent. Atmosphere is pretty good too."}
{"text":"Good food and service,  First time trying Mexican food. Will definitely come back and looking forward to trying the other Playa Cabana establishments."}
{"text":"Usualy enjoy this place to an extent. I guess I've never really sat down for a meal there. Today I brought my mother in for lunch. We got 3 tacos each for $15 and a couple of drinks. Thinking the bill would be around $35 or so before tax, I was surprised to see the bill was over $50! Why? Our waiter charged us for the guacamole he brought to our table, $9. We were also charged about $4 for ' homemade sour cream' which we never asked for. Now the waiter did ask my mom, when I was in the washroom \"do you want guacamole with your (complimentary) chips?\" She didn't know, she just said 'yes', assuming it was free....since she should've asked (should've been told!) if there was a charge,I'll give them that,...but the sour cream?? It's not the charge, it's the principal.  I'm not a fan of sneaky servers or the managers that condone them, being a server myself that doesn't rip off her customers, i know this guy was just looking to add more $ to the bill to get a bigger tip. We just took the excess charges out of his tip. When I asked him about the guacamole he was quick to point out the price is on the menu, therefore justifying his actions. He knows what he's doing, and he knows it's sneaky and wrong. So this guy just lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"Warning! this is not a food review. This is pure venting after going to Play Cabana Cantina and having feeling completely neglected from the beginning to the end. 

To start, we entered the place (half empty) and there was no one around to seat us. After waiting by the door for approximately 2 long minutes (already frustrated- it felt like forever), I walked in and asked waitress #1 if I could pick any table. She asked me to give her a minute (and looked at me as if I was bothering her). Then waitress #2 finally came, checked our reservation on the iPad, and showed us our table.

We did not have a drink menu on our table and that created another set of delays during the time we were in there as waitress #2 was too busy to come back and ask for our drink order.

We shared the corn dish (elotes a la parrilla) as appetizer. It was tasty but it could have been better if it was warmer and if we had received our drinks by then.

I had a Cuban mojito and wow, it took 10 minutes for them to deliver the drink but it was outstanding! Their margarita was equality tasty. It may took too long because it seemed that the bartender had to remake a pitcher for another table or maybe because waitress #2 took too long to get our drinks from the bar. Who knows?

For my main I had the burrito de mariscos, and the catch of the day was the tilapia. It was delicious but it felt more like an enchilada than a burrito (not a complaint just a remark- good food is good food even when they serve fish when I order pork). I tried the Poblano chillies with cheese, rice and beans and it was to die for. It was great to know that you can have a great vegetarian dish in their menu. Kudos for the chef!

I felt that the service was super slow and did not care about us and it ruined our dining experience. After waiting so much for our drinks I decided to time how long would take us to get our main (acceptable 12:34 minutes).

Oh, I almost forgot to mention what a struggle was to pay for the bill....the money could be on the table forever waiting for her to give us the change.

If I could provide a feedback to the owners of Playa Cabana Cantina, I would say, keep the chef, the cooks and the bartender. Get ride of your waitresses. They suck! They clearly don't care about your patrons. 

As I am able to provide a tip to 1000+ foodies in Toronto, I will say, get takeout from Play Cabana Cantina if you don't want to have poor service because the food is really good.

Now is out! Feels so much better :)"}
{"text":"Conspicuous lack of tequila in the margarita.  Really greasy (grease pouring out all over the place) short rib taco.  Waiter could not describe the fish in any way(it's like a fish finger in a taco). Sloppy and thoughtless. No quality check on anything.  Hostess made stink eye when we brought her attention to the above making a possibly forgivable bad experience unforgivable. Too bad. We are servers and usually generous and forgiving."}
{"text":"Terrible and grossly overpriced!  Like the Globe and Mail said \"Taco Bell for the jet set\"  the globe writer also caught the owner lying about sourcing everything locally when the Sysco truck pulled up in the middle of their interview. Ha!!"}
{"text":"I loved this place, the food was amazing and the service was pretty good. It was my first time tasting tacos and I feel quite satisfied. I don't have anything to compare it to considering that I haven't really tried Mexican food, but it definitely set the bar for when I try other Mexican restaurants around the GTA."}
{"text":"love the bar and the toonie tuesdays deal on tacos"}
{"text":"I can't understand why this place has so many good reviews. If want to hang out in a cool,trend,pretending to be in Mexico and spend lots of your money just go there. If you look for a great food definitely there is not the place. Its  not about the quality of the food but about how much you spend x how long you stay in this Mexico trend place. My seafood was completely overcooked. Im giving one star because the decoration is GREAT.  I assume the other locations are the same."}
{"text":"A close friend railed about how goof this place is and how it was the best Mexican he had ever tried.

It didn't quite live up to the hype.

The service was friendly and helpful and even offered us free oysters. The food was really good, but frankly i have have had better. At the end of the day its really good Mexican, but what separates this place from others that I have preferred in the past is a combination of better quality ingredients, better seasoning and better presentation.

Overall it is hands down the best in the area and Will likely be my go to Mexican place for the area, but there are places that do better."}
{"text":"So Disappointed.  The service was TERRIBLE.  My husband and I were ignored.  We were sitting next to a clock and it was literally 23 minutes before a server addressed us and took our drink order.  The servers were to busy singing and dancing to the crappy pop music to notice any of the customers.  Our server could not pronounce most of the items on the menu...  Only in Canada do you pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant.  You should never pay more than $2.50 for a taco.  I will have to get my Mexican food fix when I am back in the States.  Pretentious and overpriced.  This place makes a mockery of Mexican culture."}
{"text":"So the burrito was fantastic!!! and HUGE! I had the chorizo sausage one with a fried egg on it! 
The guacamole is super fresh and perfect with those hand-made taco chips. Definitely going to be a staple restaurant for me!"}
{"text":"I want to focus on the aspects of this restaurant: the food, service, and atmosphere.

Let me say the food is phenomenal and that's what keeps me going back. Very sophisticated flavours with an attitude like no other. The prices could be a little lower but still, this is the reason there are people lining up outside the venue on weekend. 5/5.

I really enjoy the people who work at Cantina as well. When I took my friends for late night drinks last Saturday, our waitor was entertainingly knowledgable of the food, what we should order, and was an expert on getting us to purchase multiple shots of tequila. The service was great, however it seemed like our waitor got caught up in attending to other tables and carrying on her welcoming ambience that she forgot to bring us one plate of food. This left us waiting a couple of minutes as the already brought food got cold. Leaving as well took a while. We asked for the bill a few times only to get told to wait a few minutes. 4/5.

Finally, the atmosphere is something I wanted to quickly touch upon. The restaurant is small so having the place filled can make the restaurant very loud. To add to that, the Spanish music blasting doesn't help the conversation flow either. Be aware that at times it can be hard to hear the person speaking as they sit beside you. 4/5.

Overall, I'd recommend Cantina if you're looking for a nice way to fancy-up quality time with friends or loved-ones. I'd seriously suggest giving it a try."}
{"text":"I think I would take this down to 3 stars. Good is tasty, but haven't felt great after eating there each time."}
{"text":"This place looks disgusting. I get the vibe they're trying to pass off but it totally fails, just down right gross looking.

The food they're trying to pass off as Mexican is really a sad excuse for it. I don't think mexican food should be overly expensive and small portions, unfortunately that's what you'll get here. 

The saving grace is that the service is quite good, won't make me try it agin though."}
{"text":"Liked it but not sure I would go back!

The food was interesting but the portions were small and the three tacos I tried all tasted the same :) The service, as others have said, is a little on the rude side and the waitress we had was trying to push up the bill, presumably expecting a bigger tip.

It was fun, we had a good time, it was loud but I'm kinda \"been there, done that!\" Nothing really makes me want to go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"We ordered two braised beef enchiladas and one chicken enchilada for delivery through Foodora. When the meals came, we were missing one and the other two were incomplete. I have been to the restaurant before and ordered the same thing - there was so much food I couldn't finish it. The food we received on delivery was small enough to eat for a snack. We called to ask about the order and waited on hold for about 5 minutes. They did offer to send another meal, but we were not interested in receiving another cold, small meal. We got our money back."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are perfect. Prices are perfect. However, coming into a feisty and growing community and having tables by reservation only on a Friday night (with no information given on how to make the reservation) is not the way to make good friends of neighbours. Especially when there are several other very hip and tasty bars and restaurants who have completely embraced the local scene. Something for the Cantina to think about, unless they want all their patrons to arrive and leave on the 40."}
{"text":"There's some places that you go to and you can't help but be like \"Damn! This is why 
Yelp exists!\", and I mean this in the best possible way! I'm half tempted to go see if I've rated anything else 5-star, and lower the review, because they likely don't compare. 

Clearly I'm not the first person to discover the Playa Cabana Cantina- I went on a Wednesday evening, and this place was PACKED, and for good reason! From the friendly staff, to the hip decor, to the inventive cocktail menu, to the delicious food - I've got nothing to gripe about, other than I didn't discover it sooner.

I'm a pretty big fan of Mexican-inspired dishes, and am definitely not difficult to please, but his place really raised the bar! Hands down, the best salsa I've ever had. As a vegetarian, I opted for the veggie enchiladas suizas and I was blown away by how flavourful the food was. No boring beans and rice here. Our server offered us some really excellent HOT sauces to accompany that even further enhanced the flavour (be prepared for some serious heat, boys and girls)!

Despite how busy it was, it was well staffed, and we were well attended to throughout our visit. The servers made us feel like old friends, and with the lively Spanish music, it's pretty hard to resist the tequila ;). 

I can imagine this place is off the hook for Cinco de Mayo!

I really can't rave enough about the Playa Cabana Cantina, and am already planning my next visit! There's a large menu that demands to be explored, and cocktails that demand to be sampled. Some people may find that it's a little on the pricey side (it's no Taco Bell), but you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I had high expectations, but they were quickly dashed:

1) the wine list is tiny - almost non-existent, and all the beers are mass produced; not a single micro brewery, only corn-based, beer-flavoured drinks. 

2) I ordered the tacos and the shells were deep-fried. Too much trans fat and no fresh items to balance the plate. The portions are small and no sides are included. 

There seems to be a decent concept here because the decor is cool and the atmosphere great, even on a Monday night, hence two stars. 

The menus is somewhat unimaginative and the place feels more like a corporate franchise than a local, neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had lunch here. The menu has items which contain gluten clearly marked, which was handy for me because I have celiac disease. The tortilla chips were fresh and their guacamole and salsa were delicious. We shared the braised short rib tacos, which were amazing. The service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was casual. Seems like a perfect place to share some drinks and appetizers. We'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Their hard taco shells are absolute perfection. My favourite is the short rib taco - you won't be disappointed, you have to order it! 

I will definitely be back to dine here again. It's on a small side but well worth any wait you may run into. My waiter was a gorgeous girl with a bald head - she's deserves recognition (not only for the fact that I had an embarrassingly intense crush on her) but because she was attentive without hovering or being too in-your-face, which is hard sometimes in a place that small. 

Overall, I loved all of the food (in total our table shared the fish tacos, chicken and rib) but the rib tacos with the hard shell are by far my favourite, and I can't wait to go back on the sole strength of them. 

Even thinking about them makes me want to go, right now."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. I'll give it my two stars because the tacos were tasty, the decor was top notch. I'd heard buzz before it opened....Here's the thing, the staff were completely unorganized, some even nauseating.  A little more interested in hmmmm, being hip? 

Sat at the oyster bar, didn't even get asked for drink orders for a good ten. Yet, there's five guys behind the bar (with a mean age of 22?) busy hive-fiving their pals sitting at the bar, texting, tweeting, whatever, instead of serving... A tad unprofessional boys. 

Next, bartender taking a shot with his pal (with subsequent high-five) steps out to bear-hug his buddy elbows my gf and knocks her purse to the floor. Yes, an accident, but not even an acknowledgment.... Was it the shots, kid? 

Asked about their beer on tap and the server says \"umm, I dunno what it's like; some Mexican beer?\"..... Really? 

Ordered an appetizer, as in, pre-dinner bite, which of course came 35 minutes after our order, with our meal; ouch. 

This is Mexican people, not beef bourguignon.   

Okay, it's new... I know it's tough working out the bugs in a new restaurant; and yes, its junction.... But management, there's more to hiring people with personality, experience, and professionalism than the number of tat's on ones forearms. 

I'm going to have to head a little further south for my tacos still, GE, style."}
{"text":"Went to the Junction location on a Sunday night around 7pm. We were seated promptly, but were not seen by a server for 20 minutes. When our server showed up, she asked if she could get us some drinks. I said 'how about drinks and food?' She said sure! She took our order of drinks, and turned her back. Not cool. 10 minutes later she was back with our drinks and we finally ordered our food. By Canadian standards, it was pretty good, but  it's still a far cry from what they have down south. Margarita's were very well done. Unfortunately, while waiting to order our second drink, our server, a bartender, and the receptionist were dancing in the corridor to Vanilla Ice. Again, not okay. The few interactions we had with our server, she smiled excessively and tried to be our best friends. If I came here to make friends, it might be cool, but this is a business - there was a lack of professionalism from the staff and it soured my experience. Service was baaaaaad.

Like I said -  food was decent, and drinks were very good.

Things that the restaurant can improve upon:

1. Stricter rules / training for the staff
2. Don't charge 5 bucks for chips and salsa, with choice of either green or red salsa; the ingredients are cheap, and you are gouging the patrons. Any reputable Mexican place has chips and salsa (red and green) on the table, about a minute or so after the guests are seated. And it's complimentary. Charge $3 or $4 for the Guacamole, that's reasonable. But not $8.
3. When I go to a Mexican joint, I want to hear Mexican music. Some Mariachi, or Vicente Fernandez would be preferable to Ice Ice Baby.

There are some good qualities in this place, and I see a lot of promise. But there has to be some progress before I can give it a higher rating."}
{"text":"Just came for the 4th time. I made the mistake of making a reservation at one of their other restaurants thinking it was this one. But they sat me anyways on a busy Saturday night. Excellent service.
I got their ceviche which is easily the best in the city, always so fresh. And 3 tacos, the carne asada, the spicy shrimp and the octopus. All three were amazing, but the shrimp was the stand out.
Each time I've been both the food and service are impeccable."}
{"text":"Mediocre service by a staff who are clearly of the opinion that what they do is beneath them. As others have pointed out, a bit of a barn. As to the food, underwhelming. It *may* be acceptable in a city lacking quality mid-range Mexican food but this outfit and its kin would last about three seconds south of the border. You'd be better off eschewing trendy little joints like this and seeking out better offerings from places like Mexitaco or, better yet, hopping a plane to Chicago and treating yourself to a meal at Topolobampo."}
{"text":"Loved the micheleda and the margherita drinks I had. The rib tacos were a big highlight.

Great atmosphere. They have a really huge space (good for big groups). 

Didn't love the chilly service, though. When entering we weren't smiled at, or greeted. I found the staff were more interested in chatting to each other than clearing our dishes or bringing us more drinks. Shame, because we would have spent more if they were more attentive.

Would I come back? Yes. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Playa and I was bringing friends because I really enjoyed my first visit. We were going to be attending another function that night so I actually made early reservations for the place just because I wanted to take them there.

A few hours before the reservation, I got a call to confirm that I was coming. Totally fine - it seems to be the norm for popular places.  However when I made the reservation almost a week and a half earlier I was never told that there would be a two hour limit for our spot.  I mean I understand....the reservation was for 5pm! I get it....the perception is that sub ewe won't be the types to go crazy on cocktails....which for those who read my reviews is obviously not true, but to tell me THE DAY OF, when I am handcuffed to make another reservation and have been already been giving the place props.....that is weak. Weak in fact like the drinks as the consensus went.

In any event, the food is awesome and very reasonably priced and that is the main attraction. I will be back, but will save grabbing drinks for some other much better spots nearby!"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch. Ordered the guac, salads and fresh made tortilla chips along with the best braised short rib brisket tacos! All gluten free and delicious"}
{"text":"Came here for my sisters birthday and will definitely be back again as it seems to be the less busiest of the chain. As well, it has a lot more space than the other locations so you don't feel like you're going to bump elbows with the table next to you. I love all of the Playa Cabanas and this one didn't disappoint. We all shared chips & guac, Mexican grilled corn, hard shell braised beef tacos, LA Truck tacos & some chipotle chicken tacos. I wish we had room for more as I would have loved to have tried some sort of fish tacos. I also had the Tijuana Mule - I could have drank 5 of them, similar to a Dark & Stormy (just didn't like the price - $16)."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Playa Cabana Cantina. My son and his girlfriend took me as they always rave about it. Sure enough, it was everything they said it was. Homemade, nicely prepared, great selections with top of the line ingredients. Atmosphere was great too. We were there early (5p) in Family day, so it wasn't that busy. By 6p it was almost packed. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant as I live in the area, but the service is lacking.   The food is top notch, but the two times I have been there (once on a Tuesday over dinner, and once on a Saturday afternoon ) the service has been horrible. Staff are friendly enough, but on both occasions the wait staff didn't even know who was supposed to serve us.  Tables on either side of ours,  who arrived after us, were served before us.

I'd love to see these guys succeed, but when they can't even serve us in a timely manner, the neighborhood may be better off without them."}
{"text":"Pretty yummy food, just wouldn't have preferred it to be so expensive (considering the portions.)   If they halved their menu prices I would be here every day."}
{"text":"OHAMAGAD. 

Delicious and crazy generous on the booze. 

Tried a few things and shamelessly vacuum-ed it all down to make room for the newly ordered things (the tables are sort of small). 

Awesome decor, friendly staff. Came here on a week night so it wasn't too bad to get a table.  

Make sure to call and make reservations as it gets busy. 
Guac (really yummy)
Flautas (think pulled bbq pork. You get 3 rolls and it's good to share but the steak was a bit dry imhp)
calamari - grilled, quite tough

Pollo Tinga - chkn taco (the best taco on the menu. AMazing!)
Acho-braised shortrib - not too bad but the tortilla wasn't warm 
La Truck Taco - kalbi beef, cooked very well but again the tortilla was cold
Chorizo Verde - mexican ground chorizo , delicious and addictive (my second fav Taco here)
Langosta - loster and coleslaw (had all the right ingredients but broke my heart. Definitely was the most disappointing. The tortilla was cold, the lobster was awful, the coleslaw didn't look mixed but more like a garnish - maybe it was a bad batch? 
home-made lemonade (by far my fav virgin lemonade)
Mexican Cola - love the coke in vintage glass bottles. A must try!

Very good place to hang with friends and be merry but I must say in terms of food grand electric is still my fav taco joint.

{"text":"A local favourite of ours for quite some time, Cantina does Mexican food right. The burritos are ginormous, the tacos are packed full of flavour and their nachos and guac are a must have. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because of our dessert. The churro poutine was definitely not up to their usual high standards of presentation and taste. What we got was a glass half filled with dolce de leche with 4 churros sticking out of it and a few mini marshmallows. The idea was great, but not the execution."}
{"text":"Went today for my first time. First the food was pretty good although a little on the greasy side. Everything was fresh and enjoyable. Our waitress was nice and explained our menu, we were new to Mexican food so this was helpful. 

The downfall to our lunch was our drinks. I ordered a pitcher of margaritas for $55 plus tax all together $62 plus a tip so I spent $70 on 3 glasses of margarita or should I say ice? There was barely anything to drink. The pitcher was full off ice and we get 3 small glasses in total out of it, which if I paid for them individually I would have saved much more money. So the pitchers are a rip off and I do not recommend getting them rather get single drinks."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant in the junction, and we found the service and attitude kind of shitty. The food was pretty okay but no great shakes. I don't feel compelled to go back anytime soon. Still looking for the amazing Toronto Mexican experience!"}
{"text":"3 of us walked in on a Sunday, near 4pm. The decor is pretty cool, and we were craving Mexican food and a few drinks. The place was not busy, maybe 10 customers, and approx 3-4 staff walking around, not including kitchen staff. We were seated relatively promptly, after the staff checked the iPad for availability in the clearly mostly empty restaurant. He wasn't particularly friendly or inviting, rather neutral - but that's fine. A quick trip to washroom revealed a watery mess on floor, when I briefly mentioned it to the staff member on my way out of washroom, he quickly retorted that \"that's why there is a sign there\" (I can read and I'm not an idiot - but no one was currently cleaning up the 1.5 cm deep stinky water on the floor) - the reason for mentioning it was that it was possible things had overflowed again since the first clean up? 
In any case, I returned upstairs to my friends still waiting for water or drink orders. We continued to sit for about 20 minutes in total. Staff came and went past us, still no water, still no drink order, still no greeting from our waitress / waiter....although we were craving Mexican, the level of service here was horrible ...we were getting hungry and thirsty and we could only imagine that if we hadn't been given water or drinks order in over 20 minutes, how long would the food take? Resentful - we left prior to ordering anything, in fact we left before even being acknowledged by any staff other than the man who say us. ----on the up side , we wandered across the street to the lovely Indie Ale House, where we were greeted with a smile, followed up by waitress who got us water and returned for drink orders in two minutes- friendly, helpful menu advice, great beer selection and yummy food choices - we'd much rather spend our money here - if you're in the junction avoid Playa Cantina, go to Indie Ale House - better service by far, and great food.  Our entrees are here by the time I finish the review."}
{"text":"LOVED.  Great decor, nice staff, quick service, awesome drinks (house margaritas) and food (enchiladas suizas, chilles rellenos, tacos, shrimp starter to die for).  Very cool place in a peculiar part of town.  Sunday night so maybe not as busy as usual which was a good thing.  Loved everything about this place."}
{"text":"Food was INCREDIBLE
We both had enchiladas and they were SO flavourful and satisfying, the dirty rice was fantastic and my margarita was fresh and delicious.
The server could've been more pleasant as he said all of 3 words and may have died if he cracked a smile, 
but overall this was an enjoyable experience and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food is OK, nothing drop dead spectacular (though I remember the fish tacos were tasty). Service was spotty - we got a lot of attention and then none at all. Loud, busy, long wait for tables. I am soured that our pitcher of mojitos was so watered down and full of excess ice, I think they forgot the rum - which is a surefire way to make me pass on the place again. I wish Yelp allowed half stars... this is a 2.5* in my books but I'm rounding down because watered down drinks is a sin."}
{"text":"We happened on this place by accident and I am really pleased that we did!!  We will definitely be back!!  Though we didnt have a reservation they quickly found a nice spot for us (part of 3) and service was prompt, checking in appropriately and also did a nice job to share features of the drinks and food.  Overall, this is now our new favourite mexican food place, there might be others out there but this place just has a great feel, fun music and the food is super delicious!!  
p.s.:  the Pollo Tinga Taco was my favourite of the night but I am sure i will be able to add more to my list in future visits!  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Good Food, had both the shrimp and the chorizo tacos.  Shrimp tasted pretty good, wish they had used normal sized shrimp instead of shrimp shrimps but good taste.  Chorizo was nothing special at all, too many places serve shite chorizo in this city.  Ambience is great,  our bartender/server was fantastic.  I would go again, not really go with the purpose of going but more like if I was in the area and felt like a taco I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Half decent food i suppose, but very expensive. They keep the fish skin on the fish meat in case u order the fish tacos. Also they are 2 dollars more per taco.  10 bucks for corn? Ridiculous... not impressed. For 2 of us it was 120 bucks. 2 drinks each."}
{"text":"Watching the servers interact is like a crappy soap opera, but everything else about this place is aces. Food is amazingly good, service speed is good and some of the servers are really nice and down to earth. The cocktail specials I've had were way overpriced and underwhelming, but their classic Jimador is really good. The menu specifically outlines what items are Not gluten free, most are gluten free, which is awesome for a celiac like me. The salsa is spot on too. Will return for my favourite meal of chorizo taco many times in future."}
{"text":"It may be expensive here, but the food is really good. The enchiladas and the burritos are really tasty. The sauce on it was amazing. What I love the most was the desserts. I really want to go back and have the flan and tres leches cake again. It was so yummy, you wouldn't believe it! The staff is amazing. They are really friendly and helpful. I really enjoyed talking to them. Overall, it was a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Playa Cabana Cantina and I absolutely loved it. We went there with our friends who are both chefs and the love this place and wanted us to try. I tried the hard shell shrimp taco (camarones el diablo) and soft shell chicken taco (pollo al carbon) and fell in love with both. I was still hungry so I had one more shrimp taco before I called it a night. Wife had Guacamole/chips to start, which was great. Then she had verdura raja taco and chihuahua taco (she's vegetarian). She like the chihuahua one better.
Our friends had an octopus taco (pulpo), vegetarian chorizo taco. The octopus taco was amazing. The vegetarian chorizo was okay too. They also has Chile Rellenos plate too and it was amazing. We didn't try any desserts as our friends had made some carrot cake at home, which was equally amazing.

The location is great(situated right at the Junction). It's opposite to Indie Alehouse. So have a few nice brews at Indie Alehouse and then head over to Playa Cabana Cantina for some amazing tacos. Make sure to make a reservation for dinner as they are very busy. We reached here at 6:30 PM and they were booked till 9:30 PM. So, we had a few beer at Indie Alehouse before our table was ready."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, had a chicken burrito. My friend got the \"plated\" burrito, which, despite costing three dollars more, didn't really seem different from what I had. We both found the food tasty, but the portions too small for the price.

Second visit, I had delicious beef tacos. A few of their staff have slight attitude problems, but the food is good."}
{"text":"Showed up at the restorant at 10:09 the waiter said they closed the kitchen at 10 it was showing online open until 11 that's why I drove there. Still showed open now... Can't believe it we were sent back"}
{"text":"This is a good place to party but not to eat, especially with another couple. We have been there two times.  The first time we ordered various tapas hoping to savour each one separately, but they arrived all at once.  We tried another strategy  on our next visit.  This time we decided to order just one item per couple at a time.  This turned out to be an even worse decision.  Each time our friend's food came a good twenty minuets before our food arrived. In all it took 1 1/2 hours to get our food.  Also, the service was lacking. We needed to ask our server for water every time it ran out.  We also asked for an extra plate, but it never showed up. The food was pretty good, but the experience negated anything positive that could be said about Playa Cabana in the Junction."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends to celebrate my b-day.  Did this last year as well and everything WAS top notch.  Not the same experience this time around.  
We asked for a chair, which they must have built from scratch considering how long it took to arrive at our table.  Server was impatient and borderline rude, not to mention extremely slow.  They overcharged us on the bill and when we brought this to our miserable server's attention, we got a \"fine, I'll take it off the bill.\"  Um..next time, try adding \"sorry\" in there buddy..he must have received the same customer service training as Hydro One/Toronto Hydro employees.

Food was real good, a bit overpriced though.  just a shame that service was not up to par..not even close."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem of junction. I live just around the corner and I'm so happy that playa cantina is in my neighborhood. I was there few night ago and I had such a great time. Guacamole omg so fresh and tasty. Tacos- every one I have tried was amazing. I loved it. This is not my first time here I've been here few times but I have to leave a review because I feel that every time I go there food Is even better. And I have tried dessert I forgot the name but it was some kind of doughnut in sugar and caramel peanut butter. I don't know how it's called but it was heavenly. Go check this place you are not going to be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Mexican places in the city! I'm getting hungry just writing this review. Normally quite busy on the weekends, so it helps to make a reservation. If you prefer a calmer meal, it's also nice going for lunch during the week. It's definitely worth trying at least once and there are a lot of other bars nearby to make it a full night out."}
{"text":"After having a beautiful meal here a few months back, we decided to return to celebrate our wedding anniversary.

We were greeted with exceptional service and amazing food.  We did have one issue during dinner but the manager and server addressed our concerns and we left very happy.  

Definitely will be going back.  

Reservations are a must!"}
{"text":"The decor is awesome and the food blew me away.

Over dinner, we were debating whether this place, or Grand Electric, had the best Mexican in the city.

It's a toss up."}
{"text":"This place holds a very special place in my heart because it was the location of a very special date with a certain special person some time ago. That being said, the experience itself of dining at Cantina was nothing short of special!

We rolled the proverbial dice (a poor piece of planning on my part) and decided to show up and try our luck - my date was confident that the bar seats were actually the best place to eat according to her local friends. Unfortunately it was packed... like packed! It's not a big place, so I strongly encourage you to make reservations if you'd like a table. 

That said, my date was absolutely correct! We ended up just squeezing into two seats at the end of the bar and while i had an espresso machine poking into my back for part of the evening, it was one of the best service experiences I've had to date.

I have a theory that when a bartender is required to step up as your server for the evening, they're far more relaxed with their jobs - sometimes that can be a bad thing but from my experience it's always a win for me. They're more jovial, spend more time with you, make jokes and even give you a little something something extra sometimes if they like you. 

Our bartender was awesome! He made incredible recommendations, wonderfully strong margaritas (I think I had about 3) and kept us laughing all night. I credit him for making an early date with my now girlfriend a wonderful experience (especially when there is so much that can go wrong on those 'early' dates).

For food we ordered guacamole which was amazing and arrived almost at the same time he punched it into the POS. ESG (extra sensory guac!?!?) Then we ordered a crunchy open faced taco piled high with toppings (I believe it was called a torta?) The plan was to share it but it was a hot mess so we ordered a second so we'd each have our own - screw romance we need food!

I then ordered a combo of 3 different kinds of tacos. I can't recall which ones I had but my notes tell me the meat was perfectly seasoned, tender and perfectly cooked. 

Overall an amazing dining experience here, and it's actually about time I went back for another great night. Until next time...

Eatcrest OUT!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Outstanding? Not really. Worth making a second trip to try something different? Sure. My steak burrito, though pleasantly spicy (at my request) and having a good amount of flavour, was a bit on the oily & soggy side. Perhaps that may have been my fault though for requesting spicier than normal. The tiny plate it came on combined with the plating & paper underneath (I am assuming to soak up the grease) made it somewhat challenging to eat with a fork. I had tried to eat it with my hands at first but the oil seeping down my hands made it somewhat of an overly messy task. My friend's ceviche was very light and deceptively generous. I enjoyed the (I believe) homemade tortilla chips and the little condiments on the side were delicious, especially the (I am assuming were) charred peppers in oil. I never found out exactly what they were because this will bring me to my next point. The service was pretty horrible. I still don't know who our actual server was but I think it was the girl that kept looking at her reflection in the glass on the print above our table (we were sitting by the front window). I mean, the girl barely made eye contact or even looked in our direction. It was almost comical how into that glass she was, like she was Snow White's evil step mother. She was nice enough, though obviously disinterested in us as customers. Add that to when I was attempting to order the burrito, she walked away before I had the chance to tell her I wanted the steak burrito and not just some random server's choice burrito. I actually had to shout across the restaurant \"I don't think I told you I wanted the steak burrito\" to which she just shouted back \"yes you did\" and kept on walking. My friend was also in agreement that I had not told her (nor had the server asked me to clarify which one I wanted). When the food finally started to arrive, my friend's dish came about ten minutes before mine and we had to chase down random servers to get a second drink even though the restaurant was pretty much empty. They seemed very interested in socializing with one other just maybe not the customers. When we asked to take the rest of our food to go, they asked us if we wanted to put it all in one container. After saying no, they looked puzzled after we had to explain that one of us was a meat eater and the other was a pescetarian and the two did not mix. Anyway, like I said, I would likely go back because overall, the food was good enough, but realistically it may be to one of their three other locations."}
{"text":"Was nice when it opened but quality has slipped very quickly.

At first the portions were very generous and it was great value. The servings are almost half what they used to be and the prices stayed the same.

Not a bad option if your in the Junction but Mad Mexican is much better."}
{"text":"Small but very cool ambiance and vibe! Service is slow though but the grapefruit infused margarita is worth the wait! So damn good-but order two. Food was okay too!"}
{"text":"The servers were really nice, it was pretty busy but that didn't seem to change the food quality because it was still delicious. I got the skirt steak burrito and it was huge.. I was only able to finish half and took the rest home. Best burrito I've had to date!"}
{"text":"The food is out-of-this-world amazing, but why do the chips have to be so greasy?

I order the chips and guacamole every time I come to Playa, thinking that this time they won't be as greasy. But then they always are. Sometimes they are so greasy that the chip itself is soggy instead of crispy.

I don't want to take away from how delicious the rest of the food is - seriously, every time I try something new, my reaction is something to the line of \"how do I marry this taco/burrito?\" But those damn chips."}
{"text":"Recently popped up in my neighbourhood and happened to stumble upon while wandering The Junction in seacrh of a good watering hole for the night.  
This place was super vibrant with real authentic and amazing mexican food which can be a challenge to find!  The service was amazing, which with any new spot can be spotty at best.  Their tequila list was as big as most wine lists and made for some kick-ass maragrita's!  Highlight on the food side was the lobster taco's.  Just exploded with flavour and they werent shy with the serving either.
I'm going to be coming back here on the regular!"}
{"text":"Its a tough call on Playa Cabana Cantina. It was a good meal and the margirita I had was decent. This junction spot is trying to do more \"trendy\" mexican, with a focus on fish and some interesting ingredient choices. I opted for the braised slow pork tacos, which were quite good, with a nice side of guacamole and beans. 

On the other hand, the prices are high almost the same price as Valdez down on king street, which is doing its own haute cuisine take on mexican. On the other hand there is Tierra Azteca down on Bloor which does heaping piles of tortillas and meat. The Cantina does the medium range well but I don't know if i would be rushing back."}
{"text":"Wow I felt like I was in Cancun again , finally an authentic place in Toronto. Just talking about it is making me hungry. So because there was a gas leak in the kitchen yesterday the menu was limited but who cares. Service was great , my patrick swayze cocktail was refreshing and my tacos man my tacos. Mouthwatwring deliciousness I got 1 short rib and 1 pollo. I was so hungry I didnt even take a pic of my food ME !!! Shocking I know lol . My best bet to you is to park in the Green P parking lot by the NoFrills then walk back up Dundas to the restaurant unless your a lucky star and find parking on the side."}
{"text":"I had a disappointing meal here last night. 

Service was pretty, good. Server was very nice. 

Atmosphere is dingy and cluttered, but it's what you'd expect from this chain which has an authentic feel to it.

Food was sub par. We had:

Ceviche - 1/5 wasn't fresh, sent it back. 

Steak enchiladas  - 2/5 there was a smokey chipotle sauce that really didn't go with the ingredients. We sent this back too.

Guacamole - 4/5 - very good

Habanero Steak tacos - 5/5 these were excellent!

Grilled fish taco - 2/5 the fish was very bland and under seasoned, but the taco came with yummy veggies on it.

The margaritas were good. 

My boyfriend had the churros. I found the sauce they came with too sweet, he liked it. I will give the churros 3/5 because we were divided. 

There are 4 sauces on the table. It would have been nice if:
1. there was an explanation of what they were
2. there were spoons for them. 

I don't think I will return here."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, hard to notice though with no real exterior signage. Service was quick and friendly and food was good, better than other Mexican in town. Guacamole, salsa and chips very tasty though expensive. Other portions were small but well made and delicious. I had the chorizo tacos which came with a tiny amount of rice and beans (several bites each).  I would definitely go back but probably only if on an expense account."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place !!!!   The Food and atmosphere are awesome. The only downside is they are expensive  but it's still worth the splurge once and awhile"}
{"text":"Hands down best Mexican cuisine out there!

It just keeps getting better and better and I'm always bringing new people to show them how awesome it is.

Elotes- grilled corn was 5/5. So delicious
Verduras- veggie tacos were mouth-watering, I could not get enough
Tres Leches- the night had to be topped off with the most amazing dessert

Rum punch- had such a nice kick, they really know how to do it. I'll get a pitcher of it next time
Mojito- It needed a little more flavour, was a bit watered down for my taste

Overall- I will never stop coming here. So addicted!"}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying that I'm no taco-fiend nor an expert on Mexican cuisine..but my favorite dishes from Playa Cabana Cantina have got to be the guac and the quesadilla. 

Some points:
1. it is extremely busy
2. It is pretty loud for a restaurant...i would characterize it as more of a bar atmosphere just waiting to get out of hand
3. Did i say it is really busy?

We had a reservation for 9 o'clock and were really lucky to get a table despite the long line-up and the fact that we were ten minutes late. I would say the food is tasty overall--I would come here again and again just to have a good time. I have tried Playa Cabana Hacienda, and I was glad to see the quality of the guac was still the same. 

I also tried the Paloma cocktail which was really good (though sweet) and the LA food truck and Pollo Tinga taco. Both were good, mildly spicy but not too overwhelming. I didn't find it as greasy as I thought it was going to be.  I think the desserts are overpriced. We tried the dulce de leche cake. The ice cream was delicious but the cake was a bit dry despite swimming in dulce de leche jus. I don't think they should be charging $10 for that. 

The service was really quick and food came at lightening speed. 
Ole."}
{"text":"A legit Tequila bar in the Junction sourced from local designers and premium products, Playa Cabana Cantina is a part of Toronto since transformed from the days of Prohibition. A well educated staff with background stories on the food and menu, This isn't the type of place for someone who likes to eat and run. 

Random conversations and stares from a crowd made up of an eclectic mix of youth and historic figures makes Playa Cantina a muse location for those seeking new tastes in both food and flair.

The perfect non judgemental ambience that leaves room to opt out of glasses and switch to straws in a group pitcher of margaritas orgy.

Tequila, Tacos, Talk and take me home.... Recommended to those looking for a change. well worth the wait and late night Taco Trios.

I can wait to see what they do when the local farmers markets are in full swing.."}
{"text":"Beyond rude service. A surly staff member posted a cheeky response to my complaint on Facebook. The management promised publicly to send me dinner on the house along with a profuse apology. Great PR, but when I called them on it, the offered me two burritos and told me to pick them up. 

They claim to offer take-out, but they never answer the phone and don't return messages. I was never rude to them even once but have been treated with a complete lack of respect. Unacceptable and completely unnecessary."}
{"text":"For my money, this is about as good as it gets if you want gourmet-style Mexican around Toronto. The decor in this place is over the top -very creative use of wood, post-industrial re-purposed materials and traditional Mexican decor. It's got a hint of hipster (like most things in the junction) but if you can get by all that, you'll find a menu with enough variety to make you want to come back at least a few times. The Al Pastor tacos were off the charts while the rice and beans was exactly what you'd expect \"gourmet Mexican\" to taste like. 

While I enjoy the similarly-styled \"La Carnita\" on College st, the Milagro quality downtown on Mercer and the authenticity of El Arrieros on Jane st, P.C. Cantina gets my vote for best overall experience."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great, there was a cool vibe to the place. I loved the look and feel. The restaurants was decorated to look like a rustic Mexican place with the wood on the walls, but with a modern twist. They had cool neon light and road signs. The place gets packed fairly quickly, especially on a Saturday evening. It's a nice spot to grab a drink, hangout, or eat some food. So make a reservation before going if you can. 

Guacamole good, but I've tasted better. It was very creamy and rich, and the avocado was blended in. They serve this will crispy tortilla chips. I thought the guacamole could have used a bit more salt and acid. 

I really enjoyed the Basa ceviche, which was yummy. It had just the right amount of herbs and acid. It also had some avocado, cilantro, and onions. 

I got the MGM (mango margarita), which is a nice cocktail. It was a bit more on the sour side, with a hint of mango.

For the most part the service was good. Our waitress seemed knowledgeable and made food recommendations, when asked for it.  She was also very friendly and we got our food fairly quickly. The payment took a bit longer than usual because it was so busy, and our waitress got swamped. 

I loved the octopus taco. The octopus was grilled, and the texture nice and tender. It had a bit of smokiness from the grill. The chirzo added a little bit of spicy heat, which added that extra something. Fried onions and the cabbage, on top gave it an extra textural crunch. Everything worked well and complemented each other.

I didn't enjoy the braised beef taco as much. It wasn't as flavourful as the octopus taco. The taco is deep fried which give it a crunchy texture, but it does make the taco a bit oiler. 

Sadly I was too full to try the dessert. The churros looked really good. Next time!"}
{"text":"My favourite out of all 3 Playa Cabanas.  The pitchers of drinks are STRONGG - but lots of delicious food to pair with it.

If you're sitting towards the back  you can watch the lady making fresh tacos

Leave room for dessert - the tres leches and churros are phenomenal."}
{"text":"The tacos are flavourful and surprisingly filling. The rice and bean side is nothing to write home about but serves the purpose.  The shrimp enchiladas were tasty but not exceptional. Overall quality and flavour profiles very good. 
Nice date restaurant."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!! 

Must haves: 
Chiviche is perfect!! 
Guacamole served in stone with home made chips.
Crispy Chicken tacos 
Braised beef tacos 
Fish tacos 
we got all 3 tacos and they all are excellent!  

Open faced burrito chicken or beef again spectacular!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, but this place missed the mark for a number of reasons . Both the service and food bummed me out. At least if one is satisfactory I make an exception to give a place another shot but not  here.

 Let me preface that I work in the restaurant industry and both my boyfriend and I used to live in large American urban centres that boasted a ton of Mexican restaurants which we frequented.  According to how our waitress spoke to us we were pretty much assumed to be Mexican cuisine charlatans that belonged at Taco Bell. 

I give a star to to the decor and very friendly hostess who was working her second day. Here were my issues though:

-$6 for a really small. single shelled taco. I hate to sound pretentious but tacos should have two shells so they can be consumed without falling apart! It also makes the meal more substantial if you're just dining on a couple tacos. I've never experienced single shelled tacos outside of Toronto, it's not right.

- Our waitress was super holier than thou and assumed we had never dined on Mexican food before which is really far off. My boyfriend ordered a steak quasadilla which was so flimsy and soggy it was falling apart so he asked for a fork and knife. Our waitress retorted \"ohhhh, well it's actually finger food, but I guess I can grab you that\". While giving total stink eye. What's with the attitude? If the dish wasn't mushy we wouldn't need a set. This was about the third time she did this, previously it was when we were asking about how things were prepared. 

Anyways, we left, $60 later still hungry and jonsing for $2.50 loaded tacos in Chicago without snooty service.

I really want to a find an awesome Mexican restaurant in Toronto, but the search continues."}
{"text":"I suggest making a reservation if you want to go at a busy time! They have full service bar seating, which is fine, but if you want a real table, call ahead. 

Started off with amazing guacamole and homemade chips. The tacos are small (and cheap!) so we each tried a couple different flavours! They were all really yummy. 

As you'd probably expect, they have a really good selection of tequila, but also have some fun mixed drinks and reasonably priced beer bucket."}
{"text":"I have been here twice before once in fall of 2013 and once in April of 2014.  Both times we were both pleased with the food and service.  I did however have to physically change the chairs because I wasn't happy with the high chairs to begin with but it was worse if you got a stool and not a chair with a back to it.  I noticed many people complain about the service but both times I had no issue.  Portion size is acceptable considering you're not the States.  Get used to that I guess... some of the other Mexican places in Toronto have similar portion sizes so it's not necessarily out of place."}
{"text":"The tacos were great. Ceviche was fresh & delicious - though had a little too much cucumber in it. The beer was cold. The atmosphere was great - lively but not too loud. Service was attentive and responsive. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Just flat out excellent service, ownership, and of course... food.  

They know their tequila... just ask.

5 Stars..."}
{"text":"The food here was great! 

Our server Alanna was awesome! She had a great and fun personality! She answered all of my questions about the food and beer.  Ask her about the time she climbed the ladder behind the bar."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised this place has only 3.5 stars. We decided to check out Catina tonight (Sunday of a long weekend) and arrived at 6pm and this place was pretty crowded. So, don't be like us - make a reservation. 

 Despite our lack of resos, we were able to get a seat at the line of seating behind the bar. Another reason to make a reso: that line is INCREDIBLY limited in space!! 

I had the Paloma cocktail - grapefruit infused tequila...totally up my alley! Very refreshing and tasty. 

We decided to do the guacamole and split the braised rib taco (we neeeeeded to try at least one taco). The consistency of the guacamole was amazing and so flavourful and that taco...omg that taco....we already want to return to try every single taco on the menu. 

As for our entree, we ordered the chicken enchiladas which was really yum and the chorizo burrito -- found the chorizo a little dry but the egg on top was a nice touch. 

My only 2 complaints were the chorizo and the slower service. However, our server was still very likeable and like I mentioned, I'd 100% return for a taco fiesta!"}
{"text":"Had really great fish tacos among many other dishes.  The wait staff was very nice and helpful.  My only beef is that the prices are a little too high for what you're getting.  That said, if money isn't an issue, go for it."}
{"text":"This use to be my favourite taco place. I use to walk in here on a regular basis because of their delicious tacos and cool vibe. The biggest reason I would come here was the taste of the tacos compared to other places. 

BUT.... I gotta admit the vibe and atmosphere is awesome. However, since I started coming a few years ago... they've made their tacos smaller and smaller. TBH the big reason I would come here was their portions of food which I found decent when comparing to carnita (another taco place with a cool atmosphere for a night out). I feel now they've realized everyone else was making tiny tacos and they could do the same. I mean these tacos can fit on my palm. Price hasn't changed but tacos are too tiny. Not cool. Go back to what made your restaurant my favourite taco place. Why you have to cheap out on your customers."}
{"text":"Overhyped...end of story. 

Their nachos and guac are good. Now here's what sucks:
-the guac is way overpriced
-the tacos are WAY overpriced 
-the burritos are terrible, 90% stuffed with rice and very very little protein 
-they take forever, the slowest and laziest service I've ever seen (I've been here 4 times and this is consistent)
-extremely uncomfortable seating for groups larger than 4

Seriously, this place has the potential to be great but accepts mediocrity because it looks trendy and people in this neighborhood overvalue that.

Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service. Sometimes it's tough to get a table but thats life."}
{"text":"My taco obsessed friends and I came here based on one of their recommendations and I'm so glad we did. There aren't many good taco places in the west end so I'm happy to add this to my list. We ordered chorizo nachos, a ton of tacos and some drinks. Everything was very good! There were a few tacos that were better than others but overall a win in my books! It was nice that rice & beans were served alongside too, not something you'd find often. Our server was great too. Very laid back, personable yet professional. We will definitely return for more!"}
{"text":"3.5. Actually.  Service was young. Sweet, but... kinda...Ya know. And the food was almost spot on - guacamole perfection,  flutas  (sping? ) drowned but tasty. Now... the drinks are amazing. Atmosphere is where I was lost, loud and bustling= felt like a airport bar. Go on a week night maybe for a not so cafeteria loud experience? Great for a group though! :') not the best Mexican in the city, but the drinks saved the night!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love.

Great atmosphere! Oyster Bar! Margaritas!

We ordered the shrimp basket (delish and spicy!), guac and chips (ask for their hot sauce, it's made fresh) and a few tacos. Everything was great. The drinks, the food, the server... it was PACKED on the Thursday night we went. We had resos for 7pm.  The place was lively, good music and people everywhere.

Definitely going back to try the crab bucket, the octopus tacos and all their other goodies. Very authentic Mexican.

We ordered three appies, two orders of tacos, a bucket of beer, four margaritas and with tax it was $133 for two people. Not bad for a birthday dinner. We left VERY full and VERY happy.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Back again, but this time they have changed the menu since I last visited. 

Instead of Taco Plates like in my previous reviews, all tacos are single - and you can mix and match. Pricing and value for money is actually okay - it's a substantial portion, but for a newbie, it's a little disconcerting to get one taco for $6-7. Although the server indicated that 3 is good for a meal, they should put on the menu something like 3 Tacos for $18, which seems a bit more worth while for 1 for $6. Just a matter of perspective. 

This is not a date place, espeically if you plan on getting the taco. Dont' get me wrong, it's tasty, but with all the filling piled high on top of the small flimsy tortilla, you're guaranteed to make a mess. 

Got the Grilled Octopus - good and tasty but very spicy - ask for no jalapenos if you need it to be mild. 

The Pork Belly Taco was good, but found that the flavour of the pork belly was masked by some sweet coating and sauce. 

Also the Kalbi, was a great beef taco but tasted nothing like Kalbi. 

We also ordered $5 of chips and guacamole, and chips were non-stop coming to our table after that. Love it. The corn chips were so good. 

I got a Mojito, but a little watered down with lots of ice if you leave it for too long - but it was perfect otherwise. 

Dessert we got the Churros Poutine, with some excellent churros, I wish we could just have them plain and lots more of them instead of this. But perfect ending to a filling meal with a small bit for each of us. 

I still love the decor in here. Although I did enjoy the food better with the old menu, I'll still definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I have loved David's food (the owner) ever since he was running Chimichanga up at Yonge and Eglinton (before he left and it went downhill..it actually catered my baby shower, we were its first catering job). So when he opened up Playa Cabana/Playa Cabana Cantina, we had to investigate.
The food is absolutely amazing. First of all, the tortilla chips are the stuff dreams are made of. Try to stop eating them. I ate 2 baskets the last time we were there..holy crap I had to spend a lot of time working out to burn those babies off. The chips are thick - like the ones you get in Mexico - and house-made. Guacamole is great too - could use some cilantro but hey, I'm splitting hairs here.
I had the shrimp bucket - mistakenly thought it was peel and eat shrimp but it was large shrimp fried in garlic. YUUUM. Tacos - short rib, fish, whatever - all so tasty and so well done. Really authentic.
The ceviche is really tasty as well...everything I have tried on the menu has not disappointed.
Margaritas are yummy and not done with cheap disgusting mix. 
Service has never been rude to me...and I hate hipsters so I would be the first to criticize them. 
Tres leches cake is heavenly...churros are greasy (duh, they're fried).
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"On this visit I decided to expand my experience here further I started with the braised beef enchilada.

The enchiladas in my experience look the same on the outside, and only show Their true flavours once you cut into the shell and unleash the flavour inside. 
After the enchilada I was still a bit hungry so I ordered desert, the Tres Leches. For this sweet culinary treat they earn that 5th star hands down. The tres leches served cold, is a syrupy sweet cake topped with a light serving of cream and I believe cinnamon, the flavour of the syrupy inside while masterfully done is hard to name. The cheerful and helpful waitress who has served me every visit now said she thought it might be banana but wasn't sure. My wife said almond I at first would've said maple syrup but the after taste and smell of this treat where closer to amaretto in my personal opinion."}
{"text":"We would recommend this place for a casual outing with friends. While we did not necessarily find the food too special, but the atmosphere was right, location prime and the staff very friendly. Cantina is an interesting place with a lot of effort put into making it stand out. By the line of people outside, we can tell the crowd is buying in."}
{"text":"Update: My original review was from March, and the restaurant has since stopped serving delicious fish tacos, and started serving tasteless chunks of fish lumped into bland tacos that have the texture of industrially produced pre-packaged tacos, rather than the lovely ones they used to have that tasted homemade. To call what they serve 'tacos' is a travesty. Their ceviche is pretty terrible too. 

I would not recommend the food her to anyone. It's pretty boring, flavourless food, and frankly, it looks to me like neither the chef nor the owner care about the quality of the food they serve. I think it's really sad that one of the few places in this area that had truly delicious food is now basically no more. 

This is one of the most fun bars/restaurants in the area. It has a wonderful ambience, great food, super friendly staff and great drinks. They also have quite a range of tequilas. 

In terms of food, I particularly recommend their fish tacos; they're delicious! The fish is fresh, the serving of fish in each taco is very generous, and they're fried or grilled to perfection. Mmm. They also have two delicious hot sauces, that are actually spicy by my standards (which seems to rarely be the case in Canada :P) Their ceviche is pretty  good as well, and is served with homemade chips. 

They also have late night tacos, served from midnight until closing time. My only complaint about this place is that they don't seem to serve fish tacos as a part of the late night taco menu :( 

In summary, if you're in the bloor west village, near high park, or in the junction over the weekend and looking for a friendly lively place, this is the place to go to for a drink and some great food!"}
{"text":"Went there again a couple months back.  This time the food was quite tasty.  Not authentic, but good nonetheless.  Service was prompt and attentive.  Drinks were good as well.  Will come back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious as usual and the new menu is definitely worth a try, with the vegan tacos being particularly great. The Camarones el Diablo (Spicy Shrimp) crispy tacos are still the best. Bar and wait staff are super friendly and drinks are good too :) Will definitely keep coming back"}
{"text":"Just came back from this place. I was there when it first opened and had a fun experience and decided to bring 4 friends there tonight to check it out. I live in the area and know how busy it is so was looking forward to it...
- we were greeted by our server within five minutes of sitting down which was great. However, She never offered us drinks or recommendations or specials or anything. She simply asked what we wanted to order. We needed more time and she came back within another 5 minutes.
- our drinks took 20 minutes (1 beer and a mixed drink) and the chips and salsa took 30 minutes.
- 3 (of the 5) entrees came out together and then my entree came 10 minutes later. My other friends entree was wrong so the server took it back and didn't come back with the right order until we were done our meal. The server did not offer anything or apologize. At this point my drink had been empty for about 15 minutes and still no offer of another one. This service is completely unacceptable. At this point I asked to speak to the manager and was given stink eye by the hostess at this request. When I spoke to the manager (who was was drying dishes behind the bar and not walking around the restaurant seeing how service is going) she seemed concerned and asked where i was sitting. No offers of another drink or dessert or anything. Never saw or heard from her again. 
- the bill came and there was 30 percent off which was great but still left disappointed and will not be back.
This place is not ready for prime time and although the food was decent, the service was so horrible it's hard to fathom why this place is so busy every night. I guess the hype is keeping it alive. It's too bad because the atmosphere and food is really good and could all be so much better if the service was up to par (or even half decent)
Won't be back and I highly discourage people from going there. You will feel like you wasted your money afterwards, with or without the discount for really bad service."}
{"text":"Great spot. Great food. Friendly staff. Crab cakes were incredible. And the chorizo. And the crispy chicken tacos. And the tacos el pastor. And the etc... Oh and they take reservations. Hallelujah."}
{"text":"Made reservations for a Friday night. Our original seating was not the best as we were right by the door and the overflow of people waiting to be seated were leaning right up on our table. We asked to be shifted down to the end of the long table and were told we couldn't by the host, Which we thought was odd because there was no one seated there. We then asked our server, and without hesitation he moved us down which was perfect! 

The food was very good. The guacamole was excellent! I had 2 tacos which were filling. My husband had a burrito which was fantastic! The specialty drinks were really good as well. Our server was great and obviously helpful. The menu has lots of options! 

All in all we were very happy. Just make sure to make reservations, otherwise you'll be standing for a while waiting for a table."}
{"text":"I really loved this place! It was my first time here after hearing and reading raving reviews about this place and it definitely didn't disappoint. 

The decor was very relaxing but with a Mexican flare. Lighting was dim, our table and restaurant were also clean. 

To eat I got the Camarones el diablo  (shrimp tacos) and a mojito pitcher. The tacos were TO DIE FOR! Apparently one of the best selling tacos on the menu. The mojito, on the other hand, was mediocre and I've definitely had way better. 

Our server was awesome and I'm annoyed that I can't remember his name (he had a beard and long hair, I believe). He was super attentive and helpful with explaining things on the menu and helping us choose a tequila brand we wanted to try lol. 

What also made this experience awesome was the quick service. Although it was a busy Saturday night, our food surprisingly came very fast (especially when you typically expect to wait long on busy nights).

I'd loved to come back!"}
{"text":"I would actually give this place 5 stars however I felt the Mojito's were severely lacking alcohol, like literally no buzz and couldn't taste it. 

But this is one of my favourite restaurants albeit it's a little out of the way for me alllll the way in the junction. 

The ambience is great with all the neon signs and the hipster crowd, as well I even saw Laurence Fishbourne casually having a dinner there.

The food is great, I think it's much better than Grand Electric and they take reservations!

My favourites are the Chicken crispy taco, salsa & chips and the steak. 

As well ask about the specials, sometimes they have lobster tacos which are pretty extraordinary too!"}
{"text":"worst meal worst service rude non attentive waiter for lunch and there was hardly anyone there"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is part of the Playa Cabana group of Mexican restaurants and this one lives up to the name. I actually was not the biggest fan of Mexican food until I went to these restaurants. We had the pulled pork, fish tacos and shrimp taco trios. The best was the shrimp but they all had their merits. Highly recommend finishing off with a churos poutine.  The reason this restaurant doesn't get 5 stars is their staff at this particular location a little rude. I left stuffed and satisfied despite not being impressed by the staff (the other Playa Cabana restaurants have great service, however)."}
{"text":"So so good - probably the best Mexican in Toronto. Interior is killer, great overall vibe and experience. I've been several times and honestly everything I've had has been great. Definitely try a few of their signature tequila cocktails and."}
{"text":"Went here last night at the suggestion of a friend. We ordered the halibut ceviche that came out with baked nacho chips that were delicious and sadly, the highlight of this dish. I was surprised by how many chips they gave us compared to the tiny amount of ceviche that was presented. 

We ordered 3 tacos, out of the 3 the one that stands out the most to me was the grilled octopus taco with the chorizo. The octopus was tender and the toppings added lots of delicious flavour and texture. Second would be the kalbi beef taco that was not as good as the octopus but a close second. Again, lots of toppings that added a good mix of flavour and texture. Unfortunately the halibut fish taco paled in comparison to the first 2 so I would recommend skipping it. As an entree we ordered the enchiladas. It comes with 2 so it's good to share with one other person. It wasn't bad but also nothing special.  

Upon leaving, I noticed another menu that was placed in the window. I was a little confused as to why we didn't receive this seafood menu as well as the normal menu because it had many appealing seafood choices like oysters on the half shell.

I'd recommend checking it out if you are in the area and craving some Mexican but I wouldn't travel just to try this place."}
{"text":"mmm mmm yummy mexican food. 

We started off with a pitcher of sangria that was really tasty but didn't taste very alcoholic. The guac isn't the best I've ever had but it's a close second or third. The portion is good for 2 or 3 people but not nearly enough for a table of 4 or 5. We also shared the shrimp which was perfect because of the spices they used. 

For my main course I got a burrito that was HUGE and I thought I wouldn't be able to finish it, but I couldn't stop eating because it was just.that.good. 

For dessert we shared the churros omgggg they were so good!!! Bite sized with caramel sauce oozing out, just so amazingly perfect I want more now thinking about it. 

The downside to this place was the service, the person clearing tables kept trying to clear our plates too early and even reached over me to get someone else's plate as I was eating."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere. Perfect for groups, or first dates. Food is great, drinks are unique. We even ran into Chef David Aggi there. Very humble and down-to-earth chef. The food combined with the atmosphere screams Mexican food! Feels like youin Mexico."}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday dinner last night! And everybody was absolutely amazing from food to the staff! Our server was extremely friendly and he made our time at Cantina even more fun! They all came and sang happy birthday to me with a sombrero and even a cowbell! It was great! Their crispy tacos are to die for and they have the best guac!! Amazing place!"}
{"text":"Small Portions, Expensive Meals.

The food is extremely tasty and is authentic as it gets HOWEVER, the portions are extremely small with price tags on the very expensive end.

Cool ambiance and good selection of drinks and authentic Mexican Cuisine.

For value, this is not the place to go to.

If you want to taste real Authentic Mexican, Playa Cabana is where to go.  

The Chorizo Tacos are amazing!"}
{"text":"I wish I could eat there tonight!  Food was fresh, innovative, cocktails were superb (they provided off the menu for my mezcal tastebuds).  Erica was awesome, gave great recommendations on the menu as well as our trip's endeavors.  Their salsas can build smokier, spicier profiles into their dishes.   pulpo and tacos were home runs fo sho.."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in Toronto? Maybe. Just maybe.

Nonetheless this place is fantastic! Getting a reservation requires some planning ahead (I AM IMPULSIVE! Wish I could just show up here on a whim like most Junction eateries but oh well), as it is booked weeks in advance.

Got a table for 6 for my birthday and we were not disappointed.

Service was great, very friendly, they did accidentally send one of our dishes to another table though, so one of us had to wait an additional 10 minutes for our dish to come. That was a bummer but it happens.

The ceviche of the day was pickeral and was amazing! The ancho braised short rib tacos had some people at the table saying it was one of the best things they've EVER tasted. 

Pork tacos + pineapple was a big hit, as was the seared rib eye steak.

The chipotle burger was a bit dry and overcooked, it was asked for \"medium\" so maybe you wanna ensure to ask for \"medium rare\" as this one felt \"well done\".

Sangria was really good too, if you like it less fruity and more wine-y, like I do.

Will be back many many times!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Mexican food this is not the place. Just ate there, ordered the chiles rellenos. Batter was not good, rice was undercooked...I was expecting better!"}
{"text":"I'd been waiting a long time to eat here. It's so busy at dinner that we could never get in when we dropped by so we came for lunch last Saturday. We were greeted and seated right away and the prompt service cont'd. That was a plus. We ordered the guacamole to start. This was served with a generous portion of fresh corn chips. This was big for two and would be just the right size app for three. As it turned out this was the highlight of the meal (at least for me). My friend had the crispy shrimp tacos and loved them. I had the fish burrito and was disappointed. It was bland and filled with more  rice than anything. It was also seved like a snack you'd eat with your hands but drizzled with a crema sauce that made that idea messy and near impossible. I ate half my burrito and traded the rest for one of my friends shrimp tacos which I thought were pretty good (better than my choice) but not great.  For the price and the rave reviews, I expected a lot better. The location and service was great and because my dining companion loved his meal, I'm giving three stars. I would try it again at some point just for the excellent guac and chips and to see if some of the other menu options are any better than the burrito."}
{"text":"Decor- wow. Food and margaritas not that great. I think people are too easily wowed by hype, crowds and appearance. 
I've been twice in the past week after failing to get in many times before.  Starter nachos seem homemade but you never know if the chip you just picked up is going to be salt-free or coated in salt.  Salsa and guac accoutrements were just okay. 
We 3 had 3(!) pitchers of margaritas and ended up not that high, so I have to assume they are watered-down.   Delish, yes, but I'd like to get what I pay for, booze-wise.
Tacos: short rib tacos were fine but again, not exciting, and I had all-the-rage fish tacos for the first time ever and have to ask: are they supposed to be flavourless?  Because these were.  Pork belly taco- fair. 
Having said all that, the service was good if a bit slick, and the decor is about the best in Toronto.   Oh, and hot sauces were yummy, and really hot. 
But I'm sticking with La Revolucion just down the way, when I want to get my Mex on.  It's calm, pretense-free, delicious and charming."}
{"text":"Oh man, I always come here to get some tacos ! But Today I came...
Reserved my table, everything was good.
Once I sat down there was a beetle on my chair....
Ewwwwwwww 
Left right away 
Never coming back


Eww sorry I went online and it was cockroaches"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try the fish tacos here but was disappointed. The fish,  beef and pork tacos are okay,  great sangria,  but I'm still on the hunt for the best fish tacos that are comparable to the ones I had in Mexico (trying banh MI boys next!) This place is just a bit too cramped,  busy and loud for my taste.  Will try again though."}
{"text":"Phenomenal short rib taco..
$6.78 for one small, individual taco...?!
Did they have a contest to see how much they could overcharge for a small piece of food?
The prices eliminate return visits."}
{"text":"When talking immigration reform in the US of A... what better place to go than your local Junction Mexican eatery: Playa Cabana Cantina ! 

Like telling the girl you just started dating that you have a baby/baby mama....I'll be upfront on why they only got 4/5.... nearly making this one of the few flawless dining experiences I've encountered in Toronto. 

... 

The reason being....that I can't stand Mexicans. 

... 


I KID I KID ! JK JK ! Love 'em! Couldn't be further from the truth ! 

The only gripe I have with this place is that when we were seated... they sat us by the bar with a gentleman who was shucking oysters....literally 3 feet away from me. This place has a really great seating area but out of the empty tables they had available... I don't know why they placed us at the table/bar that had a man standing next to you shucking....literally directly beside me as I was on the same side as the employee. 

Now I'm down for a shuck every once now and again.....just make sure you kiss me on the mouth when it's done..... but little did I know that this guy was our server. It was Sunday, so to be fair it was probably slow and they needed people to double up on roles.... but to me that's like sitting next to the staff table while your server sits there and roles cutlery. I would much prefer that instance, as shucking isn't really the most glamorous thing to look at while eating... let alone seeing the poor guy struggle to get a shell open, I shucked it off. 

I'll say it was convenient to just tilt my head and have him within earshot... but it just goes to show what the priority is, opening oysters or catering to your customer .... for all I knew he didn't give a shuck about me. 

(okay I'll stop) 

As far as the food went.... it was outstanding. Up there with some of the best Mexican I ever had in Toronto. We tried 5-6 different kinds of Mexican delights for the sake of variety... and not one disappointed. 

Short Rib Taco took the cake..... I believe it's one of their specials so be sure to ask of it when you stop in ! 

Decor was fantastic - the staff very friendly - and the prices really weren't that bad considering the high quality of the food. 

Playa Cabana Cantina .... Can I get a What? What? 

Or shall I say... Can I get a ¿Qué ¿Qué

{"text":"I've been twice now to this neat little Mexican joint tucked in the junction, a place where margaritas flow and the food comes out fresh and fast. We started with guac, which is actually mandatory at Mexican places, I'm not sure if you know that or not. On my first visit I tried a couple little tacos and on my most recent visit I upped the ante and went for the original plated burrito, a massive beast of a chipotle chicken burrito that came drizzled in delicious sauces and salsas and topped with more of that handsome guacamole. It was an impossible meal to finish, but I enjoyed every bite of what i did have. I love the decor in this establishment, it's fun and full of signs celebrating toronto, the junction and that Mexican influence. Service was great and they were able to easily separate bills for our large party. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.

Mediocre service.
Mediocre food (better guacamole for a fraction of the cost at Chipotle).
Overpriced with little value.

Overall, very dissatisfying and have seen far better options in Toronto."}
{"text":"Just discovered this century randomly this weekend and I don't know if it was just because we were hungry or what but the food was amazing. 

Fish tacos were perfect, guacamole & nachos was great and the esplanade salad ... absolutely amazing. 

The ambiance is very original, cultured and cozy so it's very nice."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I've only ever had one thing here because it's so good I'm not sure I could do any better! The plated chicken burrito is so delicious and serve with 2 different sauces on top. Can't recommend it enough. Good cocktails and sangria, good service, awesome atmosphere. Only complaints would be that it's a bit on the pricier side, and that it's hard to get a table. Most of the time the two of us are sat at the bar along the wall."}
{"text":"Last year my friend took me to Playa Cabana Cantina and I fell in love after one bite. Seriously... 

It's really hard finding a good taco place in Toronto, La Carnita had recently changed their menu and removed one of my favorite Taco options :( but thank god for Playa Cabana. I also love the atmosphere here, grab one of the long tables and make some new friends. 

I've had a few items here, and I always go for the Braised Short Rib options, the meat melts in your mouth and is filled with flavor. I would definitely go for the crispy taco with cheese + Braised Short Beef (fucking BOMB) I'm not joking, this taco has to be the best taco I've ever had! Another item that I'm in love with is the Braised Shortrib (in ancho chile) Enchilada! One bite and there's an explosion of flavor... I can't even explain how good the braised beef is.

If you want a monster of a meal I would go for the Burrito, but we warned... they are HUGE! It's more of a Knife & Fork Burrito. I got the  Pollo Milanesa which is breaded chicken. It was pretty good but again I would go for the Braised Beef options. If you are still hungry after all this great food, opt for the Churro Poutine! Yummmmy! 

Whatever you end up getting, please get one braised beef crunchy taco on the side... TRUST me, you won't regret it. 

Keep Eating,

{"text":"This is a resto-bar on a recently re-energized part of the Junction that needs to be experienced to be understood.  While only open six months it has the feel of a much more established venue.  A rusted out \"Liquor\" sign spanning the length of the bar anchors a very tight, gritty space that channels Tijuana.

Tacos with Oxtail, short rib, pulled pork and tilapia grace the menu.  guacamole is individually made in a mortar and pestle serving dish.  A limited beer selection made up for by a significant tequila collection.

Hard to get a table, both times I have eaten at the bar.  A standout in this awakening neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place opened up!

I had the pork carnita burrito (huge, I recommend sharing),the octopus tacos to start (delicious, but tiny portion) and some sort of margarita pitcher (great, not too sweet). 

The atmosphere is fun and lively, and the service is friendly. After hmmming and haaahing thinking of our waistlines and deciding against getting churros for dessert, the waitress brought them to us on the house. Can't say no to that! They were hot and fresh. 

Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Cantina is a great place to get really flavourful food. My only warning is that if you don't like spicy food don't go here since a lot of the food is spicy; flavourful but spicy. Thankfully for me this is not a problem, I thoroughly enjoyed the food. The menu is not immediately clear on what the offerings are as the items are not spaced out well, mashed together and partly in Spanish. I honestly spent more time deciphering the menu than deciding on what to eat. I guess I could have asked the server. The pico salsa was good but the guacamole was exceptional, i couldn't stop eating it. I couldn't decide on what to eat so I ordered three different soft tacos, the pollo, LA Truck and carnitas. I wasn't fond of the LA Truck but the other two were outstanding. They were a great combination of flavors. My wife, who doesn't like spicy food, had the tres leches and was pleased if not amazed with it.  All in all a good meal."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, especially the tacos. Generous portions that are as beautiful as they are tasty. The Dave's Margarita is a spicy twist on a classic.

For me, the turn-off is the service. I have been three times now and every time the server tries to ram drinks down your throat. Obviously they want you to spend more money but when you say you're not interested they get a little mad and give a bit of attitude. Your bill will for sure be around 100$ or more with only one drink (2 people) so I don't exactly understand the pressure they put on you. Overall the service here stresses me out too much so I don't know if I'll go back... I probably will..."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with a friend who lives in the area.

I must say décor makes this place. They've really put effort into making this resemble an authentic cantina and it shows. Between the saddle resting over the half-wall by the door to the signs located throughout the place, they've created an atmosphere that doesn't make you feel like you're in Toronto.

Their menu consists of one page of drinks and one page of food. I ordered their 'homemade lemonade' to drink and was frankly underwhelmed by the experience. Especially considering their lemonade is carbonated (yes, carbonated!) and I'm one who can't tolerate carbonation to any degree.

Now the main was a different kettle of fish (not literally, although they have many dishes offering seafood, I sprung for one of their vegetarian options) was a Cantina burrito with fresh vegetable filling. This was tasty and not overly spicy. They were also quite sizeable but it's a meal in itself. I also quite enjoyed the guacamole they used as a garnish, considering it was not spicy at all!

I would recommend this place as a suitable option for people in the junction and BWV area who are looking for some reasonable mexican food."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this restaurant for years, i recommended it to so many people because it used to be amazing. it was so good, that my colleagues used to order lunch there every friday.
Suddenly, the portions started getting smaller, the hot sauces stopped coming with our orders, and lately the food has been less than expected.

Today i decided to give it another shot and ordered some tacos via Ubereats. 
As soon as it arrived, I opened the takeout box and saw that my guacamole was blackened- as if it had been a day old guac they had left over and just dolloped over my tacos.
Now for kitchen standards to send that out to a customer is unacceptable. Its old guac, poor quality food being delivered. 

I called the restaurant immediately to complain, and the waitress or whoever answered, basically blamed the uber driver for taking to long to deliver the food, and so that was the excuse for blackened guac. No apology, nothing; basically said i needed to contact Ubereats to complain instead of the restaurant. 

As a former playa cabana cantina fan, I wanted an explanation as to why the $16.00 tacos came to me with gross black guacamole, instead I got a snotty chick telling me it was someone else's fault rather than the kitchen itself.

I know they changed management, but it hasn't been for the better, because everything that was good about this place has just deteriorated. 

I really hope they step up their game, and treat customers better than they have lately, especially when it concerns the quality of food that we as customers are paying for, and expecting better quality."}
{"text":"I've had Mexican food previously in Toronto and in my travels abroad and I have to say this is the best I've ever had. I live in the neighbourhood (The Junction) and the place is always busy. I had the Al Pastor Taco with Rice and Beans, my friend had the Burrito with the fried egg on top along with a few Amber Dos XX. My friend is from Central America and he loved the food we were served, he also ordered the Double Tres Leches, said it was one of the best he has ever had."}
{"text":"Playa Cabana has entered the land of restaurant bliss- the point where you have all the customers you want regardless. Who needs to have pride when you can just have money?

On a recent visit I sat at the un- air conditioned bar. To be fair to the bartender, he was the only one serving the bar and making drinks (rather and necessarily hurriedly) for every last person in the place. 

I waited for a very long time to place my order. Once it arrived, it was completely wrong. I waited much longer for the correct order (a 17$ salty shrimp burrito with rubbery shrimp). I was never offered another drink (after finishing an average 12$ sangria). The small six dollar basket of chips were the best thing. After it was all said and done, I was charged for an additional burrito rather than receiving 1/2 of my chips for free or an apology for my trouble. The extra burrito was at least removed from the bill.

Anyway, none of this matters. There are lots of people who will continue to wait too long, pay too much, and settle for less here. If you are one of them, you should at least wait until it is not hot outside, so you won't sweat while you wait. You should also pre-drink so as not to notice the lack of service."}
{"text":"Thank god there's this great Mexican place within walking distance of home! Very popular spot now in The Junction where other nice restaurants are popping up regularly. The margarita was great, they will make it more sweet or tart to your taste, nice that they ask, and isn't just made with some syrup! I had the beef and scallop tacos, each $5, very reasonable price. The steak was the tenderest and juiciest I've had, no fat or toughness to it. The scallop taco had 3 large scallops, the scallops cooked to tender perfection. Love this place and will be back regularly!"}
{"text":"Friendly neighbourhood taco joint. Great service, nice people. 

Ordered the mezcal margarita but they ran out of freshly squeezed cane juice. No problem; the wine suggestion matched perfectly. Was looking forward to some cane juice though. 

Tacos were small but delicious. As were the guac and chips. Blue corn, served warm, and made well. 

I sadly was not completely on board with the dessert. Flan was good, but wasn't too keen on the cheese \"crust\". Interesting execution, could be better. The masa-like cake was also interesting because of the texture, but the whipped topping was tasty. 

Fun decor. Overall a nice time with an old friend."}
{"text":"Food was great, We ordered Camarones al Diablo and Burrito bistec, and they were spectacular. The margaritas are a bit pricey, good, but in a very small glass.  The service is excellent, they were very busy on a Friday night, but our server, a young cool guy, was always attentive, he made a few helpful suggestions, and in the end made a small talk, never looked rushing like servers in other busy restaurants.  I will come back to try the other dishes they offer.  :)"}
{"text":"This has to be one of worst restaurants i have been to in a long time. Given the many positive reviews i decided to give this place a chance. 

In Summary

-Horrible service, wait staff not knowledgable regarding menu AT ALL, waitress did not even try to strike up a convo or make any recommendations, slow service to top it off even with the restaurant not busy
-Rude, very fake bartenders
-Overpriced food, decent quality 

Overall not worth wasting your money over. There are far better Mexican restaurants in T.O."}
{"text":"I love this place! It has more room than the other Playa Cabana's around town, & has the awesome corn appetizers the location on Bloor is lacking!

My only suggestions are: reserve a table because it gets pack fast! & watch out for random spicy hot sauces that will cause your lips to light on fire!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. Atmosphere and decor was a little lackluster. We had the corn to start which was tasty but way overpriced. I had the crispy tacos (pork, chicken and shrimp) and they were all really greasy. I was enjoying the various hot sauces provided however. My sangria was fine but again quite pricey.  Are we seeing a trend here? Our server was nice but trying way too hard. He sat down beside me and explained everything on the menu to me - yes I know how restaurants work, thank you. Lastly, bathroom was NASTY. Overall glad I tried this place but would not return. You can find better tacos and atmosphere somewhere else for cheaper !"}
{"text":"As a former LA resident, it probably goes without saying that I love Mexican food.  I was excited to hear that this place had opened in my hood and gave it some time to \"settle in\" before visiting.  My bf and I stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and after a few minutes were greeted by someone who asked if we had \"rezos\".  Since we didn't we were offered seats at the bar, which was fine by us.  The bartender promptly gave us some menus and we both ordered tacos, El Pescador for my bf and Pollo al Carbon for me.  The bartender asked if we wanted rice, and although I said yes, none ever came.  Bf ordered the house made cream soda which took forever for the super slow bartender to make, and turned out to be just club soda with some syrup.  Later I ordered a \"Round Here we Call That Sheer\" cocktail which sounded like an amazing mix of all my favourite flavours, but tasted like nothing more than cucumber and alcohol.

The decor at this place gets high marks, as does the overall ambience, but I'm afraid that's where it ends.  There was a ridiculous number of staff both on the floor and in the kitchen (which is open to the restaurant).  They appeared to be nearly equal to the number of customers in the place, and yet the service is lacklustre and inattentive.  While the food came in a reasonable amount of time and had great presentation, we had to ask for napkins/cutlery.  The tacos themselves were okay.  You could tell that the ingredients were fresh, and mine had pretty nice heat, but for the price you're paying you're looking for something exceptional, not just ok.  $50 for 6 tacos, 1 alcoholic drink and 1 non-alcoholic drink?  The tacos we had at Barque (a BBQ joint on Roncy) a month or two ago were quite frankly much better, and it's not even their thing.  Playa Cabana Cantina is trying too hard, and it's not working.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Delicious spot-on food. The fish taco was sincerely dreamy...TRY IT, you won't regret it! The taco al pastor (sp?) was fine but a tiny bit dry and the Kalbi beef one was moist and flavourful. 

Went with a couple friends on a Thursday night - we literally had to yell at each other to be able to converse. Fun place but super loud."}
{"text":"I really didn't want to come back here due to my previous experience but my friends love this place so much.  Get this, our food never came, the waiter forgot to bring my drinks twice and actually told me that I didn't order anything! WTF?! We were there to spend our money."}
{"text":"Great ambient, food is ok
Staff are very nice. Make sure you know the price for pitchers before ordering it
The menu is miss leading 
We got one sangria pitcher and thought its 12 dollars but it was 60 dollars 
More than half of the pitcher were filled with ice
So very expensive ice
I personally wont go back"}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday party recently. Great vibe and interesting decor. We were about 10 people and they had a long table that was perfect for us. They take reservations which is key for planning a large group event, but there are only seatings at 7 or 9pm I believe. We came for 9pm. 

Overall, food was good. Nothing outstanding, but pretty tasty, if not overpriced. We enjoys the chips and salsa (you can choose green or red, get the green salsa if you like spice!) and guacamole. The halibut ceviche was quite good -- really fresh. For the tacos, you can buy single tacos for $5-12 each or get a platter of 3 tacos for $14. However, we decided to order single tacos because if you get the platter of 3, you can only choose one type (can't mix and match). I think my favourite was the verdura, and I'm not vegetarian. But the black bean/sweet potato/corn patty was delicious and unlike anything I've ever tried. The pollo tinga was more traditional, and it was good but very messy and didn't hold together well. I tried the pulpo (octopus and chorizo), which was disappointing as I could not find a single piece of chorizo in the entire thing! The octopus was a bit chewy.

The service was so-so. They could have been faster with refilling water and the pacing of the dishes, although they were very busy and I know it's hard to manage a large group. They were slow with clearing plates, and with each individual taco coming on its own plate, we didn't have a whole lot of space! 

We had a fun night and enjoyed some of the dishes, but I wouldn't be rushing to come back here with other Mexican options around."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times, but never got around to writing reviews for it.  The tacos aren't authentic, but they're tasty, amazing here, and full of good stuff.  You need to RSVP more than 1 week in advance for any of their locations though.  Be prepared to get your hands dirty.  :)"}
{"text":"A once great taco spot now serves some of the most awful Mexican food in Toronto. Place is grungy. Food is grossly overpriced and downright bad. Staff are weird, not unpleasant, just seems like their first day on the job. 

Used to come here all the time, used to be amazing. 

Had similar experiences twice in the past two months. Dinner for 2 with no dessert or coffee is, no exaggeration, twice as expensive as Grand Electric. Not even in the same conversation, quality-wise.

I will never go back. I urge anyone reading this to never go."}
{"text":"Delivious but unreasonably pricey in comparison to the other gourmet taco places toronto has to offer. And they really push their expensive drinks on you too."}
{"text":"Service:  Contrary to many of the other reviews, I found the service here pleasant.  Yeah, sure, all of the servers are in their 20s, but there was only 1 try-hard who, fortunately, was not my server.  He was just entertaining to watch as he seemed to do more dancing than actual work.

My server was very knowledgeable and even managed to \"up-sell\" on an app!  (Good job, btw.)  Eventually, he did hafta kick us out of our table, but did so in a gentle way, saying that we can stay as long as we wanted, if we moved to the bar area.

Food:  The best thing I tasted was probably the guacamole.  I know how to make a mean guac, but this one had a particular spice in it that added a nice kick!  Other food we ordered were veg burrito and fish tacos.

Even though everything is made on site, as per the server, and tasted fresh, I found it to be on the bland side.  (And I'm not someone who adds salt to prepared food!)  The tortilla chips, burrito, and fish tacos lacked flavour in the way of salt.  It's definitely edible, but again, fresh but bland - if that makes sense.

Probably a good distraction for what the food lacked was the restoration décor, followed by the vibe.  This place just opened up about a month ago, so it did get busy in this quiet part of city.

Overall, it was good as an experience/for a drink/bite to eat, NOT for a first date or anything 'cause it. is. loud, but I would neither go out of my way to go again nor would I be against visiting again!

Other tips:
-  lotsa free street parking, at least for a Thursday evening
-  only order a pitcher of mojito if there are 3+ ppl!
-  burritos are quite BIG, so share if you can OR take out the rest (but it's also saucy!)
-  3 tacos, or at least the fish ones, aren't that filling on its own, so order accordingly
-  watch your step when using the washroom downstairs as there is NO railing, a big Health & Safety concern, esp. for drunkies!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this place for the first time. Wasn't bad but could be better. A bit greasy for my taste and lacked seasoning. Chips were good but some were overly salted than others. Tacos are overpriced and the chips and guacamole considering lack of spices. I did enjoy the crunch of he slaw!"}
{"text":"I honestly can't believe this place is packed almost every weekend. I'll start with the positives. The service was great. Our hostess and waiter were very attentive and nice. 

As for the menu and food, it was extremely underwhelming and boring for a restaurant that praises themselves as some of the trendiest Mexican in the city. Guacamole should've been advertised as just mashed avocado. Salsa was very bland and watery. Tacos were very oily and sloppy. To top it all off all of our 9 tacos were very cold. Don't understand the hype over this place. Save yourself the let down and try any of the other good food joints around the junction.

On a side note, our server explained to us that the restaurant/kitchen was going through a change and transition at the time so they were only offering a portion of their full menu. I'm reading older reviews after posting this one and it seems like some people had similar experiences months and years ago. Weird."}
{"text":"Holy heart burn!! Warning label should be on the hot sauce. Ordered the short rib tacos and the \" famous tacos of Mexico\"
The short rib tacos were very tasty put extremely oily and the pork tacos were pretty plain but the pork was good quality and cooked very well. I was checking out what other people were ordering and everything looked pretty good. I think I will need to try a few more things on the menu before I give up on this place. The ambience and service was exceptional."}
{"text":"Lunch remorse. No fish taco??? No steak available for beef taco?? Taco served was over spiced with anise star or something that dominated flavour. Inconsistent, last time we enjoyed our choices. Guacamole and salsa with chips all good."}
{"text":"This place made hump day more tolerable! Should do some weekday specials.first visit so it would help sample the menu.Friends ordered tacos,and burritos,first visit for all,and not a soul left unhappy with their food,or cocktail. Calamari was grilled,little on the salty side,or it would be perfect. Use the Playa Cabana twitter to announce some \"limited quantity\" specials during the week,count down as they disappear?Looking forward to returning at some point, after checking out the 3 other Playa spots:) Last,but NOT least , the servers, we didn't have a reservation,and yet they fed us.As the early evening turned into mid,the line up started..."}
{"text":"Have been 3x to the location, this will be the last. 
Service was indifferent at best, rude at worst, and definitely more memorable than the food...Most reviews suggest the poor service was due to dinner; we did a late lunch in the middle of the week and they only had a few customers, so I can only imagine the horrors at dinner on the weekend.
There are plenty of other good restos in the Junction that don't actively make us feel unwelcome right at the door."}
{"text":"My go to Playa is always the Dupont location. But a couple of out of town friends insisted on playa cabana and the junction location was the only one that could take last minute reservations. So we ended up here.

Overall, i don't like this place in comparison. The interior isn't close to as nice as the Dupont location, you really loose the charm of the converted home vibe and plastic make do broomstick patio. This place has uncomfortable seating, a little bit of a funky smell and a smaller menu. There are some different things on the menu as well, like the churos poutine (which is the only reason to come here), but i found the food just didn't taste as good as the Dupont location. For example, the fish ceviche tostado was absolutely flat in flavour, where as the daily ceviche (not always a tostado) at Dupont is deliciously lemony and spicy.

But still, it is a playa location and you can expect better Mexican food here regardless. 
The servers are great here, and it's a nice west end option and is definitely adding to the mark the junction is making on the toronto city food map."}
{"text":"The food was good but not worth the price. The service was dull and non-engaging. Aside from the hipsters the atmosphere was great. I wont go back nor recommend. 

A tv would be nice as its World Cup"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times and the food is always incredible. Recently brought some friends in that were visiting Toronto and they loved it!

Make sure you start with the chips and guacamole/salsa, you will not regret it. They'll refill your chips at no additional cost, even after your dips are gone!

If you're really hungry, grab the Huevos Rancheros with pork fat fried beans. It's easily the best thing on the menu. If you're not willing to look like a pig in front of the rest of your dinner party, grab 2-3 tacos and that'll fill you up nicely after you scarf down the chips and dip.

I've had beer there, but on my most recent trip a friend wanted to get a drink/cocktail so I grabbed one too. The Patrick Swayze is terrible, has no presentation and should probably be switched out for a crazy margarita or something. Extremely disappointing for a $12 drink, but you live and you learn.

Service was incredible, but the music is a bit loud so you can hardly hear your server explain the menu unless you're seated right beside them. My friend who is a sound engineer took out his sound level meter and it was bouncing between 85 and 95 dB. He mentioned that anything over 80 for more than 2 hours can result in permanent damage, so I feel pretty bad for the staff.

4/5 because of that terrible drink and the loud music, but the food and staff are incredible and I'd highly recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Everything I could want in a Mexican restaurant. One of the rare places you can get grilled fish tacos as opposed to battered. Huge plus for that alone. The ambiance is great. Service was spot on. My whole table loved what they had. Doesn't happen often. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of friends. Food was very good especially the chicken and lobster tacos. They are definitely must haves here. 

The mojitos were good but like others have said, lacking in the alcohol content. There is also a decent list of wines. 

The seating area and the chairs were quite uncomfortable and that's where I deducted the one star but the food was very good. They also take reservations which is quite important especially to a group as large as ours."}
{"text":"Loved the food, atmosphere and good service here. Best Mexican in the city, hands down IMHO. El Pastor Tacos are awesome x100.  Also the beef brisket tacos, with a crispy charred corn shell were phenomenal.  Ceviche was excellent as well. House made hot sauce is deadly."}
{"text":"When we arrived for a late dinner on a pretty busy weeknight, we took it as a good sign that there was a wait list. The host who barely greeted us at the front gave us an estimated wait time of 45 minutes for a table \"to eat\", so we agreed to have a drink at the half empty bar and see how long we could play the hunger game. 

After picking out a couple of stools and ordering from the much more responsive bartender, I went to put our names down, but the host insisted that we were on the list already (which she later realized was not true). She seemed very disorganized. When offered a menu at the bar, we were surprised to find out that you can actually eat right there, so we obviously opted to do so. It puzzled and frustrated us that the host not only failed to mention that fact, but actively made it seem like that was not an option. 

The food was only okay. The wings that we started with were far spicier than enjoyable or comfortable for the average spice fan. There is not even a word of warning on the menu. My dinner date's chicken burrito was sizeable and reportedly \"alright\". My tacos al asador were brimming with oily slaw, with the pork only making a small cameo. Also, the fact that an order comes with three of the same type of tacos is very limiting for those of us who like variety.

I really liked the bold decor and the cocktails were decent, but the food and service were undeniably subpar. In a city where excellent authentic Mexican food is served in a plethora of restaurants with and without flair, decor alone is just not going to justify these price points."}
{"text":"This place has some impressive things going for it-- great interior design, cozy environment (sometimes maybe a little bit too cozy, like, not in compliance with building code cozy), warm, and inviting. And the food was, at face value,  pretty good-- a variety of different configurations, well-prepared with a nice balance of flavour and spice, and fresh, quality ingredients. So these are my positives.

The negatives-- y'all trippin' at $6 per taco. I admit that I am used to living in a very Mexican city that has very affordable Mexican food, and that I get spoiled when I'm paying $1.69 for a taco, but I don't know how we went from $1.69 to $6.00 and chips are freaking twelve bucks, too. Salsa and guacamole were good, but the chip game was weak. They were thick and flavourful and had the promising topography of a good tortilla chip, neither too flat, nor too curvy, but were super greasy.

Got out of there thinking I had racked up a hefty bar tab and then I remembered we hadn't had anything to drink. I don't really recommend."}
{"text":"I went in there with some friends not knowing what to expect.  The ambiance and decor was fun.  I was pleased to see they had vegan options.  I ordered the vegan burrito.  It was amazing!!!  The portion would've probably been enough for two and it was so full of flavour that I could not stop eating.  The food prices were reasonable but the alcool was a bit pricy.  I don't drink so ordered sparkling water and the water kept on trying to sell me alcool which I did not appreciate.  I would definitely recommend the place and would go back if I'm ever in Toronto again."}
{"text":"Unreal Lager on tap , Guac and Chips and make sure you get the Ancho Braised Shortrib-Brisket Crispy Tacos (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!) - Also load up with loads of hot sauce (Arbol Chilli Oil)"}
{"text":"Spurred by Toronto Life's ranking of it, I decided to organize a meetup dinner here. It took me 2 weeks to get a reservation for 6 people. It was worth the wait. But, be aware: it is a super loud establishment due to their stereo playing house/electronica at club noise levels!  I hope you already know who you're eating with because it will be hard to get to know them - ja ja!

I ordered the margarita, chorizos and spicy mole. It was A+, stellar food. The mole was delicious - rich cacao & cinnamon to provide the kick behind the chilis. I am satisfied and returning.

My friends ordered fish tacos, chicken tinga, crab cakes, pulpo (octopus) tacos, burrito and everyone said the same thing: food was delicious; and the music is too loud."}
{"text":"Updating my review in light of the menu changing again. Happy to see the pablanos and wet burritos (which are amazing btw) have been out back on the menu. Still missing my ceviche and not a huge fan of the tostadas so review still remains low. Kudos though to the restaurant for listening to their customers and bringing some if their great dishes back. :)"}
{"text":"I've only been here once for dinner on a Friday night and I enjoyed it! The place was packed (there were no reservations left when I called, but I was told I could walk-in). I didn't have to wait long before finding a seat at the bar - our waiter even helped us move to a better location once his other patrons left.

The food was good - really tasty and the portions were perfect for me. The only thing that wasn't so good was that it took a long time to get our pitcher of mojito...and there wasn't a lot of alcohol in it :(
There was just too much ice in that pitcher.

But I do like the food and the decor!"}
{"text":"I love the burritos here! Only downside is the drink menu doesn't have much variety , and i wish the place was open a bit later especially since it's on the junction strip. It's usually best to make reservations or else you might end up sitting on a stool facing the wall. 

I love the street burritos! And the sauces on it are amazing. The chorizo nachos are delicious along with their guac. Service here is also great! Love the bartenders and the waiters/waitresses"}
{"text":"We checked out Playa Cabana Cantina on a frigidly cold night back in February.  I would say that reservations are absolutely necessary if you want a table at this busy new Junction eatery.  They are easily made online at least 2-3 days in advance.

We were seated at a high top for 4 and our waiter, resembling a young Eric Stoltz, encouraged us to get drinks and an order of chips/guacamole ($8) to start.  There was no debate when we decided to get a pitcher of the Cantina Crossroads margaritas ($29) to share.

Our food order - a chicken burrito entree ($14), fish tacos ($13) and short rib brisket tacos ($14).  Added a side of beans and rice to the tacos ($3 extra).  

The brisket tacos were delish and full of beef-y goodness but the fish tacos were a little on the bland side for flavor.  Chicken burrito was a hearty size.  Margaritas were tart, refreshing and took our minds off the -25 degree weather outside.  Could have definitely used a few more chips in the basket with the guacamole order...we ran out and still had guac left which I shamelessly dipped my tacos into.

A good meal and a fun atmosphere that took us South of the border and back without anyone getting Montezuma's Revenge.  Arriba, arriba!"}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner with hub and our two kids under 5. Got in just before the dinner rush and the place was empty! Ordered the flautas for the kids (it was ok. beef was dry and a bit tough), Three tacos (scallop, halibut, and the la truck). All were just ok. I found the meat dry and seemed like it could have been sitting in a pot for a hours. Also ordered the cantina burrito. It was beautifully dressed however, for $13, I would have been happier w Burrito Boyz. I may be wrong but did they really charge $2.50 for bottled water?  On a different note: try the green hot sauce on the table! Lots of heat and good flavour. The red sauce was salty!"}
{"text":"We made a special trip to the Junction from Richmond Hill on the strength of a friend's recommendation to try this restaurant and we were not disappointed.  The guacamole was out of this world.  We loved that it had a kick to it but not too much such that the 11 year old in our threesome found it not too spicy.  We also ordered the grilled corn which was good but I would probably not order it again as it wasn't great.

The three of us split two Tres Tacos plates - one with fish tacos (battered and deep fried) and the second with the ancho-braised crispy shortrib filling.  The fish tacos were good but I found them to be less flavorful than similar fish tacos I have had.  Perhaps more sauce would have made them better.   The shortrib tacos were messy but outstanding!  I can't wait to go back for more of these as well as to try other tacos and maybe the burrito.    

The Paloma margarita (grapefruit infused tequila with citrus syrup and lime) which I ordered with my meal was one of the best margaritas I have ever had.  We were too full to order dessert.  

This is a happening place with customers streaming in constantly starting at 5 pm.  The service was very fast (almost too fast).  We were done in 45 minutes.  I would have liked to have the food come out a little slower so we could linger a bit longer but I guess they want to turn over the tables."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. Not only was the food expensive and second rate, our server appeared to be hopped up on too much adderall and then cleared our 1/3 full pitcher of margarita when we went out for a cigarette. 

Also, $12 For chips and salsa when the enchiladas were $16? Would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great Mexican food and they have Mexican coke that's made with cane sugar versus high fructose corn syrup."}
{"text":"If you are into $6 tacos, you will probably love this place!

Had lunch here with a friend over the weekend. Place was empty at lunch and service was therefore great as there were only 3 other tables of diners. 

I tried an ensalada picada (chopped salad with lots of ingredients, $9) and 1 taco (the pulled pork, $6). Both were tasty and I enjoyed them. If you want to feel full you would need to order at least twice of that, but since I was having Thanksgiving dinner later in the day, I didn't mind a light meal.

I could see this place being an excellent dinner spot, but think they should have a special lunch menu, because who wants to spend $40 on lunch?"}
{"text":"Third time is the charm. Apparently I wasn't the only one devastated about the wet burrito being taken off the menu, but it's back! Along with forks and knives, normal portions and obviously jalapeños. Bravo. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly and helpful service. The tacos are great, a little too messy but still very tasty. I tried 3 braised beef and they were huge and very filling.  The price is good for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic.  I tried three different tacos and I loved each of the but my favourite was the (spicy) shrimp on a crispy taco.  The service was great; friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  I'll definitely go back for more."}
{"text":"This neighbourhood is not my stomping grounds but my sister asked me to come here because she is a travelin' nurse in the west and she was waiting for an IV to arrive and killing two birds with one stone, she said: \"Let's go for lunch for your birthday.\" Which is always nice. She suggested the JUNCTION which is where she has her injection patrol so she has seen things on Dundas West and Keele that may be promising. Places she has always wanted go but hasn't because lunch is always better at home where you can nap right after. That is how early morning shift people roll.

I know the east end of the city like the veins on my upper boobs so whenever I come to places like \"The Junction\" i feel like I am going to Winnipeg to meet my relatives that I have only heard about from Christmas cards from back in the day when mail arrived in paper form into that black iron box. That thing that attached to the bricks beside your front door that you have been dumping your secret cigarette butts into when you howl into the full moon on those dark nights.

\"Meet me at Dundas and High Park and we'll ask Bob for a ferret,\" was her text...turns out she talks into her phone when she drives and you how that Siri has her own agenda.

We met just before noon and strolled that area of town that time forgot. There is a Gabby's and another pub and a pizza place and the rest is a surreal black and white postcard of a twisted Norman Rockwell painting that has  a noon time tattooed crack whore looking for ten cents in front of an old timey barber shoppe that sells egg creams and actual postage stamps. It's a weird stretch of a few blocks is all I am saying.

So yeah, Cantina was like an OASIS for this east end bitch who blinks not twice at a $4 donut in Leslieville. Seriously cute decor and it was open at noon as promised, none of this late start shite that happens in Winnipeg because they are in a different time zone.

I ordered a chicken burrito and a Dos XX draught,my sister ordered the 3 fish tacos with NO BOOZE because she was going back to work but Monday was Sangria pitcher day...oh sadness because that would have been awesome.

So my one little trip to this west end restaurant warrants 5 stars because:

1. It is the cutest restaurant in the hood. Trust. Sorry but this stretch of town is sad...I know you live here and you're all like 'The Junction! It's so awesome!\" But no. It is not. Yet, at least.  Maybe next year or several years after that. I really do  like that Junction microbrewery beer I can buy in the liquor store at Coxwell and Queen but other than that, the neighbourhood sadly barren. So far. Maybe you have some cute places to talk about, I really don't actually want to hurt your feelings, but that stretch of Dundas  West going east of High Park to Keele is despair on white bread toast...wow, I never say this but gentrify or do something already.

2. Great service, lovely server. I do so wish my sister was drinking and we could have had the sangria pitcher!

3. Best. Burrito. Ever.  And I am burrito fiend, this one took the cake. Concisely wrapped like a fetus of chicken, beans, and salsa with a dollop of guacamole on tip like ke the exquisite afterbirth of Salma Hayek. Perfect amount of food. The one thing that always puts me off Mexican is the abundance of shlop hat looks normal but is crazy filling because it is so condensed and then you want to barf after. My burrito looked tiny and ALMOST made me want to barf but didn't. That is a good thing.

4. I did not want to share it with my sister. I wonder if she had food envy but she seemed happy with her fish tacos. But you know how sisters can play tricks on you, maybe she wanted to trade but we were pretty silent as we ate. Not that we fight or anything.

Will I come back? Not without being blindfolded and gagged with your mom's pantyhose and stuffed in the trunk of your dad's Oldsmobile Delta 88, but I will beg for a Cantina location in the East End, PLEASE!"}
{"text":"I think with so many fusion taco places popping up in Toronto, charging over $5 for a tiny taco is not worth the visit. I found the flavors in the Pescado (fried haddock taco), Al Pastor (braised pork taco) and the Pulpo (octopus taco) to be quite good. The flavors were very bold and strong. The food itself demonstrated clean technical cooking finesse but I just cannot get over spending more than $5 for so little taco... and I truly mean very little...like minute, small... It just did not feel satisfying or justified at all to spend so much for so little. 

We also had the halibut ceviche which lacked much flavor. Needed a tiny bit more acid, a bit more salt perhaps... a bit watery... My lady-friend and I also ordered the Original-Style Plated Burrito for $15. Good flavors... my egg was a bit under. The chorizo was quite good... but would not entice me to order again. 

I think all in all, an overly expensive taco-fusion attempt. Not worth the price when many other taco places can offer equally bold and complex flavors for much cheaper. 

If you do chose to go however, I would definitely recommend the Pulpo. I do think that the techniques involved in making this taco was quite nice and worth the try. Strong smoky, salty, tender balanced flavors make this taco very tasty BUT not for $6... sorry...

Bill came to just over $50... try spending that at Grand Electric and see how many tacos you can get... 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and burritos. I got the fish burrito and loved it. Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Very flavourful. Had the 3 mixed tacos. Not sure if it would fill me up. I was very surprised. 

The cocktails we good. Not great but still good. 
The staff was very friendly. They joked around with us quite a but. It added to the atmosphere. 

I would definitely go again and again."}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 stars

We ordered guacamole ($9), salsa ($6), ceviche ($10), octopus taco ($7), LA truck taco ($6) and grilled fish taco ($6).  Everything tasted pretty good. The guacamole and grilled fish taco stood out as the best and the worst, and everything else fell in the middle as good. Guacamole was the best because it was fresh; the ratio of the cilantro, onion, garlic, tomato and avocado was good, resulting in a thick, creamy and flavourful dip. I noted that the salt was at the bottom of the stone container. The grilled fish taco was the worst not because it was not well made but because it used Basa fish fillet (confirmed by waitress afterwards), as opposed to Haddock fish fillet which was listed in the online menu. Basa was not a meaty white fish. Using it as an ingredient in a grilled fish taco gave the protein portion of the taco very little texture. I could taste the fish, but the loaded garnish overshadowed the texture of the Basa fillet completely. When I searched for fish, I realized the fillet kept falling apart when I bit the taco. 

Hence, if you want to order grilled fish taco, I advise checking with the waitress the choice of fish of the day beforehand. If it is not a meaty white fish, opt for the fried fish taco instead, or none.

Services was friendly.  Waitress pushed for the cocktails, which I understood.  Just be mindful that the cocktails here are expensive.  Your money will go much further with a local beer."}
{"text":"So the Mas Playa family of restaurants now, as of this writing, numbers six (!), and yet this was my first visit to any of them. And because the food was just good but not great, I have to wonder if this is a case of too much expansion too quickly.

We started with orders of the Guacamole and the Chorizo Nachos. The guacamole was good but a little bland, and the portion size was almost comically small. The Chorizo Nachos, on the other hand, though also small, were a gloriously gooey pile of nachos and cheese.

For my main, I got a carnita Cantina Style burrito with black beans (flour tortilla wrapped with melted Oaxacan cheese, rice, and your choice of beans. Garnished with guacamole, queso fresca, house made Mexican stlye crema, cholula, radish). Now this was an incredible disappointment. Though technically fine, this was the blandest burrito I've eaten in a very, very long time. I've had burritos at Taco Bell with more flavor. It didn't help, certainly, that there wasn't even a hint of spice to be found within. Just terrible.

At least we finished the meal the Tres Leches cake, which, though not quite saucy enough, ensured that the meal ended on a positive note. But that burrito... Yikes! What a trainwreck."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on Valentine's Day with a friend. It was the Sunday of the coldest long weekend ever. 

It is the sister restaurant of playa cabana on DuPont. Same menu. Similar decor which is Mexican gas station-hipster-chic. Picture large neon signs that say \"tequila\" with reclaimed wood and mood lighting. If it were bigger it might be cheesy, but it's cramped junction digs make it feel authentic and a bit romantic. It was much less busy than the DuPont location (maybe it was the weather, though rare is the restaurant that is as busy as the DuPont location). 

He menu is solid. I don't think anyone here has criticized the menu. Good selection of tacos, entrees and appetizers. We had guac which was good but the chips, deep fried (I mean really deep fried) are amazing. I have the chile rellennos. A beaded chile pepper stuffed with cheese and topped with sautéed onion and tomato sauce, accompanied by black beans and rice. It needed hot sauces and I was quickly brought a sampler of 4. 

The principal criticism I have read here is with respect to service. Maybe I went in with low expectations but I thought the service was great. From the hostess to our server, everyone was very nice and solicitous. I had a draft beer and the server pointed out to me that they had some difficulty with the gas. I told him that it was a bit flat, but that I liked the flavour and that I would stick with it. He popped by halfway through the meal to say that even though I was ok with it he didn't think they could charge me for it, so they didn't.  I thought that was a very nice touch. 

I have to admit, when in the junction I have steered clear of cantina with the expectation that it would be impossible to get a seat (like its other location) but my experience on Valentine's Day has changed my mind. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"$120 for two ppl. We got:
- one taco each (pork and fish- both only ok 3/5), total of two tacos. 
- halibut ceviche (terrible, the fish was mealy, small tiny itty pieces of fish, there's cucumbers and peppers in the ceviche, and it wasnt flavourful; Wouldn't recommend or order again).
- Guac and chips were smallish portions and the chips were greasy. 
We had like 6 drinks total 

Overrated. 

Service: total hipster complete  w the pretentious hipster attitude even though we were one of the only two tables in the joint at lunch."}
{"text":"Great Tex-Mex Spot at the Junction. Funky decor primarily composed of vintage signs and memorabilia which really add to the setting. Margaritas are packed with a punch and yummy. Ceviche was refreshing for the hot summer day that it was. The Tacos were superb and unique in that it was (fried)? then grilled....the result was a combination of crunchy and smoky texture and taste. Delicioso! Solid place to grab some Tex Mex fare if you're slumming it in the Junction"}
{"text":"Oy!  What happened here?  We came 6 months before, and it was fairly tasty - I had ordered octopus tacos, and they came 3 to a plate, and they also had a ceviche that I had liked.  The staff were nice that time as well.  

This time, I ordered the fish taco, the LA truck taco, and the beef taco, and they were just \"meh\" (the menu had changed to individually ordering tacos).  The fish taco and the LA truck taco were really soggy and dripped absolutely everywhere.  Also, it seemed pretty silly that they came out each on a separate plate??  Our tiny table was quickly filled with a bazillion dishes.  Consolidate on to one plate, guys!!  (less dishwashing for you too!)

The guac and salsa were good, as was the paloma cocktail.  The churros poutine was awful - I have never had such terrible churros in my life, it was like they had been sitting out for ages - the peanuts tasted stale and the churros like someone had made them with whole wheat flour.  

The service was really, really, really slow.  Sometimes friendly, sometimes snarky - just overall inconsistent.  Restaurant is super noisy.  I don't think I'll be back again unless in dire straits, it is not worth it."}
{"text":"Really phenomenal tacos. Tried the beef/chorizo and octopus tacos. Both were amazing. Only downside though is price. 7 per taco or 18 for 3 is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"When I usually feel like eating Mexican, always end up at Taco Bell or at my ex wife's - so Playa Cabana Cantina is an upgrade for me. 

The place is cool and the food is pretty great. Nice location to have a few drinks and eat some good food. One of my Tinder premium 1st date location."}
{"text":"I was surprised it wasn't easy to find a seat on a Sunday afternoon but my friend and I managed to get two spots at a shared long table. The decor was rustic yet very artistic and interesting. Although this place is listed as Italian in Google it's not. The cuisine here as the name suggests is Mexican. I had the short rib tacos with freshly made tortilla shells, they were delicious. I wouldn't hesitate coming back to this little gem of the junction."}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey for what you get but it's pretty much the only real dining option that I've found in the Junction area. Having said that, the guacamole is excellent - it's as good as guacamole gets. The steak flautas were very good and so were the tacos - we had the pescado asado and carne asada ones.

I enjoy lingering here after my meal just sipping a drink because I find it rather cozy."}
{"text":"If i could give this place no stars i would. I really don't understand how this place can have such positive reviews given the type of people who work there. I have never felt so mistreated and bullied into buying something from the menu. First of all the wait staff really needs to take some time into learning about the menu. If a customer tells you this is their first time visiting the restaurant, it should be common sense to mention if items on the menu are extremely spicy or the menu at least should mention it (to all of you non-spicy eaters beware of carne asada). But then again maybe it was just the server i had (bald lady with glasses)no personality at all. Well anyways i ended up moving to the bar, thank goodness. So it started off great, we were being taken care of by two male bartenders. Unfortunately i was unable to enjoy what i originally ordered due to its extreme spice so I decided to give it another shot and order something else and went with the tacos, now having no trust in the worker's word i was hesitant in ordering too much of something i did not like again. The bartender with a pony tail must have gotten butt hurt (went completely serious, bunch of attitude, fake smiles gone now) since i only wanted one taco and proceeded to making me and my guest feel horrible about only ordering one by continually pressuring us into ordering more after we continually said no until i had to almost yell no for him to back off. Then the douchey attitude came with vengeance. At this point i was ready to leave but i decided to give the restaurant another shot. oh and it doesn't stop there, my guest eats no dairy or avocados and we very clearly told the bartender but he must have been in some other world and went ahead and punched in our order. Then he yells oh do you have an avocado allergy and my guest told him yes, he then proceeds to yell very loudly, making a scene oh i could have killed you, you need to tell me. Well maybe if you actually listened, its not like he was busy with other customers or the music was loud (there was none on), he was just too distracted talking with the other bartender at the bar. Anyways so we finally get our food and bartender then feels the need to yell out very loudly in a mockery way to everyone at the bar you know i almost killed him. Seriously was there a need for that. I do not know where management hires these clowns but these type of people should not be in the hospitality industry, they are making your restaurant reflect very badly. Never will i return or recommend this place to anyone. I could get better service at mcdonalds, without the attitude, he's lucky he still got a tip from me because i was ready to walk out. Message to management: TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES BETTER! Message to everyone else: Don't depend on these positive reviews, i would recommend you to look at the negatives first as these tend to be more truthful. Enter at your own risk! If you want great quality food and good service you are better off elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and ambiance.  Been here a few times.  Have to try the corn.  Anything with their skirt steak is delicious.  The taco selection and ingredients may be the best in the city.  

Why not a 5?  A bit pricey.  $14 for a margarita that comes in a small tumbler glass is too much. But the food is worth the premium price.  

PS. Best guacamole anywhere.  And I mean anywhere!"}
{"text":"I didn't read the reviews before going to this place for lunch . We were at the neighborhood and just went in for lunch. 

I liked the atmosphere and the staff were friendly but very distracted , we had to wait and wait and wave our arms around to get their attention and this is a fairly small restaurant . 

Ordered the cantina burritos which tasted great BUT ( and that's a big but ) this place missed the mark for very important reasons .  I've never been to a Mexican restaurant before that charged you for chips and salsa . There's usually salsa on the table and what Mexican food is served without sour cream and guacamole or something ? My burrito tasted really good but that was that . Just a sandwich on a plate no sides no nothing . 

So taste was good . Service ? price ? Presentation ? Not so much"}
{"text":"First time I came here --- AMAZING. Food was fantastic, service was quick.

A few months after that.. I went again and wow did it go down hill quick.
I had a 9pm reservation, but arrived 15 minutes early.. the hostess told us we would have to wait. Understandable, we were early, so we had a seat at the bar. Did anyone else notice that the drink menu pretty much doubled in price??? It was an anniversary, so we still ordered more than a few drinks. 

9pm rolls around... 915... tables open up and people get seated all around us. I had to chase down the hostess who then said, \"oh yeah, it got busy so you'll have to wait for a free table.\" Um.. HELLO, I have a reservation! \"OH? You do? I guess I forgot, you can sit there\" *points

Yeah thanks. We order some more drinks and food. The drinks arrive, and are consumed.... and time goes by. .. and more time goes by.... Our waiter comes back to check on us, \"So how was everything? Can I grab you anything else?\" ... WE HADN'T BEEN SERVED OUR FOOD YET. 

Thank goodness I had been drinking all that time... for the staffs sake.

I guess this place got too popular too quickly."}
{"text":"Cocktails were quite original. Tried Paloma and Reposado Cidra. Delightful!! 

Ordered the king crab and halibut ceviche for starters. Delish!! 

For mains, we had the mariscos paella burrito, squid tacos, pollo tinga tacos and beef tacos all to share. Incredible!!

To wrap up the night, we shared a churros poutine. Perfection!! 

Our server was very kind. The food was served momentarily after we placed the order which is great coz we were Hun-gry!! 

Thanks for a pleasant evening, cantina!! Well done!!"}
{"text":"Incredible! Some of The best vegetarian food I've ever had. The Veggy chorizo was great but it's probably all great. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I popped by here after work when Indie Ale House was closing up. My friend and I were in need of food. 

We ordered the chorizo nachos and the flautas plus a desert! Everything on the menu looked amazing. The food was delicious and I can't wait to go back. The drinks all look amazing. I was in a beer mood, so I opted for something on tap. Unfortunately, their beer selection has something to be desired. (That's really my only negative comment!( Otherwise, everything is great here! Quality!"}
{"text":"My lunch companion and I are both regular customers of the Junction and the Dupont location.
Today, we stopped in at the Junction for a lunch.  I entered with a coffee cup in hand, having stopped at a neighbouring coffeehouse beforehand.
We were greeted and very curtly told that I was not allowed to bring in an outside drink.  This would not have been an issue if the message had been delivered more politely.  I would have respected the policy and would either have tossed the coffee, or stepped back outside to finish my drink leisurely.
Personally, I think it's a small concession to let a customer bring in the dregs of a coffee to finish while perusing the menu, particularly if he or she is a regular customer who will willingly spend $50-60 at a time.  I've been at other restaurants that don't even bat an eyelash under the same circumstances, but I respect that a restaurant may have its own set of policies.
My companion pointed out that he was a regular customer and expressed surprise that the server was going to turn away a good customer for such a small thing.  The server very rudely said that they served coffee there, to which my companion replied that the Playa family had now lost his patronage forever.
I used to bring clients regularly to Playa, but will unfortunately.now be entertaining them elsewhere.
Whatever happened to treating customers with respect?"}
