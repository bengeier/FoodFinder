{"text":"The restaurant was nice and clean. The service was good. Prices were expensive. The most important thing which is the food was not impressive. I got the Mandi Lamb, it tasted just good but the food came just warm and not hot! I expected the food to be very hot not only warm! Anyway, the meat was hard and tough. What was annoying to me the most is that all of the food needed salt! It seemed that the food was cooked without salt! I also got Lemon with mint which did not taste good. Overall, the restaurant was just ok, but you would expect more for the prices!!!"}
{"text":"I am stunned by the reviews of this place. The food was inedible. The lamb was more fat then meat and the meat was stringy and foul. Even the ingredients did not entirely match what was advertised on the menu. The rice was tough and unappetizing. The staff (one waitress) was pleasant but the atmosphere was dreary. A large open room  (almost entirely without other customers, blood red walls with cracks, ugly linoleum floor, I had to make three requests in order to get all of our silverware. The worst!!"}
{"text":"Um Ali makes the best chicken kabsa in the USA!  You better believe it. They also have the best chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"So my date and I were next door smoking hookah in this hidden place called Vertigo Lounge. The server handed us the restaurant's menu (not sure if it is the same owner) and we ordered the Arabic style chicken shawirma and a virgin cocktail. The shawirma came with this yummy dipping garlic sauce and a side of fries. The freshly blended cocktail which the server convinced me to get (layers of strawberry, mango and banana) was worth it (way better than Jumbo juice). We will definitely stop by next time to try some middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"The best among all Mediterranean restaurants. I recently came to Tempe Arizona. Had khubsa and was instantly reminded of my stay in middle East. Best part is all the food is zabiha Halal and no alcohol. Alhamdullilah."}
{"text":"We arrived the Palm Beach one minute before they close and they welcomed us and even tough we were the only group left in the restaurant they gave us their full attention.   The food is amazing, they have a huge menu of all \"traditional\" western Saudi foods. Their dishes taste like the food in an average Saudi family house."}
{"text":"When we stumbled upon Palm Beach Middle Eastern restaurant this week, we weren't sure what to expect.  Being from a middle eastern family myself, and having some of the best cooking growing up, especially Turkish, we had high expectations going into this place, but remained very open minded.  As you walk into Palm Beach the atmosphere and  ambiance of the place is nothing like the Middle East or, for that matter, anyplace I have ever seen. In fact the place had little or no decor at all, really, just a big room with 20 some table and chairs.    At first I didn't think this place was open.  But their was about 8 tables full of people, so we decided to stay and give it a try.  First the service... It was impeccable period. Very friendly staff, and right on par. Even if the blonde hair girl couldn't pronounce some of the dish.  She was terrific!   The menu... The cover said something like \"food that your mama makes\". I was with my mom and dad, who are middle eastern Turkish, so this added to the expectations and they were ready to critic.   My mom and I ordered the kefta, (meatball) served in a mattlaic pot with garlic glazed tomato sauce with middle eastern spicies... This dish WAS better than my mom has ever made. Sorry mom!  Plus she even liked it, and she is vey picky.  My dad ordered the fresh lamb that fell off the  bone onto to balsamic rice with saffron. It was also terrific.  When the waitress said that the food takes a bit longer than normal restaurants because everything is so fresh, she wasn't kidding... It took 15 minutes. But it was well worth the wait, fresh and tasty.  The food and presentation was by far superior than any Middle Eastern restaurant  I've been too in a long time.  What Palm Beach Middle Eastern Restaurant  lacks in decor and ambiance, sure makes up with the food.  I know they are a new ( only a few months old), so hopefully they will have it in their budget to make the place one day feel like you are overseas,in the Middle East, There are some beautiful places there.  So yes, I will return to Palm Beach to have the best Middle Eastern food in Tempe, decor or not, the food is well worth it... And as they said \"It's  just like mamma made!\""}
{"text":"I ordered Arabic food, which had hair in it. This means that they don't have control over their cleanness in the kitchen. The restaurant's service is always bad all week round. Also, the Jordanian's waiter was the worst waiter i have ever had. Apparently, their main goal was the money not the comfort of their costumers."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents and girlfriend expecting to see crowds waiting, but it wasn't really packed at all.   However,  this place was super delicious. It was our first time trying different Arabic/Middle Eastern food. I asked the lady who took our orders, what was good and she explained to us that their menu has dishes from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Lebanon and Syria.    We started with Hummus and pita bread, then we ordered Kushari (vegan Egyptian dish),  Kufta with Tahin ( Lebanese dish that came with a side of white rice), lamb Mandy ( Saudi Arabian dish which had unique smoked yellow seasoned rice, the plate was big and surprisingly delicious), and  the Arabic style Shawrma wraps that came with garlic dipping and fries. Everyone was satisfied, and we had great time. I will be Back!!"}
{"text":"Ok... I have read some of the other recent reviews about how the place is big and cavernous and the silverware is wrapped in a napkin... Oh my!! But listen guys: the food is authentic, authentic and yes you guessed it: authentic. It's so good that I don't care about the other crap that people care to complain about (like the size of the room). Come here with friends and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean, nice food, good service. One of the best medterian restaurants."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been eating here consistently for the past month and it has been nothing less than exceptional. The service is fantastic and are even greeted by the owners and staff before being seated, it fees like home. I've tried the shawarma which is the best that I've had in the valley. I've ordered it over a dozen times and it's always consistent, top: (mix the red rooster hot sauce with the garlic sauce). The mandi with chicken is on point! Rice is smokey and flavorful, while the chicken is succulent and juicy. Fruit smoothies are sweet and have REAL fruit which makes them a nice treat for Arizona summers. If you really want a delicious dessert try the Kanafah with cheese, you won't be disappointed. Shredded crispy noodles with a gooey cheese filling topped with a rose water syrup and topped with toasted pistachios. Yes, the place is huge with lots of empty space but that's the nice part about it, the freedom to sit anywhere you want with privacy. If you like traditional Arabic music I recommend checking out the hookah lounge within the restaurant. If it's too noisy check out the patio with a laid back atmosphere and misters! A hidden gem that feels like home with great food, hookahs and music. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A home away from home!   Rich flavors that are so spot on good, it's ridiculous. We started off with the Manto, which are dumplings that are steamed and filled with beef and onions. We shared that with some tabouli that was actually done right. We ordered those two appetizers because those are my old time favorites, and man I was NOT disappointed!  We also had the MeatBalls, and in all honesty I've never had anything like them. They were severed in a metallic pot, that was popped in the oven, glazed with Tomato sauce--made to perfection! It was served with rice that I actually eat, which is saying a lot since I don't normally eat rice at all.  The owner of the restaurant also sent out dessert --kunafa, which is made from a very thin batter that is drizzled from a hopper looming above a swirling hot, rotating griddle, where very thin strands of dough are instantly cooked as the batter hits the hot surface. It is filled with cheese or cream, soaked in sugar syrup. Those were baked individually in those metallic pots that the meatballs were cooked in. I couldn't even take a picture of those, because they went just.like.that!  Regardless of the amazing homemade food, this is a restaurant that you can go to and have fun with your family and friends. The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, needless to say, we spent two hours there, and time just flew by.  If I ever want to eat at a middle eastern restaurant in Arizona, I will definitely go to Palm Beach!"}
{"text":"love the food ,, middle eastern Moms Food..."}
{"text":"I like the food in this restaurant. The best dishes were Kabsah , chicken shawarma, koshary,  and om ali. They were all very delicious.  I will visit next time."}
{"text":"I feel here like home I really like it .  I like the food , they are clean and super friendly . They are busy all the time but they still have a greatest service and food .  Fast , delicious, clean and friendly."}
{"text":"This place serves the best Babaghanoush that I have tasted since I left Saudi Arabia.. The rest of the food was good too but the Babaghanoush simple stood out.  The Lamb Mandi was very well cooked that the lamb was simply falling off the bone .Same case with the chicken in the Chicken Kabsah. Juicy and well cooked. I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Did not care for the food or the service.  Many items on menu unavailable.  Had to ask for water refills.  Didn't get napkins or silverware until after both appetizer and main dish had been brought.  Hummus was extremely salty.  Moussaka was very greasy."}
{"text":"The food is actually really good. The hummus, lamb and rice were both tasty. The service level is a bit iffy...one wait person..running behind.  If you don't mind the waiting, the food is worth checking out."}
{"text":"It is middle eastern reasturant.  The food were good.  They have a big space they need to use.    I think they need to use the space, and have more employees.   We ordered the beef with rice and chicken with rice,  the food taste were basic nothing special.   I think it is a nice reasturant to try the middle eastern reasturant."}
{"text":"This place is closed. Sign on the door on 4/3/18 from the County Health Department stating that it has gone out of business or moved. Same with the adjacent/connected hooka bar. Sad, because it was a family owned/operated place, and the food was good. They failed to account for the cavernous size of the restaurant, hidden location off the street, and American tastes when it comes to decor. Sorry to see this place go!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. This is a fun place to go on a date, the kanaffa is fabulous, the most tender chicken on the mandi! Sitting on the rugs and enjoying the very traditional food is a great time. I recommend it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is very good and the service is great. The owner greets you herself and makes sure every thing is going well the entire time. They are also very generous with their portion and their food. Next door is their coffee shop, hookah, music, TV and even live music at night, definitely wanna try showing up for the live music at night. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"We think anyone liking Middle Eastern cuisine should give this place a chance to improve & become really good. It has great potential. The owner is working very hard to this end! They were very friendly & made our evening more special. We'll go back."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could.  I found this restaurant through yelp and the pictures of the food looked amazing; I bugged my husband for two weeks to go, and finally last night we did.   This restaurant is located in the old fox and hound restaurant/bar. Walking in, the space is gigantic and there are only a few tables; huge waste of space.  There is no host or sign letting you know you sit yourself or wait.  We decided to pick a table.    The smell inside is extremely fishy, so much that it's off-putting. Once seated we waited. There was only one other couple in the restaurant at the time that we arrived.  After 5 minutes of waiting,  a guy came over, dropped off menus and walked away.    After paging through the menu we started to notice that we still hadn't even received waters.  After 10 more minutes of no service or water we picked up and left.  This place is a joke.  It makes sense that the place was totally empty."}
{"text":"This place has a great menu selection to choose from. My friends and I all ordered the shawarma on recommendation from our server and some other guests. At first we were hesitant because we didn't want to pick the typical, basic-white-girl option, but we were so glad we did. Delicious! Also has nice ambience with a floor-seating option."}
{"text":"I tried both chicken and Lamb Kabsah. Honestly both were super good! They were made in the authentic way in Saudi! Which is rarely to find here in Arizona, a place that do the same! Also their fish is yummy too!  On top of that staff are super friendly and funny!"}
{"text":"Went in a couple more times and their service had been improving even though they still had a sole waitress to serve all the tables. However, the food seems to be inconsistent. The mandi lamb that I raved about earlier in my first review were still good until my recent visit. I placed a pick-up order of mandi lamb and chicken kuzi (spelling?) and was told the food would be ready in 10 minutes - that's pretty fast! The order pick up went smoothly and after I got home, I opened the box, took a bite and was disappointed! Not only the meat portion was very small (for a $14 dish!) but also where was the braised lamb that was supposed to be juicy and flavorful? The lamb was dry and tough! The chicken was steamed and had no flavor at all, bland. The only silver lining about the $30 I spent on these disappointing meal was the merely smoky rice (was not a full smoky flavor) and somewhat-spicy chilly sauce/salsa. I was rooting for this bussiness to bloom but if I would be getting an overpriced bland tough meat that had a ratio of 1:5 to the amount of rice was given...then I contemplated to come back."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma sandwich and side of hummus.   Atmosphere: I actually liked that there is a lot of space inside. If it was busier I could imagine still being able to have a conversation without too much ambient noise. Our table was covered with a cheap sheet of plastic which felt a little low-class compared to a tablecloth or even just leaving the table bare.   Food: the chicken shawarma was good, the fries were fine. The hummus was fine but the pita bread left something to desire."}
{"text":"Most tender chicken I've ever eaten. Fell right off the bone...literally. We got the chicken khalsab(?) and mandi lamb. Both were delicious. Arabian music added to the ambience. Servers were very friendly and accommodating. Portions were huge, good value for the price. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best saudi arabian food and best price I have ever sern before, also they have a hooka lounge at the same store it's extremely cheaper than other hooka store. I recommend this restaurant for ever."}
{"text":"I was just at the Palm tonight. I have to say that the customer service I recieved was bar none the best ever! From the moment I walked in to the minute I left I wanted for nothing! I enjoyed the patio it was very warm and inviting. Beautiful tapestries great music and the dessert was amazing! I was there late but ill be back for dinner within the week.!! See ya soon Palm!!'"}
{"text":"Wow! At Palm Beach you will find amazing cuisine spanning multiple regions of the Middle East. The menu offers several dishes that you might not have seen before.   We stepped in with an Amazon deal for a three course meal. We decided on the dolma appetizer, and shared the kushari and chicken with rice. We finished with the om ali.  The dolma was freshly made, and oh so good, especially if all you are used to is the canned dolma from restaurants. The kushari was starch heaven, filled with pasta, lentils, rice, covered with a tangy tomato sauce, topped with caramelized onion. The chicken and rice came with your choice of 2 rices. We chose the smokey rice, which was excellent. I really enjoyed the smokey flavor of the rice with the tender, fall off the bone chicken.  The om ali was a unique dessert to me. It is a puff pastry soaked in cream, topped with crushed pistachio and baked in the oven. It tasted like the bread pudding version of puff pastry, and was thoroughly enjoyable.  Service was excellent, and the staff were all cheerful and helpful in guiding us through the menu.  The atmosphere is a little hit and miss. The walls are beautifully decorated, but the tables and chairs are quite Spartan, with cut up clear plastic bags being used as tablecloths.  Overall though, a great place to dine.  P.S. All their meat is halal, and they have quite a few vegetarian options to choose from."}
{"text":"Palm Beach Middle Eastern has so many faults that it is hard to see how it can rate even three stars, but read on.  To start with, Palm Beach is located in a less-than-busy strip mall (at least on Saturday evening), and I can only describe as \"creepy\" the feeling I had getting out of my car.  A hookah lounge (connected with the restaurant it turns out) was right in front of me complete with an \"interesting\" man leaning on the wall.  Entering the restaurant felt like entering a cave.  The space is huge with 16 tables scattered around.  They could easily have 50.  There is nothing else in the room.  When we were there only one other table was occupied.  Still feeling \"creepy\".  The lone waitress was dressed appropriately for -- well, actually she wasn't dressed appropriate for anything.  The menu was far too large, but don't worry -- they had taped over about half of the offerings.  And something I have never seen before -- the silverware (spoon, fork, knife) came with each piece individually wrapped in a napkin.  Odd.  Could it get any worse?  I am happy to say: \"no\".  From that point on, if we tried hard to ignore our surroundings, Palm Beach delivered a reasonable and occasinally exemplery meal.  The waitress was friendly and competent, the food came out reasonably quickly (although the appetiser and main courses were served almost simultaneously).  And some of the food was really good -- the baba ghonouj, for example.  The smoky rice chicken was well prepared but it was simply a half roasted chicken on a bed of rice.  Tasty but simple.  The okra-lamb stew was also simple, but not so tasty, and the lamb chunks were chewy.  As an example of middle eastern cooking, Palm Beach has some potential, at least when you learn what to order, but you will have to get over the negatives if you want to enjoy your meal.  We couldn't."}
{"text":"Pros: the food taste is really good The food is fresh  Cons: they took long time to bring the food"}
{"text":"So my fiancé and I came in for lunch and we didn't like it very much. We love middle Eastern food but this wasn't very good. It took 10min to get our drinks (mind were the only people there on a Friday afternoon). Then we ordered a appetizer and they did have really good hummus and dolmas. However when my fiancé got his food he took 2 bites and explained to the server that it had way to much spice in the rice. They did apologize and deduct it, which was nice. Also, we never got a refill. And the server would be talking to us and just walk away in the middle of a sentence.  We most likely will not come back but hopefully we just went there on an off day and they really are what the yelp reviews say they are."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Not typical kabobs. They offer a variety of saudi based dishes.  The lamb is scrumptious and the okra stew w lamb was amazing.  I highly recommend this place."}
