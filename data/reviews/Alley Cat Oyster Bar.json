{"text":"Went on a very busy Saturday night. Reservation was for 8:30pm. They could only initially seat is outside and it was slightly too cold to sit out there. 20 minutes later we were seated. Menu offers some good options, but nothing overly unique that is not already offered in bigger cities.  Ordered ceviche appetizer and was disappointed to find very small quantity of fish. It was overrun by tomatoes and avocados. For dinner I got the seared yellow fin tuna.  Good flavor overall, complemented with ponzu sauce. It didn't wow me, but was ok.  Service was average, maybe a little slower as they are still trying to figure things out. Location was fantastic on the east bank. No  rush to make it back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Menu was unique and interesting but the lobster roll was just average.  The bun was barely toasted and the lobster was under dressed.  Plenty of lobster but not much flavor.  Lobster slider at Pier W is WAY better.   Service was less than average and they weren't very busy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. It's really good for Cleveland. A beautiful new building right on the river on the east bank of the flats. Really nice boardwalk highlights the outside. Inside there is a nice and busy bar. Unfortunately the food was below average and the drinks were terrible. I had the crispy whole fish and my guest had the lobster roll. We started with oysters. Very disappointing on all fronts. Zach Bruell should be able to get this right, but it's not there yet. I will return in the summer for cocktails outside on the deck. But I won't be returning for dinner anytime soon. I recommend Blue Point Grill for oysters or Zach's Parallax for seafood"}
{"text":"Oysters were terrific, ate at the bar.  Then, our server/bartender cut her finger somehow.  We noticed the blood and offered her a bandage.  Another server interrupted and said no thanks as they have it taken care of - protocol, right?  Nope. She put a towel on it for a min then kept making drinks with blood dripping offer her finger. Totally disgusted, we told the manager and got up to leave.  Manager apologized and credited our meal and even offered a free one which we declined as it seemed difficult to think of coming back any time soon.  It was a disgusting experience in a beautiful place with great food.  Better order drinks in a bottle though......when we left the worker was still mixing drinks and serving. That whole bar area should have been closed and disinfected first."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed lunch on first visit. Great service, fantastic view of frozen river and gulls, and absolutely delicious dish. Charred broccoli Caesar salad with grilled salmon. Perfectly cooked and generous serving of broccoli, nice creamy Caesar dressing and perfectly cooked salmon. Unique and welcome diversion from a lettuce salad."}
{"text":"Unless you're a snobby douche looking to throw away money on sub par seafood, don't waste your time or money here. The ceviche contained neither ceviche nor ceviche. Wait staff just as snobby as the customers. Never again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Shrimp and grilled cheese sandwhich. It came out fast, with NO shrimp. I told this to the bartender who served me right away and she stated it was shrimp paste, not shrimp. This would have been fine if there was actually shrimp paste on it, but there was none of that either, just butter soaked bread and slaw!!  A few minutes later my friend went to order the shrimp poe boy and a different bartender told her they had been out of shrimp, so basically the bartender lied to my face and didn't take care of my order when she should have or their $15 shrimp and grilled cheese is grilled cheese sans shrimp."}
{"text":"Atmosphere 5/5 Food 4/5 Service 3/5   Atmosphere Location is fantastic. No matter where you are seated, inside or outside, you can still enjoy the great view and experience the outdoors because all the massive garage doors open. Decor is minimal and industrial, but most likely so it doesn't detract from the view.   Food Good, but not great.   Clam Chowder -- Delicious! Loved the corn and carrots.  Baked Oysters -- I personally found them to be kind of bland and flavorless. Was it the oysters or the accompaniments? I couldn't tell ya! Would not order them again and would not recommend.  Ceviche -- Really good this one, and very different from other ceviches I have had. It was a salmon ceviche and loaded with veggies--heirloom tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion. The veggies were a really nice touch. Definitely need a perfectly composed bite with this one.  Snap Pea and Parmesan Salad -- Pretty good and unique. Crunch overload between the snap peas and marcona almonds.  Lobster Roll -- Good.. but I've had better. On the smaller side as well. The roll is topped with shaved celery. The celery provided some much needed crunch to a traditionally \"softer\" dish. The roll definitely could have used more lobster. I'd say it was 1/3 lobster and 2/3 celery. Not okay.  Coconut Cheesecake -- Delicious! Must try. Instead of serving you a slice, it's shaped like a halved sphere.    Service Service was by no means bad--server was nice, water glasses were never empty, etc. Service was just simply informal and and a bit incorrect.  For example, when pouring our bottle of wine, our server took our glasses off the table and held them in her hand. That's a serving no no.   By the end of our meal, our table was a bit messy. There were drops of water, little bits of food and crumbs, and sweat spots from our drinks. No one ever came to give the table a quick wipe. When our server brought over the dessert menus (which happened to be paper), she simply placed them right on top of the mess. Yikes.   Will probably return at some point, but it's not high up on the list."}
{"text":"I felt as if I were transported out of Cleveland without leaving the 216 area code!   1. Location: Alley Cat has the monopoly on the waterfront. The open air venue and the industrial decor allow the guest to appreciate the history of the flats while elevating it to modern day. What a treat to enjoy the sun setting over the water as boats motor past!  2. Service: Let me begin by stating that we dined here their first week in operation. It is terribly difficult, I am sure, to get a restaurant up and running. It takes time to work out some kinks and get everyone on the same page. However, our server Katelynn was a dream. She greeted us with a warm smile and immediately went into describing the oyster selections. She continued by expanding on the specials of the day and some changes that had been made to the existing menu. She checked in after each course was delivered to ensure we enjoyed everything.   3. Food: We ordered our cocktails and they arrived promptly. (Have Jillian make an Old Fashioned! Yum). Fried Calamari was our first course. I couldn't get enough of the preserved lime. Watch out for the kimchi salad - HOT. My boyfriend loved it. Second course included two appetizers and an entree which we rotated between. Little neck clams in old bay butter were a lovely costal standard. The ceviche included halibut and ahi tuna served with 3 tostones. I would have liked a few more tostones as the amount of ceviche you received was plentiful. Luckily they are available to order as a side! Since we had our fill of seafood we tried the green papaya salad with roasted chicken and Thai-lime vinaigrette. YUM! Served cold, it's exactly what you would expect from the menu description. We finished dinner with the chocolate terrine. I would return for that alone if nothing else as I have quite the sweet tooth.   Give Alley Cat a shot. I guarantee there's something to enjoy for everyone!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks and apps. The shrimp stuffed peppers were really good- had a little spice to it and very tasty."}
{"text":"Location is excellent but food is mediocre; salty soups, over cooked fish and fries that you can get at any bbq joint.  I hope they keep working at it.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great service but the menu can be misleading. Patio is beautiful on a nice night and the candles prevent too many bugs. Happy hour Thursday offering different from what's posted but still good. The oysters, stuffed shrimp, and salads very good."}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time and wouldn't go back. Great location but the food was not good. I had the seafood quesadilla, I couldn't even taste any seafood.  I opened it up to see how much was inside, I saw maybe one piece of calamari and a few shrimp, it was mostly cheese.  The quesadilla came with guacamole, all it was, was mashed avocados with no seasoning.  In my book that's not guacamole, it's just mashed avocado.  My husband had the perch sandwich and it was mostly bun, not fish, also with no seasoning/flavor and the fries were cold. It's a shame, I hoped for better."}
{"text":"One star for the view, which is nice. The food is bland, unimaginative, and mostly terrible (like really how could you mess this up terrible), the noise level is very difficult, and when we asked for a quieter table we were moved to a remote, oddly lit glassed in area near the lively deck/bar scene, which might be where the private events are held, and is where several tables sat in mostly ignored limbo. But bad food is bad food, no matter where you sit. There's lots of other options nearby: I would suggest that you try one of those out."}
{"text":"Delicious and very fresh food, amazing views, great service - Alley Cat is definitely a worthwhile stop if you're down in the flats. We had a delicious \"snack brunch\" of ceviche and mimosas, but honestly the best part about Alley Cat is just sitting out in the sun, watching the ships and people go by."}
{"text":"Food is good. I ordered the mussels and the oysters as appetizer and love it! (Good taste, amount, reasonable price)   However I did not quite like the main dish I ordered , the fish with cauliflower ( I forgot the name, but it was the catch of the day for that day) the fish costs 34$.. But the taste is not that impressive.   The location and ambiance is really nice. But it is hard to find parking at the Flat.. The nearby parking is expensive (my opinion)  Another thing is that there is only one bathroom with a long wait time."}
{"text":"If you want a vibrant, noisy venue overlooking the Cuyahoga River with mediocre food and indifferent service, this is the place for you. The location,  in Cleveland's Flats is choice for a summer evening, but its design causes sound to echo. This isn't the place for a quiet or romantic meal. The waitress was friendly in a barmaidly kind of way. The craft draft beer I ordered, she told me, had a frozen line--in July--and was not available. Her suggestion was a Miller Lite, hardly a substitute. We never came up with a suitable alternative. She then pushed raw oysters on us, in July. My friend commented on the oyster season being months with an \"r\" and she said, \"oh, they fly them in.\" He said, \"from another month, with an \"r\" in it?\" but that comment flew over her head. You can tell it's a Zach Buell restaurant from the side dishes. They seem to be the same at all of his restaurants, and they're hit or miss. Jalapeno cheese grits doesn't strike me as a good companion to fish.The gazpacho was heavy with cumin and cayenne and stripped the skin from my lips. The lobster roll was boring, boring!  All in all, I would go for a drink at the bar and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great views and location.  Good valet parking.  The menu lists all sorts of oysters but to our dismay, the waiter told us that they \"try to have 3 of them on any given day\" So why would the menu list all sorts of oysters that they don't have on a regular basis?  The couple at the next table also didn't like this unpleasant surprise.  The wait staff lacks direction, training and management.  All of four of us ordered salads-- 3 iceberg wedges and 1 house salad-- but one was served 7-8 minutes before the others arrived.  No mention of why or when they were bringing the rest, we just sat and waited. We had the stuffed oysters and  the three other types of oysters that were available.  The stuffed oysters are basically breadcrumbs not at all \"like Oysters Rockefeller\" as the waiter indicated.    When we made our reservation, we inquired about vegetarian options for one in our party and were assured that they regularly deal with this request.  At this time of the year when there are plenty of fresh vegetables at local farm markets, you would think that they could have at least one option--if you are a vegetarian avoid this place, they don't know what to do.  The only option was the seafood quesadillas without the seafood-- which aren't an entree but a small plate.  The salmon was cooked properly, but it's served as a hunk of fish surrounded by sauce and the garnish which are really odd tasting.  Someone needs to go over the menu and check out the seasonings.  Only really good entree was the lobster roll and the fries which were quite tasty.    The waiter left in the middle of our meal and we didn't see anyone for 30 minutes, finally a waitress came over and told us that she was taking over our table since he had to leave.  We had to wave down staff to refill our glasses--no one was paying attention to our table or those near us.   Most of the staff spends its time waiting in front of the kitchen for dishes.     We won't be returning.  This restaurant needs to train its wait staff and review its menu.  Judging from comments from nearby tables, we weren't the only disappointed diners."}
{"text":"We went for brunch recently and found the restaurant lackluster. We found the service to be attentive, but there was an attitudinal distance about the staff. Our waiter was nice, but the remaining staff all seemed to want to be elsewhere. They performed as expected though.   The food was underwhelming for the prices. My family is not averse to spending money on a good meal but we didn't even finish. I ordered the salmon plate and it was candied or cured. It tasted ok but it made me wonder if they had to cure it because they don't sell enough. My husband got the grilled octopus and it was swimming in sauce,  which wasn't described on the menu. Everything seemed over salted or seasoned or dressed.   Anyway decide for yourselves just as we did. It was a $100+ gamble which we were willing to take, but others might prefer not to take such a risk. We enjoy ZB restaurants but this one lacks in ways his other restaurants excel."}
{"text":"We know it is difficult to find good workers  Mike, one of the managers, greeted our party of 3 at the door. We were promptly seated for this late afternoon Sunday dinner.   We were given a special corner table close to the river with the flowers I ordered in advance displayed as requested. The serving staff were divided into 3: the water and bread bearer, the waitress (ours for this evening was Hallie) and a man who brought our food who did not identify himself.   Two of us , siblings but not twins, had birthdays on the very same day but our waitress, Hallie, seemed to take no interest in that. And when she got our salad order wrong, failing to put dressings on the side, she apologized. You might say that she was not engaged, not particularly interested in the persons she was serving.  The water bearer only came by refill glasses when the check was delivered and one of our party had given up, parched as he.  The food bearer was sullen: no smile or normal human gestures. Not even the usual, \"Enjoy!\" To all of us, he seemed annoyed to have to be doing this.   I thought the food was good but not great. The crab cake was very good and the accompanying greens very yummy. This crab cake was almost as good as what I had in Annapolis some years earlier. The house salads were nice but not special. My swordfish was dried out, desiccated. It was surrounded by a very delicious slaw of sorts that compensated for what they had done to this piece of fish.   My wife's halibut was moist and excellent. The third person in our party had the tuna and the charred broccoli salad and the clam chowder soup. He is fairly critical, and said all were okay. I did not taste any of those.   Mike stopped by to check on us but neither Hallie nor the food bearer ever asked how things were during our entire stay.   Two of us who are key lime pie aficionados judged the single piece of key lime pie we shared to be good perhaps 6.5 out of a possible 10.   Our green tea was nice and hot.   We had more dessert waiting for us at home.  We would probably come back here eventually but the main drawback here is the staff.  As I said, I know, it is difficult to get good workers."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food was not worth the price. It's a tourist trap. Also tried to serve us wine that was a different year than on their menu. Turns out they didn't have the listed year in any of their wines. Avoid this place go to Blue point instead."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant with all the buzz about The Flats revival! I was a little skeptical at first reading the reviews, but kept an open mind because it's a brand new establishment that needs time to iron out the kinks.  I highly suggest Alley Cat if you're looking to step away from the typical Cleveland scene dining in Ohio City and Tremont. Also, if you have guests in town or clients to wine and dine. The view and atmosphere is the selling point, absolutely beautiful! It's right on the water, you can watch barges go by and enjoy all of the surrounding city lights. After dinner, there's a new dueling piano bar (Big Bang) that's in walking distance that would be fun to check out.  Most importantly, our server was very friendly, attentive and offered her suggestions without being aggressive. My friend ordered the Crab Cake and the Snap Pea & Shaved Parmesan Salad and loved it. I was a little disappointed with the Grilled Octopus, it was slightly overcooked, nothing terrible - the succotash and the smoked paprika aioli made up for it. The drinks were awesome, too. I had the One Love cocktail and my friend had the Elderflower Fizz, both recommended.  Overall a wonderful experience. Managers checking on you, servers asking your opinions and reasonable menu pricing. I think this place will be a hit once they capture their bearings."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Really cool vibe on the water.  My wife and I had a bunch of appetizers. Try the shrimp stuffed peppers and the ceviche.  The Irish point oysters were perfect.  We split the lobster roll and a really unique snap pea salad.  Service was really good.  We were in and out quickly. We will be back."}
{"text":"I reviewed Alley Cat last summer (8/10/2016) and stated that, although I only gave it 3 stars, we'd give it another shot if we were in the area. Well we did (4 of us) and I'm sorry-it only got worse. On the bright side, the oysters are great although they could be a bit more generous with the toppings when you order a dozen as we did. The bad news is that WE WERE NEVER SERVED OUR DINNER! The kitchen somehow lost our orders and we had to leave for a concert. (We'd waited to be served our entrees for 45 minutes and asked for updates 2x before we were told the bad news.) Our server was very apologetic, especially when we told the manager we'd like our 1 round of drinks and the oysters comped. He said he'd comp only the oysters, not the drinks. REALLY? Our server must have changed the manager's mind because the credit card was returned uncharged. As we left hungry the server came running after us with one of the orders in a to-go box. She really did feel awful.  I should mention that one of our party has eaten at Alley Cat a few times and has never had a bad experience. But for my husband and I-we're done. Thank goodness there were hot dogs for sale at the concert."}
{"text":"Location is fantastic! Great views of everything on the water. We had a large group of 16, and Katelynn gave us great service from start to finish.  Everyone's food was delicious. We started with a variety of apps...oysters, calamari, mussels, beef tartar. All of the entrees and desserts were great as well. I recommend the key line pie with coconut ice cream."}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the first time. Reservations were for 8:15 and didn't get dinner until 10... When the food did come out, it was obvious some of the meals had been sitting out for a very long time. There was a large party upstairs, but still no excuse. The drinks were really good and the food was alright. Overall an OK experience, but I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Typical Zach restaurant. The experience was fantastic. From the friendly faces at the door to Johnny from Chinato behind the bar. The signature cocktails and wine list leave nothing to the imagination. And then there is the food. You wouldn't know that it just opened!!!!  Fantastic experience all around."}
{"text":"This week was my second and last attempt to eat at Alley Cat. My first dinner was in February for my 50th birthday, as well as my nieces 25th. We were a table of 8. The service was unfriendly and our waitress seemed uninterested in serving us. I tried an entree of fish cheeks prepared in an Asian broth. The fish cheeks were tough and the broth had a significant amount of grit on the bottom of the bowl, probably from bok choy. The manager came by to see how things were and I told him how I felt. He took my uneaten plate, offered to get me something else, but my party had already finished, so I passed. He left it on the bill.   My sister and I recently went back because we could sit outside. Our drinks were good. The food was terrible. She had the seafood salad and I had the clams and also the pea salad. All of our plates looked like they mixed our dishes directly in our bowls. They were a mess. Food all over the sides, top and outside. The pea salad was over dressed and had too many ingredients...feta and Parmesan covered up any pea flavor. The clams were the toughest I've ever eaten. My sisters fish salad didn't taste fresh and there was nothing interesting about it at all. I expected so much more as I've been to all other ZB restaurants. Won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"Wanted to check out the new waterfront development on the flats. Went for happy hour 4-6 so we didn't try the regular menu but the apps were pretty good like the Latin fries. Enjoyed the oyster bar. Outside seating is scenic buy happened to rain when we ate there. It's really great to finally see the city take advantage of the riverfront. Hopefully the development will expand to the lake."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but overpriced ok food. The happy hour Margarita is not your typical Margarita. It took everything out of me to slug it down. Blackened grouper was drowning in lobster cream sause. Did not finish. Hope it gets better because it is in a prime location!"}
{"text":"First time in the Flats  we ate at Alley Cat.  Awesome food, GREAT oysters.  Well Done Alley Cat."}
{"text":"I would be hard pressed to be more impressed by the food (with the caveat it is seafood in the midwest). I shared appetizers; calamari, shrimp, mussels and steamed clams.  Reasonable proportions, but not suburban American super-sized. All cost $10-15 from what I remember. The calamari is the best I have had in 20 years and I have a had a lot in between those times. The other dishes were excellent although I have had their equivalent on the coasts, but not many that were clearly better.    I went on a Sunday night.  It was busy and the service was not terrible but not excellent either.  I am more impressed by food than service, hence my 5 stars. The location on the river is very nice.  I enjoyed a beer on the roof deck, bar but didn't look like they had food up their yet.  The cover band at Shooters across the river, not so much. I am going back in less than a week to let you know how good I thought it was."}
{"text":"The setting automatically gives it 5 stars.  It just opened this week, and (almost) everything we had was awesome.  The best things we had were the Perch sandwich and the seafood quesadillas.  Definitely sit outside!"}
{"text":"Oh man, I really don't like giving out bad reviews, but this place could use some work!! The hostess seemed down right annoyed at our presence, and our server was barely better. We ordered the calamari and it was painfully under cooked. I ordered the house mojito (a mojito with cucumber) and there was almost no ice, and the mint leaves had just been dumped in without any sort of muddling. This basically made the drink taste like a warm cucumber soaked in rum. I had the crab cake as an entree and it was soggy in the middle and didn't taste exactly fresh. I do give one star for a great view and one star for prompt service, even though a second drink was requested by someone else in our party and it never came."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for dinner there is eight of us four of us ordered the grilled octopus which was terrible hard as a rock and all they would do about the situation was offered us two free dessert spend about $800 and I'm not going back"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the waterfront/flats.   Service was prompt but a little confusing as we dealt with at least 4 different servers. The drinks were refreshing though the ice was a little generous. The food was promptly prepared and tasty (esp the clam chowder). Our experience overall was good but the location was the most memorable part."}
{"text":"OK. The new East Bank of the Flats has recently added a number of new dining options to explore. We decided to try Alley Cats Oyster Bar. If your looking for a Flats bar to bulk up on bar food and down beers don't go. But if you want to savor some of Cleveland's latest in the culinary arts, Alley Cats should be a must stop on your dining experience bucket list. Between the three of us we shared the Shrimp Stuffed Peppers ( a spicy kick but well worth ordering off the appetizer list) along with a sampling of Blue Point oysters. Tasty!  The sharing didn't stop because each dish each of us ordered just begged to be sampled just based on the presentation alone. Chili braised beef, Mexican Chopped Seafood Salad and Grilled Octopus, all exceptional, with each offering an enjoyable melange of flavors. No wonder Zac Bruell is one of Cleveland's culinary stars.  Our waitress Samantha was friendly and helpful and her suggestion for topping it all off with Key Lime pie was unanimously accepted.  Since it was a rainy Tuesday night we can't wait until summer to return take in more of the open air fun at riverside as well as the food."}
{"text":"Anniversary dinner. We had only heard glowing reviews, maybe that was the problem? It's like a movie people say you \"gotta see!\" and when you see it you think \"Oh that was ok\". Disclosure, neither of us like oysters. Overall it was Good. Location and service were both solid (there were some unfriendly hostesses that we can forget about). It was hustling even for a Wednesday night, and you have the best river views in CLE. Once we were seated there were bugs EVERYWHERE at/around our table. I kept having to pick fruit flies out of my wine, gross. Probably not something they can control very well being indoor/outdoor. App: We split shrimp stuffed poblano peppers - spicy and flavorful, loved! Entrees: I thought my lobster roll was delicious. It came with an entire half plate of fries though, which I thought was overkill - would be nice with slaw or a small salad. My hubby didn't like his salmon entree at all. It was dished up with some bland consommé, and needed a thicker sauce.  It was salmon in a puddle. Dessert: The chocolate terrain was good. Other things to note: There are at least a dozen other spots in the flats to eat/drink now, so you can feel some energy there again  Will def go back to give it another go."}
{"text":"Food is decent, although nothing I'll crave.  I've had better oysters and seafood elsewhere in Cleveland.  Out of our party of 8 nobody left impressed, yet nobody left disappointed in their food.  But the indoor seating is troublesome.  The upstairs area is cold and sterile.  The downstairs is mainly dining in the bar area...and that's a problem.  The clientele on this particular night was the typical baseball cap, jäger-bomb shooting, loud crew that killed the flats 13 years ago.  And there were lots of them.  I can deal with that  setting for exceptional food, or I can eat mediocre food in a classier setting.  But this was mediocre food in a lousy setting.  I'll go again in the summer when the jersey shore crowd has more space to separate itself, but I can't recommend it year round."}
{"text":"Beautiful location and ambiance. Terrible service. Our oysters and entree where wrong and dinner took 3 hrs. We were literally abandoned by our server. Overpriced and terrible service."}
{"text":"Love this location, mostly because of its location and views. Located in the Flats right on the river, Alley Cat provides lunch and dinner views that are hard to rival anywhere else in Cleveland. Heck, even LeBron James loves this place enough to flash the championship trophy here from the upstairs balcony.  The menu is somewhat expected, with a focus on their oysters. Personally, I am not an oyster fan, but rather a fish and other seafood fan. I really enjoyed the Grouper Cheeks, even though they may be on the pricier side. Their fish sandwich is one of their least expensive items (around $15 or so) that many people actually enjoy also. But as expected, couple a dish here with a drink or an appetizer and you get yourself a pretty heavy bill.  I really think this place is worth checking out because of the views alone. The food is pretty good, and I have had no issues with service on the several occasions I dined here. I have showed up both with a reservation and without, and each time have had no issues whatsoever. Give this place a shot and enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"Nice patio, good food, good drinks. Nice to have an oyster bar in Cleveland where you don't see many like it. Would be a great spot in the summer"}
{"text":"A nice seat on the water with very medicocre food and a reservation policy that encourages open tables while people wait hours to sit.    Essentially Alleycat is a swing and a miss. The food is derivative but nicely presented. The burger was \"leaky\" for being medium but the fries we're excellent.  We sat at the bar due to a two hour wait (with at least 7 tables open for the 2  hours we were there)   The servers knew absolutely nothing about oysters. Simple questions about size, salinity and sweetness were met with confusion which was very disappointed.   The burger was decesnt but not cooked to orde (rarer than ordered). The shrimp spread on it was tasteless (thought they forgot it at first). The oysters were nicely presented but werent that good.   Drinks were appropriately priced.     WHY IS THEIR WAIT TWO HOURS WHEN TABLES REMAINED OPEN FOR THE ENTIRE 2 HOURS WE WERE THERE???!!!!!   The ambience is nice. It's the perfect location the type of place you'd like to see on the river.    Valet is $12  Wouldn't recommend. Might be back. Needs some work."}
{"text":"We decided to go early (around 5 pm) for the the happy hour. We ended up sitting on the upper deck outside; we were forewarned there would be a somewhat limited menu, but there were ample choices. The view was nice, but it was kind of noisy due to there being live bands across the channel at both the Music Box and Shooters. My wife ordered a gin and tonic; I was taken aback when it came, as it was probably the smallest cocktail I have ever seen served at a bar. I ordered something called the Cat's Pajama's, described as \"Our House-made Lemonade with Tito's Handmade Vodka.\" It cost $11, but arrived in a small plastic cup. The lemonade tasted like a watered down mix, and I could hardly taste the vodka. So much for the drinks. We ordered a shrimp cocktail that was actually pretty tasty, but spendy ($20) for just five shrimps.  We each ordered the lobster roll as an entree. It, too, was tasty, but came with home made potato chips that were unimaginative and somewhat stale. All told, the meal came to $86. Add to that a 20% tip and parking ($10 plus a few bucks tip), and we were at over $100. Honestly, I am happy to pay that for a really good meal at an upscale restaurant, but this was not at all that kind of experience. I would not go back any time soon. For whatever it's worth, my wife thought it was better than I did."}
{"text":"I met some former co-workers at Alley Cat tonight at Alley Cat. I love Zach Bruell's other restaurants, especially L'Albatros and Chinato, so I was looking forward to trying his latest venture. Lets just say I wasn't impressed.   The place was very busy.  We checked earlier in the week and they didn't have any reservations open so we took our chance hoping to get a seat on the patio (they don't take reservations on the patio). No tables available, but we were able to get a table inside which was great, but It would have been nice to have been seated somewhere other than across from the men's room.   Our server and the gentleman filling water and bread were very attentive. I ordered the grilled octopus, too bad I didn't read the reviews first because it was a mistake. The sauce and garnish were great but the octopus itself was over-cooked. Now that I read the other reviews I wish I would have said something to the server, but now that I think about it he didn't come back to check on us so I didn't even have the opportunity to say anything about it. Strike one and two.    We finished our meals our server cleared our dishes and asked if we wanted anything else.  We were busy talking so we said not right now, but after a few minutes our server came back with our checks.  Once we got our checks we commented to one another that we would have liked to have stayed for another drink, but it seemed like he wanted us to go We were only there for about 1.5 hours so it's not like we were lingering, but we just decided to pay our check and go.  A missed opportunity for an additional sale. Strike three.  They're new so I'll give them another shot, but they better get their act together overall, and on this menu item...seems like a lot of unhappy octopus diners."}
{"text":"absolutely awful service!!! took over an hour to get appetizers..even longer for main course. took 30 mins to get a beer. food is not bad but service and atmosphere are not good at all. got here at 8:30 didn't leave till 11 because of slow service. came here to celebrate a birthday and was extremely disappointed. very sad could be a good place"}
{"text":"Our server was Vienna. Before coming here I read all the reviews on how horrible alley cats was, the food, etc, so when my friend and I came, we came somewhat biased. The alley cats was busy at the time but we managed to get our food promptly. Vienna helped us out tremendously and suggested food to us. She was very helpful. The food was delicious.  Since there were negative reviews on the grilled octopus, I managed to get that as my entree to see what all the fuss was about.  Let me just say, this was the best grilled octopus I've had to date. It was not chewy, in fact, it had a meaty consistency. Raw sushi octopus is chewy, this was not. We also had oysters which were delicious and refreshing. Yes, there were little tiny chips of shell but it wasn't even a big deal, I literally felt them twice and that was it. We also had baked oysters which were delicious and rather cheesy. For our drinks, Vienna recommended the elder fizz martini...to die for. Get that if you get the chance. They serve bread and oil for a little appetizer. If you also get the chance, request Vienna as your server, she's very personable and such a sweetheart. The manager came over and talked to us askIng how the service was which was pretty cool. I recommend this place. And they just opened so cut it some slack. The food and service is great."}
{"text":"I came to Alley Cat with my sister on a busy Friday night, and it is as good as it gets! We made a reservation via open table and hung out at the bar while we waited for our table to open up. We had a delightful experience. We ordered various cocktails, all equally as tasty. Our bartender had a good sense of humor and did an excellent job staying aware of his guests at the bar, even though he appeared to be extremely busy. In terms of food, I ordered the Calamari to start and the Seafood Quesadilla as my entrée. Both were AWESOME. I will be craving that quesadilla all the time now! Mike, the manager, stopped at our table to assure that we were completely satisfied...and we were! We informed him that we were from out of town and he suggested places we might want to stop and see after our dinner. Two thumbs up! Alley Cat deserves an A+ and I will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad Cleveland has finally done something with the awesome water front property that was spent wasted ever since the flats' heyday ended many years ago.  And what better place to go right on the water than an oyster bar.  My parents were in town visiting and they love oysters, so I thought what better way to show them the beautiful waterfront while enjoying some oysters.  This place fills up quick so be sure to make reservations. We made reservations for a Thursday evening and glad we did because it was full.  We were immediately seated at what looked like the best seat, right next to the water.  We got there just before sunset so the views were amazing right from our seats (see picture).  We started off with some drinks, wine and beer. Service was quick and server was very friendly.  For appetizers, we ordered the oysters, they had three different types that night, and the shrimp stuffed peppers (which we were told was Bruell's favorite).  I personally do not eat oysters so can't say how they tasted, but can only go by everyone else's word and everyone who did eat them thought they were fantastic.  The stuffed peppers were delicious, perfect amount of spice in every bite.  For dinners my mom and I ordered the tuna, which came slightly seared and sliced into pieces. It was perfectly cooked (or not cooked), each bite had that perfect velvety smooth texture that I love so much in tuna.  I also ordered a side of hush puppies.  The order was big enough to share with the table. The hush puppies were some of the best I have ever had and they came with a creamy sauce for extra flavor (don't remember what was in the sauce).  My boyfriend ordered the pork steak.  When the server brought out his plate, we thought he was bringing enough food for the table. The steak was huge, the size of someone's head, it also came with cream corn and fingerling potatoes. He really loved the dish, I thought the steak was a little tough, but I am not a big fan of steaks, so take his word. The serving was actually so big he took about half of it home and we snacked on it the next day. The cream corn and potatoes were fantastic.  My dad ordered two appetizers, the mussels and the shrimp cocktail. I didn't try either, but he absolutely loved both of them, especially the mussels.  He kept talking about them the next day saying how delicious they were and also couldn't believe how many mussels came in the dish.  And lastly, we ordered dessert, rice custard creme brulee, one for the table. I was not impressed with the dessert at all. I didn't like it, but I didn't realize it was pretty much just rice pudding (don't like rice pudding), it was cold and sweet. I guess I was just paying attention to the creme brulee part and had higher expectations. Everyone else in my party liked it just fine, but didn't think it was anything special.  This was a perfect place, on a perfect night for my parents last night in Cleveland. I got to show them what awesome locations and restaurants are in Cleveland and we all got to enjoy some wonderful food.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First night Alley Cat Oyster Bar is open to the public.  It's a very large space with prime riverfront real estate in the new East Bank development.   The whole river-side portion of this restaurant opens up to the boardwalk and river.  There is not a bad seat in the house.  The place was pretty packed considering there wasn't much advertisement for the actual opening date.  A short storm rolled in about halfway through our meal and added a bit more excitement.  Zack Bruell inspected each plate as it came out of the kitchen.  The formula here is similar to other Bruell restaurants.  Bread and oil (thicker slices with corn), prompt service, and a large menu.  The highlight of the menu is a long list of oysters but there are plentiful appetizers, entrees, and fresh catch selections.  There should be an option for everyone.  The clam chowder was creamy and packed with flavor.  The seafood quesadilla was what one would expect.  The grilled cheese was a carb overload and a bit too heavy for my taste.  I enjoyed the halibut entrée but some might be surprised by the Indian flavors present.  There were a few holes in the service and an accidental upcharge that was corrected.  Overall it was impressive for an opening night. I think this place will be a hit in the new Flats."}
{"text":"I solely went to Alley Cat because I read about the good views the restaurant has and true enough, great views and a great location. It was one of my first stops after landing in Cleveland and I got there just in time for happy hour, which allowed me the chance to divulge in some delicious oysters - Blue Point and Raspberry Point and have a yummy citrus sangria. There were a few other items on the happy hour menu that I wanted to divulge in (popcorn shrimp and fried oysters) but I was totally being Dora that day and didn't want to sit in any one place for too long. Definitely one of the best views of Lake Erie in the city."}
{"text":"My first visit during lunch was very disappointing as I  frequent other Bruel restaurants. Lobster roll was extremely dry and underseasoned. Fries were so salty they were almost inedible. The small lobster roll and two pints came to a pricy $40!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for months, and I finally made it. Well worth the wait. The food was amazing, and service was great. Even though we technically were not seated at the bar, our waitress gave us happy hour prices for drinks until 6. I started off with the Alley Cat Stuffed Oysters, which were to die for. So flavorful. But beware ... They rest on little mounds of salt, not extra breadcrumbs. Don't eat the mound of salt. I was torn for my entree between the lobster roll and the sea good quesadillas. I got the quesadillas, and I am so glad I did. (lobster roll is usually my \"go to\" seafood, so I moved on to something a little different). The serving size was huge, and I'm very happy that I have leftovers for work tomorrow. The quesadillas were so food, filled to the brim and came with 3 delicious sauces. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late (for me) dinner last night around 8:15ish.  Was pleasantly surprised to see the place pretty full for that time on a weeknight.  Love seeing so much activity around Cleveland these days!  The space is dark and cozy, with walls that open up onto the water, which would have been amazing on a warmer night.  I'm so glad there are more options now that take advantage of the river and lake views in Cleveland.  This will be a fantastic addition, and definitely on my short list of places to take out-of-towners.  We weren't super hungry, so we skipped the apps, but there were several that sounded intriguing.  I would love to come back and try that grilled broccoli Caesar.  I'm kind of disappointed that I ordered the seafood quesadilla because it was nothing special and now that I see all these Yelp photos of the other dishes I wish I had gotten something else!  My two dining companions had the perch sandwich and the surf and turf burger, and both were reportedly delicious.  My husband was especially pleased with how rare his burger was.  He always says \"as rare as you can make it\" and it's rarely as rare as he likes.  I thought the seasoning definitely took the fries from average to great.  However, the whole star of the show, better even than the view (to me), were the smoky pickled carrots on both of their sandwiches.  Wow!  Those were incredible!  I would buy a jar if they sold them, and order a bowl of just carrots next time if they'll let me.  Soooooo yummy.  Overall I was pleased with everything - the service, the food, and the atmosphere.  But when you have a big name attached to the restaurant you expect all of that, so it's not surprising.  However, even if I wasn't pleased, I would have given them 4 stars for the carrots alone."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was something to be desired. Had to ask multiple times for clean water glasses. Our reservation was for 430 and I was told it would be an additional 30 min for a patio table. There is a different menu for the patio vs 2nd floor vs restaurant. Happy hour pricing only good for south patio...the 3 table north patio by the bumping FWD club does not honor happy hour pricing. Happy hour includes only one choice or beer, red or white wine. This is my second time there and I was very disappointed.  I've been there 930 on a Friday and 430 on a Sunday.  The Friday experience was much better than the Sunday."}
{"text":"Setting is its best attribute as the views are nice and the interior is great as well. May be because the place was pretty empty but we had very friendly and attentive service. One letdown would be only 3 oyster varities and no west coast choices but the blue points we got were shucked nicely and I loved the mingonette. Shrimp stuffed peppers were a twist that I really liked, only wish they used bigger shrimp inside. The whole fish had good flavor with the vinaigrette but it was a little overdone itself. Overall I enjoyed the meal but maybe a little pricey for the quality of the food"}
{"text":"Should have known as soon as we walked in!  The people behind the desk seemed a bit overwhelmed.  I stepped up to the desk and looked at the girl behind the desk and it took a minute for her to even say hello.  I asked if possible, to sit outside or by a window.  She said it would be a bit of a wait and we agreed.  We were seated pretty quickly, but stuck in a corner and my view was the wall.  About 5 minutes later, others were seated in the location we requested.  We were served bread immediately, but waited 10 minutes before I had to ask someone to get our server.  The server waited on 2 tables next to us but never acknowledged we were there!  The bread we were served looked like it was left over from another table b/c the table next to us had pieces of bread that were bigger and didn't look like they were pinched off and discarded. We ordered the Fish and chips and the piece of fish was so greasy. After we picked off the breading, it was smaller than the size of a playing card. Really, for $15.00!  We asked for another, that they quickly brought us another but the same thing.  The cheese was not melted and the fish coating was greasy.  Our server was diplomatic but seemed to be a bit condescending.  We were never asked if we wanted refills for our drinks and we felt like we were stuck in a corner with minimal attention.  I have been to less popular restaurants ordering the same meal for less an received better food.  We expected the same attention and food quality as the others around us but it was a failure!  I will never return and hope others get better service and food quality."}
{"text":"There are many very fine restaurants in Cleveland. Regrettably, Alley Cat will never be one of them. I recently hosted there a dinner of five, including my sister and brother-in-law from Savannah. The evening left me embarrassed and apologetic. We waited a full 90 minutes between being seated and being served our first course. Though the salads were passable, the main course was simply unacceptable. The hush puppies we ordered were left on the table - cold and soggy - mostly uneaten. The oysters were a C-, one was good, one acceptable, the rest inedible. And a simple fish sandwich was served cold, with the bun still partially frozen. Really, the level of service and the quality of food was so poor we were shocked. If you must go to Alley Cat, have a drink, enjoy the beautiful view of the river, and then, be sure to go to any of Cleveland's very good restaurants for a fine meal. Just don't make the mistake of eating at Alley Cat."}
{"text":"This review is not in relation to the food or service. I've been several times and the food is good. This review is in relation to the rooftop bar and serving $9 - $13 dollar glasses of wine and martinis out of a plastic cup. Plastic wine glasses have their place in this world, they're called graduation parties when serving mass quantities of below mediocre wine. Stay classy Alley Cat."}
{"text":"Went with a group of twelve last night for an anniversary dinner. We'd never been there before, but decided to try it. So the good, the bad, and the ugly.  The service was great. Server was always available, polite, and willing to help. The location and scenery were great. We were lucky enough to be seated near the back with our table right by the window next to the River. Amazing! BUT THE FOOD SUCKED. Another reviewer said that Zack inspected every dish. Well, he must have taken Easter Week off. The menu itself is somewhat limited with the entree selection, but that could be acceptable if the meals were exceptionally tasty. They were not. Boring, tasteless, unimaginative. Some of the meals weren't even hot. Yuck! A side point: The restrooms are upstairs. Very deserted. Very uncomfortable. Carpeting covered  with pieces of trash. Bottom line: Good enough place if you want to drink yourself stupid, take in the marvelous views, and call it a night. But if you want a quality dinner that will make you wish you could come again soon, go to Blue Point. We will NOT be back to Alley Cat. What a shame."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Our server made great recommendations.  Everyone enjoyed the ceviche appetizer.  We sat at a table overlooking the river. The drinks are pricy, but what you would expect at a high end restaurant.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"We went for Zack Bruell Restaurant Week dinner.  My wife and I got different appetizers which were both too salty. The shrimp and pasta was ok. Desert was average. Overall I was very disappointed. Waitress was very friendly. I don't think I will be returning. There are way better places to eat in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I can not stop thinking about The Alley Cat . The whole experience here truly uplifted everyone's spirits ! We stopped in downtown Cleveland on the way home from a wedding and landed at the Alley Cat.  The menu alone incited so much excitement and it was so very difficult to decide what to order .  Very unique menu with a variety of exclusive options .   The  milieu of the restaurant was beautiful .  Open windows everyone had a view of  the water, and rooftop seating available .   The staff was social, even the people pouring water and bussing wanted to make sure we had everything we needed and were enjoying ourselves .   The drink menu was spectacular as well.  A solid bloody Mary ,  and the crowd favorite was the Alley Cat ! With a little jalapeno and loads of flavor !  The food. Oh the food . Both seafood and landfood lovers will be sure to find something exceptional and particular on the menu. The clam chowder soup was hearty and came topped with fresh chives . The baked oysters were delicious.  The beef tartar was fresh and the meat was tender . The charred broccoli Caesar salad was a fresh and welcomed take on a classic.  The halibut collar and scallops had awesome flavor profiles .  I would have appreciated a little more dressing on the Lobster roll , that being said the Lobster plentiful and fresh. Topped it all off with an amazing mango creme brulee and have been singing this restaurants praises ever since ! Please come to Buffalo, until then I will come to you !"}
{"text":"Easter Brunch 2018 - and couldn't have asked for anything better!!  Brunch includes a mimosa or bloody mary. The buffet is fantastic with so much variety - and of course the fresh oysters were amazing. The service was impeccable. The best brunch in Cleveland for us! Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was at a conference here for work and was highly impressed with the food and bar staff.  The restaurant was reserved for our conference, so it was quite a spread of foods and open bar.  Some really delicious options and helpful people.  Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. Drank a nice bottle of wine Armorone. I ordered the king crab and had the calamari for an appetizer. I wish I would have known the calamari was mostly all tenticals. So once the server realized we didn't barely eat it, he had the manager take it off our bill which we didn't even ask him to do. So that was nice. The kind crab is not worth the 60 bucks. I had better at pierW. I had to crack my own , it was sharp, and they didn't give me a side plate to put my shells in. My husband got the salmon, he wasn't to impressed but ate it. Also my friend got the mussels and loved them. We (my husband and i) really wanted to order mussels, but they said they could not do the broth without the bacon. That's the first place I ever tried to order mussels where they told us they couldn't do it without bacon . My husband and I don't eat pork so that was a bummer...... It was a decent place, really cool to sit by the water!!!! I don't think I'll be returning... and if I do, It's to just get drinks! good service from the server!"}
{"text":"Horrendous!  Completely inexcusable that a restaurant who's owner brags about opening so many restaurants previously would be so unorganized and incompetent.  The managers run around and do nothing to help the customer experience.  The restaurant is completely understaffed and I felt so bad for the overwhelmed staff who is there.  The restaurant isn't even serving food on the second floor yet and the kitchen is beyond there capacity.  This was my first visit to a  Zack Bruell restaurant and he should embarrassed.  He may be a master of hype but he's a horrible restauranteur."}
{"text":"We went there for restaurant week. Everyone had something different and it was all outstanding. The wait staff was exceptional.  We must have had 7 or 8 people taking care of us (party of 4). The views of the river were great. I was born in Cleveland and I have seen many deaths and rebirths of the Flats. I think someone finally got it right. If you have not been down to the Flats recently, then you need to go. And, put this on your list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Cane in for the brunch & the views... amazing!  They have a Bloody Mary bar, with fun ingredients and a great spicy  mix.  The brunch was fantastic, with omelette, and the best biscuits & gravy ever. There is a carving station, and oysters of course!!  Chef Glen created a serving station out of wood planks from past tables which is very cool!  The views even on a rainy day are filled with historic brides & buildings. For this California girl, Alley Cat capped off an amazing trip. Don't miss this place!"}
{"text":"Setting was amazing. Beautiful right on the river, and amazing decorations. The homemade lemonade drink with strawberry jalapeno was absolutely unbelievable - highly recommend for other dainty drinkers.   Food was a mixed bag....  Highly recommend Clam Chowder (light but slightly creamy with diced vegetables perfectly sized for a spoon), Oysters, along with the Catch of the Day. Both people who got Catches of the Day were very pleased.  I got the crab legs, and as a self-proclaimed crab connseour since the age of 12, these were very tasty, amazingly fresh and yummy, but for $60 and only one leg, I am thinking I'll go elsewhere for King Crab legs. I originally thought they were going to bring out another plate....  Lobster roll was very good, but there isnt a ton of meat, so be aware of this going into this order. Yummy, but lots of bread and french fries to distract from small amounts of yummy lobster.  This should go without saying, but someone in my group apparently missed the memo, that this is not a place for steaks. Stay away from the 55 dollar steak- it is a seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst experience. Well not even a experience. We were at a brewery get together and were refused service because we brought a outside beer in from the brewery get together and were told we were allowed to do so. A lady outside, who was snobby told us this and then found us in the restaurant and told the waiter to refuse to serve us! I have never been turned away for service! I am a professional and we were prepared to spend our hard earned money there. I will never go there again and also will tell my friends and coworkers to not go there and will never take my customers there like I have in the past for lunches and dinner. If you want to be treated like a child and then treated as a bad person, then go there!"}
{"text":"What a great dinning experience.. Had dinner with the family today and was good.. I had the grilled octopus which is a must try that's if you like octopus..Great atmosphere and staff is still learning the menu since they just opened.. A must try, a great addition to Cleveland and will def be back soon.!!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here on a whim on a Saturday evening...the weather was beautiful!  I was happy to hear upon arrival the patio had available seating and that should have been a warning. Beautiful weather plus open patio seating equals DANGER DANGER WILL ROBINSON.   Our service was as if we were a bother. The food times were super slow and forget getting a drink refill other than water, as there was a separate server refilling water.   Note that the patio has a limited menu. The food was ok. For oyster in the name, they were not the best and have had a lot better in Cleveland. The best item was the lobster roll.   The gorgeous view from the patio, watching the boats go by was amazing.  But the jury is still out if that alone can overcome the other short falls of our experience."}
{"text":"I'm always skeptical of trying restaurants right after they first open but man oh man was Alley Cat BOMB!  First off, it's in a BEAUTIFUL location with waterfront views, which was perfect for my scenic dining experience.  Second, our waitress was amazing.  She was friendly, helpful, and did a really great job ensuring my date and I were happy with our evening.  And lastly, the food is amazing.  We started with a selection of oysters which were fresh and our waitress did a really thorough job describing the different flavors we'd taste with each type.  The fried calamari was impressive as well, with a Japanese twist using kimchee.  I'm a huge octopus lover so my date and I shared the grilled octopus entree which was absolutely delicious, but the star of the meal was actually not seafood!  The chili braised beef takes first place!  WOW!  It was a very large, meaty portion, not to mention the fried plantains that garnished it were excellent!  A bottle of wine later and after all this food, unfortunately there was no more room left for dessert.  Next time I'm in Cleveland, I will definitely come back and leave a little extra room in my seafood-and-beef-filled-stomach for a sweet bite!"}
{"text":"I truly cannot give it more than two stars at this time and I'm being generous. Perhaps I might go back and try something and try something else, but only if someone invites me there. The fish tacos were the worst I have ever eaten. The tacos were Starkist tuna with seasoning at market price. My hands smelled like fish all day. It was awful!! The service was slow and subpar. I'm sure there are good items on the menu so I do not want to discourage anyone from coming here. Form your own opinion."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for my bday dinner, I have to say it was the best meal I have had in Cle in quite some time. (And we have had some good ones!) Our server Alexis was very prompt and great at managing the whole meal, she checked on us often enough but we never felt rushed and of course she was very friendly. Now on to the food!  Super delicious fresh seafood. I wanted to try an entree but honestly we could not get past the apps. Baked oysters were cooked just to the point of not raw, and served with the traditional sides of horseradish, lemon, and cocktail sauce. The baked oysters were Blue Point. There were three raw varieties, and my husband enjoyed those. Next we ordered the calamari. Real deal, no questionable tubes here. Lightly fried, it was delish with the kimchee and lime sauce. Our seafood cocktail tasted like it flew in from Miami. Huge chunks of scallop, squid, and shrimp. We enjoyed all this with an excellent Rose and finished with the key lime pie. Our only gripe was the thickness of the crust. I was afraid to break it with spoon for fear of injuring a fellow diner as it flew off the plate. The actual key lime part was spot on though.  Cant wait to come back and delve further into the menu!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to give this only 3 stars (I wish I could give it 2.5 stars) because I had very high hopes for Alley Cat since the location & ambiance are one of a kind in Cleveland but the service was not very friendly and the food wasn't the greatest. My husband and I got the stuffed oysters, the philly sushi roll, and the lobster roll. The stuffed oysters were pretty good but there were only 4 for about $12-14. The philly roll was very underwhelming and was a warm (not cold) temperature which made us very nervous. I was a fan of the lobster roll, it was fresh and good quality but my husband oddly did not like it. Overall, we had just an okay experience but like I said the staff wasn't very friendly and the food not very impressive."}
{"text":"I completely enjoyed my night at Alley Cat Oyster bar. I loved the variety of fresh oysters with white wine and service was great. View is $100000!!! Great place!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere we sat outside watching the boats, kayaks, and rowing teams go by. The bread was good it had corn in it(They said they change it up all the time adding things in). We had shrimp cocktail and blue point oysters on the happy hour special, they were very yummy and a great price. The broccoli Cesar salad was awesome. The clam chowder was just ok not much clam and it just didn't stand out like most of the other things. The cocktail list is exciting and they tasted delicious. We would return here for sure. The Flats are really a happening spot. It is SO nice to see the revitalization of the area."}
{"text":"Now I know that this restaurant was only open for 4 days, however I expected much better. Service was horrible. Waited an extremely long amount of time for our drinks, and then my drink was wrong. Waited another 10 minutes to find someone to tell that my drink was wrong. Ordered the crab cake, which was very good until I bit into an extremely large piece of a crab shell. The atmosphere was wonderful and the views were amazing. I was just so disappointed at our service and food quality. Especially when I watched a table get drink after drink refills and food brought out to them before our order was even taken."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, service terrible. Hostesses are rude and uninviting as soon as you walk in. First words out of the hostess mouth \"our kitchen is closing at 8:30 and its 8 now\" no \"hi\" or any greeting. Immediately turned around and left"}
{"text":"I like this place and will probably come back.I would give it 3.5 stars if possible, but don't think it quite gets 4.  My husband and I live across the street in the Flats East Bank Apartments (review here http://www.yelp.com/biz/flats-at-east-bank-cleveland?hrid=y_BliimuUFgJuVrSgk1_gA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)) and had previously been here for happy hour and finally stuck around for dinner this past week.  Although we had a table reserved, we decided to stay at the bar for dinner after catching the tail-end of happy hour.  First things first, come here for happy hour! They have one red and one white wine for $4 a glass, a cocktail for $5, and one or two beers at a great price too. They also have good food selections for happy hour too.  Three huge cocktail shrimp for $10, Bluepoint oysters for $2 a piece, popcorn shrimp, and other good options. I've previously had the cocktail shrimp (recommend) and this past time we got 6 Bluepoint oysters. They were so good! This place is an oyster bar, so if you come here, do yourself a favor and get oysters!  We then shared the seafood ceviche.  It was good, but not quite what I expected.  It seemed to have a lot of cumin in it, and way more veggies than seafood.  It also only came with 4 plantain chips, which wasn't enough for the dish. It wasn't bad, but I don't think I would order this again, but partially because there are other things I would want to try first.  For our mains, we ordered smaller dishes (after all the other food).  My husband had the \"surf n' turf\" burger and liked it.  The fries were a bit greasy and soggy though.  And it didn't look like they put the shrimp spread on it (the whole \"surf\" part). Te be fair, he didn't ask.  I'm sure if they had missed it, they would have brought some out for him.  I had the green papaya salad.  It's supposed to come with roast chicken.  I don't eat chicken, though, so I asked if I could have it with shrimp instead (which is how I've seen it every where else I've had this dish; and at one place - Bistango in Irvine, CA - with lobster, the best!).  The bartender was very accommodating and said that wouldn't be a problem.  And I got shrimp - fried rock shrimp.  While the shrimp itself was good, as was the salad, together they just weren't great.  Chilled, boiled shrimp is what I had in mind, and would have been excellent.  I can't fault them for making something special for me, though, I truly appreciate that they accommodated my request.  I would just get something different next time (unless they offer the green papaya salad with not-fried-shrimp in the future!).  We didn't have dessert, but only because we weren't hungry.  They had a coconut cheesecake that I would like to try, as well as key lime pie (who doesn't love key lime pie?).  Overall, I definitely recommend coming here - especially for happy hour! Oh, if you come for dinner be sure to make a reservation!!  A note to the restaurant - can you please install a purse/coat hook in the bathroom? Also, when we were there (May 20), it really wasn't that warm out.  Or rather, it cooled down fairly significantly by the evening, yet you kept the garage doors open. It was way too cold for that.  I get the appeal of the open-air dining, but maybe you can install heaters on that side of the restaurant (like the over-head patio heaters) to keep people warm while keeping the open air feeling?  I had to eat with my coat on, which was less than ideal."}
{"text":"Nice beautiful restaurant, great food, tasty oysters but it was so busy it took forever for our drinks and food to come out. They need more servers or more help for a better dining experience."}
{"text":"Had a really nice dinner here about one week ago. Friend and I were attending a concert at the Q and wanted to try this place out ! Staff were very courteous and accommodating. We asked to have our seat switched and no problem. Then as the sun set and it became cool management graciously pulled down the door for us to block the breeze coming off the water. This place has remarkable views of the river ! Food quality was excellent. Giving four stars because the portions are rather small. All in all a really good experience and will go back !!"}
{"text":"Foods not bad. Service is AWFUL. Went with a group of people. it took 30 minutes just to get drinks, more than an hour for appetizers. There is no organization. Our table had more than 4 servers. We got here at 8pm and due to slow service we didn't get to leave till 11pm. Servers are RUDE. Do not go here."}
{"text":"I waiver between three to four stars...however ultimately the three star comes from the value of food quality versus price. The oysters we had were good though at $3 each they are the priciest I have had in northeast ohio. Maybe $2 each or a price cut for getting a dozen would help. At the end of the day the oysters were not worthy of being the highest priced.  We had the lobster roll and mac and cheese for main course dishes. I thought both tasted fine; however again could have easily been sub $20 dishes. The other alternative would be more food to compensate for the cost. I would reorder the mac and cheese but the lobster roll was pretty skimpy and the lobster was overcooked with a little bit of rubbery texture.  For dessert we tried the coconut cake. This would absolutely be something to pass up in the future. It tasted as if this was a frozen store bought coconut flour traditional pudding. After a couple bites we just pushed it aside. On the plus side, our waitress did remove dessert from the bill.  At times service felt slow, but I think this was perception. From start to finish our meal took 45 minutes. That is walking in the door to walking out. We were not rusjed by staff, just our desire to walk around on a nice evening.  Another plus was that we saw the owner helpimg his staff. That means he was refilling water, bussing tables, serving food, etc. Although I feel the food value isn't there, I would return to support a dedicated owner."}
{"text":"Where to begin...waited over 40 minutes for a table..sat down and saw 7 empty tables...stayed empty until we left. Hostesses were very unorganized and underdressed for the position. Oysters were ok...nothing special. Lobster roll was horrible...absolutely no taste. Hamburger was the worst ever...the bun was saturated in some type of oil and was falling apart...husband could not eat it and we didn't even take it home for the dogs. Manager came over to ask how everything was....I told him about the burger and he asked if my husband would like another one! Umm...NO!!! He didn't like that answer and with a swift grab and a nasty attitude took our check. On the way out we heard the hostess telling people that there was a 60 to 90 minute wait... those tables around us were still empty...good luck to this place...it will probably close in a few months."}
{"text":"We went for the Sunday Brunch, that day was really sunny and we wanted to sit outside to enjoy the good weather, we asked if they can put the umbrella over our table and the server said no, because it's a little windy and it's difficult for me to bring you your food, we never understood that, I ordered the burger it was awful, it was super greasy and not good, my husband ordered the octopus and it was delicious!  The server left us desattended most of the time, thanks to one of the Puerto Rican guys we had service, but not from our server, definitely we will come back, hopefully the service is better next time."}
{"text":"Cool location on the Flats. Oysters were good, but being used to VA/NC/LA oysters these were mega expensive. Entrees were fair at best. Halibut over cooked, and rice with tuna came out almost frozen. Poor value for the $."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of negative reviews so was nervous but we had no issues with service. Our waitress was actually pretty amazing, attentive and willing to offer advice and get us answers about the different types of oysters when we didn't know.  We did some oyster shooters ( only my third time having them and tasted good- but I may not be the best judge). Also got a crab cake which I found very tasty. It was a decent size as well.  I went with the blackened fish which was good but it came with these smoked sweet potatoe mashed potatoes that were oh so good! Never had anything like it! So happy I went with this dish. I tasted the octopus and thought it was just okay and the othe fish special was pretty good as well that I had a bite of! I think next time I will want to try the lobster roll bc our waitress also suggested that.  For dessert they we're out of the vanilla bean crème brûlée but suggested the cookies and cream one they had on hand instead. This dessert we shared and it was amazing even though I only had a few bites I will say though that it was more of a custard than a typical crème brûlée but definitely good plenty of cookies!"}
{"text":"Absolutely had the best dining experience here for my significant other's birthday. We had a reservation for 8:45 on a Friday night and it was busy and fun.  One of the things that sticks with me here is the service. Our waiter was attentive, knowledgable and did a fantastic job with recommendations and timing the food.   We tried the charred broccoli Caesar salad which was the bomb. Definitely give it a shot. We also got the clams, which as my boyfriend indicated the \"broth was magical.\" We also split the swordfish --- fabulous! It came paired well with a shrimp succotash, an edamame sauce and microgreens. Very fresh and well balanced dinner. We ended with a chocolate caramel dessert which was on point. Light, decadent and the perfect ending to a wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"Bartenders were extremely friendly, recognized some of them from other establishments so they have experience.  Drinks were very good and refreshing.  Food took a little while to come out but it was very busy and we were not in a rush. We enjoyed everything we ordered.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic oyster restaurant!  We had delicious Wildcat Cove oysters from WA and their very tasty ceviche.  The vinagerette sauce (+ optional addition of Tabasco) went perfectly with the oysters. Although pricey - especially considering the cost of parking - I do look forward to coming here for dollar oysters on the weeknights.  I'm happy to see a new seafood restaurant in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Drinks were fine. Appetizers are good but not great. Crab cake was very good; beef tartare was not. The \"burger\" has a deep-fried bun situation that is downright horrifying. You couldn't pay me to eat here again."}
{"text":"This place was good. The scenic views and atmosphere were great. Food wise: the stuffed peppers were AMAZING (definitely recommend trying those). Calamari was tasty too. For the main entrée I ordered the Grilled Octopus. The octopus itself I enjoyed it, it was tender and yummy. The mixture of beans and ham that it accompanied was not tasty at all (I didn't like that bean mixture).The other people in our party ordered chicken salad, oysters and crab cake- they were delicious they said."}
{"text":"Well darn...  really wanted to like this better.  The flats are gorgeous now and so much to enjoy!  Walking the boardwalk, the multitudes of roses, twinkling lights on the water, all enchanting!   We made reservations for our anniversary and requested a window seat or patio.  Arrived and it was not the case.  I can understand- they were quite busy for 8:45pm.   It was very loud, small tables very close to each other- perhaps not the best spot for a romantic evening to start.  My first issue was a terribly wobbly table!  Hubby rested his forearm after the water was poured and his shirt was soaked catching his glass with great reaction.  Waitress arrived and asked for our drink order- we mentioned he table and she instantly ran over and brought a perfectly sized shim- clearly the table issue was not new.  The table adjacent to us must have known someone as they were waited on hand and foot while we sat there with empty water glasses, no plates for our appetizers and less than mediocre service overall.  The food was fine, but there are plenty of places for decent food in the area.  There was nothing I'd write home about.  Our overall experience was very poor.  I would not return."}
{"text":"The only thing good about Alley Cat is that the setting, on a sunny day, is beautiful. We arrived at 5 PM on a Saturday without reservations, hoping to find a table on the lower patio where the full dinner menu is served. We found the staff arrogant and rude and were told nothing was available on the lower patio. They added my name to a wait list in case someone didn't show up. We gave up and found ourselves seats on the upper patio where they serve drinks and a limited menu. Unfortunately, we found ourselves overlooking the coveted lower patio where we watched a table sit empty for the next 90 minutes. So much for their 'wait list' and being accommodating to their customers..!! We ordered oysters which were good but very overpriced. The Mexican Seafood Chopped Salad was bland and flavorless as were the Fish Tacos. Just as well we limited our consumption of their flavorless, overpriced food. Overall, a bad experience and we will not return. Lots of other choices in the Flats. AVOID THIS PLACE!!"}
{"text":"As a huge fan of Zack B. restaurants with L'Albatros being my favorite and Parallax being my second favorite, this one is right in line in terms of quality. I visited this establishment this past Saturday with my husband. My tuna tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly rare atop a bed of edamame with a (I think) balsamic soy dressing. We also ordered the oysters rock which were delicious. My husband had the burger with fries. The burger had carrots on it which was not to my liking and it tasted like the fries were fried in duck fat. The fries were good and the bun that the burger was on was good too. I had a generous wine pour and my husband said his martini was excellent. The food was great, however, the server was very low energy and lack luster. She seemed very disengaged."}
{"text":"First off, service very slow. No one was in restaurant and still took a long time. I had the fried chicken and it came out 45 minutes later still pink and gooey. Sent it back and got the strip steak which was alright regular steak eh. The fried chicken has the same fried stuff as the calamari and has a weird taste."}
{"text":"We came here for Father's Day dinner and weren't disappointed.  Even though we sat in the patio in 98 degree heat with no umbrella we still enjoyed it all.  Drinks were great, mussels were off the chart and the kitchen sink BBQ platter was amazing!   I forget our waitresses name but she was great too."}
{"text":"We enjoyed oir dinner very much. We are from spanish north coast where seefood is amazing. So we had salmon and lobster. It was very nice and service from Stephanie was super!"}
{"text":"This was my first and last time there. We came for my best friends birthday. The server was very nice. I believe she was new because she was not very knowledgeable about the menu. Im a manager at a restaurant, my best friend is a manager at a restaurant and the other 6 people at the table are in the industry as well. The server being new was no problem to us, although it would have been to others. After waiting an hour for food 3 entrees came out with no potatoes. They told us they were out. Why would you not tell us that so we could sub the side or order something else instead of sending food out with no side? Also the menu states tostones with the entree, yet it came out with plantain chips. The bbq pork chop came out with no bbq sauce . 2 new entrees were ordered to replace 2 out of the 3 that came out wrong. 1 came out ok. The second pork chop came out rare and again with no bbq sauce. So long story short I waited an hour to find out you were out of what I ordered and the second item took another 30 minutes, everyone was done eating and it came out rare with no sauce. I had no dinner that night at my dinner party. I was very disappointed. I go to Chinato all the time. I assumed the standards would be the same considering zack bruell sets high standards starting with the kitchen. It was horrible."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!!!! Literally nobody at the restaurant and they \"didn't have any openings\". Absolutely terrible!! I will never give this place a second chance. Absolutely awful. Ended up eating bar. I will say the clam chowder was delicious... For that they get a second star"}
{"text":"I was in my 20s during the heyday of the Flats and like other Clevelanders of my generation, I have both fun and melancholy memories of the East Bank. And after having dinner at Alley Cat it was the fun remembrances that are stirring. The restaurant with a wall of windows sits just feet from the river, giving a gorgeous view. Of course the Saturday night we were there it was cold and pouring rain but on nice days the walls can roll up like a garage door and you get the fresh air as well as a great view. This is a Zach Bruell restaurant (Parallax, L'Albattross) so we were expecting top-notch food, and we weren't disappointed. Jeannene and I had the ceviche appetizer ($11) and thought there was just the right amount of heat and acid with the tuna and halibut. The accompanying slices of avocado added a creamy element and the thick tostados gave the required crunch. Our only complaint the entire evening was it needed more chips. I had Halibut ($30) for my main course and it came with potatoes, squash and everything was well prepared, but the star of the plate that brought it all together was light brown sauce that had an amazing umami taste which I wasn't expecting with a fish dish. Jeannene had a lobster roll ($22) that definitely did not skimp on the lobster, and instead of fries she had the succotash. I thought she had made a mistake as how can you not want fries with a lobster roll, right? But the succotash included bacon and a nice pepperiness so when she said she was finished I quickly took the last 3 forkfulls. For dessert I had the coconut cheesecake ($7) which whisked me to the Carribbean (despite the weather), and Jeannene had the chocolate terrine ($7) which had elements of chocolate mousse and cake. Oops, I guess I have two minor complaints instead of one. The terrine came with a salted caramel sauce and, believe me, I love saltiness in a chocolate dessert but I thought there were too main grains of salt. There was also a decent cocktail list and quite a large wine list (which you wouldn't have gotten at an establishment in the Flats in the 1990s)."}
{"text":"Great location in downtown Cleveland in the flats. Eating outside is pleasant as it is right on the water. The food is tasty however a reservation was made and it was not known that the brunch buffet would be required. Most places still allow you to order off the menu. We aren't buffet people so for that reason it wasnt a great place for us!"}
{"text":"First let me say the ambiance and location are outstanding.  Unfortunately, the service was not equal to say the least in comparison to the expectation.  Our waitress was openly rude to us , rolling her eyes, after our appetizer (Oysters) AND entree were brought out to us WRONG. (we ordered a specific oyster and were presented with a sampler, we ordered a fish filet specifically and were presented with a whole fish ....bones/skin/fins and all)  The waitress also looked at us like we had three heads when we asked for crackers for our oysters.    She took a long time to come to the table each time food was delivered to even discover the mistake.  We asked for her recommendation when we ordered the stuffed peppers and were not warned in any way that they would EXTREMELY HOT.   We like HOT, but it should have been mentioned in my opinion up front.   The manager tried to rectify the negative experience by bringing us HIS favorite entree (which we had already rejected when it was first recommended to us) After sitting through this negative experience for close to 3 hours, we finally discovered our waitress had abandoned us completely and had to go find a second manager to print our bill.  We still paid for the entree which we never got to enjoy.  If you are going for views and drinks prepare to pay extreme prices.  I don't recommend trying a dinner experience."}
{"text":"Alley Cat is the only place worth going in the East Bank. The food is amazing. The staff and management are awesome. The view is to die for and the atmosphere inside is romantic. I love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing drinks and amazing service! Checked out Alley Oysters for the first time with a group of friends and everything was perfection! I recommend placing a reservation because when we got there the wait was a couple hours long but there was room at the bar for all of us so it worked out. My boyfriend and I split the stuffed oysters. HIGHLY recommend getting them. I got the grilled cheese and he got the fish sandwich. They both were SO GOOD! We could eat there everyday and never get sick of the food. Alley Oyster has now become one of our favorite restaurants in the east bank flats!"}
{"text":"Seafood Quesadilla is amazing - worth the trip just for them . Crab cake is awesome, but you only get one for 15$. Clam chowder doesn't have a ton of clams and potatoes are a bit under cooked. You may prefer that way. Oysters were solid, with a nice presentation, but no explanation of what was what when runner placed on the table."}
{"text":"Delicious food (I got the walleye), great atmosphere. On the pricey side but so worth it. Be sure to make a reservation, it's poppin!"}
{"text":"Great views of the Cleveland bridges and the waterfront. The oysters were great. The snap pea salad and seafood quesadillas were really tasty as well. The lobster roll was lackluster. Modern ambience with good service. The East Bank area has built up some good steam and looks to only get better with time. Alley cat has a prime location within the new east bank. I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"Food was really great but the hostess was a real dud and the service was lacking. It took them 12 minutes to figure out who was serving our table among the 5 people standing around and they were empty other than our party of four. They're not cheap either."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing.  Booked the outdoor \"private\"space for a party of 15 - many of whom flew in from out of town.  It took over an hour for the appetizers to be served.  Took close to 2 hours for our entrees to come in.  Waited some more for wine glasses to be brought to the table.  Food was sloppy.  We will never go back."}
{"text":"A cute restaurant on the water, but not a whole lot more than that. The food is good but a little pricey for my taste.. We were given the brunch menu when we went in the afternoon. We got the BLT mussels, whole fried fish, and the surf and turf burger. The BLT mussels were the best, even though the broth was a little salty, it was amazing with the free bread. The whole fried fish wasn't as meaty as I'd hoped, but the texture was on point. The plating was a little messy, and the grits were more granulated than I would've expected. The surf n turf burger was good, but I couldn't quite taste the \"surf.\" The patty leaked a lot of juice, so the bottom bun was a little soggy.. The happy hour is not bad, cheap drinks and $2 oysters starting at 3pm! Come to hangout on the water, but don't expect mind blowing food."}
{"text":"The food was good - not great.  Steamed clams were good; tuna steak had decent flavor.  Service was not good.  Ten minutes to order one drink; fifteen minutes until drink arrived.  Waiter disappeared until time for check when he became very friendly and chatty."}
{"text":"Great place, moved to Vegas 4 years ago came back to this, loved it, so much happening downtown makes me wanna move back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is where high expectations are rewarded. A great location that I can imagine is pretty magical come summer coupled with an A+ chef. I expected a lot and it delivered. Highly recommend the oysters, BLT mussels and the charred broccoli caesar is a work of art. Beautifully butter poached lobster was delicious in the lobster roll and the shrimp and grits had nice spice and flavor. Only misstep was the chocolate terrine, which was adequate but not at the same level as the rest of the meal. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"They lost the order so the food came very late after we had to complain. The burger was undercooked despite requesting medium. They were only willing to comp a single beer. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Good Friday lunch with my wife at Alley Cat Oyster Bar. Alley Cats does brings the Flats back to the rivers edge. Great location right on the East bank of the mighty Cuyahoga river with excellent visuals looking outside at the river, bridges and the western side of the flats. Just like the old days in the flats parking is at pay lots relatively close to the restaurant- 100 or so yards walk to the front door.   The decor of Alley Cats is nice, clean and neat but it will not steal your attention way from the river view, at least it was not filled up with every piece of nautical bric-a-brac known to humankin. We were seated at a window table and our waiter quickly had our drink order out to us. I was tempted by the a very good selection of bourbon and scotch but opted for a Great Lakes Dortmunder Gold.   We started lunch with a dozen oysters, three different varieties, and had fun with the compare and contrast in taste- some more briney than others. The oyster were shucked well with no damage to the meat and plenty of oysters liquor left in the shell. Next on the dinning menu was a cup of oysters chowder that also hit the spot, Cream based but not overly thickened. I prefer my chowders to me a bit looser and not having the consistency of gravey. Decent amount of oysters in the serving, I would order again.  Our main course orders were the Salmon for my wife while I went for the Shrimp Po-Boy. My wife's salmon was the winning dish, prepared just right with a nice sauce and nice mix of veggies. I was a bit perplexed by my order. First sight was a amazing amount of French Fries on the plate. I mean a huge amount of fries, basically a F-ing large amount of French Fries. To be fair they were pretty good.   The PoBoy bread was a odd item that looked like a thick piece of Texas toast grilled with a slot cut 1/4 the way down to hold the shrimp and veggies. The PoBoy was not easy to handle and maneuver with shrimp and fixing falling all over the place. I finally gave up and pulled the remaining internals out and ate them off my plate, dumping the bread off to the side plate. While everything tasted good I would recommend a reengineer of this sandwich construction.  Final thoughts is we'll come back again, this was our fourth trip to Alley Cats. Our waiter was professional being attentive enough, timely and polite while not being over bearing. Be prepared to spend a few bucks -dozen oysters, cup of chowder, 2 lunch plates and four drinks ( 2 draft beers and 2 glasses of wine) totaled a $120 before tip. Final score from 1 to 5 points is a solid 4 stars. My reference pool scoring Alley Cats is verses Pier W, Blue Points, Don's Lighthouse and Salmon Dave's."}
{"text":"Good not great, a little expensive for the portion. We started with Oysters and those are on point. We also got the Ceviche and it was lack luster at best, not much fish with an overload of onion with another sprinkle of onion mixed with onion. The main course was the Lobster roll for three of the four of us. Small portion of lobster with a cucumber mixed in a dill sauce on a butter/toasted roll. It was a little dry and again not much for $25, I forgot you do get some fries. The fourth at our table got the short rib and it was very good, I tried a bite. Tender rib meat you can cut with a fork. Overall the location and view was great, food was good but higher priced for what you get. I don't mind paying for what you get and this visit just didn't deliver."}
{"text":"I came once for happy hour when it first opened and finally got to come again for lunch. Like other people noted, I had tried a couple apps at the happy hour...but still could barely get past them on my second visit! So many great options! Recently, we tried a bit of so many dishes. We of course ordered raw oysters which were very fresh tasting. We also ordered clams and mussels. The clams really weren't anything special (although good), but the mussels were \"BLT\" style. It had chunks of bacon, stewed tomatoes, and steamed/wilted lettuce (may not sound appealing but it works!!!) all in a delicious broth. We always judge a place on their calamari and for second time I have been here it was great. Tender tentacles with tangy kimchi accompaniment. The shrimp stuffed peppers were also delicious. They were pretty spicy according to the rest of my table but I thought it was the right amount of heat! I was surprised how good this dish was bc I wasn't that interested when reading the description. We also tried the tartar, shrimp po boy, and the surf and turf burger. The burger I loved bc the bun was so flavorful, but nice and thin. It was the perfect meat:carb ratio (I hate bready burgers!). Chef Bruell has done it again. I didn't put 5 stars bc it is really expensive and also the servers seem a little disorganized. They were very nice but a little awkward. And our section seemed to have two waiters taking care of many tables so they would either check on us right after one another or there would be long stretches where no one checked o us."}
{"text":"Went to Alley Cat for my husband's birthday celebration. Our server was great and very knowledgeable about the menu. After many of his suggestions we tried the crab cakes and clam chowder for appetizers, I had the lobster roll and my husband had the yellow fin tuna for entrees, followed by the coconut cheesecake and chocolate caramel cake for dessert. Everything was wonderful and fresh, but I would highly recommend the lobster roll and clam chowder, some of the best I've ever had, even when comparing to the east coast restaurants."}
{"text":"I thought this place was amazing! We each sampled all three oysters they had on special. Delicious! We also had the shrimp cocktail and loved it. The clam chowder was also delicious! I got the crab cake appetizer as my meal. The dish as a whole was very good. The crab cake itself was good, not great. My boyfriend got the steak dinner. We're both curious to what made the steak a $55 steak. It wasn't worth that much, but overall we had a great night, so I think it's worth 5 stars anyways. The banana cream pie was absolutely amazing as well! We'll definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"So looking forward to this as Zach is my favorite chef.  Really disappointing for me.  The braised beef was simply pot roast with some heat.  Zach usually layers on the flavor, this was very one dimensional.  My wife had halibut and it was very good.  The octopus was good.  The service very good and the location excellent.  However, the margarita was very watery and the scotch pour frankly was skimpy at best.  Interesting menu but long way to go to reach Parallax or L'Albatross.  Hopefully he will improve it.  Price value relationship poor ... Not worth it .. A real shame"}
{"text":"Lunch on the Cuyahoga River weather is excellent there is a bit of a breeze off Lake Erie we are inside but the large garage doors are open.   I had the shrimp sandwich served on a buttered and toasted roll. Very good flavors. The fried shrimp had a great taste. I got a small side salad rather than fries.   Wife had a burger which she said was excellent.   Son had salmon and he was extremely pleased with his meal.   Love it when the owners come by regularly to check on everything.   So it's a five. Worth a visit if you are on the east side of the Flats."}
{"text":"I must put a warning on this that I did give it 5 stars, but I was also very intoxicated while I was there so that may have something to do with my raving review to follow.   I have already recommended this place to countless friends/family and if you like seafood, you have to check it out! I had to most delicious martini (wish I could remember the name) but I know it was vodka with champagne and it was delicious!  Also, a friend of mine got a drink she didn't like and the waiter immediately took it back and brought her something else.    We obviously had never been there before since its new and the waiter had definitely tried everything on the menu and was able to explain what was splitable, what flavors everything had and if you like this, you'll like this.  I tried a few different appetizers they had.. the seafood quesadilla was my favorite and the stuffed peppers which were really spicy were so good (but you definitely have to like spicy).  Not everyone like oysters so we only got 6 and split it among 3 of us.  I don't recall every liking Oysters but I definitely ate two of them without a squint of the face (could of been the alcohol).  We also split one of the lobster rolls and it was delicious!  It is not a very good thing to split with more than 2 people though but I would go back and order everything I had again.    The feel inside was hip and new, they had TVs to watch any sporting event and killer drinks.  Obviously you are going to paying a little more at a restaurant like this but give it a shot for a fun date night before heading over to another new spot in the flats!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST Lobster Roll in Cleveland !!  If you like lobster rolls you must try this place. It's going to cost you but it's with it."}
{"text":"Went here based on a recommendation from a fellow Yelper and glad I did.  Zack Bruell is becoming my favorite chef in the area as I'm also a fan of Cowell & Hubbard (the motto seems to be excellent food at reasonable prices).  I started with the BLT mussels and while I'm typically pretty ambivalent about mussels, these were excellent.  The portion was generous, the broth was spicy but not overwhelming and I'm pleased the waitress suggested getting extra toast points as they were all used to mop up the broth!  Not seeing grilled octopus often on a menu, I jumped at the chance and wasn't disappointed.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quantity--a hefty bunch of tentacles.  It sat on a bed of succotash which resulted in the octopus losing its grilled quality over time sitting in the liquid beneath it.  Very good nonetheless.  I'll definitely be returning to taste other items.  Very pleased to be greeted with a nice plateful of fresh and actually crisp bread.  I'm pretty sure that On The Rise supplies it for Bruell's restaurants.  Best tasting bread outside of NYC and Jersey.  Service was good and the atmosphere is very relaxed.  While it's not an ocean view, at least it does look out onto water!"}
{"text":"Excellent \"Happy hour\". We sampled the peach sangria which was delicious and refreshing. We also had the fried oysters and Latin loaded potato's, both were equally tasty.  The decor offers a beautiful view of the river and nice inside ambiance.  The only surprise and NOT necessarily a negative is the bathrooms that only accommodate one guest at a time. We would visit again."}
{"text":"Went for the view and enjoyed some good food! Maybe not the best, but good enough we would go back. I recommend the calamari with pickled peppers! We ordered a second! The oysters were good and with happy hour every day 3-6 it was a good deal for a table 6! Wine 4$a glass and app specials. Our server recommended the salmon over the cobia and I was not disappointed! Crisp skin, perfectly cooked middle, and so moist with great flavor!! The lobster roll is overrated for $25..too much bread! Some of the family was excited to have Mitchell ice cream with out having to leave their seats!!"}
{"text":"This place is exceptional--I'm from NYC and never expected to find this caliber of restaurant in Cleveland. The oysters are out of this world. The iceberg salad is my favorite salad, it's comfort food with nuance. And I can't say enough about the Faroe Island salmon. All while watching the boats go by. This is the perfect place. Service is impeccable, always reliable and consistent. I've been here a dozen times since it opened and will continue to be a regular."}
{"text":"If you are accustomed to the interesting menus found in the other Zack Bruell restaurants, don't go to Alley Cat.   If you're accustomed to the professional service found in other Zack Bruell restaurants, don't go to Alley Cat.   f you are accustomed to the fair prices found in the other Zack Bruell restaurants, don't go to Alley Cat.   f you are accustomed to the damn near perfect experience found in the other Zack Bruell restaurants, don't go to Alley Cat.   For any other restauranteur, this would be an OK place. If you're ZB, this must be considered a failure. Too, too bad."}
{"text":"The clam chowder is amazing. Ah-mazing. It's light and fresh and different from any clam chowder I've had. The salad with peas and mint is light and refreshing. I wasn't prepared for how Asian the tuna was, which is probably my fault. I would stick with soup and salad but would definitely come back. The view alone is worth it."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the restaurant has a beautiful view of the river.  The service was outstanding and overall a fun dining experience."}
{"text":"We spent our anniversary here last night. It was the perfect ambiance. We ate outside and watched the rowers go by and listened to the distant live band across the river at Shooters. The view with all of the flats bridges is glorious. Our server was attentive. The food was fabulous. We had the Alley Cat Oysters Rockefeller for an  appetizer along with Riesling wine by the glass. The bottles of wine were expensive but we did not need that much anyway to relax. I had the Lobster Roll, the bun was crunchy, the Lobster was served warm and it had a fantastic Green Goddess sauce on it. The fries where great too. Would highly recommend coming down to the east side of the Flats again. Its a cool, hip place to hang out. Make sure you use the Valet service only 8 dollars to park and is cheaper than any parking lot we passed."}
{"text":"Fantastic new addition to the Flats. If you have not been to the East Bank lately you should . Great food here , fresh , reasonably priced. Right on the water and parking is directly next door . Blue points are delicious !!!"}
{"text":"We live across the street at the flats and we're really looking forward to a meal here. The food wasn't bad but our waiter barely stopped by and wasn't the friendliest at all. We specifically asked if the oysters were $3 an oyster and were told no that was for three oysters so we doubled our order and clarified once more. Than when we got our order we were surprised by the bill. We still left a 20% tip because we wanted it to be clear that we really were just unhappy with the service and lack of apology or even care when our bill was double what we thought and that it wasn't about us trying to save money. We had horrible service and don't plan on going there anymore which is a shame because I work at the Ernst and young building across the street and had thought this was a place we could frequent."}
{"text":"Being brand new, I was highly impressed at how well Alley Cat had their stuff together. We had impeccable service and with me being an oyster fanatic-- I was SO excited to have more oyster options nearby. They had 3 options of oysters available the night we went, but the server said they will eventually offer all of them that are listed on their menu.   Our server was very knowledgeable of the different oyster types & flavors. You can order in increments of 3,6,9 or 12. We ordered 6 of 2 different types. I love the ability to mix and match. The perch sandwich was delicious and the ambiance was great. Alley Cat is situated right along the Cuyahoga River on the bank directly across from Shooter's. I am so excited it is within walking distance of my apartment and will without a doubt, be back very soon!"}
{"text":"We had Valentine's dinner here and the food was great! We loved everything we got. I had blue point oysters for an appetizer (happy hour) they were fresh and delicious. My husband had the New England clam chowder. It was really good. For the entrees, I had the wedge salad with miso dressing which was really good. I added the shrimp for an additional $6. My son had the fish sandwich with fries which was really good and huge!! My husband had the lobster roll which was really delicious. The prices were a bit high but the food was good. The scenery was great too-right on the river."}
{"text":"Much better this time around..place was packed,  but found a space at the bar. Service was great and food was very good. While I prefer octopus ceviche, the fish/shrimp w avacado still had great flavor. The whole, fried snapper and veg was also very good. I didn't love the halibut, bit others did. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went to Alley Cat a month or so after it first opened. It was still warm out so the garage doors were open. The view is amazing. I went just for drinks and light bites so I sat at the bar. Bartenders are very attentive. I had the cucumber mojito which was muddled to perfection. I also had fresh raw oysters which were delicious. They had 3 different varieties available on that day. I also tried the beef tartare which was perfectly sized and adorned with an egg, I found it to be very tasty, the toast that they served it with was very crispy and complimented the tartare well. My companion ordered the hush puppies which were light and crispy, these weren't dense and weighed down like some places seem to make them. Overall I enjoyed my experience there. The bar staff tag teams the bar area so the service is very speedy. I would like to go back to have a full dinner."}
{"text":"If I'm not grading Zack Bruell standards, this was a great experience. I do agree that the service is not near the standard one would expect from his group, but the food was outstanding and the location is gorgeous.  My husband and I had reserved via Open Table, requesting a window seat a mere 30 minutes before we were heading over on a Sunday afternoon. We arrived and were immediately taken to a perfect corner table, inside, on the windows. The complimentary bread arrived almost immediately - and we were thinking, 'who said the service here is lacking ...\" but, 10 minutes later when we still did not have water, we started to understand the other reviews.  Our server took our drink and appetizer orders, our drinks arrived, but our water was not refilled for about 10 minutes after booth were empty and the bread was never replenished. We were in our seats about 20 minutes before the appetizers arrived. Both were outstanding I had the soup special - a corn puree that was heavenly - with a heavy drizzle of olive oil that was surprisingly the perfect compliment to the rich corn. My husband had the BLT mussels and finished every drop. It smelled amazing and I got to dip a bit of the crostini that came with it into the sauce, and it was briny, bacon-y, tomato-y goodness.  We finished our appetizers and my soup bowl stayed on the table for the next 10 minutes and was only removed when our entrees arrived. My husband's mussel shell bowl was never removed - and stayed on the table until after they cleared our dinner dishes. Since the main windows were open to the outside, there were flies inside the restaurant who were very interested in the mussel bowl. This was not pleasant, but after the initial check on our entrees, we did not see our server until we were finished with our meal.   The Lobster Roll was small, but well prepared. No real briny flavor (I am comparing to East Coast - including Maine), but a nice (warm) butter poached flavor, paired with celery (and I think fennel). The roll is small and there is not a ton of lobster for the $22 price tag. There are A LOT of fries on the plate. They're good, but they make up about 2/3 of the plate. My husband had the salmon special with squash and fingerling potatoes. He enjoyed it, but not as much as the BLT mussels.  All in all, we enjoyed our meal, the view of the river was amazing, the service was -- I think the best description would be \"immature\" - not quite making that leap to what one expects at Alley Cat prices or Zack Bruell's reputation. We both agreed Alley Cat doesn't make our must return immediately list, but it's definitely a place we would come back to and, maybe try the upstairs or just do appetizers -- because those were both some of the best we've had -- anywhere!!"}
{"text":"Went to alleycat for our anniversary, the service was great, the food was good, and the atmosphere was wonderful. The Red snapper was the best fish I've had in Ohio."}
{"text":"My husband and I briefly visited Alley Oyster while in the Flats in Cleveland! Besides the great location they have a great Happy Hour! Domestic beer is dirt cheap as well as the wine by the glass! They had an amazing Spanish wine that I enjoyed very much!!! While there we just had oysters... Fresh Blue Point Oysters at $2 each... A delightful evening!"}
{"text":"Had dinner on the outside patio with a beautiful view of the water. The food was delicious. I would've given this place 5 stars given the clams and the oysters were delicious. However, our waitress didn't get to us until 15-20 minutes after we were sitting there. The busboy had to go get her. Then she never offered us anything to drink. A Diet Coke would've been great, so we just drank water. We would've had dessert there but since she was so all over the place we went elsewhere instead. The restaurant is quite nice but they definitely need to work on taking better care of their customers. I liked the food, so I may give it one more try next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I was entertaining some clients from South America and wanted to take them somewhere fun in Cleveland. I selected Alley Cat and was excited to try it. My first disappointment was that I requested a patio table on my reservation. We were seated inside, in the bar area, but that's not a huge deal.  Throughout our entire meal, our service was poor, which made for a disappointing dinner. The server was not charming or friendly in any way, but quite rude. I selected a bottle of wine for the table. She brought over the wrong one. When I pointed it out to her, she snapped back with something about vintages not being menu correct. I told her it was the completely wrong bottle. She brought over the correct bottle, but then had no wine etiquette on opening procedure or pouring. She presented and poured the bottle to the wrong person, all while making snarky comments about the vintages always changing.  My colleague asked for dinner recommendations & her response was \"It's different from person to person\" Obviously, but she could have mentioned what is popular, or even her favorites to steer him in SOME direction. She had no idea how to upsell, or even sell anything in that matter.  We were celebrating a birthday which I also mentioned on OpenTable reservations. We ordered three desserts, & not one arrived with candle. We flagged her down & told her she forgot the birthday, & she said something about them \"not offering birthday desserts\". We weren't expecting anything free, just a candle. She did bring out a scoop of ice cream with a candle in it after that.  The appetizers we started with were great! Mussels, oysters, & raw calamari. My entrée of seared tuna was great, but my colleague said his monkfish was not good at all & he made a mistake ordering it. My other guest had the lobster mac & cheese which he said was just okay, & not what he was expecting.  2 stars for very expensive average meal."}
{"text":"Great place in the flats, right on the river. I got the lobster roll and it was very good, messy but good. The service was great, the server was very quick, and the food came out in about 10-15 minutes. I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes newer seafood dishes. The only negative is the parking situation. You basically have to valet your car, which $10 plus tip."}
{"text":"The amazing view of Cleveland water front.  The inside is nice the bar seats suck! suck!  Cold hard uncomfortable. Outside of that very nice inside. The food is good would like come back try more. The staff vibrant lots personality. Wish they had jet ski dock. Yummy oysters."}
{"text":"Cleveland has long lived down being colored as this mistake by the lake. Well, this does not really apply anymore these days, with the brand-spanking new boardwalk, the Flats East Bank development and this new restaurant of Zach Bruell among many others; color me impressed. The location is the first I'll comment on and dare I say, sunny, lively and happening?  As for the food, if the name of the restaurant has oyster in it, order the oysters. I especially loved the baked oysters that reminded me of the grilled oysters of Louisiana. Otherwise, enjoy this summer destination of a restaurant, go for the seafood, and watch the fun festive, and very drunk, people zip by on their boats! (How do I make friends with them?)"}
{"text":"The signature drinks were the best part....after we were served those everything went down hill..FAST. YOU will need to LOVE cilantro to eat here, because everything we ordered was covered in it...COVERED. Octopus was cooked bad and overall dish was a mess."}
{"text":"High expectations... average experience. Waited an hour for an outdoor seat and once seated we were told it's a limited menu on the upper level. Would have been nice to know beforehand. (Even better to simply serve the full menu everywhere.)   So we decided to put our name in for a table downstairs (another hour) and have apps upstairs. Cocktails, dozen oysters, and ceviche style app from specials. Was OK but the oysters were $36 a dozen and the service was poor.  Then went downstairs for main meal. By now it was dark and chilly... high 50's. They sat us by the large open window and we froze our asses off.   Wife had the $22 Lobster Roll, which tasted good but was about 3 bites. It's on one piece of Texas toast and not exactly overloaded.   I had the Grouper Cheeks based off servers rec. Was decent, nothing special flavor wise. The service was very good this time around from the male server who's name I forgot.   Overall, a C+.  Excellent views. Hit or miss service and food. Overpriced for sure."}
{"text":"The A has been a favorite of mine for good food since the beginning, but you truly never know how much people's good grace and genuine hearts can make something as simple as a dinner turn into one of the best and most relaxing nights we've had :) from Tanya who greeted us at the door, to our boy Z who bought us dessert, to the manager Penny who popped by and most importantly our INCREDIBLE server Aby who is not only an exceptional server but an incredibly genuine human being. We spent 3 hours on the beautiful patio enjoying our drinks, our dinner and then were gifted dessert from these boys (Aby & Z) just to make our day brighter. When they found out that my best friend has chemotherapy coming up, they stopped by with gracious words, genuine love & we spent our evening laughing and enjoying ourselves. There are simply not enough good things that I can say about the Alleycat - it's always worth the wait & I absolutely love coming here!!"}
{"text":"Kudos to the staff for having to continue to apologize for bad food and lack of liquor and basic mixers! Not sure why they stay except for the fact that the location makes them boatloads of money! Oysters were poorly shucked - they were cut in half with most of the oyster stuck on the shell. Send your kitchen staff to Blue Pointe so they can learn to shuck properly! Watched a runner try to auction a burger at the bar until the kitchen corrected the order by scraping the burger and sending it back to the rightful patron who was clearly pissed! So want to like this place since Zach's other places are so good! My recommendation remains Avoid this place. So sad."}
{"text":"Terrible service tonight  Only had one menu for 5 people, forgot our ice water, did not bring the oil for our bread, tuna plate approximately 0.2 ounces, only 3 small pieces and the rest vegetables, but charged $32 for the tuna plate.  My parents fries  hard has rocks!!"}
{"text":"Place is boring other than river view, waiter boring, food overpriced, untrained wait staff.... With so many great options in Cleveland area, steer clear of this travesty! I ordered spicy shrimp stuffed peppers, peppers were extremely spicy. Asked if waiter what kind of peppers were used, he comes back from kitchen stating they are wax peppers. I googled and don't think they even exist. This place sucks!"}
{"text":"Okay... View is beautiful... It is too dark during dinner time. Could not even see what I was eating. Our server was terrible and had no idea how to explain some of the food on the menu. Our appetizer came out with the meal (there were only two tables left so it was not busy). The food was okay... But not what I expected for the price. I will only come back here for drinks and the view."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere on a warm day or evening.  Oysters were good, only had apps so can't comment on the entrees yet, I will be going back soon for a full meal.  Expect to valet if you go here, not much parking in the area.  Lots of great bars located right across the street."}
{"text":"Not ready yet. If you order a bottled beer... or a bottle of wine, that seems fine, but the bartenders are either shockingly slow or there aren't enough of them.  It was bad enough that it took like a half an hour to get our drinks (2 of them) - but when they arrived, the lemon twist turned into a slice of lime.  So, incompetence from the bar began an excruciating experience that didn't get much better.  The food was fine, but that took forever, and what mystified me was that two tables of four (on either side) ate and left before we even got our appetizers... same waiter, so go figure.  I'd wait a few weeks for them to get fully, and competently staffed.  Maybe Zack rushed the opening before the short Cleveland summer ends.  Very disappointing. Floor manager 'comped' the food, but you can't take the bad taste out of your mouth when a noted restauranteur stumbles like this.  Looks like Amanda L. had the exact same experience as me... see her review."}
{"text":"Good food horrible service. Horrible service to the point where you don't want to come back and it outweighs the good food and nice atmosphere. We were there on a Sunday for lunch and were one of three tables. It took us over 30 mins to get our food and our waiter barley paid any attention to us. The friends we were with also had two prior bad experiences here. They got three chances, not coming back."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian, this isn't a place I'd seek out for myself, but my husband enjoys seafood so we had brunch here one day.  The big draw to this place is its location.  We enjoyed our meal outside in the shade (and mayflys, but some things can't be helped) and watched people kayaking on the river and the passing of a big cargo boat.  As for the food, I enjoyed my French toast. The bananas were well cooked into the toast and the peanut butter taste was not too overwhelming.  The bread itself could have been fluffier, but clearly, breakfast is not this place's specialty.  I also had a side of creamed corn which was delicious. It wasn't too creamy and was flavored with more citrus and cilantro so very refreshing.   My husband enjoyed his lobster roll and was intrigued by some of the other fish options so I'm sure he would be happy to return. We had no issue with the service.  If they added just another option for us vegetarians who accompany seafood lovers, I'd be happy to give this place another go."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and FABULOUS food. The atmosphere is wonderful too - hip, fun, classic. You can't beat the views. I ordered the halibut with lobster cream - delicious. My husband had the charred octopus and really enjoyed his meal. The kitchen even made our young son a meal better suited for his picky tastes (plain cheese quesadilla). I tried some new oysters I had not yet heard of (very tasty) and was pleasantly surprised that among the raw horseradish and cocktail sauce, they also serve a vinegar + shallot sauce. (I don't always see it served with oysters, and I love it!) The charred broccoli ceaser was one of the best salads I've ever had - very unique and flavorful take on a traditional meal starter. Thank you for such a fantastic evening!"}
{"text":"First time Alley Cat diner. Based upon the reviews here and through the PD, we needed to give the place a try.   We started at a moderate pace ordering the fish sandwich and lobster roll. Both were disappointing. The bun for the lobster roll was soggy and fell apart. The fish sandwich was overwhelmed by the slaw and cilantro making every bite stringy and unappealing.   The service was good, too good. We sat, ordered our drinks and food and were finished in about 35 minutes. The food came out about 10 minutes from the time we ordered. Which was surprisingly fast given the place was packed. For a draft, one glass of wine and two sandwiches we paid $58 and were in and out in 45.   I felt three stars was generous and if not for the hard working wait staff could justify two."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and bar located right on the water. Came here on a Friday afternoon around 5 to catch the happy hour. They have great specials including $4 wines and $7 generous portioned loaded fries. We easily found a seat at the bar during happy hour however when we asked for a table, they had a 2 hour wait. Alley Cat was packed by 6pm however we were determined to get a table so we ended up waiting the 2 hours for a seat outside overlooking the water. Food items and drinks were a little bit on the pricey side after happy hour however everything was delicious and the view was gorgeous on a sunny day. This is definitely a place I would return to for happy hour at the bar but would probably skip getting a table at for dinner due to long wait times."}
{"text":"I didn't think Cleveland could serve good ceviche, but Alley Cat has done it. I also had the toasted grain bowl and it was very good and not too dense as so many quinoa dishes are. The shrimp cocktail had the biggest shrimps I think I've ever seen. Very good too! If you're like me and don't care for oysters, I still recommend Alley Cat!"}
{"text":"Great oysters and seared Tuna entree. Good atmosphere and service at the bar. Will come back when I'm in Downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Overall, Alley Cat offers some decent (but uneven) food in a casual but picturesque dining room, highlighted by the garage door walls that open up onto the Cuyahoga River.  I really enjoyed the Grilled Octopus, which was surprisingly tender and served with a cassoulet-like mix of ham and beans.  Understanding the look of octopus on the plate is not for everyone, I strongly recommend the willing to give this dish a try.  Unfortunately, the other foods I tasted did not live up to the octopus:  The Crispy Oysters off the happy hour menu were small and primarily composed of breading.  The Hush Puppies tasted off, being mixed with some chili powder (something that should be disclosed on the menu).  The Baked Oysters were merely lukewarm but did come with a little bit of sauce and butter for taste.  On the other hand, the Calamari was good and a step up from the generic calamari you get at non-seafood specialty restaurants.  Despite the disappointments with the side dishes, Alley Cat deserves a solid \"A-OK\" rating, driven primarily by the Grilled Octopus and scenic views--not to mention the variety of oysters available to taste."}
{"text":"The location and views make this place a good destination for a drink and oysters. However, with that said, that's all I would order. The grilled octopus was over cooked you couldn't cut it with a knife. The manager's response was sending out a free dessert - which by the way wasn't good either. It was some banana dessert that tasted like Jello pudding. The mussel bisque was good at first taste, then as you began to eat more if it, an overpowering taste of butter kicked in and any seafood flavor was gone. Another thing to note was the oysters had a lot of shells in them. I was constantly pulling pieces of shell out of my mouth which was not a fun experience. This place needs to get a grasp on seafood culinary skills and master their customer service. We spent almost 800.00 there and the four people who had octopus all complained and they couldn't take it off the bill, as I stated above, their response was free dessert that tasted horrible. When you're spending that much, you would think there would be some sort of customer service provided."}
{"text":"Very cool new spot in the Flats. Great decor overlooking the water. Apps were all great. Main courses were not good. Nothing was special, very average food. Our server made it worse. She must have been having a bad day. Not sure about going back there. It won't be for a long time. I hope they improve things & do great."}
{"text":"i'm thrilled that the restaurant is here in our neighborhood. it's a bit on the loud side, but i am a bit on the old side. i've eaten there twice and there are rough edges but hopefully in time that will iron out as they are still on the new side. my #1 fave thing that i'd go back for again and again is that grilled broccoli caesar salad. please do not change it! it was awesome. oysters need to be more carefully shucked - little bits of shell detract. but the people who work there are lovely. they are aiming to please and doing a great job in that regard... being that the place is new, i'm going to give it another shot soon! the view on the river is fab. when the ships go by it's worth just being there!"}
{"text":"Yikes. Service was awful. Waited almost an hour for appetizers (after talking with a manager nonetheless). Still waiting for our main course...ordered an hour ago... Food is good-hence the 2 stars. Worth a 2 hour wait? Nope."}
{"text":"If there is an option to give a negative review, I would give minus 10 stars review for this restaurant. I can say that the food was decent, but the service was totally horrendous!!!  The server, whose name is Sarah, only cared about having you ordered expensive food on the menu so that she could get a big tip!  I came to Cleveland for a visit and I have been to almost all of Zack Bruell's restaurants in Cleveland, until I came here then I realized it was totally a waste of time and money!  So, it was Sunday afternoon at around 3:45-4pm. Sarah, who was our server, gave us the restaurant week menu and the regular menu. She left and came back about 15-20 minutes later. We started looking at the menu and we noticed that the menu has a 'Happy Hour 3-6 Daily' together with the list of the happy hour meals and drinks. I then mentioned to her that we would like to order the 'restaurant week' 3 courses of meals and some of the happy hour meals and drinks. I was surprised when she looked very unhappy when I mentioned about happy hour menu. She said we are not supposed to order from the happy hour menu, the happy hour price are only for people sitting in the bar. I was very surprised because we she did not explain to us until we placed an order nor does the restaurant put a sign anywhere in the menu and in the restaurant itself.  (I asked the manager later, he confirmed that we could order happy hour menu without having to sit at the bar)  Here when her responses was really shocked me: She kept saying that the price in the happy hour is 'not much different' compared to the regular menu. She then gave an example that oyster is $2 for happy hour and $2.95 in the regular menu. I was really shocked when she kept saying 'NOT MUCH DIFFERENT', because from $2 to $2.95 is almost 50% increase in price!! Then I asked her about the wine, which is $4 for happy hour and $8 on average in the regular menu.  Again, she replied that we are not supposed to order from the happy hour menu and the price is 'NOT MUCH DIFFERENT' (from $4 to $8 is 100% increase in price!!!). Finally, reluctantly, she said that she could take order from happy hour but not the drink.  We then ordered 'Bloody Mary' for drinks (since she would not let us order drinks from happy hour menu), 3 courses from the Restaurant Week menu, 2 courses from regular menu and 2 courses from happy hour menu. When I asked her about the Hamachi Collar, she said that the portion is very small. I was not sure if she was trying to discourage me from ordering something that is not 'very expensive', or it is because of her lack of knowledge about the food that the restaurant serves. Because the Hamachi Collar's portion was actually big.  I have to tell you that the food in the Alley Cat restaurant was good, but the service was extremely poor. The service was super slow, the server almost never came back to check our table, when she did check our table THE ONLY THING SHE CARED WAS asking if we would like to order more drink. Because of the slowness of the service (considered that the restaurant was not busy at all at that time) we then decided to take the dessert home. But again, we had to wait for another 25 minutes just for a dessert that was already pre-made and could just be grabbed from the refrigerator.  WE COULD NOT WAIT TO LEAVE!!!  Overall, our afternoon was ruined by the service here: THE SERVER ATTITUDE WAS VERY BAD, it seemed that she did not even want to work at this restaurant. She was lucky that my boyfriend is a very generous guy and still gave her a 15% tips which she did not deserve it at all !!! With her constant comments of 'not much difference in the price', I think 'with tips' and 'no tips' should also make no difference to her! Moreover, we were charge an additional $2 for the Bloody Mary, but we just did not want to spend any more time to ask the server about it. It was not about the $2, the thing that bother us the most was that the server should have explained up front any additional charges when we placed the order.  WE WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS RESTAURANT WITH CRAP HOLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Came in with no reservation just around 3:45 on a Monday. A few people at the bar and a table of 6 were sitting. Otherwise  it was empty. They had some upbeat jazz playing.  Food: all served in a timely manner. The starter bread is really good. Very soft and fresh.  Clam chowder is chunky with lots of ingrediants. Full bodied. Best way to have it. Oysters were perfectly shucked.  Civiche was tasty, large chunks of fish.  Happy Hour is 3-6pm.  Drinks: Very limited selection for happy hour beverages. Nice selection of regular priced wine, bourbon and whisky  Service: casually friendly, quiet, polite. I noted I would split the octopus entree with my boyfriend and they split it on two plated for us before serving. That was a nice touch.  All in all, it was good. I left full and happy."}
{"text":"My husband and I came kind of on a whim after walking past earlier in the weekend. I am very familiar with Zack Bruell's restaurants and was very excited to try Alley Cat. We walked right in on a Monday evening with no reservation and were able to get a wonderful patio table. The views out there are incredible! Our server was attentive, knowledgable, and friendly.   We opted to share several items as to get a nice sampling of the menu. We tried all 4 varieties of oysters, the ceviche, and the beef tar tar. Our sever coursed them out for us and it was all timed and spaced perfectly. We never felt rushed or had more than one item on our table at a time. Everything tasted wonderful and was presented beautifully. We finished our meal with the key lime pie. It was the perfect refreshing end to the meal on a warm summer night.   Our only critiques, the kitchen forgot the tuna in the ceviche. It was very quickly fixed and brought back to us. With an apology from the manager himself. It was actually more comical than anything. My husband and I wondered if we just didn't read the menu close enough and it was a vegetarian ceviche! The second critique would be the crust on the key lime pie, although utterly delicious, it was terribly hard. Just very difficult to break through without feeling like a piece was going to go flying.   All that said, we will come back, and we will recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, the service was slow asked for pepper twice before someone brought it. Ran out of my drink took almost 20 minutes just to get someone's attention. A few of us wanted dessert and the waiter brings everyone's bill without asking if we wanted dessert.  Could have stayed in Akron and had a better experience.  Decor and location was nice."}
{"text":"We used to live in the Flats - unfortunately all of these wonderful developments occurred after we moved out! We love going back though. We've been to Alley Cat a couple of times and both have not disappointed. The outdoor patio is right on the water and is perfect to accompany the Cleveland summers. The food was was of the level one may have learned to expect from Zack Bruell (he is dominating the Flats with this and Collision Bend!) We had the fresh oysters, \"tater tots,\" chicken papaya salad, seafood mac and cheese, chili braised beef, and chocolate caramel cake. The only one that was subpar was the beef. Excellent service and view - would definitely recommend checking out!"}
{"text":"I've been to Alley Cat a few times, but went most recently over the weekend with a friend. I made reservations since it was the weekend and we had an event to attend after. We were seated right away once we arrived. However, it took a little while for our waiter to show up and once he did he took a while to take drink orders, bring the drinks and take our orders. We started off with the calamari which was very good. My friend and I both ordered the lobster rolls and substituted the fries for green beans since we already had something fried with the calamari. I had been waiting to order the lobster roll here until I made a trip to Boston and tried it fresh there, but this was almost just as good. The bread it came on was amazing too. Word of advice- there is something spicy in the green beans. They were very good, but if you can't handle spice I would suggest not ordering them.   We placed our dinner order after our appetizer order and our waiter came to check on us as we were eating our appetizer and we were almost done but still kind of nibbling at it. He asked if he could take it away, but we still wanted it there. It wasn't until he came back a second time that he said they don't start the lobster rolls until appetizers are finished. Which I thought was strange because I've been here when people ordered apps and the roll before and never heard that. The waiter seemed very awkward and unpersonable so it was all kind of strange.   Overall, I'd say this is a great seafood restaurant. It's a good addition to downtown Cleveland and the updated Flats. I like the ambiance and the location right on the river. It does get dark inside the restaurant at night and it can be hard to read the menus. If you come here in the summer they open up the windows along the side of the restaurant. They also have an upstairs patio that I've been wanting to go to in the summer."}
{"text":"This is such a great place in the flats!!!  I really enjoyed my time last night @alley cat!  My husband and I shared a nice bottle Caravan cab (it was so delicious and full bodied) we ordered some oyster and the beef tartar to start. Oysters were good (not $3 a piece good, ya know your typical oyster) but the tartar was great very yummy!   For my dinner I ordered the lobster roll ( I'm such a sucker for a good lobster roll) and this place doesn't disappoint! Nice big chunks of meat and a very delicious sauce, it's a easy choice if your having a hard time deciding and I subbed the fries for a salad.  My husband on the other hand ordered the halibut collar which he didn't really care for. It was a bit charred on the outside and under cooked on the inside. Our server was so nice she seen it was a bit under cooked and took it off the bill, she also gave us a complimentary dessert! She was great!!! (I wish I got her name, cute blonde with a nose ring!)  All in all we had a really nice time. We sat downstairs by the window watching the boats go by and the lights from across the river."}
{"text":"View, A*, Service, A+, Food, A++. Best dining experience on the West Bank!! You are in Cleveland, people, so if you're expecting Florida seafood you will of course be disappointed. But seafood was fresh and the staff is so professional and attentive. Love love love this place!!"}
{"text":"Tried dinner here on a weeknight during the winter.  Trendy ambiance.  The type of oysters available change on a daily basis.  Good selection of appetizers.  Nice selection of seafood entrees and sides.  All were well prepared.  Service was attentive.  I plan another trip back in the warm weather when the outdoor seating is open."}
{"text":"I just moved here and it was the first place I took my family for dinner. Fantastic food and great service! We sat right by the windows and has a view of the river. It was beautiful. I would recommend the raw oysters and beef tartare. Great wine list, too!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of state and we're almost decided against going here with a 3 Star, but glad we did.  We went on a Tuesday night and at about 5:30 we had the place to ourselves.  I saw 5 other restaurants on the pier so know there is competition, but do recommend it.  We're from the NW and use to oysters there. The waiter recommended the NE oysters and they were some of the best we've ever had.  We both ordered the swordfish and was pretty good.  On all of our dishes they were too heavy on the salt.  If this was cut back we would of given 5 stars.   The location is great, right on the pier and a great ambience and view!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!!! I was told how great this place was and I was beyond underwhelmed by the food and the service.  We had a reservation on Sunday at 630. We arrived early to let them know we were in the area. At 6:20 she told us the table would be ready in 10min and we would get a text. So we decided to go for a walk and would come back right away...come 640..still no text. We head back inside and she asks for our name again as if she didn't just speak to us. We wait another 5min for her to figure things out and grab a table.  Once seated at a table we notice there is no place setting at all. So while we are sitting there the busboy come by and places everything on the table in front of us and we had to help him with it... we then wait 7minutes for him to come back to fill the water glasses. 3mins after that (10min total from when we sat) the waiter finally shows up... We place drink orders and oyster orders. The waiter did a great job explaining the oysters to us... unfortunately they gave some of us the wrong menu with oysters that weren't even available... sweet.  We then placed our entree orders a bit later. I was u sure what to get so I asked about the salmon. He said it was good... I asked where the salmon was from and he hesitated, I then asked what kind of salmon and he said it was FARM RAISED!!!! They wanted $28 for a farm raised salmon filet!  I ordered the \"most popular\" item instead, the lobster roll. The roll was underwhelming. Not much lobster and the \"roll\" wasn't much of a roll at all. I've had a better lobster roll at Steubens in Denver, which is land locked...  This place is a scam. Just because they charge $$$ doesn't make it good.   I'm getting frustrated with the food scene here in Cleveland. Not very good at all"}
{"text":"The view is the best part about this place. I had the fish sandwich and it was pretty average.  Food here is over priced for the quality.  You're paying for the location.  There are far better places to eat nearby like Willeyville.  But stunning view, I'll probably return for a predinner drink or app but dine elsewhere for my main meal."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Zack Bruell fan, and Alley Cat didn't disappoint. I had the shrimp stuffed peppers which were a little more spicy than I anticipated, but delicious non the less. I also had the crab cakes, which were quite possibly the best I've ever had. Great place to go with friends or date night."}
{"text":"Can you give negative stars? Went for Saturday lunch, seriously and I have to say I have never seen a restaurant so under staffed.  Waited 30 minutes to be acknowledged by our waitress, like even a nod from across the room but just gave up. We lasted longer than the table next to us though. Silver lining??  Seriously needs to figure out both how to staff properly and how to train their current staff."}
{"text":"I would have loved to give them a better review, but... I just can't. Food was OK. Service was...meh. I felt very rushed. We were in & out of there in an hour, granted it was a Tuesday evening, but for $150 dinner for 2, I would have loved to have had an \"experience\", not just food served quickly. Our server left for the evening as soon as we paid, so I guess that's why we were rushed.  Nothing was bad, except the bar tender was literally screaming multiple times talking with her customers at the bar, and it was so dark at our table, we had to get our phones out to read the menu (no candle on the table or light within 10 feet of our table!)  So we won't be returning. We love fresh oysters, but we'll go back to Blue point Grill for those."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!! I brought 7 friends here for a surprise birthday dinner on a Thursday night excited to experience one of the new restaurants in the build out of the East Bank Flats. Having no real expectations, the group and I were blown away by how awful the service was...and that no one there seemed to give a damn. We arrived at 8:45 PM and the restaurant seemed to be slow in terms of how many guests were there this night. I sat down and ordered a Jack on the rocks and a beer for a friend...it was 20 min before we received  our first drinks and I had to ask if they were even being made to another server who came by with water. After we finally got our drinks a server came by with bread and chose to give each of us a single slice of bread out of the basket he was holding...so I asked if we could just have a basket of bread and was taken back by the servers reaction who was very hesitant and had to check with his manager if he could provide our table with a basket of bread....strange to say the least. Needless to say, we were off to a bad start, but I hopeful that one of our 6 servers (we never knew who was really serving us because there was a new person who came to our table every time) would work with us to turn this experience around and make it a positive one. We started with appetizers and waited patiently for 50 min. before we received any of them. Following our 50 min wait on apps we then waited another 40 min. before our dinner came. Usually I would understand the extended wait time of the food at a restaurant, as I have worked in many as a server and cook...but the restaurant seemed slow with very few people eating. After the terrible service continued I approached a man who was standing near the front of the restaurant and approached him and asked if he worked there, he informed me that he did so I asked for a manager. His response was \"what can I help you with?\" I informed him about our poor service up to this point and expressed how disappointed I was. His response only made things worse...he goes \"Ok. I will see what I can do to speed things up.\" He did not seem to give a shit about the fact that his customers were having terrible service and the bad impression it was leaving. After all was said and done it was time to pay the bill and we all sat and waiting another 30 min. for the checks (I had to go take the checks to the manager himself and ask if we could please pay our bill because no one was coming to take them). The lady who was helping us comes back to our table and goes \"This is sad, it was supposed to all be on one bill and gratuity was supposed to be added!!!! As if that was our fault and we were the ones who put the checks together....I couldn't believe how rude she was and will never visit this place again, and advise others to not have your hopes up."}
{"text":"Came here with friends on a Saturday afternoon for drinks & sushi. Great atmosphere right on the water. The sushi is SO good- highly recommend the eel roll."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 2 people on a Friday evening and we were seated right away. The service was great, the waitress was very attentive. I ordered the clam chowder appetizer, which was chock-full of corn with barely any clams in it and quite salty. For the entree I ordered the 1 lb grilled  lobster tail with a side of cole slaw and fries. Fries were good, but not salted and the cole slaw was very bland, absolutely no taste. The lobster tail was way over cooked so it was tough. I feel when I'm paying $60 for a lobster dinner, it should be pretty awesome and it unfortunately wasn't. So, good service but food was not all that and very overpriced for the quality"}
{"text":"We had to wait a bit longer than usual for our reservation table, however the manager made it up to us with a complimentary bottle of champagne for the bride to be and sat us in the private room. It was an awesome setting with wonderful service and delicious food."}
{"text":"only three oysters to choose from.  no one was avaialble to tell me what was what on my plate.  baked oysters were heated and thats about it.  they need a chargrilled option.  raw were fine but the oysters were not even shucked properly.  service was not great.  if you have never been to a real oyster house then you might like it. if you have been to real oyster houses in other parts of the country then you probably will go here one time and never go back."}
{"text":"PROS -Location, location, location. With the rise of the Flats, Alley Cat is one of the big winners when it comes to location. They are right next to the boardwalk/river and the majority of tables have a view of the Cuyahoga River. The opening of the garage-style windows instantly make the indoors feel like a patio. -See food, seafood. Probably one of the biggest seafood menus in the Cleveland area, IMO. They had 5-6 catches of the day, including my fav, tuna (which I got). They have an oyster menu. And then more entrees that include seafood. So if you like seafood, you have plenty of options. -Calamari. One of the better calamari dishes I've had in awhile. I am not a fan of red sauce with calamari, so I was happy to find that this was served with an aioli. There was something else spicy on the side (I avoided it). And large leafs of cilantro. All dishes should be served with large leafs of cilantro. -Tuna. While it was not the best tuna I've ever had in my life, it was still pretty solid. I would recommend ordering it as rare as it comes.  CONS -Shooter's, go home, you're drunk. When your across-the-river neighbor is Shooter's, aka that frat house who leaves beer cans in the front yard, you're gonna run into some hiccups. As I mentioned above, the garage doors open to make it feel like a patio. While we were there, Alley Cat had to close the doors, not because of weather, but because Shooter's music was so loud that it was disrupting the atmosphere at Alley Cat. -Seafood. I'm just throwing it out there in case you don't like seafood. The menu is mostly made up of creatures from the sea, so if that's not your thing, your options will be limited.  BOTTOM LINE I see food, you see food, we all seafood. And then want to eat that food in this cool and trendy restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a lot of positives going for it. There are beautiful views from almost anywhere in it. The staff is very nice, well trained and attentive. The ingredients are all fresh and delicious. The need for improvement is in the dishes executions. The menu has some very creative and interesting choices but the finishing touches are way to heavy on the sauces. The chef needs to hold back and exercise some restraint on the finishing sauces and let the proteins and ingredients speak for themselves. I really loved the grilled octopus dinner I ate it was just way over sauced and that drowned out the perfectly cooked octopus. The same went for the baked oysters appetizer it had great flavors just to much of them exercise some restraint and this restaurant will be great!"}
{"text":"Creative menu. Excellent selection of seafood especially the fish items. It was very crowded so we ate at the bar. Service was excellent. The draft beer selection was very good. I would return."}
{"text":"Ate on the roof. As mediocre as it gets. Deserves only 3 stars. Overdressed calamari salad. Ok for Cleveland."}
{"text":"We went here last night after reading the review in the Plain Dealer. I made reservations a week ahead and asked for a table by the windows to which we did not get, yet there was open ones around us(my husband hates switching tables and making a fuss or I would have asked to move). We asked about several dishes that were recommended in the paper but slightly different on the nights menu to which our waiter said \"bland, wouldn't recommend\". It would've been ok but he only recommended 3 dishes on the entire menu. We ordered appetizers which came out so fast and he kept asking to take our dinner order that we felt rushed which was not enjoyable at all. He had no personality and I think just wanted to turn tables. If you go, I would recommend the calamari app, the pea pod salad, and the grilled octopus entree which were all good but pricey restaurant for experience."}
{"text":"Talk about rushed.   We were seated given bread and water and took the drink order.  At the same time asked about appetizers and those requests were taken as well.   Within 2 minutes the appetizer was at our table which means they were already prepared.  No biggie because apps can be quick but not when they are fried and have to be cooked.  Immediately came over and asked for dinner order.  I'm not joking but literally 4 minutes later they were at our table with entrees.  I still had the appetizer plates on our tiny table.  Still no drink that I ordered initially.  The food was reminiscent of a food truck.  Lobster roll was fancier buttered and toasted hot dog bun with a few pieces of what I think was lobster in it.  And a gargantuan helping of French fries to fill up the plate.  Most fries were clumped together and over cooked.  Again evidence that everything seemed precooked.  Overall overpriced for the food quality and speed.  Don't order the lobster roll.  Clam chowder was good.  Nice location and beautiful view.  Sit outside if you decide to eat here."}
{"text":"Simply amazing!!!! We were in Cleveland for Memorial Day Weekend and expected everything to be packed and made reservations here via OpenTable after reading reviews and seeing its location on the water! I'm a sucker for a water view!   We started with the Seafood Charcuterie board and it was interesting... items we'd never think to order (like seafood sausage) but was pleasantly surprised with everything offered on it! A great way to kick off our meal!  I ordered the scallops entree. Flavorful carrot purée with roasted tomatoes and onions. Boyfriend ordered the tuna entree, it came with udon noodles and veg. He said it was amazing as well!   Our view was amazing sitting on the patio, good covering too. No direct sun on us at all with a nice breeze!"}
{"text":"So glad this place opened. Right in the river. Great new Flats development.  Lobster roll and King Crab legs were awesome!   I'm coming back soon to try out the rooftop patio which looks fantastic"}
{"text":"Yum, yum and yummm. My new favorite restaurant. I visited Alley Cat Oyster Bar with my boyfriend for my birthday. The restaurant has cool decor and over looks the water. We sat at the bar per usual and to our surprise they had drink and oyster specials. I of course got both because come on who doesn't like cheap drinks and oysters. We also got calamari which was so tasty. Great experience and can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"We started with the hush puppies. So salty we could not Choke them down. They did take them off the bill. The fried chicken was all fried skin and no meat. The pork steak was so tough it was hard to cut, let alone chew. Lobster roll was ok but sparse on the lobster. We had been here before and the food was very good. This time it was very disappointing.  One good point... The oysters and fries were good."}
{"text":"First things first!!  Perfect location!!!  Restaurant is off the water near the docks!  And surrounded by serene landscape.  Well rounded menu!!  Knowledgeable and courteous wait staff.  Food was pretty good as well.  Raw oysters were tasty and fresh.  Lobster roll was seasoned well...but more of an appetizer than an entree.  Food presentation was impressive.  We ate outside on the patio.  All was going well until I looked down and saw a bowl of water for another patrons dog that matched the China I was eating off of!  ARE THEY SERIOUS???"}
{"text":"Today is my birthday and we came here for my birthday dinner... and I wish we didn't. You guys know I rarely give less then stellar reviews, ever, because I hate doing it.  Before my birthday dinner, I called early to confirm and to ask if the 4 of us could be seated near the patio, because we're having a celebration, and that would be lovely. The gal on the phone got oddly feisty with me, cut me off, and told me they make no guarantees about seating with reservations. That's fine, but it was so awkward, I had to cut her off in return and instinctively said, \"I'm sorry, I was just asking, it's not a big deal, i'm sorry.\"  When we arrived, it didn't improve. Our server seemed very unhappy to be with us, and was so low energy it was uncomfortable. This was our first time for dinner, and he didn't walk us through anything, and wanted to immediately take our order. I don't expect to be babied, but maybe i'm unusual (?) because i'm not a person who can see \"NJ Oysters\" \"Capital Oysters\" etc, and know what they're like with no description. We had to keep prying for answers to questions regarding pricing and flavors for various menu items, even beyond oysters. Awkward.  I did enjoy my Lobster Roll. When we were served dinner, my brother ordered a beer. It took so long to come, that by the time it arrived, all 3 of us were done with our meals (he wanted his beer with dinner). We also asked for a few other things that never came. As I type this, I also received the \"naughty\" e-mail from the reservation system saying they marked me as a no-show, and asking \"What happened?\"  Overall, the food is good if you're in the area and would like seafood. I recommend Alley Cat if you're coming with friends for apps and can put up with the experience, but I do not recommend it for any type of celebration or client entertaining because you will leave feeling sad like me, and with a HUGE bill. :( Many sad faces for this birthday girl."}
{"text":"Unhappy hour is when you're seated on the patio only to be told that you're not on the \"happy hour patio\". Pretentious new place on the east bank of the flats. Unfortunately the staff can't even tell you the difference between 3 types of oysters. View is nice, oysters were good for Cleveland, but they have a long way to go if they expect to be in business more than a year."}
{"text":"So let me start off with saying that I didn't eat here.  My boyfriend and I came here for some drinks on a Sunday night as something new to do. The bartenders were super friendly and conversational. I honestly don't care how much I pay for a drink, if the bartenders actually try to hold a conversation with me. These bartenders delivered. And for that alone.... I am very impressed. Although it was close to closing time, never did I feel like they were trying to push us out. I would absolutely recommend this place for a hip night-cap. The atmosphere is both sexy and industrial which completely encompasses Cleveland as a whole. I totally dig this place. I will definitely come back and try the food."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar...great ambience. Great wine list. Great location on Cayuhoga River.  Alley Cat Oysters yummy."}
{"text":"When I think of \"Alley Cats\" I think of cats rummaging through garbage looking for dinner.  When you combine that together with \"Oyster Bar\" - it makes that storyline come alive - but fortunately, there were no alley cats at the bar eating oysters!  We got there for happy hour, we were promptly greeted and seated at a table on their wonderful patio on the river. Fortunately we were both in summer attire, it was a beautiful day with plenty of warmth and sunshine.  Our server Katie was fabulous.  I challenged her on selecting a wine, giving her a basic idea of what we were looking for.  She was quick on her feet and suggested a bottle of something not on the list.  It was a perfect Chardonnay for a summer day.  We enjoyed it in the sunshine over beautiful river views and great conversation.  We both had some small plates which were excellent - the Calamari and the Tartare.  I found them both to be well prepared and tasty.  With the abundance of great restaurants in Cleveland, and great chefs - sometimes service makes the difference between a good experience and a great experience.  I highly recommend checking this place out, sit on the patio and enjoy some sunshine great food and great service."}
{"text":"Food was amazing as usual but it wasn't t a Zachary Bruelle. Experience. Service was good like a normal dining experience not phenomenal like Zachary restaurants are. Maybe it was an off night this happens at the best places. I sat at bar too which I normally don t do. Do come to this place it s amazing 9out of 10. On the river experience is very nice to."}
{"text":"don't get the crab cake....unfortunately i made this mistake earlier in the summer, and i made it again tonite.   the crab cake's are 1 part crab, 10 parts stuffing.   I've been to alley cat about 10 times this summer...the location is great...but i wish zach would step up the food quality.  i've been dining at his restaurants since he had Z in beachwood a million years ago.  Zach if you read this, please fix your crab cake."}
{"text":"Our wedding anniversary today. Went on the Nautica Queen Lunch after that. Been wanting to go. Hostess, certainly wasn't the hostesses with the mostess. Wanted to be outside, unfortunately all the tables were not bussed.  Went to another location, similar dirty tables. Food was good(fish sandwich & lobster roll. Didn't care for the ambiance at all. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I am really disappointed to have to write this review.  The first time was wonderful.  Not so much with the second and now the third visits.   I didn't post a negative review after the second visit as I thought the poor service and lukewarm food was a fluke.  There is an overall lack of consistency in food and service at Alley Cat.  On the third visit (Sunday, 8/21) we were seated and received bread and water immediately.   We were actually joking that we would drink the water and eat the bread, leave and go find another restaurant where we could get waited on because we were now waiting nearly 15 minutes.  The server arrives, takes our drink orders, delivers the drinks and takes the food order.  My husband ordered 8 oysters and received 6.  We decided to split the 1 pound lobster tail and asked for green beans instead of fries.  There is no way what we got was a 1 pound tail but oh well.  My husband tries to loosen the meat from the shell and he's fighting with this thing.  He said, I don't know what's wrong with this thing but I can't get this meat away from the shell.  After several minutes of fighting with it he got some meat out of it.  It was so unbelievably salty it was inedible and I'm a girl that likes salty.  I had two others at the table taste a small bite and all were in agreement, something was wrong.  Green beans stone cold.  Our server took the lobster back to the kitchen.   The manager came over a few minutes later and apologized saying he didn't know if someone was just heavy handed with the salt in the kitchen and then further into our discussion said they don't salt the lobsters before grilling them.  It just was not a good experience at all.  The last two visits the food came out piece meal and was not good.  There are too many other nice places with a view of the water to go back to Alley Cat for mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"Bad dining experience, do not recommend this place for a dinner date.  May not be a bad place to grab a drink with some friends but horrible date experience.  Very crowded.  Reservation was for 8:45, didn't get sat until 9:15 - didn't see a server until 9:30.  Our two entrees were the Fried Chicken and Seafood pasta dish;  The chicken itself was good but the sauce and side were inedible and the pasta tasted like it came out of a box with no seasoning. We sent both dinners back, and just asked for our check because we had enough. The ONLY reason i am not giving 1 star is the fact that the manager was extremely apologetic, comp'd our whole bill and offered to have us back again on the house.  Kudos to the manager on trying to save this place - if i were him i would be looking for somewhere else to work because good talent is being wasted for him...  Save yourself and just go eat at Punch Bowl Social if you are looking for a night out on the East bank of the flats..."}
{"text":"Nice view. Oysters were disappointingly small. I had the baked oyster appetizer and 3 of the oysters were no bigger than a Nickel and the other two were the size of a quarter."}
{"text":"Loved the oysters! Very good quality, beautiful view. It was very busy for a Tuesday night. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars from me is the service. The wait staff was very friendly and efficient, but the wait time between ordering and getting our food was unbearable. We were there three hours for a three course meal.  If the oysters would come out quicker, I would be dropping many hundreds of dollars here per visit, that's for damn sure."}
{"text":"Very disappointing food and service. Definitely not up to par for a Bruell restaurant. It wreaks of tourist trappings. We have been there twice, including taking visitors from out of town. We were embarrassed. Except for the oysters at $3 a pop, everything else tasted like it could have come from Applebee's, including a soggy crab cake, disgusting quesadillas, and underwhelming seafood salad. Don't waste your time or money here. Oh, and the service was downright rude. I HATE having to beg for a piece of bread."}
{"text":"I'll start with the good. The seafood is very fresh and what I've tried has been well prepared. I'd echo the people who wish there were more than a handful of types of oysters, but what's there is quite fresh. So two stars is pretty harsh for a place with good food, but the service here is frenetic and mediocre at best. This may be coloring my review (it's definitely coloring my shirt), but a busser dropped a ramekin of ketchup that exploded on my table and a few other tables around me. He pretended it didn't happen. Took until I left to know that Jackson Pollack took a swing at my shirt. Sadly, this is emblematic of overall service. Ordered a second round, got a completely different drink. Plates were yanked from under people so we felt rushed. Finally, really pushing this from three to two stars: it's damn expensive for the level of service. I understand that sea creatures are pricey but the value isn't there, despite the nice location. I'm a big Zack Bruell fan, and I hope they get their shit together here, but until I hear otherwise, this is on my no-fly list."}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary at Alley Cat on Jan 16th.  We have been wanting to dine there for awhile.  We thoroughly enjoyed our experience!  We started off with 9 raw oysters.  That was the only real disappointment.  They only offer 3 different types of oysters.  I would expect a bigger variety from a place that calls itself an Oyster Bar.  Having said that, the oysters were fresh, briny and so tasty!  We also had the ceviche.  It was fresh and wonderful.  My only other complaint was, the restaurant was so dark, we could not fully see what we were eating!  My husband had the Lobster Roll for his entree.  He said that it was the best he ever tasted.  That is saying quite a lot!  I had the  Rainbow Trout, which was perfectly cooked.  Our server was attentive and funny without being overbearing.  He made some great suggestions.  He was an asset to Alley Cat!  We will definitely go back.  And want to experience it in the Summer.  Wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Even if you are not an oyster fan, this is still a good place to stop by for happy hour or other dish options. Rooftop is a great place to hang out and a good view of the city when it is open."}
{"text":"Went to Alley Cat last night to use up a gift card.  I'm not a huge fan of Zack Bruell restaurants, finding them over-priced, pretentious, with just 'meh' food, and not so great service, so I might have arrived a little skeptical, and unfortunately my prior experience was borne out once again.   We had reservations for 8:30, and arrived right on time, but were told that the table wasn't ready yet and that they would send a text message when it was ready.  That's fine, I understand if you need to clear a table and we were ready to wait a few minutes.  We ended up taking a walk around the flats, and after 20 minutes, with still no message, we went back to Alleycat, and asked what the wait was.  They just said the table was ready, but with no apology or explanation for the delay.    We were seated, and it took a while before water was served, we never received the bread that other tables seemed to be getting, and then the waiter was impossible to track down during the meal.  My wife wanted a second cocktail but wasn't able to order it until near the end of the meal.    The food was fine, but nothing to write home about.  I had the charred broccoli salad which was quite good, but the burger was uninspired.  My wife had the swordfish, and there wasn't much flavor on the tiny 2oz piece of fish, let alone the rest of the entree.    I'm not sure why Clevelanders keep going to Bruell restaurants when there are so many better options in town."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night around 9...the place was extremely dead which I found odd.  I know its slow season for restaurants but I expected it to be busy since the flats always seems to be now.  Service was great, oysters were good along with mussels and crab cake appetizer.  Also tried to octopus, ceviche, and fried chicken.  All were good dishes but nothing that has me dying to come back.  Service was quick, food was moderately priced.  The weirdest thing was they called me 15 minutes before my reservation to confirm it."}
{"text":"Very reasonable happy hour prices ($3,4,5) for wine/beer. Sushi was delicious, very fresh and vista on upstairs patio was worth the reasonable wait."}
{"text":"Great food! Fun atmosphere! Pretty view, doesn't feel like you are in Cleveland! Crab cake might be my favorite thing on the menu, fantastic! Oysters are great as well! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Service has a bit to be desired.  Our first waitress was horrible.  After they gave us a new waitress, service definitely improved.  Undecided if I would go back again"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, and I definitely regret it.   Food: I had the lobster roll, it was pretty terrible. None of my friends were particularly impressed with their food either.   Service: It took forever, and they weren't even crowded. I'm pretty sure our waiter just forgot about us. It took them 45 minutes to just take our order, and then another 45 minutes to serve us our food. We all finished our water during this 1.5 hr period, and they never got refilled. When we did eventually get our food, they had messed up some of our orders. We had to get up and find the waiter to get our checks, and then we made her wait, because we didn't want to wait another 45 minutes for her to come back.   Drinks: Their drinks were good, and they have a bar on their roof that is nice and has good views. The service at the bar was good.   Overall, I do not recommend for a meal, but I will give them two stars for their rooftop bar."}
{"text":"Amazing space on the waterfront in the Flats. Went the third day, so service was understandably spotty. They only had 3 of the ten or so oysters on the menu available. I had the strawberry grouper and was not expecting the entire fish, which while tasty, was difficult to eat. I'll need to come back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim with a party of eight for drinks and appetizers early on a Saturday night. We wanted to be upstairs for the view, but we were told they only have four tables upstairs. Oh well we went up anyway. What we didn't expect was all the open space and people standing around holding their food and drinks.  it seems that adding some extra tables upstairs would be wise. Fortunately we only had to wait about 20 minutes before a table opened up. Drinks are served in plastic cups, weird! Service upstairs is non existent. You have to go to the bar and order yourself. My group enjoyed the oyster platter and loaded chips. No complaints, food was delicious. View is great atmosphere fun."}
{"text":"Solid choice for a night out in Cleveland.  I visited in late October, but I can imagine that the scene here would be very cool in warmer weather - right along the river with indoor/outdoor flex options for seating.   During my visit, it was in the 40s outside, so indoor seating for us.  I went with a group from work so it was a slightly different experience as we had a set menu, and I wasn't paying so I can't speak to prices.  Here's what I did experience: --really friendly wait staff, including a nice visit from the manager to check to ensure we had a positive dining experience --extensive drink menu, especially beer and wine, which you would expect from a bar/restaurant, and it did not disappoint!  Great options for all diners --tasty food: many eateries tend to cater towards more general appetite appeal, on many dishes here, they were packing the heat!  Flavorful and spicy.  My coworkers raved about shrimp stuffed peppers.  If you're planning an evening in downtown Cle, especially when the weather is nice, this place is a great option."}
{"text":"Without a doubt,  a first class establishment. Eating oysters & sipping cocktails at the bar with a panoramic waterfront view couldn't of made for a more perfect evening. Plus a Cavs win make everything taste better."}
{"text":"Being from Akron, I found out about this place when I came up to Cleveland on National Oyster Day and decided to dine at The Rusty Anchor for some oysters. I believe Alley Cat had just opened up at the time so it was rather busy and I didn't want to deal with it so skipped it.  Months pass and I decided on a whim to make reservations for a Saturday as a treat for all the OT I've been doing. I had reservations for 2 made via OpenTable. The website lists opening time as 5 but they actually open at 4. I called to confirm around 1 the day before and someone actually picked up to my surprise.  We arrived on time and was quickly seated. I made reservations early to avoid the rush and so that we could explore the new area after dinner. It was restaurant week but we chose to order off the regular menu. I was under the impression that they offered all the oysters on the menu but they rotate them. Kind of disappointing but no biggie. That's a big gamble.  The oysters change so no point in reviewing each one. We ordered 4 of each and they were all good. They were also served in a timely fashion. No issues with our server at all. We also ordered the beef tartar for an app to go along with our oysters.   For the main course, I ordered the monk fish and my friend ordered the grilled octopus. The octopus had me very intrigued but I was informed by my friend that it had mixed reviews. My friend ordered it regardless. The food came out pretty quick I felt and the grilled octopus was AMAZING despite some of the reviews. I went back to read the reviews and they were from when the place first opened so I'm guessing it's all sorted out now. It has a great texture to it. It was fleshy and just something else. Ive only had octopus sashimi style so that's my only comparison as far as texture goes. It's a totally different texture. The Monkfish was, fish. It was good but nothing mind blowing.  Dessert. I normally never do dessert but I just felt like it this time around. I ordered a chocolate cake of some sort that reminded me of tootsie rolls. My friend ordered the raspberry and mango sorbet. The mango sorbet was another mind blowing experience. I've had many things mango flavored but they were pretty much just sweet flavoring with small hints of mango that never really captures the essence of a mango. The best part of eating a REAL mango is the seed. When you shave the meat off of the mango, you really can't get it all off the seed. I enjoy eating the remaining flesh off the seed. Pulling the meat off the seed has a real unique taste/texture to it that was capture very well in that sorbet. Maybe it's just me, but it was very surprising. It's definitely something that knocked me off my feet. Bravo.  Overall the place is nice. I would come back for sure to try some of their other offerings. Check the place out definitely try the grilled octopus."}
{"text":"my mom and i had lunch here on the game 7 world series tuesday, which was abnormally warm! we came right at opening so we had our choice of outside seating by the water. our waitress, can't remember her name (super cute brunette with res lipstick) was super sweet and very helpful.   the only thing i wasn't exactly ecstatic with was our peel and eat shrimp appetizer. it's one of my favorite things to order where it's offered, but this shrimp was HOT (in temperature) and doused in some sort of sauce. since they were obviously just cooked, they were shriveled and small. it was next to impossible to peel and eat them seeing as they were piping hot and dripping in broth. i really wish they had regular dry old bay seasoned shrimp.   for our entrees, my mom had the fish sandwich and loved it. i had the cioppino and it was spectacular! only suggestion is to serve the toasted bread on the side rather than in the dish because a lot of the bread was really soggy.   also: the basil lemonade cocktail!!!! AMAZING!!!   i'm sad i just got around to coming here because i have to probably wait until next year to enjoy the beautiful patio and view."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised that the Alley Cat Oyster Bar's overall rating is only a 3! I thought the food here was amazing and it had a great ambiance! Good to note: I came here on a Sunday night with my dad and sister after spending the day at the Cleveland Art Museum. We only ordered drinks and appetizers, but it was enough to be a full meal.  One quick negative aspect of this restaurant is their inconsistency about their hours. Which are, you know, kind of important. Their website doesn't even list the hours which to me, in this day and age, is annoying. When you Google it says 11:30 am - 8:00 pm on Sundays. Thankfully, I called in advance to ask their Sunday hours and the hostess said they didn't open until 4:00 pm.  Despite this, the food was beyond good!! We ordered the following appetizers to share: Clam Chowder (New England style), Seafood Cocktail (shrimp, scallops, squid, chilled spicy tomato broth), Alley Cat Ceviche (tostones), Shrimp Stuffed Peppers (rock shrimp, Spicy mayo, queso fresco, soy sauce{VERY hot!}), and the Iceberg (tomato, cucumber, avocado, egg, miso ranch and I added fried rock shrimp). All of these dishes went so well together I would even recommend ordering exactly these if you're a hungry party of 3!   The Iceberg Salad and the Seafood Cocktail stand out to me the most. The fried shrimp paired with the cold lettuce and ranch dressing was sooo good! The cocktail was a very liquid-y mixture of all the seafood and vegetables (I was expecting similar to shrimp cocktail) and it was  served in a cocktail glass. You use a spoon to dish it out. These two were by far my favorite, but every single dish was amazing!"}
{"text":"To me this place represents the New Cleveland- buzzling, cool and it makes you think you're in a much larger city. Urban-chic  architecture, great atmosphere and stunning water views. Great selection of food and wine, and the menue is quite innovative. We had seafood quesadillas and a chopped Mexican seafood salad. Both were refreshingly good and tasty.  This place made it to my favorite 5 in this foodie town!"}
{"text":"Go there for the views...but not much else. Located right on the river it offers some great scenery. We were excited to stop in for a bite on a Thursday night. We each had a Lobster Roll it was decent, but at $22/each I was expecting great! The service was very disappointing especially given the crowd was winding down. We saw the water guy more than our waiter. Our waiter Dan took our order and gave us out check. Those were the only times we saw him. Never asked us if we wanted additional drinks or how our food was. But yet I'm still supposed to give him 20% - which I did, but it was undeserved. His lack of attentiveness and mediocre food put a sour spin on the whole experience."}
{"text":"Amazing meal! Loved the oysters, mussels, and snap pea salad. All were delicious and amazing. Service was wonderful as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Saturday brunch was excellent as was the service. Our server, Claudia made a couple suggestions once we briefly explained our likes and dislikes. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I can definitely understand and agree with fellow reviews related to being named an oyster bar and only having 4 oysters options (why I am ratify a 4 & not a 5) but the oysters we tried were fantastic. The broccoli caesar salad was a recommendation from our server and didn't disappoint. My husband had the pork steak and LOVED it, I had the lobster roll and while I wouldn't return specifically to have it again it was good. The location and view definitely help any other issues you might encounter. Overall, if you are expecting a huge oyster selection you may be disappointed but other menu items will make up for it!"}
{"text":"We went here for my friends birthday, and I must say I can completely recommend this place. The bar was great, with a wide selection. The location right on the Cuyahoga River is really cool and dynamic. In the summer, that place will be really nice. The food was amazing. I had the fried whole fish, and I would travel 40 minutes again to have that fish. The oysters were also really fresh, and very tasty. The only reason it is not 5 stars is that the service was a little slow. But definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"We hadn't been down to the East Bank since it's heyday before we were married. It was great to see how it's coming back and Alley Cat is a big reason why. Great views, service, and menu. We stopped in without a reservation on Sweetest Day and they were still very accommodating. We'll have to go back for dinner but on this night we just wanted to check it out and have a drink and appetizer. I had the Blue Point oysters which were on a happy hour special and my wife had the stuffed oysters. We enjoyed it very much, even the parking is easy now with reasonable valet for $10. Flats are back but more upscale."}
{"text":"One star because they have a massive lot next to their restaurant saying valet only on a monday night yet after $15 between valet and tip, you find your car missing at 1110 pm luckily see anemployee leaving the restaurant who gives my party of 5 vague directions where to find our car a mile away.  I couldnt ask the \"manager\" of asv parking to pls advise patrons next time valet ends at ?? 10? 1030? 11?  Because he became militant about how he was right and its fine i should expect to have a wild goose chase for my 70000 car and 1000 client dinner. This is one of many reasons why downtown is dead on weeknights and why I will have to find other places for client dinners. Disappointint"}
{"text":"A terrible experience. I've been to Zack Bruell's other restaurant L'albatros many times and considering the high quality of service there I was extremely disappointed with Alley Cat. We had reservations over two weeks in advance for a birthday for a party of 6 people. We got there early and went up to the roof to grab a drink. We were ignored for 5 minutes and so we decided to go back downstairs. The hostess seated us in corner table next to a part of 9 that was seated/standing around a 6 top and they were obviously overserved. We politely asked our server if she could please ask them to keep it down since they were in the dining section at a 6 top rather than the bar. She said she couldn't do anything about it. We decided to ride it out. The waitress took our order for 1 beer and a bottle of wine split 4 ways. A different waitress returned 30 minutes later with our drinks. We ordered 6 appetizers, two of which were the wrong items. For entrees, the fried perch sandwiches tasted like frozen microwave filet. The fried chicken was soggy and tasted like the spices hadn't been cooked. Two of the runners spilled food, one on the table and another on one of our guests. Lastly, there was a leak in the ceiling that kept dripping on me. If you are going to support Zack Bruell, go to L'albatros. The Alley Cat Oyster bar gives Cleveland a bad name. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME THERE."}
{"text":"Great oysters, Nice ambience, friendly staff. Really cool location and glad to see the revitalization of the flats."}
{"text":"To begin, my fiance and I ordered 3 of each of the 4 types of oysters. His favorite were the Blue Point, the largest; my favorite were the the Saluation Coves, with a buttery finish. We both enjoyed them with dirty martinis.  Next, we ordered the charred broccoli salad, which was excellent. It was a new, creative dish that I have never seen anywhere else. However, if you are looking for a light salad this is not it. The broccoli was covered in the Caesar dressing, very creamy. I don't usually like my food charred, however the charred flavor combined with the dressing worked well. The two elements really balanced one another. Also, this dish made me appreciate eating entire pieces of broccoli, stems included.   We also split the lobster roll. My fiance enjoyed it more than me. The lobster didn't seem very fresh and I thought the bread was greasy.   And lastly, the female bathroom was located in such a terrible spot. It was right next to the patio door and a server station. Just waiting for the bathroom was awkward and I had to constantly switch poistions to stay out of both servers' and patrons' way."}
{"text":"Went to Alley Cats for lunch yesterday.  The food is aout of this wold good!!! Not sure how come I have not been here sooner, but now that I have I will be a loyal customer.  The baked oysters were great, but I prefer the stuffed oysters much better.  We devoured two orders :)  The main event was the lobster roll.  The best I have had in Cleveland hands down.  Not minced meat, or langoustine, but real freaking lobster chunks.  Please go and enjoy.  Zack Bruell never misses with any of his resturants.  GO,GO,GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a great combination of excellent service (the manager not only checks in every one but takes care of every small thing!), great food, and very reasonable pricing. The only place in the flats with a direct view of the water that is chic and tasty."}
{"text":"The bar has been raised with this casual seafood dining restaurant in the heart of the east bank coast. This three tiered location provides breathtaking views from all angels and should it be missed. Whether you are here for, lunch, brunch, or dinner, you will leave pleased with the meal you have received.  I highly recommend the outdoor seating for the cool breeze and waterfront views. The mixed drinks are concocted just right, and will leave you wanting more. The margarita was excellent: strong, yet reasonable.  As for food, the oyster appetizer was succulent with nothing left to consume. The seafood cioponni was absolutely delicious filled with mussels, shrimp, clams and scallops, which were broiled to perfect.   I highly recommend dining here anytime of the week, you will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"If you a bored suburban housewife looking for her husband to pay for all his sins, this is your pick for a date night in Cleveland. It is an upscale TGI Fridays on the river with mediocre food. Service is descent if you want them to agree with everything you say. Plates are large and lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"Been here many times and have never been disappointed! The managers Tommy and Mike always go over beyond to make sure you have the best experience.  In addition to the amazing view, incredible servers and bartenders (love Iris)...the food is some of the best seafood around!  I've been waiting for a place like this to open in Cleveland for years!!"}
{"text":"Two couples ate there last night. The location on the river is, as many people reviewed, exceptional, water activity, bridges, walkers etc. We had a 6.30 reservation and sat relatively quickly even though they were busy. The bread and water arrived shortly. The waiter arrived about a half hour later, we ordered shrimp cocktail, pickled vegetables, bisque and a salad. All were enjoyed. For entrees octopus, halibut, red snapper and the seafood salad. As many reviews mentioned, it was over cooked, difficult to cut with a knife and fork. Some reviews gave it high marks. My advice it is inconsistent. All other entrees were enjoyed. The desserts were rich. The service was slow, either the kitchen is not prepared for the crowd or they need more wait staff."}
{"text":"We went in the fall for a Sunday brunch and oh my goodness, what a deal. $40 for all you can eat brunch with a bloody Mary or mimosa!! Epic. They kept the oysters refilled as he kept going back for more! I loved everything I tried but definitely I loved that they included so many seafood options as that's the reason we frequent alley cat. It's hard to go back for dinner when brunch is such an amazing deal. As always service was epic. Drinks were perfect and delightful. View is always nice. I prefer to go when it's a bit warmer and sit by the window but in Cleveland you cannot control or predict the weather.  But the silver lining of the cold, Probably the best clam chowder in Cleveland!! I truly always have the best experience here."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best crab cake I've ever had! They have good bourbon choices including Basil Hayden. Great views! If today hadn't been rainy we would have been on the upstairs deck.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Slow and all I ordered was a dozen oysters..... it took 20 mins lol..... I could of bought them and shucked them myself and ate them and paid half price lol oysters were great but for that price I expect to wait no longer than 5 mins.... horseradish was kind of bland"}
{"text":"Alley Cat would get more stars from me if the staff was a bit more friendly. I'm referring to the rude hostesses up front who acted like we were a pain for showing up a few minutes EARLY to our reservation. So that was not a good start to the evening. Our waitress was extremely friendly and the service from there on out was very good. The shrimp stuffed peppers were extremely delicious(very spicy!) and the lobster roll was very good. The ambience was great- especially being right on the water and our reservation was perfect as we all got to enjoy a beautiful sunset over the river. Overall, I would come back but this won't be a regular stop in Cleveland and out of all of Zach's restaurants, this one isn't the best. Just a tip to management, the staff up front are the first impression of your business. The young ladies seating people and taking reservations should be a bit more patient and friendly with patrons- especially given how much money they are spending."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I was quite excited to try out the Alley Cat Oyster Bar. The place looks absolutely AMAZING. The view of the river is just so relaxing...if that can even make sense in a place like Cleveland, but ANYWAYS..(BTW MAPS DIRECTIONS TO THIS PLACE Are A NIGHTMARE. Just go all the way down W.9th and make a left at the last street. Take it straight down)  I came alone..so i sat at the bar. The bartender was GREAT.. I was exasperated from struggling to find the place so I just told him to make me something strong. He came up with a cosmo which tasted AMAZING. I'm quite the lover of spirits and I can say that it didn't taste like a cup of alcohol, but the buzz mirrored that of a drink that would.   I started off with the wedge salad. It looked great..and WOULD have tasted great if they hadn't given me a.....ugh..I can't even find the words..the \"bad\" part of the lettuce head. I don't know if lettuce ripens..but it just tasted like it wasn't \"ripe\". Forgive me for not knowing the right thing to say. It was hard and and had that weird taste to it...That was the ONLY thing wrong. I simply ate it because I was STARVING and it wasn't SO BAD with all of the fixings that wedge salads come with.  My entree was a big ticket item..then $60 Maine Lobster.   My god..it was terrible. I felt like I was chewing on it for days. I'm not a complainer..I'm the type of person who just goes with the flow and chalks everything up as \"You chose this..now this is the consequence\".  It was like they had cooked the lobster again..and again..and again. I've never had lobster that tough...ANYWHERE. I heard one of the cooks say that it was the \"last\" lobster which kind of made me wonder if they were cooking out the spoil.  THATS HOW TOUGH IT WAS.   The manager came and asked me how everything was..and I said it was bad. He offered me a free drink. Maybe if I would have been an angry customer he would have comped my meal, but HEY..like I said..I'm not a complainer unless the food is 100% inedible.   I struggled to finish half of the lobster before deciding to just be done with it.   Would I go to alleycat Oyster bar again? YES  I would only go for DRINKS and WINGS. I would never buy anything over $15 at that establishment...EVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Terrible! This was or 2nd visit. Took our out of state family because we enjoyed the 1st visit. Two people ordered fish sandwich which was supposed to be white fish. The fish had gray and black coloring and smelled fishy. Our server agreed it didn't smell right. The manager came out and said   It smelled normal but said she'd take it off the bill. When we got our bill, she took fish off bill but still charged $5 for fries that were served with the sandwich. We never complain about food, but when there were 2 meals not being eaten it was necessary. The handling of the situation was very bad and we will not be back for that reason!"}
{"text":"The oysters were great and the lobster roll was delicious. They have a great selection of beer and drinks to make your meal complete. Only didn't give 5 stars because the server didn't seem very knowledgeable on the menu."}
{"text":"It was just OK. I had the seafood quesadilla. The service seems very confused at what they are doing. It was hard to tell if a waiter/waitress was bringing food, drinks, menus. I would give it time before it becomes a better place. It doesn't help that out of 8 people dining, 6 walked away with upset stomachs/ poop."}
{"text":"When the concierge tells you to take a cab, you should. Alley Cats isn't located in a sketchy area of town but it is super confusing to find. We wandered the 15 min walk for 40 min before we called uber. Consider yourselves warned.   Now about the restaurant: Great vibe. Right on the water with way cool garage doors that open so you can see the massive boats going past.   Waitstaff is fast and unobtrusive. Bread with fresh olive oil, along with cold water (no ice) arrives soon after you're seated. We asked for recommendations and our server walked through both the most popular items and his personal favorites. The prices ranged in his recommendations so we didn't feel like he was pushing particular plates.   We opted for a small cup of clam chowder, with a plate of stuffed oysters (6), Mexican ceviche and a couple of the specialty raw oysters (sold individually). It was plenty of food and was all delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We got bluepoint oysters, oyster shots, popcorn shrimp, beef tartare and our entrees. I loved the blue point oysters and oyster shots. Popcorn shrimp I can do without. Beef tartare was good with a raw egg on top.   For my entire, I got the grouper cheeks which was pretty darn delicious. I'm not sure why this place has lower stars but the food is good, the views are also great. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool.  Our bar tender was great. I ended up getting a Sunrise with tequila and a lobster roll, which was tasty.  My boyfriend got scotch on the rocks and oysters.   The bar tender was able to vibe with us about different oysters from different regions.  This place is casual but divey. It's right off of the water, which makes it kind of romantic.  I would go back."}
{"text":"I love the modern interior of this place and the awesome views of the water! It's great that they have happy hour on Saturday (3-6) in the bar area -- you can get a good deal and have a great view!   The service here was really attentive! The wine on the happy hour menu were actual nice wines and not just the bottom shelf grocery store wine. The cocktail list looked really awesome and I can't wait to try it next time!  I think we had oysters every way possible! We had several styles of raw oysters -- it's so cool that they have oysters from all over the country. We also had stuffed oysters and baked oysters. We weren't messing around!! They were all so delicious, but the raw ones are definitely the way to go!  The clam chowder was one of the best I've ever tasted!   Definitely recommend stopping in and trying the different raw oysters!"}
{"text":"You know how when you're on vacation somewhere in Florida and you're not really sure where to go or where the hot spots are, so you end up going to a popular area because that's what tourists do and you're walking along and you go \"well this place is in business in a popular area, it has to be at least above average to stay in business\" then you sit down and look over everything and get acquainted with the surroundings.  You're like \"wow this is really nice, I can't believe it's right on the water\" and \"wow is so packed\" and \"geez the prices are a little high, but it's a touristy area so that makes sense.  Well guess what folks! You don't have to go to Florida to fall in a tourist trap when you have Alley Cat Oyster Bar right in your backyard.  Let's start with the good.  The Flats East Bank is probably better (or more populated) than the developers could have imagined at this point.  Sitting like the angel atop the Christmas tree is the Alley Cat Oyster Bar in all its glory.  A large, imposing structure on the Cuyahoga beckoning you  like a seafood lighthouse.  It looks like everything you could ever want in a building...home, office, restaurant, whatever.  The staff all dresses in the same shirts.  Okay, we got the good out of the day way.  Now let's talk about how this Great Pyramid encapsulates a bad to mediocre seafood restaurant.  Disclaimer:  I've been here for 2 dinners, a happy hour, and a late night oyster run.  This is not a first impression.  Let's start with the worst, which is apparently the oyster supplier.  Zack Bruell should sit down with whoever this is and get on the same page.  Maybe he woke up one day with this vision and developed it, then on the last day goes \"oh shit I need an oyster guy, it's in the name.\"  Our Capital oyster were delivered on ice cubes bigger than the half shells.  Have you seen the videos on the Internet of people making tiny Krispy Kreme donuts in tiny pots of oil on tiny stoves?  Look it up, then put my oysters next to it.  This, after a conversation with the bartender about briney vs size, and his recommendation to SIZE and his preference. It's likely that he publishes those tiny cooking videos to the Internet.  Didn't ask.  So we go back to our first preference, the PEI oysters which were still smaller than the Prince Edward Island shells I expect, and the goodness inside was 1/3 of what you can get for the same price at any decent steak or seafood joint in Cleveland.  So who is ZB getting his oysters from? Sam's Club.  Maybe he and I should go on a oyster tour of Cleveland, and go to all the places that don't have the word in their name, then we can go to all of the places that do have it, and we'll compare.  Hint: the former wins.  At the same price.  In addition, somehow, possibly because it's in the Flats, this place also manages to lose the service, attentiveness, and friendliness that makes Chinato, L'Albatros, etc so inviting.  So you've gone and paired the most impressive location and building, with the least accommodating staff, least appealing menu, and a mockery of an oyster bar into a bar with oyster in the name.  Like I said, Zack Bruell is bringing the tourist trap to you!"}
{"text":"excellent dining. food was marvelous. only issue was the lighting. I would at least like to see what my food looks like. atmosphere.....perfect...."}
{"text":"Went here with my friend after being all excited about the new Flats. It's not all that, let me tell you. Unless you exclusively eat seafood do NOT go to Alley Cat. We had waited at the bar for 30 minutes for a table so when we were finally seated we weren't about to go somewhere else, so we made do. I got the burger. One of the few non-seafood dishes on the menu. But what was smeared on it? Shrimp spread! I ordered my burger rare and instead it was raw. Cold. Not bloody red. Cold and red. Raw ground meat red. No blood ran from it when I bit into it. Because blood doesn't run out of raw ground beef. Sure, I ate it. That kind of stuff doesn't scare me. But seriously. I expected better. My friend got the world's most expensive grilled cheese, the other non-seafood item. But what was on it? Yup. You guessed it. Shrimp spread. The same that was on my burger. Way to be creative. You couldn't think of a different spread? So basically any non-seafood item is really served with seafood. My burger had some slaw on it that was the exact same slaw that was served as a side to my friend's grilled cheese. I think clearly Bruell ran out of ideas for food. Seriously. The bread before we got our meals was good, but again, it was just bread. The olive oil we dipped it in was stellar, I will grant that. The happy hour peach sangria was weak and made in advance. Lame. Not worth the price. The service was mediocre. I've had better but I've also had worse. Nothing memorable one way or the other. Obviously, prices are high here because of the location. (Read: The food is not worth the price. You are paying for the view not the food. And there are several places in the Flats with the same view!) I wouldn't have paid a fraction of those prices for the same food and drinks elsewhere. And I will never pay those prices again at Alley Cat. Not when there are better places to go. Hipper places. All with a view. But better food."}
{"text":"Went in September, was able to get a reservation. We requested outside, and they said they couldn't guarantee it, but would try. We ended up getting a perfect table on the patio with great views of the boardwalk and river. Not an oyster fan, so I ended up getting the trout, which was fantastic."}
{"text":"Returned to this place after almost a year.....still problem with the service is that it is too slow. They forgot to give us forks...so when our main dishes came out, how were we supposed to eat? I physically got up and got utensils for the table. You are paying a premium for location, not the food. The food was mediocre, spend your money at other Bruell restaurants, that frankly, are just better. The restaurant has the river right next to it that is going for it. That's about it."}
{"text":"Good food, disappointing service.   Came here on a Friday night for my birthday dinner. Made reservations for 6:30pm, the restaurant was a little more than half full at the time however it quickly filled up. The decor is very open and industrial chic decorated in shades of grey's. However the open concept makes for a loud dining experience.   We were promptly seated at our reservation time however it took a full 10 minutes before our waiter stopped by and greeted us. Which is how the rest of the meal service went unfortunately.   We ordered a dozen mixed oysters - note they only serve 3 varieties at a time, which is disappointing. The oysters were poorly cleaned, gritty and sandy - not a good combo at $2.75 each. This is very disappointing especially since they tote the fact that they are an oyster bar.   Our entrees were much better than our mediocre oysters. We ordered the salmon with curry sauce, walleye with sweet potato purée and brussels sprouts, and the scallops with wild mushroom risotto. All of the fish was fresh and well prepared and most importantly tasty. We finished our meals with the salted caramel chocolate cake and the rice custard creme brûlée. Both were a delicious.   However the issue I had other than the oysters was the service. There was many a times our water glasses sat empty or our drink glasses were never offered to be refilled. We hardly saw our waiter, in the 2 hours we were there we maybe saw him 4 times. That's not to say they didn't have more than enough busers to clear tables or refill other sections waters, however our table was regularly left out.  We also had to flag our waiter down for our check, since after 2 hours we wanted to finally leave since we had been done with our desserts for 20 minutes and we couldn't have lingered over drinks since our glasses were empty.   May try the happy hour when the weather is nice since the view is great and the menu seems more reasonably priced.    Tip-splurge for valet, it's worth it when it's cold and windy and is only $10 on weekends."}
{"text":"For having oyster in the name of the restaurant I was expecting a bigger to do to be made about oysters. The oyster options are at the bottom of the menu and there were only four varieties available. This was disappointing. I was hoping for a much larger selection. The waiter also provided no information about them. They were enjoyable though. I tried one of each. They were served both with the traditional cocktail sauce and horseradish and a house made mignonette. This was a nice touch as most places leave off the traditional fixings when they make their own mignonette, which per usual I was not a big fan of.   Oysters aside, for an entree I tried the bass. The waiter, when asked to provide food suggestions, strongly pushed the fresh fish options as he said they are ever changing, while a lot of the more popular dishes like the Lobster Roll are on the menu to stay and are even on the lunch menu.   My bass was good. The flavor combination was great and the fish was well cooked. The tuna my friend ordered was tasty as well.   Service left nothing special to report. That coupled with just good food and no emphasis on oysters led to my 3 star rating. The only 5 star thing about this place is the patio view, though that is shared by several East Bank restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for two different events and each time I am reminded of how great the location is. This is a great spot to meet up with friends for happy hour or spending a Friday night. The bar is located right in the flats and has huge windows that looks out at the river.   I also believe they have a rooftop where you can sit. However, I have not been up there yet. Hopefully next time I can."}
{"text":"Loved the food and the view! My friend's seafood quesadilla looked amazing and was piping hot; my lobster roll was so good, but kind of small for $22.   I wish our waitress was better or more knowledgable... But she was sweet. Great views, great place to celebrate or walk around."}
{"text":"Amazing west coast oyster and calm chowder just as amazing! Oysters are a must-try."}
{"text":"Don't worry alley cat, you are not the only ones missing the whole point of going out which is hospitality. Server was nice but forgot few things.  after pending $100 bucks for lunch can I get a thank you, smile and eye contact from the 3 people I passed? One of which was the host who's Job is to greet and bid a fine farewell? Great chowder and pea salad."}
{"text":"Starting with the food.  Alley Cat Ceviche - very good with tomatoes, avocados and plantains chips. Seafood bisque another winner. Not too thick with a bit of spice kick. Several in my party ordered the seafood quesadilla and loved it. My Fish sandwich, was lightly breaded and not greasy. I forgot to have them hold the house grain mustard (dijon) so my first bite left a bitter taste.  Had to ask for a new bun - which my sandwich became cold by the time they replaced it.  This was served with way too many fries. it was about 3cups worth. Not necessary, I would probably ask to substitute if I were to order it again. I though that the fresh fish was priced way to high. Nothing was below $30.  Flats: expect to pay $10 for valet, $7.50 to self-park. I am glad to see this area is getting a make over, but for me it will not be a weekly spot with the pricing."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends (4 total) for dinner on a Tuesday night. Restaurant is very trendy and I'd even say hipsterish. The decor is beautiful and being able to look out onto the water is a great addition to dinner. It was packed even on a Tuesday night with no events going on downtown. We were seated at a table by the bar. There is a nice bar with big screen TVs that were showing a tennis match.   They bring out bread and olive oil to start. The olive oil was of course Zack Bruell's own. It was good but the bread was crusty to the point where you'd cut your gums on it. The next time they brought out bread it was nice and soft inside but crusty outside.   While we had several visits to bring bread or refill our water we did not see our server until at least 30 min. after we arrived. She apologized and took our drink and food order promptly. The food took quite a while to arrive.  We of course ordered the oysters as a starter. The menu online shows a dozen varieties but the actual menu had half a dozen varieties. Then the server explained they only had 3 varieties. Pretty slim pickings for an \"oyster bar\". It took quite a while for the oysters and food to arrive. The oysters were great although pricey at around $3 each. Served with the traditional accompaniments. I ordered the perch sandwich because of the rave reviews. It came with a mountain of fries. The fries were great but the sandwich not so much, I was only able to eat about half of it because the fish was extremely greasy leading me to believe it was not fried at the proper temperature. My friend's lobster roll looked much better and he said it was quite good.   I can't fully recommend this place but I'm willing to give them another try. I hope that they do better next time."}
{"text":"Surprisingly not impressed. We came here on a whim and I'm actually disappointed we did.  I chose a burger and salad because I wasn't that hungry. The bun was soggy, the meat was undercooked, and the tater tots were so greasy when you squeezed them grease dripped out. My boyfriend chose the lobster roll and he enjoyed it but definitely has had better. The drinks were the best part. Our server wasn't that great, actually the lady who brought the bread, water, and took our dishes was outstanding. We actually tipped based on her and I wish we could have just handed her the tip. I'm sure we will be back on a warm summer day but for the winter it just wasn't the outstanding experience you'd expect when paying $130+ for a meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic new spot! The food is fresh and wonderful! The meals were unique and prepared with a lot of care. We started with oysters and two of the salads that were wonderful. The grilled Broccoli Cesar was unexpectedly amazing! We had the seafood salad, tuna entree, fish sandwich and the grilled octopus. We were too full for desert. Service was impeccable and the views made us feel like we were on vacation. We can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner tonight at Alley Cat.  Beautiful location right on the river along the new boardwalk.  It was just okay, maybe 3 1/2 stars.  First it's loud, but I guess that's the new trend in restaurants.  It was a hot muggy summer night and the overhead doors were open, the temperature inside was fine, but it was still loud.  Then across the river at Shooters they had some awful band and all you could here was some guy yodeling - I know that's not Alley Cat's fault and it was actually pretty funny, but still added to the already loud atmosphere.  They have only been open a few weeks, but the service was pretty good.  Now the drinks, I ordered a margarita and my son's girlfriend ordered the blackberry margarita, both drinks were from their drink menu.  Now I've had many margaritas, some good, some not so good.  When I make a margarita at home I use tequila, lime juice, Grand Mariner and maybe some Cointreau, tasty.  Alley Cat's margarita tasted like bottled lime juice, period.  I could not taste any tequila, maybe it was vodka, there was not one tiny bit of sweetness in this drink, nothing not even crappy old Triple Sec.  Just bottled lime juice.  The blackberry margarita tasted like bottled lime juice with a few blackberries crushed with it. Very weird tasting, I switched to wine.  They have a long list of oysters, but only 3 are available at a time.  We sampled all 3 types and they were extremely good.  My husband loved his perch sandwich, and my son and his girlfriend had the Chili Braised Beef, which they both loved.  I had the Grilled Octopus and it was good-ish.    The grilled octopus was nicely grilled, but there was something slimy, like maybe the skin, it took away from my enjoyment of this dish. I've only had raw octopus before so maybe this was the way it was suppose to be.  Then there is parking, nice new parking lot down there, but only for valet and the valet is $10 which I think is a bit high.  I have always worked downtown so I am used to paying to park, but when you build a new development with a new parking lot but don't allow your patrons to park there seems out of line.  Now I can see when the East Bank is done and the place will be hopping every night, I will gladly pay $10 for a valet so I don't have to search or walk a long distance to park, but right now it's still pretty empty down there so stop gouging people.  You want to attract people not put them off.  I may go again sometime for a beer and oysters, but for a pricey sit down dinner, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and view of the water. Calamari appetizer was nice. Unfortunately, the group I was with ordered the broccoli salad as a side which was charred to a crisp. I ordered the cod fish sandwich from the menu and was served perch.  The worst part, however, was that the sandwich was served with literally a pile of cilantro - root to leaf - and a giant knob of ginger was in the middle of the sandwich. Sadly it appears it was the cook's first day on the job. A pity because the location is great and the servers were fantastic."}
{"text":"I normally hesitate to try new restaurants but I feel a bit more comfortable if it is a Zack Bruell creation. Alley Cat is the next big thing. No question. I wasn't sure what to expect as the area is still a bit of a construction zone. But next summer, this will be the place to be. To keep it short, amazing location, amazing views, amazing food and drinks, and great service. And this is their first week!  I only expect great things for Alley Cat and the whole FEB development. Fantastic job!"}
{"text":"I am currently sitting at the bar - maybe I would give a better rating if someone would serve us. Yes it's a Wednesday, and busy, but nothing overwhelming. It's been probably 14 minutes without service - although the bartender has told us \"just a minute\" at least three times. But two drunk middle aged men next to us received their shots of fireball within 3 minutes of being seated. Odd. Atmosphere is great, love the open garage door. Service is below par obviously. Guy who sat us was super nice. Bartender aren't very easy on the eyes either."}
{"text":"Flawless oyster presentation, perfectly cooked cod, good service, fun cocktails. Get a table by the water, or on the patio. Cat's Pajamas is delicious, and strong. Not bad for well behaved kids who like seafood.   East Bank flats is back!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just awful.  Slow service. The shrimp was BAD.  I picked all of mine out of the Mexican seafood salad. My husband ate one bite of his shrimp po'boy and felt too ill to continue.  They compensated him for his meal.  No apology. The music was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to get down to the newly redeveloped Flats area. With Restaurant Week happening this week, we decided to check out Alley Cats.   We both ordered off the RW menu. I got the beet salad, walnut crusted chicken and chocolate terrine. My husband ordered shrimp appetizer, beer battered catfish and coconut cheesecake.   My beet salad was very good and the house vinaigrette dressing made it. The chicken was moist and tender but had a little too much walnut coating. The mashed cauliflower was excellent. The chocolate terrine was extremely rich. My husband said his was very good from the shrimp to the cheesecake.  Our server Ricky was very friendly and attentive. We enjoyed him.  The views are exceptional and since it was a balmy November evening, the garage doors were open which made it that much nicer. This place definitely makes one feel that The Flats are back and will thrive. Such a fun vibe in the area."}
{"text":"Loved our bar tender. Host stand could use a personality check! Please don't patronize me! Your restaurant was full of unfilled tables yet you say you are seating by reservation only?!! The tables are still empty and we have been at the bar for over an hour. Great location. Overpriced food. You decide. For the money i would rather go to Blue Point up the street. They were closed today."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Staff is not even close to familiar with their menu. To top it all off got our order and bill wrong! It took a substantial amount of time to get our drinks and food to come. Not an enjoyable time, had to eat alone while everyone else was eating filled my self on bread because of it. I will say the bus woman ( I don't know the correct name for the position) was great, always came cleared the table and filled water timely. Everything else from the food to the service was by far the worst."}
{"text":"My server was the best waiter I've ever had... Anywhere in the country.  The clam chowder is very tasty. I also had the raw oysters... Happy hour special for the win. Sooo good.   The main course - their amazing lobster roll. Warm, buttery, and delicious. Comes with old bay fries.  Great food, great view on the water."}
{"text":"We stopped in for happy hour on Sunday after our visit to the West Side Market. We loved The Alley Cat!! It is so nice to see The Flats making a comeback!!  We were greeted very pleasantly at the door by the hostess, Chelsea. She informed us that happy hour was served at the bar so we chose to sit at the bar. The view was perfect from our seats!! The bartender John was very friendly and extremely helpful with the menu and the drink selections. He recommended the Latin Loaded Fries. What a great combination of toppings on the fries and the beef on top reminded me of my mother's home made roast beef. We also got the Seafood Quesadilla. That was superb also, loaded with seafood and the toppings were so tasty. I can't wait to go back this summer and enjoy the fine food at The Alley Cat Oyster Bar."}
{"text":"Whether you are coming here for lunch or dinner, the atmosphere is great! I've say inside before and on the rooftop patio as well. Outside rooftop patio has a more simple 'bar' food menu. Inside is a little more fancy. I like both. The calamari was excellent (dinner) and the fish tacos were great too (lunch). Not a big oyster fan in general but I hear they are very good here. 4 stars because the prices are very high."}
{"text":"Location is amazing! However, we were disappointed for 2 reasons.  One... I made reservations several days in advance and requested outdoor seating, but when we got there they put us inside. Two... the food was not good! Oysters were pathetically small, shrimp linguine lacked flavor, and burger was dripping grease like we have never seen before.  We would go back for the atmosphere ... but only for drinks."}
{"text":"Just finished my meal here. Worst food. Service sucks. Waited 15 minutes and had to remind Cassy the bartender what we ordered twice. The hostess were very rude and unapproachable. I guess you don't have to be nice to people if your busy. We watched tables go that were empty for 2 hours and were told they had reservations for them. We ended up sitting upstairs with a great view and lousy food. Setting is very pretty, that is all they have going them. We have tacos and Mexican salad. No flavor. Will not be back. To many other places to eat in Cleveland!!!!"}
