{"text":"Tried the ube and custard flavored waffles and they were delightful snacks. Hot fresh out the oven and staff are extremely sweet. Note: Halo Halo is only served in the summer time"}
{"text":"Good flavours but it was too much bread/dough  compared to the fillings.  Needs better proportion; more filling.  Make sure you have a drink handy because it's a heavy meal."}
{"text":"The price here is extremely reasonable. I expected the waffles to be a lot smaller given that they were 3 for $5.   Having just come from lunch, we ordered 3 sweet ones to share (custard, caramel and strawberry). They were fine. Too sweet though imo. Maybe they should use less  filling? Also note that the \"strawberry\" filling is actually strawberry jam.   With so  many egg waffle options in the immediate vicinity, I'm not sure if I'll go back. If I did return, I'd try the savory options."}
{"text":"Waffles are ubiquitous at Pacific Mall. From egg puff waffles to Wanda's Belgium Waffles, these desserts are an essential feature at the mall. Therefore, I was stoked to discover Pinoy Waffles.  Established as a waffle vendor with a Filipino twist, this stall distinguishes itself well  amongst its competitors.  You will find the stall hidden away on the second floor in the food court area. Currently, it's in front of Legend Tea and it's nearby Papa Chang Express.   The prices are excellent at $2 per waffle or at 3 waffles for $5.  Even within the cheap eats landscape of Pacific Mall, they are on the more affordable end. Plus, I love how you can request any of the flavours when you order 3 waffles for $5!  They take debit along with cash, so go ham you plastic lovers!  There is a rainbow of different fillings you can order.  For example, they have ube, cream cheese, strawberry, apple cinnamon, custard, hot dog, ham and cheese, and so forth. I find the variety highly appealing because it creates an opportunity for you to come back if you weren't satisfied with the fillings you initially ordered. Last weekend, for instance, I got three waffles: one with ube, one with cream cheese, and one with ham and cheese.  All three were unfortunately underwhelming. The waffle exterior was warm, slightly sweet, and great texture-wise.  However, the ube and cream cheese fillings were bland, and the ham and cheese were too salty.  Nonetheless, because there are so many flavours, I will definitely be coming back to try something else. Perhaps I will like the fruit or caramel flavours more. In essence, if you visit and don't enjoy your items, I encourage you to avoid writing this stall off and instead to try other flavours in the hopes of finding a more appetizing filling. I mean, the waffles are so budget-friendly that a second round won't dent your wallet one bit!"}
{"text":"After seeing a couple of foodies on Instagram talking about this place, I decided to try it out. Pinoy Waffles recently just opened on the 2nd level of Pacific Mall, their store is just slightly after crossing the bridge.  When I arrived, the lady who was really friendly and nice told me that I would have to wait since I wanted to try the Hot Dog flavour and she was currently making the hot dogs and told me to come back later.  Other flavours offered were: ham & cheese, cheddar cheese, cream cheese, chocolate, caramel, custard, strawberry, blueberry, apple cinnamon, purple yam or ube and lemon. They also sold coffee (regular or vanilla/hazelnut) and other cold drinks.  You can grab 1 waffle for $2, or 3 for $5. I was already pretty full from earlier so I grabbed only the hot dog waffle. She made the waffle fresh for me after I came back and ordered it again.  The waffle took about 7-10 minutes to make and came in a brown paper bag. The waffle was bigger than I thought. Well, technically it'd be the size of a regular hot dog wiener, but it was slightly bigger than that.  The waffle was hard and crispy, with the soft chewy hot dog inside. I wasn't a fan of it because the waffle was harder that I thought, I thought it would have a softer texture. I think I just don't like the combo of the waffle and hot dog together because it didn't seem to balance out. It was also very simple and nothing much stood out, since it was just a basic hot dog per se. But it was just $2 and I can't complain much.  I'm not sure if I'll be back since there are so many other snack places that I enjoy around PMall that I would rather go to than here."}
{"text":"3 for $5 -slightly sweet waffle served with hotdog inside. Crispy outside waffle. Located inside Pacific Mall. Get some! Super friendly staff! Other flavors available too."}
{"text":"Ever since this place opened in Pacific Mall food court, I have not been going to anywhere else but Pinoy Waffles!  This is a small stand with a simple menu of unique style waffles - Pinoy style - with different flavors to choose from!   They are cheap and very flavorful. My 2 favorite flavors are: Hotdog. And the other one is their Ube waffle.  I believe it costs $2 for one and 3 pieces for $5.   If they do not have the waffle flavor on display, they would make one fresh for you with only a 2-3 minute wait.  Service is fast and friendly and food is really fresh. I recommend this place as it is a unique concept, definitely something different out of the typical food choices in Pacific mall (e.g. noodles, rice, beef balls). Try this place if you want something different.  Review 40 of 100"}
{"text":"Simple flavours like ham and cheese, chocolate, custard and purple yam. These waffles are shaped in logs and it's sad they cut away the crispy bits-what a waste!  $2 a piece is not bad for a snack. However, the waffle was way to doughy for me; I felt like I was eating a cake or a sweet doughnut because it's so dense. Crispy on the outside and made fresh to order. The fillings aren't abundant but how can you complain for $2.  What I like is their system, they have cute little bags with stamped flavourings on the bag so you know which waffle you're eating if you're getting a bunch of them."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe I haven't tried Pinoy Waffles sooner. I guess I couldn't easily find the location on previous visits. For reference it's in the same row as the carpeted bridge leading to the food stalls on the second floor of Pacific Mall.  This small food stall specializes in a dozen different flavours of elongated waffles with various fillings. When I went I had debated between getting the ham and cheese or ube (purple yam) flavours. At $2 each or 3/$5, I decided on two ube waffles and one ham and cheese waffle.   The smell of the sweet waffle batter is intoxicating. They make the waffles upon ordering. Both flavours were tasty but I definitely recommend trying the ube. The shop owner mentioned that she makes her own ube from scratch (no dark purple bottled ube used here). It was not too sweet and the soft chewy waffle is such a delicious vessel for the ube.   The customer before me said that she bought $40 worth of Pinoy Waffles for her family to try. That's a lot of waffles! Apparently they also sell empanadas on weekends. Pleased to see some Filipino representation among the food options at Pacific Mall.   3.5 stars.  (7/100) (2017)"}
{"text":"Glad to have more Filipino presence at Pacific Mall! Pinoy Waffles offers a variety of fillings - from blueberry, cream cheese, caramel, and custard to hot dog, chocolate, and lemon, etc. Located near the entrance/bridge to the upstairs food court, you can buy the waffles at $2 each or 3/$5.00. They also have halo-halo (a Filipino shaved ice dessert) for $5.00.   My fam and I got three of them: ham & cheese, custard, and ube (pronounced ooh-beh, purple yam). All of them were really hot once we bit into them so take caution before taking your first (big) bite! The custard one was the sweetest of the three, the ham & cheese the most savoury, and the ube a good mix of sweet & savoury but mostly sweet. The waffles are a decent size - thicker and bigger than your standard hot dog. The waffle exterior is also a bit harder than you might expect - closer to a crispy waffle than a soft one.  There will be a wait time before getting them since it's a small take-out space, one kind lady operating everything, & only a couple of waffle making machines. It's a nice change from all the other yummy things PMall offers so I recommend trying it out before crossing it off as a choice. The taste is sort of what you expect from what it sounds like - waffle sticks with filling. Overall, it's a good snack!"}
{"text":"Came here after seeing some check-ins of food bloggers on IG. We got 3 flavours to try since it's  $5 for 3. We got strawberry, hotdog, and ham & cheese. Strawberry was just jam that was probably straight out of a jar from the grocery store, and hotdog was just a normal weiner. Ham & cheese probably had more to it. ..at least there more than one ingredient. Overall taste wise nothing really special. Pinoy waffles are good for their convenience (just grab-and-go) and price. If you want a mouth watering waffle it's probably better to go dine -in at a dessert house."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the price of 3 stuffed waffles for $5! Lady was very nice. We had the ham and cheese, hotdog and chocolate. All were very good, especially the meat filled ones! The hotdog kind of tasted like the auntie Anne ones :b The game and cheese was my favourite :D"}
{"text":"Located on the 2nd floor at Pacific Mall. I was going to get my usually egg waffles and saw this place Pinoy waffles.   At $5 for 3 i had to give it a try. There were dozen of flavor's to choose from. I decided to get the chocolate, custard and purple yam. The chocolate and custard was good, the purple yam was amazing! You have to try it."}
{"text":"Just discovered this great snack bar! They offer Filipino waffles and I have to say they are delicious. They have both savoury and sweet options. My fave is the cheese and ham, but they also have great flavours like ube, strawberry, hotdog, and cream cheese. A must try at Pacific Mall!"}
{"text":"I have never before seen this concept of centre-filled waffle sticks (that's the best way I could think to describe it), but I thought it was an amazing idea. And when I tried it I ended up loving it.  Staff: A gentleman was acting as the cashier and a lady made the food. He had given us a heads up that it would take about 4 minutes to make. I can always appreciate places that take the time to let us know how long our food will be. We ordered three for $5.00 but you had the option to do the one for $2.00.  Location: It is upstairs of Pacific Mall and located near the front entrance of the food court area.  Food: We had ordered one with a hotdog, one with custard and finally one with apple cinnamon. The hotdog brought back the child in me, reminding me of all the hotdog filled buns growing up. The custard was very yummy and oozing with a lot of custard. The last was an apple cinnamon which was my least favourite since it wasn't as sweet as I would've wanted it.  Fast, friendly service, fresh food; I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in the mall!"}
{"text":"I got three waffles (ube, cheese, and custard) for $5 and they taste fine. It's as you'd expect it to taste - a waffle with chosen taste in the centre.  The ube one was alright, nothing very special about it. I wished the cheese flavour had more cheese and was gooey or stringy. As for the custard, I probably enjoyed that one the most because it was runny as I had expected of the custard flavour.  I will probably be back to try the other flavours. Out of the three I tried, I would most recommend custard."}
{"text":"I have walked by this place a dozen times before I decided to finally try them out after seeing a handful of positive reviews off Yelp.  This place is very tiny and is located right behind the egg waffles store on the 2nd level of Pacific Mall. They never seem to be busy so that's why I was a little hesitant on trying them out.  They have about a dozen different fillings you can choose for your waffle, priced at $2 each or $5 for 3. I chose the ham&cheese, chocolate and custard.  The ham & cheese one was delicious, a slice of ham with cheese oooozing out. The waffles were made to order and piping hot when I received them.. delicious and at a great price! Will definitely be back to try more flavours!"}
{"text":"We really liked this place!  On a recent trip to pacific mall, we had to stop in and try some of these waffles. The gentleman working there was very nice and we opted for the dark chocolate filled and the custard filled waffles.  The waffles were ready in 4 minutes, and as promised, they are made fresh while you wait. They were hot and fluffy and crispy on the outside and the fillings were pudding-like and plentiful, some of the filling was actually bursting out the bottom of the waffle.   This is a little food stand upstairs in pacific mall and it's something a bit different than the egg waffles and bubble teas which are rampantly common in that area of the plaza. I would have liked to try the sausage and some other flavours but I was looking more for dessert and this definitely hit the spot. Next time we go to Pacific mall I'll be sure to make a point to come back to try other flavours!"}
{"text":"Cute little place in Pacific Mall on the 2nd floor in the food court.  The lady who was helping us was really nice and suggested the ham & cheese waffle.  She also told me that this is a very popular snack in the Philippines.  Since it was only 3 waffles for $5, we decided to try the ham& cheese, hotdog, and the purple yam.  I really like the purple yam one.  These are really good!  It's a perfect snack and so cheap."}
{"text":"Heard about this new filipino waffle place via instagram. Thought I'd give it a try since you typically dont find filipino snacks in pmall. Located upstairs foodcourt in the central lane where the bridge is.   $2 per waffle or 3 for $5 so I bought 3. They have a mix of savoury and sweet. I bought a ham and cheese, blueberry, and ube. Took around 7 minutes. The ham and cheese was alright. Probably kraft singles and sliced ham. Because they were freshly made, the cheese was nice and oozing out of my waffle when I bit into it. The blueberry one was jam filled and nice and sweet. They also serve halo-halo (filipino icecream drink) for $5.    Service was friendly. Happy to see family-run businesses.   Overall, price is reasonable for the waffles which were not bad (nothing extraordinary). But again, there are so many waffle places in pmall...Would like to see them start selling more traditional filipino street snacks!"}
{"text":"This is honestly one of the first 5 stars I've given at PMall.  The lady here who owns the store is very sweet and she does fluently speak English - so don't be afraid to chat with her! She sells these cyclinder-like waffles and that was a must try for me. The waffles are a little fluffier and sweeter than eggie waffles and they hold different fillings. She has savoury flavours like ham&cheese and hotdogs or sweet fillings like ube, chocolate, custard etc.   She cooks them when you order so it's an average 3-4 minute wait.  It's $5 for 3 and $2 for 1.  Get the deal - it's honestly worth it.  FYI: Try the ham & cheese, the ube, and the custard."}
{"text":"Ever since I heard about this concept of waffle stuffed fillings, I was on the ball to getting my tastebuds some. Last weekend, I finally got a chance to stop by Pmall and try them out. We ordered the cinnamon apple, purple yam (ube) and custard flavour.  Upon ordering, we were notified that it will take some time to make. We waited for about 5 mins to receive steamy hot waffle sticks!   I took a small bite into the custard one (remember these things are hot! be careful not to burn tastebuds!) and at first, I didn't taste much of the custard filling. It took a few more bites for me to really taste the custard. The custard filling wasn't too sweet, it goes well with the waffle. As for the cinnamon apple, it smells and tastes like a McDonald's apple pie. Not too sweet at first but, it does get reallllly sweet when you're down to your last bite. The purple yam (ube) was quite hard to taste. Very subtle and light. It would be best if the waffle was made a bit thinner and stuffed with more filling especially for the ube. The waffle is not sweet but could be a bit more fluffy in my opinion. It doesn't have the \"eggy\" flavour taste from those circular egg waffles you'd get at Market Village.   Nonetheless, love the concept and friendly attitude from here. Probably will skip the sweet waffles and try out the savoury ones next time."}
{"text":"Located on the upper floor of the venerable Pacific Mall amongst a plethora of food choices, firstly this place did not open on time as I was there at 12:00PM and it was still closed, but alas around 12:20PM the gates were open and it was waffle time.   Me and my cousin ordered one strawberry filled waffle and one ham & cheese waffle just to get some variation with some sweet and some savory.   We both agreed the strawberry was the better one as the strawberry syrup soaked into the waffle ever so slightly which flavored the waffle which we both also agreed was a bit bland.  Conversely the ham & cheese was fairly pedestrian in flavor, with it's best attribute being that it was nice and warm with the cheese being quite gooey (in a good way).   Overall quite tasty, but not really unique.   FYI: Sorry for no photos of the waffle itself as it was difficult to grab my phone while holding said waffle."}
{"text":"Waffle wrapped snacks, located upstairs in the Pacific Heritage Town. Got the hot dog, tastes exactly like a waffled wrapped hot dog. The ends might not have been cooked all the way, batter was still a little wet. Choice of sweet or savoury fillings. One for $2 or three for $5, also sells drinks and coffee."}
