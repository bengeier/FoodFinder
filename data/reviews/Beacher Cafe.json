{"text":"I probably eat here more than my house!  Nice, simple, easy, fresh and good.  This has been the go to brunch in The Beach for many years and it's easy to see why.  Lunch is also well done and good choices with daily specials changing things up here and there.  No disappointments here!"}
{"text":"friendly staff, coffee and creme brulee is nice, place is old, a kinda european style, i do not know about their washrooms but place seemed clean, will go again"}
{"text":"The Beacher has been part of Queen Street East for a little over 20 years. In that time it has evolved with the changing face of society. One might say this modernization has been a double edged sword for us locals that grew up in the area and remember when their prices matched the quality and quantity of the food, not the $1000 paintings on the walls and the nouveau \"trendiness\" of the location.  Please don't get me wrong; the food is quite nice and I've never met a rude server. It is very clean. The atmosphere is wonderfully relaxed and pleasant, while the spacious accommodations assure that every patron is welcome to stay after their meal to nurse a cup of coffee while chatting with friends.  However, over the years I have seen the portions shrink and the prices climb, fluctuating heavily with the seasons and holidays/festivals. At times I've wondered if The Beacher has mistaken its food prices for the daily gas-prices.  Please refer to my attached photo for an example of \"Jazz Fest\" prices. After eating this thimble-full of salty and burned soup* I commented to a staff member in a humorous/serious tone that I had never had soup that cost 50 cents per spoonful. To their credit not one, but two servers apologized and agreed that it was overpriced, and even volunteered the owner's email address to formerly complain. (No response yet, dare I hold my breath?) Regardless, when the servers feel embarrassed to hand customers their bill you know something is definitely wrong.  (Don't even get me started on the portion size of that $8 hummas.)  But despite the glaring flaws that have crept into the carefully maintained image of being a 'family friendly & affordable restaurant', I still like The Beacher. I enjoy going there with friends after a long walk on the beach, or in the late evening for a bottomless cup of coffee and some good conversation. (Their late closing hours are wonderful.) I simply no longer order anything larger than an appetizer.  A few years ago I might have given 4 stars, a couple years ago I might have awarded 3, but between the portions/quality I've received lately and the added insult of price-gouging, I feel compelled to offer up a solid 2. If I could award a 2.5 I would.  * Due to a pre-existing medical condition I needed to eat immediately and did not have the luxury of sending the soup back and walking out."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken sandwich....hangover cure!  Good for kids, give fruit and colouring books to start. Sadly no chocolate pancakes. (Chocolate sauce on the side...odd)  The service is hit or miss. Some days very friendly, some days a little rude.   Very good diner, one of the best in the beach!"}
{"text":"Comfort food in a pleasant and relaxed setting.  I'm a regular here and appreciate it when I am greeted warmly and my preferences remembered.  Like coming home."}
{"text":"I have lived in the Beach since I was a young lad, so I am very familiar with the Beacher Cafe.  It is one of my favourite places to go for brunch, lunch and dinner in the beach area.    In all of the year's that I have been going ...  I have only run into one server (the bald guy) that works there who's manners leave little to be desired, but otherwise the wait staff are very friendly and attentative.  Food is good!  And the deserts are from Dufflet's - so of course they are awesome!"}
{"text":"We LOVE The Beacher - they are especially great with kids, to the point where we go pretty much weekly with our toddler for breakfast. The very nice servers bring out a snack of watermelon and some water for our son as soon as we sit down, as an example. We have gotten to know the staff by name, as have they gotten to know us.  The food is good caf√©/family restaurant food - big portions/good prices. The french toast is a very good bet, which some mornings verges on magical. The steak dinner is also good; two plus a toddler meal and some wine for dinner was pretty reasonable and totally satiated my steak craving."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot - it's better then most of the places closer to the heart of the beaches.  You can actually find parking around this cafe!   Good food, good service, will be returning soon."}
{"text":"This spot is our go-to for brunch and we absolutely love it.  The bennies are great and live up to their reputation, french toast never disappoints.  The best of all is the service, always above and beyond and they get to know their regulars too!"}
{"text":"Disgusting.  Third time and each time has been progressively worse. I left wondering if I was going to suffer food poisoning.  Scary!    FOOD The food is nothing special.  Ho hum diner food done poorly.  Their breakfast has the most hope, but don't dare to eat there at lunch or dinner once the food has sat around. For example, my lunch salad looked like it wilted under the sun. I picked out half the slimy leaves before deciding not to touch it.  I very politely brought it up to the clueless server who tried to justify it saying \"I dunno what happened.  I mean we get the stuff in fresh\" --- which tells me they do not store things properly and do not take ownership.  Gross.  They did not voluntarily take it off the bill.  We asked another server who brought our bill to see if it would be adjusted and they still did not.  I get the impression they were too intimidated by management to do so since she sheepishly gave us the bill.  Not good.    My other half's homefries tasted like they fossilized on the back of the griddle since the morning.  Sometimes those brown crispy bits are divine, but this was far from edible.  The chicken breast was dry, but thankfully hot so I know it was at least cooked through. The chicken sandwich said it came with a spicy mayonnaise, but there was no sauce. The bun was an overly sweet, super squishy Wonderbread type.  The glass of water tasted a bit chlorinated.  SERVICE We felt like we were held hostage trying to get the servers attention and our check.  We were there easily an extra 45 minutes more than necessary because of this!  Each time we have been, there has been an issue waiting for a long time for the bill and credit card machine.  AMBIANCE It is rather run down.  It may have been a favorite back in the day for the locals, but it is tired and needs an overhaul.  I don't think they have any air conditioning and the breeze from the beach does not make up enough for it.    SEATING  They have a narrow strip of raised patio seating that is hard to get into.  Some tables have one side of the table through one door and the other side accessible only from another sliding door -- which is awkward to go around a whole row of tables to get at.  I swear their crowded seating is not to code.  It's way too crowded.  I can only imagine trying to get past diners if the place was full.  LOCATION It's further east along Queen St, so you can avoid most of the tourist and beach crowds.  PARKING Usually a nightmare on Queen St in the Beaches --- especially in warmer months.  You can sometimes find free side street parking.  There is metered parking along nearly all of Queen St in that area.  ACCESSIBLE There are a few stairs down into the restaurant and stairs up to the seating areas.  The seating is cramped so I doubt a wheelchair could maneuver."}
{"text":"Seriously meh, bordering on blech.  Location: wonderful.  The sun was streaming through the window on a cold morning and we felt our restaurant choice for breakfast was perfect.  Then came the food.  Bacon: lukewarm Toast: cold.  (npte: you have to ask if they offer any other type of bread ; it isn't offered and they will automatically serve whole wheat??!!).   Potatoes: stone cold.  Poached egg: perfect (except they forgot to drain so toast was wet and vinegary). Orange juice: I'm betting on Tropicana. Service:  slow.  Overall:  won't return."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal at The Beacher! Their food is delicious, the atmosphere is very cozy and the service was fabulous!  The owner came to see us at our table and made us feel so welcome! We have finally found our brunch place!"}
{"text":"Very good eggs Benny.  Chocolate chile  con carne terrible - tastes like its right out of the can."}
{"text":"Good and quick to get is coffee , menu looked delicious but didn't eat there , the restaurant smelt good food smell so I assume it's good place to eat as well . Coffee was good , place maybe a little bit pricey but overall good"}
{"text":"I think this spot appeals to the all day breakfast crowd.  We showed up on a weekday around noon and the place was somewhat empty.  I can pretty much have eggs and toast at home so thought we would try a couple of relatively simple lunch options.  Rather than beer or wine or coffee we opted for \"fruit smoothies\" .   Laughable at best.  These are quite expensive smoothies and I can honestly say that the golden archs make better smoothies than this place.  These were basically slushees with lots of crushed ice and some sort of fake fruit taste but if there was strawberry in mine it was well pulverized.  My wife had the mango which was equally appalling.  I guess for a kid this might be appealing but these days the public has a pretty sophisticated palate and most people would find these drinks too sweet and fake tasting.  Not really refreshing.  I ordered the club sandwich which boasted \"real turkey\" as the key ingredient along with peameal bacon and tomato and lettuce.  My wife ordered the fish and chips.   Sadly, both meals were poor quality, almost cafeteria like in some respects.  The fries had this odd oil odour so I suspect some sort of super cheap no specific quality of oil was used.   Thin type fries like the archs .  These fries were freshly cooked, I'll give you that but I could not finish them.   The fish was mostly batter and the haddock seemed a bit undercooked in my estimation.   It was edible but poor quality compared to other fish places I have been. My club was totally hilarious.  Three thin pieces of regular old brown toast with what I can only describe as sliced turkey breast that was seared on a flat top.  Usually when you order real turkey in a club it is like chunks of breast not thin sliced.   The bacon was also very very thin and cooked on a flat top.   The only saving grace was the tomato and lettuce which seemed to be decent quality.  Frankly, I would not recommend the club although the waitress said it was a very good club.  Trust me, this is very poor quality.  The mayo or whatever was ok.  For a weekend get the family out of the house at 10 am and have a quick brunch this is likely an ok place.  I never ate the all day breakfast stuff but I suspect it is better than the club and the ultra battery fish.   The first thing the server dropped on our table were glasses of water.  I asked, is this tap water. To which she answered with an odd smile,  well yes  tap water.  I know the city claims this stuff is just as good as bottled but in a restaurant these days, you would expect at least to filter the water to get rid of the chlorine smell and taste.  Service is adequate but never once did anyone ask how the meal was, or how the drinks were. The other items on the menu board seemed interesting but generally not the kind of stuff or quality I would accept.  I guess for the dollar value and the location, right on queen street, this place is OK but I would not go back."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch place in Toronto. Been to most of them, as that is a Saturday tradition with me and this one takes the cake. High-end, medium costed food. Great service. Lots of room (people not bumping into your the whole time). There is a nice patio for warmer days and you can get in and our in a hurry.   I used to drive around going to new places but I've since stopped. This place rules. Eggs Benjamin!"}
{"text":"This is a greasy spoon...I got what I expected. Cold beer, hot food, and friendly, fast service. The food wasn't gormet but, what I expected. I would recommend this spot for someone looking for a comfortable spot."}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot.  Really good food, reasonable prices, decent enough coffee.  Has a patio I'd like to hit when it's warner, but it is a fine option for brunch in the east end.  Kids seemed to like it too, if I lived further east I'd have it as a regular brunch spot."}
{"text":"This time my friend took me to The Beacher while visiting her in the end of Queen Street East. She said the seafood section is very good here, so I had to try. This was just before my trip to Nova Scotia, so I decided to have daily special of mussels in wine sauce. My friend had a nice cocktail and a baquette. Food came fast and my mussels looked great and smelled the same! They were accompanied by few slices of bread and butter. When they were gone, server brought me more. It was definitely a hearty meal. Nothing to take with me, as I ate it all :)   This was a nice-looking place, not busy for a summer afternoon, there were plenty spots on the patio, so that is where we enjoyed your meals. The menu could be more interesting though, as I think I wanted something more substantial than just mussels, but there was not much to order."}
{"text":"Mice, giant silverfish, lack of hygiene from kitchen staff (not something that is ever ok when preparing food!), cooks smoking in the kitchen, cooks eating fries from customers plates before it goes out and then putting it back, crap quality of food. I could go on. How is this place not shut down yet??? I vomit in my mouth just thinking about all the violations this place makes in a day. Owner doesn't care about his customers or employees, just about making money as cheaply as he can. One good thing out of this mess: the servers."}
{"text":"I came here on the second night of the jazz festival after the festival closed down, so it was nice to be warmly greeted and seated at 11:00.  But I have to say the food was disappointing. They had Jazz festival specials, but the ones eaten at my table weren't cooked anywhere near the jazz festival in the Beaches.  The french fries were dry -- right out of the freezer and microwave, with Heinz ketchup brought to douse them. The lamb was dry, no sign on having been cooked, just rethermed, like it was a hospital. In my book on the No Nonsense Guide to World Food, I mention that France is working to uphold the traditions of restaurant cooking as home-cooked ie cooked in house by local people, bringing good jobs to the neighborhood where customers come from.  Restaurants in France get to put home-cooked on the window if the meal isn't ordered in from a distributor who mass produces no-name restaurant food imitations. Restaurants, especially if they parade their jazz festival banner as if they're part of the community, need to act like part of the community, hire local cooking talent, offer local wines or beers (there were none, except foreign-owned industrial beer manufactured in Ontario). Beachers are loyal to this place, especially for the breakfasts, which are cooked in-house. Time to apply the same principle to dinners and lunches."}
{"text":"Back for a perfectly good breakfast, with friendly, attentive service, and above average toast."}
{"text":"Always a winner, good service, friendly staff. Good for breakfast. A friendly place that's been in the Beach a long time. I had the Cajun Cease, very good and my husband had beef hash with poached eggs special, also good. Coffee is fresh."}
{"text":"We visited Beacher because it was listed as one of the kid friendly restaurants in the area.  We were seated and left alone for a good 10 minutes. Not a problem. As we're ordering, my daughter is playing with a glass, the waiter pulls the glass from my daughters hands, completely awkward and uncalled for. We don't make a big deal. Food arrives, very generic, very flat. I would have expected more from an establishment that has been there for so long."}
{"text":"Meh! The old waitress was The Worst. I asked her what the soup of the day was and her response, \"it's on the chalkboard, can you read it... (Realizing that was rude)... From here?\" I couldn't believe it. My friend had to ask for her cup of coffee twice and sauce for breakfast dish twice. So many cute restaurants, don't bother with this one. I do believe in second chances, but this first impression yielded two stars, I'll say it TWICE, TWO STARS!!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad. I guess people get really attached to spots simply for nostalgia's sake, but when I came here they were out of draft beer, the food was cold, the server was crabby and the kitchen staff angry. Don't know what's going on here, if it's different management from the past or what, but the whole experience was pretty pathetic."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. I liked the looks of the patio right on Queen St. It's East of the busiest part of the Beaches, and a bit more laid back.   'Meh. I've experienced better' perfectly describes my meal today. I'm not big on burgers and sandwiches, so i ordered the Chicken Fingers. It came with fries AND caesar salad, which i thought was a great deal for $10.99. But when it came the chicken fingers were 'meh'. Kind of greasy. The salad was 'meh', no bacon bits and a bit soggy. The fries were okay. It also came with plum sauce, which i like. All in all... left me feeling nothing much of anything.  Also... the carpet in the interior scared me alot :S Ewww... grossly stained. Please replace that."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at this place for as long as I've been living in the  neighbourhood.   Time passes, servers have come and gone, but the menu, the main chef and the owners have remained the same. While some might argue that this isn't a good thing I beg to differ. Why change a menu that has obviously worked so well? Also while the menu hasn't really changed in a while the daily specials do and they usually offer some amazing stuff.   Having been to this place so many times, I eventually found my favourite dishes and whenever I visit I always have one of them. They are either the chicken on a bun sandwich (with fries) or the Mediterranean or Classic pizza. I'd say that the quality is there 99% of the time.   The location is great, the owners are fantastic and fortunately the new servers always seem to be spot on too.   I had some experiences that weren't the best but each and every time I raised a concern, the feedback was well received and I was provided with a satisfactory resolution. But don't get me wrong, fortunately the below par experiences are few and far between.   Breakfast brunch is pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"Came here on a random summer evening. Perfect weather allowed us to sit comfortably on the patio. This place serves decent food at decent prices. How Canadian! I would say that the service was better and more friendly than most neighbourhood establishments. I had the fish and chips - the battered fish was yummy, the fries satisfying with the vinegar- based purple coleslaw being the only 'meh' part of the meal. The others had a steak sandwich (yummy) and a blue cheese burger (can't comment. Blue cheese is a no-go in my books!). It's a fairly chill place for an evening meal."}
{"text":"Came for Saturday breakfast and really enjoyed it.  There were plenty of available tables so we didn't have to wait. Service was friendly and surprisingly fast. We both ordered off the specials menu - I had the eggs benny prosciutto and my wife had the omelette.  The benny was excellent - real hollandaise (a must!) but their twist was to serve it on prosciutto instead of ham and add some pesto to the hollandaise to complement the italian flavours. The egfgs were good quality and perfectly cooked. They also substituted gluten free bread for me without any issues - nice!  The omelet was also excellent - bacon, peameal bacon, green onions and mozzarella made for an delicious flavour combination.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The family dropped by for birthday brunch on the weekend, and we were happy with the food & service.  The sausages and bacon were great, and the eggs were really good.  OJ is Tropicana, but the morning glory is fairly well priced at $6.  We didn't have room for cake.  A friendly, bustling spot, and not direly expensive!"}
{"text":"This is a really family-friendly place.  The food is classic north-american diner quality.  Service is fast, staff are friendly, food is fresh.  Fruit on the side is always good.  The kids love the waffles, fruit and bacon. We're regulars because of this."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. I have been a patron of The Beacher Cafe since 2004. Brunch is very good and I tried them all, my favourite is the Smoked Salmon Scrambled Eggs and The Egg Benedict that comes with the famous Beacher Hollandaise sauce. But my first choice will always be the Chicken on a bum with fries I think I ordered this several times. The desserts ( from Dufftlet ) are amazing and my favourite is the chocolate mousse. They also have specials: I love the Penne with Shrimp in white whine garlic tomato sauce ( this is to die for) and the mushroom soup. Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch with a group of five. Service was fast and attentive, eggs benny was delicious and I have to say everyone seemed to love their choices. Food is very reasonable and they have a decent brunch selection...am going to try the french toast next time as a friend had this and it looked so good.  Update - was back again! Fantastic, despite the fact that this place was super busy the waiting staff were attentive and food came out fairly fast. They claim to be well known for their hollandaise sauce and quite rightly so....it's perfect! This place is, in my opinion, a must for Sunday brunch at the beaches!"}
{"text":"We ended up here for breakfast on an early Monday morning because none of the interesting-looking places in this unfamiliar neighbourhood were open.  It provides competent renditions of brunch menu standards (eggs benedict, smoked salmon scramble) at standard prices, and (like most breakfast places) mediocre coffee, and that's about all there is to it.  The service was pleasant and sunny, and the dining room is spacious and clean.  I'll have to take others' word for it that it's one of the better places in the area, since I can't imagine making this neighbourhood into a dining destination."}
{"text":"It's baaaaddddd. I live 2 blocks away and want to love this place, but because of the bad reviews, have stayed away. Until this afternoon when a friend wanted to enjoy the nice day and sit outside. How bad can a cup of coffee, grapefruit juice and pancakes be?  It's worse than Sunset Grill, that's how bad. The melon garnishes were at the point of turning bad...that sour stage, cut with an oniony/garlicky knife. Pancakes tasted like it came from a box and the sausage wasn't cooked inside.  That patio seating sucks you in, but the food makes you want to throw it up. I'm afraid of what their kitchen looks like given the quality of what is plated in front of the guests.  Its only saving grace is the price, but you get what you pay for, eh?"}
{"text":"For years we spent our hard earned cash here. YEARS! Then one day our daughter then 2.5 years old was a tad too loud and rambunctious. We were asked to leave and to go somewhere else!!!!!! The owner of this establishment is unbelievable rude and he has no table side manner. He treats his serving staff terribly and can't hang onto employees. Their food is way over priced and not even that good. I am only too happy to spend my hard earned cash somewhere else. Somewhere where the food is worth the asking price and the standards of cleanliness are higher.  Spend your money elsewhere in the Beach. There are businesses that are much more deserving."}
{"text":"My partner and I love this place. The service is always great and friendly. I love ordering Brie cheese burger from Beaches Cafe:)"}
{"text":"Walked in here on a Friday evening, not too busy. The decor is lacking, the service was so so and the food was decent at best. But, the nice patio and laid back feeling of the Beach is everywhere in this eatery. Maybe it was our first evening of the spring spent eating outdoors that made us feel buoyant and happy leaving what was really a 2-star dining experience. Would go here again for a burgers & fries kind of thing."}
{"text":"Situated along Queen Street east in the Beaches, this cute mom and pap type of place that's been serving the Beaches community for years. With one of the best patios in the area, the interior though 'timeliness' brings comfort and coziness to those that come here.   Known for their breakfast and brunch, they too have a great selection of dinner specials written on the chalk board.  Unfortunately we were only here for dessert after our dinner affair just down the road. I decided to try their ever-so decadent Toffee apple cheesecake.  Just the sounds of it made me melt lol! As lovely as it sounded, it lived up to its goodness paired with a cappuccino.  The service was excellent and overall experience was great, I'd most certainly would like to come back for a full out meal whether it be breakfast, brunch or dinner."}
{"text":"This place falls fairly neatly into the brunch diner category, in my opinion, which the Beach area has several of. It is classier than your typical breakfast diner in terms of it's atmosphere, and has great natural light, even on days with inclement weather. It has a great elevated street-side patio for the nicer weather. The waiting staff is attentive and friendly. The food is average, and slightly overpriced, but what others have said is true: you're paying for location/atmosphere. Definitely not bad, but don't expect to be amazed."}
{"text":"Stopped here for drinks during Beaches Jazz fest, and was impressed. Nice seating and dining arrangements, half patio and full patio, two sides to choose from (left side being more casual and right side slightly more formal), and great food. I did not eat here, but friends did and their food looked and smelled fantastic, and they said it was very good. Our waitress was a awesome. Her name was Skyler and she was on point all night. Despite the size of our group she kept us in cold drinks all night and patiently split up all our drinks at the end of the night even though the restaurants system did not allow for truly separate bills.   I'll be back. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"When I lived in the Beach, this was our \"go to place\" for Sunday Brunch. While the wait times can be long, the food and friendly staff are worth the standing. This place has the best French Toast I've ever had while dining out. Unbelievably good. My breakfast companion always ordered the Eggs Benny....said it was fantastic.  One of the best places in the Beach for Breakfast"}
{"text":"The beacher has officially become my go-to brunch place in the beach.   We've hit up a few brunch places in the beach and this one has the best food by far.  Obviously, it's no Bonjour Brioche Bakery, but it's close and the fact that there are no wait times seriously gives the place some brownie points.  Plus, the eggs florentine are seriously delicious!  If you are looking for some serious hollandaise sauce, look no further!  My husband has had a variety of things off their menus, and has really enjoyed all of it too.    Cute place!"}
{"text":"Came here last week for the first time in many years. Eggs Benny are always great here. Could use more home fries on the plate but very good overall. Owner will play piano to add that friendly pleasant atmosphere. Nice spot on Queen Street East and the scenery is always great :)"}
{"text":"I live right beside here and really like this place.  The owner here is an absolute diamond. She is so pleasant and welcoming. And always smiling.   The breakfast here is really good and really well priced. I was also surprised at how good the pizza was here. I've had it numerous times and they do it better than most pizza places. I love the BLT croissant every now and again as a treat. It's been in the beaches for many years and the patio is lovely in the summer."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this spot as a dessert spot 1. Because I've only been there once, and only ate dessert 2. Because a search for dessert spots in the Beaches at this time, really yields nothing spectacular (other than Ed's Real Scoop, but since these places are nearly side by side, you can have your cake and ice cream AND eat them too!)  My boyfriend and I were looking for a dessert spot in the area and weren't overly excited about booking it out to the nearest Cafe Demetre on the Danforth, so we thought  we'd  just cruise down Queen Street East and test our luck. We saw the cute, candlelight Beacher Cafe and thought we'd drop in. We weren't disappointed - the place has a number of fresh cakes and pies by the slice, and a diverse menu of wines and specialty cocktails. My boyfriend was even able to order a B52, as they had no specialty coffees on the menu (the only thing that was a little strange, as it's winter and all the cocktails listed were iced) and yet it was made perfectly to order. We had the Chocolate Raspberry Cake and 1 slice was giant enough to satisfty the sweet tooth of us both.  We were the only couple in the place at 9 pm on a Saturday, but that didn't stop us from throughly enjoying our dessert. Great spot overall!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and ordered the Eggs Florentine which substituted a croissant for the English muffin as the base.  The poached eggs were cooked well, the spinach was a little bland, the hollandaise was middle of the road and the croissant was hard and greasy.  It's a sleepy cafe which is all about location, location, location.  The patio overlooking Queen street is cool. The decor in general is outdated.  It's a nice stop but I wouldn't go out of my way to hop the Queen Street streetcar to get there."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars, I would.  Arrived, sat outside on their patio got some menus and water.  Waited over 10 minutes with barely anyone inside the restaurant to place our order and the server never came back.  Brought the menus back inside and said that we've waited far too long to get any type of service to which I got no reply or apology.  We were forgotten about.  Won't be going back here in a hurry.  Lots of other places to spend the money."}
{"text":"Food very so-so, but great summer patio at a prime Beach location."}
{"text":"Holy *)(^#$&*) this is awful.  Sure, the location is wonderful, as is is the patio. But, that's it. No, really. Lets put it this way; real beacher's don't eat here.  While breakfast service is quick and friendly, the food is inedible. Uncooked and undercooked food seems to be the rule. Weak coffee with expired creamers.   I'm afraid the Lunch and Dinner experiences don't fair better."}
{"text":"This is a nice local restaurant, defiantly in line with the feel of the beaches. Good food not to pricey. The service can be a little slow but not so much that you feel you're being ignored. Will definitely go back for the all day breakfast."}
{"text":"My Saturday morning craving for Eggs Florentine got me on the horn with Abby \"I miss runny eggs and hard liquor\" R, who was happy to indulge me in a last minute jaunt to this Queen East establishment.   The decor is pure Valhalla Inn circa 1983, complete with carpeted floors and brass railings. It actually reminds me of the not-yet-reno'ed IHOPs in upstate New York. The brunch menu is compact with lots of eggy options, including the aforementioned Florentine for a mere $9.40.   The florentine was served on two fresh croissant halves (yum!) with a side of boiled and fried up potatoes, peppered so slightly with Hungarian paprika and some other spices. Hollandaise was subtle and not overbearing and the eggs were poached just right.   As you may already know I like my spinach only slightly wilted and definitely not thawed or canned. The spinach was wonderful although there was far too much of it. I had several mouthfuls of spinach but when I looked down on my plate there was still at least a cup of it (in wilted form). Quite frankly my digestive tract was in oxalate overload.  Service was polite and attentive. I'm dead chuffed that I now have a new option for benny in The Beach!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot to go when hungover, and no patience to wait at a trendy Leslieville brunch spot (not knocking them!).  Very traditional brekkie place. My go-to mean is the Eggs Benjamyn (Pouched eggs w/ smoked salmon).   Service is speedy. Patio is great for ppl watching in the Beaches."}
