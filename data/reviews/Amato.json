{"text":"Good service ,standard Italian menu  . Went on a week night parking was not a problem   .  Very pretty terrace ."}
{"text":"Service was amazing but I do recommend reservations as we were almost turned away at the door on a rainy Saturday night. Ordered the table side caesar salad, carpaccio and pasta. Finished with a fruit dessert. Everything was delicious. We shall return for sure!"}
{"text":"Went here today.   Started off with a beef carpaccio,very thinly cut with good flavour.  For my main I had the veal and asparagus with lemon.   The veal was quite delicious and very flavourful.   My wife had pappardella with beautiful cherry tomatoes.  I preferred what she had.  The pasta was very fresh and the seasoning on the tomatoes was quite delicious.

The only negative was the wait time.   From sitting around 715, the mains came around 930.

Food is good but dinner really takes up your whole evening, limiting options for after dinner."}
{"text":"It took us years to find this hidden jewel but now it's always a pleasure to eat at Amato's. Great service and delicious food.
They have a nice terrasse in the back that will make for an unforgettable evening. The Cesar salad, with dressing made fresh at your table, is a must.
Pastas, risottos... they are ALL delicious choices.
You HAVE to try it!!!!"}
{"text":"Located in a beautiful home that was converted into a s small restaurant that provides its guests with authentic Italian cuisine.


Pros :

- Ideal for that romantic atmosphere. Celebrating an anniversary and want a quiet evening with your loved one? This is the place.

- Beautiful decorations with perfect lighting. Hard to describe a week afterwards but honestly, this place was just perfect for a romantic evening.

- Ordered \"Tortellini con prosciutto, pomodoro, funghi e crema\" as a main course.... it was fantastic and I'm a huge italian cuisine critic. Probably the best italian dish I've had outside \"Casa di Mama\".

- Plenty of options to order.

- Service was perfect. Our waiter, Umberto was charming and helpful. Make sure to ask him your questions and which deserts are made in house.

- Their \"Tiramisù al caffè\" was really reaaally good.


Cons :

- Can get expensive so unless you have the means, this isn't exactly a place you go on a weekly basis. Just perfect for the right occasions. Table hote however is reasonably priced however.



Definitely going on my favorite list and will recommend to family and friends.

Make sure to reserve ahead of time, seating is limited.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Selon moi ce n'ai pas seulement un Resto Italien comme on en retrouve dans chaque régions, c'est beaucoup plus un endroit paisible et chaleureux autant à l'intérieur qu'à l'extérieur avec une magnifique terrasse à l'abris des regards. 
Pour le menu je dirais que tous les plats sont choisi, pensé et réfléchis par leur chef et sont servis avec présentations digne des plus grand restaurants typiquement italien au monde! 
Les racines de ce restaurants ne sont plus à faire, l'ancien propriétaire \"Tony\" était l'un des restaurateurs les plus connus à Laval pour sa finesse dans les plats italien et à réussi à transmettre ses recettes à ses neveux Tony et Dominique. (Ils sont très gentils et agréables, on dirais deux frères jumeaux!)

Situé dans le vieux St-Rose, l'ancienne maison d'époque transformé en restaurant ajoute une expression de charme pour un dîner d'affaires ou un souper en couples ou avec amis! 

Pour l'endroit et le décor, je donne un 5
Pour la finesse des plats je donne un 5+
Pour la carte des vins, un 5
Pour l'accueil et le service je donne un autre 5+

P.S. Les serveurs peuvent aussi vous surprendre en vous cuisinant quelques plats directement à votre table, Comme une délicieuse salade César, un petit désert remarquable et pour finir la soirée un petit café alcoolisé!

Je vous recommande très fortement cette endroit."}
{"text":"What a wonderful, authentic Italian restaurant in a cozy location.  

The seating is very limited so reservations are definitely Recommended.  

I went with a meal that wasn't in the menu, veal parmigiana.  I basically said \"I feel like veal but prefer a parmigiana\" and he said \"no problem, we can make that for you\".  It was delicious and the fact it was made by request sold me even more on this restaurant.  

We had a bottle of red wine which was recommended and it was excellent.  The chocolate mousse and espresso were all on point and delicious.   

I will definitely be back.  

Enjoy!"}
