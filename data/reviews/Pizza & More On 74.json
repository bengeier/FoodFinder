{"text":"this comes in second to standard pizza on Haywood rd. West Asheville (by Ingles) -very very good. John got the pineapple ham and bacon pizza(small) good and he even liked it as leftovers. I got the spinach salad. The salad dressing was the best raspberry vinaigrette dressing I have had .

This was about a couple months ago."}
{"text":"Fairview seems to have a lot of pizza places and I say this one is the best. I believe it is a takeout/delivery place only and it's kinda weird b/c I think it might be a converted house but whatever. Solid pizza. I enjoy saying the full restaurant name.

I\"m updating my star rating b/c I have ordered takeout from here A BUNCH. I've had several chef salads (good), calzone (so good I wish to  not ever know the fat/calorie count), Italian dishes and hot subs. All good."}
{"text":"The dough used here is amazing. The pizza isn't too thick or thin. The pizza is very fresh and has just the right bite. The cheese bread is ridiculous as they use long thin twisted bread then cover them all with a thick layer of cheese. Amazing!"}
{"text":"the calzone is off the charts.  trust me i'm from florida (nj/ny)"}
