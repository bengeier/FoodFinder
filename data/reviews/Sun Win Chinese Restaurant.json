{"text":"Picked up some food here last night including the guilty pleasure that is the sweet and sour chicken ball. I had great hopes of just eating one or two but ended up destroying them.  These were the Cadillacs of chicken balls, folks. Inside the crispy golden brown shell of batter was a fully discernible one square inch, juicy piece of chicken breast. They were fantastic. 

We also got a vegetable noodle dish and the Szechuan chicken which was a lot spicier than I thought it would be.  This was a good thing!   Each of these dishes were loaded with vegetables. The Szechuan dish had broccoli, celery, carrots, and baby carrots but there was certainly no lack of chicken.  The noodle dish had the same but with snow peas and bok choy. 

I don't know how this place does it but the food was relatively inexpensive ($6-7 per item), the containers were filled to bursting  and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"It's your typical neighbourhood takeout spot.  It's close to work and better than the nearest food court.   I love these small family run places."}
{"text":"Heard great things about this place so I thought the food would be outstanding and what it was mostly was a pile of grease.
I have only had it once but I would  not go again.
Maybe it was an off night."}
{"text":"We were literally driving on the 401 when The Daughter said \"I'm hungry, can we get Chinese\".   Had to Yelp on Chinese, found this place \"nearby\".  (Nearby is relative when you are going 120.)  Had to backtrack a bit, but the rating seemed to show it was worth it.  Best exit is Brock Road, go south to Bayly.
Delicious!   Best chicken balls ever.   Egg rolls were fantastic.  Everything was great.  I admit it, The Daughter and I gorged ourselves.  Hit the spot.
Everyone was great - cheerful, happy.
Note:  Takeout only, no seating.

Would I return:  Yes
Would I recommend:  Yes"}
{"text":"Sun win use to be a good Chinese take-out but not anymore. They changed owner and the food tast old. I also got grey beef.

The owner offered a credit but I don't want that. I'll be lucky if don't get food poisoning."}
{"text":"What do you mean no chopsticks? How does a Chinese restaurant run out of chopsticks? 

Yeah I'm mad."}
