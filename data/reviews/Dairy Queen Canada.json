{"text":"Nice, clean place, the employees were very friendly to us!! Would definitely go back to this Dairy Queen!!"}
{"text":"This store is in the quaint Bathurst and Sheppard strip mall. Ice cream is up to DQ standards (which means delicious as always). Seating is very limited which is a shame as they have room for a few tables inside. Instead they have one bench inside and another outside.

Staff are friendly and attentive but because it was a slow day for the store, they appeared quite bored. I definitely prefer the location on Dufferin!"}

Now I've been abroad for a decade so excuse my ignoramous attitude, but they don't serve food which is a shame, cuz I loved their Hamburgers back in the day.... with that said, what I really wanted was a strawberry blizzard - now for you young pups, you might be like, WTF - what is a strawberry blizzard, those things only come with some cookie, sugary, chocolate, chubby-gut concoctions. Well I was blown away too, since when I left the strawberry blizzard was a main-stay on the menu.... 

Well upon explaining this to the girl working behind the desk and explaining what a strawberry blizzard was, she put one together for me - bless her little heart. Since they had the promotion get a second one for 99 cents, i decided to try one of these chocolate super duper smack you in the face things, but just wasn't my thing.... 

Moral of the story - be kind, smile and you will get great service - nice one DQ, nice one...."}
