{"text":"I ate at Bri last night before heading to First Friday just down the road. Everything was excellent, including the duck, which is slow roasted over a wood grill. It is tender, flavorful and not in the least bit greasy. The eggplant dip is delicious with flavors of garlic and turmeric. Frico Caldo -- fried potato and cheese pancake with a thick, rich tomato sauce on top -- was amazing. Bri has an excellent selection of wine and beer as well as a number of tasty cocktails. Don't miss this new restaurant in the heart of the historic Coronado district (2221 N 7th Street, Phoenix). I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"GO EAT THERE. Lovely, had a wonderful tapas style dinner with the husband. Split a multiple dishes, all were great if not out of this world(cheese potato pancakes, egg poached in house made broth, duck breast, kimchi green beans). tapas fusion? I would say. Food is clean, unique, and very very good. Cocktails Re top notch, Michael made me one of the better cocktails I have ever had just based on telling him what I like and saying \"surprise me\".  Husband had a wonderful bourbon cocktail. They had local high quality wines and beer on the menus as well. Staff is so nice, food came out very fast. Nice outdoor space, quiet despite being on 7th st. Would highly recommend, reminds me of tapas bars in Spain. I look forward to trying their other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food and service! The Frico Caldo was the best potato pancake we've had in ages. The drooling duck and pork ribs were so flavorful."}
{"text":"Saturday night duck ramen!!! A don't miss along with pretty much every dish on the menu. My new favorite and I kind of don't want to tell because I want to always be able to get a table, but the sincere and warm service alongside really good food - they deserve to be busy and I'll be happy to wait."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a drink a few weekends ago to check out the new restaurant in the neighborhood.  The restaurant had a smell to it and the open kitchen was very unappealing...definitely needs to be covered up or improved.  Both of these things made me NOT want to try anything from the kitchen.  The bartender was very friendly and mixed me up a great drink though - highly recommend That Thing You Do with tequila, lime and blackberry."}
{"text":"Eight of us had dinner here last night.  We had duck, breast and drumstick, spare ribs, the radishes and butter, the string beans, the potato pancake, the noodle salad and the eggplant. And the duck toastie. Everyone enjoyed their meal and we all agreed we would return and try the rest of the menu items. Our server Milo, was wonderful! Explained and described menu items with a smile as the restaurant filled on a busy Saturday night. The crowd challenged the kitchen which nevertheless got us all our orders but one which was a bit late. After tasting the eggplant, one person ordered it for dessert for the table. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"GreAt atmosphere  Little house that has been renovated into a nice restaurant  Owner and staff are very customer friendly and customer oriented   Great drink selection  They do not make any water down drinks   Vast selection of duck First time trying it  Great seasoning and flavor just the duck taste is something I need to work on  Overall great and will be back to support a local business"}
{"text":"Small and intimate with great style. Very customer-friendly. Lots of delicious tapas to try. They look like small plates but they're deceiving; very filling. Pork platter was a hit with tasty and tender ribs. Their house paprika aioli is very flavorful and a perfect pairing for those crispy potatoes."}
{"text":"Just left this eceltic restaurant, stumbled into it, the scent of the smoked mesquite wood got our attention. We began with a delicious white wine blend and a herb seasoned eggplant appetizer. Our friends had the duck sandwich and the ribs. Definitely coming back to this place in the heart of the historic district on 7th st and Monte Vista. What a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"What an awesome place. And the food was amazing. Definitely try this quaint little place out. You won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"The zesty \"kimchi-style\" green bean plate served cold with green onion and herbs atop was absolutely refreshing and delightful...and this is coming from someone who doesn't like green beans! The Smashed Potatoes and Pork Spare Ribs completed the meal. Will be back!"}
{"text":"A very nice bar, great outdoor seating, and cool crowd. I liked the kimchi green beans a lot, though wasn't totally into the mint served with them. Nonetheless, I found them really tasty. The pork ribs were well seasoned and tender, but perhaps a tiny bit fatty. Overall, a great addition to the neighborhood. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We saw the recent write-up on this place so had to try it out.  What a terrific little place.  The place is tiny and super cute and the staff was very friendly and welcoming.  Since this was our 1st time we ordered several items to try, all were excellent - and most were quite rich  It was 2 of us and we don't have huge appetites so we had plenty of leftover.  We started with the cold noodle salad, green beans and bread with eggplant spread.  My favorite here was the cold noodle salad.  My husband really enjoyed the green beans.  I'm not a Kimchee fan so the green beans weren't my thing.   We then got the potatoes,  ribs and Drooling Duck.  All were really great. The spread served with the potatoes was wonderful."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this spot was a restaurant! Stopped by with some friends and we had some delicious cocktails. There's not a huge selection as far as small plates go, but everything on the menu is tasty. They'll whip up cocktails that aren't on their drinks menu and are very friendly and accomodating."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! Wonderful quaint place, just on the edge of Coronado Neighborhood. Drinks were incredible and the food was delicious. We got five small plates and love them all. Must try's are the Frido Caldo and the Poached Egg in Pork Broth. We will definitely be coming back to this spot many times in the near future!"}
{"text":"Had probably the best cocktail I've ever had here, the bartender was awesome and made us several drinks that were not listed on the menu, all of them equally fantastic."}
{"text":"Great spot. Phoenix needs more creative restaurants like this.  An actuall small plates menu...   that has small plates!  Nice Wine program as well.  Pork platter was mouth watering.  Been back a couple times already."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was a weird smell in the restaurant. The Sake punch drink and pork rib were good. The kimchi beans were too spicy and the texture was off putting. The poached egg broth was too salty for my taste. They have really cool tables though."}
{"text":"This place is seriously the best! I love tapas style restaurants because I can get a little bit of everything, and they did not disappoint. The food was so flavorful and they have a TON of vegetarian options! We sat at the bar and the bartender was so friendly and made great drinks! Will definitely be back! Great little Coronado spot!"}
{"text":"First time here. My wife found this restaurant on yelp.  Fantastic service. Please try the pork plater. Lots of good food. Could not eat it all tonight. I'm sure it will be a great midnight snack!"}
