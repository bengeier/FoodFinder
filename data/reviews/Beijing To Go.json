{"text":"I was so impressed by the food we got here last night.  It was cooked well and not overdone at all - aka the veggies were big and still had a bite to them.  I got a shrimp dish and the shrimp were big and well cooked as well.  We also got hot & sour soup and wonton soup and they were great. Everything was tasty and felt fresh.  The service was friendly and prompt.  This will be my new go to for Chinese in Belmont.  I'm surprised this place doesn't have more good reviews!"}
{"text":"I have not tried the food but they do not deliver. Yelp shows they deliver."}
{"text":"It states delivery however I called and they do not have delivery option. Their profile should be updated."}
{"text":"For a Chinese restaurant that's an in and out, this place is one of my favorites I've been to. The chicken tastes like chicken, the food isn't completely covered in grease, and the staff has been kind every time. Would hate to see this one go. Try the general tsao chicken and the dumplings."}
{"text":"I am eating this sub par excuse for food right now and I am disappointed. The fried rice isn't fried, its just undercooked and the chicken taste like plastic. Just a sad plate."}
{"text":"Good food. Go there for lunch often. I work next door to restaurant. My co-workers order often too. Meal sizes are large."}
{"text":"Upon walking in I noticed

Small but clean dining area
Standard Chinese menu
95.5 Sanitation score
Clean kitchen area
A nice young lady smiling, waiting to take my order, which was made very promptly.

Ordered C26 I believe, General Tsaos Chicken. - Delicious.
- Not too much breading on chicken, thumbs up for me
- It wasn't drowned in sauce
- Pork fried rice was a plus

Egg Rolls - Now in my personal top 5 best egg rolls I've ever had. I'm willing to drive an extra 7 miles past two closer chinese places just to have these egg rolls.

Don't let the location and exterior fool you."}
