{"text":"Food the way it was meant to be cooked not processed or salty like a lot of other restaurants yet delicious great food at a good price can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Shrimp and Grits was very nice. Presentation for all of then food we order was excellent. Server tried vey hard and was kind but overwhelmed. Not enough servers during the time we arrived.  Did have a small wait before being greeted."}
{"text":"I have been here three times and each time the service was great and the food amazing. The Mac & Cheese side is outstanding! I am going to have to try a Saturday morning breakfast soon!"}
{"text":"I guess I need to try the lunch because the breakfast was unremarkable and the menu was a very small selection and from what I could see lunch is limited too.  Server was unorganized and we waited over 30 minutes for our food.  2 stars for the Eco friendly attempt-coffee and food served in and on paper recycled cups, bowls and plates although eggs over easy did make the plate soggy, toast was barely toasted and stoned ground grits were hard by the time we got our food."}
{"text":"Delicious, very fresh food.  I ordered the chicken tacos, which came with a cucumber salad.  YUM!  Very reasonable prices.  Simple menu.  Right on main street, the little downtown of Mount Holly.  I will totally go back for more."}
{"text":"An enjoyable relaxing Sunday morning brunch that was more than just breakfast meat and eggs.  The menu is small but it allows the chef, when they want, to be flexible with local seasonal ingredients with reasonable prices.  The service is southern friendly but not attentive enough.  Yes its worth the visit if you find yourself in the vicinity of this quaint southern town."}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Monday (2 adults; 2 teens).  We all ordered something different and everyone was pleased with what they got.  The Spoon  Salad - was a large entry and we ended up bringing half of it home.  My daughter who is a big FATZ fan got the Soup and Spread and indicated she likes this place better than FATZ.  Prices were reasonable, about $7 per entree for lunch.  Desserts were interesting served in mini- mason jars.  Not a coconut fan, but I liked that one better than the apple cake."}
{"text":"Almost always delicious, locally grown offerings, with only two downsides - relatively small portions (for the price), and uneven service.  Staff is always very friendly and accommodating, when they're around.  All in all, it is moving in the right direction since opening, but the\"bang-for-the-buck\" quotient needs to improve a bit."}
{"text":"The have the best shrimp and grits. Located in downtown Mt Holly. Im so glad we finally got some good, quality, healthy restaurants in this area. Support small business!You eat well for under $10"}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits is to die for. Reasonably priced menu and never too loud or busy."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch with all locally sourced food. Not a huge menu, but everything is great."}
