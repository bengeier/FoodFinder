{"text":"When I was a kid I thought the place was the best.  Now that I've actually had real mexican food, I've feel this food is really bland and boring.  Although the burriots are so large I don't think you can walk away hungry."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot.  The choice of ingredients is better than Chiptole; the fresh cilantro is awesome.  But I've been there a handful of times over the past couple years, and I have not had a decently rolled burrito once.  Every once and a while I go back to see if they got someone that knows how to roll a burrito.  They never do.  Its always sloppy and falling apart.  The employees are just a disaffected as the ones at Chipotle, but at least they can roll a burrito there.  On the plus side, I think their Mexican Pizza is still good, and the platos are a great deal.  $6 for a huge mound of food.   I think they give you more in the to go box also. That thing will last you like 3 meals if you have corn chips at home."}
{"text":"After living in CA, I no longer find this place impressive, but for mexican food in Cleveland, it's good."}
{"text":"Service was good today.  Asked for their hottest salsa, and they gave us this orange concoction that looked like it was mostly made out of carrots.  It wasn't.  Wow, it was hot.  Actually pretty blazing, and I think that if a native mid-westerner tasted so much as a fork tine dipped in this stuff, their head would shoot right through one of the big plate glass windows.  I'm from Texas, though, and I liked it.  The rest of the burrito was good, as well.  I'm not sure they deserve 4 stars, but three seems like too few, and I am going to assume that they're on an upswing.  No wireless internet, sadly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite quick-burrito place I've ever been to--anywhere in the world.  Service is quick and simple.  You get in line, you tell them item-by-item what you want, and they make your burrito.  Why do I like this place, and what makes it stand out from others?  The selection of items to put on your burritos is perfect: they offer three kinds of beans (many places offer only 1 or 2), the different kinds of meat are all good, their salsa is very good, and they offer both guacamole and cilantro, both of which are always fresh.  Also, I might add that this place offers a wide variety of salsas, ranging from mild to very friggin' hot.  They also offer tomatillo salsa (my fav.), something lacking from most fast-food burrito places.  There are a few other options (tacos, salads, side of chips, etc.) but basically this is a burrito joint: simple and to the point.  The people working behind the counter are incredibly nice and will recognize you if you are a regular customer, even though it's a busy place.  The atmosphere is nice--it tends to be clean, especially for this sort of establishment, and there is always good salsa music playing.  There's a nice wall mural to add to the character too.  In short, you can't go wrong with this place.  People who prefer Chipotle simply have bad taste."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Que Tal.    Good:  * SImple, bright diner decor.   * Fast, fresh, delicious food * Friendly service  I have not had a single bad meal here.  I specifically love the Muchacha burrito, based on a chicken in a green sauce.  Delicious.  Bad: I do have a small bone to pick with the burrito-wrapping technique at Que Tal.  And not because I care.  It's because EVERY FREAKIN TIME I come here with Sarah, my friend for NorCal friend, I'm treated to a 15 minute tirade about how no one in Ohio knows how to properly roll a burrito, and how these burritos are so great but are just SO HARD TO EAT because they aren't rolled like they're rolled in San Francisco.   I have had this conversation countless times.  For God's sake.  Please, for the sake of my relationship with my dear friend Sarah, please learn to roll the burritos."}
{"text":"You can get a decent burrito here, though I prefer their quesadillas. They're locally-owned, which is nice, but that alone isn't enough reason to get me in the door of a restaurant very often. Frankly Chipotle (up the block toward Euclid Heights Blvd.) does a better job on the food. Plus, Chipotle's chicken and pork are ethically sourced."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of this Mexican restaurant. The food was bland and I left with a little bit of stomach ache. The service was not very efficient or that friendly for that matter."}
