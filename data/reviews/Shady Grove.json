{"text":"This was just average.  The food was average but at least they don't charge more than they should for it.  However, this is not the case with their provolone wedges.  $6 for 3 pieces, seriously??  A huge ripoff.

I had the Shady Burger which is an angus burger with a sunny side up egg in it.  It was ok but for some reason the American cheese in it really got to me.  It was difficult for me to finish the burger because it also reminded me of ordinary-to-bad backyard grilling that my dad used to do.  I ordered a medium burger but it was essentially well-done, with some burn.  I'm also not a huge fan of sunny side up eggs (but my being a fan of eggs overpowered this so I still ordered the Shady burger) and with good reason -- dribbleeee.  It was a mess.

I loved the super crispy french fries though.  

Service was decent.  Atmosphere is decent.  It was nice to be able to sit outside."}
{"text":"Decent food, horrible service. We've tried this place 3 times, and it's been one snotty hostess/server after another. The managers could not seem to care less either. They also seem to get annoyed when you order or even ask about Happy Hour; don't have a HH if you don't want people to order from it! So many better options in the area with better menus and nicer employees."}
{"text":"Last weekend went to Shady Grove yet again. I visit my daughter in Shadyside quite frequently, and love this place - salads are delicious and had an amazing fried green tomato BLT.  In the past Ive had many of the selections and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh visiting for the weekend from Philly.  We were in Shadyside for the afternoon doing some shopping and we decided to eat here.  Sure enough I loved it!

We ordered the onion rings as an appetizer. First the portions were generous but more importantly they were perfectly cooked and battered. (I hate when the onion falls out because of a lack of batter or sogginess due to a bad mix)  

If you like sweet potatoes, make sure you get the sweet potato tots as a side.  They went great with my pesto burger (which was also great).

Overall it was worth the lunch time wait.  I will definitely go back when I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"There's nothing really special here.

The service is slow at the bar and the tables, the place is crowded with Affliction/Ed Hardy T-shirt wearing type guys.  The music is truly terrible dance-pop nonsense.  The food is forgettable without being bad: think Chilis or Outback.  

On the plus side, they do have some good beers available.  But this is Pittsburgh, and that's not unusual at all.  In fact, you can walk a few blocks, say to Bites and Brews or Harris Grill and get an even better selection, usually for the same price or better."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great staff! My girlfriend and I are becoming regulars here. The menu has a wide variety of items with plenty of healthy options available as well. The chicken pesto sandwich is fantastic! Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Shadyside because they have such delicious and HUGE salads.  They also have good Happy Hour deals (half price wine bottles on Fridays - heyy!)"}
{"text":"What a terrible takeout experience today! It took over 30 minutes to make one burger and the final product was not at all what I asked for (had sauce, toppings, etc when I asked for plain). Should have been such and easy order. I will never go back there."}
{"text":"First two times I went here, the service wasn't anything special, but the food - incredible. My small pizza was worth every penny, I ate every bite. My bf got some steak sandwich and it came out with a whole fried egg on top - he looked like he was in heaven. Last time we went there, it was half-off bottles of wine night (Wednesdays), which was a great deal. Place was beyond crowded, but it was worth it - cheap wine, great server, amazing food."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and pizza, great service, good price, and good drinks - and not too expensive.

At the bar there is a large mixed drink selection and I have enjoyed everything.

I lived in Shadyside and came here way more than I should have, and was never disappointed.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident.  Random guy walking down the street recommended 2-3 places to eat.  Great hole in the wall kind of feel.  Great place for a quick lunch!  Had the Pulled BBQ sandwich and fries.  It was delicious and a large amount of food for the money.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone passing through!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for their half-off burgers promo. The place was pretty crowded, even on a Monday night so that says something! That being said, it's probably not the best place to come for a first date or to hold a meeting over a meal because it can get pretty loud. We didn't want to wait for a table, so we opted for the bar instead. 

We got the guacamole deviled eggs as our appetizer and the Shady burger. The deviled eggs came with bacon pieces and tomatoes so it's not just fully guac which was a good thing. The burger was fine, just like any other decent burger. I wasn't a fan of the fries it came with. If you prefer thin fries instead of the thick ones, you might not enjoy the huge portion of fries they serve. 

Overall, friendly staff, good food, and interesting promos every day. Shady grove is a decent choice if you're looking for traditional American food."}
{"text":"Shady Grove is one of my favorite lunch spots in Pittsburgh. They have a great atmosphere compete with a full bar and televisions typically playing the sports games. Throughout the week they have great drink specials such has half off bottles of wine. 
One of my favorite dishes is the buffalo chicken dip. Its not particularly spicy but it is great! Additionally, as a side the sweet potato tots are really good, especially with the sauce they come with."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most popular bars in Shadyside.  They have a  great wine bottle special, and decent (not great) prices otherwise.  The decor is really nice and posh...it kind of makes you want to put on a collared shirt.  The food is also decent, though not spectacular.  Definitely a nice lunch stopover though. 

The problem with the bar is the crowd at night.  I mean it is CROWDED.  It's next to impossible to get a drink at the bar or from the wait staff, who are really trying their best but are just overwhelmed with people!   Drinks are made ok...I wasn't overly impressed.  I want to like the bar more, but the crowds keep annoying me to the point of wanting to leave.  Also, the bar is really packed with the douchiest people in Shadyside as well, so not only are you crowded into oblivion, but also it's like a Jersey Shore episode in there...not fun.  

Overall, it's not a bad place.  The drinks and such are done ok, bue the crowd is just overwhelming at all times.  I'd go elsewhere if given the option."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Modern american bar and grill with a relaxed but somewhat more upscale vibe than your typical neighborhood sports bar.  Downstairs they have a large bar, and a decent number of tables wrapped around the bar area.  They do have plenty of TVs for watching the game, but this isn't really the type of place most people come to watch the tube.  There is an upstairs which is open on busier days and has both seating and its own bar.  The upstairs turns into more of a lounge after 10pm when food service stops including DJs mixing up the beats on some nights.  They also have outdoor sidewalk seating.

Drinks: They have a decent selection of beers including many craft options.  The wine list is fairly long but would leave a oenophile longing for more/better.  I've tried a few of their cocktails, which were good, but I would not describe this place as a cocktail bar.

Food: Shady Grove serves a wide variety of upscale bar food including burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, salads, and some good apps.  I've had the pizza a few times and am I fan of the buffalo chicken pizza.  The burger's are pretty good and are on special on Monday nights for 5 bucks I think.  Last night I had the shishito peppers and ahi tuna salad.  Both were very good.

Service: The service here can be variable.  We've usually had pretty good service but some nights they can get quite busy and then service has lagged, but this is the exception rather than the norm.

Overall: One of my favorite places to meet up with friends for food/drinks in Shadyside.

Tip: Wednesday is a very popular night with the Shadyside Yuppie crowd as it is half off wine bottles night (as is Friday night also).  They used to use the No Wait app but currently don't, nor do they take reservations meaning on busy nights you will need to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure my husband is having a love affair with Shady Grove. He eats lunch here at least once a week, if not more. Occasionally I have the opportunity to join him. Their sandwiches are always solid and their waffle fries are to die for. I recently tried their BBQ chicken pizza and I'm obsessed. Their pizza is fantastic. 
Why a 4?  I wavered between a 4 and 5. I really wish I could give it a 4.5, but I think a 4 is more fitting. Their sandwiches are pretty good, but not quite a 5. Their beer selection is limited which also knocks it down from a 5. There is only a little room for improvement."}
{"text":"I work on Walnut St. and I really like this place.  It has solid food, burgers, pizza etc... and is pretty decently priced for what it is.  Menu items I've had and loved include the spicy Italian sandwich, the pesto chicken sandwich, fish tacos, and the sweet potato tots or waffle fries with cheese and bacon are just junk food awesomeness.  There current drink menu features a champagne cosmo that me and my coworkers love.  They also have a special almost every day with fun stuff like half off wine night or even half off burger day.  Because I work on Walnut I've never really come for dinner, but in summer they have outdoor seating at lunch which is fun, and it's a good happy hour place.  It's definitely worth a try, good easy food and not too pricey."}
{"text":"Food: 6/6
As far as selection goes, this place has it all. Honestly, the menu is huge, featuring salads, pizzas, and sandwiches galore. The food itself though, is delicious. I recommend the Shady Steak Sandwich, which features steak, peppers, potato latkes, a fried egg, and garlic aioli. It is banging. The salads are extremely large, their french fries are particularly amazing, and the pizzas are great too. Overall, probably my favorite food in Shadyside.
Service: 3.5/6
I'm gonna be frank, the service is pretty okay.
Atmosphere: 4/6
It's a decent looking place, but nothing overly special. The music can sometimes be a little strange, or loud, but overall it is always enjoyable to eat here.
Affordability: 4/6
It's not overly cheap, but it's not gonna break your bank. Pretty standard prices for what you're getting, though you do get a lot of food, which is a plus.
X-Factor: 3/6
Nothing extremely special about Shady Grove, besides the Shady Steak Sandwich"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place gets as many stars as it does.  Located in a popular area, I guess.  The food is pretty bad.  If you're looking for a sandwich on somewhat stale bread, with that obvious beginning-to-wilt, straight from the bag lettuce taste/smell permeating the entire sandwich and soup that is just kinda warm... well then, this is your place.  We really should have sent all of our food back, and just said \"sorry, but this is just bad food\"."}
{"text":"Shady Grove is anything but a shady spot in Shadyside. On my recent visit to Pittsburgh, I found it actually to be a pretty decent bar and restaurant.

All weekend long my group attempted to make it to Shady Grove for a bit to eat. We got in too late the first night, the kitchen closed too early on Saturday, but finally we were able to get our fix on Sunday for lunch.

It was kind of perfect actually since they had their Sunday mimosa special. It was $3 for a regular mimosa, applemosa or cranmosa. We also snagged a table outside so got to enjoy some sunshine. 

The second I looked at the menu, I knew I had to try the Goat Pizza. Of course I had to get in on the mimosa deal as well. I had one regular and one applemosa. I enjoyed the apple and champagne however think I might be a standard orange juice mimosa type of gal. 

Although I'm from out of town and this was my first visit to Shady Grove, the Goat Pizza must have been designed with me in mind. It was made up of some of my favorite ingredients: roasted garlic oil, goat cheese, bacon and roasted red peppers. If it included pesto, I may have died of happiness. In any case it sounded a little better on paper. The goat cheese came out as crumbles versus a spread. The menu didn't specify but my dream pizza would have had a creamier goat cheese. I was also expecting the garlic to be a little more prominent on the pie. Don't get me wrong, it was still extremely enjoyable, but I'm just a little picky when it comes to my goat cheese dishes. 

I also got to sample my friend's pierogie pizza which I thought was pretty neat conceptually. I envisioned a regular pizza topped with pierogies however the pizza was topped with the ingredients of a cheddar, onion and bacon pierogie. It was a starch overload but absolutely tasty. My husband went with the jerk grilled chicken fingers. While I didn't try the chicken, the jalapeno mango sauce and cilantro serrano sauce were perfect for dunking my pizza crust. I also got to try a few of my friend's sweet potato tots. I could have easily housed them if he hadn't almost done so already. 

While I love to dine al fresco, Shady Grove is located on a fairly trafficked street off of Walnut. Unfortunately, one street at the intersection wasn't paved well so dirt kept flying up at us when cars drove by. That probably could be avoided by sitting closer to Walnut Street or by sitting inside. 

Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. One of my friends asked what her favorite menu item was and she was able to naturally rattle off a few things she likes and what scenario she usually eats them. It's always a plus when a server enjoys the food from their restaurant and can easily talk to the menu. 

So aside from desire for goat cheese perfection and a little flying dirt, Shady Grove made for a pretty good lunch."}
{"text":"Had a great burger and beer here. Oh and the loaded latkes, best appetizer. Busy lively place with great choices for everyone."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and pizza! The pizza had a sweet crust, which is unique. We had the Aglio pizza, highly recommend. If you favor good quality bread and dough this is the place."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now, and the food is good enough to keep me coming back when I am in the mood for typical American style cuisine at a relatively inexpensive price.

All the food I've had here has been good except for the few times that I've had sandwiches slathered with so much aeoli that I thought my taste buds and breath would never recover.  The interior could use a little bit of renovation since it appears to be somewhat beat up.  The service I've had has always been prompt and polite."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing food.  I have been to shady grove multiple times in the past year and the food never displeases me, you get a lot for the amount you pay.  Highly recommend the chicken chili nachos, spinach and artichoke dip, and the chicken spinach and artichoke sandwich.  Although the service may not be the best, the food is definitely worth it.  They also have great drink specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"Half priced burger on Monday's is all you need to know. They got a good beer selection at awesome prices, and the food is consistently great. Not just pub food. Good pizzas, burgers are really good...a great Shadyside staple that deserves all the business it gets."}
{"text":"Was not too bad for a bar type atmosphere.  I tried the deviled eggs. Delicious. Also tried the chipotle style pizza and it was pretty good. I'd recommend the place for some American style food for before or after a night out. Staff was really friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great selection and good food/service. Nice selection and the happy hour draft list looked great as well."}
{"text":"I love shady grove. I have great service here every time and I have never waited to be seated even when they are relatively busy. The portions are very large and consistently good. Highly recommend the sweet potato tater tots, or the pizza because the dough is fairly unique. Salads are also a favorite, and they have good specials! I believe Wednesday is half priced bottles of wine. There is something for everyone on their extensive menu, and it's also good for a date night. American food with a twist. I will be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Girls night out...out and about in shadyside..  Sunday evening.  We decided on \"Shady Grove\" and so happy on our choice. The food and service was excellent.  We only had to wait for a few minutes to be seated.  A table opened up outside.  Our server \"Liz\" was on it.. she was on top of our cocktails and food.  For appetizers we had Cajun rub wings:  which were good cooked well done as I like it.. but tasted like seasoned salt and paprika or chili powder..  there wasn't much to the cajun flavoring..  - was \"ok\".  I had wished  I had tried the hot.. wondered how that flavor was.   Mango Salsa:  how refreshing and flavorful!  Choice of pita/chips or both.. we decided to live on the edge and chose both!!  
I really liked the menu.  There was something for everyone..  and especially liked the added \"sunny side up - egg\" options on some of the dishes.  I had a tough time deciding .. there was plenty of options of sandwiches/wraps and even pizza.  I decided on the \"steakhouse burger\" and it was A M A Z I N G .. definitely one of the best burgers that I have had in the burg:  angus burger, smoked gouda, sauteed spinach, onion straws, bacon, lettuce and tomato $11.00 - definitely worth it.    Parking was tough but with some patience we managed to find a spot in the public parking lots a street behind walnut.  

Thanks Shady Grove!"}
{"text":"We had the 1/2 off burgers last night. Great burgers. Good atmosphere. Nice staff. They left the main door open (even we asked them to close) and the room was freezing cold which made us rush our meal."}
{"text":"They may or may have not given me a cheap vodka when I asked for a grey goose martini."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations food-wise. I got the turkey burger and switched the fries for a side salad ($2 extra). Most places are stingy with the side salads, so I wasn't expecting much, but the waitress brought me a plate where the lettuce was practically overtaking the already large burger. Needless to say, it was a wise substitution. Even better, we went during happy hour (Monday's 5-10) so burgers were half off. For all you broke college kids, that's $5 a burger. 

On the downside, they must compensate for happy hour by staffing the least charming waitresses on Monday nights. The girl serving us did everything right, but it was clear she was doing it out of obligation. I don't know if this bothers everyone, but it made dinner a little uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a cocktail in Shadyside. Great happy hours."}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go to drink or eat. The food is alright but the atmosphere is better. Monday's are half priced burgers which is a pretty good deal to go to but the service is hit or miss. Sometimes it's great sometimes it's terrible, but it hasn't stopped me from going back again and again. 

Update - their brunch menu is like a joke because half the items are available on the regular menu and just have eggs on them always. $4 mimosas on Sunday but other than that would not recommend as a brunch spot."}
{"text":"The Swiss bacon melt cheese burger was really good! Cooked to my liking. Atmosphere was really nice as well."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is bashed so much for the service.  I really have no qualms! Been there twice- although never on a night with drink specials (thank god). I prefer going for lunch as their sandwiches and salads are awesome.  Not to mention some of the tastiest french fries around.  Reasonably priced, tasty food with the caveat of going for lunch service only.  Not shabby."}
{"text":"Met friends here to catch up.  Was quickly seated on a weeknight.  Parked in the local garage, which was a 1/2 block away.  Immediately asked about drinks, then left alone for a very long time.  When the rest of my party arrived, we ordered. I had the half-off (happy hour) jalapeno popper dip with pita and chips.  The dip was good (jalapenos, cream cheese, breading topping), but very salty (and I love salt), as where the chips.  I couldn't finish it because of that, and probably downed about 2-3 glasses of water. I ordered a chicken sandwich with bacon, cheese, and apple (I can't recall the name).  My chicken was cold and a bit pink in the middle. I pulled it off and ate the rest, which was also super salty from the bacon. I did enjoy the sweet potato tots, which were crisp on the outside and hot on the inside. After 2 more glasses of water from the bacon saltiness, I had to find the restrooms.  The bathrooms were upstairs, and we had to weave between tightly packed people both downstairs and upstairs to get there.  All-in-all, this place was OK, I'd be willing to visit again, as I spent about $20 total for my over-salted food."}
{"text":"1/2 off wine nights on wednesdays! Be warned the wine bottles are $40-44. Amazing fries!!!"}
{"text":"This is a place I have been many times in college meeting friends for dinner and drinks. I have not been back in a long time and was pleasantly surprised at how great our dinner was.  We were seated quickly downstairs (it does get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights) and our friendly waitress took our drink order. They typically have a nice draft list and I went with my favorite the Leinie cranberry/ginger. The menu had so many great options from salads to wraps and burgers.  The salad options were so impressive and I went with the Greek salad which was served in a huge salad bowl. The dressing was delicious- what I liked is the dressing was not too oily and came with olives, feta cheese, cucumbers, onions and banana peppers.  Lot of fresh ingredients with a great taste.  My friend went with one of the wraps and I really like how you have an option of a few sides instead of getting fries."}
{"text":"Awesome thin crust pizza - Marguerita is my fav - also try the shrimp tacos! Good beers too. Some of the servers are a little Tri-Delt for my taste (one of the regular servers in particular has attitude to the max), but most are friendly. Also really good salads... I never say that :-)"}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this place as a bar, that sometimes I eat at.

Rather than a restaurant, that I happen to have some drinks at....

Using this lens - this place is pretty good.  Specifically - the pizza is very good.  Shady sticks as an appetizer - also great.  (think pokey sticks if you went to penn state and ever ordered from Gumby's)

I was there again this past Sunday and had a Greek salad.  It exceeded my expectations.  I've been many times over the past year, and I believe they've made some improvements to their salad options.  I was pleased!  

I haven't had the burgers or sandwiches lately, so won't comment on their flavor - but their menu is extensive - so there are many many options.  (Again, compared to a BAR - not another restaurant)

Wednesday night is wine night - half off bottles of wine.  Which is a wonderful headache inducing special.  

The place is usually packed after 7pm - every night.  Little room to move, no seats, etc.  And yes - there are a fare number of Ed Hardy and Affliction shirts.  I'm only giving this a 3 star, because the atmosphere and service drive me nuts sometimes.  Food and drinks alone, would warrant a better review.

If you're not interested in the mayhem...try them out for a weekend lunch.  A great stop if doing some Walnut Street shopping."}
{"text":"This is a great casual place to grab a drink and some food with friends. It's not incredibly unique, but that's probably where the charm lies: comfort food. Wednesday wine nights are the most rowdy it gets here, with the doors open for customers to walk upstairs to Up Kitchen where they've set up a DJ. Half priced bottles- best if you arrive earlier than you think you should."}
{"text":"Just as I was leaving Pittsburgh, I finally tried this place a couple days. I came here with a large group both times. You can't beat the deals like $4 wines or $5 ciders/beers. Tuesday is happy hour specials all day, yes, ALL DAY. The jalapeño popper dip is amazing! I originally tried the spinach & artichoke dip which wasn't that great but I discovered the jalapeño dip. The waitresses and hostesses were super accommodating and chill with both of the large groups I was apart of. Looking for a good bite to eat, affordable drinks, and cool scenery? Look no further than Shady Grove!"}
{"text":"A pretty good place to stop in for bar food on Walnut Street. They gave good drink specials (1/2 bottles of wine Wednesdays and some Fridays) and the food is average. I'm not a huge fan of the crowd that stops in on a night out, but I would probably come back for dinner sometime."}
{"text":"Good low-key bar just off of Walnut, but the food is greasy as all get out. Go here for a beer with friends, but not for dinner. They have some outside alley/sidewalk seating in the summer which can be nice."}
{"text":"Ha!

I'll get on the 3 starts bandwagon... even though I enjoy my times here.  If's a fun crowd, and beyond that, much much more.  Beer and food are fine, noting special!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for some drinks for a friend's going away celebration. I didn't order food so this review is only for the bar service. If you're a rookie like I was, the address indicates that it's on Walnut but the entrance is actually on a street off of Walnut. Bellefonte Street to be exact. And when you enter the first door, you have two options: go through the door immediately to the right or go upstairs to the left. Apparently the upstairs bar becomes quite the party with a live DJ on the weekends. 

My large party celebrated in the upstairs bar. You can also get food upstairs but note that the kitchen closes at 10 pm. Shady Grove does not take dinner reservations so our large group was scattered at different tables, as there weren't enough tables to fill us all. I opted to sit at the bar and got to see and hear the wait staff and bartenders interacting with each other. I can understand the frustrations of serving such a huge group, but I didn't really appreciate the permanent scowls on the employees' faces. I also didn't quite appreciate the tone they used when talking about our party to each other. Maybe they forgot I wasn't a part of that party but these kinds of conversations shouldn't be held in front of any customer. 

All in all, I wasn't a huge fan. The service kind of turned me off from anything else it might have going for itself. It's unlikely I'll come back for drinks and possibly never for the food either."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place, and this is my first time eating here. We came for our friend's 21st which also happened to be on Easter.
So we tried to order waffle fries, which were out... this restaurant is known for those aren't they?! And then there weren't any tortillas because we had tried to order chicken nachos for the table. Oh and then they didn't have PINEAPPLES for our pineapple pizza? Uh... and then no pierogis for the pierogi pizza.. 

Sighhhh.... well onto the food, when my friends' burgers came out, the smell was mouthwatering! And the fries were crispy! If I come again, I'd probably get the shady burger.
I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza. It wasn't too sweet! I liked it. We had also ordered the shroom pizza, way too cheesy for my taste, but it also had 3 different cheeses. They were both $12 for small pizzas, but there were like 6 slices and I had only finished half. 

As for service, our waitress Olivia, was really nice.  However she didn't refill our waters.... only once. And the service was quite slow. We spent two hours here.  Debating on returning again, maybe for the bar instead?"}
{"text":"My friends and I go to Shady Grove very often. We are able to meet for a great meal, or to meet up for a evening drink. The bar staff is great, show them respect and they will keep an eye out for you. Most of their wait staff are friendly and attentive.

Late Friday and Saturday the bar becomes standing room only and can become loud. But if you are looking for a nice place with good food, nice staff, and tasty drinks stop in."}
{"text":"I had the Pesto Burger and it was great. The service was alright. It's definitely more of a bar atmosphere, and of course since its in Shadyside, it's a pretty hipster-y place. I definitely want to go back to try the gourmet pizzas."}
{"text":"One of my favorite locations in Shadyside! With a variety of happy hour options throughout the week and a menu that has something for everyone, it's a must-try if you find yourself in this neighborhood. Plus, two-levels of seating and outside seating provides a wide range of ambience for your choosing. I've had many menu items, but my go to appetizer is the fried green tomatoes and the Bloomfield pizza is to die for as an entree!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday. It was pretty good and we waited 20 minutes to get a seat, and then like 20-30 mins to get our food. I would recommend trying out some of their deals, like half off burgers some days."}
{"text":"I often eat at this restaurant, mostly for convenience but also for price. I keep coming back because the drink prices are reasonable,  food is tasty, and the ambience is relaxed. 

The food menu is a bit large which can be somewhat cumbersome. Although they offer a lot to choose from, impressively, most of what they offer is quite delicious. Some personal favorites are the Cobb salad and fried green tomatoes. Ticket time seems very efficient for kitchens size. 

They don't offer too much space but do have outdoor seating for the warmer months. There's also additional seating upstairs. Seems to be a great spot for couples and small groups. The service is okay, at times not as quick as I'd prefer. Often feels like I have to coax somebody for attention instead of them anticipating my needs or checking back. 

There are many sites to choose from in Shadyside but I'd grab a seat here if you want fresh, unique food pairings that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Great place.  Went first time in July.  Loved the open atmosphere, sports on tv, trendy music and excellent food.  Try the nachos!!!  So much food we couldn't eat it all but I will go back for more.  Service was also very good."}
{"text":"Amidst all that hipness of Shadyside, full of overpriced and not-so-good food, Shady Grove was a surprise. They have a great variety for well-served sandwiches and snacks, and the place is usually packed. Great to bring your date or group of friends. Service there was really good as well."}
{"text":"Great place for a variety of foods! Salads are huge and fresh, burgers are always super juicy and yummy, but the best thing on the menu is the sweet potato tots. Those things are literally in my dreams some nights!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice, mainly for the half price wine bottles which is why I even came back a second time. The food here taste store bought, not quality at all. The first time I went for a wine night and it was hot so I had an ice cream sandwich. I don't know how an ice cream sandwich can be terrible but it was. It tasted like they went to their local grocery freezer section, grabbed the cheapest box of ice cream sandwiches and threw one on a plate. 

Then this past weekend I ordered the hummus. Worst hummus I ever tasted in my life, like it came straight from a grocery store. It was runny and overall tasted like something you buy in bulk at Sam's Club. I'll probably be back again for the wine, I just know to eat before I get there."}
{"text":"Really cool place. Both upstairs and downstairs have a full bar. Wine is half priced bottles on Fridays and they have other specials every night of the week. The menu was big with a lot of unique appetizers and probably the biggest salad selection I've seen lately. I also liked how almost all of the sandwiches could be served on brioche or a wrap. My friend got the chicken florentine on brioche with  fries and I had the FGBLT (fried green tomatoes) with sweet potato tots. Everything was delicious and the sandwiches are big so we only ate half and took the rest to go. We shared our fries and tots and agreed that the fries were good but the tots were SO good you could tell they were homemade. They were almost more circular shaped than normal tots and they came with some sort of zesty ranch type dipping sauce that went perfect. The ambiance was dark and cool for a date night or girls night out like we did! I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Some friends and I stopped here so we could sit outside, have a couple drinks, and relax.  This place met those needs.  We didn't try any of the food, beyond the fruit cup that my friend had and enjoyed.  The drinks were well made, the service was okay, and the seating was fine.  I'd go back to try the food, but nothing to go out of the way for."}
{"text":"So I've been wanting to go here for a long time after hearing multiple friends tell me that it's a fun place to grab a bite to eat. Last evening my friends and the mother of one of the girls I was with were in the neighborhood, so we decided to stop in and see if they were still serving food. 

There was a sign out that said \"please seat yourself\" and two gentleman manning the door. Given the two men monitoring the door and the late hour we imagined the kitchen might be closed and that it was drinks only (although people were inside eating, so we were on a he fence). So we asked the one guy if we would need IDs to get in (we are only 20 yrs old), and he said yes. That was fine, no problem, we would leave since we are not yet 21.  We turned around to leave and the guy hollered, \"haha yeah, go back to your little house party, ladies,\" at us in a very rude and snarky tone. 

We were all appalled by this employee's uncalled for outcry, but decided to ignore the jab. However, his condescending attitude is enough for me to never want to go back and try to eat there again. While I cannot say anything about the food, I had a terrible first impression of Shitty Grove and I hope that the rest of the staff is kinder than that young grump."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, with a nice covered outdoor patio.  Solid well-priced food.  Chicken salad melt and platter good.  Seems like this would be a great spot on the nights when they have specials, ESP 1/2 priced bottles of wine.  Excellent friendly service, cute waitresses.  Fast.  Only observation, raised by another Yelper, was the smell of the trash bin on the far right side of the patio.  Only blessing, it is not hot or humid today. I think it's a good casual element to Shadyside."}
{"text":"good wraps, great pizzas. decent beer selection. awesome bartenders."}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with Shady Grove. I frequent this casual bar and restaurant at least once a month since I live very close. It just has a larger selection of a typical bar menu but the food is always good. I love to go to their  1/2 price \"Wine Night\" on Wednesdays, but the place is always way to crowded to get a table, good service or even hear what your friends are saying. I'd love it if they have more of a night scene for young professionals on the weekends, but unfortunately it just don't compare to the other bars on Walnut street."}
{"text":"I've visited Shady Grove a few times over the past few years and always have a pleasant experience! This weekend I went with a group of my girlfriends for my friends birthday. It was a Friday night and we had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated, which was fine with us since we were able to find seats at the bar while we waited! It was very busy but the bartender served us right away. I started with a cosmo, which was great! My other 2 friends had dirty martinis and they said theirs were great as well. 

We were seated after about 30-40 minutes of waiting and we had a great table for the 6 of us! Our waitress was nice but you could tell she was very busy and rushing around. We started with the hummus, I order every time I go! They give a lot of hummus compared to the pita they give you, so we always ask for extra pita. For my entree I got the summer salad which is one of my favorites! It has shrimp, goat cheese, mango salsa, and sunflower seeds. Others around the table got ahi tuna, Cobb salad, and wraps. Shady Grove is a great place to visit while in Shady Side for a meal that will always be yummy!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed experiences here but my recent visit was spectacular. They have a draft list with something for everyone and great daily specials as well as happy hour specials. There is more space than what it looks like too! It's a great place for a get together and they have so many options on their menu and large portion sizes."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ended up here on 'Date Night' - This was a date night a few weeks ago, so although the food was pretty good I don't remember what we had. It wasn't anything spectacular but we enjoyed. Decor is nice, the place is massive and our waitress was friendly. Just be careful! - Wines were on special that night and I somehow chose one that wasn't and it was like $13 a glass and the waitress didn't warn me or anything. I had two, my lady had 1, so between that and our food we spent close to $100. Didn't plan on it."}
{"text":"Salads are my staple at this spot and they are HUGE! 1/2 price wine bottles on Wednesday and Friday make drinking here affordable. Upstairs gets a little \"clubby\" when they have a DJ, but much classier than most southside bars."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Typical American grill food done safe so dont come here expecting too much. Its better to think of food at this place as secondary to the drinks.

This place is a good meet up spot for drinks. You'll get a cool and casual feel here thats perfect on the weekends when you want to chill out with some friends. 

This place does get a little busy so dont expect to come with a big group and get a table immediately. There's half off bottles of wine on Wednesday which is awesome"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I have received great service each time. The food is great! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The wait times for a table can be a bit much, but by using NoWait you can hop into line and still do other stuff around Shadyside."}
{"text":"We had to wait for our iPhone to be fixed so we walked around the corner and found this little gemwe had dinner plans so my daughter and I decided to share   A pesto chicken wrap with onion rings. 
First bite is just simply WOW .. Flavor bursting everywhere.. Seriously the best wrap I have ever had.. And the onion ring amazing. 5 stars without any hesitation. Great service and amazing food. Thank you"}
{"text":"Service isn't great, but the food is above average and the atmosphere is welcoming. I like the sweet potato tots. Wednesday night is half off bottles of wine, but it gets packed."}
{"text":"I stop here for a glass of wine or beer when I'm leaving Journeys across the street. Nice outdoor seating. Service has always been good. 

Food is okay. Not bad, not great, just okay. The hummus is good, but needs more pita for what is served. We asked for more pita and they upcharged us 50 cents...which is fine, but just add 50 cents to the price and give me more pita to start. 

I've had other appetizers and salads here, but nothing memorable. I wish that it was because I do like the atmosphere and outdoor seating, but it just doesn't leave an impression."}
{"text":"Last night I had the summer salad and it was amazing!!! Excellent service, and not to mention the 1/2 priced bottles of wine were amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and each time I walked away very happy.  The food is decently healthy; my second trip was with a friend with a specific diet so she won't get sick and it was such a great option - and the price is just perfect! I got a wrap with fries and she got a wrap with a salad.  I'm not a super fan of the fries because they are a tad greasy (but if you like your fries that way, then this is the place!), I think next time I'll go for a salad instead.

My dad ordered the Cobb Salad and enjoyed it - it was a very large portion.  Both times I ate here, I walked away with extra food for another day's meal.  Heating it up didn't ruin it either.  I went with the General Tso's Chicken and Pesto Chicken - I'd recommend both!

Only negative was I felt I had to yell a lot to talk to my friend when we were seated close to the bar."}
{"text":"Three of my favorite things about Shady Grove: wine night on Wednesdays, their delicious sweet potato tater tots, and the salads served in mixing bowls.

I love meeting friends for lunch here because I love their salad choices. The Cobb is my favorite, but I really like the Southwest as well, and the strawberry salad in the summer.

I love sitting outside during spring, summer, or fall. It's quite lovely to be close to the hustle and bustle of Shadyside, but not too close."}
{"text":"Went out to eat here with a friend the other night.  First thing, this place is extremely vegetarian friendly, but not in an overtly \"I love growing my own vegetables and using vegetable oil to fuel my Prius\" sort of way.  Still plenty of options for carnivores.  

I ended up ordering nachos with mango salsa to start and a southwestern salad for the the main course.  The mango salsa was great, I just wish they served more seeing as the ratio of chips to salsa was kind of lop-sided.  

The southwestern salad was fantastic.  With a healthy dose of black beans avocado and this tangy vinaigrette type dressing which definitely hit the spot, I became an instant fan.  I'm usually not the type to order salads, but my friend warned me in advance of the serving size, and she wasn't lying.  They literally serve these salads in deep stainless steel bowls.  The appearance is kind of raw, but my taste buds don't lie.  

Overall our experience was good, though I wish the service was a bit more prompt.  Having to wait an eternity for the check was kind of painful.  Otherwise, I'd easily give this place 4 stars.  Regardless, I'll be back in the near future to check out some of the other offerings on the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch. We had French Dip wrap which consisted of sliced ribeye cooked in just enough fat to make it tasty with a great flavored au jus.
Tomato cheese soup which was quite good.
Onion rings which seemed pretty ok
Pulled pork on Kaiser Roll which was sweet sauced but not overly heavy which allowed the taste of the pork to shine through.
Coffee which was very good and moderately dark.

All in all very good service and a great meal."}
{"text":"This dining experience was lousy(company excluded), and a reminder to me that I should always trust my sushi instincts.  If Shady Grove is the best that  Walnut Street has to offer as far as drinking and dining, then it's no wonder that Shadyside needs a boost of steroids.  Perhaps, Barry shouldn't have been so quick to leave the Burgh or he should have left some of his good stuff behind.  My friend and I decided to order some of their artisan pizzas, and the Margharita and the Pesto were our choices.  The  honey wheat dough tasted like it came directly from the nearest Taco Bell caramel apple empenada assembly line.  The mutilated tomato bits strewn across each of the pizzas also must have come from a Taco Bell assembly line. Most of the items that should have been on the pizza were MIA.  When I asked our server about it, her expression was as empty as the street outside, which i thought would be jam packed with shoppers considering it was the Sidewalk Sale Event."}
{"text":"Stopped in again a few weekends ago on a Sunday evening during a Steeler game.  Service was MUCH better than the first time and our food was excellent. I got one of their million chicken wraps and Bobby got a shrimp wrap as well.  Their sweet potato tots and fries were to die for. This place is right up my alley - reasonably priced for delicious, large portions and a very extensive menu so you can pick whatever you may be in the mood for at that particular time.  Plus, they have good drink specials."}
{"text":"Not a good first experience at all. I walked in on a slow Friday afternoon. I was not greeted by ANYONE at all upon entering (mind you there was bartenders standing around idle) and no one spoke to me. Next, I sat there for a good 5 minutes which felt like 10, and had to ask a bartender for a menu to even get any sort of service. Anywho, the bartender wasn't too thrilled to serve me for whatever reason. For my first visit I'd rate customer service a solid 1 star.

Next, the food. I ordered my food which was not good at all. I had a half cooked buffalo chicken pizza. It was not thoroughly cooked at all. My stomach was in utter pain after consuming one slice! The dough was not thoroughly cooked and nor was the cheese. I wasn't impressed. I will not return here. I only recommend this place for a quick fast food option or somewhere to go on a drunk Saturday night.. nothing else!"}
{"text":"I went here with a group and one person who swore it was great. So nice! A great atmosphere. Adorable sign. Lovely weather outside. End of story. 
Too much fried stuff. I'd say if u got anything make it the catfish because at least u get some veggies. 
Other than that - skip it. ."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in shady side, pittsburgh. It's perfect for a sunny day brunch as well as a gloomy wine night. Wednesday's they have half off on a bottle of wine and their DJ is phenomenal. The section upstairs turns into a lounge. Perfect way to end a crappy study week."}
{"text":"Gotta love Shady Grove. Bellefonte, two story bar with an extension in the making. Downstairs is more casual and sports bar like, the upstairs is cocktail bar  classy. Additionally there is outdoor seating, perfect for warm summer and cool fall days. 

The menu is standard wraps and salad, a few appetizers and great bars. Wednesday and Friday is their half-off bottle of wine specials, Wednesday, Friday and soon to be Saturday they have a DJ spinning to make this location the only dance floor in Shadyside. 

Always a favorite. Come soon, come often"}
{"text":"The drink specials are good. The atmosphere and decoration is awesome.

The service B-L-O-W-S. Our server was exceptionally horrible. Who takes away someones empty beer in the middle of the meal and doesn't ask if they want another? Thought she'd just come back with one but instead she didn't come back. Had to flag her down to get a bill and go find her to cash out. I'd like to go back to the downstairs and sit at the bar to eat and see if the service can be better because I really wanted this one to be good. Oh yeah, and the upstairs really smells bad. Did anyone else notice that one?"}
{"text":"Although some others have listed Shady Grove as a bit mediocre I believe it is a pretty cool place.

Atmosphere:
There are lots of big screen tvs and usually plenty of seating if you don't go during happy hour or high noon you should be okay.  I've eaten their with my folks during the day and the service has been quite fast.  I've also eaten with a large group of friends during a hockey game which took a bit longer but still was expected with a large group.  The late night scene is enjoyable.  Lots of college and graduate students and a large batch of 25yr+ people.  There is an open bar and drinks are fairly large.  Shots are quite large, coke and rums are good.  I am not sure if there is a special drink offered but I've always enjoyed myself there at night no matter what I drink.

Staff:
The staff is pretty prompt.  It is quite a large place so sometimes if you are with a larger group you have to expect it to take a bit longer.  Sometimes I've been a bit surprised at how fast the food has come out though so you never know.

Food:
I think that the food here is good.  I would put some of the dishes on the same level as Cappy's down the street but others are outstanding.  I've had salads, quesadillas, burgers, wings, chicken finger platters, etc.  They have a great selection so if you are wish a group of people who are in the mood for a wide variety of foods it is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Big bar that seats around 20, and many tables inside,outside. Upstairs is more like a cocktail lounge and is closed off during the day. About 8 tvs inside. Dartboard upstairs as is the only one. It's a sports bar but is clean and the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Shady Grove is a nice location, and I've been here on multiple occasions, mostly for their half off wine night on Wednesdays and Fridays. It can get pretty busy in here on those nights, and its generally a good place to meet people. I've had the food too a few times, and the menu is not bad - typical American fare. I've had mixed experiences with the service at the bar though. The doorman is a really great guy, and over my multiple trips had a very friendly acquaintance with him. Upstairs though, depending on the bartender, I've sometimes had the feeling of being deliberately ignored, while someone else just cleans the glasses. This is not the case always by any means, but it left me with a bad impression for some time. Its never happened downstairs though, and typically most of the staff is OK. In general though, its one of the fun places to go on Walnut Street."}
{"text":"A Shadyside staple, this place is great for lunch while shopping Walnut, dinner, or late night. Last night my friends and I stopped here and it was at it's usual capacity, upstairs and downstairs, with decent music playing. It's a good local bar, nothing too crazy going on, and good for a final stop before heading home."}
{"text":"things white people like: shadyside.

things THIS white guy likes: sitting outside with jenn g. during the summer months and drinking in shadyside.

shady grove is exactly what the rating says \"a-ok.\" its a great place during the afternoon to sit outside and have a drink, but once the sun goes down it gets a little bro-y.

i never thought about it before, but i guess bro's are kind of like werewolves."}
{"text":"You had me at tater tots, but then you had to one up that and make them out of sweet potatoes.  I think I may love you now.  You have filled a void I didn't even know I had.

We arrived during a lunch time rush but were seated immediately and we didn't have to wait a minute for the waitress to come over.  With our drink orders placed we decided to read over the menu and then make our selections.  We started with the Shady Sticks and were happy with those.  All they are is a pizza with the sauce on the side for dipping.  I mean it's like a medium sized pizza, so a very good portion and the dough was so sweet and mixed with the three types of cheese on it was great.  For my main course I opted for the California BLT.  When I ordered this I was assuming that it was going to be run of the mill, thrown together BLT.  Was I ever surprised.  Multigrain bread topped with applewood bacon, crispy lettuce and thickly sliced tomatoes.  I was most surprised by the tomatoes, I was expecting uniformly cut and small.  What I got was like someone took a tomato from a basket, cut it quickly and didn't care how it looked, I approve!

Now, back to those tater tots!  I am completely infatuated with them.  They were crunchy and puffy and so delightful.  Just the right size to pop in your mouth and munch away.  Their side of Cajun ranch is an amazing compliment.  I was as near to heaven as I could be with those, no joke.

I also opted for the blackberry mojito.  Best way to describe it is by saying it was bittersweet.  The mint played off of the blackberry and it played well.

Seating was nice, at a high table, we were at the corner that we could not only people watch inside the restaurant, but we could also people watch on the sidewalk.  Televisions on, music blaring, people singing, it was a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed.  Bar was too loud and too crowded.  Wings were ok wings but not special.   I'm sure this appeals to the 20 sth crowd, but I'm not 20 sth anymore. :)"}
{"text":"Stopped while at UPMC. Only - was upstairs. Really good food. Very happy & nice waitress. Beer cold. Very comfortable, friendly, nice evening meal. Italian and more authentic."}
{"text":"Shady Grove is one of my favorite bars in Shadyside! Yes, it gets overly crowded but there is an upstairs and always a place to stand. Drinks are cheap there and I met a few people at this place. I would recommend this bar if you like a high class friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's a tiny bar/restaurant tucked off the main drag in Shadyside with great food and drinks and daily specials. It is not a larger establishment by any means so if you have a big party , i'd suggest elsewhere. 

We started out with the chicken nachos as an appetizer- they were huge, and delicious. Very good chili on them. 

My wife ordered the BBQ chicken pizza which she loved, I tried a small bite as I don't like onions but it was good- the crust is sweet, it has a distinct taste to it. 

I ordered the Shady Steak in wrap form and was blown away. It comes with potato latkes, egg, and garlic aioli and it was phenomenal, highly recommend. 

Service was really good as well. Aside from being a little crammed in and having to go upstairs for the bathroom, this place is a must visit"}
{"text":"Had the Prime Rib Salad with a maple cider vinaigrette!!!!!!
WOWZA!!!!!
It was great along with the prices and service"}
{"text":"i came here for taco tuesday, so I didn't have anything else besides their salsa fresca appetizer and their beef and chicken tacos.

much like PJ's pub, a small bar nestled between dorm buildings at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, MD, both places offered a pretty unauthentic selection of tacos for taco tuesdays.  i used to enjoy ordering 6-7 small tacos and a corona to wash them down. i was seeking the same experience here in pittsburgh.

the tacos are definitely a step up from those in that baltimore pub, but are also a tad more expensive. i was happy to have found a place hearby for cheap tacos, however, so I'll probably be coming back for those.

however, STAY AWAY from the salsa fresca appetizer. priced at 5 (or 6?) bucks, they throw an extremely bland version of their pico de gallo (made with at most 2 jalapeno slices), in a quantity no larger than half of a salsa container at chipotle, along a bed of chips (which actually weren't that bad...reminded me a bit of la salsa's chips (a mexican fast food restaurant chain in CA)).  this almost ruined the whole taco tuesday deal day for me.

i'll probably go back for taco tuesdays, simply due to location."}
{"text":"I found it a bit annoying to have to show my ID just to go in and have dinner here...

The food however was good.  I ended up getting some kind of spicy chicken wrap and I was pleasantly surprised to taste that it was actually spicy!

I've been here before just for going out and it can be fun.  I would say most people there are in their 20s and 30s and it tends to be crowded on weekends."}
{"text":"We had to wait for a table forever, they kept seating people ahead of us.  I asked to speak to a manager and she came over and said oh sorry and walked away.  The waitress gave us an attitude the whole time.  4 out of the 5 of us got our food at the same time. The 5 the person had to wait 10 more minutes.  The food was ok, lobster was cold and tasteless, fries were good.   Would not recommend.  First time and last time eating here!"}
{"text":"Shady Grove was always a favorite place to go after work for dinner or a weekend lunch break, when living and working on Fifth Avenue in Shadyside. The food and the service has always been excellent. I have never had a bad experience dining at Shady Grove. It is also a great place for a Sunday Brunch. I love the salads. My favorite is the Chicken Ceaser. I also like the Ahi Tuna. You can't beat a $3 Mimosa on a Sunday. 
They offer a small wine list, but I have enjoy a few glasses. I really like the 1/2 price wine Weds. They don't take reservations, but it does fill up quickly on a good day. Highly Recommend."}
{"text":"This place is consistently a solid 3 out of 5. That's more than most places can claim.  When it's crowded it's a 2 out of 5, because the bar is shaped a little strange since it gives the bartenders more room than the customers. The mixed drinks are a 4 out of 5 most of the time, depending on your bartender. The bar looks cool inside, and the location is right in the middle of Shadyside.  It's very close to the garage, so parking is easy if you can't find a street spot. The service is usually pretty good, except when it's really busy, which is understandable. This is a consistently good happy hour place that's close to home if you live in or around Shadyside. It is what it is, and it's pretty good at it most of the time.

In the summer when they set up the outside tables, this is one of the best places to hang out on Walnut as long as its not too crowded. 

Also - try the Ahi tuna appetizer, the Turkey Pesto Wrap, and the pizza after you've had a few."}
{"text":"Easy to get to (bus stop is less than a block away), good hearty food with a modern twist. A bit on the pricey side, but still good value. The Shady Grove Burger is a must! It gets really busy though so plan to wait a bit on Friday or Saturday evenings... The venue upstairs is nice and comfortable if you plan on hosting a larger group. They come highly recommended! :-)"}
{"text":"I rarely give restaurants a single star rating, and the thing is the food here is okay.

What i did not enjoy was being seated directly next to an outdoor dumpster, complete with garbage smell and flies everywhere.  Avoid the outdoor seating, bc just about EVERYTIME we go there, we get stuck sitting next ot the damn trash can.  

The hostesses always try to seat that table bc no one wants to sit there.  Its fucking disgusting.  We asked to be moved and the hostess was crappy about it and said that all the seats inside were full and that we would have to wait.

the last time we sat outside, our waitress took our drink order and then no one came out for like, 30 min.  then the waitress told us she forgot she was our waitress.  the trick is to eat inside, at the bar.  or avoid this place completely.

why the hell they cant move the dumpster is beyond me, but i get grossed out just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Been here quite a few times for lunch and dinner and never had a bad experience. Food is good, menu has a wide variety of choices, there's outdoor seating, and the prices are reasonable especially considering the amount of food you get. 

I've ever only gotten a beer with dinner so I can't really speak for the bar scene or what it's like after 9pm. Would recommend for lunch or dinner though."}
{"text":"I have never felt the desire to try Shady Grove based on the reviews, but I ended up coming here last week.  Apparently, Wednesday nights are half price wine bottle nights, but I just wanted food.

The happy hour chicken nachos ($6) were a good start for a group of four.  The portion was large and the nachos were pretty loaded.  However, I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap ($10).  I didn't enjoy it, as it was mostly just drenched in hot sauce.  I took half of it home and threw the untouched wrap away a week later.  My friends were equally unimpressed with the quality and the price.

I really have no desire to come back here, but I would at least consider ordering appetizers off of the happy hour menu.  Service was mediocre.  Otherwise, fairly unimpressed."}
{"text":"Yeah for a great lunch spot!  The salads are awesome!  I love when a restaurant has unusual salad combinations, not the usual Cesar, house and grilled chicken.  Boring!  I tried the veggie salad, which sounds basic, but wasnt.  It was huge and filled with yummy greens, broccoli, grilled portobellas and sunflower seeds.  I didnt need dressing bc there were so many yummy things included!  There were also some other great salads with goat cheese, eggs, avocados.  YUM!  My mother in law got some delicious looking artichoke spin dip and my sister in law got the tuna tacos, which looked amazing!  So much to choose from, I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Nothing Shady about the great service. Everyone was friendly and timely.  Great upscale bar food.  Servings are huge. Small pizza is something a family might share.  Great place."}
{"text":"As a whole, four stars but if going for happy hour or a daily special then Shady Grove deserves six (yeah, I know the max is five)!

Shady Grove is a nice place right in the heart of Shadyside. They have a great happy hour with beer and wine selections along with daily food/drink specials. Let me recommend going on a Monday evening after 5pm. Happy hour runs from 5-7pm and burgers are half price after 5pm! It is such an amazing deal! Staff always seems kind and the specials truly can't be beat!

I love Shady Grove's happy hour so much that I included it in a blog: https://www.nataliezazula.com/adventure/2017/12/1/shadyside-happy-hours"}
{"text":"Go here for lunch. The salads are fantastic (mine was topped with sweet potato tater tots, loads of grilled chicken and cheese. What's not to like?) The service, also fantastic and very quick. Atmosphere is a little grimy and you feel like you're eating at a bar."}
{"text":"Shady Grove is one of my favorite lunch or dinner spots in Shadyside. The menu offers lots of different options from appetizers, fresh salads, and mouth watering sandwiches and wraps all for an affordable price. (I highly recommend trying the Harvest Chicken or the Pierogi Sandwich for first timers.) I'm currently working on trying everything on the menu once, and so far no dish has disappointed me. From a friendly owner, great service, fun daily specials, and an amazing wine night every Wednesday (1/2 off bottles of wine until midnight) complete with an upbeat DJ upstairs, Shady Grove has become a regular visit for me and my friends. 
Keep it up Shady Grove!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places in Shadyside.  I have wanted to eat here for a long time and finally got the chance this past weekend.  I love the setup here with lots of indoor and outdoor seating.  Our server, Shidrokh was so nice and friendly.  She explained the best drink and food options for us.

For drinks my wife and I both tried the Adult Capri Suns.  I had the raspberry flavor and it was so good.  Great drink for a hot day.  My wife had the watermelon and liked hers as well.

On to the food.  Shady Grove has a lot of different options.  I wanted to try so many different things.  For an appetizer we had the buffalo chicken dip.  This was some of the best I have ever had.  While buffalo chicken dip is by no means a complicated dish, some places do it right and some places don't.  Theirs was a perfect amount of spice and sauce.  It also came with some really good grilled pitas.

For my meal I went with the Steak House Burger.  The burger was topped with sautéed spinach, bacon, onion straws, gouda cheese and a garlic aioli.  These toppings were very fresh and balanced out which made for a delicious flavor.  The beef itself was clearly fresh ground and had a great taste.  It was slightly over cooked for my medium rare request, however the burger was so juicy and flavorful it didn't really matter.  The burger came on a fresh brioche bun which held everything together.  The sandwiches and burgers come with waffle fries which were very crispy and had a great seasoning on them.  They also have some really good house made ranch which went perfect with the fries.

Can't wait to come back and try some of he other options on the menu."}
{"text":"Monday night is burger night and the fries are out of this world! If you have never been here, I strongly recommend going on a Monday to have a great meal at a crazy low price! 

I am more of a beer drinker myself but the man who tends bar is top notch; I would argue he is the best bartender in Shadyside. He makes fantastic drinks and is always doing cool bar tricks. 

I'm not a huge fan of the menu and to be honest I only ever eat here on burger night because its such a great deal. The service is very hit or miss depending on who's waiting tables. 

As for the weekends, Shady \"Groove\" is the spot to get your dance on. Go upstairs on a Saturday night and you'll find a bunch of people dancing in a judgement free zone. There's always good music bumping and the crowd is usually pretty tame, it's a great environment! 

If you go next door to Mario's, you will soon find that many of the loyal patrons mistake the bar for fight-club. Stay safe, avoid drama, and check out Shady Grove for a fun night out."}
{"text":"For lunch: Good pizza, sweet potato tots were a weird consistency like crunchy on the outside but then raw and undercooked on the inside. 

For night life: INCONSISTENT. going here to dance at night is fun but it's really hit or miss. sometimes it's crowded AF, sometimes it's pretty empty, sometimes the music is great, sometimes it's like wth is the Dj playing..."}
{"text":"Great place for some social drinking after hours.  You really cannot complain about a place that is packed with university students, drinks, and food.  It going to be an interesting night, anyway you look at it.  

So there are two parts to the this place, the downstairs bar and seating area.  If this area just seems to packed to find somewhere to sit, move along to the back and find the stairs that head up to the second bar area upstairs.  I spent most of my time upstairs where there was a jukebox blasting top 40's and hip hop.  The bartender actually made me put more money into the jukebox when the music stopped saying she was not going to serve until there were beats.

Well after some bar food and beers, the night was under way.  And the place stayed packed until closing.

Summary- $2 Dos Equis on Thursdays you have got to be kidding me!"}
{"text":"Great little dive, but trendy... Came to a local hospital to visit a friend and the misses needed to do a little shopping on walnut street. Stumbled across this little gem. My \"Shady\" burger was excellent. My wife's \"Capris\" sandwich was also excellent. Servers and bartenders were very attentive and busy... loved the local feel... we decided to eat at the bar and wasn't disappointed at all... place was clean... all the staff was friendly and competent, which is rare now a days. Enjoy"}
{"text":"We headed out for a walk yesterday with all intentions on making dinner at home. Normally when Bobby & I go on a walk, it's been on Centre Ave so we lately we've been switching it up and going on Walnut St. I always check livingpittsburgh.com for deals around the city and found out that Monday night is burger night at Shady Grove- half price burgers. 

It wasn't particularly busy, but i soon realized we JUST missed some burger festival right outside which was seeing who had the best burger in the area, so everyone must have ate while there. 

Anyways, their menu seemed really great. I loved their pizza menu and we may have to stop in to try one of those. The entire menu seemed tasty (esp the sweet potato tator tots) I decided on the Shady burger which was a large burger topped with american cheese, bacon, egg & usual toppings- lettuce, tomato, onion & pickle. It comes with a side of fries, but you can upgrade to waffle fries or tots for $1. As delicious as the tots sounded, i loooove waffle fries so that was my choice. My burger was tasty and piled high. 

I would have gave them 4 stars if the service was a tad better. Our server was a sweetie but everything took foreverrrrr- being greeted, our drinks after ordering, the food (which most likely wasn't her fault) It was just annoying waiting around to be waited on and for the drinks when as i mentioned earlier it wasn't overly busy. Also, after getting my food, my drink was empty the entire time. She walked by and looked right at it but never brought another one. 

Overall, we may stop back but will most likely sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Reasonable place for a drink and a bite to eat in the Walnut St. neighborhood. Outdoor seating is available when the weather allows. Beer menu is a bit limited but all in all, not much to complain or crow about."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Shady Grove in a while but was craving a salad from there this past weekend so decided to check it out again. I was very impressed with the quick, quality service. I was sat outdoors (my preferred seating arrangement) almost immediately and greeted by my waitress moments later. I wasn't in a rush but I also didn't want to spend all day there and my whole dining experience lasted about 30 minutes. I was so happy.

I ordered their BBQ Chicken Salad w/ Ranch Dressing, which I've had before and was craving. It was just as good as I remember and I ate almost all of it. I don't have any complaints :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Shadyside! Great specials and the staff are always nice! The menu has a great mix of simple and funky items so that everyone is happy! I adore their pizza but I've had their appetizers, wraps, burgers, and salads and enjoyed every item I've ever ordered! They serve some of the freshest salads in the city and I seriously couldn't rave more about that pizza! Definitely get the Bloomfield pizza and their bleu cheese dressing!"}
{"text":"I came here after an entire day of not eating, because I was traveling. I've never tasted better nachos in my entire life. I'm not sure if it was because I was so hungry, but I will stand by my statement saying that they are the best tasting nachos to grace my tastebuds. I also had a burger that was delicious. Can't remember what kind it was, but I was so full after gorging myself on nachos that I couldn't finish the large portions. As a poor college kid, Shady Grove is an awesome treat. I love it and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends last Dec.  We had the waffle fries with cheese and bacon and something else to munch on (I don't remember what the other food item we ordered was), and the food was okay.  For drinks, we opted for cocktails.  My friends both ordered caramel appletinis, and really enjoyed them.  My drink, on the other hand, was just weird tasting.  I don't remember what it was supposed to be (they don't have a drink menu on the website; otherwise I could probably figure it out), but I remember it just tasted off, to the point that I couldn't finish it (and that *never* happens with me with cocktails).  My friends both tasted it and agreed.

Service was on the slow side, but then again, it was happy hour, and they were understaffed.  It seemed like a fun spot to have a few drinks after work--the crowd seemed to be mostly young professionals--and they have a decent variety of food to choose from.  I wanted to like this place, and I'd go back and give it another try, but I was underwhelmed on my first visit.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Greg the bartender is the best!! If you stop In make sure you look for him!! And the food is always amazing. It always hits the spot"}
{"text":"My fiance and I were visiting Pittsburgh and wanted to try a local place.  We were in Shadyside, so we decided on Shady Grove.  The place was PERFECT.  We had Sunday lunch, got a pizza -- had the most AMAZING dough (almost sweet) and we had teh fish taco's which were also phenomenal.  I was NOT feeling well BEFORE I ate here, and afterwards I felt like a million bucks.  Would definitely reccommend for a local, clean, fresh meal! 

Oh -- I waitress Lauren was also SUPER nice!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing atmosphere. Pittsburgh salad is awesome! Wine night is amazing!"}
{"text":"I went to Shady Grove to break my fast and the hostess and the waitress (Chloe) were extremely friendly and understanding towards my friend and I! They gave me my Diablo burger quickly and it tasted extremely good! The cookie cake dessert was also delicious and really hit the spot. Would definitely come back. Also on mondays, burgers are half off which is a huge plus"}
{"text":"Went to ShadyGrove on Friday night for a quick bite to eat.  The food is just okay.  Well cooked but not really seasoned, so they should probably leave salt and pepper on every table as a standard.  I got the sweet potato tater tots.  The spicy ranch sauce that's served with it is pretty food, but the tots themselves have a weird texture.  Their waffle fries however are a winner.  My best suggestion is to go here for the ambience but not so much the food."}
{"text":"Very happy with our visit to Shady Grove! Came here on a Monday afternoon, 93 breezy and sunny, they had the perfect spot for us to sit outside and enjoy..
Corona, mahi mahi tacos, hummus dip, & ahi tuna salad were all excellent. Very laid back vibe, great service, and many options to choose from on the menu. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Monday's burger nights (~$5) is the best deal I've found in the city for the cost. Comes with fries, and $4 Jim Bean drinks makes for a solid meal in an up-scale, but relaxed atmosphere. Wine nights on Wednesday are great too with 1/2 price bottles. The bar staff is consistent and always keep a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food is good but nothing too special. Nice happy hour prices and drink selection. This is my go to place in Shadyside. It has a wide menu, so something for everyone. The pizza has a sweet crust, which I don't personally enjoy, but others love! The salads are huge! Overall, pretty good!"}
{"text":"Let me begin this by saying that the reason they are getting this rating is for lack of consistency. 
I was a shadyside resident for quite sometime and spent many afternoons and evenings in Shady Grove and Walnut Grill. Shady Grove has been the less consistent of the two for me over the years. For New Years Eve this year, my friends made dinner reservations for us at Walnut Grill and then we went downstairs for drinks and to ring in 2012. This review is only about Shady Grove, as my experiences at Walnut Grill have been pretty good. 

Shady grove food is good and the drinks are reasonably priced. The space is cool and in the summer they have outdoor seating, which I love. Wine nights on Wednesdays cannot be beat-half priced bottles all evening. The reason for the 3 rating? The service is SO inconsistent. I've had visits where my service is appalling, and then visits where my service is grand. When I say appalling, I mean a waitress poured water on my feet and all over the floor, and told me not to slip when I left, rather than giving me a towel to dry my freezing toes. And even on NYE, the service was very inconsistent. One bartender would be great. Another would be just awful-horrible attitude, ignoring sections of the bar, etc. It is really a shame. It seems like certain employees (in particular a broad fellow with dark hair-not wearing the uniform...perhaps a manager?) are there just to meet girls and act like a hot shot. He was behind the bar, not serving anyone, as if to give the impression that he owns the place (which I know he does not), and was hitting on a girl in my group HARD. He was just trying to look like a big shot. Annoying. Make a drink for the people waiting and stop trying to hook up with uninterested women. Thanks. 

That being said, it is usually a cool crowd there. Great location. Usually I have no trouble finding parking. So all in all...Good food. Good Vibe. Good  drinks. Some great servers. Some crabby servers. Big guy with the dark hair? Try to get laid on your own time. 
Happy New Year!"}
{"text":"Not only are the drinks good, but so is the food! I highly recommend Shazam shrimp for an appetizer! Just the right amount of crunch and spice! Even after it was over, it had me wanting more!

I also recommend the grilled shrimp tacos! Shrimp is fresh and seasoning tastes really good. I got the onion rings for a side and they were cooked just right! Not too burned, cooked the right amount and a good size.

For dessert we got the deep dish chocolate chip cookie. It was delicious! Just the right amount of chocolate and gooeyness! Only complaint is that I wish it was bigger lol!"}
{"text":"The soup was watery and the drink was weak. The cocktails here are not worth the money for such a weak pour."}
{"text":"Half price wine bottles Wednesdays.  Get the shady sticks.  Eat'em when they're still hot. 

Yum."}
{"text":"Stopped here recently with friends after work. We were seated quickly in the back of the restaurant and quickly ordered a bottle of wine. Wine was good but it was not cold enough. The spinach and artichoke dip we shared to start was delicious. Big pieces of artichoke and soft pita. I had the BBQ chicken salad. This salad was huge and pretty good. Lots of chicken, BBQ sauce, fried onions, and cheese over a huge bowl of iceberg lettuce. I'll be back. It was the prefect stop after a particularly bad day."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here in almost six years and the food was still amazing!!!!! Today I got the steak burger med rare on a ciabatta bun  The service was great and very calm for lunch time because I know how busy they can get"}
{"text":"Two words:  mango salsa.  

That is my entire review."}
{"text":"Being a Philly girl, living in Western Pa, has been difficult, but Shady Grove and their yummy menu has made life her bearable!!! The food, the service, the atmosphere....all top notch!"}
{"text":"Great veggie burger, delicious fries, AND they have outdoor seating so it's dog friendly. Great combo!"}
{"text":"We were told the wait time was 45mins for a table outside. But inspite of waiting for more than an hour I was told they can only give me a table inside. The waitress decided to give the table to her friends who just came."}
{"text":"This was a great place to get together with friends. Wouldn't recommend for a first date because it's pretty loud in there. The food was really good. I got the strawberry chicken salad and it was huge, I couldn't finish it all! My friend got the Diablo burger and it came with this really great spicy sauce that balanced the burger out. There was a lot on the menu, so I would definitely come back to try something else. 

I came on a wednesday night, so I had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table, but there's an open bar on the second floor so it wasn't too bad. Wednesdays were half off wine bottles which was probably why it was busy!"}
{"text":"Really nothing special to this place except the outside seating they have in the summer.  Recently came here, and my friend ordered a Coors Light draught (wimp i know), but it tasted absolutely awful.  Don't know if it was the keg that was bad or the hoses that hook up to the keg that need to be cleaned. 

Next I got a Turkey Rachel.  Probably one of the most flavorless sandwiches I've ever had.  The only thing I could really taste, was the rye bread it was on, which was quite good.  My friend got the veggie powerhouse salad.  He did seem to enjoy that.  I had a bite as well, and I will say, not bad.

Overall, service was super slow.  I don't think I'll be back for a meal anytime soon.  It's just too mediocre to waste your time, money, or calories here."}
{"text":"Fun place to have some drinks! Didn't have any food because we were there late night. Awesome staff! The friendly bartender saved my iPhone because my drunk ass left it behind. Very much appreciated!!!"}
{"text":"Great Wednesday wine night but otherwise service is not great. Today was a slow day but they wouldn't let my group combine tables to accommodate our large group. Happy hour prices are good and wines are half off which makes it great. Outside seating is nice in the warm weather though so I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Shady Grove in my college days, but just recently went back for a wine night. It's always a good vibe and the waitresses are friendly (more friendly than the hostesses that's for sure). Half price wine bottles on Wednesday's and other specials on different days. We got food this time. I ordered the shady sticks which are just cheese breadsticks. But honestly they weren't that good. They needed some garlic or something. It was just some cheese on bread with no type of seasoning. The bread also was oddly sweet which was kinda weird. My friend ordered wings which were just your basic wings nothing exciting. 

I recommend if you're looking for a cool vibe and upstairs dancing. And if you need food it's there just don't expect it to be great."}
{"text":"Jerk wings were fabulous!  Also had the strawberry, goat cheese and chicken salad... Also excellent!  Served in a stainless steel mixing bowl. HUGE! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Return? Not a destination spot but a good option if your in the area 
Atmosphere (3) - Standard bar vibe. Very busy when we were there
Food (3+) - french dip (3 - a little shy on roast beef, more bun), fries (4), Bloody Mary (4)
Service (3) Friendly
Cost = $58.24 after tax/before tip (included 2 other meals plus drinks)"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Shadyside. There is a huge menu with lots to choose from and whatever you pick is bound to be good. The French onion soup is to die for and they also broil cheese over their tomato soup. The staff is friendly and it's a nice atmosphere. I highly recommend stopping in for a drink and a bite if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Guys, this place will never leave your mind after coming here. I have only been here once, but it was just so comforting and memorable! First off, their fries are incredible - like some good ol' pub fries! So obviously a very important aspect. The prices aren't bad AT ALL in my opinion. The menu is different, but with familiar food! That's the best way I can explain it. I got the chicken Caesar wrap when I went (with fries, duh) and it was such a large portion and so delicious! I've been dying to stop here for brunch, or just really any other time, but I'm not super close by. Again, I've been here one time, but I can't stop thinking about how good it was!"}
{"text":"The food is not good
Weekends are very crowded
So mediocre."}
{"text":"Shady Grove has been a great place for me and my co-workers to come enjoy a working lunch or a bottle of half-priced wine. Today I ordered a salad to-go and it was bountiful and delicious! The Waldorf Salad is so satisfying with juicy bites chicken, big walnuts, and granny smith apples. Definitely recommended for lunch, take-out or relaxing after a long day."}
{"text":"I normally don't order the same thing every time I go to a restaurant, but Shady Grove is the exception. The Autumn salad is delicious-- the toppings are plentiful and definitely make the salad memorable (unlike a lot of restaurants). There is a plethora of fantastic appetizers on the menu; in fact, the buffalo chicken dip is the only food that makes me occasionally regret going vegetarian (sorry, not sorry). My food has always been fresh and delicious here! 

The wait normally isn't that bad, but my only complaint is how FREEZING cold it is in the \"waiting area\". There isn't very much that they can do about this, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Excellent. Best salad I ever had. It's called the Summer Salad. It has shrimp and mango salsa. They also have steamed dumplings as an appetizer. Great food."}
{"text":"Shady grove has always been one of my favorite places to go in Pittsburgh especially when I'm down on Walnut st. Their buffalo chicken dip is so good along with their French fries and ranch. Yum! I am also a big fan of their Pittsburgh chicken salad as well as their chicken florentine wrap. My friends rave about their pizza since the crust is made with sweet dough.. So you get a hint of sweetness with every bite. I only had one bad experience here a few years ago. My food came out pretty cold.. However, I told our waitress and she brought back a whole new plate. Other than that, this is a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner and drinks with coworkers after our shift (within easy walking distance from Shadyside Hospital). We shared the loaded latkes appetizer, which was delicious. For entrees, we ordered the fish tacos, a Caesar salad, and the Waldorf salad. The three tacos a single person can eat, but the salads come in large silver metal bowls and are really enough for two servings. All were delicious. There are large selective of beer and wine, as well as a few cocktails. I am finishing my excellent Wild Old Fashion as I type this. This place functions well as a restaurant-cum-bar."}
{"text":"Moving here from DC, maybe I just expect too much as far as service, but I feel like my expectations in this case are standard. 

Their food is delicious, there drinks are yummy, I have just been consistently disappointed by their service. Even if they are semi busy, the waitresses seem to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Though, the bartenders have their act together. 

I came here on Monday evening...around 6/630. I ordered the Fajita wrap...I took two bites, and then noticed there was a small brown hair in my fries. My hair is long and black, so clearly it wasn't mine. When I told the waitress, she very professionally exclaimed \"shit!\" and came over. 

I told her, I lost my appetite and just asked for a new order to go. I waited until my friend finished her meal, and then asked for the check. My waitress plopped mine down in front of me. Seriously? I ate human hair at your venue...and you're going to charge me for that? You've officially made my shit list."}
{"text":"For some reason, this place is always busy. I go here when I'm too tired to think of a place but still want to feel like I had lunch/dinner 'outside'. Large portions as is the norm, nice selection of drinks. I have tried a few burgers/sandwiches here (huge!)."}
{"text":"Holy hot cocktailers batman!! And gangster rap any time after 8 pm. And two dollar beers and half priced margaritas on Thursdays. My service has always been prompt and friendly. The food is indeed mediocre but beer is pretty hard to screw up. It just has to be cold, which it is. God Bless I say!"}
{"text":"Had the yak burger (excluded from the half-price burger offer on Mondays), and it was just okay - certainly not worth the $11 I'd paid for it.  The stuffed pepper soup was tasty and original, however, and the dinner salad was also decent.  Overall Shady Grove is respectable enough as a casual dining option, but there's nothing about it that would compel a return trip."}
{"text":"Food is solid, especially for a place whose main focus is on being a bar and a see-and-be-seen spot.  Pleasantly surprised by very good, prompt and friendly service.  

Wouldn't go here as a destination for a meal, but when you're on Walnut and aren't up for the usual bar fare or one of the more upscale places it's a good compromise with reliably decent to very good food."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to go for happy hour and I like the happy hour themes they have each day of the week.  My friends and I went for the Wednesday half off wine night and enjoyed a nice bottle of wine for cheap.  I also tried several of the appetizers and they were all tasty, good sized portions, and reasonably priced.  Nothing amazing, but all good.  Despite the place being packed the food came out quickly and the server was pretty attentive given how busy the place was."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go over in Shadyside. They a lot of different sandwiches and friendly staff. The chicken funguy sandwich is my go to! You have to try this play at sometime in your life."}
{"text":"Oh shady grove! I hadn't been here in ages, but was craving a solid salad and knew I couldn't go wrong here.  

There salads are HUGE and very filling.  I almost always get a pittsburgh salad (fake healthy), and shady grove does this well.  Waffle fries were delish, chicken was solid and their ranch is really good! 

This time around we got the surf and turf appetizer and it's not worth it.  Would not recommend this and docking a star for the inconsistency."}
{"text":"Drinks get an A+ for kind service adn great prices, the food ranks in at about a B/B-. I Had the ahi tuna for $9.. it was koay, and I give them props for having it on the menu as it's not typical bar food for Pittsburgh, but a very popular drinks accompaniment in Miami. If I return, I'll definitely go for the classic fried finger food. Had a few beers, each on draft for $1.42.. Awesome! The crowd filtered in for happy hour, and it was the most packed around 6. Overall, I'd do it again. Perhaps for a more formal seating in the upstairs restaurant, Walnut Grill. It seems to operate from the same kitchen and under the same management...  Since the great drink prices resonate as most memorable, I've added it to my \"Party in the 'Burgh\" list."}
{"text":"Arrived here for happy hour on a Tuesday. Specials - $3 drafts, $4 wines, and $6 mojitos from 5 to 7 pm. 

We ordered a few appetizers to share: chicken nachos ($11), mango salsa ($4) and grilled jerk shrimp ($5). The food was pretty good and a decent size. I especially loved the fresh jalapeños on the nachos and the convenience of the separate side cups of pico de gallo, sour cream and guacamole. The waitress was attentive and the noise level wasn't too bad. Unfortunately, my mojito was disappointing - very weak and fairly tasteless. 

Shady Grove is a good choice for a casual night out at a decent price. I'll be back to test out wine night - you can never go wrong with half price bottles (Wednesday and Friday)."}
{"text":"Went to Shady Grove this afternoon and sat at the bar for a quick lunch.  It was anything but!  I originally went to order one of their \"taters\" - a loaded baked potato and the server told me, sorry we don't have them and that we are in the process of changing the menu.  Thanks...then I waited 25 minutes for her to bring my second choice.  The BBQ chicken wrap was okay as far as nourishment is concerned.  I wouldn't go back.  It looks like a cute cafe from the outside but its clear this place is a bar, serving bar food with bar service and bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have a fashionable, attractive people social scene going on most weekend nights.  I believe Friday is usually their biggest night, last Fri, they had a great DJ spinning electronica and house mixed in with your typical top 40 crap at the upstairs bar which also has a small dance floor.  If you're into the best scene, good looking people, and some risk of phoniness.  Drink prices are reasonable given the crowd they're shooting for."}
{"text":"I have only been to Shady Grove twice when I am in the area and don't feel like breaking the bank. 

Both times I have ordered one of their sandwiches, the first time being a caprese wrap and the last time a chicken florentine sandwich. The Chicken Florentine was definitely the better of the two, though honestly I have not had a caprese as a sandwich that I like anywhere.

My favorite thing about this place is the $2 Mexican beers and $4 tequila shots. The tequila shots are for any tequila of your choice! Last time we were there my boyfriend and I threw back a couple of Patron Silvers. We only stopped because we had to go shopping for house stuff (being an adult sucks sometimes!). I usually go with Dos Equis, either the Lager or Amber, as my drink of choice. Can't beat tasty $2 beers."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice bar/pub style with outside seating. Staff is friendly but service is slow. I had dinner there alone at 6pm on a weekday and it took them 30 min to bring the incorrect order then another 5 min to correct it. I am visiting this area, but where I come from a Medium burger means pink in the middle. My late arriving burger was burned on the outside and cooked all the way thru.  Sweet potato tots were sweet and tasty. Overall, just okay. Nothing special. Probably would not come here again.  Lots of great restaurants to try."}
{"text":"Generous portions, popular place, flavorful entrees, good wait staff, something on the menu for everyone"}
{"text":"Decided to meet up with two friends here on Tuesday. We met at 6pm, which was perfect since it wasn't too busy yet (filled up by 7:30pm). We quickly had a table (opted for inside) and caught the second half of happy hour (5-7pm), which offered half price cocktails ($9-11 usually) and selected glasses of wine for $4. My two female friends were big fans of their Bellinis and I stuck with a Whiskey Mojito which was decent.

We started off with an appetizer of their dipsticks, which are pizza dough with spinach artichoke dip on top with ranch sauce for dipping. My friend has gotten them before and raved about them, however I thought they were just OK. Tuesday also brings the taco specials for $2. Last night's taco choices were either chicken or beef (I believe it changes each week). I stuck with chicken, which I thought were really good. Once we passed happy hour, we went with the Tuesday specials of $2 Mexican beers (Corona, XX, Pacifico). There were also $4 tequila shots, but we weren't going down that road.

Overall, I thought we got away with a great value and had a great time (about $15 each before tip for 3 hours). Our server Alex was great and I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal at this place. The service is great and the food is always right. I've been to a few places around town that can screw up an order pretty easily, don't offer customization on items and the price doesn't match the quality; but this joint does not fall under any of those categories. Also, their To-Go section is on point. Highly recommend the sweet potato tots with their ranch dressing. It's fire."}
{"text":"To be honest I think I might just come back on weekends for drinks because they're food did not make me feel too great afterwards. It is normal bar food I suppose, but I was hoping for better quality. I ordered with my friend the pesto pizza and their new sandwich with spinach and chicken with aioli and cheese. I felt like i gained a few pounds, but the pizza was a little bland and the sandwich mainly just tasted like spinach. Their fries are crispy and taste pretty good along with their tater tots that I had on my first visit."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and while it never disappoints, can't say that Shady Grove is anything tremendous. I will say that Happy Hour is a great time to grab some drinks here and maybe stop in for the daily food deal. My $5 tacos were definitely worth it! 

The beer selection is standard with a few craft beers on tap but mostly just your average Yuengling, Blue Moon and the sorts is what people go for."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed numerous experiences at Shady Grove. However, when I went there recently, it resulted in a horrible stomachache. I am not sure which of the dishes I got which were the thai shrimp tacos, summer salad, and The Goat pizza. I will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service upstairs is horrible. My husband and I have been up there three times with the same server and we have nothing good to say except the food is decent, but only when they put your order in properly. Twice we've been there and explicitly stated we're vegan and our food has come out with cheese after asking for our food without. Also, our server was eating dinner at the bar in front of guests while our drinks were sitting empty for twenty minutes. From now on, we will only go to drink when already intoxicated..."}
{"text":"I personally rarely come here specifically to eat. I do love to come here for the atmosphere/drinks/girls. Their waitresses are for the most part really hot!!!

The Food: personally I like the combo of onion soup and the shady burger (yea its not the best burger in town, but its got a great taste to it). Rest of their food is so-so, and some of it is down right awful, but again... i don't come here for the food.

The Atmosphere: LOVE the atmosphere!! There is outdoor seating, there are lots of windows, there is a jukebox upstairs, there is a fun bar area downstairs with lots of TV's so you can watch the game with buddies over some drinks. There are always very attractive people here.

Waitresses: really hot! really nice! great service!

This is def my favorite bar in shadyside, but again, I don't come here for the food! (except maybe the soup)."}
{"text":"Tasty. Not out of this world, but always satisfying! Would recommend their pizzas to anyone though. Such a good dough!"}
{"text":"Half portion of nachos available during happy hours, and still a huge plate. Grabbed their daily special last time, was a blue cheese buffalo hot dog (forgot the name). Very satisfying. Not 21 yet but will definitely return for half price cocktails this summer after my birthday."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a salad, prepare yourself to eat the whole garden. These veggie bowls are huge. 

I got the Pittsburgh salad complete with Waffle fries on my first visit. My second visit wasn't as healthy: Fried Green Tomatoes and the 'Shroom pizza. The tomatoes were spicey and super yummy, served on bed of mixed greens. 

Bread means a lot to me, so when this pizza aced the bread test, I was in love. The $11 dollars I paid for a small was more than worth it. 8 large slices that could have easily filled the tummies of three or more people. 

I also downed a couple of tequila sours with my meal. I have nothing but good things to say about every aspect of this place."}
{"text":"Sometimes I love this place, sometimes I cannot stand it. It depends on how busy they are and who is working. One time I had one of the best waitresses I've ever had. Another time I had a waitress I'm pretty sure was coked up. Meh. You never know.

The food, however, is always decent bar food. I really the shady sticks and the \"pretzel.\" I like the appetizers in general. I love their bloody marys. Good burgers. Large salads. Lots of add-on options for any sandwich, salad, burger, etc.

Over-priced cocktails, but decent specials. Good beer choice usually. All in all, it's a decent place. I take friends here who are visiting from elsewhere because it's close to my apartment and had something to offer everyone."}
{"text":"Some places you just go to for the outdoor seating. 

As a vegan you have to take the good with the bad. Not that this place is \"bad\" per se, but there are few options. And very few that are healthy at that. 

Service was friendly and pretty quick - the bottled beer my husband chose was expired by a few months - whoops!

Great, quick-ish, place to meet up with friends after work on a nice day out and midweek there was a lot of outdoor seating to choose from. 

Typical \"hummus & dip type offerings for the vegan lot."}
{"text":"Typical bar food. Good burgers. 

It gets extremely crowded on Wednesday evenings for half-price wine night. Be wary. If you're going for food on a Wed, show up by 6:30. Otherwise you'll never get a table."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my sister 2 weekends ago and it absolutely hit the spot! The menu has so many incredible options I could not decide, but finally went with the Chicken Florentine Sandwich and it was absolutely perfect! I opted for the sweet potato tots which were very good but maybe not as great as the hype led them to be. Still the service was excellent and my sandwich tasted as great as it sounded and was a terrific portion."}
{"text":"One word: AMAZING! Shady Grove did not disappoint with the happy hour specials today. Our server was an awesome IUP grad like myself and was very helpful! 

My chicken nachos were surprisingly flavorful topped with beans, cheese, onions, salsa, sour cream and guacamole, all for $6! My girlfriend ordered the Pittsburgh chicken salad and was the best in town!

I can't possibly say more about Shady Grove. Stop in and find out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Shadygrove for half off burgers almost every Monday, it's a great deal! Burgers usually come out to around $5 and drafts are around $3. I've had the Shady Grove Burger about 5 times. Quality is a bit inconsistent (can be overcooked sometimes) but is still delicious. Also this place has the best fries I have ever had - crispy outside and soft inside. Only once were the fries done badly (fried in old oil). Wednesday wine night is also fun and has great music! A lot of 90s hip hop. It does get very loud in the upstairs area, so don't expect to have any intimate conversations. They do get busy, so be prepared to wait a bit. Also, skip the tacos, blech. :P"}
{"text":"The restaurant was fairly good. The menu is extensive. The food is delightful. The wine list is also impressive. The ambience really makes this place memorable. Whether you want to watch a sporting event or simply enjoy a nice, semi-casual night out--Shady Grove is your spot. The feel is young, contemporary professional rather than rowdy bar or stuffy lounge. If you want to unwind and have a decent time on a weeknight or weekend, this is the place to be; however, it may be too loud for some to enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night and was seated right away. The interior is cute with decorative trees around with lights. We started off with the fried pickles. They were nice and tangy and tasted great with the horseradish sauce. For dinner, I had the southern fried chicken sandwich. The sandwich was huge. I was disappointed that it was not one chicken breast or patty but rather four chicken tenders. This made the sandwich quite difficult to eat. Tenders just kept falling out. The hot sauce was good and added nice flavor, but I ended up just eating some of the tenders on their own. I had ordered waffle fries, but it came with fries. The fries were fine. I could not even finish them, because the food just felt very greasy. My friends had the veggie burger and enjoyed it, but their patties kept falling apart too. Overall, Shady Grove is hit or miss with their dishes."}
{"text":"Wanted to go somewhere I hadn't been before and realized that despite always passing it I have never been.  So I went, and it looked promising from the outside.  Our waitress was attentive and people seemed to be enjoying themselves.  I ordered the Jerk Mahi Mahi on Kaiser and my fiancee ordered the Caprese Sandwich.  This is where things started to fall apart.  
My sandwich came on a hamburger bun, not a Kaiser roll and the fish was mediocre to decent, nothing to write home about, but the jerk rub was not nearly as spicy as a jerk rub should be.  On the menu the Caprese Sandwich is vegetarian and says \"Add chicken $3.\"  The sandwich came with chicken which we did not order, when we asked the waitress she said that it automatically comes with chicken (and therefore also comes automatically for $11 instead of $8), if we didn't want chicken we had to ask to have the sandwich come as it says it does on the menu.  If it automatically comes with chicken, then say that on the menu and charge $11, otherwise, only give us chicken if we ask.
The fries which accompanied our sandwiches were also decent but not great, so in the end, the food was a little on the pricey side for the quality and, more importantly, not consistent with the menu from which we ordered.  All in all, a disappointment."}
{"text":"Visited Shady Grove on a Monday evening. My friend and I both had salads which were huge and very good - the Cobb and the Pittsburgh salad. The people next to us had nachos and an order of latkes - both of these also looked so yum! We weren't in the mood for drinks but their happy hour specials looked pretty good. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Shadyside."}
{"text":"loved it. started off with some sort of cucumber/basil drink.. a little strong on the cucumber, but pretty interesting. then my guests and i shared pretzel bites which were delish. i don't remember which burger i got to be honest, but i do remember thinking it was very good.
the only strange thing about the place is the bathroom... it's upstairs and near impossible to find.
i'd go back for sure, and would like to try several more dishes."}
{"text":"Oh Shady Grove you have improved! Or maybe it's the fact that I'm getting old and hit you up for the early bird special (compared to late night service). Either way the pizza is amazing (try the new shrimp option) and service was on point."}
{"text":"I came here on a mildly busy Tuesday night. My server was VERY wonderful. My mom always asks questions about small trivial things on the menu or something written on the wall about the happy hour, but the server was very helpful and was patient with my mom...which I really appreciate. So much so that when the check came, I looked for the server's name to write a review. Aimee, I really appreciate your service and I wish more servers are as awesome as you are. Thank you!

The food was great, the atmosphere is nice, and the service is top notch. 10/10 would recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's not that bad during their happy hours. The beer deals are pretty good. I tried the yak burger and it was \"meh\".

The place does get pretty crowded and hence sometimes seating might be an issue. Its just loud enough (so that you don't have to scream at each other) if you aren't in the very back section. The half price wine nights are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed this time around... 

The mahi tacos were ok, but lacked any type of seasoning on the fish. The Bellini (that is supposed to be one of their popular drinks) wasn't good to me at all. Reminded me of sickening sweet cough syrup...

The service was good, we were always taken care of. Maybe I'll try something else on the menu since the atmosphere is usually very inviting."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar, above average food, friendly staff. The shady burger, shoshito peppers and jalapeño popper dip are all awesome !"}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks! Best think had to be the Capri sun because i felt like a kid just with an adult beverage. The servers were excellent. Left full and happy."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this spot 4 stars is because of the spacing. There's outdoor seating too, but I wish there was a little more room inside the building. The food is great, the atmosphere is great, the specials are great, the selection is great, the prices are great. This is one of those rare places in Pittsburgh that is consistently a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"3.5 rounded up to 4
I like this place. Food is good. Service is ok. atmosphere is ok."}
{"text":"Grabbed take out lunch this afternoon around 1pm and had awesome and quick service. My husband got the shady steak wrap, which was full of flavor and better than expected, with waffle fries. It's a cheesesteak and egg wrap. I got the chick Caesar wrap with fries, which was also great. I love their fries and ranch dressing. The mimosas and soup that a lot of people had on their tables looked delicious :) love this spot when we are visiting Shadyside. The atmosphere is comfortable and fun and the food has always been great!"}
{"text":"I really like Shady Grove. It's simple, low cost and relaxed. There is even some outdoor seating to people watch Shadyside in the summertime. 
My go to meal is their summer salad. Their salads are huge! You wouldn't leave hungry after their bed of lettuce with delicious toppings. I've had other things like sandwiches but always tend to gravitate toward their salads because they are so big and full of flavor.
They also have fabulous happy hour specials to take advantage of if you care for a beverage. Wine Wednesday is always a hit!
I never ever had an issue with service with my many times visiting. Always friendly and attentive.
Always a go to for a simple meal when in the area. I'm telling you, get that summer salad. It's so good I crave it!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Shady Grove yet!?

I have been here so many times, I could not even begin to guess a number. Shady Grove is one of those places that is reliably good--I can't think of anything that I have ever ordered here that I did not like. The menu is large and features a variety of sandwiches (also available as wraps), burgers, pizzas, and HUGE salads. Being a fan of spicy food, some of my personal favorites are the buffalo chicken pizza (self-explanatory) and the Fiero Chicken sandwich (grilled chicken breast, pepper jack cheese, guac, lettuce, tomato, and a spicy habenero sauce). They also have these great crispy french fries which come with the sandwiches. 

They do half-priced bottles of wine on Wednesday nights. I've had both good and bad experiences--it can get REALLY crowded, so if you don't get there early enough you won't get a table. It's kind of awkward when someone in your party has to then carry the wine bottle around.

Bonus points for outdoor seating! Always a good time."}
{"text":"Dope food! Dope service! Dope times! Bee and Liz are excellent employees made the whole experience dope!!"}
{"text":"The staff was really jerky. I had the French onion soup. It was incredibly salty. A friend had a burger that was pretty subpar, especially for over $10."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but the one time I came the food was really good! 

I got the southwestern blackened mahi mahi salad and it was delicious! I actually liked it so much that I've recreated it at home and now it's part of my regular cooking rotation. They also serve it in a giant mixing bowl which I thought was odd at first but in the end it just means you get a lot more salad than your average serving! I also got some sweet potato tatter tots which were tasty as well.

It took us some time to get a table (party of 4) since the place is kind of small and the food is not cheap (around $13-15 a dish) but it's definitely worth it every once in a while!"}
{"text":"This place is a step up from traditional bar food. It's a great place to grab a cheap bite to eat or drink with friends.  I don't think the wait staff is overly friendly but I have never found them to be rude. Half priced wine nights on Wednesday is usually packed but extremely fun.  This place has a cool special pretty much every night of the week.  Happier staff would've bumped up my rating."}
{"text":"Service and drinks were great! We went on a Thursday night and sat at the bar downstairs. Fabulous drink specials and great bartenders!"}
{"text":"It was loud, but a nice atmosphere. The salad I had was served in a giant bowl and would have been perfect if it would have had more than a couple bites of chicken in it. The rest of it was pretty good, though. The server was attentive. The bar made fine drinks. Overall, it was great, except for the seats we had must have been right under the ac vents."}
{"text":"Can you believe I've never been here before?! Crazy, right? Great first experience too!

Our server was the friendliest ever, so that was just the start. I ordered the Veggie Explosion salad and am happy to report it was exactly as advertised! I hate when you get a salad and the toppings are sparse. There were loads of veggies and I especially liked the grilled portobella mushrooms. I thought the balsamic dressing made it a winning combo.

I also ordered the tomato soup, which I believe is always on the menu. It was excellent. I love a nice creamy tomato, and it was just that. I was pleasantly surprised by what a nice lunch it was!"}
{"text":"My wife and brother and wife went here again on Saturday after a long bike ride. Once again it didn't disappoint. We sat outside in the little roped off area next to the street. Our waitress was extremely nice and attentive. I ordered a vodka tonic and a side salad and we split the caprese pizza. This is a must try and one of my favorite pizzas. It has garlic, mozzarella, tomato, and basil. It's simple but delicious, It was cooked to perfection in their brick oven. The side salad was large and very tasty. What we like is Shady Grove always has some drink specials. Great food, service, and vibe. This is a must stop in Shadyside."}
{"text":"I used to come here quite often for late-night drinks, but just recently started coming in for lunch. The service is consistent, and they have great salads/pizza/sandwiches, and super yummy fries! Somehow I ended up here 3 times last week (twice for lunch and once for happy hour), so I got a chance to try each of my favorites. My favorites are the Greek salad, BBQ chicken pizza, the Hawaiian pizza, and this week's discovery - the Hot Veggie sandwich.  Really, you can't go wrong with any of the pizzas though. The crust has a sweet flavor to it that really sets it apart from any other pizza in the area. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water..."}
{"text":"Shady Grove has good food. They have wraps, salads, and pizzas - and a servicable beer & mix drink menu. It's a good place to go and have a conversation over dinner - not that it's quiet, but I remember having a good conversation every time I've gone there.

After 10 they go 21+ and have cheap pitchers."}
{"text":"The main draw for me to the shady grove is during the summer when you can sit on their patio on a side street just right off of Walnut street. When the weather is nice, we've enjoyed a few nights out there drinking a half priced bottle of wine on Wednesdays. 

We recently went to watch a football game inside and it was enjoyable because it wasn't crowded at all and we got a high top table in the corner where we could hang out and talk for a few hours. The inside is not very big and the bar goes down the middle of the restaurant. The food is okay, however we never think to go there for dinner when we are considering options. They do have a pretty large menu and this past time we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip, and nachos and liked both. 

I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a laid back place and some straight forward American food."}
{"text":"Man, I've been going to Shady Grove since 2008, and it's a place with many of my fond memories. That being said, it's also been a place where I've had some of my worst memories too. Perhaps due to being in college and learning how to frequent bars for the first time. Yikes. 

Beer specials are pretty good here, and wine night back in the day was a pretty big hit. I remember that they would close off Walnut Grill at night, which I thought was strange. They should have all the space available, because it can get super crowded here. The food here is pretty decent. A little more on the expensive side for Pittsburgh, but who am I to complain? The pizzas are all pretty good and the sandwiches are nothing to sniff at. 

Service is pretty spotty, both at the bar and the tables. Bartenders are not generally attentive and the waitstaff is usually short-staffed, so it takes awhile for you to get things like water or other small requests. Also, they're not very friendly, which is disappointing. But, it's never really been enough to ruin anything. Overall, Shady Grove is a decent bar/restaurant with subpar service. If you're looking for a low-key drink or meal during the week, Shady Grove is a solid place for just that."}
{"text":"The staff here are friendly and excellent.  They were very accommodating to our party of 4 with 2 babies.  Their food was average pub fare and priced fairly.  I would return in a pinch."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday night with about 8 friends to watch the Steelers game. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. The menu had many different options (tacos, sandwiches, hamburgers, salads). I ordered the Shady Burger and it was delicious! I would definitely recommend ordering it. The side of fries were pretty good, but nothing spectacular. 

I'd definitely come back again to try their other hamburgers!"}
{"text":"If you want spit in your salad dressing youve ordered from the right place. Bummer I was a fan of them until this meal."}
{"text":"Fun place for burgers (incredibly cheap if you luck into half-price night, which we did). We sat at the bar. Comfortable, fun."}
