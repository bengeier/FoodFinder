{"text":"We often stopped here for breakfast after church.  Loved, loved the White Chocolate Raspberry French Toast!  Yum.  They always served breakfast and lunch anytime.  It was especially nice to stop after church on Sunday around 11:30 am.  What a surprise to stop last Sunday for the delicious french toast only to find they had thrown out all the batter for french toast, pancakes and waffles and they would no longer be serving those items after 11:00!!!!!  So, don't have your hopes up for a nice special Sunday breakfast at Buckman's because it won't be happening.  Too bad.  They will lose a lot of breakfast people, because they now have become like any other lunch restaurant--nothing special."}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here the other day and wasn't impressed with the food. The potatoes had that freezer-burn taste. You could definitely tell it wasn't fresh. The country fried steak, which took longer because they didn't have any ready, was very grizzly and tasted warm inside as if it weren't cooked thoroughly. The service was OK, but I wouldn't want to eat here again."}
{"text":"I had been to Buckmans for breakfast and for lunch in the past, usually after a round of golf. This was the first time to try it at the dinner hour. We wanted someplace very informal, close by, good for a very light meal, and inexpensive. Buckmans fit the bill. We got there 10 minutes before closing. The hostess checked with the kitchen and they okayed our being seated. Regarding the ambiance, it is very informal. Unlike at breakfast and lunch, for dinner they have tablecloths and candles on the tables. A nice touch. The view out the floor to ceiling windows is the same at dinner time as it is at breakfast - spectacular. Because it was dark, you don't get to see the golf course. Just the city lights and the Strip. The service was excellent. Our server, Erika, came to our table immediately to take our drink orders. No problem giving us a taste of a beer that we weren't familiar with to see if we liked it (we did!). We decided to share a Reuben on rye and an order of crispy sweet potato fries. The sandwich was perfection!  The bread was a two tone rye that was excellent. And they made the fries crispy as ordered. I really liked that the manager, Kelly, worked the room, talking to each table to make sure everything was going well. For an  informal, inexpensive restaurant with a spectacular view, they are doing a lot of things right. I will definitely be coming back to dine here again soon."}
{"text":"I thought I posted a review...
In any event, this restaurant, SERVICE \"El\" the BEST! The food is consistently wonderful.  The view is outstanding.
Best happy hour...recognized in restaurant and bar.  Terry, the bartender is an expert at every mix...
Visit...you won't be disapointed"}
{"text":"We've eaten here at least twice a month since living in Anthem for the past 15+ years. But recently, there has been a management change and found out the hard way. I had ordered the Rosemary chicken entree $19 and was surprised to receive one piece of chicken leg on my plate with a little bit of vegetables along with a little tiny $3 salad. I asked to speak to the manager about this $19 piece of chicken leg and he said he would take care of it. He came back out with another chicken leg and said here you go and walked away. Previously, this dish was a half of a chicken for $19 ! Not one piece of leg !  Need I say anymore ? Beware and believe me, this will be our last visit and we will spread the word among the community here. This owner will not last long in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy the wonderful view and the service is first rate it is a friendly place to be casual and relax.  Have a cocktail or a beer and order from a very extensive menu you
will not be disappointed.  They also have a daily special.  If you feel like a steak I would
reccomend the steak dinner which consist of salad or soup and potatoes and vegetabe and
a great steak.  The bartender is also special ask for any drink and they can serve it."}
{"text":"Buckmans has great views of the Las Vegas strip. 
Very nice for breakfast or lunch. 
     Deep fried fish and  chips excellent. 
     Great place to stop for a drink after golf"}
{"text":"Never has been anything to rave about but in the past week I know of 3 people who have gotten sick within a couple hours of eating breakfast there.  I am calling the Health Dept in the morning.....service is always bad but getting sick is over the top and we live here....something is not right in that kitchen."}
{"text":"We come here a few times a year with our in-laws, who live down the street.  For several years, the breakfast was beyond serviceable, with some really good choices, prepared properly and quite flavorfully.

In recent years, though, things have changed...and despite multiple complaints to our server for the kitchen, they clearly don't get the message.  So we are done.

Issue 1:  when serving a large party, while it is classy to serve the whole table at once, either you need to teach the chef to time his meals better or serve them as they are ready so everyone gets a hot, fresh meal.  I received a plate this morning with cold Benedict and hot potatoes...yuck.

Issue 2:  speaking of the Benedict, poached eggs are served with an easy yolk, not a hard yolk.  And hollandaise isn't supposed to be flavorless.  Yours is.  And when a patron wants a side, serve it warm...like their meal.

I tell you this every time I come...and it hasn't changed.  Not coming back.

PS:  the 2nd star is for the wonderful party we had there...staff was nice, if not slow."}
{"text":"Buckman's has a very, very nice view of the golf course and all of Vegas.  It's even nicer at night.  The furniture and decor has a dated 90's feel to it.

The service was excellent, and our waiter really couldn't have been better.

The appetizers were all pretty good.  But the entrees were lacking.  The cut of beef that I got tasted like a salisbury steak.  But I enjoyed the experience nonetheless.

It's a good place if you live up in the development, but it's probably not worth it to drive from Las Vegas.   The prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"I am stunned by the great reviews.  The view is great, yes.  When you get over that, there is nothing to recommend the place.  Mediocre food, inconsistent quality, overpriced for what you get, not enough work staff, and an attitude that they are doing you a favor to let you in."}
{"text":"We love coming here for breakfast, they offer several great tasting choices, and always with a great view of the Las Vegas valley down the hill to the north."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!! From the views - to the food - to the SERVICE!! Everything was spectacular! I dined up here with my husband and 2 year old son for breakfast and my server, Diana, came out with the cutest Mickey Mouse pancakes for him! It was so adorable and my son loved it. Huge Mickey Mouse fan. How did she know?? 

The manager, Whitney, came by to check on us which is such a nice touch. Sweetest lady ever! I grabbed their lunch and dinner menu which look well priced and with lot of variety. We will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Awful service at lunch.  Food okay but you need to be prepared to spend the afternoon here."}
{"text":"Another great dinner. Secret gem here this place is. Had the Pot Roast tonight. Very good."}

We recently had a ladies evebt there. They ran out of food! Can you imagine? Never had that happen before in Las Vegas. So it was a set price for a certain menu (which we did not get). The people who came last in line (it was a buffet) got a cookie and a slider. Not a lot for $25 pp meal. I will say the wait staff tried hard to please everyone. It was not their fault but I know I will NOT recommend this location to any of my friends in the future."}
{"text":"I've have tried both lunch and dinner at Buckman's Grille and really enjoyed both! 

For lunch I enjoyed the chicken club sandwich accompanied by a house salad and French fries. Great! It was a large portion and was easily shared by two adults. The fries were stand out, crispy, hot and well seasoned. The chicken on the sandwich was seasoned very well, with what I believe is pesto. I really enjoyed that subtle flavor. Just a hint nothing too over powering. 
We enjoyed lunch so much... and the beautiful view of the golf green and pond overlooking the Las Vegas valley with a optimal view of the strip. We decided we needed to come back another time for dinner and the sunset. 
The sunset at dinner was such a treat, Breathtakingly gorgeous! Our dinner was long enough for us to watch the sunset and the twinkle of the lights come to life from the vegas valley and, most importantly the glamorous strip. 
For dinner my party started with the zucchini chips. They are a must try! Very fresh batter and zucchini. The best fried zucchini I have ever tasted! Served alongside ranch and marinara for dipping. 
I really enjoyed my house salad starter I tried on my previous visit so I ordered that again. 
My dinner selection was the New York strip steak, accompanied by a delicious sauce almost like a gravy but with such depth of flavor (almost coffee like).  Seasonal veggie side was very fresh and delicious. Instead of the potato side I chose to substitute for fries (I really enjoyed my last visit). 
I would also like to add this meal was easily split by two adults, it was a generous portion.

We finished with creme brûlée, it was delicious, light and, was the perfect portion after a filling meal. Normally my party and I are not much of dessert people but with a little convincing by our awesome waiter \"El\" we were happy we decided to try! 
Leading me to the service. They go above and beyond to service their customers. Every waiter/ waitress was great! We really enjoyed our waiter \"el\" he was humorous and entertaining and overall very helpful! Can't wait to come back to have a fun dinner with him. Thanks el!"}
{"text":"Breakfast served was better than average. Service was ok. Worst feature was that windows in dining area were badly in need of a wash. Bad feature in an establishment featuring a Strip/ valley view."}
{"text":"First of all I would come here for breakfast all the time. They had a great breakfast special at a good price..! Great for locals. But like so many other facilities in this community they think everyone that lives here is rich so prices go up and the specials disappear.
And I don't know where the chef comes from but what they offer as a club sandwich is anything but...! It's more like some funky sort of hammy sandwich thing....! And definitely overpriced for what you get..! Anymore you are paying just for the view...and it shows by the almost totally empty dining room. Especially at breakfast..!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had a nice experience. Buckman's is located inside the revere golf club and there is plenty of parking out front. 

Walking in you will notice the sweeping views of the valley. There is floor to ceiling glass with unobstructed views of the golf course and Las Vegas valley. You seat yourself and there was plenty of seating when we arrived around 1:00.

Our drink orders were taken promptly and menus brought. The prices are very reasonable. We went with the Cobb salad and California chicken club. The salad was large with plenty of toppings including avocado and crumbled blue cheese. The chicken club was also good served on fresh bread with beer battered onion rings. 

The service was very good with drinks being refilled regularly. The manager also stopped by to check on us and see if everything was ok. They also have a full bar available if you desire. Overall a really nice lunch with beautiful views."}
{"text":"Pricing- I may be skewed, but I thought the pricing is reasonable. Some of the meat entrees I see usually run over $30 elsewhere in Vegas and California. 

Appetizers:
Tried a few different appetizers, since we had a big party for a Birthday celebration:

Calamari - excellent and tender. Fried just the right amount. Came with two different sauces - marinara and a tartar like sauce. I liked the tartar sauce. 

Brie with roasted garlic - taste rich and awesome. 

Italian Sausage stuffed mushrooms - roasted to perfection. The sausage was flavored just the way I like it. Good quality pork. 

Cream of Asparagus soup - heaven. Just the right amount of saltiness, creaminess and flavor. 

House salad with balsamic vinaigrette - very fresh leaves. The dressing was excellent with the right amount of sweetness. 

For the entree, I had the rack of lamb, medium rare, with squash and sweet potato mash. Both sides tasted great. Loved the sweet potato. The lamb could have been prepared a little more rare, but tasted like an excellent piece of meat with a very tasty sauce at the bottom. 

I also tried some of the NY strip. That was good, too. 

If you like meat and potatoes, with some tasty other sides and appetizers, this place is for you."}
