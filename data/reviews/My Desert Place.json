{"text":"Great place to get home cooking meals. Different menus every week with a soup and choice of 2 ($22) or 3 dishes ($28.5) (Rice not included) 
Call after 12:30pm and schedule for pick up before 8pm. The food was good, maybe a bit on the bland side but probably because they're cooked with less salt/oil/sugar and no MSG.
Bring your own containers which is great for the environment! Very efficient system with no wait time."}
{"text":"First I have to say this is the most inconvenience restaurant take out place I have ever met. My wife call the first time to order in early evening and they said you have to place an order earlier to get it evening. Ok then the second time she called and the menu we had was different from what they had but we still agreed with there order. Then they told her she need to bring a container to pick up our food? Who in the world will go home or find a container for a restaurant to pick up food. If I have to order food for take out that mean I don't have time to cook and would like to pick up food to go home!"}
{"text":"Fact - there really isn't enough time in the world to do everything, especially when you have kids, a house, and both parents working full time.

I could meal plan, but honestly, I have barely had time to go do the requisite grocery shopping -
 we've ended up mostly take out  - which is not the greatest for you.

So enter this place, one of my friends told me about it, when I mentioned I was having difficulty balancing being able to cook dinner for everyone (usually I just focus on cooking for the toddler)  they mentioned that this place as being a place that they use and pricing is pretty quite reasonable - all I would need to do is cook the rice.  

One of the things I like is that they cook with less salt, oil and sugar and no MSG - which is more like to the home cooking and more healthy for you.

You can order either 2 or 3 dishes from the weekly menu, which is released on a weekly basis

The pricing is pretty reasonable and, typically, you do get enough to eat for dinner with enough leftover to eat a lunch or two  - the following day. 

Service is quick, efficient and friendly.

How they work: 
1. review the weekly menu that is e-mailed and place your order anytime after 12:30 pm and allow for, at least, 2 hours between placing your order and picking up (typical time slot I have seen starts at 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm)
2. give them your name and your selections (either 2 or 3 dishes - both options come with soup)
3. REMEMBER the order number they assign you
4. pick up your food (Bring your own containers) and pay (CASH ONLY)
5. Enjoy

So far this place is a godsend, especially for busy families that may not want be eating out all the time - so this place is a happy middle ground for everyone ."}
