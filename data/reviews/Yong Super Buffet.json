{"text":"It is in the same building as the Great Wall Buffet was. We went to Great Wall ONCE, and swore to never go again.  After they re-opened under the new name we decided to give them another shot, and it was very good on that day (about 2 months ago). Yesterday we decided to go back, and here is the result:   1- Every symptom of a declining buffet. Barely warm meet and sides, sad looking salad bar, freezer burnt ice cream, bland food with tons of salt to compensate, the fish tasted like paper mush.  2- the service was good, our waitress was very attentive  3- priced at 13.99 a person, which is fine for a generic buffet. Unfortunately our 2nd experience was so bad that i wouldn't go there even for free"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan! I went the first day they opened and it wasn't quite ready. I went again yesterday and it was incredible! The sushi selection was vast and they even had sashimi.  Very fresh and very delicious.  It doesn't taste like all you can eat sushi at all. The best part of this restaurant is the made to order stir fry.  You can get anything you want, make your own plate and they cook it for you.  You have to try it, there is nothing else quite like it. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because they were a little understaffed.  They had the same person at the stir fry making sushi and he couldn't quite keep up. Once they get more staff, this place will be 5 star."}
{"text":"Wow..!!! This is the best version so far among all restaurants that been in this location... New table setup, new staff and food is GOOD... Not great, but definitely GOOD for the price.. I been there 3 times in May 2014 and i always pay 12 bucks, tax in including drink (sprite).  Best Dim Sum EVER..!! And once again, the in-house grill taste good... More variety of salad and desert.  If you didnt try yet this Yong Super Buffet, you should go now..!!!   Check my pics..!!"}
{"text":"The was food undesirable. If you go, eat the chicken wings, fried rice and the waffles. Avoid all other foods for your own safety. Fruits come straight from grocery store fruit cups and the Chocolate icecream tastes like everything but chocolate. The price is good. You get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Have a make your own stir fry  grill in the back lots of seafood (muscles/shrimp type) Not great, not grand, just good --- friendly staff and quick service ---   oddly enough ,the hostess called me out on being there with \"a new lady\" the one time I have ever been there.  While I realize she mistook me for another customer -- my wife (of 8 years) and daughter(7) were somewhat taken aback to hear that I had a girlfriend. (they took it in stride as I work from home with my wife -- we are together 24/7  and knew there was  no way I could have been there)...  So if you are planning on cheating -- don't take your wife here -- you will be called out ;)"}
{"text":"They had improved a bit after they had been open for a while, not great but worth the cheap cost.  We went back today about a month after our last visit, and they have gone down the tubes.  The sushi was horrid (I have never seen fish cut so thin!), the roast beef was cooked to shoe leather, the grill was gone, the soup was watery, the egg rolls were tough and leathery, and there was no dim sum or dumplings at all.  I had a hard time finding anything that was edible.  Even what passed for desserts was awful.  We will not be back again.  I was shocked how busy they were, but I guess the price will bring people in regardless of how horrible the food is."}
{"text":"Phone disconnected, inside of the windows buzzing with flies, no sign of any work being done inside or out despite the deadline (since passed) on the city's notice, police tape still there, broken window due to rock-throwing vandals.  Owners have abandoned this place (and will probably resurface somewhere else).  Hopefully something decent can move in.  Last thing we need is another AYCE \"asian\" place."}
{"text":"Terrible, food selection was poor. Items fruit items not in season. No lobster as suggested on website."}
{"text":"Was just there today hoping that it would simply be a re-branded Great Wall Buffet,  but I was mistaken.   There is no: - Teppanyaki - Sushi (mostly cooked vegetables with rice, cooked carrots were made to look like salmon)  - Seafood,  there was a small amount of shrimp on ice,  but no crab or anything else - Weekend specials   There is only: - 2 hot tables of generic buffet fare - practically the same dessert as Great Wall (which is to say not much)   We were mostly disappointed because the video on their site shows what appears to be good sushi and seafood, but restaurant did not live up to the expectations the video gave us.   We actually didn't even eat when we were seated,  we looked at the selection and decided to just drink the soda we ordered and leave.   I would say,  if you like generic buffet food then the price is probably right and you may want to give it a try. If you want a good experience,  I guess you should just pay a bit more for it."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times and I will continue to go back. Worth their price of admission, great service, and the restaurant was clean. However the food is just fine and selection is not great.   There were too many onions in the chilli chicken and pepper chicken. There may of been 4 meat options but in two of those options you can barely find any meat among the heaps of onions or peppers. Most of the cooked vegetable were either undercooked (IMO) or poorly seasoned (tbh I realize I may be weird though because I actualy prefer no seasoning on my vegetables).   There were great dessert options and the waffle bar was cool. I'm not a huge seafood guy so I won't say anything about it besides that I liked the muscles. There was a nice selection of sides.     Overall it was a decent buffet and defintely worth its price. I would recommend this restaurant but I defintely think that you should not set your standards high as the quality of the restaurant reflects its fair price."}
{"text":"NEVER EAT HERE. The vegetable chow mien tasted like paper towels. The meatballs were made of bread. The dessert fruit tasted like it was picked out and separated from Del Monte fruit cups. The muscles taste like they were marinated with ocean floor and beach sand, and I found seaweed still in one.   If you need to check this place out, I get it. Sometimes you gotta stick to your own guns and make your own opinions. Just a suggestion stick to the salad options and the make you own stir fry at the back, and for heavens sake don't eat the multicoloured marshmallow pudding."}
