{"text":"I may have had a little too much to drink the couple times I ate here but I thought the food was unreal and their presentation is even more impressive. I got the shredded beef enchiladas and it's all I thought about for the next week. Seriously. Like most things in Scottsdale it can get expensive fast but this is one of those few places where I just ignore the price column."}
{"text":"This restaurant only gets one star for the ambiance.. food was terrible.. did not come the way we ordered it.. felt like crap afterwards.. service was even worse.. actually had to get up to find the waitress! Bleh.. wish we could rewind and eat almost anywhere else :-/"}
{"text":"We ate here last night with 8 people. 4 adults and 4 kids.     Queso is good as well as table side guacamole.    Kids meals include a drink  and are really good. Burger or quesadilla or burrito !  Cucumber drink was great.   Tacos are more like street tacos w great flavor."}
{"text":"A go to favorite. Never disappointed always happy with service and meals. The menu is diverse for all tastes. A consistent Fox concept restaurant."}
{"text":"Nate and the team served up an excellent evening, great food and service. Way to go team."}
{"text":"Pros- Always seated quickly Food is great - 5 stars for food  Price point is very good - you definitely get your money's worth   Cons - Depending on who you get the servers are often very slow, disorganized, nonchalant ~ such a shame!"}
{"text":"Love the ambience! Another Fox Group success! This place has amazing mexican/southwest style food. Very very good. The Esquites\" Grilled Mexican Street Corn is a must, enchiladas are to DIE for. Rice was a little disappointing but other items surpassed my expectations. A MUST visit! Not the cheapest but worth it. 2 people around $45-50 including a cocktail each."}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix on a business trip and the first night I went to blanco I was blown away.  My bartender,  Travis, was extremely knowledgeable about the product and I was able to try tequila in a way I never had before.  The service was outstanding, the tequila was outstanding and the overall experience was great.  The reason I am giving this place two stars is because of the experience I just left there with.  I don't even know the name of my bartender because he didn't introduce himself.  When I asked him for the $20 tequila that I had the first night I went he told me that \"oh we don't even have that, I know it's on the menu but it's at [a different place]\"  I was ordering an ultra, top shelf tequila, and he offered instead a patr√≥n. .. standard drunk college tequila. I asked again.  Are you sure you don't have the El Tesoro \"paradiso\".  He eventually found it.  Long story short.  I sat at the bar with an empty beer and an empty tequila after only one glass of each, ready to spend money, disappointed that my last night in Phoenix was hosted by a bartender who was too interested in the cute girl next to me (not that I blame him too much but she worked there) I left un attended to and disappointed in a restaurant that I thought was a real diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"I am not the one to write reviews.  My boyfriend and I decided to do our \"date night\" at The Biltmore Blancos on Friday night. We were seated fairly quickly and proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait some more. Finally a very nice man came to our table and apologized that we had not been served. Shortly after, our waiter arrived and put in our order as quickly as possible. It ended up being a perfect storm, the main dishes arrived before the apps, the meals came with the items we asked to be removed in them etc.. But the awesome thing is that although the wait and meal didn't go as planned, we had 4 different people check up on us and make sure that everything was being resolved. The real testament of a quality company is not how the act during easy times, but how the respond during difficult. The staff at Blancos could NOT have been friendlier and hardworking. Not only did they provide free appetizers and drinks, they also paid for our whole meal at the end of the night. Long story long, we left feeling great. We will be back, and more often than even before! Thank you Blancos for your excellent customer service and amazing food."}
{"text":"The cheese crisps, veggie tacos and margaritas are awesome all in a cool, youngish, hip restaurant. I didn't really care for the queso but everything else is great. I highly recommend the place for food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food still about the same. Not great but passable.  Service was lousy, lousy, lousy.  Talk about an attitude from servers.    Cleanliness.  Yuck.  Server picks up glasses from table beside our table.  Pours water in the glass,  Wipes clean the lipstick marks.  Places back on shelf for next person to be served.  Pretty sure that is not how its supposed to be done.   Servers would much rather stand around chatting than actually looking after customers.  Most Fox restaurants are about a 3 1/2.  This one IMHO, at best a 2."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and service at Blanco, and the food even more!  We had a very fun evening here.   Take advantage of Happy Hour if you can!  Half price on their crisps (delicious) and starters and house margaritas (all the margaritas on the menu are eliglble). What a great deal!   We loved the chipotle shrimp and corn, braised short rib and avocado and cheese and guacamole crisps.   After consuming a fair amount of chips and salsa and all the crisps we hardly had room for our entrees so we split a few things. One was chicken fajitas which my sister claimed were the best fajitas she had ever had in her life. They mix all the \"toppings\" together with the meat instead of having you add your own ingredients to it. She really liked that. My husband and I shared the Machaca Beef Tacos (braised short rib, green peppers, onions). I loved the short rib flatbread and the tacos also did not disappoint. Yum!!   We also had very good service here!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Was at vacation here in Scottsdale and blown away by all the great staff and great food. Super nice people. Cool atmosphere and excellent food! Would definitely come here many many more times!"}
{"text":"i was here for a lunch meeting.  I had tacos, chips and salsa.  I thought they were very flavorful and good.  Carne Asada was my favorite.  The Gucamole dip was very good.  When traveling to Scottsdale i will hit this place again."}
{"text":"Since I am stuck in AZ for a few months due to work I decided to check out some Mexican restaurants. Blanco was \"recommended\" by a co-worker who is native to the Scottsdale area. I wasn't a fan of the chips, a bit too thin with little taste, salsa was watery but had a decent kick. Margarita was OK but I have had better in Florida. I ordered a combo plate with Enchiladas and something that was supposed to be a Taco with chicken, I have no idea what it was but it did have a good taste. So my first shot at Mexican food in AZ was average at best, I hope to try a few more while I am here. One suggestion, if the wait time is over 30 minutes go somewhere else, we were told 30 minutes and it was more like 1 hour before we sat down."}
{"text":"I hit up this place last night, it was quite impressive. Good atmosphere and food it's no big star (probably not enough hipsters in AZ)  but a competitive \"fancy taco\" . Service was decent,  the bartender was a little intolerant of decision  making but who isn't. .. Try it..."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The burritos are the best ones I have ever had - and are completely original. Black beans with all sorts of squash, spinach, corn, etc.   I am a really picky eater and they are always happy and willing to take out the things I don't like (pico de gallo, ew!). The first time I ever went to this restaurant, our waitress knew EVERY SINGLE INGREDIENT to that burrito and was extremely friendly.   I definitely recommend going during the day, though, because it gets crowded at night and a little loud. It also can turn a little \"scottsdale/snobbsdale\" at night, and this is coming from someone who lives here. Also the wait time can be pretty terrible sometimes.  Either way, I wouldn't skip this place! I love it."}
{"text":"Ben Raymond was a great waiter and provided us with perfect service and hospitality. Food was good queso was a bit thick and could have been a little warmer."}
{"text":"Tried Blanco taco for the first time today.  The restaurant is trendy, clean and the open air was inviting.   The service was great.  They brought a large bowl of chips with sufficient sauce.   The tacos looked good and the skillet enchilada was very unique, and had not seen enchiladas served like this anywhere else.  I personally like enchiladas and this skillet version looked fabulous but did not deliver on taste, serving size (small) and even though we ordered chicken enchilada there was hardly any chicken.   I see other reviews where people like this unique dish, so I recommend you try it and see for yourself.  Overall a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"We had Baja chicken tacos and mahi tacos absolutely delicious with house margarita or a corona with lime!! we are from SF SD loved atmosphere,people very friendly"}
{"text":"This is a flop for SF Restaurant. Boring Mexican food. Come on Sam, you can come up with a more authentic menu than that. Atmosphere is also very boring. Went there two times keep thinking it would get better. Wrong!"}
{"text":"This place was good but more upscale than the dive-y authentic Mexican we were looking for."}
{"text":"Good for drinks and light meals/appetizers, especially the blood orange margaritas!"}
{"text":"To me this is like all Fox restaurants, the concept is wonderful, the execution..meh.  This was my first visit. I had the enchilada. We were warned that the enchilada was \"stacked\", and I'm ok with that. Actually, the enchilada and how it was served was really good. I liked the small cast iron pan that was perfectly sized to a corn tortilla. The cheese, lots of it and melty too. The sauce, that was where this took a drastic turn for the worse. Enchilada means \"in chili\". The sauce wasn't chili, I'm not sure it was even something like red pepper, maybe more tomato, and sweet not savory. Had this had a more authentic chili sauce on it, it would have been my new favorite and it would have been incredible. I'm probably lucky it didn't because I can still fit through the door.   As for the service, location, atmosphere...those are all good, but I go to a restaurant to eat, not look around."}
{"text":"We had such an amazing experience here!  We came all the way from Colorado on a road trip and we were staying at the Embassy Suites across the way.  We stumbled upon this amazing place on our walk through the mall.  Our waitress was Brittany, she was absolutely amazing and attentive.  Not only was our experience here amazing but the food was phenomenal!  We were here for two nights so we decided we loved it so much we wanted to go for dinner on our last night as well.  Our waitress the second night had long blonde hair, I can't remember her name but she was amazing too!  Not only does the food make the experience wonderful,  but the kindness and attentiveness of all the staff here does.  We will absolutely be coming back the next time we are in town.  My son Landon (he has white blonde hair!) gave them a picture and signed it for them because he enjoyed the experience as well!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Unfortunately, food and drinks did not match the staff's demeanor. Cold tacos, horrible drinks... If the food was as good at the staff, I might go back"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere good food. The wait on a Sunday at 5 pm was 45 minutes. Defiantly not worth the wait. There are too many other great places in the area."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and they never disappoint. Great atmosphere and excellent food.  I am craving a margarita as a type.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I hate to write a bad review about this place but it just isn't that good. I fully recommend this place for drinks and appetizers. Great salsa and guacamole but thats about it.   The dinner entrees are overpriced and average at best. There is nothing on the menu that sticks out as being great. There are too many other places in this city that are better.   I do not recommend this place for dinner. Drinks and appetizers only."}
{"text":"UNREAL food. I have never liked Mexican food in my life but this was incredible. Tortilla soup was amazing, must-try! Guacamole was also amazing. It's a younger crowd there from what I saw and a really nice chill vibe."}
{"text":"I have severe gluten allergies so when I heard they have dedicated gluten free fryers for their corn chips I was eager to try this place. Hands down they have the best fajitas in town, the chips and salsa is also excellent! I also love their Ceasar salad with gluten free corn croutons, I've eaten here several times and no been exposed to gluten. The staff is very knowledgeable and accommodating to food allergies and the food is delicious! I prefer the arcadia location as it's typically less crowded during meal hours and more parkting. I have had to park far away when I go to the Scottsdale location."}
{"text":"Overpriced for an average salad! Would you pay $17 for this chunk of fish on a bed of lettuce??!"}
{"text":"Nice patio if you can get service. Food is average. We like coming here due to the convenience and ambiance but every time we sit on the patio it takes 15 minutes to even be acknowledged. Servers walk by on their way to serve someone, I don't know who. Help I need a margarita!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday night around 6 PM thinking it would not be busy.We were quoted 20 to 40 minute wait but ended up getting seated after an hour and 15 minutes. There were about 5 open tables when we got seated. Our server came by once and we ordered everything at that point. He never returned to see if we needed anything else not even another drink. We never got our waters we asked for as well. Then we had to hunt him down for our check which he brought 10 minutes later. I won't be returning. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because my tacos were good."}
{"text":"Another solid Fox Restaurant Concepts establishment.  The FRC has developed a winning formula for differently themed restaurants.  Blanco is the Mexican outpost for this group.  Is the food authentic? No, but the food is good and I have never been let down from the numerous items we have had.  The chorizo, green chile and tomato cheese crisp rocks!  They also make a mean michelada...think bloody mary with lime juice replacing the lemon and a fine Mexican lager replacing the vodka."}
{"text":"fantastic place with great atmosphere - my taco was swimming in oil - but still tasted fantastic!  Amazing happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"Great margaritas...nice tequila selection. Kid friendly, great atmosphere.  The bar staff was unattentive and kind of clueless.  Ahi Tacos where awesome as well as cheese crisps.  Nice experience over all"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it, pleasant to sit outside, the music is just loud enough that it covers the road noise but so loud you can't have a conversation.  Really tasty tacos - both the chicken and the pork. Good margaritas especially the blood orange one. Friendly and efficient service even when it was very busy on a Saturday night. Would happily go back."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. Drinks and food were really good - fajitas, short-rib enchiladas and tacos. Our amazing waiter Sean went above and beyond!!!  The chocolate cake was delicious."}
{"text":"Cool casual place to go for good food and drinks. The staff was very friendly. Starting from the Nate the GM to our waiter Manny who was awesome!! He was knowledgeable and made great recommendations. Enjoyed our steak fajitas and green chili pork enchiladas of course with guacamole."}
{"text":"Very happy with our meal here! Sitting outside in December is a whole new world for us!  Walked in and immediately greeted by the hostess. Offered an outside table if we wanted which sounded like a great & different idea for us in December!  Chips and Salsa right away! Awesome Chips, Salsa was boring and not chunky like I prefer.  Awesome and helpful waitress that was very attentive, offered to explain the menu in full, but we pretty knew what we wanted!   Started off with a Happy Hour Dip Trio(Charro Beans, Queso, Guacamole) and I went for a $5 H-H Classic Margarita on the Rocks and my wife went for the $5 H-H Mixed Berry Margarita. We were even asked; Salt, Sugar, or Nothing on the Rim!  The Dip Trio was yummy, standout being the Guacamole. Super fresh! Beans were nice and creamy with tiny little pieces of bacon, Queso was a tasty addition as well.  Margaritas were great as well! Mine was just a perfect example of a Classic, wife's had a nice, but not overwhelming Berry Flavor!   We also ordered the Shrimp and Crab Ceviche which was very simple, yet divine. Most places simply over do the Citrus, not the case here. It was present, but didn't dominate the dish. Awesome shrimp and crab pieces in there!   Moving on to our actual meal. My wife went for the Chipotle Shrimp Tacos with black beans. Again, perfect Shrimp, nice flavor, awesome Tortillas!(More than likely homemade)   I went for some goodies from the H-H Menu; Beef Taco, Pork Taco, BBQ Pork Torta(Think Big Slider Size) Every thing was great as expected! BBQ Pork was tender with great BBQ flavor and a little heat. Beef and Pork Tacos shared the same tenderness with lots of flavor! $3 Happy Hour Tacos(BIG) and $4 Happy Hour Torta! M-F 4p-6p  As you can see, YES we ordered a lot of food! And pretty much ate it all short of some of the beans and chips! A place that we will definitely go back to in the future when we're in the mood for more of a sit-down type of Mexican Dinner!"}
{"text":"I work for a hotel near the Biltmore and I send all of my guests to Blanco because I know they're going to come back satisfied. The environment is clean, fresh and friendly. I recommend folks here in confidence because this is a restaurant that maintains standards and the food is delicious. The flavors all come together, local ingredients used and match well with the vast selection of margaritas, sangria, etc. I brought some friends one afternoon and the service was superb. I was really happy as a guest and I love finding great places to eat. Five stars to Blanco, keep it up!"}
{"text":"First time at this resturant and it was amazing it felt like I was surrounded by friends! Our waiter Ben was amazing excellent customer service! He was so much fun to be around don't ever let him go you would be losing a great team member! I will definitely be recommending this Resturant to friends and family!"}
{"text":"Great food and drink. The traditional margaritas are the best. Sara was our server and she was very knowledgable about the menu and was quite entertaining. The cheese enchilada that I had was one of the best ever."}
{"text":"No wi-fi and the manager doesn't know the password to access it. If you need a spot with wireless Internet, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Although the food was good.. We waited for a while to get our order taken.. It took them along time to being my beer.. I give them 2 stars because they messed up on my order. Staff was friendly.. But seemed like the waiter that waited us was far too busy to check on us."}
{"text":"Was really expecting more based reviews and what friends were saying about Blanco but really its pretty much just OK.  Food was OK... not bad, but nothing that got me excited. Service was just under OK which I find to be pretty standard at Fox restaurants. On the plus side the decor is pretty nice and it is a nice atmosphere to dine in.   Not sure I would go back."}
{"text":"Another Fox restaurant with awesome vibes. The vegetarian fajitas were some of the best, most unique I've had (not your typical veggie medley on a sizzle plate). My wife enjoyed her tacos just as much. We snagged comfy seats on the patio overlooking Scottsdale Road."}
{"text":"This place is lovely.  The ambiance is very modern and upscale casual.  It is perfect for a date night or a girls night out!  I went with two other ladies while we were here visiting Phoenix.  The manager was such a gentleman and so accommodating.  He came to our table by mistake in an attempt to rectify some gift card issue another table was having.  The friend I was with mistook his question and thought he was offering a gift card to tables as some sort of contest, and began to give him the story as to why we were in Phoenix and why we should win.  He was so taken back, that he was very gracious and paid for our meal.  The margaritas were superb.  They are unique and have the right amount of alcohol to mixer composition.  The food is also very good.  They do a modern spin on some Mexican favorites, like open faced quesadillas!  I definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Blanco is a great place to go for vegetarians looking for quick weight loss. And I thank you for the three-day colonic that resulted from eating here. Despite the restaurant touting its vegetarian / gluten free options (even here on yelp), rudimentary items, such as the \"cheese crisp with guacamole\" are, in fact, lard-based. I understand lard is used in authentic Mexican cuisine, which this is not.  Here's a \"concept\" for you, Fox - label your menus in accordance with 21st century standards. As a result of this visit and your irresponsible practices, I'm removing all Fox restaurants from my dining and entertainment repertoires - too many other superior (and responsible) options in town."}
{"text":"CJ, best bartender I have found in the area. Solid food and beverage advice.  Great discussion with other patrons, good atmosphere... everyone is very friendly and kids are welcome.... they need a location in Portland"}
{"text":"Good Job Fox!  Visited on a Monday night just about happy hour, good service, ambiance hip and trendy, plenty of staff and promptly served with good chips and good salsa. Happy hour margaritas a bit sweet for me and my date so our bill was about $20 cheaper than it could have been.  Crispy Shrimp Tacos delicious, Mahi Salad hit the spot.  White rice was different and the charro beans very good.   Fox has a way with their restaurants that keeps them just shy of genius but way above run of the mill. We ate at Culinary Dropouts the day before! All good."}
{"text":"Bianco is a great place to go for a reasonably priced dinner with good ambiance and solid rendition of Mexican food.   Yup, there are holes-in-the-wall tacquerias with tastier food.  But Bianco is spot-on in terms of  overall concept with good service and modern furnishing. Puts this on a repeat list."}
{"text":"I don't live near any good mexican food, so for me, it was good.  Went on a business lunch so I couldn't try their tequilla, I'll be back.  Good chips, not the blase crap from a bag.  Great service, especially in Scottsdale, no attitude!  I had the carnitas tacos and shrimp tacos.  Fillings were great, but way, way too much cabbage!"}
{"text":"Wife's food good. Mine fair. Waitress bad ! Parked in adjacent parking lot , waitress to validate parking ticket, didn't and couldn't leave parking lot. This sucks! Can't even buy ticket ! Had to back and get ticket/ token to leave! Not going back!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here when I was in town with my wife. The other people on our party were late (as always) and they were very accommodating.  The starters are AMAZING and honestly my favorite part of the whole meal.  I would HIGHLY recommend getting their white queso and street corn. I loved the street corn so much I had them substitute it for the rice that comes with the tacos. When it comes to the tacos, pick 3, any 3. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, and good happy hour prices. The service was also very good. We had the tacos, the corn starter, and some guacamole. Nothing was stellar, but I would return again for happy hour or if someone else suggested it."}
{"text":"Very sad about Blanco! I love Fox Restaurants and was shocked that this is connected to that company. My hubby and I did a quick date night last week and chose Blanco since we have seen it so many times in passing. The Guac was $9 and seriously the size of a golf ball served in a large bowl. I ordered a dinner salad I think it was $12 for a bread sized plate of lettuce a couple tomatos and avacados and about a half a pound of dressing. I usually get extra dressing on the side but no need for that at this place my lettuce was wilted from the amount of dressing on the salad. This would not have been terrible if it was good but it tasted terrible. My husband took the waiters recommendation and ordered enchiladas. That was probably the best thing about our experience HOWEVER it tasted like cream of mushroom soup out of the can and came in a little petite size skillet for I think $15 or $16 bucks. I would never go back not even for half price. I will stick to sauce and Fox Sports Grill. For Mexican I will make the long drive to Val Vista and Baseline to eat at Nandos. Nothing compares to their food!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and I couldn't have more pleased with the food and service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the tacos and mixed and matched the 3. The best was (not surprisingly) the award winning BBQ taco. The rice is delicious! I also had the blood orange margarita and I will definitely get it again. So good. Will be back."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the first time yesterday with my family and we were blown away! Excellent food, fresh and savory! High quality food for a decent price. We had this awesome waitress who made our experience very pleasurable. The food comes out very quickly, which pleasantly surprised me!   We ordered appetizers from their happy hour menu. We had their nachos, quesadilla and three dips. All were good, but I would recommend their nachos, lots of toppings and flavor! For dinner, I had their carne asada tacos. It came with three tacos along with beans and rice. Add some hot sauce to those tacos and you are set! My sister got the Mexican cobb salad, brother got cheese enchiladas, his partner for fajitas. Didn't get to taste, but it all looked delicious.   Overall, I highly recommend this place for anyone to try a contemporary twist on Mexican food. Excellent customer service, environment and awesome food. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This place was good but it's not a cheap authentic Mexican meal.  The chips were thick & not warm or salty so they were not that good & I had they chicken enchilada with verde (green) sauce & they were just ok. They also use a smll iron skillet to layer their corn tortillas, chicken cheese & sauce almost like a mini lasagna instead of rolled flour tortilla enchiladas. The black beans were ok & the boyfriend was disappointed with their rice (\"tasteless\") & their smoky salsa & the grilled corn was way underdone. We each had 1 import beer no apps or guac & our bill was over $60. Seems pretty touristy & hipster"}
{"text":"The mojito was good but it took a long time to get service."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing! Great food and service is phenomenal. Manuel made our evening very enjoyable and was extremely attentive. The berry margaritas are phenomenal and the tacos were also very good. The atmosphere is fun and classy. Overall I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I ordered a burrito to go and they forgot beans! Also took forever for them to serve me even though I had called ahead. I was on my lunch break so was rushed for time. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I am amazed and grateful for the customer service at this restaurant! We ordered take out today and when we got home and opened our food, the steak salad was missing the steak. We called and reported the mistake and were told our ENTIRE bill was credited. I even told them the rest of our order was fine but they insisted on giving us a total refund.  In today's world you don't see that kind of concession. Thank you, Blanco!"}
{"text":"Great service at an enjoyable place, our party of 9 were all pleased with the service and the cuisine.  I had the carne asada burrito with a red chile sauce that, as the waitress suggested, was epic!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Service was spot on, very attentive! We asked for recommendations so we ordered what they told us and could not have been more impressed. Food was great! Atmosphere is perfect. Casual, friendly and delicious. Nothing not to love! See you soon!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe that I have not reviewed this place yet!  Okay, so it can get a little busy but it's worth the wait!  They have very, very good guacamole and chips. It's different from Barrio guac, and I actually like it better. I do wish they offered a half order of it though because it is so much guac. It's usually just 2 of us, so I'm sure if you have a larger party, it's a good amount. I am an enchilada addict and I am about to say something never uttered before: this place has the absolute best chicken enchiladas I have EVER had. They come in a little cast iron skillet with cheese and sour cream on top. So amazing. I will ask to go there on my bday this year. We got the market corn last time and were not fans, but people seem to like it.  I had a Cuban classic (mojito) last time and it was also delicious!  This place can get a little expensive but between the drinks, guac and sharing the chicken enchiladas, we get plenty for under $60.  I wish they would open one in Tempe or Chandler so I didn't have to drive so far but this place + a movie at the esplanade across the street is a good date combo."}
{"text":"The music of Coach Taylor was amazing!  Food was good.   Wait staff was blah.   A simple hello, smile, or thank you would have went a long way.  Would come back for the music but the wait staff is definitely affecting my decision."}
{"text":"I am not really sure how this place is receiving a 3.5 star rating? Went there for happy hour tonight, the prices are a little steep for HH but it was what I expected to pay at a Scottsdale restaurant.   First off, we were greeted and sat instantly. Our server Drew was bright and friendly. Went over the HH menu and the regular one. Waters with chips and salsa were brought out within minutes, followed by beers. Our food was delivered hot and before we finished our first drink! He continued to check on us and made sure we were taken care of.   We both tried all 3 tacos on the happy hour menu, not a fan of the chicken one but 2 out of 3 isn't bad.  We also had to try the yummy rich chocolate cake and we were not disappointed. I was a huge fan of the salsa too!   Great patio and environment, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! By far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. I love the atmosphere in the restaurant. My favorite dish is the Mexican chopped salad with Salmon. So delicious! Also the chips and salsa are very dangerous. Warning..If your on a diet do not eat one!"}
{"text":"Do not get the house margarita!!  Tastes like cheap tequila on ice."}
{"text":"Y"}
{"text":"Service was really good despite them being extremely busy.  Queso fundido was different and not in a good way from the past three times ordered -- way less chorizo and way more onions than usual, which means we won't be ordering it again.  My tacos were yummy, I got pork green chili, chicken, and crispy shrimp with black beans and rice and was very satisfied.  One of our companions got the steak chopped salad and thought it was tough and chewy and a poorer cut of meat than usual (she gets it every time)  so the quality seems to be going down, which is sad because we've always loved Blanco's.  It will be a while before we try again."}
{"text":"Here's why I'm only giving a 4:   I love Blanco -- I've been to the location in Tucson more times than I can remember, so when I left Sky Harbor and realized I could have Blanco in Phoenix, I was psyched.   Service was excellent, and we hit happy hour, but unfortunately, at this location, I felt that the kitchen was a little lazy. I got my favorite BBQ pulled pork tacos, but they were missing the slaw and onions that take their flavor from delicious to HOLY TACO HEAVEN.   Don't let my review sway you, check this place out. But maybe try one of the other locations? Hopefully management will take this as a heads up, and I'll be able to update my review. Until then, you'll find me in Tucson watching the sunset with the Blanco Mango Jalapeno Margarita (and my tacos done just right)."}
{"text":"Great food...the tacos are very yummy, guacamole is very good too. Fun selection of margarita's and friendly staff!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 5 times and the food is always mediocre and bland. If you like authentic Mexican this is not the place for you. The food also takes a really long time to come out. I like some of the other fox restaurants but this one is disappointing."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and eating at several places that we have never tried. This was the best place by far. I wish there was a Blanco near where I live. I would go weekly."}
{"text":"Amazing food , service and atsmosphere!  Best Braised Shortrib Tacos on the planet! You will never be disappointed.  Go there!  You will love, love, love it."}
{"text":"we really liked this blanco. such a fun place with amazing cocktails and the best gaucamole ever. seriously i dont know how they do it but i cant stop eating it.  Blood orange margarita is off the chart. Quality of food for the money is really wonderful. started with a chorizo cheese crisp and loved it. then we shared some tacos, enchiladas and a burger. I would recommend everything we ate. the beef short rib enchiladas are to die for. Plus the vibe is really fun, patio is beautiful and comfy and ridiculous selection of incredible tequilas. Will be eating here often. great mexican food that doesnt leave you feeling like you just consumed a jar of lard. really nice clean fresh ingredients prepared with care. Love Love Love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food - the nachos and cheese crisps are both amazing.  Margaritas are great too!  Fun restaurant, casual, perfect for appetizers and drinks!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Atmosphere is modern and elegant. We got the fish tacos - so delectable. Came out in less than 5 min. The fish was perfectly blackened and grilled. The chips were warm and not drenched in oil like most Mexican restaurants serve. The salsa was flavorful. Our server Gabriel was great! Very knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. Everyone was friendly. We loved our experience and will def be returning!!"}
{"text":"Great food! - Appetizers and entrees. Cabin a business luncheon so it's great for large groups."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place on Fridays for happy hour! They used to have this guy named Taylor Ouellette playing all kinds of jams in the bar area. Really wish they would bring him back. Anyways, great food, great crowd, and good vibes!"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and delicious food.  I am not a huge fan of Mexican but was extremely surprised at how impressed I was with the food.  Fresh and delicious.  Will return"}
{"text":"We love the tacos and the blood orange drink it was really refreshing and the wave us refills , it's a good place for lunch when you are in the Arcadia area"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  But honestly, skip the Biltmore location and go straight to Scottsdale.  Service is pretty spotty at the Biltmore."}
{"text":"Good and fresh ingredients, loved the chicken with avocado salad. Fun atmosphere with high ceilings. We were in a bit of a hurry and the wait staff was very attentive and prompt. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Blanco is so good! The food was simple but incredibly flavorful and the atmosphere was laid back but nice. Service was awesome! I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Service was not up to par, food was terrible.  I told the server that I don't eat cheese, she did not explain that the guac was made with cheese, she just didn't bring it.  When I asked her about it, she said \"well it has cheese\", didn't offer me avocado slices or any other substitution.  I ordered the mushroom tacos and the tacos literally had ONE cubed piece of a mushroom per taco!! I had to tell a different waiter about it and he had to ask the cook to put mushrooms on my mushroom tacos.  They were disgusting.  The vegetables I got were soggy and too salty to eat!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on the way to our favorite- Seasons 52, and we were excited to try it.  The place had a nice feel to it, good crowd inside and out on the patio setting the mood.  Didn't live up to the setup.  The host stand was being held down by what looked to be middle schoolers who were friendly enough but just getting into the workforce and still getting it all figured out...works at Red Lobster but doesn't really match expectations here.  Patio was full so they put us at a table that borders the kitchen. Usually I don't really get bothered by that but  think it was just a little too close cause I felt like we were just short of being in the action - felt like I was back trying to make the adults table as an adolescent. The food- good menu with a lot of options.  Waitress made sure to let us know that the tacos were 'street' type which is supposed to be I guess small but really these things were piled high with ingredients but I'm getting ahead of the review.  The appetizers looked like they were going to be a great start and we picked the Ceviche and the Roasted Corn dishes. Now I'm a bit of a Ceviche connoisseur  so I always apprehensively order this dish knowing it's one of those signature dishes that the sous chef gets to prove to the big man that hiring him was the right decision. Should have used Jobbing.com instead of Craig's list.  I like a South American version like the one served at Ra.  This is really the Rocky Pointe version you get at a number of places there or a strip buffet.  Didn't really appeal to me.  The tacos came after a really long wait which is unexpected when you order 'Street Tacos' as usually this dish comes fast. We did get the option to mix & match which we did. Fish, Carne Asada, baja chicken were my selections.  As I mentioned, the only thing street about them was the undersized corn tortilla they came on but the three of them filled an oversize plate so don't order these thinking you are saving room for a quick stop at The cheese cake factory on the way out.  Stick with the fish tacos- this was by far the best and on their own were the only real positive part of the dinner and pushed this review to 3 stars. I started with that one and the other two were just filler from there- plenty of it but not all that memorable. Still looking for a good street taco place- going to try Joy Ride next...."}
{"text":"This is the best americanized Mexican restaurant I've ever tried here in Phoenix. Been here twice already and they never failed me. The flavor of their food is so consistent.   Their crab and shrimp ceviche is to die for. Their shrimp fajita can serve up to 3 people. I tell you they're generous of their servings. Ohhh, and have i mentioned their chocolate cake??? OMG! The best chocolate cake I have tried in AZ.   Excellent service. Amazing food. What else can you ask for? I would definitely come back every time I crave for Mexican food"}
{"text":"Love this place! Very kid friendly in a trendy setting not a ton of kids running around however, it's loud enough & has kid friendly food no reason the parents should suffer at a chuckie cheese!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time couple of days ago. I was told that I must order their nachos for appetizer. I wasn't disappointed - the nachos were delish! Pieces of avocado on the nachos,yum, and great cheese and beans along with other toppings. Best nachos I've ever tasted. I ordered the cheese enchiladas. They weren't the best enchiladas I have ever had but they satisfied my craving for Mexican cuisine. The price was decent. About $9 -$12 per entree. Considering you are eating in downtown Scottsdale in a very upscale neighborhood-I was impressed. The atmosphere was very casual and hip. I think this is a great place to go hang out with friends. Loved the brown and blue motif. The service was bland. Our waiter did his job but didnt blow us out of the water. I think nowadays with the economy the way it is you have to take it up a notch on service. I have gotten the same kind of service at my neighborhood Taco Bell.  The manager at Blanco's should take notes on Fogo's wait staff which is superb.  Basically would recommend this place and would go back for those nachos!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place. Ty was a great server,  friendly and helpful. The salsa was spicy but so  good, and loved the tacos."}
{"text":"Good food, you spend about $45 per couple, little bit noisy.  They need a broader variety of soft drinks and real guacamole, but all and all it's a nice place."}
{"text":"I'm still feeling my regrets for coming into this place. What a joke.    My mom and I have this thing about Mexican food/tex-mex restaurants in the valley-we've eaten at most all of them. When we go out for lunch, we generally look for a new one to try in the area we plan on being in around that time. Unfortunately, this is the place we stumbled upon.    Our server seemed already \"put off\" by us for some reason..I'm blaming it on the fact that I was wearing something with a pattern so he automatically knew I must be one of those \"artistic\" types who like real food and not some shitty Mexican version of Fuddruckers. We were doomed from the start.     I'll save you the details just because even I'M annoyed by how annoyed I was with every interaction with my server. After looking over the menu, I decided that I wasn't that into anything and just wanted a burrito.   Word for word:   Me - Can I get a burrito, beans, rice and sour cream only.     Oh and can you grill it, or put it on your flat top?   Douche - WELL YEA THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT,....pFFFTttt, HOW ELSE DO YOU MAKE A BURRITO. WE ALWAYS MAKE THEM LIKE THAT   .... ...  ...   Me - Oh. I usually have to ask. Okaaay.   - Server puts in the order then comes back.   Douche - SO DO YOU WANT THAT ON THE FLAT TOP BECAUSE IT'LL FALL THROUGH ON THE GRILL.   Me - Yea that's fine.   Douche - LIKE TACO BELL   Me - Ok.   ...   inner monologue Me - LISTEN DICK, YOUR MENU ISN'T APPETIZING SO JUST GIVE ME A FUCKING TORTILLA  A BEAN AND SOME TOMATO SO I CAN HAVE A MEAL WITH MY MOM THAT DOESN'T REVOLVE AROUND YOU BEING AN ASSHOLE.   ehem..   Food came and I ate about a third of it before noticing little chunks of bacon in my burrito. THANK GOD I'm not a real vegetarian even though I say I am, I eat seafood and will try meat when I feel the quality of meat is on par with excellence at restaurants worthy of my money..    I also got the pleasure of witnessing about 11 plates of food up on the line for about 5 minutes, just sitting there while the servers folded silverware into napkins and talked about Carlos Mencia...or something equally as boring.   Needless to say, I reluctantly left a tip.      I walked away immediately feeling nauseous and thoroughly grossed out by the whole experience - now 24 hours later - I have a headache that won't go away, what feels like the stomach flu and an intense feeling that I can never enjoy a burrito again.    ..I hope the lack of interest in burrito's is a phase, Blanco, for your sake.   I'll never betray you again, Taco's Jalisco's."}
{"text":"This place is great. If you come on the weekend be prepared to wait if you don't have reservations. The food was delicious! The \"crisp\" appetizers are amazing. But the best part of the evening was our waiter, Saunders!! What an amazing young man!! So sweet and helpful and patient."}
{"text":"When I need a good mexican food \"fix\" and I'm at work, I go here. It is just down the road & it has always been good. I always get their chicken tacos. They hit the spot.  Plus, I gotta say, their chips & salsa are pretty delicious as well.  Yummy food!"}
{"text":"My friend Carrie and I decided to stop at Blanco on the way back from the Scottsdale Culinary Festival.  Yep, kinda ironic, we needed more food and drinks after a culinary festival.  I have been wanting to try the latest addition to the Borgata.  If you like good margaritas and good food than this place is perfect.  If you dont....you need help!  A great relaxing atmosphere on the patio with margaritas that go down....oh so smooth!! We tried one of their flat bread cheese crisp type appetizers which was a perfect compliment to my drink.  Is the drink supposed to compliment the food?? oops!  The chips and salsa were also good and add the guacamole for some extra flare!  Cool place, nice atmosphere, and good food to top it off!  Ill be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday dinner, the place was pretty big and pretty busy. Contemporary decor and very nice staff! Here's a bit of recap of what we had:  ~Chips & Salsa - 3 stars - decent and limitless! ~Crab & Shrimp Ceviche - 5 stars! I absolutely loved this! Very refreshing!! ~Grilled Fish Taco - 3 stars - nice presentation and good. ~Beef 'House Specialty' Enchilada - 1 star... the meat was way too salty, and I guess it was so special that just don't expect this to be your normal enchilada from anywhere...quite disappointed on this house special ~Tres Leche Cake - 3.5 stars - it was decent with some whipped cream and strawberries on top, but the cake wasn't so soaked and the cinnamon taste was too strong....  I'd visit again just for some chips and ceviche!!"}
{"text":"Near the top of my list for quality mexican food. The price is very fair as well ,being that they are located in Snottsdale. I always get the 3 chicken tacos (street tacos) when we go. I can't help it, they taste sooo good, I can't get myself to try anything else. The rice is outstanding, although they give you only about 2 teaspoons. When we crave mexican, we go to Blanco."}
{"text":"I was pretty fired up to go here, but was let down by the food. My shrimp tacos were decent, but nothing special. The tuna ceviche was more like tartar than ceviche. The chips were good, but the salsa was not very spicy. All and all, it was a bland meal."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places to go to now whenever I'm craving Mexican food! I recently took my mom and cousin here while they were in town visiting and we couldn't have had a better experience. The food was so delicious, even down to the complimentary chips that are hot when brought out. We were told to try the trio of dips that they offer during happy hour and let's just say I crave it everyday ever since. The queso and bean dip that comes with it is to die for and it was so cheap! Our server was also amazing and constantly checked up on us to see how we were doing. She made us feel like we were a regular at the restaurant and have known her for awhile. Overall, such a great experience and a really cute restaurant to go to. We will definitely be going back to enjoy the amazing food and service!"}
{"text":"This place has great food and service. When we came for the first time the waiter was so helpful and recommend some favorites. The atmosphere is really cool. The menu has a good selection and everything is made fresh. They make their own juices and salsa. I had a great overall experience and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Blanco is by far my favorite Sam Fox restaurant. It's about two minutes away from home, so my husband and I come here at least several times a month. The first thing I notice about Blanco is that every single time, we have good service. I definitley can't say this for some of the other Fox restaurants, but Blanco's staff does great everytime. Hostesses don't act snooty, servers are attentive and friendly, and even the bartenders are very nice. We have often been sat at tables near the bar, and the bartender has offered to refill drinks if our server wasn't around. The food is also amazing. I don't have super high standards for Mexican food, so I'm happy with the quality handmade guacamole and other regular menu item staples. I LOVE the happy hour at Blanco. Half off all appetizers and drinks. You can easily make a meal sharing appetizers, we usually get the guac, the steak quesadilla, and the chicken taquitos. All the margaritas I've tried have been good, but their blood orange marg is one of my favorites out of any mexican place. Would highly recommend. The food never disappoints and servers seem to actually care that you are enjoying yourselves."}
{"text":"Best tacos at the taco festival! I had their beef machaca tacos. Their home made tortillas and the delicious spicy machaca made them my favorites."}
{"text":"Mix and match tacos!   Pleasant ambiance for the most part, not a gaudy cantina knock off. Tip when ordering drinks: ask for the green salsa with the complement chips. Rich and smokey and tons better than red.  Tacos are pretty good, especially the steak which was actually grilled/seared rare!"}
{"text":"The food was okay and so were the drinks but my kids only picked at their food and there wasn't much in the way for them. The inside of the restaurant had a lot of monitors playing sports but club music was blasting and seemed to be in contrast with the setup if the restaurant. The menu is pricey, they layout is odd for a Mexican restaurant and this in combination with the okay food would make it someplace I wouldn't immediately recommend to a friend unless I had no other choice."}
{"text":"I have been to Blancos a couple times and have always had a good experience. The hostess' are always smiling and I was seated right away. The servers are all very nice and good at what they do. Now the food, It is Amazing! I have gotten the chicken tacos and they are delicious! The margarita's are great as well. The restaurant is clean and always full of patrons when I go there. Blanco's is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Scottsdale area! I will be coming back here again and again!"}
{"text":"My fiance took me here for lunch today and I was so mad that he didn't bring me here before this. THIS IS MY NEW FAVORITE RESTAURANT!! Usually I judge a Mexican restaurant by their salsa, but this is the exception. The salsa was good, but I like salty salsa.  I don't really like if it's the least bit sweet.  And I hate the real thick hard tortilla chips. This place had thick chips and the salsa was a bit sweet. But EVERYTHING else was mind blowingly good. I ordered the crispy shrimp tacos on corn tortillas with rice and pinto charro beans. OMG!! I've had hundreds of shrimp and fish tacos and these were the best I've ever had. And even though the rice was simple with just some cooked green onions and corn seasoning it...it was so incredible. It had a buttery succulent flavor to it. Ron had the beef short rib nachos and he was in heaven. They only serve Pepsi products here so I got the black passion fruit iced tea and it was amazing. I took some home with me. It's was a beautiful day and the open air layout of the place was gorgeous.  There are two patios, the place has 4 tvs for keeping up with the game.  I gave my compliments to the general manager, Chelsea and told her that we were destined to become good friends because this is my new place.  Great service, even better food and a lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"Where to start?  There were approximately 20 of us in our group, and we had called earlier in the week to make a reservation - since we knew it was a special occasion, a friends birthday, and we knew when, where, and approximately how many people would be there.    When we got there, they had given our tablyone sat down.  One of my friends was separated from the peoplee to an earlier birthday party who \"still hadn't left yet\"... and, by the looks of it, weren't planning on leaving any time soon.  Good for them, I wouldn't want them to rush, but the establishment should have planned a little better or figured that birthday parties/large groups would take longer.  That was frustrating, but they eventually sat us...  However, when we get to the table... the \"table\" is 4 spots too short... and the waiters are obviously irritated we are there.  Those of us that could, plopped down in a seat to get out of the way of the waiters... well, little did we know that was our \"seat\" for the rest of the night and we weren't to move.  They brought us another table or two to add on and ever in the group she knew - so everyone moved down so she could sit by people she knew.  This was while everyone was getting situated, drink orders were just being started, and WAY before we ordered food... however, one of the waiters decided to be a total prick about it and cause a scene about us \"moving\".  Well... if you would have counted how many guests there were and set up the table in the first place, we wouldn't be moving... you rushed us to get seated so we were out of your way - now you should just DEAL with one person moving.  Not to mention, making a scene made all of us uncomfortable.  I looked over the menu nothing looked particularly appealing (in fact, the menu is SOOOO unoriginal) - so I asked the waiter two questions - 1st, what the most popular dishes are, and 2nd, what he would order.  I took his suggestion and ordered the Combination Fajitas = Big mistake.  My steak was charred to the point where the \"char taste\" is all I could taste.  The shrimp was decent, but nothing spectacular.  The skillet that the meat came on was hot, but there was so much liquid on it that it didn't sizzle and the meat was luke warm (at best).  It came with white rice (yuck)...and black beans.  The black beans were the best part of this whole dish...and the sad part, is that they were just regular old black beans with a little cheese on top.  After I had tried to choke down 1 fajita, I decided I was done with the dish.  After everyone was done eating, the waiter came and asked me if I wanted a box.  He never asked me how my food was, how everything was tasting, if he could get me anything during my meal... just could he get me a box?!?!  Why would I want a box for burnt steak and cold shrimp??????  Not to mention, after I finished my greyhound, I ordered an ice tea - and after finishing my first (and only) ice tea - he never asked me if I wanted more or came around with another Tea - in fact, I couldn't get his attention to even ask for another ice tea!!!    I spent over 45.00 on a meal and a couple of drinks and I received about 1.00 worth of service and mediocre (at best) food.  With all the good options and unique restaurants in the valley - it's safe to say this place is crossed off of my \"list\" as far as places I will eat again."}
{"text":"Great sangria, cute causal ambiance, yummy salsa and great portions. What is there not to love!"}
{"text":"After spending 2 weeks on the border, eating authentic Mexican food we were hoping for one last hurrah at Blanco Taco at Sky Harbor Airport.  We had the chicken tortilla soup and the pork burrito enchilada style.  The food tasted more TexMex than Sonoran.  TexMex can be good too, but not when you're expecting Sonoran.  To be fair, the pork burrito was tasty and would have been much better without the thick, dark red sauce.  The soup had a thick, heavy broth with very little chicken.  Not worth the cost."}
{"text":"We love Mexican food and this place was very good food. I don't understand why it's ratings are not higher. The service was amazing. The food delicious. The berry monitor was awesome. I had the Mexican Chop salad was so good. I added the chicken and I has meat in almost every bite. I will come back :)"}
{"text":"Decor - A+  Food - Decent but not the best place in town.  The lowdown:  Skinny Margarita - Good, delicious.  Chips - Too thick - not a fan.  Salsa - Thoroughly enjoyed.  Guacamole - Just ok.  Needed salt and garlic.  Mine is better.    Braised Short Rib & Avocado Cheese Crisp - Ordered because of the 'rave' reviews on yelp.  It was ok but wouldn't have a craving to go back just for this.  Carne Asada Tacos - Dry, disappointed - meh  Pork Carnita Tacos - Good  Slow Cooked BBQ Pork Taco - Excellent, A+  Brown Sugar Carmel Flan - Amazeballs.  Tasted like Creme Brulee.  A must!  Tres Leche Cake - Wasn't a fan.  It was extremely dense.  Roundup - Not my favorite place for mexican food.  Would I go back?  Not sure.  I guess I got it off the check box for another Fox restaurant."}
{"text":"We ate at this restaurant on a Sunday evening.  We had to wait about 30 min for a table. It was worth the wait. The ambiance was cool with high ceilings, fire pits etc. I tried both the fish tacos and the mushroom tacos.  The fish tacos were great.  The blood orange margarita was tangy and tasty. We really enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"Went to Blanco for the first time and I enjoyed it. The chips and salsa were delicious. I had the nachos as well. They were great. The service itself wasn't that great. Our waiter did not check in on us often. I had to get him to place an order. I will go back again for the food and hopefully a better service experience from their staff."}
{"text":"I love this place! Eat here every time in Scottsdale. Great atmosphere and food. I always get the fajitas, blood orange margarita, and/or sangria. All are must try's!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS with their customer service.  My food was taking a long time to arrive so my server checked the status and told me it was being prepared.  While I figured the order had been overlooked, I wasn't worried.   But when the manager, Cricket, brought my food, she said my entire meal was comped.  Talk about making something right!  Kudos to them for their amazing customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"I just went to Blanco for the first time this past weekend and I was very pleased.  It was birthday so we had a large group. OUr waiter  answered all my questions and made some great recommendations. The food is pretty spicy, so make sure that what you're in the mood for before you go. The decor is very cool and modern. Thanks for a great birthday!!"}
{"text":"So.....Last night we were in the mood for margaritas and didn't want to travel too far from home.  Against our better judgement we decided to give Blanco another try.  Won't make this mistake again!!  The wait wasn't long, but the service was awful, the margarita bitter and the food....just not worth the price.  There was more shredded cabbage in our fish tacos than anything else!!  This place is just too much of a 'scene' for us too.  We might as well have been in LA.  Not a good experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner this evening to tryout one more time.  We had very good experience.  My grilled salmon was excellent and so was the chilly chicken enchilada dish for my wife. The wine and Mexican cake with ice cream were good too.  Service by our waiter Sergio was excellent.  Tony,(manager) told us that they have happy hour during summer from 3-6 every day.  I like their spicy salsa and chips."}
{"text":"This place was right by our hotel so we decided to try it. Starting with the positive, it's a beautiful restaurant great indoor/outdoor seating and great service. We definitely felt well taken care of.  My complaints, and why it only gets a 3-star from me is the food was just \"ok\". The best thing we had was the chips and salsa which were really good, but we all got different kinds of tacos and no one was really impressed. Everything was a little bland for supposed Mexican food. We all ended up pouring the decent enough salsa on our tacos to kick them up a notch.  Also, when we first arrived it was before happy hour and we all ordered a different specialty margarita and they were all really good. So on our next round we were informed that happy hour had begun and the Margs were now half price!! Great news right?! Unfortunately not, it seems half price = half the booze too :(  Personally, I hate a sweet under-boozed margarita I'd rather pay full price then drink that crap! My recommendation if you're there to enjoy happy hour prices is to ordered a beer."}
{"text":"Decided to come here because I work nearby and wanted a little something to snack on before going home. I missed happy hour, but was hoping to order an appetizer and be happy.   Two hostesses at the front, they seemed weirded out I was dining alone. Waited for about 15 minutes, then I was seated, at a rather large table for just myself. Waited another 10 minutes, and a hostess came over and asked if anyone had taken my order, I replied no.   She found a waiter, but he didn't seem excited to have just one patron.  I wasn't drinking, I told him I just wanted an app or two, he didn't seem thrilled knowing that he wouldn't get a huge tip without a drink on my tab, asked a few times if I wanted to know the drink specials, finally I told him I'm driving and can't. Other servers constantly ran past me, brushed up against me, and one even used my chair, yes the one I was sitting on, as an aid in running to the kitchen faster. Not sure if it was where I was sitting, the center of the room, but it was uncomfortable.   Food: Ordered the street corn appetizer and the quest blanco. Was a $6.50 tab, left $11, because I felt bad/ pressured for not ordering a drink. Good portion/quality for how cheap it was.   Overall 3 stars because of experience. It was THAT uncomfortable and awkward being the customer that college freshmen don't want to serve because they know it won't be \"worth it\". (I served tables, I get it)  Will go back but with more people probably."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service! Had the mole, grilled salmon, and ceviche. Everyone really enjoyed the food! The mole was a different presentation than you normally see but still very tasty. This was a great choice!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend the ceviche...flavor was very fishy.  Not well prepared.  Street corn and quesadilla starters were good."}
{"text":"We're from Southern California so we know good Mexican Food but this restaurant is by far the best we've had. Not only is the food amazing but the service and atmosphere made it all the more enjoyable. Our server, Paige, had some great recommendations which we would not have tried otherwise and we were so glad she took the time to go through the menu and make sure we were taken care of. Amazing service and great food, what more could you want? If you only have a short stay in the area we recommend you grab dinner here, we only wish they'd come to CA!"}
{"text":"I experienced this place for happy hour yesterday.   It was absolutely amazing? the food was delicious and the service was wonderful.   I will go back for sure. Our server may have been the best I've experienced in many years."}
{"text":"I'm not one to ever write reviews in fact this is my first ever writing one about a restaurant, however I felt this special occasion indeed deserved it. Myself and my family came into Blanco around 7pm on a Monday night not expecting it to be busy yet there was a 20 minute wait, no issue and they were very quick to seat us in a very packed restaurant. Now being avid Fox concept customers good service is expected, shortly after being seated our server Kareem came by and his initial attitude was awesome, we could tell he was slammed busy with many tables and lots of guests yet he never once failed to pay attention to detail to us or any other guest. Even the table behind us with five or six guests was joking with him and as he walked away one patron even pumped his fists laughing saying to his friends \"Man! I love this guy!\" Kareem was excellent and the service provide and his amazing attitude towards the night, to my family, and all his other guests was well worthy of my review and time to write it! The food was incredible and I would highly recommended this restaurant to all!"}
{"text":"First time coming here, husband and I were in the mood for Mexican and it popped up on restaurants close to us. The margaritas are amazing the food is delicious, it's a little bit expensive, but we really enjoyed our experience here."}
{"text":"I go to the taco window at this particular Blanco establishment at least once a week for lunch. The prices are great, the food is fresh and delicious, but the best part of the experience is interacting with the welcoming staff. I talk with the woman that has blonde hair and vibrant eyes every time I eat there, and our conversations are great! For the most part, I am a loyal customer to this particular Blanco mainly because of the phenomenal staff & the woman at the window. I would give this place a 5 star rating easily."}
{"text":"Amazing! This place never disappoints. The enchiladas are awesome! You really can't go wrong with any of them. They queso is pretty darn good also. Ask for the street corn as your side with your dish. I love everything about this place! The margaritas are great too! We go often and would definitely recommend for a casual meal that is constantly great and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Enchilada are amazing. Shrimp tacos are great as we'll. Cool atmosphere and nice wait staff. Will be back"}
{"text":"Both Food and service was amazing. We ordered the Nachos which several in my party said were the best they have ever had. I had the Burrito Enchilada style and it was delicious. I normally don't like rice but this was so flavorful that I ate all of it. Our chips/ salsa and water glass was never left empty. Waitress was attentive and efficient. Can not wait to return!"}
{"text":"Awesome Tacos, Salsa and street corn. Everything is made from scratch try the house margarita on the rocks. Went during dinner time dinner for two and drinks 40 dollars."}
{"text":"Great food,great servers. Nice indoor/outdoor concept. The patio out front is great with super comfortable patio chairs. Super busy even on week nights if they tell you it's an hour plus wait, it will be. The jalape√±o mango margaritas are great! As is the guacamole!! I had the award winning pork tacos and they were really good as well! A great experience."}
{"text":"I went to the Blanco Tacos in Tucson when it first opened, and really enjoyed it.  It was more of a casual eatery in a in the back of an upscale shopping center in North Tucson, so I was happy when I heard that one was opened in Scottsdale.  I have eaten at the Scottsdale location on several occasions, and kept putting off writing a review of it, simply because I didn't know what to make of it. Being in Scottsdale, this is, of course, not as casual or as relaxed place as the other.  The food is similar, but the atmosphere is quite different.  The decor is very chic, as are all Fox concept restaurants, and it was well accented with the natural wood and whitewashed ceiling.  They also have a nice outside patio.   The service varies. I have even had it change on me in the same meal.  We once had a shift change during our meal, - the first server couldn't have been more cheerful and attentive, and the second server was just the opposite.  Not rude or incompetent - just indifferent.   And speaking of indifferent, that is their food.  Nothing to rave about, and nothing to complain about.  I have had their entrees, and the best that can be said is that it is good, americanized  mexican food..  That is -  bland, and boring. It is a little pricier than similar mexican but this is the Borgata, so I am sure rent is a little higher.    So even though I like their decor and the people watching, I have little desire to go back for their food.  But I do like their chips, salsa and beer.  So when the better half is shopping, I get my exercise by walking to Blanco's and having their chips and salsa, and of course a the inevitable bottle (or two) of Dos Equis."}
{"text":"A little Disappointed 2nd time around. Ordered traditional carnitas, i felt like i was eating salt and grease. They Literally had no flavor excerpt for the salt! The  Waitress seem as if she had a million other things to do instead of work her shift. Just really disappointed in my visit."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Their tacos are to die for!  Everytime I go, I get the Carnitas, BBQ Pork and Short Rib tacos as a combo and I am not even a big fan of pork, or tacos!  Sooo delicious.  I am also a huge fan of their skinny margaritas.  I don't really like sweet drinks and these margaritas tickle my sour fancy!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Blanco on a Friday evening with my boss. We were immediately seated as it wasn't too busy. We ordered a drink and some guacamole and some queso. Since she had to catch a flight we decided to order everything at once.   I ordered my food and when the server asked which beans I asked which ones have bacon in them, told her I don't eat meat and then took the black beans (no bacon). I then ordered the CHEESE enchiladas. When she repeated the order she said I ordered the chicken enchiladas, I said no, I don't eat meat (again).   My bosses drink came and then the guac and queso. No chips and no drink for me. Our server came by again and said my drink was coming and started to walk away and I said, excuse me... can we get some chips and plates. \"oh yeah\" another 5 minutes later she returned with chips but informed us the plates were still in the dishwasher.   Our food arrived and still no cocktail, I asked her again to check on it. I then tasted my food and thought it tasted funny, I took another bite and asked my boss to do the same, she informed me it was a meat sauce. I flagged down the server and asked her if it was meat and she said I don't know, let me find out. REALLY!! As a side note, I have never had this much trouble at a Fox restaurant, they seem to be completely clued in and know their menu). She came back and apologized and offered me something else. She also said she would tell her manager. Never saw a manager.   I am shocked at the poor service at this restaurant. I enjoy True Food on a regular basis and they are so professional and are very knowledgeable about the menu. I am not sure I will be returning to Blanco.   Perhaps more training is necessary."}
{"text":"Street corn? How could I not know what it is and how delicious it is!! I'd stop in for just that and the guacamole, both are excellent!!  Atmosphere and service are top notch!!"}
{"text":"This is an update to my earlier complaint.  I am guessing management reads Yelp reviews, because I've made several trips to Blanco's over the Summer and can say that staff attentiveness is way up!  They were quick to take my order, bring the salsa and chips, and keep an eye on drink refills - all without being too overbearing.  It is once again a good place to hang out without having to worry about whether you'll get good service.  They could probably double the size of the bar and still keep the crowd from looking thin, but that's another issue.."}
{"text":"Overall, this place was pretty good. The cheese crisps are tasty and something unique to order - either as your meal or as an app (it 's like a medium sized pizza).   For my main dish I had shrimp tacos. I got them in a soft shell, though, and they were impossible to eat. Next time, I'd get a hard shell.   The service was a little sub-par."}
{"text":"We were looking for Mexican food today in Scottsdale and happened upon Blanco. Nice location, well-appointed, and adequately staffed. We came in well after lunch but before dinner - 'Linner.\" I got the fish tacos ($13) and my husband got a cheese enchilada ($10). I was served three tortillas no more than 3 inches in diameter with bits of chopped stuff and one piece of fish the size of my thumb in each. I'm a small person, so this was okay, but the fish was almost inedible. Awful stuff. My husband's enchilada was in a small iron skillet and had a sugary sauce. Disappointing. I couldn't get a regular iced tea either - they only had passion fruit and green hibiscus. I got a pomegranite/grapefruit margarita which was pretty good, but pretty light overall. If you were looking to party, you'd have to down several of these $9 concoctions to really feel it. Total bill, with tip, for this affair was just under $40.  Skip it if you're looking for a nice meal. If you're looking to hang out with friends, munch on some appetizers and drink, then it's sorta kinda okay."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple of times in the last month...once for dinner and once for lunch. Both times the food was very good - we especially liked the guacamole and chips ! I had the braised tacos for dinner and the green pork enchilada for lunch and would recommend either one. There is a very nice manager ( his name is Daniel ) that was so helpful and he stopped by to check on us a couple of times...it seemed like the wait staff enjoyed working with him and the place was high energy and fun !"}
{"text":"Good food & AMAZING service.  I believe that if a Mexican  restaurant has good salsa  its a good sign that the food will be good as well & Blanco has several. Our waiter Denver was spot on & made our \"date night\" extra special. We will certainly be back & definitely request Denver's section. Great job Blanco!"}
{"text":"Some of the best margaritas I've ever had. Even the simple 'classic' is dream-worthy.   Great chips and salsa to start.  Lots of vegetarian and fresher-fare options. The Mahi Mahi on greens was amazing, great flavor and perfectly done. Enchiladas are a bit heavy for a hot summer afternoon.  Genuine, kind service.  Another win for FRC."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican burrito/enchilada that I have ever had. It was quality beef, rice, and beans.. It was also fulfilling and more then enough. The burrito itself was huge! This will always be the first place on my mind when I want to eat delicious Mexican food."}
{"text":"I actually thought this place was gonna be pretty good but I wasn't a big fan their service is awful don't get me started on the food it's bad! I liked the bar erea it was ok"}
{"text":"As I write this review I wonder if I need to re-evaluate my rating system.  I find Blanco a solid \"average\", so why 4 stars instead of 3?  I honestly couldn't tell you, except for the fact that I find myself going here so ofter for simple, clean, consistent food, that they MUST be more than 3 stars.  Right??"}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but you have to admit that these Fox Concept restaurants do a not too shabby job of putting together good food and drinks in a well-decorated venue.  Clearly this is not authentic Mexican food, but just because it's not authentic doesn't mean the food can't be tasty. My mother and I will share the fajitas, which is just the perfect size for us to spilt when we aren't super hungry. I love getting the discounted Fox Restaurant gift cards at Costco to eat here.  Their margarita menu is also good. I had the blood orange one and I can't knock it.  It's a great place to meet up with friends over casual conversation."}
{"text":"Unexpected. Went here because it was across the street from the Hilton where we were staying. Ordered the Mexican street corn ($3) and the Chicken Mole. Both were bold and delicious.  Would recommend to folks visiting Scottsdale for sure."}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant, waited 45 minutes without a reservation. Decided to get food to go. Bartenders and hostess were great, even gave us a free drink for our long wait. Took our food back to the hotel and enjoyed it. We'll give this place another go next time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Another Fox hit!! The new happy hour menu is amazing. Their classic margarita is the perfect match to any of their menu choices. I'm favorable to the ceviche and any of their tacos... Yes, ALL of the tacos are great! They are tiny street tacos but I'm a fan of variety, so they work perfectly with my appetite.   Go eat at the bar, if you can find a spot. The service there is incredible and always on point. The indoor/outdoor feel is also a plus.    I WILL be back."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and went back twice for drinks since it was within walking distance of the hotel. Food was very good and the staff is super accommodating! The blood orange margarita was definitely a favorite."}
{"text":"Taco Blanco's staff really goes out of their way to welcome our family each and every time we visit. The food is consistently fantastic. My favorite things range from the delicious taco platters with freshly baked flower tortillas to the margaritas. The classic margarita with the three generation tequila is superb. Great restaurant to have in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"we were recommended this restaurant by the hotel staff.  A great place for good, seasoned, quality Mexican food.  Nice atmosphere.  The service is a titch slow, but the food makes up for it.  Amazing guac.  Carnitas tacos are amazing.  Skinny Margarita is great."}
{"text":"Yumm. You can mix and match your tacos with chicken, beef , pork, mushrooms, you name it ... the selection is good. The chips, salsa and guacamole are a delight.  I prefer the roasted chicken tacos.  Everytime I've visited this location, the service has always been great, the food is always fresh and there is no long wait time.    It's my go to for mexican food."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal or service yet and we've eaten here 6 or 7 times.  The guacamole is good. The cheese quesadilla, corn, short rib/avocado crisp, carne asada taco, short rib taco are all delicious.  The queso blanco seems to be made with processed cheese but I loved the flavor and texture so I didn't let that bother me.  Chips and salsa are tasty too as are the rice and black beans.  They have two outdoor seating areas which are really nice (unfortunately the noisy construction next door kind of ruins the patio on that side).  Inside is big and open with TV's that can be seen from every table.  Service has always been great, I've never found myself looking around for my server.  I dread the day the beautiful Borgata has been replaced with the 218 unit condo complex that will then overshadow this nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Chips were extremely salty.  Fish tacos were bland.  Nice atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"My husband and I are new to the area and after some friends recommended Blanco Tacos & Tequila we were excited to try a new place and the fact that they have gluten free options was a HUGE plus.  We met our friends last Saturday for dinner, I asked the hostess if they had a gluten free menu and she stated that most items on the menu are gluten free and be sure to tell our server and request the gluten free chips.  After being seated, I requested from our server GF chips and was told that were out that day, I thought he was joking but he was not, feeling disappointed we placed our order and when our food arrived my husband had requested flour tortillas with his street tacos and received corn, when my husband told the server he said they could send them back but as the rest of us had our food and he didn't want to wait for them to be redone the server stated that he would provide a complimentary desert. While eating our meal about half way through my cheese enchiladas I realized that I had been glutened, as I have celiac and it is always risky eating out.  We received our check and waited for the server to return with the desert and that didn't happen.  Since I was not feeling well, we decided to leave, not a good first impression.   This is a popular place and very loud.  Be cautious if looking for gluten free options."}
{"text":"This place is seriously overrated. Chips and salsa were horrible by standards of other Mexican restaurants located near by. The cheese crisp had hardly any cheese on it! Seating was catastrophic, had to wait 40mins when I could visibly see 10 tables open and set. This place was also like douche-bag central! Just reminds me of the Scottsdale Bars song!  If you wanna spend this much cash and get better food and drinks, go to the mission in old town Scottsdale!  On a good note however, once seated we did receive good service!"}
{"text":"Food: mostly tasty. Although inconsistent (sometimes too salty or sweet). Drinks: good selection Service: mostly good, quick, and friendly. Unless it gets pretty busy (lunchtime and dinner).  Atmosphere: loud and obnoxious Scottsdale crowds (can't have a conversation at your table without shouting at each other). **tip: avoid dinner time. Unless you're that type of person (loud & obnoxious). Another poster mentioned something about it being \"douchebag central\". LOL Sometimes, it can be.  Value/pricing: fair to overpriced (some items)  Parking: can be a pain in the rear, if you go during peak hours. Valet, if you can.  If you're health conscious and want to eat something light, I recommend their delicious *grilled shrimp salad. Mmmm... So good, I had to dissect and figure out all the ingredients so I could make it for myself at home! ¬†:-)  I had their flan for dessert, once- it was too sweet and soft (for my taste). I make a way better flan than that!  Overall, not a bad option for some semi-authentic, modern \"Mexican inspired\" food fare. Will not go out of my way to go eat there, but if I'm in the area, or someone invites, it could be an option to stop in and get a bite."}
{"text":"Great place! Made me feel like I was on vacation with the ambience. It was our first time there on a Friday afternoon. We had the best server named Juliet! She was amazing. She was so helpful, answered all our questions and was so attentive. We ordered the guacamole, which was so yummy. I ordered the shrimp tacos, which were outstanding! The shrimp were huge, couldn't even close my taco. Can't wait to go back just for those. I also got a Italian blood orange margarita which was good but too sweet to have several, I then switched to a red Sangria, that was really good. We then topped off our amazing lunch with tres leches Cake. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Tasty grab & go food window and patio on the east side of blanco. Modern Mexican with NO relation to the fast food -bertos or cheesy blandness of most sit down places.  They have a small selection of guacamole, tacos, quesadillas, and snacks.  Very tasty but expensive for the size.  I like the fact they have a cook make it once you order it so it comes out piping hot!  The salsa has a kick made with fresh chilis and ingredients.  My go to is usually 2 chicken tacos and a guacamole.  The quesadilla is straightforward but done properly with the slightly crispy tortilla and evenly melted gooey white cheese.  By far the best thing here is the rotating agua frescas.  The girls at work and I constantly check if they have strawberry agua fresca.  These are made with fresh strained and muddled strawberries and no added sugar.  We have asked so many times if they add sugar and they always insist no.  I've had the raspberry lemon, lime, and peach and they all are true to the fruit.  The people working are usually nice and Greer and Nathan have helped me before with a smile.  The cook even started my order when I stepped up while the window person was away."}
{"text":"How is this listed as vegetarian? I didn't really see many vegetarian options on the menu. 45 minute wait on a Saturday night. My friend and I walked in and put our name down. Once they seated us we found out they thought we were 3 people. Not sure how that happened and if that made us wait longer.  I had the grilled salmon. The salmon itself was alright, but I was disappointed to find out their \"roasted yukon hash\" contained bacon. That would be really shitty for people who can't eat pork. The Chayote and sweet peppers were also part of the hash, which I was not expecting. I thought I'd get some hearty cubes of chayote and a bed of spinach. Hardly any vegetables here.  Also the water tasted like bleach. What's up with that?"}
{"text":"Had a huge party. Server was attentive, kept drinks full, and separated checks w/out asking. I don't normally get this good of service with a small party, let alone one of 25."}
{"text":"The best way to describe Blanco Tacos without the risk of insult is to say it is a white boys Mexican restaurant. The food was lacking in flavor and very dry. We started with the Nachos con queso with short ribs, and the meat was tasty, but everything was wrong. There was no sauce on it only black beans, chunks of bland cheese pretending to be crema fresca, and a few cubes of avocados.   Two minutes after the Nachos arrived our entrees were delivered. I ordered the tacos believing if it's in the name of the restaurant they must be good, boy was I wrong. I ordered two traditional carnitas tacos, and one crispy shrimp taco. I had to doctor up both versions by adding tomatillo salsa and limes. The carnitas was very bland and lukewarm. Rubio's had a much better discontinued carnitas taco. The crispy shrimp taco wasn't crispy at all, it tasted like reheated frozen shrimp you buy at a grocery store. It came with pickled onions and Fresno chili, both flavorless. And sadly on the way home the shrimp wanted one last chance at freedom and erupted all over the side of the road.   My boyfriend ordered the Green Chili Pork burrito enchilada style (smothered in green sauce, which oddly enough wasn't even green) he wasn't impressed at all with the overall appearance/taste/experience. Not to mention, the rice is actually a sweet corn rice mix which they failed to list on the menu, and the Charro beans tasted like dirt.   I gave them One last chance to seduce me by ordering the sopapillas with local honey. Sadly, they were dense and stacked like a dessert jenga, so you have to use your fingers to catch them as they topple over with every try.   In my opinion I would bypass this restaurant and go to Filibertos, it's honestly much more of a decent Mexican restaurant then Blancos will ever be."}
{"text":"Food was great but the service was amazing!!  The happy hour deals fit the budget and the Margaritas were great!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of 8 or 10 people.  The service was pretty good. It took a while to get my second drink. The food was ok. I had the \"house specialty\" beef short rib enchiladas. The guacamole we had as an app was very lumpy and the blood orange margarita was too sweet."}
{"text":"It was my third time going to Blanco and always a great experience, service and food was fast and excellent. Highly recommended if you're looking for a relaxing lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"There are a lot of tex/mex places in Scottsdale for sure however, every time I visit Blanco it is a great value and experience. The portions are just right and they have TV's to see sports too."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here one Friday afternoon for the happy hour.  We sat out on the patio and the service was quite slow.  We waited about 15 minutes before a server came over to us.  The happy hour margarita was just OK, after two I didn't even feel a buzz which makes you wonder how much tequila they actually put in the happy hour margarita vs. a margarita from the regular menu. The server brought us chips and salsa with our drinks but forgot our waters.  We also ordered the queso dip and a chicken and cheese quesadilla.  The portion of queso dip was quite small and the server didn't bring any chips with the queso dip so we had to ask for them.  The chicken and cheese quesadilla was very pale color, like it had been microwaved and the chicken was sparse and dark meat.  We were very disappointed and won't be going back here again."}
{"text":"Food is really good! So many options and great quality. The guacamole is amazing!  Downside is that the staff is slow and difficult. The staff is not accommodating. The hostesses are rude and vacant. It was very noisy from the open kitchen."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican Restaurant, hands down!! We LOVE the manager, Justin Willie! He is very friendly & helpful every single time we come in!! So happy to hear he is back at this location! I am obsessed with the mushroom tacos & white peach & hibiscus Margarita! The happy hour is just fabulous!"}
{"text":"Service was great wish I could say the same about the food.  The salsa was bla.  The food had no flavor.  The server claimed the menu items are authentic Mexican food, not even close.  I have to eat crow and edit my review.  I forgot I had the flan. It was amazing I couldn't stop eating it so I am changing my post to 3*.  Sorry guys I wouldn't go back though!"}
{"text":"I visited this place with my mother while on vacation over three years ago - and we are STILL talking about it!  We stayed at the Cottonwood Resort, which is walking distance to Blanco.  EXCELLENT Happy Hour specials, DELICIOUS Mexican food, PERFECT margaritas and an absolutely AMAZING waitstaff.  If you find yourself in the Scottsdale area, this is a place that cannot be missed in my opinion."}
{"text":"2/5/17 Loved this place would return if I was in Scottsdale again!  The chips and salsa, short braised rib nachos all to die for. We were there for a late lunch on a Sunday, we sat outside great weather  The only thing we didn't like was the flan dessert. Service was good, servers were friendly and the food was GREAT.   Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical about this place because of the name - I thought just another taco joint. Boy was I wrong.  The carnitas tacos were nothing lie I expected, they were better!  Sometimes the beans or rice is a little undercooked and crunchy at other places.  But they were perfectly cooked!  The head chef was always checking on every dish that went out to be sure they were done right.  The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the wait staff.  Mostly millennials, a bit ditsy, mindless, and not very organized when ordering or delivering the food.  Great atmosphere, lots of seating choices including a patio where we ate in December.  Oh, and for dessert, I tried the tres leches - to die for!,"}
{"text":"Expensive for tiny portions and service was terrible. Host seemed displeased with my presence, will not be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here twice in the last two weeks. On both occasions, we were greeted promptly and with great enthusiasm by our server Dyana who provided the best care and service we've ever had. Furthermore,  manager Marlo stopped by to check on us and provided amazing customer service. On our second visit, we asked for Dyana and not only did she remember our names she remembered our order from our first visit. Marlo stopped by again, and without missing a step continued off from where we'd left off a week prior. Food was amazing both times and everything was clean and spotless. Bathrooms are downstairs, limiting bathroom traffic where you're eating and they were super clean! I would recommend this location to anyone, any time. Looking forward to our next visit and ready to try a mix and match taco combo!"}
{"text":"We've been searching for our go-to Mexican place... not too far away, priced well, nice atmosphere and of course, great food. After trying a lot of places in the Scottsdale area, Blanco checks all the boxes. This place is top notch for affordable, yet delicious and unique Mexican food. Been there twice so far and can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Update: Their manager reached out to me directly, was very gracious, and wanted to make this right. Therefore I can forgive what happened, recommend people give them a shot, and I will try them again in the future. ---------  I feel so ripped off :(  Such a disappointing meal. The service was good, as was the chips and salsa.  But both entrees were truly horrible. The cheese crisp was served well below room temperature.  It was overly crisp and dry, with very little cheese, which had hardened before it was even served. Gross. Never knew you could mess up a cheese crisp, but sadly they did.   We also had an order of 3 tacos. Fish tacos, which usually are very enjoyable when I've had them elsewhere, we're a big disaster this time. They had an overwhelming taste of charred fish and kerosene. We had to drown them in salsa to make them close to palatable, but we still left 1 behind. Overall I am a fan of Fox restaurants, and Mexican food, but this place missed the mark by a mile). We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! We had 6 different tacos between the two of us and they were all delicious! Hibiscus margarita is fantastic! Noise level is high. Wait time 40 minutes but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Blanco's about 6 times in the past year.  Generally the food is good, and there are some dishes that are better than others.  The chopped salad is very good, the Green chili Pork Enchiladas and very good, the chips, when warm are better than most, and I have had several Tacos' that are great.  I like the atmosphere, and the d√©cor of the building.  It is a shame that J. Alexander's closed next door, as that take some energy and ambiance from Blanco's.  My chief complaint is the seating/reservations system (or lack there-of).  Generally, there are about 4 young ladies who stand around the hostess stand, taking names, seating people, etc.  It seems that there are about 2 too many.  There seems to be no-one in charge and looks very hap hazard.  Two visits ago, we called ahead to check the wait, and they told us they could take our name, and as we were 10 minutes away, it would only be about another 10 minute wait once we got there.  When we got there, it seemed our name was added then, and we waited 30 minutes.  We were made to feel that they were not honest with us.  We had dinner here over the weekend, and had another issue with getting seated.  We arrived and there was only one couple seated in the wait area.  We put our name in, and said first available.  We were told 10 minutes.  There were several open tables, both in and out.  We had requested not to sit at a tall table, as we had someone who could not do that.  There were 4 of us.  As we are sitting there, and it is now going on 20 minutes, we see a couple being seated at an outside table for four.  Then another couple who was seated at a high table.  Both couple came in after we did.  When I questioned the hostess about this, she told me that the couple seated outside had requested outside seating.  When I asked her why \"first available\" did not beat an outside request, she said she was sorry, but had seated them first.  She then found us a table to sit at.  I am not sure how long we would have waited, and how many people would have been seated had I not spoken with her.  It was just a poor start to a meal, and we had brought guests to experience the restaurant.   I have eaten at many other Fox concept restaurants and find them excellent experience.  Blanco is just not where it used to be, and with all the other choices for restaurants in Scottsdale, not the best choice anymore."}
{"text":"Good Guac (not great but good) chips were a bit thick. Portions are decent for an airport eatery."}
{"text":"Worst night out to dinner and worst service we've had in many years. Food = alright. Service = horrible. It started out with a parking lot that didn't have enough room for parking - on a Monday...I was forced into valet parking which was ok but totally ridiculous on a Monday night. We were seated right away and then we waited and waited  and waited for a waitress. She finally came over and was friendly enough but seemed overwhelmed by her customer base. We ordered drinks right away and an appetizer. The guacamole came out right away and was pretty good. Then we waited, and waited, and waited for our drinks. We ordered a second appetizer (queso) and received it before our drinks came. Only one problem - no chips. So again, we waited and waited and waited for chips.   **We considered leaving before ordering dinner and wished we would have.**   Our drinks finally came out and we ordered dinner and finally got some chips. Then AGAIN, we waited, and waited - you get the drill. Our waitress avoided eye contact and she spent half of her time at the computer doing who knows what. No manager to be seen anywhere - no idea who was running this place. Food arrived and it was alright, nothing special. The service was so bad we will without a doubt never be back.   The valet parking attendant was the highlight of our night - nice, fast and courteous - even if it was unnecessary - like the horrible service we received at the restaurant. My advice - go to a local Mexican food restaurant - skip this place.  Updated 5/5: Owner sent me a private note about my experience. Classy move and much appreciated. Apologized and said they were going to look into the issues. Thank you."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, nice drink selection, attentive and knowledgeable staff. Would have been a 5 star experience if the music had not been so loud. Could seriously not carry on a conversation with a person sitting 24 imches from me. When told, our waitress was able to get the music turned down enough that we could talk. While iIwill most certainly return for the great food and service I may try a non-weekend evening to see if the sound is better. I recommend the Pork Green Chile Burrito and Enchiladas. Guacamole was top notch as well."}
{"text":"You don't go to Blanco Tacos if you are looking for Outstanding Mexican food, the menu is limited and arguably, there are places that are a lot better..  The food is just average but the atmosphere and ambiance is worth going for.   This is a very hip (club type atmosphere) restaurant.  We sat on the patio and it was great for people watching.  Good music too.    If I had one complaint, it would be the service.  Our server was preoccupied and kept forgetting to bring things."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype! The service was horrendous from the hostess to the waitresses to the timing of half our parties food coming out with the other half out at least 15 mins later. Our waitress should not be in a customer-facing role. She didn't seem to like people very much and seemed annoyed that we were there and that we wanted her to take our dinner order. Definitely not in a hurry to return anytime soon. Many other places with better food and much better service.   PROS 1. Very good margarita 2. Nice decor/atmosphere 3. Good music  CONS 1. Worst (rude, super slow, unhelpful) service I've had in as long as I can remember."}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to trying this place, Ambiance and staff members Awesome!! Loved the decor, food not so great I wish the taste was there specially carne asada tacos, meat was chewy-dry, tortillas cold, & if you are having tacos cilantro and onions are a must! with a choice of salsas....corn not to what I expected, guacamole needed some lemon salt & pepper. Salsa for chips needs more flavor. I must say, was a bit disappointed on the food but place is great to relax and have fun.  Moving on to try the other restaurants from Fox concepts."}
{"text":"Food was on point and service was friendly. My favorite part of the meal was the Mexican chocolate cake. Dessert prices were reasonable compared to other places and this cake is a must have for chocolate lovers."}
{"text":"Good: Customer service is good! The service is really fast. The decoration and the place is pretty  Cons;  The food is just okay but overpriced in my opinion for what you get. Margaritas were not good."}
{"text":"The Blanco rapido window. Can't be counted on for when they are open our closed. They just randomly close when they feel like it. Give me a break."}
{"text":"Great casual place! My wife and i went here on a recent trip to scottsdale. Liked the food so much we went back twice. Servers are a little green but they were nice enough and attentive. Recommended."}
{"text":"Found this place clear back in like 2010. I had the BEST fish tacos EVER! This place was never far from my mind when I had fish tacos other places. I finally went back to Scottsdale 6 years later and BEGGED my boyfriend to bring me here. Once he tried it he knew what I was talking about! Now this is out go to place any time we are in town. Everything we tried on the menu was awesome...and the sangria.. service is good and servers are friendly. My boyfriend is super picky and they made his food to order without getting annoyed with him..huge plus! Don't miss out on this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tacos are amazing ! Iced tea is mouth watering! I highly recommend!!  Their prices are right where it should be. It gets very busy so I highly recommend calling ahead!"}
{"text":"Love it.  I do think this location could use a little more work than the Scottsdale location.  Seems like these people are a little burnt out.  I'd recommend the enchilada's with the street corn...great combination!  Chips and salsa are on point - make sure to ask for the spicy salsa as well as the original."}
{"text":"Real good.  Do yourself a favor and get the house specialty enchilada's and sub the corn for the rice.  You won't be disappointed.  Service is good as well, they have very good morale for as many folks as are working there.  I seriously have eaten here 8 times in the last 30 days; I bring all of my out of town work folks."}
{"text":"Good food-a little expensive for lunch. Enchilada was delicious but too much to eat. Nice atmosphere, easy parking. Staff was nice, but forgot to refill drinks when they were empty."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday after work after passing by the place several times. The weather was beautiful to sit on the patio which was full. Sat at the bar.  Was acknowledge in a timely fashion with chips and salsa...had the pomegranate and grapefruit margarita which was OK...tasted like lemonade...will have to go back to try the food but overall...OK"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and I was craving some delicious Mexican food!  The reason for the three stars is twofold. One, because as soon as we walked in we were not greeted by the hostess. We came in on a Sunday evening and it was really slow. When she sat us down she did not engage in any conversation or even look at us. She was actually looking at the other hostess and having a conversation from a distance. She was completely rude. Second, the rice wasn't good at all.  Our server was very nice and attentive so she made up for the first impression we got when coming in. We order the queso blanco to start which is only $3 and delicious! I definitely recommend the queso. The chips and salsa were also delicious! For food, I ordered the grilled shrimp, fried shrimp, and Baja chicken. Both of the shrimp tacos were amazinggg! The Baja chicken was just okay, I've had better at a taco truck. The charro beans were also pretty good and as I said earlier the rice was mediocre.  When we were leaving the hostesses we're still talking to each other and as we were already out the door she said to have a good night. But she already left a bad taste in my mouth, so I didn't even acknowledge her.  This restaurant has a nice ambience and is very clean. For my first impression it was okay and the food was pretty good, but I don't think I'd made the 30 minute or the way drive again. I would come back if it was convenient."}
{"text":"The staff made our lunch  a lot of fun. Great tacos, fantastic Margaritas. Fun location to shop around at after lunch."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and people! The food was amazing and I would definitely go again. The food came out hot and fast which was much appreciated. And the margarita's were wonderful as well"}
{"text":"My go to Mexican place. Great drinks and the green chile pork burrito is amazing. Get it smothered in red chile and cheese and enjoy. The service is straight to the point, which I appreciate. And it's open later than most restaurants."}
{"text":"Skinny margaritas good, quac and chips great, hostesses cute and very efficient, but our server Jack was not very interested in good service."}
{"text":"CHAOS! Unbelievably crowded.  Poor management of the bar and waiting areas.  No visible sign of managers keeping order.  No place for locals to come.  When summer roles around,  we'll be at those places that were better managed during tourist time.  Gave up and took carry out home.  Had to ask if food was done as no one seemed to be managing carry out. Food had been done for while and sitting in window.  Cold when we got it and even colder when we got it home.    3 stars is generous."}
{"text":"Service was okay, but the food and drinks made it a return destination spot! Clean and overall pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Good, quality place. The service was friendly and helpful. The food is fresh and flavorful.  Tacos were great, salad was great (big)! We got just a \"side\" of quest for $4 which is a cup of melted cheese...it's probably worth getting the $10 version for all the fixin's.  Be ready...the carrots and jalape√±os is spicy!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and even better service!! Anne was great, very attentive and helpful with informing one of the girls in our group about the GF options."}
{"text":"Terrible management. How my party and I was treated by the manager (Harry) made me never want to come back. I cannot believe that they treat their guests in the manner that we were treated. I would go into detail but then I would be ranting for a whole page. However, our server was amazing but the manager is the one who sets the vibe of the whole restaurant. 10/10 will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had a very nice experience here. Try the blood orange Margarita, its outstanding.  Cool location, friendly attentive service, tasty food and fair prices. I tried the Guacamole (YUM), the fajitas & the Tres leches cake (DOUBLE YUM) It is definitely not your typical mexican food, but that is what I liked about this place. Check it out if your in the neighborhood. And did I mention to try the blood orange Marg? Mmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I drive by Blanco's pretty regularly and I always notice it. I'm not sure if it's the brightly colored signage or the world \"Tequila\" that grabs my attention but I always think that it's a place I'd like to try.   Tonight, I went for it.   The hostess was friendly, greeted us right away and sat us right in front of the tv that was playing the 49er game. Was it our San Francisco gear that gave us away?   Our waiter was nice, although I don't think he likes kids in his every day life, he handled it well. He was prompt on refills, checking in with us often, even giving us great recommendations. We all loved the food, many smiles all around.     I was glad we chose Blanco's for dinner tonight, it was everything I hoped it would be. Next time, I'm trying one of their margaritas. :)"}
{"text":"Went here w/ a group of ladies for lunch. Free chips/salsa are provided and the ladies ordered their blanco queso, which was just OK.  I had the shrimp/crab ceviche which was amazing! I tried my friend's street corn, which was also very yummy!  A couple things on our order came out wrong,  but the waitress was nice and quick to make it right."}
{"text":"I stopped by here to meet a buddy for lunch.  Its in a trendy and beautiful space in the Biltmore area.  There are quite a few of good dining options in the area, with Cheesecake factory around the corner, ZinBurger and TruFood in the area.  This place is ok.  Nothing special, but not bad either.  Its a Fox Concept restaurant, so the place is decorated nicely and it's always busy with people walking around, cause there are shopping malls in the area.  The customer service was good, no complaints there, the server constantly filled our drinks and brought out extra salsa's for us.  We ordered our lunch and the food literally came out within 5 minutes.  Very speedy service.  I ordered the short rib burrito with rice and sweet corn and my buddy ordered 3 tacos and beans, with corn on the side.  We both enjoyed our dishes and thought it was flavorful.  We also enjoyed the chips and salsa they they provide with your meal.  Our lunch tab came about to 37 bucks, which is pretty expensive for a mid week lunch.  I thought the prices were a little high for the burrito that I ordered.  Overall, I would give it a 3 star review.  I probably would go again if someone wanted to go, but probably wouldn't go out of my way just to eat here.  Its a very competitive market for Mexican food in the valley and I just don't think Blanco Tacos holds up, especially with their expensive prices."}
{"text":"I have been to previous locations, but I love this location in particular! My boyfriend and I spilt a margarita and carne asada burrito.  Not only did we enjoy the food but the atmosphere was lively and welcoming. I will make sure to come here again!"}
{"text":"We walked from the Andaz to Blanco for dinner one night.  The food was delicious and the staff friendly and welcoming.  Of course we started with margarita's, they brought chips and salsa to the table right away and we added an order of their street corn, which is roasted corn with queso cheese, it was so good.  Mr. Bee ordered enchiladas and I had the 3 street taco platter.  The enchiladas were yummy and have a southwest flair. They aren't your typical enchiladas, it is more of an enchilada stack or layered enchiladas. The street taco platter was awesome.  You can mix and match tacos, they don't have to be the same.  I tried two avocado tacos and a short rib taco,  all were amazing.  I wish we had a Blanco Tacos and Tequila close to home."}
{"text":"Nate' customer service/integrity is represented and managed with a golden revere. Talk about making lemon aid from lemons or turning nickel into platinum (pretty much, that's what happened).   Thank you Nate, I wrote an edited review, seems it didn't go through. Was much longer than this one.  I appreciate your work ethics and operation,  Lotus G."}
{"text":"1) The pomagranate/grapefruit margarita.  Pink grapefruit cuts the sweetness of the pom perfectly.  2) Camarones Taco was delicious.  Shrimp had a tasty chipotle sauce (ok, I'm pretty sure it was chipotle).  3) Delicious chips and salsa.  Fast service on the patio at rush hour.  Misting jets to keep it cool."}
{"text":"Had a business meeting here today. The food, service and atmosphere was top notch. I'm not sure what took me so long to try it. It doesn't matter what type of burrito you order, make sure you add the red enchilada sauce. To die for."}
{"text":"Wow! Blanco Taco is awesome!  The Pro Athlete Chamber of Commerce had its first chapter meeting here and Cricket the general manager treated us like royalty.   The downstairs party room they have is amazing.  The staff is excellent.  Food was delicious.   2 big thumbs up for this establishment!"}
{"text":"The quality of this place has gone downhill over the last few months. I used to be a constant patron but today is my last time visiting.  The tortas were disappointing again. The service is very slow no matter if it's 2:30 in the afternoon or 5:30. Not impressed and not returning again."}
{"text":"Its a pretty cool restaurant to hang out at.  My tacos were good and my margarita was tasty!  Service was good and the ambiance was lively and fun."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! Calvin is an amazing waiter and so nice!! I recommend ordering the queso dip! They give you free chips and salsa that is amazing! You gotta come here!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance but horrible service. The food was good but not exceptional. Our drinks were empty more often than not.  We were served guacamole without chips for at least 15 min, and only given one silverware roll for two people. We asked for another and the girl nodded and never came back. We're not going back."}
{"text":"He may not know it yet but Sanders is my new bff!!! Ok maybe not Bff but very close  this place is great!! I'm not Scottsdale fancy but was welcomed with open arms by a wonderful bartender/tequila & taco connoisseur. Come here!! Just let Sanders take care of you! Best margarita-fantastic tacos! The one I asked Sanders to build was better than my-I know everything taco but mine was still tasty for sure!  Excellent value for your money. We're visiting for a few weeks and I'm pretty sure I'll eat 80% of lunches and 40% of dinners here. Good stuff highly recommend thanks y'all!"}
{"text":"Always great service. Food is generally pretty good nothing phenomenal, but good.  Atmosphere is great.  Nice outdoor seating if it's not too hot."}
{"text":"Went here very late Friday night after picking up a friend from the airport in town from SF. We sat on the patio, but I noticed the interior was v. cool and the bar was massive. Although we were here for late dinner, I can't wait to go back for happy hour sometime. The margaritas were incredible - I tried the blood orange and my friend had some kind of pomegranate-something-something. They were both fantastic, and the tequila list was strong which is a big plus in my book. The drink list was refreshingly innovative and unique. Even the chips and salsa are worthy of mention. It's been a while since I've had guac near as tasty as at Blanco. We both had different varieties of tacos which I thought were outstanding. I usually consider the accompanying rice and beans as filler which I almost always pass over to save room for more booze, but not this time. The only complaint I had was the patio seating wasn't very good for eating - great for drinks and socializing, but we were posed in a constant hunch the entire time as we sucked down our food.  The patio seating does have couches and comfy chairs which are perfect for the happy hour setting. The place also seems to attract a fun, vibrant crowd. It probably goes without saying, as I'm certain I'm the only r'tard who would choose to eat outdoors in Scottsdale right now, but definitely eat at the bar or the in the dining room."}
{"text":"Great service, cool ambience and tasty food! It may not be too authentic mexican but their style, blend of flavors and creativity of menu offered is great. Must try dessert- Flan, yumm! Love the enchiladas, fajitas(done differently than most places- veg fajitas come with small diced veggies instead of long cut ones and small tortillas)  Be prepared for atleast half an hour wait over the weekend, they dont take reservations."}
{"text":"Our experience here was AMAZING!!!  For starters, we had great service! The waitress knew the menu and was able to answer our questions with confidence. She was very attentive and prompt.   We ordered: -Mango jalape√±o margarita, it was so so and not spicy. The sparkling Sangria was like club soda and juice bleh. -Appetizer - Braised beef cheese crisp with avocado - OMG so good!!! I don't have words. Wish I didn't have to share! -Entree's  - Braised short rib enchiladas with all rice, so much meat and so delectable. I do wish they topped it with shredded lettuce to add a cool and crisp crunch to the cauldron of goodness. Chicken mole - Amazing. Large portion definitely a shareable dish. Tortillas are mackin!  Fish tacos grilled - good, but not amazing. BBQ pork tacos - same as the cheese crisp but add an extra OMG... Seriously! I want to eat those pickled onions by the jar!  Noteworthy - We were visiting from out of town (SoCal) so this is by no means a testament to consistency. Also this was our first cheese crisp and are definitely NOT experts on all things cheese crisp.   4.5 stars because we were disappointed in the booze.   Thanks for the experience Blanco, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Chips and salsa are great. Mexican pizza is to die for! Nice atmosphere- but loud & busy. If you like that... check it out!"}
{"text":"I really liked Blanco, until my waitress informed me that their flour tortillas are cooked in animal lard. I have eaten at the Scottsdale location several times. I have thoroughly enjoyed the quesadillas and the cheese crisps. I was going to order the cheese crisp with guacamole tonight until the waitress said that she checked with the chef and the tortillas are not vegetarian.   I wish I would have been told this before I ate animal lard! Thank goodness for this location! Now I just wish I never would have tasted those delicious dishes!   We went for my birthday and the location honored my free dessert coupon from the Fox Restaurant Group but that's it - no cute candle or anything.   The manager did stop by to ask about our meal. I like when the managers stop by. He suggested the corn tortillas that are white like flour tortillas but homemade with lime juice. I'll give those a try next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing chips and salsa, queso, and ceviche! Downsides: Their salad dressings are bland. And most of their menu features meat by the truckloads, not much for other options."}
{"text":"So nice I had to eat outside! I started with the Crab & Shrimp Ceviche (Excellent big portion). Then I sampled  4 Tacos - Crispy Shrimp (Great), Carne Asada Good), BBQ beef (Good), Carnitas (Good) (With half flour & half corn). Just 2 Tacos and the Ceviche next time. Overall, a trip to tasty town."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos (didn't sample any tequila since it was too early in the day for the middle of the week for us) and decent service. I would give 5 stars but the price was a bit harsh for just a few tacos."}
{"text":"Great place that takes Mexican to whole new level. Awesome place !!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. A little different than your traditional Mexican, which was a nice change. Must try the different margaritas and the ceviche!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. Our Server was Amanda D. We got the tacos. They are about 3-4 bits but surprisingly filling and yummy. We also got the guacamole which was really good. We had no wait and our service was fantastic!!! We always had drinks and Amanda kept checking on us. Now that is service!! I'm happy we tried this place !!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Some of the freshest Mexican food I had on my week-long AZ vacation. Really enjoyed the garage-door open patio feel on the springy Easter Day. My family decided to try the famed cheese crisp. Ours was donned with guacamole, and crispy it was. A little bland for my taste, and I would recommend spending a few more bucks to get more toppings.   I ordered the shrimp tacos with corn tortillas as my main, adding in guac. That addition was essential; they should definitely make it part of the staple recipe. The shrimp and slaw combo was refreshing, and 3 corn tortilla tacos was perfectly filling. It's a rare day when I leave a Mexican restaurant feeling satisfied but not overstuffed. Blanco's portions fit the bill for the right size.   Our waitress was friendly and decently prompt. We will definitely be dining here again when back in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Not your typical Mexican restaurant  The carne asada was awesome, the chicken was awesome. I walked over from my hotel which was different but cool at the same time as I got to walk under a tunnel. The service exceeded my expectations as the server refilled my drinks when it was time without asking. it is a nice place to sit down and enjoy a good quality meal. The only reason I give them a 4 is because my rice and beans were ala cart. I had to pay extra but it is ok. You guys rock. I will be back and recommend others to give you a try."}
{"text":"Great food and drink. Street corn and tacos rock. Ask for Raymond as your server. Have fun"}
{"text":"Great service, delicious food and drinks! The jalape√±o mango margarita is amazing!! I have yet to find something on the menu that I did not enjoy. Definitely try the corn, YUM!"}
{"text":"Local go to spot. Good mix of food and drinks!"}
{"text":"We met up with some friends here on a recent weekend trip to Phoenix and had a really fun evening. I would say I am a fan more so because of the ambience and service. We snagged a patio table for our party of 7 and it was a perfect evening for dining al fresco. The whole restaurant itself has a nice vibe to it and is as trendy as you expect the Fox Restaurant group to be. Our server was really friendly and sooooo patient with us. He offered lots of suggestions when we couldn't decide on drinks or menu items. I tried their pork enchiladas and thought they were just OK. They were a bit spicy for my taste so I actually didn't finish my plate which is unusual...but it may have just been me not feeling the spicy that evening, who knows. My husband, however, learned from our server to order the fajitas IN a burrito and he loved it. He polished off his plate completely clean. Everyone else seemed satisfied with their food as no one was complaining. I would be willing to come back and try some other items from their menu. I think I should have looked at the menu a little more and picked something that I was really excited about. Next time!"}
{"text":"The waiter was very good. He stayed on top of all my soda refills. The food was excellent.  Lots of choices on the menu.  I highly recommend this restaurant for excellent Mexican food."}
{"text":"The tacos, quesadillas, and ceviche are great. The atmosphere is great and so is the service.   During the day, bring the grandkids, I do and they love it!"}
{"text":"This place was super packed, which in this case turned out to be for a good reason.  Service did a decent job anyway and were flexible in how they seated us outside, since we didn't want to wait - but it was plenty comfy and service was plenty attentive anyway.  The margaritas were great, and everything we ate was really good.  I'll definitely go back, but maybe on a week night...  Recommended."}
{"text":"Like most Fox concepts, Blanco is pretty good. I'm not rushing to come back any time soon (mainly because there is so much Mexican food in much closer proximity to my house), but I would be a repeat eater.   The food was pretty good - but not memorable. I really liked the chips and salsa and the guac. The veggie tacos were also very good. The chopped salad was good. The tuna tacos kind of meh. Good. And meh. So why the 4 stars?   Blow jobs! Well, almost. I think.  I was so impressed by the service. The hosts, waiters and managers were so attentive and friendly. Like, over-the-top friendly and giddy. Almost flirty. I'm sure if I was a dude they would have blown me or something. Next time I'm bringing a guy with me to test this theory. Anyone want to particpate in an experiment?"}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant...its not the best, but its a nice environment and the service is really nice and the food is pretty good...I would definitely go back because I enjoy it... I really like the blood orange margarita...I am one of those ppl that like a sweet drink...so it was perfect for me!! The mojito is great too!  If I were coming here just for the drinks I would give it 5 stars.  They are fabulous! The chips and salsa is great, but I love chips and salsa.   I have had the carnita tacos and they were decent...I enjoyed them but I have had better!   It is a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Blanco for our 3rd restaurant week meal. Been here before and it's great.  the hostess really was having a bad night and just needed to go home. Not one smile or even a hello. When we walked in just a blank stare. Great! (sarcasm)  Food and service were otherwise really good.   I had the green chile pork enchiladas and I love a good tomatillo sauce. The tres de leche cake was also wonderful!  It's kind of loud place and we got to hear the conversation about blow jobs from the table next to us."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant. It's one of my favorites. I've never had a bad experience and I love this location. Great decor and cool atmosphere. Awesome outdoor patio. They sometimes have a live D.J. playing music which is fun. I normally order the carne asada burrito. It's amazing, highly recommend! They have the best rice I've ever had! I could eat an entire bowl of it lol. Tacos are awesome. If you want something healthier, the Chopped salad is so good! Chips and salsa are good, sometimes too salty but still good. Only thing that's annoying is the tiny parking lot that they share with the restaurant next door. Almost never any parking spots although they do offer valet...but it's still inconvenient. Food is amazing!! Don't hesitate to try this place."}
{"text":"Blanco is by far my favorite restaurant. I go there on dates with my husband as well as have been there with my girlfriends. They have a small outdoor patio that maybe has 6 different tables (?) and is a great spot for when the weather is nice. The restaurant is open concept and a little noisy but not enough to bother me. I can still carry on a conversation with no problem. ALL the staff are nice, friendy, and knowledgeable. They did recently take off one of my favorite menu items - the ceviche. There is another one offered but it is not as good. The guacamole is amazing so that makes up for it :) All the tacos are outstanding and will definately fill you up. They have a great wine list that features my favorite Malbec - Altos del Plata. Their white sangria is great too! This spot is a must to visit!"}
{"text":"It is a \"popular\" restaurant in the heart of Scottsdale.  With that comes the usual scene of people that I normally try to avoid, but the food is pretty good.  They also have a pretty wide selection of bottled Mexican beers.  Its nice not have to settle for Corona.  Some people don't like the interior, but I like the clean, all-white look.  Its kind of a refreshing & calming look for a restaurant that wants you to relax.  Food is pretty filling & tasty.  Had the seared Ahi tacos, and they were filled with big tuna chunks.  Buddy had enchilads (he is from Tennessee), and he really liked them.  That in itself should be a win for a Mexican joint.  There's a lot of tequila here to try, but it can get pricey.  If the weather was nicer, I would have sat on the patio."}
{"text":"So simply one of my favorite meals ever. Outstanding food. Chicken burrito enchilada style. Guacamole was as good as I've had anywhere. The rice is so so good. This one is added. My wife loved it too. The service was perfect as well!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and I wasn't expecting much.  It looked like it was going to be a total \"white boy\" type Mexican restaurant.  And it sort of was, but the food had enough flavor that I enjoyed it. Prior to the meal, they brought out chips and salsa.  The salsa was pretty weak.  In about 2 minutes, my gf and I finished all of the salsa.  Our waiter walked by and noticed this and immediately asked if we wanted something a little bit spicier.  Of course we did.  He brought out a different type of salsa that was much better, much spicier. I ordered the fish tacos and there were very good.  Nothing much to say about that. Overall, I enjoyed the place.  Service was good.  Prices were fair.  When in the area again, I will go back."}
{"text":"Had a group presentation / meeting here today for lunch.  Did not know they have a room in the basement for groups.  Very comfortable, not freezing!!  Food was excellent, service was also.  Big fan of Blanco Taco!"}
{"text":"Margaritas amazing. White Peach is amazing. Place is clean. Mello music. Beautiful design & service is very friendly.  Open layout.i had no problems."}
{"text":"I have a hard time with this one because the food is good and waiters are fantastic, the hostesses however have been less that accommodating every time.  Most recently, came during happy hour on a Friday, got there early but after a 25 minute wait, we were brought to a table smaller than requested that wouldn't work- then waited another 20 minutes for another table, missing happy hour altogether :( Before that, came on a Sunday with a big group and reservation - but was seated at a round booth not big enough for us all and bumping arms and one person standing on the edge. I mean, it's pretty loud so maybe they can't hear the number of people you requested?  Again, the food and drinks are good though and I love FRC restaurants so I keep coming back hoping to give a better review."}
{"text":"Great Great Great Great food Great service Great atmosphere  What can I say I love the place And it's walking distance from Embassy Suites"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time for lunch on 02/28/2014. Customer service was great all around. Our waitress was on top of everything- she never let our drinks or chips get low and checked on us every few minutes. Super quick service. A manager came around once and asked how everything was. Every person I even walked past was friendly and courteous and had a smile on their face. And of course, the food was delicous. No complaints."}
{"text":"Here 2 weeks ago. Great service with Alex as our waiter! Me and my husband are big on a great attitude from the person serving our food and he was awesome. Mine and my husbands drinks were refilled promptly and the food was very good. Great atmosphere, great staff, and great food and drinks! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"my wife and I hose blanco for lunch and upon arriving I was placed on a wait list for a table. I was told, by the hostess, that i would be recieving a text alert for my table. Waited for about 20 minutes and saw 3 tables being seated after walking right in with no wait. I went to speak with the hostess and she was rather rude to me and said that she sent the message and nothing can be done. Not tolerable for the class of eatery"}
{"text":"Honestly- this Blanco location is my go-to restaurant. I have never had a bad meal- service is always great- fun atmosphere- great location. Whenever we have friends from out of town, we take them here. I always get the three tacos with street corn and rice. AMAZING. By far one of my favorite restaurants in town. Thank you, Blanco!"}
{"text":"Good food but plan to spend your time waiting. We waited 40 mins to be seated. Waited 1 hour for our food. Service left more to be desired. Probably wouldn't go again. However might be a great option for take out."}
{"text":"I want to give a special shot out to Brad! I started with the house margarita and I absolutely hated it. I'm not a guy that sends anything back but he could see the bitter in my face and immediately rushed over to salvage my taste buds. He recommended the rosalees downfall; amazing.  New Year's Eve dinner was terrific! Thanks again Brad!"}
{"text":"Why 5 stars? Because this was easily my favorite meal in Arizona.     ---   ---   ---  I grew up in Houston but have virtually no pride for the area. One of the only things that causes me to include the word \"virtually\" in there is my love for Tex-Mex. My lovely family who still live there are pretty cool too, but it's mainly about the Mexican food.  When I've eaten Mexican food out west, it generally just doesn't have the same vibe to it. Growing up in Texas, I just assumed that Mexican food was like that everywhere, but I've come to love and appreciate the specific art of Tex Mex.   So when I recently visited the Phoenix area, I was curious to dive in and try as much Mexican as possible. My first experience at another restaurant was similar to what I've found in California: tasty, but it didn't quite line up with what I was hoping for. But then I experienced Blanco Tacos.  Is it possible to be different than Tex Mex, but also absolutely hit the spot?   First off, the queso wasn't much different from what you find in Houston -¬†it was amazing. Melted cheese in the form of a dip is almost always at least going to be 4-stars by default, but this was straight up bury-me-in-this-cheese 5-stars.  And then the steak fajitas came. They looked different, smelled different and tasted different than what I've ever seen before, but I absolutely loved them. I really wish I could pinpoint exactly what they added to the meat to get them to taste the way that they did, but it's so hard to pinpoint. Maybe it was just some alternate form of an A-1 steak sauce? I don't really love A-1, so I know it wasn't that, but it was something like it.   I'm not sure I'll ever figure it out, but I do know this -¬†my next trip to the Valley will consist of a visit to Blanco Tacos. That much, I am certain of."}
{"text":"Such a cute atmosphere and amazing shrimp tacos. I really like the look and feel of this place. When the weather is nice, the patio is a great place to meet friends. I have had a few things here, but the shrimp tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"Looking at the star rating for this place I was shocked. I love Blanco! It's one of my favorite Fox Restaurant Concepts. They have fabulous house margaritas and tons of beers to choose from. I recommend the carne asada tacos, they are consistently good. The rice there is awesome. Blanco is always a go to place for good food and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and had an amazing experience! I ordered the Green Chili Pork Enchiladas and they were delicious. The way they prepare Enchiladas is fairly unique and not a way that I've had them before. The Enchiladas are prepared in a skillet and made almost lasagna style (layers) rather than being rolled up. They were very delicious and I would definitely order them again. The place has a cool vibe and is pretty casual I'd say. It is suitable for kids as we had our daughter with us and it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I love this place. Do note, The key is knowing what to order. The chicken fajitas are shockingly good. The chicken is consistently juicy and packed with flavor. I'm also a huge fan of their guacamole and salsa selection.   P.S. Don't order the salmon, it's terribly blas√©."}
{"text":"Better than the location in Scottsdale. I gave them 4 stars because of hit or miss service. I've been to this location twice and have had a flawless experience both times. Fox Concept Plaza (which is what I'm calling that area) offers a lot of tough choices for dinner. The service at these locations versus Scottsdale is night and day better."}
{"text":"Blanco down by the Biltmore area is better. Service is better, outdoor seating is better. The food and cocktails are great at both places. This is definitely my favorite Fox Concept restaurant, with Zinburger being a close second. I love the tacos and blood orange margarita. We've had issues with this one bringing us shitty chips with some excuse as to why they don't have the good home made ones and then 10 minutes later the next basket we get comes with the good chips :| or great service until we need the check and then it is like pulling teeth. Stupid things to complain about... which is why they still get 4 stars. I'm giving the other Blanco 5 stars, you aren't as polished. Deal with it."}
{"text":"Great location, Excellent Service and Wonderful tacos.  I sat at the bar, the bartender was friendly and helpful. Was around 2pm and the place had a nice buzz to it. The chips and salsa are great. I had the tacos. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Margaritas and food were awesome. We had a party of 10 and couldn't get a table, so we sat outside huddled around a fire pit table. It worked okay, it was just annoying to see quite a few tables open in the restaurant and a constant long wait. It's like they were trying to create demand. Service was weird; food and drinks came out in shifts, sometimes quite long periods of time in between. We would go back though - we had fun and enjoyed the food/drinks."}
{"text":"Great tasting Margaritas. I recommend the mango jalape√±o margarita. I had. Green pork enchilada and my husband had a burrito. We both felt the portions were good sized and the flavor was good. I would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and good food,  two combination for a place to eat.  Service was great and the tacos I got were delicious.  Got habenero salsa with my chips which was nice.  The tortilla with my tacos were nicely toasted and the rice has a good flavor to it."}
{"text":"Fox concept restaurants are always if nothing else classy and the outdoor environment at the Biltmore is fabulous. The aesthetic of the restaurant and the our waiter was fantastic. Great service, friendly and accommodating. The Margaritas were on point. My son, husband and I all tried the tacos and got the nachos as a appetizer. I would say they were ok. Good but not amazing. The main reason for my 3 star review is the price. I felt like it was just too high. Sunday lunch ran us over $100. I wouldn't say I was disappointed but I could definitely find better for cheaper in the central Phoenix area.  Parking is easy here and they validate for the first hour."}
{"text":"We love Blancos! Atmosphere and food are always excellent. I always get the crispy shrimp tacos which are the best I've ever had. My husband enjoys the pork tacos. Although our waiter today was very slow, we normally have great service. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Service this go around was great, I got steak with my fajitas and he guac was deadly delicious.   Overall, a good stop"}
{"text":"Well, had company in from out of town. We were thinking of where to go eat but were surprised when they asked to try this place. At first i thought it was going be some small place but when we saw that it was at the Biltmore we thought it had to be good. Well the prices of drinks were as expected. When the food came out we were ready to eat. Totally let down!! The chips and salsa (chips) were somewhat stale. Then when the food came out we were not happy. Ive eaten better and not pay some ridiculous price. Wont be going back!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great drinks, tacos, nachos, Guacamole is amazing. Have Lupita serve you at the bar and you will never go wrong. Check this place out happy hour or whenever"}
{"text":"the food was awful and expensive for what you got the service was great and I liked the fact you can sit outside"}
{"text":"This place is awful!!! Go to Mission and get actual, edible food. This place is a joke. Literally only people from small towns with no sense for actual flavor think this place is good.  Margaritas- gross.. not fresh. Got a spicy.. tasted like they flavored the Marg with jalepino flavor rather than fresh jalepino   Enchiladas- horrible. The sauce tastes like mayo.. Mexicans don't use mayo in their enchilada sauce. Plus there's a glob or sour cream on top... makes no sense. I literally couldn't eat it, it was like eating spoonfuls of mayo..  Shrimp and steak fajitas.. if u like Applebee's... there's we're ok.. at least they didn't taste like mayo...  Queso with beef. Literally the only thing out of drink, enchiladas and fajitas that we were able to eat and semi enjoy.  Do not go here. The big sign should be warning enough. There is way too much good Mexican food in Arizona to waste your money and time at this place. The enchilada sauce was a DISGRACE!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was horrible. They told me they didn't take reservations and to call ahead (on a Tuesday) so I did. They told me it was a 45 minute wait and said they text me.  Without asking for my number.  I went back a minute later when I realized they never got it. Then after an hour and 15 minutes of waiting, they told me they texted me and I didn't respond. The food was horrible, the Mexican corn with the worst I've ever had and everything was overpriced.  I will not go back !!!"}
{"text":"This new Sam Fox restaurant opens on November 24 (OK, so they DO have one in Tucson, but it's new to us). We had the privilege of going to a Pre-Opening dinner to benefit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Essentially, all of the money we paid to attend went to CFF and Blanco essentially gave us an open tab at their restaurant. It was a complete dry run, so the entire menu was in play!   First off, very friendly staff. We had to wait about 20 minutes for our table, but the bar was lively and, while crowded, it was still easy to stand around and enjoy your drink, with the house DJ also keeping the mood buzzing. If we had wanted to \"hover\" for a couch, their patio is filled with big blue couches and fire-pits, facing Scottsdale road. Their full menu is served on the patio (as well as the bar), but we decided that we'd wait for a booth inside.   Once seated, or server made sure we were all set on drinks and walked us through the menu. We started by sharing a Roasted Chicken and Poblano Chile Crisp, which is essentially a little Mexican pizza. For a main course, I enjoyed the Fish Tacos, while the Seared Ahi Tacos and the Beef Enchiladas also graced our table. Not exactly earth shattering dining concepts, but there wasn't a bite of food left when it was all over.   For desert, our server recommended that we try THREE different desserts, so we went with the Tres Leche (kind of an oat-ish interpretation, but good!), the Caramel Flan (excellent! and probably the largest hunk of flan I'd ever seen!) and finally, the Rich Chocolate Cake (very dense and a bit too chocolaty, even for me).   All in all, a good meal, but what rockets this rating to 4-stars instead of a possible 3 were the margaritas. All the juices are fresh and they aren't too tart OR too sweet. And, while you didn't necessarily realize it by taste, there was enough tequila in them to put down a small horse. By my second margarita, there was no way I was driving home. We'll be back to Blanco soon, but next time we're hiring a driver!"}
{"text":"The service is always very reliable when visiting the Sam Fox concepts. The food is consistent too and although taste and liking can vary it's a descent spot for lunch.  Today I tried the guacamole, the enchiladas with red chile and the borracho beans and rice.   The ancho chili in the enchiladas was definitely not my favorite.  Yes ancho is a very strong pepper but balance is everything with Mexican foods and this one definitely missed the mark.  Then top it with a sour cream and well meh.. Proceed with caution.   The rice is cooked in milk it seems and I'm not a big fan of it. I really would expect a red rice rather than this stove top rice with cilantro, this doesn't make it Mexican.    The borracho beans are the usual pork and beans mix.  I don't mind them actually but the black beans are better.   Lastly the guacamole was okay, not 9 bucks okay as it's mixed in with sour cream and sprinkled with some cotija cheese.   Overall I will keep this place in my lunch options list.  Although the food is not at the caliber I find at a Zin Burger or True Food I can definitely always appreciate good service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Matt is the absolute man. Not only is he a world class server he is extremely nice guy. We walked in 2 minutes before happy hour ended and he let us get happy hour (kudos). Also, the food here is great. If you get the chance try the street corn. Bomb. Anywho, try this place out and if you can, get Matt as a server."}
{"text":"Margaritas were great, tried several options.  Food was mediocre, though we did come for happy hour.  The service was just okay...frequently had to find the waiter to make another drink Order.  Worth it if you have the patience and want a good marg."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was excellent.  The prices were reasonable considering we were in Scottsdale. The atmosphere was upscale and very clubby. The patio was a great place to sit and people watch.  I would definitely recommend this place to people of all ages."}
{"text":"Favorite taco spot in town, and Blanco has the best margs I've ever had even if they're a little pricey outside of happy hour. Every single time my girlfriend and I have come here, the service has been phenomenal. We prefer the Biltmore location to Scottsdale for the overall vibe, but both locations are great.  The BBQ pork tacos are always a go to, the rice is on point, the salsa/queso options are delicious, and their carne asada burrito is spectacular. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Got a gift card to this place for christmas and we totally loved it! Anytime we get the opportunity to go to Scottsdale this is our first choice. Carne Asada tacos are delicious and the salsa is delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great Margaritas and yummy food, can't think of a better combination.  I usually order the three tacos (which is more than enough food for me, I usually end up bringing one of the tacos home).  My favorites are the CRISPY SHRIMP with Pickled Onion, Fresno Chile, Guacamole and the SLOW COOKED BAR-B-Q PORK with Roasted Corn & Tomato Slaw, Pickled Onions, Crema Fresca.  I'm also a huge fan of the Blanco rice that's included with the tacos.  It's light, tasty and nothing like the horrible rice that many Mexican restaurants serve.  In addition to the traditional house Margarita I've also had the MIXED BERRY, WHITE PEACH & HIBISCUS, BLOOD ORANGE, and TROPICAL PINEAPPLE, all were delicious.  Our servers have always been helpful and friendly and have added to a wonderful experience each time we've visited."}
{"text":"The chips, salsa, and teas are good.   I havent had any alcoholic drinks there so I cant vouch. Ive been meaning to review this place for a while. Because everytime I go, I remember how unimpressive the food is, and I tell myself I wont return. And then I forget and return, and remember all over again. All the food kinda sorta tastes the same. I dont know how else to explain it. Once I got steak tacos (before I went veg) and they were chewy (in the bad way). Yekh. This time around, I got portobello tacos. Not seasoned well at all. Ive had tastier tofu.   And they apparently only season their rice one way. And that is not a good way.   I would return for chips, salsa, and to try their drinks, but I would skip the food. Nothing great about it."}
{"text":"Brought my family here after a horrible experience at Lon's at Hermosa. Happy to say our server ( wish I remembered his name) turned a crappy night into an amazing one with his exceptional personality & attention to detail! The food was amazing, and so was the service!!  Cant wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"I took the advice of many others who had commented on Yelp. I had the tacos with carne asada, crispy shrimp, and bbq pork. It was delicious! The chips and salsa were some of the best I've ever had! We had a great server too!"}
{"text":"Blanco is one Sam Foxy modern Mexican restaurant. I just love the interior's bluish, brownish, orange-y color scheme and the comfy outdoor patio containing mood enhancing fire pits. Hey Sam, can I borrow your Foxy interior design team to come dress-up my home? They seriously know their stuff.  Beyond my admiration of Blanco's interior and exterior design, I think this is one concept that Sam got right. By no means is this restaurant even remotely authentic, but it's not supposed to be. Good old uncle Sam doesn't do authentic. Sam does Americanized and trendy best. Even the name Blanco fits the whitewashed, or should I say Blancowashed, menu.    Sam tossed Chipotle's bland food, a taco truck, a wood-fire grill, Latin cocktails, trendy decor, and a Scottsdale scene into a blender, and Voila! He whipped up the perfect Blancoshake that brings all the boys and girls to Blanco's yard - setting the stage for some seriously entertaining, and enjoyably funny, people watching.  How's the service? Fantastic! I'm always well taken care of from the drink refills to the mid-meal table check-ins. The friendly wait staff and welcoming hostesses are all on top of their game, and even attractively well dressed. Big surprise, right? I know a couple guys who outright admit that they love Blanco for those polo dresses that the hostesses wear (an FYI for the dudes out there).   What's my favorite Blanco dish? That would be the Shrimp Fajitas. Cooked on wood-fire grill and combined with caramelized onions and peppers, the plump shrimp have this smoky, charred and blackened taste. The accompanying rice, beans and tortillas aren't anything to write home about though. All 3 taste like Chipotle's bland food. Matt always makes fun of me because I order the Shrimp Fajitas but I just eat the shrimp fajita mix with my fork. I don't even make a real fajita. It's just not worth the extra effort. Those shrimpies are too delish to be combined with just blandness.   What else to I recommend on the menu? You must try the tacos! All the meat & seafood is cooked to perfection on that wood-fire grill I love oh so much. In fact, without that grill, I don't think the menu would be as tasty.   I also must say that their Margaritas are fruity, and their Mojitos are yummy to sip on. All the cocktails are pretty much standard Sam Fox concoctions.   And what about the nachos? Oh yeah, those are scrumptious too! Actually, all of the appetizers have got it goin on. Cheese Crips - salty, melty, cheesy and crunchy. Ceviche - fresh, spicy, tangy, limey and juicy. Guacamole - perfectly seasoned, chunky and fresh avocados coupled with rock salt crystals and flavorful cotija cheese.   In fact, that guacamole is so intensely good it feels like a ripe green avocado punches my taste buds with every bite. Blanco's avocados are packing serious flavor.   What menu item should you skip? Pass on the Salmon a la Parrilla. It's just weird and at $18 bucks it did anything but impress. The salmon wasn't fresh or flaky enough, and the accompanying spinach, squash and corn mixed with chile verde was bland with a strange aftertaste. Trust me, you are wayyyyy better off with a plate of tacos or fajitas, and you'll get a boatload more food for the same price or less.  Overall, Blanco's atmosphere fits any occasion and any sized group. So... give Blanco a go!"}
{"text":"Blanco is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants; my girlfriend and I go nearly every other week for drinks and some food after work. The food here is great! An awesome high-end Mexican taco spot! The elote is delicious as well as the drinks! If you are looking for a fun hip taco spot and don't mind paying a little more this is the spot to go, typically 5 stars from me! I love all the Fox restaurants but this day might have changed my opinion of Blanco. On October 17,2017 we went to Blanco and the whole restaurant had changed it's design. The menu had been updated and when we ordered our typical favorites, they tasted noticeably different and were not up to our expectations. Also on this particular visit, the food had cooled down by the time it reached our table, which made it even less enjoyable.  Every time we go to Blanco I usually order the carne asada burrito. My girlfriend usually orders three street tacos, carnitas, bbq pork and chipotle shrimp. Her favorite was the chipotle shrimp. She substituted the typical rice for street corn and thought it was good too. I got the black beans and rice to go along with my burrito. Generally, we love the food. However, we've recently noticed some inconsistencies. As I previously stated, the menu was recently updated at the Scottsdale location and the food seemed inferior to the norm. Also, we stopped by while we were on a trip to Tucson and each received substantially undercooked carne asada, which left us dissatisfied and without appetites. Although the service is usually friendly and accommodating, as with most Fox Concept Restaurants I've tried, this time around they were not as willing to help. When we pointed out the undercooked carne asada, the server brushed it off and did not offer for our meals to be recooked.  The atmosphere is one of my favorite aspects of the restaurant. I love to go during the NBA playoffs because the crowd around the restaurant is really excited and you can feel the energy in the room.  The food is great; everyone is having a great time and the service is prompt and friendly, what more can you asked for. Each location of Blanco's is uniquely decorated, but all have a laid back beach vibe. All locations have indoor and outdoor seating that is accompanied by lively, colorful d√©cor. Of the locations I've been to, the restaurant seems to typically be focused around the bar and the kitchen is within view of customers which also contributes to the laid back atmosphere of the restaurant.   The food at Blanco is priced fairly with most entrees ranging between 12 - 20 dollars. The drinks are slightly more expensive with most cocktails being about $10 each. I like to go during happy hour when there are some food and drink specials. The sangria is a must, and on happy hour a carafe which can get you about 4 glasses is only $18 which ends up being only $4.50 per glass. Overall, I would recommend Blanco! Although we have had a couple less than ideal visits, the restaurant usually has great food, good prices, and friendly service."}
{"text":"Blanco has become our new go-to spot for girls nights! The happy hour menu is wonderful, with large portions and appropriate prices.  Order the Red Berry margarita, chips/guac and shrimp fajitas: you will not be disappointed!   :)"}
{"text":"Blanco is a nice restaurant with great food and usually great service. Their fajitas are amazing, their margaritas are always tasty and well poured, and the service is usually speedy and friendly.   One of my biggest pet peeves is walking up to the hostess and not being greeted. Tonight upon entering Blanco the two young girls hostessing merely stared at me when I approached, one was chomping on gum. When I realized they would not say so much as a hello, I said \"two please\" and was quickly ushered to a table. The gum chewing girl took away the silverware closest to her, disregarding the fact she set the menu on the place setting on which she took the silverware.   We had such a nice and attentive server. The food was tasty, as always. The apple pie Margarita was delicious and tasted just like apple pie!  When my friend and I got up to leave, the young lady who was chomping on the gum at the beginning of the night muttered a \"have a nice night\" without so much as a glance in our direction.   Perhaps I'm far too picky for a \"casual\" dining establishment, but when your servers are very friendly and the food is great but pricey ($75+ for a dinner for two), why have the first people guests encounter be undertrained and lacking in manners?"}
{"text":"This place has the best nachos!  They actually put the cheese and toppings in the middle of the pile so you are always getting something on each chip.  They have great food and great drinks. The only issue I have had here is service.  The last two times, we were seated and then no one came to the table.  I actually had to flag down someone and ask who our server was as we had been seated for 15 minutes and people around us were being served but not us.  We finally got our server and she was amazing, but at least acknowledge us and give us some waters."}
{"text":"First time visiting this location.  I've visited other FRC locations many times before and I must said that this location is pretty unique.  This restaurant sits on a very busy intersections right off 24th St. & Camelback Rd. in the Biltmore Fashion Park.  I went there on a busy Saturday afternoon for lunch, the restaurant wasn't very full but it was pretty busy.  I ordered Blanco Burger, you can't go wrong with a burger in a Mexican restaurant.  The meat was very tender and moisture, the best part of the burger was the sauce they put in on top of the beef, it has Guacamole, Pico de Gallo & Chipotle Mayo.  It was a little bit hot for my taste but I do enjoy it very much.  The fries were very crispy and fresh as well.  They have a very limited parking spaces here so I had to park somewhere close to the back near the hotel.  Their restaurant has a private dining hall on the basement by the restrooms, it's good if you have a private party and don't want to be bothered by other people.  Overall services were excellent and the food was just great.  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Good food, bad margaita, so-so patio It was my birthday and I wanted to start the day out with friends having a relaxing lunch with plenty of drinks before shopping at Scottsdale Fashion square. We're big fans of Blanco Taco at the Biltmore so we cane to the Scottsdale Road version and we're a bit disappointed. The food was just as good, but atmosphere and service were not. Food-wise, you can't go wrong at Blanco. This trip was chips and salsa - fresh baked and plenty salty with a mild salsa you can't beat. I moved onto the Crab and Shrimp ceviche and was delighted by the creamy avocado and freshness of the tomato and citrus dressing. Classic Margarita was a sour mess - why bother. Atmosphere - the patio seating has large lounge chairs - too large in fact. They're the kind built for 6-foot tall mutants, so if you're 5-2 like me, you can't lean back and relax without folding your feet up or leaning back like a pre-teen girl without a sense of posture. The umbrella coverage is so-so which would've been fine if they'd invested in fans or misters.  The patio is also out in the parking lot and not well shielded. Put up some plants and screens people! Service - our waiter was below average and seemed annoyed to be there. His shift was ending, but our celebration wasn't which didn't matter to him. Total buzz kill.  With plenty of choices in and near Old Town, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Blancos. My experience was just fine from a customer service and atmospheric standpoint, but I wasn't particularly in love with the food. I had the Caesar salad (definitely not bad, but in no way evoked the spirit of its namesake) and carne/chicken fajitas. The meat was actually pretty good (its marinated, and I wasn't disappointed in the flavor profiles at all). The side of guacamole/sour cream/pico was a little stingy. Overall, not a bad experience; I might come back for a drink sometime."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend the habenero salsa and trying out some of the different flavored margaritas, they have one with jalapeno in it that is very good."}
{"text":"Great for gluten free eaters!! They don't have a gluten free menu, but are very knowledgable and accommodating. There are many menu options and they understand cross contamination! If you call ahead they will make sure you have gluten free chips for you too. Great food and good service! I have celiac disease and felt very safe eating there."}
{"text":"We loved the crispy shrimp tacos. The food is very fresh here. Highly recommend eating here"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with a couple great friends this past Friday night. We read about Blanco in the 'Where, Scottsdale' magazine and in another random Scottsdale mag they have at the massive information booth at the spendy Fashion Square Mall (you can really get a shopping fix on there, but that's another review - with more stars too!). Shame on me, I should have used the Yelp app on my iPhone to read the reviews before we decided on that place because it was a pretty decent sized let down... I just mistakenly figured that any place that boasts 50 tequilas would have decent Mexican food.   I have it in me but I'm not going to get all Mexican food preachy on you all but let's be real. This place is more Mexican inspired than traditional fare.   Top line:  1) Red wine sangria was marginal at best  2) Guacamole bland (they don't ask for preference on spice and it isn't made table side) - chips were THICK! Salsa was Pace like - seemed like it was from a jar, not freshly made. 3) Ahi tacos were inedible with an ancho chile and pepper flavor that was overbearing to the point of a burnt taste - we actually didn't even eat three pieces of the tuna (each taco has maybe eight sushi sized slices of tuna on it). They were also a little rubber like, not the melt in your mouth grade tuna.  4) The signature dish of beef rib enchiladas was probably the biggest let down - like the guacamole, just plain and bland in flavor.  5) Not sure about the rice concoction, it was very creamy and buttery, almost Rice-A-Roni like. 6) Caramel flan was American style with a huge among of whip cream on top. Flan is one of my weaknesses and I only had two small bites... bla bla bla!!! Downright SAD!   Lastly, it was a noisy place with little ambiance.   The best thing about this place was the side of pintos (charro style) that came with the entrees and the chorizo & cheese crisp. Those alone wouldn't warrant a return trip. Sorry Blanco, our first encounter just didn't lead me to want to see you again... No hard feelings, really - staff was pleasant, valet was efficient, food was just not great amigo!"}
{"text":"I've only tried a few of their tacos and here goes the breakdown... CARNITAS: Definitely my favorite of the three.  Good flavor and texture CARNE ASADA:  Least favorite.  The meat was chopped up into tasteless bits. FISH:  Average... nothing more to say  I did really like the rice that came with the tacos.    Margarita hit the spot.  I will probably try it again because it's close and convenient to where I work.  I would not go out of my way to try it again."}
{"text":"Had time for a bite while waiting for an appointment at the apple store so the girlie and I came in here. We both got the house specialty, short rib enchilada. I had the berry mojito and she had some other vodka drink.   The food was amazing! I especially liked the rice, which had a light lime/cilantro flavor. The beans weren't my favorite. The enchilada was really good. It wasn't your standard enchilada you get anyplace, had a little different flavor in the sauce, but I like that. I like variety and appreciate different places making things their own.   Our server was very nice and good. We were in a slight hurry due to our appointment but we told her when we ordered and asked if she could bring boxes and the check along with the food. She might not have liked that, but if she had a problem with it, we certainly couldn't tell.   The only prob were the prices, $50 for lunch for two is a little high, but in hindsight, one meal would have easily fed us both. Next time I want to get the ceviche. Looked fantastic!"}
{"text":"The avocado pork cheese crisp is a must get for an appetizer. The BBQ pork taco is one of the best tacos I have ever had. Cool modern vibe to the restaurant and great service."}
{"text":"The food here is great and service is excellent. Do not come here if you want traditional/authentic Mexican food. Its super americanized, but that is not necessarily a bad thing."}
{"text":"Marginal food, small portions, over-priced.  Service was awful.  Pass"}
{"text":"I left my review in the comments section...so here goes again. The food is amazing! You can get the 3 taco plate and chose 3 different flavors. The beef rib one was the absolute best! The flan was amazing with just the right sweetness and the service was wonderful! We had a party of 15."}
{"text":"If a Mexican joint filled with 99% Gabachos was a sign for great Mexican food then Blancos Tacos would be 5 stars.  hahahahaha  No seriously, if you want great ethnic food don't go to the place patronized by the \"White People\" doesn't matter what foreign ethnicity.     Look it is obvious by my name I am Mexican.  I have eaten the great Mexican food from thousands of sources.  From the peasant farm worker's home made nuggets of gold to the top Taquerias in Mexico and So Cal I have eaten it all.   I also can cook anything from the Mexican Culture.  So folks I know my shit.  So I was curious if Blanco Tacos and their 14 dollar overpriced burritos would actually hang with the culinary giants that I have tasted in my life.   Sorry folks, but not even close.  I should have known better considering they sport a variety of pretentious tequilas that no Mexican I know would even drink.  If they wanted to really be hip and in the know, they would have skipped all the bullshit they serve and just go straight to hand crafted small batch Mescal.   But I don't even think Blanco Tacos understands that.  So keep serving your Patron, which was started by a White Dude from the Hair Salon market.  LMFAO  So Carlos cut the BS, what about the food.    Well it was piss poor.   First lets talk basic Pico De Gallo salsa.   I never heard in my life that LIME ZEST is in that salsa.  But it sure tasted like it and kinda ruined it.    They over-season their Carne Asada meat with tons of salt, but under-salt their actual salsas, very weird.   Is the chef actually taste testing this shit?   So the Carne Asada tastes way way way overspiced to boot, but their braised fancy spancy short ribs are under-seasoned and flavorless.  WTF.  Once again, how the fuck do you do this?  Burritos were small with barely any meat.  Wet means brushed with a coating and not actually wet from sauce.  Rice was flavorless and mushy. Man I could go on and on.  I will just sum up the food with one word.  FAIL.    It seemed like the chef was influenced by one place and one place only.  Chipotle.  Another Gabacho treasure to the American people.  So if you blind tasted tested this food against any of the other MILLION Mexican joints in Phoenix that sell food for 1/3 the price, what would be the result?  Come on you really need me to answer this?      One thing I know for sure.  Go and read any of the reviews that raved about this place.  You can be assured those people know JACK SHIT about \"REAL\" Mexican food.  ADIOS"}
{"text":"My review is not about the food, atmosphere, price, etc - it is about the service, and specifically the service and comment from one particular server/bartender.  I have stopped in here a few times for a margarita/chips etc.  Nothing memorable - hey, it's Mexican Food...it's all pretty good and pretty much the same.  What happened a few weeks ago is the reason for my review.  I'm sitting at the bar one afternoon as the bartender (don't know her name - blonde, I'd say in her late 20's early 30's) is giving me very average service.  No big deal, I'm not really paying much attention.  At the same time she is chatting it up with someone else - another server or customer, I don't really know.  Then, when chatting it up, she says something to the effect - \"yea, I thought that was so 'retarded'\".   As if to say something was really whacky or messed up...I guess...but for some reason she used the word 'retarded' to communicate whatever she was trying to say.  Now...I know some of you reading this review may think I'm being some kind of word police, but 'retarded' is simply not a word to use in any way, and particularly the way she was using it, and especially particularly not when you are serving strangers in a very public setting.    She probably just doesn't understand the hurt this word causes to people who are friends or family of people who were born with a mental disability.  If so, she might better understand that when the word 'retarded' is used to describe something or someone as stupid, messed up, insane, whacky...whatever, none of these things relate to someone who has been born with a mental disability.  They are not stupid, they were born with a disability.  They are not messed up, they were born with a disability.  They are not whacky, they were born with a disability.  They are not insane, they were born with a disability.    'Retarded' is simply not a word to ever be used, by anyone.  Period."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were seated right away on a Friday night around 6:30pm. We opted to sit outside on the patio. One section was reserved for a large party so I was surprised that we were able to get a table so quick. Inside was pretty packed and there was some live music going on near the entrance.  Our server was very attentive and gave a lot of great suggestions. We ordered a carafe of sangria (red) which was $18. Excellent deal. We probably got about 4 glasses out of it as the ice melted, but it never tasted watered down. Fruity but not too sweet.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas and she ordered the pork burrito. We both had black beans and rice. The enchiladas come flat, in a cast iron skillet. My dish was perfect - saucy, just enough spice, consistent cheese all of the way through. The rice was a little more wet than I prefer but my dinner date enjoyed it. She ordered her burrito enchilada style with green sauce. The only downside was that the pork was a little too salty but she enjoyed it anyway.  Drinks, two entrees, complimentary chips and salsa (awesome salsa, btw) - $45. There is a window near the courtyard for tacos and possibly some other easy options which I want to check out. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Met some friends here on a Friday night and waited over 2 hours to get a table. I have never EVER waited that long to get a table, anywhere but I am soooo glad we did.  The service was impeccable and the food was to die for.  So good and different than anything I have had in a long time.  The prices were great too, which just made this an amazing experience all around.  Totally would get 5 stars if I didn't have to wait 2 hours."}
{"text":"Sam Fox (Fox Restaurant Concepts) is always looking for the next big trend to scale and right now it appears that tacos are the thing.   The atmosphere is modern and very stylish. With a big bar in the center of the room and plenty of flat screen TVs I can see how this would be a fun place at night or to watch a game. Service was very good.  However, the food could use some improvement. The tacos aren't nearly as tasty as those at Barrio Queen, Diego Pops, or Cien Agaves.   Still, Blanco might do better than all of those as FRC has the ability to place restaurants at shopping malls all over the country and most places don't have the type of competition for Mexican food that there is in Scottsdale.  Overall, Blanco was good, but not great."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's alright...americanized mexican food that's pretty tasty.  Personally my favorite thing on the menu is the appetizer nachos with beef.  They serve it smothered in a lot of cheese and beef...it's served with this creamy/spicy/cheesy sauce that I have no idea what it is, but it's damn good.  Also, the chips on the nachos and the chips from the chips and salsa they serve when you're seated  are always crisp and stay crisp throughout the meal...pretty good.  I had the fish tacos the first time I was here and had the shrimp tacos the last time.  The fish was okay and the shrimp really didn't have much flavor.  They use a lot of sauces with the tacos...kinda like spicy sour creams.  The sauces taste good, but they drown out the other tastes in the dish.  If it weren't for the nachos I would probably give this place two stars."}
{"text":"Love love! The food is always fabulous and the service is great. Love it, it's always very busy but we always have stellar service and the street corn is amazing! Both locations around me are equally great so get its a win win"}
{"text":"Great place for Lunch or dinner.  Had lunch there and highly recommend the Mexican Chopped Zealand with Chicken. Excellent.    Good, efficient, friendly service.  We were helped very capably and expertly by Sean, who made us an excellent cup of coffee to boot.     I would highly recommend this place and would come back here again."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the Blanco's in north Tucson. The food is fabulous, the views are incredible and the service is impeccable. The Scottsdale location is not so great. My husband and I went here for an early dinner one night and we waited for a table for what felt like an eternity (even though there were only like 6 other diners) and our waitress frequently forgot about us. Then to top it off, I got sick after eating my tacos! My husband enjoyed his meal and his margarita but we won't return."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times over the past couple years.  My family and I will drive up from Gilbert just to eat here because it's so good! We like how they are very gluten-free friendly as my mom has an allergy.  Best food is the tacos with pretty much any meat! Mixed berry margaritas are great too! I'd suggest going during happy hour and save $$$!"}
{"text":"Ok, not Arizona Mexican restaurant ok, just Midwestern tourist Mexican ok.    Had a skinny margarita.  It was watery with no tequila flavor,  which is odd in Arizona. With so many great places to get a margarita the competition is high. I guess I'm spoiled.   Also tried the Corn appetizer (alote) and Questo dip. Both lacked depth of flavor and fell flat. The alote needed a bit more lime and some heat. We ended up mixing the corn and queso together which made it ok.  The salsa was tomato heavy with no flavor of chilis or cilantro. Again, sorry Fox, we're probably Arizona jaded and pretty Mexican food picky.   Our winter visitors from Wisconsin will love this place as it's not too \"hot\" and spicy.  For us, it was bland.  On a side note - the patio was a shock.  We anticipated more having tried other Fox restaurants.  The patio was filthy with tired old dirty cushions and uncomfortable furniture.  And the wait staff seemed almost angry or apathetic to customers.  We were celebrating a beautiful afternoon and never said a word other than smile and place orders but felt unwelcome.  Apparently others did too as we watched people quickly come and go.  We came for lunch but had an appetizer & drink then left for lunch somewhere else."}
{"text":"Blanco's is still as delicious as when I first tried it about 10 years ago at the Scottsdale location. We ordered the nachos queso Blanco and it was absolutely amazing. We also ordered the bbq pork cheese crisp, which was equally as delectable as the nachos. It's hard to pick which was more superior and I don't think I have the heart to choose. There was no wait to be seated, the server was very attentive, and the atmosphere was busy but clean and efficient. 10/10 can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Like all Fox restaurants (except the new Culinary Dropout at Scottsdale Waterfront), this resturant is just ok, but not great. Starting with the decor, the restaurant is light and airy, with huge windows and lots of patio seating, which is nice. However, the decor reminded me more of a yacht club in the Hamptons than a spot in Mexico. Another big plus is that the hostess (who was friendly and upbeat) gives you a white or black napkins, depending on what you're wearing. I know this seems like a small thing, but if you've ever been given a white napkin while wearing black pants, you'll know the anguish it causes. To the food: As I said above, the food is good not great, but like all Sam Fox restaurants, its overpriced. Its not offensively bad, but its not Arizona mexican. There is just no excuse for serving mediocre Mexican food in Arizona, and this is the reason why I would not recommend Blanco. There are tons of great places in this city to try for upscale Mexican food- Barrio Cafe, and Gallo Blanco are my favorites. The salsa was the worst offender. Serving salsa that tastes like Pace Picante canned salsa is not only unforgiveable, but sets the meal off on a bad foot. Try again Sam Fox."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch on a very quiet Wednesday.  Chips and salsa 2/5  Margarita 2/5  Tried four different kinds of tacos, fish, steak, carnitas... 2/5  Chicken fajitas ok 3/5  Usually very happy eating at Sam Fox restaurants...Nice place, service was very good - food was not - unless you really like tex/mex style?"}
{"text":"Pretty decent spot, food is ok, a bit overpriced.  Bartenders were very good.  I'd at least recommend it to others to give it a shot but it's not my #1 Mexican spot."}
{"text":"We came to Blanco Taco at the Biltmore for Happy Hour. So glad we did. The dips are amazing and the tacos are delicious... Amanda was our server, and she was fantastic. Very attentive. I would highly recommend Blanco Taco!"}
{"text":"I first discovered Blanco in Scottsdale a couple years ago while in AZ for work. I was so excited to be coming back to Phoenix. I still craved the blood orange margarita with the sugar rim and the amazing food.   Tonight I made a reservation for 7 people at 7 pm at the Camelback location.  I figured as most restaurants I've been to that we would arrive and be told they would have a table for us soon.   Not the case here; I felt like a celebrity!!   I received a text message from Blanco at 6 pm and then when we arrived at 7, they had a table with a reserved sign on it fully dressed with chips and salsa waiting to greet us.   Well done Blanco!!  I was the only one in the group who had been before and the the food and service certainly earned 6 more fans."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants. Always good food, great drinks and good service. We always take out of town guests here."}
{"text":"I was asked to come back by manger after poor service.  The food and drinks are so good here and live atmosphere I had to go back.   Got the tacos and margarita and was so good.   Had excellent sever and had a great time.   Fun place to go."}
{"text":"I've always thought pretty highly of most of the Fox Restaurant Concepts, and Blanco is no exception.  Although I've never had very great service here (kind of slow and unattentive), everything I've had on the menu has been excellent and they have a longer-than-normal beer list, too.  The prices of everything are especially fair, considering the quality of food.  I think Blanco is a particularly good spot for groups.  The atmosphere always seems to be buzzing, and they have large enough spaces to bring several tables together."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and excellent service that stood out. Our table ordered margaritas, tacos, nachos, a bbq burrito, guacamole, queso and dessert....and I tried them all. Our entire group raved on how wonderful everything was. We were just here 3 nights ago and will be back again this week."}
{"text":"What great service. Our waitress Christie was on top of it. It was our first time at any Blanco location, not only did she take the time to go over the menu, she was made aware that one of us had a glutten allergy and educated us on what options would best suit our needs. She was timely, friendly and up beat.   The restaurant itself seemed great. We chose to sit outside and enjoyed happy hour margaritas (what a great value). We both had street tacos, I had the \"Award winning\" bbq beef and my partner had the fish. We both thought our dishes were great. The side of street corn was absolutely to die for.   Of course it being a Sam Fox restaurant the decor was lovely and everyone was super hip. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for great service, contemporary mexican and a great margarita."}
{"text":"We were out in Scottsdale on a Saturday afternoon, and we had read decent reviews of this place on Yelp.  I was amazed at how bad this place was! I am so tired of poorly executed places that charge a premium (for the category) and deliver poorly.  This place is really awful.  It tries to be trendy with the wait-team dressed in striped blue knit shirts that look like they have been washed a few too many times.  The food is fair to poor, presented in a heaped plating style that was not appetizing.  I had a salmon entree and my friend a chicken dish.  Neither was really special in any way.  Chips are good, salsa is not. Drinks are way overpriced.  The  \"house\" 'Rita was $8 and was small, really too sweet and totally unforgettable. There are many, many better places out there.  This one has a bunch of Scottsdale, tired wannabes as patrons (I agree with Jenny R.!), and an untrained staff.  Our waitperson was OK in the beginning, but she disappeared at the end.  Our final drink was served 10 minutes after we finished our meal, at least 15 minutes after we ordered it!  We almost called 911 to file a \"missing waitperson\" report.  Instead, $75.00 later (for three drinks and two entrees, tax and tip), we left and we will not be back."}
{"text":"I've walked by several times and always wanted to go in. Had great service from my waiter Doug who was a wealth of suggestions.  My new favorite drink is the white peach hybiscus margarita.  Not over the top but just perfect after work.  This place had a great vibe,  awesome staff with great training and knowledge. The management staff doesn't just stand around,  they get in and help out and let the staff be awesome and friendly.  We will most definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Came to Blanco on a whim and loved it!!!   We were greeted by two amazing hostess Dallas and Kat. My fiancee and I had our 2 year old with us and Dallas and Kat were so amazing with her and of course she ate up the attention.   On to our server Taj, he was phenomenal!!!! We had never been to this place and he made some amazing recommendations. We had the esquites it was a corn dish. It was to die for.   The next time I'm in Phoenix were defiantly coming back because of the food and the service!!!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the Blanco Window! $3 NACHOS, PEOPLE! The window serves little tacos, nachos, quesadillas, chips + dips, and tortas for about $3 - $5 each. I frequently order the nachos or quesadillas and ask them to add chicken or steak (an extra couple bucks) for a more filling meal. The cooks at the window have a tendency to go crazy with the cheese, so I always ask them to go easy. After you order you can eat your food on the colorful tables outside the window or on the grassy area in the middle of the Biltmore. If you are shopping at the Biltmore, and don't want to spend money and time on a meal, go to the Blanco window! The folks who work at the window are also super nice.  The actual restaurant has a good HH and margaritas. It's conveniently located at the Biltmore, but overall, there are dozens if not hundreds of restaurants in Phoenix with more authentic and flavorful Mexican food. If Fox put half the effort into Blanco's food as they do the restaurant's image, I'd recommend to a friend. I'd probably give the restaurant itself a 2 star, because at least the servers are wonderful and the place is clean."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our dinner here.  Our waitress, Veronica,was very friendly and had great recommendations. They have a great selection of margaritas and tequilas.  I had a taco combination plate with a crispy shrimp, BBQ pork, and chicken taco   They were all really good but I recommend the crispy shrimp.  And the street corn was really good too.  My husband had chili Verde enchiladas and he said it was excellent. My only complaint was the music inside the restaurant was a bit loud. Otherwise excellent service and food."}
{"text":"love this restaurant. ... this restaurant was great in my book, the service was fast, the waiters are excellent, the wait for our order was fast and on point. I recomend the carnada asada platter, it was fabulous.  taste like street tacos straight out of mexico or south america. I recommend that you try it."}
{"text":"What a rip off.  Way over priced for what you get.  Service was great but food was a far cry from great.  One word.... BLAND.  Don't think I will return."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food. Good drinks and service. Very crowded. Long waits. No validation for valet parking. Extremely high noise level - almost impossible to hold a conversation here."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Blanco for years... I was so happy when they opened this location. It has a different vibe than the Scottsdale location and I like it a lot better (also much bigger)! Tasty tacos, cool vibe and close to home - win/win/win in my book.   Service: I've never had bad service here. It can be a little slow when it's busy but that's expected and it's still never \"bad\" or unacceptable.  Food: I always get the warm queso blanco (just simple queso and so delicious... great price, too @ $3. I tried the street corn for the first time and it's definitely not anything to write home about so won't order that again... much better options. I love their salsas- they actually have three different ones (verse and a habanero salsa in addition to the one they bring you when you're seated). For gluten free, they'll fry your chips in a separate fryer. All tacos (with exception of crispy shrimp and bbq pork are gluten free when they're on corn tortillas). I can't pick a favorite taco because I truly love them all. Also, I LOVE the rice... always skip the beans and get all rice for my side!  Drinks: Both the red and white sangria are great... red is my favorite, though. I love the white peach hibiscus margarita! The mango habanero margarita is a little too sweet for me, but still tasty."}
{"text":"Checked this out on restaurant week. Great service. Awesome mexican chocolate cake. Plenty of food for whole family (brought along 5 y.o and 2 y.o who shared one kids meals with a ton of leftovers). Food is good not memorable but fun ambiance. We plan to go back for drinks."}
{"text":"I hope today was just an off day for Blanco. I met a friend here tonight at 7 for a drink. We have been here before a couple of times but it has been a while.   We sat at the bar and I was a bit surprised that it was as empty as it was. Especially with Game 7 of the NBA finals going on.   We ordered a drink and some queso. Before the drinks arrived we both looked at each other and mentioned how warm it was. It was 120* out today and a cold drink was just what the doctor ordered. Well, the doctor must have called out sick. Along with the AC guy. Yep. We mentioned the temperature to the bartender and he kind of chuckled and said 'well, our AC is broken. That's when we asked for the check and cashed out.   My Tito's and Tonic was weak. There was only half an inch of melted ice in the top of the glass and the drink was slightly room temperature. Their ice machine must have gone out with the AC."}
{"text":"This place is super fun - we had a girls' night here and it was a blast. Their margaritas are excellent, and the food was pretty good (though not super amazing, but it was more about the atmosphere and drinks). Great place to go if you're in the mood for something upbeat. Love that their bar is large but service is never a problem. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The Margaritas were awesome!!! Try the peach hibiscus - it's on the sweeter side but really good! I ate the carnitas tacos & you can order any of them with a hard shell; which I did. I was a bit disappointed with the hard shell because it seemed a little too prefabricated. I like a fresh fried tortilla for my hard shells. The tacos were still really great!  I really could have stayed all night for the margaritas, chips, salsa and guacamole though!! The place had a nice modern and hip atmosphere. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"upscale mexican food is hard to pull off but they do it well. TVs throughout the bar if you need to watch a game. The wrap around bar is nice and the vibe inside is first class, like all FOX concepts restaurants."}
{"text":"I'll never go back. Went here mid-afternoon (about 3-ish) so it wasn't crowded at all. There's pretty much nothing good I can say about this place except for the fact that the manager did come and apologize.   First...our server (I think his name was Nathan) was either stoned or just incredibly inept at his job. It took (and yes I timed it) 20 minutes before we ordered AND that was AFTER I had to yell at him and wave him down to get his attention. He literally walked by our table 4 times and looked to the tables on his right to help them (it was one table with, what I believe to be, other Blanco employees including a hostess, eating) and never looked to his left (where we were sitting) to help us. I finally had to yell \"Excuse me\" 3 times to get his attention. He came over somewhat befuddled and I said \"Can we order now?\". This should never happen...especially when it's not busy.   Next was the $9 guacamole \"Blanco special\" appetizer. Supposedly it has all these yummy ingredients and is supposed to be sooooo good. I'm about 99% sure it was just a bunch of avocados smooshed into a bowl. It tasted like nothing...just smooshed avocado. Blech.  Next, I got the spare rib (or short rib...can't remember) burrito. I took a bite and I seriously almost puked. It tasted like they'd poured an entire container of salt in it. I asked my fiance to taste it to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. He agreed it was inedible and just crazy salty. They did take it back and offered me something else on the house. I ordered the taco salad. Again, salt...a big salt salad. I didn't even bother complaining or sending it back cuz it was free and I was too grossed out at that point to even contemplate trying something else.   The only 3 good things...#1 The manager came and apologized for the salty burrito. #2 They took my gross food off the bill. #3 The FREE chips they bring you are pretty good.   So, moral of the story? If you go here just get the free chips and salsa. And don't expect to get them very quickly, especially if you have the same server we had. Personally, I'd rather eat at Taco Smell than go to Blanco again."}
{"text":"For a Monday night, man, this place was rockin'! There's not much in the way of lively spots near the Borgata, but Blanco injects a little bit of attitude into this quiet shopping center. The patio space is expansive, and it's a real relaxing atmosphere. They bump some strange, spacey house music, which feels a bit out of place, but it's not loud enough to be annoying or ruin the mood. The ceviches are excellent: try the big eye tuna or the crab and shrimp. The housemade gazpacho base is very citrusy and juicy, which really gives the meat some kick.   The chips are thick and crispy, but lack the seasoning needed. The salsa was fresh and peppery. The pureed tomato doesn't overpower for a good blend.  All the Sam Fox restaurants are solid concepts, and this one is no different. It's fun, hip, California attitude in the Valley and it's welcomed. Most higher-end Mexican spots are pretty cavernous and bland with no atmosphere to speak of, but Blanco is top notch."}
{"text":"We came here on another Yelp recommendation. The street tacos were perfect and the Hibiscus margarita was amazing. The service was exceptional and the staff accompanied my daughter's off menu requests."}
{"text":"Happy hour menu was very reasonable, a very nice dining experience this afternoon ... Bartender/waitress was very on the spot ... Wish they all were like her., try the ceviche ... Hit the spot"}
{"text":"I really want to give this a 4.5. I went Saturday afternoon and it really was not that busy. Maybe I missed the lunch rush or everyone was hiding from the heat. Nevertheless, Service was excellent. We sat at the bar and the bartender took excellent care of us. I had the the shrimp taco and pulled pork bbq taco. Both really good. A little slim on the serving size but boy did the tacos pack some flavor. Really good."}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed the food at the Blanco on Scottsdale road.  Typically order red enchiladas.  So yesterday we tried the Biltmore location and it was really disappointing.  Hostess seated us but then no one came over for over ten minutes. Decided to try the white peach hibiscus margarita. Sadly, it was syrupy and not worth 9 bucks.   My enchiladas were kinda gross. Chicken was watery, not juicy and cheese was piled on. The sauce lacked its usual kick.   Rice on side was like eating a stick of butter. Table chips were the saltiest I've had in a long time. My husband had fish tacos he said were \"fine\". He is much more enthusiastic about fish tacos usually.  Kids meals were acceptable for kids. Kind of odd they give kids adult size take out cups. Anyway, it's a nice ambiance. I'd stick to beer or wine happy hour but couldn't recommend this location."}
{"text":"The BBQ tacos are the best of all of there tacos, and the street corn is a must. The food here is really good, you really can't go wrong with any thing you order."}
{"text":"As huge fans of 80% of Sam Fox's restaurants (we don't eat meat), the Blanco at the Biltmore has a nice feel.  Normally we dine at their Scottsdale location and we miss Kelly Courson their Manager who moved to their newer Henry's restaurant.  The one thing we do notice at most of Sam's restaurants is that the Chef's seem to have different spins on their standard dishes.  Hence there can be disappointments and we have shared this at TFK in the past.  So of course there was a misunderstanding on a salad prep.  Marlo the Manager came over and could not have been more gracious about it all.    This while she was scratching her head why their Fish Salad comes as a chopped salad and the chopped salad does not.  Go figure!  Yet here is where Fox outshines most any other eatery here.  Their ability to attract talent and get these people into management positions is stellar.  Marlo was so earnest and  genuine in her TLC with us.  Outstanding !!!!  So yes there are some discrepancies, yet when the rubber meets the road, the Fox people are the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Black Chile was the name of the previous restaurant that occupied the space. Just a tidbit. Now to the review:  The hostess was very nice and polite to us and we were greeted quickly. A major plus in my book.  We really didn't have to wait on a Friday because a sit at the bar opened up...I am walking to the bar with my wife. My nose is assaulted with the worst smell, the smell that only comes from bars that make fruity drinks and use fresh ingredients.  I can't knock 'em but they need candles or something.    Too the food we go:  Salsa and chips. Check.  The salsa is legit.  I could order that all day.   Fajita's. Meh...salty, salty, salty. Good portion but you will need water.    Overall thoughts: I am trying to step out of my box because I am a creature of habit. Ya...I prolly won't go back."}
{"text":"I would eat here every damn night if I could!! Absolutely delicious food, perfect portions filled with flavorful goodness. Recommend the fish tacos and steak fajitas. Couple those with some Cadillac margaritas and you are set. Chef Alex couples amazing flavors with artful presentation. 100% chance I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is just MEHHH. I've had way better Tex-Mex and authentic Mexican at other places. Don't get the guacamole. It sucks. It tastes like powder mixed guacamole with water, sprinkled with tomato on top. It was so bad we asked the bartender if we could get something else, so we opted for the queso. The queso is okay. I had the braised short rib burrito and it was just okay. The meat tasted like it was pulled from a crockpot and put into an oversized tortilla and folded into a burrito. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come here again but it wasn't the worst place I've ever been. Definitely like the atmosphere of the restaurant and the vibes. It's super modern. But the food steers me away."}
{"text":"Hellooooo shrimp tacos!!!!  All I can say is wow.  The food is amazing and the chips and salsa are as good as I have ever had.  I am a big fan of the Scottsdale location primarily because of the patio and fire pits.  My wife and I go often and enjoy freshly squeezed margs and salty dogs.  Highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Love this place. My wife and I eat here all of the time. The tacos are my usual with rice and black beans. Today though I had the red chili chicken enchiladas and was blown away. Absolutely amazing flavor and a huge portion. I took half home for lunch tomorrow. There are two huge patios with heaters for the winter and misters for the summer."}
{"text":"I used to go here about once a month but I'm really not a fan anymore. The location is pretty good but the food and service isn't that great. The restaurant is always super busy (not necessarily a bad thing) but that means the service can be slow. The food isn't that great either....just not anything about it that makes it stand out."}
{"text":"The crab and shrimp ceviche is the best. Always great service and good selection of beers. I recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a casual yet trendy, yummy meal."}
{"text":"I cannot help but feel that the restaurant is over rated with all of the 4 and 5 stars.  The atmosphere is good like you would expect in Arizona with outdoor space that is occupied  The food is acceptable but not at all exceptional. There are no real hot sauces and the waitress informed us that they were all mild. So we added jalape√±os to everything.  My 3 Chicken tacos were ok but very small with little meat. Basically we paid upscale prices for street tacos. My wife's burrito bowl was mostly rice and beans.  The service was mediocre.  I ordered the tortilla soup as a starter and the waitress asked if I wanted it separate or together with the meal.  We clearly ordered it as a starter and separate. It came all together though....I asked the new server to please return it as we addressed in the very beginning. When they brought out the main course it was cold so they made no attempt to keep it warmed and just placed it out of the way.  Water came plentifully but when we ordered additional salsa it took quite some time."}
{"text":"Great tacos! Loved the carne asada taco and short rib taco! The street corn is amazing too. Very busy on a Saturday so make a reservation. Chips and salsa to start were fantastic!"}
{"text":"Swanky Scottsdale taco shop.  Nice looking place in an upscale area.  Looks aside unfortunately the food was not what I was looking for.  You can usually judge a taco shop by its salsa and guac.  The guac here was very vanilla.  It was almost pure avacado with a tiny bit of cheese and tomatoes on top.  It could have used some jalapeno, lime, salt, and zest.  The salsa was similarly lacking both heat and flavor.  It tasted like blended tomatoes with a tad bit of chiles and some garlic and salt.  They played it too safe for an experienced palate.  I had the bbq tacos with rice and charro beans.  The tacos were tasty but incredibly small.  When I say small I mean I didn't realize they made totillas that small small.  The beans were good and the rice was probably my favorite out of it all.  Very good flavor, nice texture.  Moist without being wet.  Well done.  Unfortunately, the price is on par with the area instead of the food.  I'm sure rent isn't cheap here so you probably already know what you are getting into.   If you are looking for mild food with a nice ambiance then Blanco is for you.  If you are looking for authentic, good price, and some heat then keep on moving."}
{"text":"This place is always upbeat and consistent. The servers are on top of their game and always in a good mood. I have tried most things on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. On the weekends they usually have a DJ playing an eclectic genre of music. The service is fast and the margaritas are on point! This place host new style Mexican food and over all clean ingredients used in the food. Even times when they are busy you can arrive with no reservation and be seated in a reasonable amount of time. This is a environment you cam bring kids for dinner, but can become noisy and with a lot going on. Try this place out you will not regret it. My favorite dish is the fajitas! if you are looking for less food look at the taco selection. This is one of my favorite Fox Concepts."}
{"text":"Have tried this place three times now. And only once have I met a staff member I liked. Our server this time was older, bubbly, and knew what she was doing. When came in on a late sunday afternoon, it was fairly slow. We told the hostess that we'd like to sit on the patio and she happily obliged. She took us out and tried to seat us directly next to a couple that seemed to be deep in conversation and enjoying each other. The seating on the patio is pretty tight, but the whole damned thing was empty! Why would you seat us right next to the only people on the patio? My boyfriend laughed a bit and asked if we could grab a table that was not on top of theirs. The hostess got a bit of an attitude and seated up a couple rows down. I've also experienced attitude from their bar as well. I was rushed to place my order, rushed to order a drink, and rushed to pay, with not even a glimmer of positivity or a smile from anyone working the bar. It was so awkward! The food is pretty good, menu isn't very large. Drinks center around tequila. Their margs are pre-mixed and varied, their not totally terrible. I probably won't be visiting again. There are much better options in that shopping center."}
{"text":"Favorite taco place in Scottsdale.  Slightly pricey.  Great cocktails."}
{"text":"This spot has a pretty cool vibe and really easy to walk in and quickly get a seat on a Tuesday night.   I had the tacos carnitas, classic margarita, and clase azul neat. The tacos were very good with some tangy zing to boot due to the seasoning and peppers. Good chops and salsa. My guest had the burger which looked delicious.   The atmosphere was great and we were able to enjoy the meal and chat no problem and the service was just right.   Prices were pretty reasonable especially when compared to the bay area."}
{"text":"Yum! We came here on a Sunday night after spring training. This place does now take reservations but they do call ahead. If you're hungry, I'd call ahead! When we got there, the wait was 1hr 15min. It went by pretty quick because we got some drinks. Th I cocktails are great!!!! My sister got the pomegranate margarita which she loved and I got the mango jalape√±o. Both were amazing!!!! The chips and salsa were also great. The service  was ok. Not great. Our server kept disappearing! We started with the street corn which was great. Served off the cob. We got 2 separate tacos! We did the BBQ pork and the short rib. Both were great but the ours came out missing crema on the BBQ pork which would have added a great element that's almost necessary. The butter rice is awesome and hard to stop eating! I also have to point out that I pretty much micro managed the bartender to make me a skinny jalape√±o margarita and it was phenomenal! So if you love a spicy marg, have them muddle a TON of jalape√±o into the skinny marg! YUM! I would be happy to come back here!"}
{"text":"Having that urban chic warehouse idea that doesn't give hint with cliche regional Mexico decor towards the modern Mexican food to be found is quite nice. Large white washed beams, iron round cage industrial lighting and wood slat raised wall details reminiscent of the 70's offers the modern Scottsdale atmosphere you hope to find in the area.   Okay, enough of the eye candy. We're hip and happy with atmosphere (although current dance music pumped at overwhelming levels making any form of normal conversation very difficult needs to be dealt with, it was so loud it's one reason for the loss of a star) but what of the food.   Like any Mexican restaurant worth its salt chips and salsa come quickly to the table. Hand made, thick and crunchy and a nice thick pur√©ed salsa with small heat are standard but good.   Our group ordered a variety of tacos and chicken enchiladas. I chose three barbecue pulled pork on flour tortillas. Done in a street taco open face style when they arrive to your table. The pork was tender, well seasoned and included slices of pickled red onion (apparently all the rage right now? It provided a nice tart pop to the more mellow but full pork flavors. A tad on the dry side, but the beans were saucy enough I was able to spoon a little to each taco. The enchilada was layered like lasagna and quite tasty and felt unique. The rice was a bit off for some in the party as it seemed like it had been mixed with butter perhaps. I didn't mind and found it rather tasty.  Other taco places I have sampled and go to regularly offer true a la carte portions and more unique flavor combinations (\"Moms Ortega taco, barbecue pork with fried pickles, Philly cheesesteak tacos, even mashed potato\"), this is a good sampling and does offer numerous options if you want  to try Mexican food in a more modern but easily recognized style."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been debating whether to give this joint 3 or 4 stars. I think it deserves 3 stars because they omit some of the ingredients of the dish and when my food arrived I had to ask them to remove one of the ingredients not mentioned.  That being said, my girlfriend loved it. The food was very good and the outdoor seating was nice.   Overall, I do recommend this place, just make sure you ask the waiter for all the ingredients in your food as they might omit some in the menu."}
{"text":"Stand-out Mexican food in the Scottsdale area. Ordered the bbq pulled pork tacos, hands down, some of the best I've ever had! Margaritas were strong, not too sweet, and well worth the price. Will eat here again before leaving town!"}
{"text":"Good food and service but disappointed that after sitting outside my son & husbands khaki shorts were ruined as red paint rubbed off the metal painted chairs. Reported it to the manager who didn't offer any compensation, just that she would report to the GM."}
{"text":"Luv Blancos & come every time we visit Scottsdale  Great taco combinations and yummy cocktails  Great location & fun atmosphere  Try calling ahead bc there is usually a wait"}
{"text":"Well, I guess like many have said this is a Fox restaurant so you get a very nice atmosphere.  I think I remember a quote from Mr. Fox that (and I'm paraphrasing) a dinner out isn't about the food, it's about the experience. By that standard Mr. Fox did well with Blanco.  I personally think the food is a big part of the experience, I could even argue it's the biggest part.  Not that the food was awful by any means but I wasn't really blown away by any of it.  Machaca tacos were okay, buttered rice was simple enough but hardly Mexican, ceviche was alright.  Are you noticing a trend here? Motto of the story kids, is that I'll trade the foo-foo surroundings and high Borgata prices for a dump off 19th Ave. someplace and the food is killer. I don't think I'll head back here any time soon I'm afraid."}
{"text":"This place actually uses fresh lime juice in the margaritas and that is exactly why I keep coming here. They also have a great happy hour at the bar.  I never can believe how cheap my bill is when I pay.  During HH, a chicken quesadilla, a margarita, and a 25% tip gets me out the door for less than a 20. Not bad!"}
{"text":"Average size gluten free menu. Tacos and enchiladas are all I've ever had. Staff knows what's up.  Margaritas are decent. I've had better and I've frequently had worse.  Chips are light and crispy. Salsa isn't spicy but isn't too bland tasting either. Guacamole is good.   Tacos are good. Enchiladas are good. Charro and black beans are good.   That rice needs help though. It's an oily greasy, tasteless mess.  Though I'm not wowed by the food I do find it tasty and fresh and fairly priced."}
{"text":"Guacamole with no cilantro white onions jalape√±os? Anyone can crush an avocado Fish tacos plain and not enough cabbage for texture or lime spice Margaritas in a water glass? Where are the cool glasses? Lite on the liquor, too. Also, work on that salsa. However nice place and hot servers!!"}
{"text":"Well, once again I celebrated my birthday at Blanco tacos (at the Borgata)and had a very relaxing and wonderful experience. The food was exceptional as well as having been waited on by staff who were experienced, efficient and friendly. Meghan, (assistant general manager) took time from her busy work schedule to welcome us with her sweet smile and kinda persona!! Thank you all for making my day special."}
{"text":"Made my debut here for happy Hour with a group. Great deals with most all drinks and appetizers half price. The blood orange margarita was about 4 bucks and it is made with all fresh juices which is a huge bonus especially at that price. I guess I could have ordered food, but the chips and salsa were free and bountiful. Salsa was average, no spice, but chips were fresh and crisp. The patio was nice as well. The only caveat is this is part of that Sam Fox empire, the restaurant king of Phoenix, so if you don't feel like greasing his already deep pockets (14 places or so), head elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time here, and love the atmosphere! The quality and the quantity of the food was perfect, for a great price! Just disappointed that the food wasn't spicy enough. If you have a crave for spicy food like me..then this will not be your favorite taco place!"}
{"text":"This place is great for happy hour if you like margaritas.  I love the blue decor.  The cheese crisps are great.  Kind of a little older crowd though like late 30's-50's.  I prefer my 20 something places but all around good food and drinks.  I would go there again."}
{"text":"Many of these places seem to offer bland food but their kitchen whips up a well-seasoned dish. The guacamole is flavorful and so are the other dips. I had the slow cooked bbq tacos and it was solid (taste on par with street taco tacos). Only complaint was that the chips were not warm but otherwise I would/will eat there again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently went there for July 4th to celebrate and gorged ourselves on two appetizers, two taco plates, and two drinks each. The street corn appetizer was the most memorable - a mix of creamy, spicy, and well, corny! And it was shucked so you could eat it from a bowl to not get the fingers dirty! I will never pay a visit to Blanco again without ordering the street corn!  We also took advantage of their 25% off discount that I had received via email as part of the Fox Restaurants mailing list, which claimed the 25% off applied to the entire order, but when we got the check, we found out from our server that it only applied to our entrees. It only ended up being $7 more than we expected but we were still disappointed about the misleading offer.  I wrote to the manager about this situation - not requesting money back or anything but just asking for clarification in future such offers. To my surprise, he immediately replied asking for more information to get to the bottom of the situation. After locating our receipt, he apologized, offered to refund my card. Furthermore, he mailed me a $25 gift card for my troubles! It was really no trouble at all, and I never even expected a response from the manager, much less a gift card!  It's this exceptional customer service that makes me respect businesses like Blanco. They really care about the customer. We would have come back anyway, but the gift card gives us a special excuse!"}
{"text":"Finally tried some main courses and now we are hooked. Enchiladas - these are baked into a small cast iron skillet and topped with cheese. It is kind of like a Mexican baked Ziti. The filling was that good short rib and it was served with charro beans and good rice with corn. Unusual style, but great meal...$14 Fajitas - long strips of marinated white meat chicken with at least six corn tortillas. Onions and peppers were also present, along with some guac and sour cream. The chicken was the star as the meat was just so flavorful - $17.  Otherwise, the chips were free and crunchy served with a thinner type red salsa and great service, but they do close at 9pm on weekdays, so during tourist season, it is best to arrive after 7:30pm for a short wait for a table."}
{"text":"Bar seemed overwhelmed with the steady lunch crowd. It wasn't busy in the whole restaurant just steady..... the salsa was good. The green chili burrito was ok. The charro beans were way too salty. The white rice was my favorite on the whole plate. The Dos XX Amber was cold and yummy, would have liked another one but after waiting 7+ min for A bartender I said forget it. Several minutes later my friend met me and that's when the bartender (little older & blue eye shadow) came to ask him if he wanted a beer when he said no she walked away with out giving him the chance to ask for an ice tea. So I just paid and left. What a first time experience"}
{"text":"Allow me to be an asshole for a moment while I write this terrible review. Maybe its because it was Monday, and raining.. maybe it was because I was in the mood for Humble Pie and not Mexican grill.. maybe its because restaurants in Arizona don't have the freshest sea food in the United States of America, whatever it was, I hated this place.   I have this habit of asking my server what their favorite thing on the menu is.. and usually I go with it. I am adventurous, I like surprises.. So homegirl suggested the nachos or the Seared Ahi tacos.. so what do I do? I ordered a taco plate. Since I like variety, I mixed and matched and went with a fish & pork taco with black beans. The Ahi tasted wicked old and nasty fishy. I almost spit it out, but I am a lady and that is rude. The pork was very undercooked.. I don't know about you, but I have absolutely no interest in catching Trichinosis. I can think of better ways to spend my day than with nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, fever, and abdominal discomfort.. sorry those are not things I am interested in, thanks anyway though. Beans were served cold and I swear the rice they served was something out a box from the dollar store. My dog could make better rice than that. There was shit floating in my water and the limes I asked for were so dried out that not one drop of juice came out. Seriously? Cut up some fresh ones.. its the little things that count.   Service was slow, but the chick was nice enough. One of the girls I went with knew one of the managers, who was supposed to hook us up with an employee discount, but conveniently forgot about us at the end.. but what are you gonna do, nothing is free anymore.   I dunno, I just wasn't impressed. The only thing I dug about this joint were the tiles on the wall.. and im certainly not going to return to a place to stare at a wall.   next!"}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out with friends when you need to lift your spirits up. The prices in their happy hour are great! Great place, food, atmosphere & the prices to help you save a little cash is always great."}
{"text":"Nothing Rapido about this place and it's a total rip.  If I'm getting an $8 side salad or a $3 meatless taco I should at least get it in a reasonable amount of time.  Just order carry-out from the restaurant and get the adult portions in half the time for only a few bucks more."}
{"text":"The place always has a wait and we have gone in and left because we couldn't even get a spot at the bar a couple times. We tried again but went in later and the bar had plenty of seating. The bartender was so friendly and knowledgable. Made suggestions and was flexible with any changes we wanted to make. Food was really good and the drinks were unique. Jalape√±o mango margarita made my breath smell for a day but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends before heading out to old town to club and it was incredible. Everyone ordered something different and we shared - and ALL of it was amazing. From the enchiladas to the fish tacos to even the rice and beans. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food so this is saying a lot.   The place itself was absolutely gorgeous, from the exterior to the interior. The seating both outside and inside is comfortable (we had moved from inside to outside seating just out of curiosity). Outside was nice because they had heaters since it was Winter, so we thought we might freeze but it was actually very comfortable. The chairs and couches were really nice as well and they had fire pits which you could dine next to (I loved that part).   The bathrooms were beautiful and clean and the service was also great.   It is a bit pricey but everything is delicious, so it's a give and take for sure.   The good thing about this place is that it's great for dates as well as friends and family."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this restaurant and the staff were very welcoming. The tables and seats were very clean which is rare in some other places. The food is great!! I love their grilled corn I would definitely recommend them. I had the shrimp, chicken, and carne asada tacos each one was better than the other. The shrimp and crab ceviche was also excellent. Overall, great experience and I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Seems like this Sam Fox guy can't do a bad restaurant!  Chips and great salsa. Many different tacos on the menu. Came here during happy hour and toured the menu with my friends. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place was really loud, but I assume that's what trendy, great happy hour places are all like these days. We were able to get happy hour at our table and had a reservation. The Blood Orange margarita was delicious!!! I had 3 tacos- BBQ, Fish and mushroom. The only one I wouldn't get again was the fish, it was too fishy for me. The tacos are pretty small- street tacos basically. Come with beans and rice. Loved the flavor! Great experience and will be back. Good Mexican food is not easy to find in the Phoenix metroplex."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing!  I had the ceviche and the shrimp tacos. The blood orange margarita was also pretty good. The service was fast and friendly. I would definitely come again and recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Been to Blanco's several times. The pick up window outside is great. The staff is nice. This review is mainly for the food served at the dine-in area. The apps we had have always been good. We decided to order meals today and they were absolutely horrible. There was so much salt in the food, chips, and salsa that we didn't finish our meals. Basically, salt with a side of Mexican food. Disappointing waste of money :("}
{"text":"Lunch, last Saturday, was pretty much a complete flop.  First let me say that the food was okay but only just. I had a nice piece of salmon, excellently prepared BUT the accompanying \"fresh gilled vegetables\" were served in such a fine dice, it made both taste and identification impossible.  Who dices grilled vegetables? My dining companion chose three tacos, different varieties, and also thought they were good.  Disdaining the rice and beans, she was informed that she could have two \"sides of your choice.\" Side No. one was (unfortunately) the same indecipherable grilled vegetables, previously mentioned; side two was Mexican Street corn, that - while good - did not live up to what is served in various other restaurants, plus she was charged extra.  Not a big deal but no mention of it was made, by the server.  The REAL disappointment was in the cocktails.  A margarita?  Oh no, it wasn't! Mine was ordered on the rocks, NO sweet and sour, extra lime.  They actually got that part right BUT where was the tequila? My companion ordered hers frozen and if I thought my cocktail was light, hers was a barely-flavored sno-cone.  Attempting to fix this, we asked the waiter for a shot of tequila. He offered to bring us the menu and began extolling the merits of various brands, when we halted him and said no, just the Cuervo Silver, same as in (?) the cocktails.  He returned with not one but two shots - which actually turned out okay, as they were both needed. The original cocktail was priced at $8.50.  The shots were $6.00 apiece!  For Cuervo! Anyhow, that brought the price of each cocktail up to a whopping $14.50.  Believe me, there are a lot better places to go, that serve superb no-doctoring-needed margaritas, for less money.  The bartender - let me rephrase that - the person behind the bar (who looked about 12 and what was with the pen, behind the ear? going for nerdy?) lacks training and experience and that bartender presence, that only comes with knowing what you are doing."}
{"text":"This place gets one star for its service. I never got to try the food. I was part of a large party that made a reservation. We were asked to wait while they waited for a party to finish up and would call us.  We patiently waited for our table. They accidentally gave our table to another large party that walked in after us without a reservation. Our party left and went next door for a more pleasant experience."}
{"text":"The service is amazing. I don't know what's in that rice but its addictive. I have had several of the tacos, corn, the salsa is amazing and I think I've eaten my weight in guacamole."}
{"text":"My first visit to Blanco was one that I will remember for awhile. I'll begin by saying that the food was good. I had the machaca beef tacos and a margarita. The beef was very flavorful with just the right amount of spicy kick to it, and the margarita (I had the frozen variety) was decent too. That being said, it was rather pricey ($11) for two tacos, rice and beans. I've had better for a LOT less.  Now, I must shift my review from food to the atmosphere. I've got a story to tell, but please note that this story in no way reflects the quality of the restaurant or my feelings about returning. I just want to share the hilarity of my evening and to give you an entertaining reason to visit Blanco.  We all have preconceived notions about Scottsdale. I tend to stereotype the people that live and play in this part of town as snobby, snotty, stuck-up, and whatever other \"s\" word you can think of. Of course not everyone that lives or frequents Scottsdale is like that. However, the night my friend and I visited Blanco, that stereotypical Scottsdale crowd was in full effect.   I'm not sure if Blanco has a dress code for women, but it seemed like this Saturday night it was a requirement to wear as short a skirt or dress as possible, along with crazy high heels.  Oh, and it appeared there was a height and weight limit too -- nothing over 100 but taller than 6'. Maybe there was a model convention in town or something.  I have nothing against looking hot. In fact, I think I hold my own. I just was amazed at the amount of skin that was exposed in one restaurant. Being from the rather less cool NoPho area(and even less cool because I used that dumb abbreviation), I guess I didn't get the memo that this was the required look now.  The eye candy was entertaining to say the least, but I digress.  There was even more fun-filled antics to come. My friend and I were seated next to the bar and about 1/3 of the way into our meal, three 40-something guys were seated behind us.  They were drunk and annoying. I had my back to them, but my ears were tuning in to their conversation, and I heard comments like, \"Oh, she's a six.\" \"Yeah, for sure, a six.\" \"Oh, does she have a snaggletooth?\" Then there were the expletives,  the redundant \"dudes\" and the constant references to going to Vegas. Oh, and did I mention that my friend, who was facing them, was in full view of their overtly ogling of every miniskirt, tight-jean wearing chick that walked past them.   But that wasn't all. No, the \"dudes\" weren't quite happy enough with their caveman-like behavior. After they finished their meal, the middle guy I like to call King Douche asked the bartender if he could have the chef come out. Oh, boy, I thought, this is going to be good. Out comes the chef, who seemed nervous and annoyed at the same time.  King Douche began to rave about the food in an inebriated and slightly incoherent rant. Although I couldn't hear everything King Douche was saying, I think he said something about the food being really good.... but... then went on to criticize almost everything he ate, telling the chef something about having too much of this ingredient here and not enough here, and that he has been a restaurant manager, and it's important to hear the good with the bad, and on an on.  The poor chef stood there kind of dumbstruck.  I honestly don't think he knew how to respond.  He kindly thanked them for eating there and suggested they come back again.   I'm so glad that I wasn't facing these schmucks because I wouldn't have been able to keep from expressing my disgust and amusement. Instead, I just laughed with my friend while cursing their insipid behavior.  In the end, and despite all the young wannabe glamor girls and midlife crisis greasy creeps, it was a memorable dinner at Blanco.  I will likely give the place another try. But next time I'll come prepared to watch the antics with a little popcorn and candy."}
{"text":"Best service I have had in a LONG time! Holy amazing is what this staff is. Our food arrived in less than 15 minutes of ordering, the drinks were prompt and our waitress checked on us the perfect amount of times. And the food was amazing too! Dinner and dessert - both amazing. I really dig this place and hope to hit it up soon again. I can't stress how fantastic the staff were!"}
{"text":"Average at best, very bland flavors.  Guacamole was really salty, salsa was basically tomato sauce.  They were out of the first tequila I tried to order.  Service was meh, felt like we were a hinderance to our main server and the guy that actually brought our food out just dropped the plates on the table and walked away.  Will not return, no need to contact me."}
{"text":"Fox Concept Restaurants pretty much never let me down.... this place was delicious!   I really liked the atmosphere and the chips & salsa and tacos were great! I ended up getting the short rib tacos and they were super flavorful and mixed really well with the corn rice on the side.   I also had the guacamole as an appetizer and it was HUGE. So much deliciousness and they make it to order so you can get add or remove ingredients you like/dislike.   Chips are free and bottomless and they are so so good. They're served warm and salty and the perfect in-between of crunchy and soft. One of my favorite parts of the restaurant!   I'm excited to come back and try more of the tacos!"}
{"text":"I was greeted by a very friendly hostess who directed me to a table on the patio.  It was 76 degrees outside and the heater was blaring over the table.  I asked if I could be moved, which she did no problem.  The hostess gave a few suggestions since I had never been before.  I ordered the braised beef and avacado cheese crisp.  How tasty and unique!  Very nice blend of meat, avacado, cilantro, cheese and tomato.   A bit on the salty side, but the hot sauce accompanying it toned that down.  I absolutely LOVED the sangria, although at $8, it was a bit over-priced, but tasty nonetheless.  I ordered a second cuz I'm on holidays.    If I lived here, Blanco probably wouldn't be a big deal.  But it is set just outside Borgata, a great shopping attraction.   I loved the patio, the staff were friendly, the food and drink very good.    For someone escaping winter and wanting a patio, tex mex and a nice setting, this will do the trick."}
{"text":"Food is great, but don't expect many refills on your beverages, or great service unless you are running up a big bar tab. Happy hour prices seem like more of a suggestion as compared to an actual price. All in all it wouldn't be the first place I'd take my out of town friends, but could do a lot worse then Blanco"}
{"text":"Located in same area as True Food Kitchen, convenient parking. They try to encourage the Cheese Crisps but they are nothing special, just like a cheese quesadilla with different toppings. The main dishes are not classic Mexican but interesting combinations and variety"}
{"text":"Blanco Tacos seems like a great place to enjoy happy hour ... inviting bar that allows you to sit outdoors or indoors, great happy hour prices for both drinks and food... And then there is reality.  I sat down and the bar and was greeted by the bartender, who offered me a dinner menu, asked what I wanted to drink, and asked if I wanted chips and salsa. I ordered a beer in an unfrosted glass, and said I would love some chips and salsa. The beer came as promised. Props for having Torpedo on tap.   Another couple sat down next to me, were greeted by a bartender, offered the happy hour menu, drink specials, and chips and salsa. The other bartender then came over to me and offered me the happy hour menu when there were now six minutes before the end of happy hour.  And she asked if I wanted chips and salsa.   The first bartender came back over, and I ordered one of each of the happy hour tacos, and asked if I wanted chips and salsa. Third times the charm right? Wrong...  I did get my happy hour tacos, a second beer at happy hour prices even though the hand had swung past the witching hour but never received chips and salsa. The tacos were very good. Hand made corn tortillas, great fillings. I especially liked the beef with the chipotle. And the carnitas with the salsa verde were very good too.   In the restaurant industry, attention to detail is what is important. I do not fault the bartenders. They were personable, gracious, and truly represented the business well. I fault the management of this location. You never allow your staff to become this sloppy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a girl rlfriend. I wanted to rate it higher but we both had the chopped salad and they were terrible   Both tasted like they had been sitting around for awhile and that was even with the dressing on the side. We both found the ends of romaine lettuce which should have been discarded, in our salads! Not good.  Our waiter was nice, but next time someone asks him about the chopped salad I hope he knows not to recommend it."}
{"text":"Food and Drink 1. Cheese crisps ROCK, especially the \"cheese only\" option. 2. Main courses are okay, nothing special 3. White sangria was very bizarre.  Tasted more like fruit punch than wine. Glad I had a sample before I ordered. 4. Happy Hour-- appetizers (including cheese crisps!) are 1/2 off.  Service 1. Wait staff appears to be very inexperienced.  After ordering, my server said, \"there has been an accident in the kitchen.  Someone cut their finger\".  I was expecting to be told my Blanco cheese crisp was going to have a special red sauce, but then he continued, \"I have to take him to the hospital, so Buddy will take care of you\".  Atmosphere 1. Nice open restaurant with awesome patio.  Great for the cooler weather, built in heaters throughout. 2. HUGE bar in the center of the restaurant, great for those creepy old Scottsdale guys who like to check out the chicks.  Misc 1. Their plates are so heavy, they can be used for either Frisbee Golf or as a weapon. 2.  I have never seen so many trendy gay men in my life (they were either gay or severly metro sexual)"}
{"text":"This was our first visit and we will definitely be back for another happy hour. There are great food and drink specials during happy hour which runs daily from 3 to 6 PM.  We opted to sit at the bar which was a good choice.  The chips salsa and dips were excellent, tacos were great, and the quesadilla was pretty simple but tasty. The red sangria was good and the beers were cold and cheap."}
{"text":"The food here is southwestern style and was pretty good. Nice atmosphere with the exception of the local 1 man band. Great salsa and chips and very nice servers. The lazy tacos I ordered were good as were the chili releno was very good with the green chili sauce. It is a place worth trying"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is nice and we had good service but the food left much to be desired. The guac and street corn were probably the highlights and much better than most of the entrees. I'd come back for 1/2 off HH, but not for full dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place never have had a bad meal yet and the service is just as good. The prices are really good for the size you get and best tacos in that area."}
{"text":"Blanco Tacos is a place where culture, food and originality collide into a masterpiece of a restaurant.   I have now been to Blanco's several times, and every dish I've had so far has been excellent. The food is a new age Mexican with an American twist to it.   Personally, the side dish of rice that comes with the entrees could quite possibly be the best rice I have ever tasted. Moreover, the servers that have attended to me at Blanco's have all been kind, enthusiastic and knowledgable. If you have a question about the menu, they will have an answer.   Through and through, in my opinion, Blanco's is one of the best modern Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"My spouse and I are in town visiting and were looking to go somewhere for dinner. I looked on yelp for reviews and we decided to come here. WOW. This place did not disappoint. The staff is friendly and on their A game. Our waitress suggested a few things we tried, all of which were delicious!   Chips and salsa are brought to your table. The salsa has the perfect amount of a kick to enjoy while conversing and waiting for your order.   We started with the machaca and avocado cheese crisp, delicious! The meat was perfectly cooked, tender, moist and perfectly seasoned. The portion is that of a large tortilla. We didn't finish it so we could have room for our dinner. Hindsight, we could have ordered this and split it and it would have worked perfectly.  I ordered tacos. It doesn't say it on the menu but our waitress told us you can mix and match if you would would like to have different kinds and not three of the same. Which is exactly what I ended up doing. Carne Asada, was wonderful and probably my favorite. BBQ slow roasted pork, if you like BBQ sauce you'll like this. I wasn't expecting the sauce and it came off far to sweet for me. However, with the roasted corn, pickled red onion, red jalape√±o... The flavors and textured combined are really good, just not what I expected. The third I ordered was the Machaca because of how much I enjoyed it on our starter.   The red sangria was a bit tart and my spouses classic margarita tasted like a glass of mixer with no tequila. (both of them)  All in all a very good dining experience. If we fly here again we would come back."}
{"text":"I've been a customer of Blanco's for quite a while now. It's a go-to place for girl's night or a quick bite with my hubby. Unfortunately, Blanco has lost both my husband and I as patrons.  On a recent Saturday night, we were craving a delicious cheese crisp and pitcher of sangria. After we had learned our lesson on weekends past, my husband called ahead for seating and we were informed it would be 45 minutes. No big deal and nothing we didn't expect.   An hour after our call in time, and waiting in the restaurant for 30 minutes, I approached the hostess asking where we were on the list. She informed me it would be just a bit longer and they were working to get us a table. Half an hour after that, no table. I politely approached again and it was clear that we had been skipped, marked off the list and forgotten. The hostess stated the next table would be ours and to give them just a few more minutes. When I went to sit back down, the couple sitting next to us were seated. Infuriated, we both decided it was time to leave. My husband gave our pager back and the hostesses stood there like deer in the headlights. They said sorry but made no attempt to make the situation right.   I find this type of thing to be completely unacceptable. We were patient, understood there would be a wait and still chose to spend our date night at this restaurant. In return we were greeted with lousy customer service and no table. On the plus side, we discovered a new restaurant right across the way we have been to multiple times now. Thanks for the help, Blanco!"}
{"text":"Wow! We ordered so much food and just had to finish it. It was delicious and the team was most welcoming and friendly. Our waiter, Richard, knew exactly what to recommend and made our first experience a unique one for sure. We ordered a braised rib/avocado cheese crisp, green chili pork enchiladas, sopapillas, flan, guacamole and the seasonal vanilla cinnamon margaritas and nothing was less than excellent. Andre genuinely cared about our experience being a great one as well. He seemed to be very connected to the guests and his team. Considering the newness of this location, I'm quite impressed as they perform as if they've been here forever. Even the staff that was not immediately responsible for our table was smiling and checking our table.   I recommend ordering both the flan and the sopapillas and dipping the spoonful of flan into the sopapilla honey. Yummy! Maybe they could serve with local honey drizzled over the flan.   The pricing was very reasonable as well. I would have expected to pay more. Don't get any ideas though.   I would highly recommend this restaurant. Thank you, Blanco! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Nicely swank place in Scottsdale that has pretty good drinks and some pretty massive food dishes.  It kinda felt like it was along the lines of PF Changs but a lil classier and of course a different cuisine.  We were there a bit later so it was pretty empty but I can't say too much aside from the fact that we got a nice little buzz and filled up on food pretty well.  The guac was a little small though for the price, but otherwise it was nice enough."}
{"text":"Perfect choice for a relaxing Saturday lunch! It's a little loud but that's  because it's comfortable and vibrant with lots of energy!!! the foods starting with the salsa and chips are delicious. We had  the roasted corn appetizer which sounds simple but is delicious. Our waiter Jake was friendly and took care of us. I loved their skinny Margarita. My husband ordered a hamburger he said was ok. I ordered a grilled yellow tail salad. They were out of the mahimahi. It was delicious, lots of smoky grill juicy flavor!  We had the chocolate cake for dessert. But it wasn't cake it was a dense cheese cake! Which was very good and rich we could only have half. YUM  I loved it and can't wait to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Great place to come out with friends for dinner or just a nice lunch ...  Food was great and customer service was great ...   Try the Fajitas so good ..."}
{"text":"a 5 for atmosphere, a 3 on the food since it was pretty typical. a 4 overall.  And we have and will continue to visit and sample the menu."}
{"text":"Tacos are life, so when I decided to cut out carbs to lose a few pounds, I mourned the loss of my favorite food. Business brought my here, and I just assumed my options would be limited. Enter our lovely bartender, who started making AMAZING suggestions - want tacos? We can put them in a lettuce cup!! Guacamole and salsa? Let's get you some sliced cucumbers! In short, the food was great and the service was excellent. I highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"I just love this place. Casual atmosphere so great hang out place. Music isn't too loud allowing for great conversation. Windows are open making it like one big patio. Alex and Chelsey have been very friendly, quick with our orders and very knowledgeable in their recommendations. One of my friends has never been here and they were quite helpful. I've always had great service here    Their guacamole is amazing. A definite must-order. Their food is very good for the price. I'm a fan of their tortilla soup and flan as well.   Margaritas? Great! Today I had the Blood Oranje and the Peach Hibiscus. Both great. They put a monthly special out too. This month is cinnamon vanilla. Sounds odd but very tasty leaving a sweet vanilla aftertaste in your mouth.   I recommend Blanco to a lot of foodsies and friends and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Sam Fox gets it right again with the Fish Salad - chopped cabbage, avocado, radish, jicama, grilled salmon. Lime vinaigrette on the side. #healthymexicansalad #perfectlunch #heaveninscottsdale #foxconcepts"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area I try to go to Blanco. I love the atmosphere and the margaritas are delicious, I recommend the blood orange. I've always had good service and good food. My fiance would say the portions are too small but he's a big eater."}
{"text":"This place has awesome service, experienced bartenders and good vibes...  My visit today is worth a 4 Star review alone for the happy hour special $5 Jose Cuervo Margaritas. I ordered a few just to be honest with y'all, and each drink was smooth and strong. They have a heavy poor which i dig, plus they have some great chips and salsa   To eat I had the pastor chicken tacos, hmmm I probably would get another type next time, lots of flavor but I should stick to what I know lol.   Oh and this place is clean, employees didn't feel rushed or panicked and has a diverse crowd of ages 17-55 pretty cool to see!   4 STARS"}
{"text":"Were there a few weeks ago with friends Not bad place, but there was too loud)) a lot of people, no available tables, we were staying at the door about 15 minutes, and then they gave us menu that was dirty)))  funny))  After this place my dress smells like a kitchen. I dont think we go there again."}
{"text":"After a couple of years we decided to try this place again. Service from hostess and waitress was very good. Kitchen seemed quite slow. Wine list is reasonably priced with adequate selection. My wife loved the tortilla soup.  I notice last time we reviewed she didn't.  She disliked the chopped salad though couldn't define the problem.  We have always liked it before. I had nachos with short rib. The cheese sauce was a strange consistency, with an unusual chili taste. The meat was ok but the overall taste was not good. I got halfway through. In the past the food seemed better. I am not trained in culinary arts and my professional writing isn't as a reviewer but we go to lots of restaurants. I feel there was a problem yesterday. We like Fox restaurants so don't understand."}
{"text":"I've been her several times and thought it was average until I tried their Street Corn and Tacos. Seriously so good. A must try."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with 3 others. The salsa served as soon as you sit down is so good. We got guac and queso and those were delicious as well. I got the watermelon, mint margarita which was very refreshing and great for a hot day. My main meal was the pork tacos. Meal was very filling and couldn't actually finish it all. Laid back atmosphere and friendly wait staff. Meal was served quick and I have no complaints and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This place is your typical high ceiling, ostentatious, characterless place with pretty girls and pretentious people that one would expect to find in Scottsdale. The food is good but uninspired, the service is awful as others have mentioned:  the kid behind the bar was too busy talking to the other servers rather than attending to customers. She's pretty and thinks that she'll get good tips just based on her looks?  In other words, this place is a Phoenician's dream. Fox concepts (could be called Phoenix concepts) fits in perfect in a city lacking any culture or character. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Had Happy Hour on Monday at the Borgata location. Loved the appetizers.The ceviche is outstanding.  Had the Quesadilla with Chicken (very good) and the tacos with pork. Delish! I had the berry margarita. Loved it. My husband has a beer.Beer was OK. There are better brews in Phoenix.  Service was very good. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite trendy Mexican restaurant. I love the taco trio and the rice is simply the best. No kidding, this is the best Mexican rice everywhere. People there are nice, beer is cold, delicious food. I love it!"}
{"text":"So, came here for lunch on Cinco De Mayo and it wasn't busy which was perfect. Also, guess what! We made it for happy hour.   Drinks were a good price I think $3-4 for a beer and the mixed drinks were cheap too. There were three different types of tacos to choose from for happy hour; chicken, beef, carnitas. Listen, here me now, DO NOT SLEEP on the beef tacos. SO GOOD.  The chicken tacos were basic and the carnitas were a solid second place. The guac, salsa, and cheese dip were a great appetizer though.   One thing, am I crazy for not wanting cabbage or radish on my tacos? I feel like I see it places and I'm just like, hey can I just have lettuce??? Anyway, solid restaurant. Very happy it's basically across the street from my house. Hopefully I will come back."}
{"text":"Went in for a nightcap and an appetizer.  Good beer selection but a awkward vibe to the place.  Blanco seems like it can't decide if it is a swanky Scottsdale place or a mid-range taco joint."}
{"text":"Tacos Tacos Tacos. Come to Blanco for Tacos y Tequila!  We came on vacation.  It was walking distance from my hotel. I didn't know, couldn't tell if it was a chain.  But it was hella crowded.  We had to wait 45 min for a table for 4.  Luckily my kids were on good behavior and they gave us chips while we waited.  Also, we ordered margs from the bar.  They were good! Go for au natural with the agave syrup.  So much better than mix.  Much better flavor.  Sort of like a skinny but without the soda water.  YUM.  Once we finally were seated, the service was very pleasant and somewhat quick. the kids both had a kids taco plate.  I had the Mexican chopped  with steak.  The steak was awesome, very good.  Well cooked.  Hubs had the short rib tacos.  He said, there were, \"OK.\"  Also, the place is VERY loud.  I suppose that is what you get when your motto is tacos y tequila, right?  Food 4, ambiance 2, wait 2."}
{"text":"On a recent afternoon, fresh from the airport, a coworker and I arrived here. We decided to start with some queso with chorizo because we were starving and awaiting our other colleague and also queso is never a bad call - right?   They don't technically offer their queso with chorizo and their appetizer menu is generally a little complicated, but they were accommodating and willing to answer all our questions.   When asking the waiter what was most popular, they said the tacos, which you can pick individually from their list, so we went with those.   The tacos come with a side of rice and beans both of which lacked flavor. It would be so easy to offer some flavor to the rice and beans - using cilantro or peppers and would definitely take this to the next level.   Overall this spot is really good and has great service. They also apparently have a great party room downstairs."}
{"text":"Great and friendly wait staff and delicious salads! There Mexican Chopped Salad is reasonably priced and delicious! There chips and salsa are also good and they have a good happy hour.  Just a fun and convenient place to grab dinner."}
{"text":"Yummy margaritas and chips! The quesadilla was delicious, too, though a little different than the usual ones you get in restaurants (flatter without any sour cream or quacamole on the side - but I don't usually eat that stuff anyway). Didn't try any of the other food but I definitely will the next time I'm there. I loved the \"upscale, casual\" atmosphere and inside/outside dining. Go there. You won't be sorry...unless you don't like Mexican food."}
{"text":"I wish we had half scores   More a 3.5  Meal enjoyable. The salsa served with chips was  pretty mild. The chips were really good, not thick. Thin and crispy   The blanco salad with meat was okay The added on meat was not on the generous side. Would suggest you ask for it on the side   It was a kind of spot the piece of meat\"  The lettuce was a closer to room temperature than cold. I like my lettuce to be cold when served   The short rib machaca burrito was good, has great flavor and was very filling"}
{"text":"I went for happy hour and was pleased with the food and service.  I agree with some of the past reviews that the food is nothing special.  The guac was good, but I prefer the Guac at the Mission.  There is something special about it made at your table with your choice of spice.  The fish tacos were average.  The ceviche was good.  The service was great.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Always checking in on us and offering additional drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped by with some friends on Sunday and was not disappointed. Our server was amazing and made sure to make suggestions from each category of the menu. He checked on us multiple times throughout our meal and took time to ask us about our weekend and carry on small talk. The amazing food was just an added addition the the service! I had the cheese enchiladas and street corn as my entree and guacamole and queso as an appetizer. Great portions on everything and their chips are amazing! I believe I filled up on chips before receiving my food but it made wonderful leftovers!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a lunch on a Friday!  Had some great food and wonderful drinks (good tequila + margaritas)... Its the way to get the weekend started!  Bright, vibrant atmosphere.  Chips are deadly (i.e. can't stop eating them!).  Will repeat!"}
{"text":"Your run of the mill, fox restaurant. Clean, quick and friendly! We are here on a Friday night, requested a patio seat and they were able to get us (a party of 6) in quickly. The waiter was helpful and our waters were never empty. They also allowed us to order off the happy hour menu despite sitting down a minute or two late.   They also were so accommodating to a dairy allergy and offered to make our table a fresh batch of guacamole sans diary! Wonderful!"}
{"text":"Great lunch place for street tacos, chips and Margaritas.  Really nice open atmosphere that is a must.  However we tried the sopapillas for dessert and these were over fried and dry.  Other than that highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  From the service, to the chips, salsa, and queso, to the incredible tacos we loved it all!!!  The crispy shrimp taco was out of this world.  Definitely on your must eat places."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!! We showed up at 9:45, they closed at 10. I told the hostess we would go because I understood they closed in 15 minutes, she insisted that we come in because they are open to 10 and to take our time. So we told her to just put us at the bar.   Bartender was wonderful as well, he was very friendly. He made us great drinks and got our food out very quick. We were visiting on vacation and he was telling us about great places to check out.   Overall very great staff, amazing food and drinks, and a wonderful experience. Definitely coming back the next time we come to Phoenix."}
{"text":"After a  horrible day and work week, my husband and I decided to try out Blanco (the Biltmore location) for dinner.  We had been to the Blanco on Scottsdale road on a few previous occasions, but decided to venture to this location instead, to see if the experience would be any different.  My husband, baby daughter, and I arrived around 530 and the place was busy, but not yet packed. We were seated immediately and greeted by our waiter, Nathan.  To begin, we ordered a pitcher of White wine Sangria and a Chicken Quesadilla appetizer. Our waiter came back a little while later with our drinks and a basket of complimentary chips and salsa.  After about 25 minutes or so, the manager and our waiter came back to apologize for the wait on our appetizer and promised it would be out soon. A couple of minutes later our Quesadilla came out and about two minutes after, our dinners arrived as well.  The manager (I can't recall her name, but she was very, very nice) apologized profusely and offered to take our appetizer off of the bill.    My husband and I had both ordered the House Specialty (Shortrib) enchiladas- it's what we order every time we go. A few bites in, I noticed that my rice was quite mooshy.  I had intended to just eat around it, but my husband decided to mention it to our waiter, when he came back to check on us. A few minutes later, the manager arrived with a new side of rice and again apologized.  Our waiter then came back and stated that we would be receiving a free dessert for the inconvenience.  All in all, although there were a few minor hiccups, we would definitely come back because the degree of customer service that they provided was really commendable. Our server, Nathan, was fantastic and so too was the manager who came by to check on us.    Thank you for helping to make a horrible day/ work week better!"}
{"text":"This spot just doesn't do it for me.  Flavors fall short.  Vegetables are over cooked and soggy.    The service is fine. The location is nice. Overall the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and of course first impression is a lasting one. The server came right away to our table. We ordered guacamole with our chips. The salsa. chips and guacamole were really good. The margarita was really good. The three carne asada steak tacos, black beans and rice were excellent.  The service was spot on, and the waitress gave us salsa refills and fresh chips without having to ask. The only thing to improve and the reason I gave four stars instead of five was the flies inside near the windows kept annoying us and trying to get their dinner portion. The restaurant needs to keep the front door closed and figure out a way to control the flies inside the restaurant. But overall excellent food, service and ambience. I will go back but will not sit next to the window."}
{"text":"Short Version: If I had to rate FRC restaurants, this one would fall somewhere in the middle. It's good, not great. Nothing unique. We got the Beef \"House Specialty\" Enchiladas and the Crispy Shrimp Tacos and it was good. If you're deciding between these two, I'd go with the Crispy Shrimp Tacos.   Long Version: My wife and I came here for lunch the Friday after Christmas and it was one of the only places that wasn't completely packed. We hadn't been to a Blanco in a very long time over at The Borgata, which I'm not even sure it's there anymore. We decided to try it again despite not remembering if we liked it or not the first couple times we had gone.   The menu appeared to be the same, and I only remember that because it's a pretty typical Mexican restaurant. I'd compare it to a Fuego Tacos but with nicer and cleaner decor. The decor is what you'd expect from a Fox restaurant. The service was good and attentive.   We were served chips that were really salty and I like salty so I know that means they were overly salty. Not sure if that's a consistent thing or not.   I ordered the Beef \"House Special\" Enchiladas which came out very hot (not a bad thing) in their cast iron pot. Along with it came the Charro Beans and some rice. The enchiladas were stuffed with cheese, ancho chiles and short ribs. The Charro Beans were pinto beans with bacon pieces. My favorite part was the rice. Not sure what's in them, but it's kind of like a sticky rice with some herb seasoning. My wife got the Crispy Shrimp Tacos which also came with the side of rice but she got the black beans instead. I think I liked her tacos more than my echiladas. It's definitely the lighter choice.  All that said, Blanco is nothing special. It's not bad and it's not awesome. Very middle of the road to me. There are other placed I'd like to go before coming back to Blanco. Maybe I'm just annoyed because I have to be at work today so I'm writing a grumpy-town review, but there's just nothing great to say about the lunch I just had. Nothing terrible to say either.   I just thought of a good way to describe it: As I was at the half way point of my Enchiladas and wasn't hungry anymore, but also not full anymore, I decided just to stop eating. That is to say, if a meal is good, I'll keep eating until I'm disgusted with myself and if it's bad, I wouldn't have made it to the halfway mark. This is probably how a healthy human being should eat anyways. Maybe this place is good for me after all."}
{"text":"Great food and freindly service! Luv this place I had a shrimp taco plater with charro beans with rice"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Great music and overall vibe! Would definitely come back again! Highly Recommend the tacos and the desserts."}
{"text":"Blanco is delicious! My family and I came here the first time after my sisters bridal gown shopping! We all ordered different margaritas and a bunch of tacos, quesadillas and appetizers to share. Everything was good and I am fairly picky! The blood orange margarita is TO DIE FOR!   Go indulge in some tacos and margaritas here!"}
{"text":"After a day of pool crashing at the Princess, my friends and I were hungry.  We drove down Scottsdale and ended up at Blanco.  We were still technically in our bathing suits and as the sun set I felt extremely under dressed for a Saturday night.  Don't mind me, my ass is only wet because I was at the pool all day... I swear I didn't pee my pants.   We sat at one of those communal tables, which I always enjoy.  Some nosey old lady kept grilling my friends on things like iphones and tattoos.  It was entertaining.   The service was great and the manager even got us a seat way before the quoted 30 minute wait.    I had the short-rib enchiladas and highly enjoyed them.  They tasted a lot like the enchiladas my ex's mom used to make.  So, it's nice that I no longer have to date him just for his mother's delicious Mexican meals.  The rice is also pretty good, but a little different- it's creamy and corn adds a hint of sweetness that I really enjoy, even though it can be a bit salty for my taste.    I won't hate on Fox restaurants just because it's a Fox restaurant.  I usually enjoy myself at all I've been to and if the food is just okay, well, at least there is plenty to look at.  Hell, I love Julio G's so you probably shouldn't listen to anything I say."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the worst dinner services I've had in a long time.   Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday, about 12 people all together. The waitress was mediocre at best. We had to ask her for more chips, salsa, and refills on water. She was hardly paying attention to the table. She took forever to take our order. When we arrived the restaurant was steady but started to clear out. Everyone arrived between 730-8pm. So by the time we ordered the restaurant was pretty dead, maybe 8 tables if that were there with what seemed to be a full staff.    I ordered a mojito, a classic drink, when it got to my table it tasted and looked horrible. There was no muddled mint in it at all, it looked like a dash of chopped mint.  And the taste was horrid, it tasted like a bad sweet n sour mix. I sent it back and asked for their berry mojito. That was just as bad. It had 2 black berris in it. Again no muddled mint or even muddled berries. It was bad! I didn't even want to send it back again because I knew it was going to come back horrible.   By the time the food came out everyone was pretty hungry. However that became an even bigger issue. Half of the tables food was just warm. Not even hot! So my friend caught the waitress and asked her to warm up her cheese crisp, and pointed out that half the tables food was cold. The waitress said she'd have a new one made for her and sent the manger over. He came over and she stressed that half the tables food was cold and was very dissatisfied. He apologized and said he'd take care of it. They brought her out a new plate, everyone else sat there and waited with cold food in front of them. After about 10 min of waiting, my boyfriend caught the waitress and expressed his unhappiness with her service and then expressed his dissatisfaction with the food being cold, she specifically said that everyone's food was being remade. After waiting another good 10 min he caught the manger and asked where the food was. The manner has no idea what he was talking about, and said he never promised to remake food. At that point my boyfriend was furious. He stated how is it they would remake one person's food, but not the rest when they were specially pointed out too. Also how could they possibly send out like warm food when the restaurant was empty! The manager had no explanation.   A complete waste of time. I will never be venturing back to Blanco tacos. The food was mediocre. The rice was full of butter, no other flavor, it felt like I was eating a stick of it. The charro beans had no flavor. A complete let down from Fox restaurant concepts."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time for my brother's birthday. Evening started out not so great but ended on a very high note. Started with a very long wait on busy Saturday night in Scottsdale. Expected but hostess failed to explain we would be notified by cell phone text when we checked in. Gave her my bros cell but we had no idea this was their paging system that was not explained to us. After almost an hour wait when told only 3o minutes brother finally checked with hostess as too why so long. Turned out we Never received text saying our table was ready. Couple comments about that: creative idea using text but problem is not everyone has a good cell phone. Second we weren't told this was the system to notify us. Third the music was way to loud! Even if text had arrived we would not have been able to hear the alert come through on a phone even turn up to high volume. Suggestion: if someone does not respond to cell phone text Page Them next!! That wasn't done though we heard other groups paged.  Turn down the music!!! This is a restaurant where people want to talk and enjoy the food. Not a bar or dance venue!! Subtle music makes for better ambiance people!!   Okay bad first impression aside the rest of the evening went well. Our server was super attentive and she was working other tables and one right next to ours with a very large group. By the way we sat outside in the patio which helped to decrease having to shout at each other over the overpowering music. the food was amazing! Even the salsa which can be The food was amazing! Even the salsa which can be very bland at Mexican restaurants was flavorful and not too spicy.  Kudos to the chefs!!! We order the seasonal Coconut, Pineapple margarita's. They were very good. Not sure why a Margarita would be seasonal since that is usually a staple at Mexican restaurants. It's winter too so tropical ingredients and seasonal again didn't make sense but whatever they were good and we each had 2. Our nacho appetizer was a HUGE portion! Brother ordered House Specialty Enchiladas and said they were best he had ever eaten. I ordered chipotle shrimp soft tacos with black beans and rice. Everything was delicious and ample portions. Doggie bags were a necessity!   I must comment about the hostess that came to our table to check with us about our experience. Sorry pretty girl with long black hair I forgot your name,one too many margaritas. She was amazing! We let  her know right away about the unhappy start to our evening and she went above and beyond to make it right and even gave us my brothers birthday dessert, a Mexican chocolate cake with ice cream top which I had already ordered, on the house!!  By the way you must try this cake!! It's pure heaven for the taste buds!! What could have been a really negative experience, good food or not, was turned completely around simply by going that extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction. Nice touch management keep that up!! We will be back."}
{"text":"Five stars for: considerate service.   I have a food sensitivity, to corn. The level of sensitivity has been increasing over the years. At first it exhibited itself in the corn starch of egg drop soup. But as time has passed I find more and more corn associated food items result in producing in me the symptoms of a diabetic attack: heart palpitations, sweats, nausea, some cramps and general malaise.  I arrived at Blanco for happy hour and ordered the guac (nutritious and tasty) and cheese dips. I asked my server and later the deliverer whether there were any alternatives to the corn chips, explaining my allergy. I was advised there was not, so I requested some flour tortillas to be served with my dip and they were.  As I was tearing off pieces of my flour tortilla and spreading it with guac, contentedly munching on my repast...Shane, one of my bartenders, noticed and approached asking in a concerned tone whether my chips had not yet been delivered. I reassured him that I had declined them and explained why.  Shane and Nikki are the bartenders who attended me that evening. They are both satisfactorily attentive and courteous. Additionally, Shane...well he is pleasant to look at.  Shane returned a few moments later to discourse again. He commented that he too has a corn allergy. He asked whether my allergy was severe enough to cause problems eating something fried in the same grease as corn. It is not (yet) and I responded as such.  A few minutes later, I was served a bowl of fried flour tortilla chips."}
{"text":"So in love with their street corn and Blanco salad! I can never get enough- tip if you get them together and dump the corn on top of the Blanco salad - it's amazing all as one!   Then no need for adding chicken b/c it's quite large at that point.   Maragarita? Yes definitely- they know what they are doing for sure so don't miss out!"}
{"text":"Im a fox restaurant fan Just finished a work party of 10 all separate checks. Arriving different times and had great service.  The short rib Nachos are the best great bartender a true artist"}
{"text":"I got a recommendation to come here from the hotel I was staying at because the margaritas are supposed to be good. So, during a break from the conference I was attending, my friend and I came here for happy hour.   I got my typical margarita - mixed berry. It was pretty strong but still really tasty.   Our bartender recommended we get the dips to snack on as we chatted and drank our margaritas. The queso and the bean dip were both really good, and my friend really enjoyed the guac (which I'm not a huge fan of in general).   If I wind up back in this area, I'd definitely try out this place again on the sole fact they can make a solid margarita."}
{"text":"Being a native Arizonan its hard not to succumb to the ever lasting call of sweet sweet Mexican food, And let me tell you Blanco quenches this ever lasting thirst brilliantly! At least for the next few hours! The quality of the beef is fantastic! I mean to die for! The enchiladas are fantastico! I think Blaco even compares to the classic choices in town like Jordan's and ajo als. If you're looking to satisfy your rampant Mexican food addiction, look no further."}
{"text":"Delicious! Was at the Biltmore late one night and had been wanting to try this place. So glad we did! The food was really good, prepared with fresh produce and our waiter was extremely kind and very attentive.   Also a cool atmosphere, definitely a place to try."}
{"text":"Yeah! This place is goooood. So good that I have never gotten past the starters. hahaha I highly recommend the ceviche. It always tastes so fresh and guilt-free. The nachos with the chicken is yummo and perfect for sharing. Plus, you're getting your proteins, right? hahaha And what else can I do but try the margaritas.....touch down, so good. So go stop by. I always enjoy sitting on the patio or the booth/table that's right by the window/patio. Good servers. Very clean and put together. Now....I think I'll go there tomorrow for lunch. lol"}
{"text":"The restaurant is part of a group of restaurants that is turning very chain-restaurant. The restaurant is very clean and the food will come within 2 hours which is the free parking limit. I ordered the green chili pork enchiladas with black beans and rice. The presentation was interesting as the enchilada came in a skillet but the food was just average. No real flavor on either the beans or the meat. The saving grace was that the enchilada sauce compensated for lack of flavor. The prices are on the higher end.  I do not feel the need to return as I can get a better value for a better price elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not your standard joint with the greasy walls and greasier servers. This place is very clean and caters to the modern experience  Excellent sangria, amazingggg skinny margaritas (so the regulars have got to be the bomb), and highly recommended 'Mexican' food.  Ceviche and cheese crisps were good but not stand-out. Highlights were still the main courses, the green chile pork enchilada in particular."}
{"text":"I came to this blancos for the first time on Thursday for lunch with my aunt. We shared the crispy shrimp tacos and chips and salsa. I definitely was not disappointed in the tacos, they were amazing! Blancos never lets me down with their delicious menu!! Also, if you park in the paid parking lot.. Bring your token in and give it to the hostess to get free parking!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale! We always plan a night around a visit to Blanco's when we visit from Chicago.  Food & service were both excellent.  We can't wait to return, hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the food, and we're picky about both! We had the fajitas and chopped salad, both were awesome. Chips and salsa were also great. The openness of the place made it seem cozy even with 5 million people around. Gets busy, but is nice. Waitstaff was courteous and kind, not fake.Would go there again in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Blanco on Scottsdale Road a bunch, but went to this location for the first time. I went on a Friday night, and it seemed pretty busy, but we were able to get a seat on the patio very quickly (the patio was great for people watching!).  Our server was very attentive. He brought drinks, chips and salsa right away. The chips and salsa are amazing - the chips were very fresh and had a nice dash of salt, the salsa was a nice consistency and just a little spicy.  I normally order the slow cooked barb-b-q pork taco ... you MUST try these. The pork is tender and sweet, there are pickled onions that add a nice tang, mmm! This time I tried the Mexican chopped salad - it was pretty good, and a very large portion. To be honest though, I will probably stick to the amazing tacos the next time I'm here."}
{"text":"our waiter was awesome!   i had the steak fajitas and they were totally over priced at $18 but some of the best fajitas ive ever had!!! i didn't eat any of the sides or tortillas because the meat portion was so large and that was my favorite part.  (that's what she said!)    this is a fox concept i will happily, HAPPILY go to. scrumptious."}
{"text":"1st time at Blancos.  We had lunch and loved it.  The shrimp fajitas were excellent, enough for two. Too bad we had to drive 45 miles in the crazy Valley traffic!!"}
{"text":"I must say that I really love most of the Fox Concepts restaurants.  Blanco Taco didn't live up to my expectations.  It's Americanized Mexican food.  I would describe the food as bland, tasteless, unispiring and forgettable.  The service certainly didn't meet the standards I see at all the other Fox restaurants.  My friends and I will not be returning to Blanco Tacos to eat."}
{"text":"First time visit with my dear friend and the atmosphere was amazing and the appetizer and drinks were great. The best experience was the server Nick! He was so attentive and completely knowledgable about the menu and the TEQUILA!!!!! I didn't have to look for him one single time he was there always stopping by with a smile to see if we needed anything. Being a business owner I recognize amazing customer service and every visit back to Scottsdale I will surly make a trip to Phoenix to come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was quite a pleasant surprise!  I have been a fan of Fox concepts for a while, and was excited when I heard they had a new taco and tequila spot.  Our light lunch very quickly turned into an all afternoon affair peppered with cocktails, tacos and dessert galore.  We started with the guacamole, which was very fresh and flavorful.  For entrees, the three of us each ordered a different taco plate, and we all shared, which was the way to go.  We had the Carnitas, Carne Asada and Shrimp.  Although the Carnitas was great, the Shrimp tacos took the grand prize.  They are battered in a Negro Modelo batter and fried.  The sauce pairs perfectly, and the salsa is perfect.  For dessert, we tried one of everything.  I was a huge fan of the flan, which was extremely light and perfect consistency.  The chocolate cake was insanely rich.  The bread pudding was awesome.  All that, and I haven't even got to the best part- the tequila!  I enjoyed delicious Paloma's throughout the meal, and my guest had margaritas.  We were all quite pleased.  We also enjoyed a nice Don Julio 1942 to top everything off.  The cocktail list is diverse and full of fresh ingredients.  The tequila list is extensive and well-rounded.  I highly recommend their patio if you have an afternoon (and a healthy budget) to waste."}
{"text":"First timer - really loved it. The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I wasn't a fan of the queso - and I'm a HUGE queso fan. Very think and flavor wasn't great.  Salsa - amazing. Mexican Street Corn - amazing. Chop salad - Amazing.  I'd be back any time, but I'll skip the queso and try the quac.  Cool vibe, great drinks, cozy tables."}
{"text":"The husband was on the look for some good taco's this weekend and suggested we give Blanco a try! I was hesitant at fist. I just wanted something simple and close to home but I'm so glad he we made the drive over. We got here around 7:30pm Saturday night. I don't believe there was a wait but we went and sat on the patio part of the bar top because it was so nice outside and we are bar people. Our server was super informative and very attentive. I feel like he read my mind the entire time. To start he suggested the BRAISED SHORT RIB & AVOCADO Cheese Crisp, something we were thinking about. This thing was HUGE. I think we could have just split this for dinner. Lots of juice short rib, cheese and avocado. To drink I had the TROPICAL PINEAPPLE Cinnamon Infused Tequila, Pineapple, Mango, Fresh Lime, Pomegranate Drizzle. This was almost pure cinnamon. I didn't taste any of the other flavors noted. Luckily I am a big fan cinnamon and wasn't mad at it. After eating 1/2 of our starter and ended up getting a few tacos. I had the CRISPY SHRIMP: Pickled Onion, Fresno Chile, Guacamole. The shrimp kept its crisp and had a nice flavor and the Pickled onions was the perfect pairing. And their award winning SLOW COOKED BAR-B-Q PORK: Roasted Corn & Tomato Slaw, Pickled Onions, Crema Fresca. A sweet take on pork tacos. Very flavorful and I really enjoyed it.   We had a really great date night with some really great food. I'm excited to come back and try some more tacos."}
{"text":"If you're looking for happy hour advice look no further...anything else...look away. I can only speak on the happy hour aspect of this place since we tore it up here for their amazing happy hour! We started off with getting some super low priced happy hour margaritas that weren't your basic margarita in a glass. I got the hibiscus flower which was up there as one of my personal favorite margaritas I've ever had! I topped that off with a pint of a local Mexican lager which was also delicious. I personally didn't get to try much food but I did get their happy hour nachos. The nachos for the price was actually pretty filling and for the price not your basic $4 nachos! I will definitely be back here for happy hour if I get my Mexican food cravings and I find myself in this part of Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Blanco is the perfect casual, laid-back atmosphere to grab some great food and drinks... however it may be a bit TOO laid-back.   Went here to wind down on Sunday night shenanigans with my girls, grab a few drinks and some food. It wasn't too busy around 7pm, and we got seated right away. Our waitress came over and introduced herself, and asked our drink order. We didn't know which margarita we wanted right away, however our waitress recommended a few, and we made our choices. We also ordered water, because let's face it -- we live in AZ. We were all chatting and getting caught up in our conversation, but we did notice that our margaritas made it over to our table before our water... a bit out of the ordinary. Then we had to ask for water again before it was brought over -- maybe she forgot?   We didn't order much since we wanted to get together more than anything; I definitely wasn't impressed with the service though. The food was okay... we got some chips and salsa, and ordered some guacamole to go along with it. We also got two Mexican chopped salads that were pretty good. The service was fairly slow overall, and not very on-point. Not sure if we went on an \"off\" night?  I might stop by Blanco again, perhaps for a drink at the bar, but not quite sure I'd do dinner there again. Sorry."}
{"text":"First impression... all I need to say is Snottsdale hostesses! I showed up at Blanco on a Tuesday night at 5:40 with 10 girls.  The patio and the dining room were half empty and the hostess said she needed a few minutes to get set up, understandable.   After about 15 minutes another hostess came over to ask us what we needed.  Meanwhile people are walking in and getting sat immediately.   Then we see a server pushing some tables together on the patio and setting up the table for 10 people.  Five more minutes go by and we were more than annoyed, so we decided to seat ourselves at that table.   Once we got seated, our server was friendly and attentive.  Average food, average drinks... I ordered a pomegranate and grapefruit margarita, the juice was supposed to be fresh squeezed, but I it tasted like pure sugar.   I ordered a taco salad with no meat and it was so drenched in dressing that I couldn't even eat the lettuce.   Two girls who ordered a different salad and actually sent theirs back for the same reason.   The other meals that came out to the table looked much better, so maybe I just made bad menu selections."}
{"text":"I am impressed with this restaurant when I first visited Phoenix back in March 2017 with my boyfriend. We have been back a few times since my initial visit. :)  My first impression of the restaurant is that it is nicely situated in the Biltmore Fashion park. Upon entering the restaurant, you'll immediately be sucked into the warm, rustic environment of Blanco. It is a nice departure from your standard Mexican/Cantina type of restaurants. The decor is simple and modern. The restaurant is quite spacious as it has a large indoor as well as outdoor seating. For those doing private parties, they also have a private room downstairs which has its own bar.   My boyfriend and I were immediately greeted by the hostess. When we were seated, it did not take the waitress long to ask for our drink orders. One of the highlights from this place is that the bartenders are excellent mixologists. I am originally from Atlanta, GA and I have had my fair share of fine dining and drinks. I tell you what though, these bartenders at Blanco know what the hell they are doing. I always order their Sangria or Margarita and it is always mixed to perfection. Not overly sweet or salty. Just perfect.  I usually get the warm queso dip which I love because it is flavorful and not too salty. Ask for jalape√±os if you like it kicked up a notch. One of my favorite dishes at Blanco would be the street style tacos. My recommendation would be the Crispy Shrimp,  Red Chile Chicken, Baja Chicken or Carne Asada. You can't go wrong with either one of those, but those are just my personal preference. Also worth trying is the Red Chile Chicken enchilada which comes in a small skillet, piping hot that is covered with delicious cheese and the red chili sauce. Just a piece of heaven for those that love a good enchilada!   Finally, I tried their dessert menu because why not? I tried their chocolate mousse cake with vanilla ice cream. I asked for strawberries on the side. The chocolate cake is perfectly moist and has a right bit of sweetness to satisfy that crazy sweet tooth of mine!   Best of all, every time my boyfriend and I have went to Blancos, we have had great customer service and I think we have had all of the waiters/waitresses at some point or another. Now, if I go there by myself, it may be a different story for which I will update."}
{"text":"This was a surprising find.  I have overlooked this place for a long time, what a mistake. I went with a girlfriend during the week, it was still happy hour so we ordered the dips and a ceviche as well as some margaritas.  The margaritas were really nice and the ceviche was spectacular.  Big chunks of crab meat and shrimp, it tasted so fresh.  We also ordered chicken and steak fajitas, it was incredibly large.  Can't wait to come back, I want to have more of that ceviche."}
{"text":"Went here this evening and had the crispy shrimp tacos, and all I can say is OM NOM NOM! Also, the beans are delicious, but the rice is so out of this world, that next time, I may double up on the rice. Also, do yourself a favor and order the guacamole to start with (though they do top it with tomatoes, which makes me sad, but is totally a personal thing).   Another couple we went with got the carnitas burrito and loved it as well.  To top it all off, our waitress (though now I have forgotten her name, of course) was absolutely delightful.   The sinks in the bathroom are also really cool, if any of you are into that :)"}
{"text":"Last Saturday , my husband and his best friend and I went here for a late afternoon lunch for his birthday celebration. That was my husband first time here. Zack was our server and he was absolutely amazing. He recommended couple drinks for us and we ordered what he offered. The blood orange was really good. We had tacos too. I like the BBQ pork tacos the best. Since it was my husband bday, Zack offered a free dessert. It's quite nice. Thank you Zack for making my husbands bday lunch wonderful. We will definitely come back !"}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot! Very good restaurant for lunch with some darn good service. The inside decor is very \"Miami.\"   The chips and salsa are a nice alternative to bread to start the meal. We ate on a nice outside patio eating area which overlooked the Borgata shopping area. The service was right on on the money and they were very knowledgeable of the menu.   I ordered the burrito and was very happy with it. It was something that definitely filled me for the rest of the day. It was stuffed with beans, rice, lettuce and TONS of carnita's. My brother ordered the chicken quesadillas and really enjoyed them.   I'm a fan. Next time I am in town I would definitely come back to Blanco. Although it may not be typical \"Mexican\" food its darn good."}
{"text":"The husband and I put this place on our list to check out during our trip to AZ for Memorial Day. First off, complimentary valet? Alright! We were seated at our table really quickly, despite it being a Saturday around dinner time (although we did have a reservation, so that probably helped). Our waiter was really nice, and helpful answering menu questions we had. I ordered their classic Margarita (which was nice, decent amount of alcohol- some places tend to short you, and you're left with more mixture, if you get what I mean). Anywho, we had chips and salsa for our app, followed by the entrees. It took no time at all for our food to arrive which was great. I got the 3 (award winning!) BBQ pulled pork tacos with rice and beans, and my husband got the carne asada burrito (not enchilada wet sauce style). Food was awesome! The meat was juicy and tender, the sides were plentiful and filling. Perfect amount of food and the quality for the price (in my opinion).   Overall, A+ for service and food! I guess I'm so used to the restaurants in Los Angeles taking forever to get the customer served etc, that the extent of service here was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. If I'm ever here in the near future (or the next time I'm in the area, rather), I definitely plan to visit- highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went last night... had the fish tacos while my husband got the machaca burrito.  Both were awesome.... the fish tacos were super yummy and I'm a big fan of the rice.  It's kind of more modern... definitely not your traditional mexican restraurant.  The service was decent but nothing to rave about.  All in all we'll probably be back in the future."}
{"text":"The four stars are for Blanco's Summer Happy Hour.  We had a long community table for my friend's birthday.  Since I'm not really a drinker I can only review their food...great happy hour prices on tacos, nachos, quesadillas and dips/guacamole!  Our overwhelmed waiter did a solid job of keeping the chip bowls filled for our table of over 15.  Although, when the time to pay arrived, he was a bit flustered.  Two dedicated servers would have enhanced the flow of delivery of our orders and checks.  But he tried his best:)  Everyone raved about the quality of the happy hour food orders.  The quesadillas had the perfect amount of cheese.    I would definitely recommend checking out this happy hour before summer ends!"}
{"text":"They have the best guacamole & ceviche, I like their food because you can taste the flavors, and just to be honest I like their ceviche because I can order it with no onions which makes it best of the best lol"}
{"text":"The name had us at Tacos...and they did not disappoint! Our server Evan did an excellent job explaining the menu and options, as we had a tough time choosing between all the great entree choices. I ordered the bbq pork, Baja chicken, and carne asada tacos, and my sister ordered the carne asada, carnitas, and grilled avocado tacos. Seriously, each one was better than the next! Sis had the street corn side while I had black beans. Again...we both really enjoyed what we ordered. Having a choice of outdoor or indoor seating was nice , and we only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table outside.  This place is also dog-friendly outdoors.  Overall, for two travelers from Chicago who were excited to escape the cold spring we are having, this was a great choice, perfect location at the Biltmore shopping mall, easy walk from the Camby Hotel, and gave us that southwest taste and feel we were craving!! We will come back!!"}
{"text":"I've driven by here many times and it's always so busy, I finally had the chance to stop in. It's a Friday and we needed some Lenten options so Fish tacos and Blackened Mahi salad was perfect! Chips and salsa to start and a Mexican cheese quesadilla with guacamole got us started. Both were good. I had the tacos and every bite was delish, however they could have put a little more Yellow fin tuna in there. The wife's salad had a wonderfully seasoned and generous portion of Mahi. Delish! She also had the Blood Orange Italian margarita and said it was fab.   Looking forward to coming back for some of the other menu items. Cool atmosphere and service was just ok."}
{"text":"Went here with my family and we we had great service for our party of 7. The call-ahead option was perfect and our table was ready as soon as we had all arrived. The patio was a great place to wait for our table and we enjoyed some drinks. The margarita was a little weak but otherwise tasty.  We had the corn appetizer which was quite nice (but small - order 1 for every 2-3 people). Guacamole was okay - flavorful but had numerous large chunks of avocado in it, which is a no-no for me and makes dipping challenging. We also tried a cheese crisp that was basically an open-face quesadilla and was okay. Chips and salsa were solid.  I tried the mushroom tacos and fish tacos. Both were good but nothing special. Fish could use a bit of a tastier marinade perhaps. Overall, everything was quite fresh and everyone enjoyed their meal. This isn't the most authentic Mexican food, but it's well-presented using quality ingredients, so it's a solid choice over most places. I'd definitely recommend it for groups as well."}
{"text":"Amazing service tonight. I had a little issue with my dish, nothing major. But the chef literally came to the table, shook our hands, apologized and then insisted we had a flan on him. Which might I add is AMAZING. Between our outstanding server Matthew and Chef Alex I was very impressed with Blanco and will definitely be back again soon. Get the flan you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"In sum, YUM! We showed up for lunch as a party of four plus a baby completely starving after leaving another restaurant for slow service. We were seated immediately, and our friendly server was there within minutes to introduce us to the menu and take our drinks orders. We ordered a few appetizers and standard entrees - all was delicious and filling. My favorites were the queso and the street corn. Great all around service and food. The open air patio leading into the main dining area was a nice touch as well."}
{"text":"OMG!!! My friend brought me here for my first time and I loved the place and atmosphere. Our server was Maddy. She was so sweet and was on top of it when it came to our service. She was always smiling and she gave me a great recommendation for the green enchiladas. They were AWESOME!!!! Also with out asking she brought me a drink to go. It's the great customer service she provided where I'll be back to see her again!!! Thanks Maddy!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times with friends and the food is fantastic!  We are totally convinced that Blanco's is the place where FOX servers come to train because we have had HORRIBLE service EVERY single time! So, if you have low expectations of customer service, then this is the place for you! The tacos are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I was a little worried because it was so big and so loud, but once you're seated and your server quickly appears as your table and then just as quickly delivers two perfect margaritas, all fears diminish.   The vibe here is definitely boisterous--lots of groups and the music is notched up. But the space is laid out well, with two levels of dining room and a combination of tables and high tops. The effect is such that you feel like you're in a happening place, but you can also have a conversation with your tablemates.   We kept is simple; chips with guacamole--perfect--and we each had a taco selection. This is fun, because you get to choose the tacos that you want. We ended up with six different kinds: carnitas, shrimp, bbq chicken, beef, veg. All were delicious. They are small--so if you're really hungry, you might be a little disappointed on the size. But each one is perfectly prepared and really tasty."}
{"text":"Found Blanco Taco after wandering around Biltmore mall today. Their food defines excellence, as does their service.  Everything is made from scratch in their kitchen and tastes like it. The obligatory chips and salsa: perfect, both salsas are absolutely sparkling with flavors and so hard to stop eating with the perfectly made chips.  I had the green Chile pork burrito with a green enchildo sauce. So yummy and soooo filling! The roasted corn side: Utterly Amazing, you'll never order beans again, the sweet corn layered with the flavors of citrus, green onions and cilantro; I could have eaten a big bowl of just that!  You can't go wrong here. Eat. Repeat. Eat again, enjoy!"}
{"text":"This was the first place I \"landed\" after getting off the airplane. Food was very tasty and the service was quick and friendly. I was quite happy with my barbecue tacos."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I dream of the Warm Queso Blanco from this place! The food was so yummy and the service was good. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We held a co-worker's going away party here and I have to say that for a group of 16 people and one child-they did really well at serving us. The guac was good and I really liked their \"hot\" salsa that you have to ask for. The sangria is overly sweet but the house margarita on the rocks was better. The meals were so-so. I had some tired chicken enchilada's, but they werent horrendous, just pretty boring. My favorite thing about the whole night was hitting up the Trader Joe's in the same complex after dinner!"}
{"text":"So atmosphere was decent and guacamole was tasty. However not a large portion for $9.  We got tacos. The shrimp was ok but it said crispy (not really), liked the short rib but the fish one was gross and award winning bbq pork was just ok.   The crab and shrimp ceviche was the most disappointing though. It looked so fresh. However tasting the crab; something seemed off. When we asked the waitress she said \"oh yeah it's imitation crab\". Wtf so disgusting.  The only thing going for this place for us were the chips,  salsa and decent guacamole. Otherwise nothing great.  Really quite disappointed. Especially after an amazing experience at another taco place the night before (joyride tacos in Gilbert)."}
{"text":"We were lucky enough to get a reservation during restaurant week! Excellent!  Thanks Blanco!"}
{"text":"One bite of the carnitas taco...I thought I died and went to taco heaven! Absolutely freaking DELICIOUS!!! The simple salad was also divine!  I brought home another carnitas taco for myself, a steak and chicken for my husband and the green chili queso for him too. My husband balked at reheated tacos and did a full on snort at the idea of a chicken taco (silly man doesn't eat pork). It took him 2 days to try the tacos. He loved everything! Even the chicken one!  It's Friday night, we live in SE Gilbert....guess where he wants to go for dinner tonight.  That's right...Blancos Tacos!  Tonight we will be driving approx 30 miles for a taco. A. TACO!  It's that good!  You REALLY need to open one in the Gilbert Heritage District. REALLY!!"}
{"text":"Very poor quality food and drink . . . There at happy hour, and glasses tasted like soap. Don't order a White Sangria, as it is made with 80% sweet and sour mix from their margarita machine. Really disappointing.  The Quesadillas saved the day. They have a lot of cheese and a pleasant taste. But the Carnitas taco was the worst I've had -- just nasty. And the chips were greasy and right out of the fryer.   Very surprised. Sam Fox ought to do better. This was a relatively low-cost startup from Fox Restaurant Concepts in a location that has had other belly-up operations. This one is headed same direction, unfortunately. Love his \"Wild Child\" right up the street, however."}
{"text":"Nick was our server for lunch today and was absolutely amazing. The food was perfect too. One of my new favorite spots. Definitely save room for dessert, the Mexican chocolate cake is bomb."}
{"text":"Blanco has such a great atmosphere! The tacos were great! Pulled pork and chipotle shrimp!! Queso and salsa are a must and make sure to order a marg! I had the blood orange. It was just a little to limey for  me! But great dinner and a lot of fun!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch while shopping.  It was about 1:30 so the lunch crowd was winding down. Our server Ty was all smiles, but slow.  He took our order but didn't write it down, and as I suspected, the order was wrong.    He said sorry, I will talk to the chef.  We were pressed for time, and I hate sending stuff back. We ate and waited and waited and waited for the check.    Finally, after watching Ty walk all over the restaurant, we got our bill, paid & left.    Won't be back..."}
{"text":"Giving 4 stars because i didn't try the food. I Came here to have a drink and snack with a friend.. The guacamole and salsa and chip were good. Just like anyplace else but not sub par or anything. For my cocktail i had a red berry margarita that had its enough alcohol in it. The bartender told me it would be sweet but it really wasn't lol.."}
{"text":"You know when you really excited to go on that new ride at the amusement park beacuse it is all flash and new tech stuff, but when you get there, practically wetting your pants because you're next to go on the ride,  and then the attendant tells you that they have to close the ride for the day because one of the bolts got loose and the cart went careening off the track at 60 miles an hour and there are \"technical difficulties\" with the ride equipment, aka somebody's got killed until dead?  This place can be succinctly summed up by that quick anecdote.  Now for the review and something completely different:  Nice casual, relaxing setting. However, the food is not that great. Ordered the Machaca tacos.  They were alright but they were definitely nothing special.  The guacamole was way overpriced for the quality, $9 for something that should be worth $5 at the most. Overall it is a fun setting, but it is not a place if you are serious about eating.  Cheers, Until then, get the beers in..."}
{"text":"If you are coming here and going inside to sit down and do a whole lunch dinner thing... you're doing it wrong here.  Inside is \"fine\" as far as Mexican restaurants go; it's just way overpriced.   You get food that is \"Oh, okay. Cool\" at \"This is outstanding!\" prices.  Portions are the only equalizer here.  The thing about this spot is the walk up window (check the hours!) The food is much more affordable, reasonable portions, and still fresh and well seasoned Mexican fare. I will regularly come to the Biltmore to grab some $3 Nachos, a Shrimp Po'Boy; sit by the fountain, do some shopping and enjoy the outdoor patio.  DO try Blanco...just do it properly."}
{"text":"Blanco has been one of my favorite Mexican inspired restaurants for as long as I can remember. I am absolutely obsessed with their queso and guacamole! You can't beat their happy hour either- most of their margaritas are on special and the starter trio of guacamole/queso/salsa is only $3!!! A note: this location also has my favorite tequila, Casamigos, on tap! Yum! Anywhoooo- this review is specifically about my lunch visit today. Two of us were promptly sat on the patio to enjoy the nice weather, and had the absolute pleasure of being served by Sergio! My guest loves their spicy salsa (doesn't usually come when they set down chips and salsa to start you off) and right after Sergio brought us our drinks, without even having to ask he brought out their mild green salsa AND the spicy habanero one for us to \"try out\" and enjoy! I was blown away simply because it was an extra gesture to go out of the way for our meal, and out of all the times I have dined at Blanco (about 700 times lol) no one has ever done this. After filling up on some chips, we decided we weren't super hungry, but each wanted to order about two tacos. Sergio told us this was possible because we were able to order ala carte, which again, no one had ever let me know before! (I've always just ordered the taco plates with three of the same tacos on it) I wanted flour tortillas- the other person I was dining with wanted corn. Sergio said it was no problem to do that! COOL. We both also got two sides along with our taco plates which was awesome that we didn't have to share only one order of their yummy rice! :) Overall this was the best service I have ever had at Blanco, out of either location I have been to (the Borgata/the Biltmore) and I am so appreciative of Sergio, his awesome attitude and his timely catering to us to make our experience so wonderful. The next time I come in (probably in a few days- I can't get enough) I will be asking for Sergio to take care of me again. ¬°Muchas Gracias, Sergio! :)"}
{"text":"Average food, which is strange for a fox restaurant. The service was just BAD!!! I had a margarita and after it was finished I put it at the end of the table as kind of a hint to ask if I wanted another, no go! After 6 pass by's from our waiter I walked to the bar to get it myself. My wife just had water and no offers to refill. After all that I talked to the manager and all I got was a \"that's not right\" then the bill came and no compensation. Can you say One and done?"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their carnitas tacos and simple salad! Their rice is so creamy it almost tastes like risotto. I've been with friends who didn't love their food as much as we do, but I rarely stray from my known favorites because I love them so much here. My husband likes the Carne asada tacos too. Now they need to open one in the SE Valley so we can eat here more often!!"}
{"text":"Walking in to Blanco Taco I was craving some good mexican food. Upon sitting down we were greeted with a smile and some yummy chips and salsa. (They should really bag that stuff up and sell it- THAT good.) Our server was cheerful and offered us some margaritas and explained the menu a bit... turns out they had just revamped it a few days before. We were excited to be guinea pigs and I ordered the 'new' camarones tacos and my boyfriend ordered the pork enchiladas along with a couple of classic margaritas.   To begin with... the margaritas were awesome. And then comes the food... delicious! The three street tacos were plenty and the rice that comes with is awesome. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his enchiladas and liked the fact that they were made in layers to ensure a little bit of everything in each bite.   Although we were stuffed our server tempted us to try the flan... and I'm glad they did... it was yummmy! Overall a fantastic experience. Without hesitation, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Our daughter got married on 1/20/18, and she and her husband love this restaurant and chose this as their reception dinner venue.  The food was excellent.  The wait staff, Raymond, Emerald, and Joshua were professional, friendly, and efficient.   My husband and I were very pleased, with the private room in the basement.   The bartender did a wonderful job keeping up with the orders.  The d√©cor was festive and intimate with all the candles.  They allowed us to bring in our own flowers, and decorations for the table, very nice.   The slicing charge for us bringing in our own cake was the same as every where else."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!  Our table of 3 sampled and shared.  Nachos outstanding!  And my favorite... the BBQ Pulled Pork tacos - DELICIOUS!  Service was outstanding too - exactly what you expect at a Fox restaurant!!  Excellent service from Brandon!"}
{"text":"Heaven on a plate . . .  I dine at Blanco regularly, and it is hands-down the best . . . best. Surely someone will screech that the food isn't Mexican enough, and I don't know about all that, but I do know it is delicioso! And they have everything, really. They have ample seating inside, outside, at a bar, and they even have a order/take-out window just next door with options for people who just want to dine and dash . . . after paying.  I tend to order a hibiscus green tea with a carne asada burrito (enchiliada-style, Christmas-style sauce), rice, and black beans. Everything on the menu is good, though. My buddy loves their mole (if you're envisioning a furry animal, let Google handle this one). Ask for the habanero sauce with your chips!"}
{"text":"I met with my dinner group there tonight.  It was selected by a gal who frequents it. There were 5 in our group. We started with the delicious blood orange margarita's that the server recommended and they were delicious. We enjoyed chips, salsa, and the fresh guacamole as the appetizer. I ordered the short rib tacos, and others ordered enchiladas, fish tacos, and grilled fish. The sides were beans and rice.  Our service was outstanding with refills given frequently. The atmosphere was modern and comfortable. I would definitely go again and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"We visited Blanco Scottsdale for the first time and came away impressed.  Blanco's is one of the Fox Restaurant Group places, and it is a nice concept in upscale gourmet Mexican food. http://www.foxrc.com/  The Chicken Fajitas were flavorful at $15.00, as were the Machaca Tacos for $12.00 and BBQ Pork Tacos for $11.00 (See photos). The Ground Beef Nachos ($12.00, plus $6.00 for a side of Guacamole) went pretty quickly.   Our lunch bill for a party of four came to $68.53 before tip and everything was very good, though admittedly some of the portions were small."}
{"text":"This was my second time to Blanco. First time was a year or so ago and to be honest I kind of forgot about it. Reunited with blanco when I found them on Yelp. Went there on a Sunday afternoon, they had great service and a very lively feeling. Our waiter was one of the best I've had in scottsdale/phx and I would definitely recommend the shrimp/carna/fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere but my friends and I were a bit disappointed with the food.  Before I complain though, I will say that the chips and guacamole were excellent.  Their chips are the thick, greasy kind that always tastes so good.  The guacamole \"Blanco style\" has cojita cheese in it and really was delicious!    I had the Blanco Chopped Salad (achiote chicken, seasonal fruits, and pepitas) and found it pretty bland and boring.  (The achiote chicken salad at zTejas is much better.)  Others at the table had the cheese crisp with chicken and the green chile pork enchilada with chicken.  The cheese crisp was huge but nothing too exciting -- all the cheese and chicken seemed to be crammed into the middle, so the end pieces were mostly plain tortilla.  The enchilada with chicken was kinda weird -- it had this weird chewy pulled chicken.  We honestly couldn't even figure out if it was chicken or pork.    The service was okay but it seemed like we constantly needed more water.  The glasses were too small and were filled with ice.  I'd probably come back here just for some chips, guac, and a drink."}
{"text":"While visiting from out of town, I found this nice little restaurant very close to our resort. Gabby was our sever and she did a great job offering suggestions for a nice combination of tacos for each of us. There was a DJ and the place was reasonably busy for an early Saturday night. A great option for casual dining at a very good value. I would recommend the Slow cooked BBQ pork and the Baja Chicken tacos. They'll mix and match your order of 3 tacos and serve them with beans and rice."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Blanco for a quick dinner after a movie at AMC Esplanade. The food was good and our main bartender took very good care of us. However, the second bartender on staff was slow to help us. She delivered us a dirty plate and after we brought it to her attention, she failed to get us new plates. In the mean time, she unloaded the bar dishwasher and cleaned several glasses. While she was doing this, we had to ask our main bartender to get us clean plates all the while our food was getting cold. I certainly understand there are a number of items which need to be done while bartending, but the customer should be the priority."}
{"text":"Chose to go here because it looked rather enticing while waiting for my Apple Store appointment and I'd seen the location in Scottsdale.  Although the service was great, the tacos awesome...the Salsa was brutal.  The chips were legit The mild stuff seemed like it was the tostitos store bought non-sense and the hot stuff they brought me which I was told had Habaneros in it tasted citrusy, perhaps a lime...but nothing else.  And for that you tank as a Mexican Resto."}
{"text":"This Blanco is different from the one in the Biltmore in that it has a woodfired oven after having taken over the space from what the father in law stated was a steakhouse.  The service was also much more earnest here, we came by for my paramour's birthday lunch, you know that kind of day where it's her day and her parents were back in town for a spell.  We started the day training and then hit Blanco.  I went for Shrimp and Mahi tacos.  I had no issues with the food in the Biltmore location but the service was just extremely slow.  This was apparently our server's last day as he was moving on, he was excited for his new gig.  Very earnest fellow who treated us kindly.  I'm more into the ambiance and center bar of this location.  The Tequila selection was mad...if only it had been a heavy drinking day."}
{"text":"The food is not very good here.  You can get much better Mexican food (if you can even call it that) in the Phoenix area.  The price is a bit high for what you get, but it still isn't very expensive.  Our waiter was was good, but the food took forever to arrive.  The place was worth a try, but we would not return."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and wanted Mexican. We saw Blanco was listed very high on Trip Advisor. It was delicious!!! Our waiter was great, offered an explanation of the menu, offered a hotter salsa and offered us water and Pepsi to go. Will definitely try Blanco again!"}
{"text":"Two words - happy hour.   Half-priced margaritas make even the most mediocre Mexican food amazing, and thankfully Blanco's food was very good to begin with. Thanks for a snafu in the kitchen I was able to try both the chicken and vegetarian nachos and found both to be some of a best I have had. The carnitas tacos and chicken burrito are nothing to sneeze at either. My girlfriend had the taco salad and is currently trying to emulate it at home.  The wait staff was also great - water and margarita refills were speedy, and overall level of attentiveness was just right.  Overall - I recommend Blanco. Whether you make happy hour or not, the food and drinks are great, the prices are reasonable, and - unlikely too many other Scottsdale places - it doesn't take itself too seriously."}
{"text":"Always delicious and good service! Very friendly bartender. Had the street tacos and enchilada which were yummy! Ask for the different kinds of salsa!!"}
{"text":"I'm SO freaking bummed this place isn't in LA.  We were in Scottsdale for my fianc√©'s conference and needed some food the night before we left. After much debate and not a lot of help from Yelp's \"nearby\", we decided to grab whatever was closest to a Starbucks we went to get coffee at. This turned out to be Blanco.   SADLY (I'M SO BUMMED) we had our Shiba pup with us and couldn't leave him alone in the hotel room-think apocalypse except with more teeth marks-so we had to order to-go which meant... no margaritas... no margaritas....... :( I even tried to DoorDash it since they sometimes Dash alcohol! No luck.  We were starving so we ordered over the phone: one carne asada burrito enchilada style, one green chile pork enchilada, one red chile chicken cheese crisp, and an order of their street corn.  Upon entering, the hostesses were friendly and directed me to the bar to pay and pick-up my order. I was honestly super lost because the bar was in the center of the restaurant, near where the food was coming out, and it looked like everyone there was busy making drinks and not organizing take out. I kept looking around and looking around like an idiot and finally a guy (maybe the manager?) asked if I needed help. YES PLEASE. He helped me get my bill paid for.  The two of us split everything and it was a ton of food. The street corn was soooo good, and I'm totally making it at home now.  The cheese crisp is basically a pizza on a tortilla. It had cilantro, onion, tomatoes, poblano, and shredded red chile chicken. No complaints here except it was a little cold by the time we got back to our room.  The enchilada came with a side of rice and beans (charro), and the beans may be the most delicious pinto beans I've ever had. They taste slightly meaty which was amazing mixed into the rice. The pork in the enchilada was super tender and slightly fatty, definitely a nice roasted pork shoulder.   The burrito was pretty darn good too. The carne asada was hearty, was in fairly big pieces, and tasted like really fresh, quality meat. A lot of Mexican places nearby chop up the asada so small it falls out all over the place and is over-seasoned with lime. This asada was on point.  The order also came with super crispy chips and salsa!   Gosh I'm so bummed, I'm in love with this place already and I haven't even had a margarita... Oh and the dog loved the beans and rice too."}
{"text":"Wow! That is what comes to mind recalling our perfect service and food last night. Our server Val couldn't have done anything more to make our evening more perfect. Two of us had taken a friend out and after Val checked with us twice we explained the reason we were there and we would probably be there awhile. He was understanding and seemed to sense when to approach us to see if all was well, and when not to. Two of us have been there previously and always have had great service and food, but last night he went above and beyond. Thank you Val and the restaurant manager."}
{"text":"I love Blanco Tacos and Tequila in Scottsdale for their fresh ingredient menu as well as the outside firepits and patio! Now that there is a Blanco at Biltmore,  I was anxious to see how this location fared against the Scottsdale one. I was not let down.  My best friend., Jeran and I decided Blanco was perfect during some impulsive shopping in Biltmore Fashion Park and we noticed, NOT only was it Taco Tuesday, BUT, it was happy hour!! Double win! We started with freshly made margaritas and the Blanco's Famous freshly made guacamole off the half off happy hour menu. HALF OFF!!! You can't go wrong with a margarita, guac, and gossip on a hot summer day in the desert!   I am blown away by the quantity of tequila choices at Blanco. From blanco to anejo to reposado to ultra tequilas, and even a couple of mezcals for the super brave! There are more than fifty plus types of tequila to line up with your salt and lime. Impressive! I had not ever paid attention to all the variety before and it's important for any place highlighting 'tequila' in it's title. If it were a weekend night , this would be one place to begin , or end the fun. Because we all know what tequila does !? Our waiter was very helpful in suggesting what tequila to match our tastes and for our choice of margaritas.The margaritas on the menu are 'built' with a certain tequila, but you are able to change them up, if you would like. Good to know!  He also kept us hydrated with never allowing our h2o to go beyond half empty ... Or half full? I opted for the White Peach and Hibiscus margarita and my buddy stuck with his usual , the  Classic marg. Yum with a caramba! Thank Jose we had more shopping at Biltmore to do, as that libation went down way too fast and too smoothly...   As far as food, I had the Seafood Salad. Full of fresh veggies and jicama;   I added grilled shrimp to it, as well. Not heavy on the dressing, and it honestly didn't need it with as loaded and tasty as the salad was. Perfect!  Jeran had a Carne Asada Burrito, which I swear he was so picky in ordering, I can't remember what he ended up with, (or maybe that was the tequila again?) ; But when it arrived, he was happy!   The waiter, again, never missed a beat and we both walked away with NO tacos on Tuesday , ( I think it's original  reason we wanted Blanco on this day??!) again... Tequila ! But we did walk away to shop tipsy ...full and happy! Yay! Hasta luego Blanco .. Until we meet again! Maybe for that Taco Tuesday??"}
{"text":"The best deal on the menu is $6 for their chicken tortilla soup. Otherwise, it's $9+ for cheese crisps and $12 for three small tacos. Went with a party, the waitress said they couldn't split the ticket, which had to be discussed with the manager before it could happen. It took 10 minutes to get a drink and for two bowls of soup, we were the last served at the table and the soup was lukewarm. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good space here.  Love the fact that the outdoor patio had little heat lamps...ya know, for the frigid 50s that Phoenix hits on winter nights (sense of midwestern, we just got another frickin' foot of snow last night. sarcasm here!!).  Great patio lounging area, and the inside (where we chose to dine) is wide-open and airy.  I think I ate three whole avocados here the night I had dinner.  First, the guacamole, which was delish (and the chips were stellar enough for me to break my carb-free diet for a few!)  Then my ceviche (shrimp and crab), which was more of a slaw than a ceviche, but very good nonetheless...avocado in there.  Then my salad with goat cheese, pistachios, and yes, more avocado.  (Told ya, I ate three avocados!)  Service was friendly.  I dig the striped shirts they ahd going on there, however, as my ever-so-smart pal pointed out, \"They would never last in Chicago\" (ya know, the whole we hate striped shirts, and \"we're annoyed by former frat boys named Chad\" deal we have going on here.)  Not bad...perhaps I should've tried a margarita!  Oh, and basked in the glow of the heat lamp in a comfy chair on the patio.  Perhaps another day."}
{"text":"Blood orange marg, charred street corn, and street tacos for happy hour!? This place is the best. I love sitting on the patio sipping margaritas, they have a good selection of tequila, and I love that they have a good parking lot."}
{"text":"This restaurant had outstanding food. Most of the food was more of a street Mexican style but all of it was delicious. My only small problem was the service. Our server wasn't very present during our meal. Other than the small issue I would definitely suggest Blanco Tacos + Tequila."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch at this venue of Blanco's yesterday, as we had a good experience at their Sky Harbor airport venue.  We ordered the green chili pork enchilada and a trio of tacos:  crispy shrimp,  fish and carne asada.  We started with an appetizer of of street corn.  All complemented by their classic margarita. The chips and salsa that comes to the table when seated were really quite good, and the margaritas and street corn were excellent.  Of the main dishes, only the crispy shrimp was excellent.  The carne asada was OK, but the fish was very fishy and unpleasant.  Their pork enchilada was a layered version in a pan, and it was tasty, but not particularly outstanding."}
{"text":"Like blanco but in the run. Get some queso to fuel the shopping fire."}
{"text":"I come in blanco all the time we love Raymond he is one of the best servers we have ever come across... the food is also fantastic.."}
{"text":"Stop on by for some late night chips and guacamole but could not find parking anywhere. We had to park by Walgreens which really isn't an issue. Just a nuisance. The guacamole was amazing, the queso was fantastic too.  I had the Green Chile Pork bowl which was great but the pork was super bland. Also, did not come with half of the ingredients the menu stated. So it was kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"Great service up at the bar! Sips of margarita extras? Yes, please! I tried the rojo sangria, the white peach and hibiscus margarita, oaxacan shandy...all delicious. The extra beer that came with the shandy was perfect. Happy hour at Blanco will be happening much more often!"}
{"text":"The chips and salsa were pretty good for starters but I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and one chicken. The rice was overly salty and tasted processed. Blended lime margarita was like a slushy without tequila, (maybe they forget it) There was nothing special about their food and I don't recommend for you to come here. The prices did not fit the quality!"}
{"text":"Watch out for the margaritas they are awesome and two, we'll get √ºber. I had the beef burrito and the favors tied to the avocado dip are AWESOME. thanks for a very tasteful experience"}
{"text":"Mexican chopped salad w/grilled Chicken = yummmm! I love roasted corn so maybe a little bias ;) but mix of everything was pretty good! Only 2 things I would change if I could: 1) make the tortilla strips shorter - I felt that they were having a fight with my mouth & face lol 2) I'll more than likely ask for jalape√±os next time. Needs a bit more of that kick/salty taste.  Overall tho, I'll definitely be back! Super clean, friendly staff including bartender. Outside patio is somewhat small but still great to be sitting at. They have misters so helps keep the inside cool air flowing."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been looking for a some good Mexican/TexMex food since we moved to Phoenix. Finally found a good place!!  The shopping area this place is in is very nice.  Valet parking for $7 which I found to be reasonable. The hostesses were very friendly when we walked up and welcomed us. We were seated right away. The waiter was amazing the whole time.  He first showed us the happy hour menu and the good deals they had during Happy Hour. I went with the house margarita on the rocks and my wife had the mixed berry margarita on the rocks for $5 each.  I really liked the house margarita because they use fresh lime juice and no mixes. My wife loved her margarita. We also tried the dip plate for $3 during Happy Hour. It was beans, guacamole and queso. It was a nice starter.  Not the best queso I've had but better than all the other places I've tried so far in Phoenix. We didn't know and I guess the waiter wasn't paying attention to the time. Happy hour had already ended when we ordered. He said it was his fault and those drinks and appetizer were for the happy hour price.  That was very nice of him. I went on to order the Carna Asada burrito with jalape√±os and my wife got three street tacos, Carnitas, bbq Pork and chipotle shrimp. Her favorite was the chipotle shrimp. She subbed rice for street corn and thought it was good too. I got the black beens and rice.  Loved the rice. The beans were ok. They didn't skimp on the jalape√±os. My burrito was loaded with jalape√±os and steak. Tasted great and spicy! I also tried the jalape√±o infused tequila margarita.  One of the  Best spicy margarita I've had. For being upscale the prices were responsible. Our total was $85 for 3 rounds of margaritas, the app and our dinners. The bathrooms are down stairs. The do have an elevator if needed. The bathroom was modern and very clean. We will be back for sure. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came for dinner at 5:00 and caught the last hour of happy hour.  Great drinks and apps available for very reasonable prices.  Our server was upbeat, friendly and attentive.  The garage doors were open and I love bringing the outside air in.  Music was playing and the atmosphere was lively.  We enjoyed the trip of dips, salad and tacos.  We didn't like the tortas as much though.  Great for kids too.  Will return!"}
{"text":"This place has some great curb appeal... Being a Mexican resturant you would think the drinks would be outstanding it's just the opposite a sugar pre made mess.. Mango jalape√±o I can't even explain it.. Didn't even taste like either and the garnish was a lime... Should have been a jalape√±o  The waitress was amazing super nice And kept checking on us which made the experience better knowing they know how to pick the staff  this just need to be filtered into the kitchen and bar The food was ok just seemed pre packed frozen food :("}
{"text":"A date raved about this place and took me here and I wasn't impressed.  We went for happy hour and there really didn't seem like there were any specials.  I ordered 3 different street tacos, and they were alright, nothing earth-shattering.  Portion size was VERY small, and maybe that is due to it being happy hour.  The price seemed really high given the portion size.  It was like a snack and I expected a bit more even though it was happy hour.  I had to fill up on the dips with chips item on the menu.  With so many places around that serve traditional and fusion street tacos, why bother coming back?"}
{"text":"It was taco Tuesday and very busy.. Despite the crowds the service was impeccable and the food came out much faster than I expected. We shared the ceviche, must say I wanted to order another instead of tacos! However I was glad I ordered tacos as well... I had the fish, he had the chicken. Both were highly satisfying! Very flavorful and I was impressed with the flour tortilla. Their rice, unlike any I had ever eaten. Super buttery and full of flavor, drooling just reminiscing over the meal. . . At the end we each (unexpectedly) were handed a Klondike Choco Taco!! Perfect way to end a meal 5 stars. I plan to return VERY soon.   PS we were pressed for time, I'd like to stay longer and enjoy more options."}
{"text":"Such a great hangout and such a great place for Mexican food! I went for lunch with a group of 6 from a business meeting. We were your typical annoying larger group--we wanted separate checks. Our server, Raymond, was such a champ with us, and I want to give him major props for dealing with our separate checks and different needs while making us still feel completely welcome. He's everything a good server should be!"}
{"text":"I stayed at a hotel near by blanco tacos and passed by it everyday for two weeks.   I decided to go by and check it out since it almost always had a decent sized crowd.   The location is perfect,  with it being with in walking distance to the hotel I was staying st right in Scottsdale Rd.   Great place for happy hour and to watch a game.   I came by a few times and caught some games,  had a few beers and appetizers.   The bartenders are supper cool!  One even gave me a beer on the house since it was my first time.   The people in the area are supper friendly,   The waitresses are pretty and nice,   And the little appetizer that I had was decent.    The happy hour prices are very reasonable and affordable."}
{"text":"The entire staff is friendly and courteous.  Food has it all...flavor, uniqueness and great presentation.  Drinks are made to perfection every time.  Whatever you do, do not pass on the rice, trust me.  Great comfortable patio areas.  I will become a regular for sure.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Way disappointed!  Food was garden variety mexican.  Our waitress was not interested.  And my biggest pet peeve of leaving the table full of dirty dishes while we were left sitting there trying to pay our bill topped off a forgetful evening in Scottsdale.  Go somewhere / anywhere else for a better expenditure of your time and money."}
{"text":"I went to Blanco for drinks with my husband and a friend.  My blood orange margarita was spot on... YUM!  We also had two desserts: donuts and sundae.  They were both very good and I recommend getting both together because then you can dip the donuts into the ice cream.  I was only here on vacation otherwise I would stop in frequently for drinks!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!! My husband and I sat at the bar to order food and drinks, the bartender walked away after our initial order for two mimosas and menus.  They were out of champagne and I guess menus since he did not ask us if we wanted anything else.  We decided to sit at the community table because of his lack of interest in waiting on us.  When we sat down at the  community table there was a tip next to where we were sitting, a different server picked it up but never acknowledged us.  Then she walked by us 5 times before I finally asked for a menu which she threw on the table!! Wow, the people must really hate working there, the worst service ever!  We decided to leave, who needs that kind of abuse."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. The taco choices sounded amazing, but I decided to get the queso blanco nachos with the braised short rib machaca, and they were the best nachos I've had ever! The house margarita was also delicious, and the service was great. I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Phoenix so I can try more things on the menu."}
{"text":"This place has a lot going for it in terms of atmosphere and the food is like other Sam Fox restaurants: consistent and pretty good. This is not an amazing dining experience and the food isn't anything special, but it's a relaxing restaurant. The service is pretty bad. Super young wait staff that look good but are slow and sometimes rude.   I've eaten here 4-6 times and I always get the guacamole to start and the kobe beef burrito. The burrito is huge and I always have leftovers. One great thing about Blanco is the rice -- it's an odd side since it's pretty buttery but I think it's yummy.   The chips and salsa are standard and I've often had stale chips. Also, the Pepsi is usually flat.  In sum: the food is pretty good and the atmosphere makes this place an appealing restaurant to return to, however the sub-standard service hit-or-miss drinks/chips can taint an otherwise good experience.  Go here and try it -- just know it's a gamble."}
{"text":"I thought I could select from the menu. But I was do wrong the food was amazing. And being intrigued by their slow cook pork and their house guacamole. It was phenomenal. I felt I was in the \"ratatouille\" movie. Will recommend to all my friends."}
{"text":"Okay, I have revamp my review. My wife and I have been back a couple of times. The food was awesome, just awesome. Even though it still seems a little light on volume of food for the price, it is super tasty. You should try it. I gave it a second (and 3rd chance) and was happy that I did."}
{"text":"My family have made this a biweekly event. The atmosphere is nice, quiet and yet still lively enough to justify the type of restaurant. The happy hour is so so for food, it's a better deal to get the regular entree at least that way you get rice and beans. Margaritas are pretty good and they are not overly salted.  One thing I would say is they could add more of their margaritas to the happy hour list."}
{"text":"I think I became a bigger fan of this place after trying their shrimp and crab ceviche. Simply amazing!!!! I could order bowls of this stuff (something I think I do during their happy hour since its half off) and be content with that. Their shortrib cheese crisp with avocados was equally as delish. Great flavor to the short ribs. Had their guacamole and it was wonderful again, seems to be pretty consistent. Same thing with their white peach hibiscus margarita. I could literally drink 10 of these things which will get me into trouble at some point I am sure. Blanco has great food and fun atmosphere with a hip and trendy vibe. Even the hubby enjoyed the food even though this is not his type of place. Try it, you will be a fan too   :)"}
{"text":"Hi We tried to eat dinner there 3/3, first we were told by the hostess there was an hour wait.  Then we were informed it would be an hour and a half.  The hostesses are very unfriendly, and actually make unkind faces while speaking to you.   We left and went elsewhere, where we were welcomed and treated very well.   The hostess is the first person that represents your restaurant.  She should be friendly and welcoming and not send the customers running away."}
{"text":"I would have loved to give Blanco 5 stars for the quality and taste of food, but there were some complications regarding the service that we received.   My friend stressed to the waiter that she has a bad dairy allergy. Originally, her entree would have consisted of three tacos, a plate of beans, and rice, but she asked for 1) tacos without dairy products; 2) black beans; and 3) no rice (because of butter) but extra beans.   There were several things wrong with how her food arrived. 1) Her tacos came with cream fresco that was hidden under the meat. She ate one, not knowing that it was hidden, and felt absolutely nauseous and was unable to eat anything else. 2) She asked for no rice, but her entree came with it anyway. 3) She ordered black beans but received another kind of beans (possibly pinto?). 4) She did not receive the extra beans she asked for. It was careless how they handled my friend's food, especially given her allergy. She was nice enough to refrain from pointing out the mistake regarding the buttered rice and the beans.  When we told the waiter about the cream fresco on the taco, he seemed unapologetic, and barely checked up on us throughout our meal. The waiter's response to the various mistakes associated with my friend's order was that he would make two more tacos for her, this time without sour cream. The two small tacos took such a long time to make that I finished my entire meal before she received hers. She asked for a to-go instead.   Update on the to-go order that was put in: Blanco put cheese and cream fresco on the tacos they sent her home with.   Honestly, it might have been just a bad day at Blanco, and I might consider checking it out again for the food, because the food itself was delicious. However, the service was so off-putting that we got out of the restaurant in a hurry, and it was even more disappointing that they would put dairy products in her to-go box.   Bottom line: A restaurant that does not care for the health concerns of their customers is not a restaurant that can be trusted."}
{"text":"It has taken a while for me to review on my experience but I will say over all it always has been a pleasure. My rating is mainly on service. I have only had chips and salsa along with drinks. My first time I ate my snack and drink was in the small dining area out side the little shop. The staff is friendly. This is actually my little stop for a quick drink. The infused flavored water is the best. Daily fresh fruit infused in the water is mighty tasty. I hope to be back soon to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say with this place. The atmosphere was nice. The waiter was awesome do I remember is name no. Just that he had long hair and nose ring and was the best waiter ever.  My chicken burrito was to die for.  The salad was out of my taste but when I tried it all I could say was holy cow this salad is great even tho I took a lot of the topping off, funny was the manager said would you like me to make u a new salad. I said. No it's fine . That was great that he saw that I was takeing the top stuff off, but Man U are the whole salad.  Pomegranate margarita awesome I had 2 of them.  Now will I be back here of course I will. When we come for my daughters family weekend for school. Hope to see the same waiter again. Only wish I knew his name. Ugh.   Until next time Arizona."}
{"text":"It is ok, but the fair is somewhat generic.  Martini was a letdown as compared to AZ88.  It is close and popular, but I would prefer other places most of the time.  It is because of the generic nature."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and fantastic tequila!  The setup with the tvs nice and high made my view an uninterrupted delight.  It gets packed so make reservations!"}
{"text":"Ok, I've been here a couple of times and to their other locations as well and it was just ok. Last week, I realized that it is highly dependent on what you order. The Biltmore location has a private room downstairs for parties. It's a good space - roomy and has a bar. We needed somewhere private with clients. First, the cocktails were excellent. I'm not a margarita drinker in general but this was so well done that I'd definitely drink two next time :). They used premium tequila and fresh lime juice - nothing artificial about it and not too sweet.  Then we had a round of appetizers for the table. They were wonderful generous portions of guacamole, ceviche, chips and salsa. I don't order ceviche often but will definitely go back for this. Frankly, the appetizers were so good that I could have stopped right there.  I got shrimp tacos for dinner. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and they served them on corn tortillas for me - always my preference.  I recognize that this was a private affair and our service was impeccable but I'll go back and check out the after-work margaritas with a side of guac."}
{"text":"Ok, this is a little premature from me, but I know that Brandon is waiting for this review. I made the mistake of mentioning Yelp when I sat down, so he was on top of his game. It reminded me of an episode of 3rd Rock from the Sun...  Anyway, I say this is premature because, although I have been to Blanco twice now, I have only had drinks and apps, and I don't feel I know enough to write a full review.  That being said, Brandon rocks. The Blood Orange marg that he suggested was tasty. A second one may have knocked me on my butt, but the alcohol was well hidden. I ordered the guacamole and is was creamy and chunky and delicious (also full of monounsaturated fats- hooray!). My friend ordered the Three Cheese Quesadilla with chicken. She liked that too.  I would like to go back for more margaritas and maybe an order of the fish tacos. And the flan.  Shout out to Brandon."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here a few times now. We really love it here. Tonight we had the street corn and the nachos and quesadilla. All amazing. Previously we have had the enchiladas also very good.  We don't drink but I have hear from friends that do that the mixed drinks are great.   The complementary chips are salsa are really fresh and tasty.   The atmosphere is casual. The place is huge and the best time to go is late afternoon. They don't accept reservations.   We will be back often."}
{"text":"This place is great, their margaritas really pack a punch. But you can soak up their amazing flavor with a great burrito, their ingredients are high quality and the service is amazingly good and friendly. The staff are friendly and attentive and are great at anticipating your needs. The only thing I would change is that they use white rice in their burritos, although delicious- it should really be the red tomato sauce rice other than that, this place is a solid 5 star Mexican food restaurant. Bonus: They have a take out window for smaller on-the-go meals."}
{"text":"We had a seven people in our party.  Thank-goodness we had a reservation.  The place was busy and after I visit, I ask why??  Being so close to Mexico, you would think the food would be more authentic.  The food and service are very poor.  The service was awful.  Our waitress did not want to be there and made it very obvious with the eye rolling when asked questions or asking for extra chips and refills of water.  We stopped asking for anything as she was worthless and should not be in a client facing role!  The food was bad chain food gone even worse with absolutely no QA on the food.  The fish tacos were terrible.  Instead of wheres the beef? this was where's the fish?  We could not find any on these tiny fish tacos.  Just terrible.  The salsa was closer to ketchup than salsa.  One of the worst salsas we have ever had.  The food looks pre cooked and thrown into a blast oven.  Not even close to fresh.  The fajitas were asked to have half/half steak and chicken but I asked three times to make sure the chicken is not over cooked as chicken breast will dry out immediately when it is not cooked properly.  Well, I was right and regretted it.  The chicken was as tough as leather and tasteless.  The steak was served and looked like dog food.  The presentation was non-existent.  The burritos lacked flavor and no spice at any level.  The tacos were terrible as again, no taste.  We should have just found a good taqueria as the price would have been better and the food would have been light years better.  Sooooooooo disappointed at this establishment.  Peoples taste buds have been blinded and people are taste blind who eat here.  Perhaps it's the booze that makes the food better for others.  However, for our group, nothing was even close to being on the mark."}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars if I could have heard the person next to me talk! Music needs to be turned down, just a notch. I understand the atmosphere, but c'mon, we were with a big group of girls and it was impossible to follow the conversation. Ok, moving on. Loved the food, loved the vibe, great, quick service. The chips-n-salsa were addictive. I was this close to ordering some to take home. Loved my meal, which were the fish tacos, perfect portion size. Not too much, not too little. Good time!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Select items half price!  Had the chicken nachos which were enough to share with 3 or 4 people.  We also order cheese crisp thing with guacamole a bit salty, but was still quite tasty.  The margaritas were sweet and refreshing which was key since it was 113 outside!    Service was could have been more attentive, but our server was friendly and the food came right out.    What I liked was the group table in the bar.  So much better than sitting at the bar because it allows you to sit across from someone you want to talk to and share food with.  The restaurant had a nice vibe to it too."}
{"text":"The fish tacos were good and the trendy atmosphere was nice. But, the whole thing was a bit too formula...like \"restaurant in a box\" concept. No outlyers, not much spice, fairly bland, middle of the road.....but wait, its in Arizona! Ok, no political jokes re Arizona. I was so-so with Blanco and will continue to explore on the next visit."}
{"text":"Thinking about attacking that taco craving? Look no further. I like mixing and matching from their 12 different selections. If you've dined at Fox Restaurant Concept establishments in the past, you know the Slow Cooked Bar-B-Q is a winner winner, shredded pork dinner. Go with a the charro beans (light, spiced, pinto beans).  The other day I tried the chicken mole and vegetable arroz. It was flat-out superb. The braised shredded chicken is served in a bowl mixed up with the rice and mole sauce with corn or flower tortillas on the side. If you happen to bring home leftovers, you'll be thanking yourself later. Speaking of which, ensure you have leftovers by starting with the guacamole and crispy salted chips. The guac has a faint kick to it, so be ready.   In the mood for enchiladas? You're going to get a cheesy delicious pie. The enchiladas are served up in a cast iron skillet, queso to the brim!  The decorum is trendy and cool. I really enjoy going here, though it can get pretty busy towards the evening. As with any FRC restaurant, you're going for the great tastes and ambiance, but not the price."}
{"text":"I took off a star because I think some of the menu items are overpriced and the place was REALLY loud. Turn the music down just a bit. Overall the decor lends a cool vibe and the service was excellent... Not too pushy, not too distant. We had three people and split two cheese crisps and an order of tacos and we had stuff to take home. The cocktails were also really good and not full of sweeteners. Mama like!"}
{"text":"Though the atmosphere is hip and service is friendly, the food isn't even subpar. It's just not good at all. I'm surprised it's a Fox restaurant as those are usually consistently great places. I've been to Blanco twice and tried different dishes, and both times were a major disappointment...won't be back again."}
{"text":"The restaurant was across from our resort so why not!! OH YES!! The service was GREAT and the food was AMAZING. The salsa was fresh and delicious. Another great appetizer is the Mexican Street Corn. I also substituted my rice with the corn as one of my sides with my tacos. BEST CHOICE EVER!! The grilled fish tacos were SUPERB. The atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed.  I hope to get back in town during the fall or winter when the fire pits are lit on the patio. It looked like a great spot to have a good time with friends."}
{"text":"Service at this place is outstanding I visit a lot of restaurant but is wow....way to go Blancos..."}
{"text":"First of all I love their food! Some of my favorite. But the service was HORRIBLE I called ahead and was told an hour wait. Get there half an hour later and told it's another hour. Ended up being an hour and a half. Waitress was rude. Also somehow so many parties say ahead of us even though we had waited the longest?"}
{"text":"Shrimp cheese crisp and sangria. My happy place. I'm here almost every time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Being a foodie transplant from California I obviously gravitated toward the FOX Restaurant Concepts group of restaurants.  I love the modern decor, innovative menus, and overall aesthetic qualities of their restaurants.  I unfortunately have to say that of the FOX Restaurants, Blanco is one of my least favorites.  I have to admit that their margaritas are amazing but I have been three times now and have always been disappointed in their salads and entrees.  I may be a little picky and love good Mexican food but I find that my food tends to be bland and definitely leaves something to be desired.  My friends and I now only go to Blanco for drinks after work and then decide on a different location for dinner.  If this is your plan then I definitely recommend heading over for some of the best margaritas in the valley."}
{"text":"I've been here more than enough times. I try something different on the menu every time I've gone and each time I was blown away. I was born and raised in a border town, spent most of my time in Mexico. Yes, the tacos here are not \"authentic\" but they are equally delicious. My favorite tacos were the carnitas, the green chile pork, and BBQ Pork. Yes, is the answer to your question, I do love pork. The guacamole and the nachos as appetizers are great, I could keep ordering these they are that good. Then there is the Grilled Street Corn. If my review was helpful in picking this place, do not...I repeat...DO NOT forget to try this special treat.  **Hold on I need to wipe the saliva from my mouth.**  I went with a large group of friends on one occasion. I feel for the waiters when this happens but our waiter Manny (Great Name by the way) handled it like a P-R-O! He was on the drinks like no other, his recommendations from the menu were extremely helpful for the guys who hadn't been there. The courtesy this guy extended was above and beyond and he deserved every cent of the tip we left him. I went in for a quick bite after work recently and he is now behind the bar. Soon as I sat down he had my Mango Jalapeno Margarita ready, which I oh so love.  Only reason I didn't give it an extra star was because the first time I went here, my carne asada tacos were cold and the waiter was slightly rude but only because the place was packed. Understandable. But still, don't sleep on this place, great food nonetheless."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Fox restaurants and this one did not disappoint.  The service was amazing, the food was great and by mid-meal, we were discussing the date of a return visit.  Everyone from the hostess, to the bartender, and the servers went over and beyond to make sure we had an amazing experience.  I had the fish tacos and they were delish!  My hubby had three different tacos and enjoyed them all.  We topped it off with sopapillas - also yummy.  Best lunch experience I've had in a while."}
{"text":"One of my go to, favorite, southwest cuisine.  Fox Restaurant Concepts knocked it our of the park with this one!  Great food, service and location!  I come here every time I am in the Biltmore for lunch.  I recommend the queso dip and the Short Rib ANYTHING!!"}
{"text":"Same, Same, but different!  The best part about this chain, is it is good and consistent.  I love it here and will continue to visit whichever location is closest to me.  The service at this location is amazing!  The outdoor patio is wonderful when weather permits."}
{"text":"Sold me a 100.00 gift  card with a bouns 20.00 card for myself over the holidays. Went to use the 20.00 dollar card tonight and they told me it had already been used. Yes cashed in just one day before my 100.00 amx purchase. I guess they are into recycled plastic or rip off"}
{"text":"This place has great decor and even better service. I came in mid-day on a Wednesday. It wasn't crowded nor empty. I was seated promptly and given complimentary chips and salsa which were very good. I had the Mexican salad with the mahi tuna. The salad was decent but the fish was delicious. I felt well attended and loved sitting outside to enjoy the sunny weather."}
{"text":"This is outstanding in every respect. If you are looking for a new way and an innovative twist on Mexican- this is your place. Cocktails- try the blood orange margarita.   Guacamole, cheese crisp w with braised beef, salsa verde, street tacos- delicious!  Kay was our server and she was friendly and very attentive.  Truly a restaurant concept that is 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised that we were there during happy hour. Alot of restaurants don't do that on weekends. Had never been here before but will be back. Our server Brandon was amazing and super helpful and friendly. With it being happy hour we got to try alot of small options at a great price. The street Tacos were tasty, the 3 dip trio was yummy, chips and salsa on par. The drink specials were great too. Got the berry margarita. Yum. Will be back, highly recommended"}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW: The owner (Nate) responded to my post almost immediately and contacted me in an attempt to resolve the issue and to maintain my business as a customer. I have never seen such an involved, caring owner/manager as Nate and I truly admire that. All business owner's should aspire to be like this. My voice was heard, understood, and action is taking place so I am looking forward to coming back to this location for a new experience!   INITIAL REVIEW: Ok dine-in service and terrible takeout service (forget it). I say this not because things are slow-moving, but because the people they have working at this location have bad attitudes and don't treat you well unless you're buying a drink and they see a big tip opportunity for themselves. It's a big shame too because the food really is so great."}
{"text":"I've been to Blanco's a ton of times, but I keep forgetting to write down my review, so here it goes:  Fox Concept restaurants are, by far, my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. I'm a huge fan of Olive & Ivy (check out my review), and Blanco's Tacos & Tequila. We come here for lunch about once a month in a group of 6 or so. It's pretty conveniently located too for anyone in the Old Town area.   Since I'm a regular here, i can speak on consistency. Their service is always great. I've read multiple reviews complaining about the service and I've never experienced it, and I've been here for lunch and dinner. The food is also always good, never disappoints.  Food: I always get tacos. I've tried 4 different types: fish, chicken, carnitas, and carne asada. My fave is always the carne asada, but the rest are great. The beans are boring, but that's pretty much anywhere you go. Let's talk about that rice: What the heck do they put in that rice?! Cheese? cream? I don't know, but it's an ongoing mystery with my fellow Blanco's guests. I can't describe how delish it really is, you just have to try it yourself.   The only thing my husband doesn't like is the serving size. Personally, I think it's perfect, but he's a big man, so he needs a lot of food. Just watch out for appetizers, that's where my bill tends to add up quickly.   Kids meals are good and not much different than most other mexican establishments."}
{"text":"Great food. We had the red sangria and it was light and refreshing.  The cheese crisp with the braised pork was light and so fresh. You have to try the street corn. It was great on the cheese crisp. They let you mix up the tacos so you can try the variety. We ended with the mexican chocolate cake. Great end to a great anniversary.  Our server was Ganby and she is a main reason we will be back. You guys rocked it."}
{"text":"Outside Ambiance was fantastic, as we sipped out margaritas and enjoyed the warm night ari!  we got the cheese crips and guacamole for a quick appetizer night out with friends and the guac was amazing with just the right amount of garlic! we had a hard time getting a table on a saturday night (the wait seems to always be longer than they tell you it will be), but upon coming back on sunday, we were easily able to get a table outdoors."}
{"text":"We have been here over 4 times now. If it weren't for the great food we would have never returned! Service is slacking to say the least. Sometimes your lucky to even get a server to greet you once you have sat down. Heaven forbid you need a refill good luck. You might as well go in the kitchen and get it yourself. Lack of menu knowledge is surprising with a company that has so many restaurants. You would think they would know how to train their staff. My suggestion maybe sit at the bar where someone is forced to actually serve you. Or better yet get it Togo. There interactions should include more then pushing items on the menu that you don't want!! On the food end keep it up!! On the service end fire and start fresh!"}
{"text":"Had  areally fun time here with a big group after Spring Training! Big long tables in thse bar are great for big groups- simple menu worked for vegetarians in our group too. Sangria was so-so, but that's what I get for ordering it when I should have had a margarita!"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you are in the mood for Mexican. Very cool atmosphere and their tacos are wonderful. I'm a picky eater but the chicken tacos were very good. My favorite part? Their margarita was incredible!! If you like margaritas, do yourself a favor and grab one of these. My fianc√© and I went here twice and the first time we sat inside and had great customer service.   The second time (and the reason for 3 stars) we sat outside and we're almost forgotten by our waiter. I felt like every time we needed him he was no where to be found (and the place wasn't very busy). Also, I decided to try a mixed drink this time around and it was awful. It had so much alcohol I couldn't even drink it. It tasted like a shot (and yes I stirred it well)! I immediately very politely told the waiter it was too strong and he still charged us for it!! Which I thought was rude and not the best customer service. Other than that experience, the place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The name pretty much says enough for the whole review:  Blanco TACOS AND TEQUILA....what more do you need.  Okay, the food was yummy, and service was top-notch!  We had the guacamole (huge serving)  and a cheese crisp with beef and avocado that was very tasty, but don't miss out on one of the 30+ tequila's in your margarita!  I had their \"classic\"  on-the-rocks-with-salt and it was perfect.  The BEST thing about this restaurant is that it's casual and a spot for anyone.  You don't expect that at \" The Borgata\", but it's a fact-check it out!  We saw everything from a large group of business people, ladies with their children and 2 young guys hangin' at the bar.  Love it and hope to be back soon for a full meal or-- just drinks.   All Fox restaurants are having a killer happy hour special running through the summer so check them out!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  I can't believe it took me this long to try this joint out, I don't know what is wrong with me!  Ambience: It's located in the beautiful Borgata - well, its beautiful for now, who know once the Condos come in - with two patios: a larger one in front, facing Scottsdale Road (but far enough back that its relaxing) with two awesome fire pits and a smaller patio section on the side. The wall that separates the front patio from the inside of the restaurant is constructed of windows that are able to be raised (like a garage door) to allow an open feel. Today, however, the windows were down since it was a little chilly and despite having heaters on the patio, we decided to sit inside, but next to the window so we could stare at the fire pit. The inside decor reminds me of a Southern beach home with the crisp white ceiling with exposed painted beams and the pops of color with bar stools and tables, which is really fun, but also relaxing. There are two TV's that face each other which limits their viewing to only one side of the restaurant and I also noticed a small, unoccupied DJ booth. We came here for lunch and although there was not a DJ the music was loud and the genre being played is something you might find at a dance club.  The food: We started with the Cheese and Guacamole Cheese Crisp ($9) and two iced teas. While we were waiting for our app and deciding on what we wanted for lunch, we were brought chips and salsa. The salsa wasn't anything special, but the chips were of higher quality than other Mexican restaurants. Also of higher quality was our cheese crisp. I still can't believe how enjoyable it was and I think its because of the mix of cheeses they use (Oaxaca, Asadero and Monterey).  I don't know it, but its definitely an app that should be tried! For our entrees we both went with the tacos, one order of grilled fish ($13.5) and an order of their award winning (the award came from the Taco Festival per the server) slow cooked BBQ pork ($11). Both entrees came with their rice which has corn mixed in and your choice of black or charro beans (pinto beans with bacon). We both enjoyed our entrees which each came with three, palm-sized tacos and we couldn't make any criticism regarding the food or the service. We had a great time.  I took off a star because of the higher prices, I know its supposed to be \"upscale\" mexican, but $9 for a cheese crisp is pretty step no matter how delicious it is. Regardless, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Blancos never disappoints! Took some out of town guests there tonight and they commented on the atmosphere, music and overall vibe! I consistently get the fajita's I recommend getting two choices for just a few dollars more and a lot more food. We got a quest dip that was sooo good! Pro Tip- sign up for their email, you will get $10 off your first order & other great deals! Definitely check out Blanco's for your modern Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Ehhh... this place is incredibly mediocre. I had heard the food was good so when my boss offered to take me, I was excited. The atmosphere is just blah. Taneko was such a beautiful restaurant and so rich and warm, and Fox just seemed to throw a ton of cans of white paint on the interior and ruined what was a very beautiful dining room. But I get it, with the whole beach theme... it's just kind of ugly now.   The chips and salsa were just okay. The salsa better than the chips. I had heard the enchiladas were good, but I opted for a heathier option and ordered the chicken tacos with corn tortillas. The tacos were incredibly average. I had to scoop out most of the pico de gallo just so that I could hold them. The beans were beans and the rice is not your average Spanish rice, but just white rice with butter and corn. I completely missed any authenticity of real Mexican food. The waitress highly recommended the flan, and I am not normally a fan of flan but we ordered one anyway. I would have rather eaten a Jell-O pudding cup, honestly. It was nothing special at all.   I would honestly not waste my money here if you are wanting real Mexican food. This place doesn't have it."}
{"text":"The greatest place for a girls brunch or co-ed get together. Our waitress Josie was so warm and detail oriented that we could not have asked for anything better, but then our drinks and appetizers were brought by cute men which was fun also. Big long bar and shared seating tables is so fun but outdoor patio is intimate and adorable as well. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I just don't get how this place is popular. The only redeeming items here are their overpriced guac and overpriced margaritas. All the food is very average, with very little flavor. Do yourself a favor and go pretty much anywhere else in Scottsdale for better options at a lower price."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and the service was really good.   The chips and salsa were appetizing.   The main entrees were good but I can't say the were over the top.   If you want good Mexican food with a twist and great atmosphere this is your place.   I would visit this place regularly if I lived in Scottsdale.   But I felt it was priced a little high for tacos and chips."}
{"text":"Downright amazing. Get the cheese crisps.. the tacos were perfect also. The service could not have been better, from the moment we walked in, to the check, every person was beyond friendly and welcoming. The chips were way salty today but otherwise an amazing meal."}
{"text":"Wow this used to be one of my favorites.  When we were seated we were told that there is a reservation soon and would need to be done in an hour.  I did not know restaurants had time restrictions. Wish we were told that before waiting almost an hour.  Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. Had the tortilla soup and carne asada tacos it was excellent definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"How good can a cheese crisp be?! Come here and find out! All of the cheese crisps are delicious but my favorite one is the short rib and avacado. I've had a few of their tacos. None of them are mind blowing but they're good. I would reccommend the crispy shrimp taco and the fish taco. Margaritas are great. Everyone I bring to Blanco ends up loving it as much as I do. This is one of the few restaurants I will go to knowing I have to wait because it's that good!"}
{"text":"Solid solid Tex-mex. Took an out of towner here, as she is extremely sensitive to spicy foods- but still loves Mexican.... And this place was perfect. She had the pork enchiladas and couldn't stop raving about them!"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, this place is pretty awesome.  I'm sure there may be something on the menu that doesn't meet the 5-star criteria, but personally, I had a braised short rib and avocado cheese crisp with a couple of grey hounds, and that was delicious!  The chips are a step above MANY and MOST other restaurants and the salsa and guacamole is simply superb.  If you are disappointed, you are either a snob, or you got bad service.  Our waiter was great, and had plenty of patience for how annoying we probably seemed. ;)"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! Loved it! The hot fudge sundae amazing! Wish we had one in California! Our server was really good friendly and on top of things I believe his name was Joesue."}
{"text":"I've driven by a number of times and never stopped in. Glad we did this time. The place was a little busy but not bad and we were seated fairly quickly. The service was good. Drinks and food we're all tasty."}
{"text":"Blanco is one of my favorite Fox Concept restaurants. They have delicious tacos and the best margs in the area.   Can you say \"Hora Feliz?!\" Don't miss out on this happy hour. The margs are $6 and made with Jose Cuervo. The pomegranate is my favorite - it's refreshing and tasty!  They also have a great deal on the guac, queso, and bean dip during HH. But who are we kidding, the chips and salsa are to die for! I think I ate three bowls by myself..."}
{"text":"I had a perfectly nice evening.  I'm not a big fan of the Fox restaurants and it is getting to the point that you can't eat out in Phoenix without eating at one of Sam Fox's restaurants.    We have been in several times because it's casual, close to home and the bar staff is friendly.  I'm a fan of the Shrimp Salad and my partner usually goes for the fish tacos.  The food is good.  We keep coming back because the wait staff is friendly.  So why only three stars.  On our last visit there was weird burnt stuff in my salad that turned out to be charcoal.  The staff was accommodating about the situation, took the food back, and bought us a round of drinks, but yeeech...Anyway, it's a good casual place for dinner."}
{"text":"The blood organge margarita was the best part of my meal. The complementary chips and salsa were decent but the chips were thick. I had the braised green chili pork tacos and they were loaded way to much with the pork filling. The side of rice was mushy and overdone. The decor is pretty awesome but I would not go again unless it was happy hour."}
{"text":"I went there with my BF yesterday for a late lunch and it was an amazing experience. It was our first time there. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Our server was attentive and was quick in taking out orders and checking in with us  every few mins. I had the Cheese and Guacamole Crisps which were to die for. It's like an open quesadilla over a crisp tortilla very different and delicious. My bf had Enchiladas. Now they were not your normal enchiladas. They were served in a bowl with the tortilla in the bottom, filling over it and then covered with a layer of cheese with rice and beans on the side. We've been to many Mexican restaurants, but this was an interesting concept that we enjoyed. The ambiance is amazing. Perfect for a date night or family dinner. There's outside seating where you can sit around the fire. There's also a fully stocked bar in the middle which is very pretty and tvs around to watch teh game. Overall a great experience and would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a fabulous Father' Day dinner tonight!  First time we have been to this restaurant and we will definitely be back!  Our server, Tony, was outstanding, and made our total experience wonderful and was refreshing when customer service is lacking in most establishments today.  The chips and salsa were amazing and the habanero salsa is a MUST ask for.  I had the tacos and was pleased that when I couldn't make up my mind because they all sounded so good, that I could mix and match.  I ordered the crispy shrimp, carne asada and the BBQ tacos.  They were all delicious but the BBQ was my favorite (and I can see why it is award winning).  My husband ordered the short ribs burrito and it was incredible.  The beans and rice were pretty good, but I was too full from the tacos and chips.    We are so glad we found a new local restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Blanco! We went during happy hour and sampled many items. Blood orange margaritas, hibiscus margaritas, guac, nachos, requires- all were excellent...and half price!! We had a cute little waitress Chloe who was sweet and very attentive. Saw no pretentious, snotty people as mentioned in previous reviews, just happy customers and employees. Thanks Blanco!"}
{"text":"The food is just ok, I've never been disappointed but I've also never been wowed. I try not to judge by service, but this place has some of the worst service. Lunch \"hour\" turns into 2 hours because everyone moves at a snails pace. The only saving grace is the chocolate cake. It's fantastic, this the extra star."}
{"text":"With a table of four. Took quite a while for the 4th menue and set up to arrive. Two of us loves the queso flatbreads. The pulled pork is great.  Don't order the bloody mary.....out of a bottle and really meh.  Our waitress was fairly attentive at first ( early lunch, before much of a crowd) but forgot items asked for.  Lovely for outdoor eating."}
{"text":"We landed at this restaurant on a whim.  Service was excellent - 5 STARS Food was okay - 2-1/2-3 STARS  CHIPS - too thick but had good flavor SALSA - was tasty  PORK TACOS - Very good  CARNE ASADA TACOS (extra crispy) - Absolutely the worst I've ever had!  They were so dry! The taco was a store bought white corn tortilla and baked - completely fell apart at the first bite.  Nothing in the taco but the meat and a little lettuce - it was so frickin dry and tasteless I asked for sour cream - it didn't help.  RICE - White rice, a little corn and seasoned well.  Very different than typical Mexican rice. It was okay.  PINTO BEANS - served in a little dish, tasted okay, very little cheese (goat I think)  if any.  This is not typical Mexican food - I find it's more of a healthy version.  Prices were steep - $14.00 for the Taco meal.  Also, portions are small.  Waitress asked if everything was okay and normally never do this but I told her, \"they were the worst tacos I ever had.  They were so dry and just completely fell apart.  Obviously your restaurant doesn't cook with a lot of cheese,\" I said.  She was nice enough to remove my meal from the bill - hence 3 stars.  I think for many of us eating at restaurants everyone has a good or bad experience.  Usually though with a first bad experience we tend not to go back. End of story."}
{"text":"Had tacos and the queso. Dip was good. Tacos were fine. The place was a little pricey but we got there at happy hour so got a deal. Bartender was reallynice."}
{"text":"WOW! I loved this place. I was very surprised because one doesn't typically have great Mexican food, just okay Mexican food. I ordered the short rib enchiladas with green sauce (my server's recommendation), they were amazing!!! The rice side tasted like buttery popcorn, I rarely eat rice, but it was so good! I am normally a very laid back person and don't get excited over much, but I seriously couldn't believe how good this place was, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were visiting my husbands mom and decided to go grab a bite to eat. Since we love mexican food we used our GPS to find us one close to where we were. We thought it was taking us to El Torito (which I love) but, apparently it closed and this was in its place.   The food wasn't bad but, it wasn't great either. I would go again IF we had no other choice.  The salsa was gross but, the chips were ok. I mean how can you get tacos wrong, right? Well, they managed to do that, lol. The tortilla was actually soggy which tells me the dish was sitting there a while.   The guacamole is premade too. And you can tell."}
{"text":"Recommended by the front desk at the Camby Hotel. Started with a classic margarita and the white peach margarita. Both excellent. Ordered happy hour quesadilla and dips. Very tasty. Happy hour is very popular here and gets crowded until 6. We were sitting at the bar and The service was very attentive, it appeared to be that way all around the restaurant.  I would return if in the area again."}
{"text":"The tacos were delicious! The margaritas were fantastic. Out waitress was very accommodating and attentive to our needs. Will Def be back!"}
{"text":"It seems like the more Fox restaurants I visit the more I realize that the food is just second fiddle in their quest for hipness.  And since I'm not a hipster doofus a lot of their effort rings hollow.    The location is cool and patio allows you to enjoy the unique Spanish influenced architecture of the Borgata.  The decor, like all Fox restaurants, is hip and well executed.  The ambiance is perfect for the happy hour crowd.  Unfortunately I typically don't number myself with that group.  The music was too loud and stiffed any attempts to enjoy the wider ambiance.  A highlight were the chips.  They were dense and very close to those that I enjoyed while I lived in the Mexico.  We tried a number of dishes and they were all perfectly above average.  The cheese crisp was good but only warm and not worth the $10.  The carne asada tacos were good, positive nod to the creamed rice, but the price once again wasn't truly justified.  The salmon was tasty and well presented with the spinach, corn, and squash.  It was very nicely cooked but a tad fishy in taste.  We wrapped up the meal with the tres leches cake and, like everything else, it was good but not especially memorable.  So in summary, Fox restaurants- Blanco included- are good places to be seen but not necessarily the best places for distinctive and memorable food.  The food is good but I doubt its the real reason why so many people frequent them."}
{"text":"Wow. Al I can say. My wife and I just went here and the happy hour menu is amazing. We got two tacos and two tortas plus a trio dip as an appetizer. From the first taste of everything is was an explosion of greatness. Highly recommend this place and will definitely go back. Ps the white peach hibiscus margarita was the perfect taste of tangy and sweet. Must go here, and our waitress was phenomenal (Lisa)"}
{"text":"We we were looking for a good Mexican food place that was not the typical hole in the wall. This food and restaurant exceeded our expectations. I am very picky with my Mexican food and Blancos was fantastic! Service was also very good as he was constantly checking on us and making sure things were going well. Was very happy we found this place. Delicious tres leches too!"}
{"text":"I work at the Biltmore Fashion Park and Blanco's is my favorite place for nibbles during my breaks!! I love the little sidewalk area to order quick to go orders and it's lovely to dine in the park area as well! The tacos, dips and chips are always tasty and fresh with lots of meat chunks! The staff is always helpful and friendly too!! Thanks Blanco!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving to Blanco Tacos + Tequila for the first time, I was more than pleased with the entire experience. The salsa was scrumptious and so was the blood orange margarita! Our server Jaclyn was super knowledgeable and recommended the amazing sweet corn and braised short rib quesadilla. I am so thankful that Jaclyn was there to steer us in the right direction and will absolutely be back to this restaurant to try more of her mouth watering recommendations!"}
{"text":"I went here for a birthday dinner and most of us got tacos and I wasn't all that impressed. The chips and salsa was probably the best place I've had chips and salsa though. The service was okay, not the best.  Kind of pricey. But I'm giving it four stars because I would recommend it and it wasn't a horrible experience. The chocolate fudge cake was absolutely amazing and worthy of 5 stars alone."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time yesterday and thought the atmosphere was smart, current and open.  Menu was diverse and unique enough and there was a lot to tempt me, a big fresh-Mex fan.    Service was undeniably slow and drinks were especially under-served.  This was a shame, as my cohorts were sloshin' it up and the proprietor could have generated some serious revenue on those margs if someone was willing to serve them!   I had the shrimp tacos which weren't nearly as good as the shrimp/ancho tacos at Jasper's Bistro, but still quite tasty and served hot.  Chips & salsa are great, too.    All in all, only the service brought us down.  It's never fun to have to ask for something twice, right? But one server does not kill a restaurant for me...I'll give them another chance and I'm hopeful they'll figure it out!"}
{"text":"Wow, where do I begin?  Let's start with the service.  We sat at the bar and our tender was Amazing!   He recommended the enchiladas and they were dope.  Both margaritas were fantastic!  Especially the mango habanero.  My friend even spilled hers accidentally and they got us another free of charge without us even asking.  He suggested free sides of pico and jalaps which made the meal.  Then when I pulled out my 50 percent off manager card because I work for another restaurant within the company he was shocked!  Im so happy regular guests get this level Of service on the daily. . I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to the blanco rapido section . Just two tacos to go . Pastor chicken . Absolutely delicious !! Nothing else to say . I will be back again"}
{"text":"We ate here twice on our trip to Phoenix and we never do that! Amazing drunk selections and fresh ingredients.  Prices are reasonable staff helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"Amazing Food and Service  Blanco Tacos  + Tequila was recommended by a friend and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Blanco Tacos  is really trendy and cool. Blanco Taco is an open restaurant and can get loud at times however, I enjoy the energy inside the restaurant.   Our server  suggested the short rib enchilada and short rib tacos.  Both entr√©e's were fantastic.  The enchiladas are served inside a hot pan with melt in your mouth short ribs.  The short rib tacos are served with black beans or charro beans, rice, which was served with white corn and are some of the best tacos I've ever had. If you make your way to Blanco Tacos  you have to sample the guacamole it is fresh and absolutely delicious.    The house margarita's are good, esoecially the orange blood. Fresh food, great drinks, incredible outside seating area and very friendly wait staff make Blanco Taco + Tequila a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place so.my friend and I were hungry one night and decided to go here.  It is going to be the new hangout. The salsas were great, you get three kinds and I think I love the green one the best.  Tried three tacos but I.think.my favorite was the carnitas, the flavor was a party.  Also can't forget about the guacamole, loved it! We were full and satisfied when we left!"}
{"text":"Walked in with no reservation and got sat immediately, must have been luck because soon after this place was poppin. Ordered the queso and street corn for an app and both were fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere.  We regularly meet friends here, and it's always a good time.  The atmosphere gives this good-food place its fourth star - the patio, booths, tables, etc. are great for socializing.  The service is friendly and the drinks are great.  Between our friends, we've sampled lots of items on the menu and everything is pretty fresh and yummy - not mind-blowing, but solid.  Highlights include the grilled fish or roasted mushroom tacos - yum!  The cheese crisps are great, too.  I'd definitely recommend the guacamole to go with the chips and salsa - I defy you not to fill up on these."}
{"text":"Megan, the girl with the reddish hair is awesome. I always get my drink and chips/salsa right away. Order is always correct, food is incredible. You can tell she is hardworking and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb I had the beef enchilada and it was probably the best one I've ever had in my life and I've been to Mexico many times so it ran me about $35 with two tequila margaritas and it was well worth it I recommend it to anyone top-notch guys keep up the good work"}
{"text":"I had a better experience today than a few years ago!  I had the taco trio: crispy shrimp, BBQ pork, and grilled fish.  I liked them all in that order.  I also had black beans and veggies (instead of rice) on the side.  Both sides were yummy."}
{"text":"This is absolutely a place to try. If you are looking for a new hip restaurant, here is a suggestion! The food is definitely good..a tex-mex style and not lacking any flavor. Except the quesadillas. Those definitely weren't good. I personally wouldn't go to a restaurant and order a $10ish quesadilla, buuutt once a friend did and there really was barely enough cheese to say it was a quesadilla instead of a plain tortilla. Anyway, I've ordered a few of their tacos and their enchiladas. I would recommend their tacos first, of course, really because they were darn cool. their flavors combinations were interesting and definitely worked.  Now, on to their margaritas. If you aren't hungry and jonesing for a margarita, ABSOLUTELY go to Blanco Taco. They have more than the typical margarita flavors and again, they make the atypical flavors totally work. Flavors like blood orange, Sweetart, and I'm pretty sure Ive even had a rosemary margarita there..it might not have been rosemary but something floral nonetheless."}
{"text":"Tried them out for lunch today and was not impressed, not inspired, but I am pleasantly full.  Their prices are *gasp* fairly decent for being in the Borgata on Scottsdale and I would definitely recommend them for lunch.  We had their \"famous\" guacamole which was honestly not flavored enough.  Everything tasted good, but didn't leave me saying \"wow.\""}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for business, it was a beautiful day, and I was in the mood to sit on a patio. I stopped into Blanco and was able to get a seat at the bar outside. I ordered a white peach and hibiscus margarita, it was incredibly delish and refreshing!! I also ordered the marinated chicken, the chips and salsa were dress. The tacos came with black beans and rice! It was all tasty! Similar to what I was expecting, but service was great! Food was really really good! I could get used this life in the sun!!   Biltmore Fashion Plaza has free 2 hour parking, so grab your token and get it validated!!"}
{"text":"One of the first things that you should know about this place is that it's \"modern\" Mexican food. What does that mean exactly? It means that you're not going to find traditional taco shop grub here. Good news is that that's not a bad thing. Although some menu items may seem a little too upscale for Mexican food, I suggest throwing your preconceptions out the window and trying something new. The black beans are absolutely amazing! If you're not feeling too adventurous, try a burrito bowl."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Waitress was good even though there was a miscommunication about drinks (not her fault). We ordered cheese dip which was very good as are the chips and salsa. I ordered a green chili pork burrito enchilada style and my husband got the chicken mole. We both enjoyed our food and the atmosphere is nice. It may be a little loud for some, but we didn't have to shout to talk to each other. We would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are great. I can't believe I'm now reviewing chips and salsa. Lunch was fish tacos and are very good, similar to others serving 3 small round tacos these days. It comes with good white 'something in it' rice and black beans. Service always good. Sat at the outside bar at Biltmore on a perfect day. Could be worse."}
{"text":"Great experience!!  Came with a group of 9 very picky eaters! Everyone's needs were accommodated from vegetarian to simple kids meals.   I ordered the queso crisp which was like a Mexican pizza. Pretty large portion, probably not meant for one person. But sooo good. Not overly done.   Taco selection is very diverse and obviously gooood.  Note for vegetarians! Rice is cooked in chicken stock!!   And request light cheese for cheese enchiladas!  Ambience was great; really good selection of drinks too"}
{"text":"Skinny Margarita, shrimp taco, mushroom taco!! Gluten friendly. Waitress was very nice, efficient Share your tacos and you get 4 with no extra charge."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we loved it! The tacos were small but to die for! We tried BBQ, braised beef, and chipotle shrimp. I also tried the green chile pork enchiladas. The guacamole was fresh and excellent although a bit overpriced for the amount you get. Great environment and location. We will definitely be back. I only took one star away because we spent more than I anticipated for a lunch for four."}
{"text":"5 stars! I love this place and I continue to go back all the time! This is by far my favorite fox concept restaurant. I decided to write this review due to my experience last Night. (Being a busy Friday night) I had just gotten off of work, the entire time being at work I couldn't help but crave and fantasize about Blanco's guac (my fav) so therefore I made myself a promise to get some after work to for-fill my craving. As arriving to the place I had realized how busy It was, not surprising considering they always have good business due to their awesomeness. As I walked in I was even more overwhelmed by the crowd and how hard everyone was working. I talked to kind gentleman who I explained I just wanted to get some guac and chips to go and he explained how I could go to the bar and they'll help me out there! (Perfect no problem most restaurants work this way, I know this because I work in the industry) I then walked over to the bar just to realize It was very crowded I felt awkward and in the way, so at this point I was feeling quite stressed and hangry. It only took about maybe a minute for the kind gentleman that I talked to earlier to rush to my rescue and becoming my guac super hero and saving the day. When he found out I had not been checked out he took initiative and made my dreams come true. He took It upon himself to check me out and do what others could not. A BIG THANK YOU TO NATE!!!!!!!!! Dear FCR he needs more praise and recognition for his hard work and hospitality he definitely impressed me and considering this type of qualities you teach in your employees I think he definitely deserves an extra something special for exceeding these expectations. THANKS AGAIN!! As far as blancos goes they have amazing food and I have never had a bad experience BUT THIS ONE BLEW me away for the amazing service Nate had granted me wish I could give him 6 stars if only that was a thing"}
{"text":"Had an unbelievable experience last night taking my friend out for his bday.  Andrea and Raymond, our servers, were super attentive and friendly.  The GM Harry even came over to educate us on some tequilas that were never tried and his choices were superb.  He really seems to enjoy his job and it shows.  Our wives enjoyed the sizzling fajitas platters, my machaca burrito was great and the kids menu had plenty of options for our little daughter.  Were usually hit up the one in Scottsdale but this Biltmore location always seem to exceed our expectations with service so it's worth the extra miles driving."}
{"text":"Good service, good food. Quick with the refills. Did not provide straws for our drinks until we asked, which we thought was a little weird, but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"On first glance at the menu it looked like you were obligated to order the same three tacos for the trio so I'm glad I mentioned it to our server, since I couldn't decide between the Mahi and the House special pork taco. I brought up Joyride as a comparison and she didn't miss a beat: \"You can choose three different here as well, and I guarantee you you're going to like our tacos better!\" She wasn't wrong. I totally savored the variety of my choices (third taco was the grilled avocado), and thought all were so delicious, I didn't regret choosing one over the other.  The flavor pairings are exceptional here, as is the service and the ambiance. We were warmly welcomed by our hostess, who patiently put up with our indecisiveness about whether to sit inside or out, and who put us at a booth right next to the patio as the perfect compromise. Our server Emerald was  friendly, informative and incredibly attentive. Top notch! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite spots to come when I lived in Scottsdale... try the grilled fish salad... it is so fresh... and the salad dressing with it is amazing as well.  PS: sit outside one night there to dine... the ambience is spectacular."}
{"text":"Your average Mexican food joint with a patio. The food is good and the atmosphere is buzzing. Paul Matins next door helps the draw plus Trader Joe's and Fogo are there as well.  Cool are as further north are many new concept restaurants and resorts inclusive of the Scottsdale Plaza Resort and Remington's fine dining venue.  The place is fine. However, I was hoping for different. We shall look on for the optimal experience. Richardson's is winning that race currently. #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"Solid place with a cool vibe and decor.  Had lunch earlier this week.  The guacamole was ok, nothing special.  I actually liked the salsa.  Had the BBQ pork tacos and they were very good, my wife had the mexican chopped salad and was satisfied.  Definitely a cool place to hang out for drinks/apps after work."}
{"text":"Well you just can't beat this place for great Mexican food. Yes, it's in Scottsdale but worth the drive from Chandler because there are no great Mexican places near here. Outside patio is perfect for early dinner. Not a drinker but they are famous for their bar."}
{"text":"I went to Blanco Tacos + Tequila in Scottsdale with my family for my birthday dinner. This is another one of Sam Fox's restaurants, and it serves up modern Mexican fare. Our party of five all got a ton of food that definitely required to-go boxes throughout the meal.  The atmosphere at Blanco totally didn't surprise me, considering it's a Fox eatery. There was the open kitchen, huge hanging lights, centrally located bar and airy feel. It was chic and dimly lit with candlelight, but there were televisions throughout broadcasting football games. It was a great mix of casual and fancy, making it the type of place where it's perfectly acceptable to go and just down a couple margaritas, or have a fun dinner date.  I started with the Blood Orange Margarita ($9), which you should get with salt even though it's a little sweet. It was a strong drink, and the sweetness wasn't overpowering.  For my meal, I started with the housemade guacamole to go with our tasty chips and spicy salsa, then had cheese enchiladas and finished with a Tres Leche cake. The guacamole was so amazing, other people at the table were also inspired to order it for their starter. I really liked the cheese enchiladas, but, as my mom pointed out, they're more modern in that they're not smothered and dripping with cheese. Instead, they're covered in an interesting creamy ancho sauce. I guess I prefer traditional cheese enchiladas, but there was still a ton of cheese inside the tortillas that made me happy.  The cake was really interesting. Someone compared it to a bread pudding, since it was really crumbly and wet because it was drenched in a milky sauce. I liked it, but it was too rich to finish.  Altogether, I thought the meal was an excellent deal. I would definitely go back for the lively ambiance and tasty take on Mexican food."}
{"text":"We went to the quick side window they have opened for passerby's.  This is their quick fast food section.  We ordered the dips, machaca beef tacos, bbq pork tortas, and a strawberry frescha drink.  The strawberry frescha had a good taste but tasted so diluted.  3-stars.  The bbq pork tortas had a decent taste except the bbq sauce was *so sweet*.  3-stars.  She said the machaca beef tacos were good.  The dips were queso (good), guacamole (good), and charro beans (decent).  Overall 3.5 stars for dips.  This is quick, convenient fun fast food to eat while you are shopping.  We will be back.  Next time, we may try the sit down restaurant and order more interesting items."}
{"text":"What a delicious addition to Biltmore Fashion Park! I'm so happy Blanco opened their doors in this space at the outdoor mall. Not only is their sitdown service perfect after a day of shopping or for a night out, but they also have a walk-up window that's perfect for a quick lunchtime meal.   During a recent visit, I enjoyed a lovely meal complete with a skinny margarita, housemade guacamole and a combination of three different street tacos. The meal was fabulous and the service was spot on. While we sat in the restaurant I noticed the bar and decided that I will be coming back soon to enjoy a casual drink and snack. I will also be back soon to order lunch of tacos or salad from the walk-up window. Sam Fox has done it again!"}
{"text":"Another solid experience at Blanco! As a part of restaurant week, I stopped by Blanco...mainly just because I have been craving the delicious tacos, but then I remembered that it's restaurant week, so one entree turned into a three course dinner. Am I complaining? Absolutely not.   We started with the guacamole and avocado and pork cheese crisp. As usual, both were excellent. Their cheese crisps are amazing. I tried the veggie crisp during a previous visit. Phenomenal. Everyone should order it. So moving on to the entrees, even though we were stuffed to the brim after the guac and crisp, we tried the fish tacos and pork enchiladas. While the fish tacos were tasty and the norm, the pork enchiladas blew anything else out of the water.The pork is lean and fresh and sitting in gooey cheese, sauce and within a crunchy taco. It comes with a creamy rice and pico. Excellent.   To wash it down, I sipped on my favorite skinny margarita cocktail. I think they mix their skinny marg with sour and soda water and maybe with a hint of sprite? Whatever they do, it makes a fair weather margarita fan into a full pledged fan immediately!   Waiter Jeremy was pleasant, friendly and completely attentive! The staff at Blanco are top notch. I know that when I visit, I'm in good hands and Jeremy confirmed this with the service tonight!"}
{"text":"First time and enjoyed the lunch experience with the \"prison\" dressed waiter.  I obviously wasn't the first to notice the \"uniforms\" and asked where was Sheriff Joe's pink underpants.  He almost responded with a show and tell but refrained from exposure.  While waiting the grey cracked large beam ceiling, blue colored upholstery and miles of small tile on the wall make for a contrasting visual experience.  I started with a draft XX larger  and started munching on thick and tasty chips.  Muy bueno with a large portion of mild salsa!!! I then ordered the ahi seared tuna with two soft tacos & black beans.  Muy bueno with small chunks of tuna and chopped veggies - just the right combination of flavors and color!!!  While eating it was hard not to notice the waiters with horizontal striped shirts and casual blue/grey jeans.  Most of them carried a holster for their order books plus an extra towel or two hanging just below almost to their knees.  The towels came in handy for clearing tables and seems like a good idea for other restaurants to  adopt - especially in AZ.  I will have to return at Happy Hour between 4 & 6 sometime soon to see how the inside meets the outside via glass garage doors plus half price margaritas."}
{"text":"Ate at Blanco last night.. very corporate and super accommodating.. we had a wonderful time which even surprised me.. stuck to the basics and thought it was the best of the Fox restaurants. Seeing that we've never had a good experience until last night says a lot. Was kind of cool seeing Sam Fox there actually quality controlling everything that was coming out of the kitchen.. though you know he was just annoying everyone, LOL!  Had the short rib cheese crisp and you know what, it was actually crispy and good. Then tried the queso fundido con chorizo.. pretty darn tasty.. the cheese was slightly burnt on the bottom which I just love, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla, oh yeah!   For dinner I ordered the machaca burrito.. is there such a thing as to much meat? I swear it was a whole beef roast wrapped in a tortilla.. the Mr had the green pork enchiladas.. I though those were very tasty but the sides were even tastier.. their rice is like risotto, very creamy! Helen Y was with us and she ordered the shrimp and crab civiche which I thought was extremely tasty though I would have loved it even more if it were on a toasted baguette! More like a shrimp and crab salad than a civiche though that's just me..   We ended with the tres leches cake.. this was a pretty dismal attempt at tres leches.. was so dense, chewy and sickening sweet. It was so sweet in fact it burnt my throat, pretty gross!  What a great time! Blanco certainly has a fun open atmosphere and a fabulous patio with VERY comfortable seating out there.. you can order dinner up there instead of eating in the dining room which is very cool! Also, the staff was friendly and VERY attractive.. I think for me, this is the best of what Fox Concepts has to offer so far. Definite mass appeal."}
{"text":"My love and I went here for date night... We were greeted and seated right away. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. The house chips and salsa was great! I ordered the steak fajita and a margarita, my husband had the steak enchilada and a Sprite. The food arrived super fast and we killed it! It was soooo good and a nice portion. We will go back again soon. The staff was great as well..."}
{"text":"Well Fox Group has done it again! It seems anytime these people decide to open a new restaurant it's always exactly right! Fox's latest edition is no exception.  I went there 2 days in a row: once for lunch and then for dinner. This place used to be a Ling and Louis Asian place and wasn't all that good. Fox has reinvented the place into Blanco and am I ever glad! Their cocktails and tequilas menus are extensive and they are not skimpy on the pours. I had a classic margarita on the rocks and it was perfect! For lunch my friend and I chose to share the Mexican street corn to compliment the complimentary warm chips and fresh and zippy salsa that they serve very table. Remember: try not to fill up on chips before your food arrives, the portions are generous! My lunch was 3 street style tacos: grilled fish, green chilli pork and grilled chicken. They have a great tacos selection and allow you to mix and match which is great. They were sered with a choice of beans, black or pinto as well as some creamy white rice which was the epitome of comfort food! All delicious and good value! When my wife and I returned the next evening for dinner, we had the shrimp and crab ceviche along with the Chios and salsa,  we were practically full before the mains arrived as the chips and salsa are irresistible! We each chose the lasagna-style enchiladas which are stacked and baked not rolled. She had the beef while I chose the pork. Both came out gooey and very satisfying served up again with the choice if beans as well as that fantastic I-want-to-rub-it-all-over-my-naked-body creamy rice!! Just remembering that meal makes me want to take a nap which is a sign that me likey a lot! The service is up to the Fox standard of excellent. The Fox servers are always great, though one wonders just how much drilling goes on behind the scenes. I worked for big corporate as a bartender and the training can be pretty intense. It's not so much that they seem to love their jobs as much as they seem terrified to screw up and get fired. In any case one rarely gets less than great service at ANY Fox Group establishment, and I frequent several: The Yard, Arrogant Butcher, Norte, True Food Kitchen, Zin Burger to name a few. I am a huge fan if this company and always take my out of town guests in to at least 2 while they are here.  Muchas Gracias Blanco! I'm so glad I can walk to you from my house!"}
{"text":"I went to Blanco with some girlfriends on Saturday. The Margaritas and Guacamole we had were pretty awesome- white peach & hibiscus marg is where it's at! I am not going to lie though, I was not impressed with our entrees. We each got the tacos and they were pretty small- & in my opinion, overpriced. We had a cute waiter though so that made our experience even better. I'm sure I will be returning to Blanco at some point in the future."}
{"text":"What a great place! I can totally see it being a go-to for locals. The food was amazing but the margaritas were even better. (I had the spicy-mango rita at our server's suggestion.) Great price-point to boot. One suggestion - YOU SHOULD OPEN ONE IN COLORADO!!!!"}
{"text":"I was brought here by some friends and co workers. I haven't ever been here and I must say it was perfect. This place was very friendly and very delicious. The shanty was my favorite drink. I highly recommend the chicken mole."}
{"text":"What a great place. We've been here once before when visiting Scottsdale a couple of years ago, and enjoyed it then too. Their outdoor patio is wonderful, service is great. Oh yea, and the food and drinks are outstanding. The guac is yummy (we dialed down spice because of young child, but still very good); the slow cooked BBQ pork tacos were to die for and the cheese quesadilla was surprisingly yummy. LOVED my mojito, and the specialty margaritas were good.   Two thumbs up, will definitely visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty good!  We came in with some friends because it was a meeting point halfway between our houses.  This is a Taco and Marg place on the edge of a mall in a big long row of restaurants.  Lots of parking close by where you take a token and validate in the restaurant.  They have a lot of indoor and nice outdoor seating with a very cool open air bar area.  We all had a variety of margs and they were good but not great.  The freshly cooked chips and salsa were very good.  We all had tacos and they were good (grilled mahi was great!)  but a little small and a little pricey.    We'd come back for sure, most likely during happy hour."}
{"text":"Okay okay so I'm obsessed with Blanco. It's not my fault. Everything is amazing and I come here at least once a month... At least.  The margaritas are fresh, I like the Blood orange and the Mango jalape√±o. Their blended sangria is great too, I don't love the red sangria but when it's mixed with the white, it's really good!  The queso is a must order. I recently I had 5 friends in town and obviously I brought them to Blanco for our first meal- everyone was talking about the queso all weekend. The guac is also pretty good.   Entrees- I used to order the green chili pork enchiladas every time I came in. They are amazing, I highly recommend. Lately, I have be into Mexican chopped salad with steak. The combination of ingredients in this salad are perfect. My boyfriend is into the tacos and is obsessed with the corn they serve here. I don't eat corn but apparently it's delicious.  I really prefer this Blanco over the location at the Biltmore. Something about the Scottsdale location is just better.  Go to Blanco yall- I'm so serious, you can thank me later!"}
{"text":"Had the outside window 2 weeks in a row. Pork and beef tacos and small salad plus fresh lemonade. Outstnding quality fo a great price. I recommend."}
{"text":"Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water. Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to. In Arizona where there's Mexican everywhere, that means something. I haven't had a single thing here that isn't delicious, but their enchiladas are my favorite. I definitely recommend and I look forward to going here time and again!"}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre at best.  For the price of this place, I'm expecting authentic Mexican cuisine.  What I got?  A plate full of over-salted meat.  I've tried this place 3 times now, trying to give it a fair chance, but I just don't have anything nice to say about it.  They obviously aren't familiar with cooking Mexican cuisine because I got no hints of herbs and spices typically used.  Everything is over-salted to make up for the bland food.  I walked away each time with a throbbing headache from the mass amounts of salt I consumed.  I think that because this place is sandwiched within the Biltmore shopping center, people think the place is good.  But trust me, you're better off saving your money and finding somewhere better to eat."}
{"text":"Recommend this place because of their service, food, and drinks. Everything was delicious. Ordered the cheese crisp with guacamole and my boyfriend ordered the quesadilla and enchiladas. Everything came out to a good price including the drinks. Worth the $70. Enchiladas were the best I have ever tried besides the ones we make at home (:"}
{"text":"Wow!! On a quick trip to PHX stopped in this place because I liked the name. Happy hour is the time to come because the margaritas are $5 and the happy hour menu is discounted. I walked away very full and happy!! Spices are just right and the staff very friendly and helpful. This is a no brainier, if you are here, stop in. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Feeling as though 90 minutes on a Saturday is an excessive wait time for food service regardless of the size of the party.   Nothing particularly special about this place."}
{"text":"To me, Blanco was just fair Mexican food, with a tiny bit of inspiration, however they try to pass it off as if this restaurant is the greatest thing since the scoop chip.  First things first, they have a michelada on their drink menu, but don't order it!  Even if you've had wonderful micheladas in the past, Blanco's is terrible, with WAY TOO MUCH worchester sauce and not enough lime...yucky!    The chips and salsa were actually really good, as well as the guacamole.  I had the ahi tacos, which were overseasoned, presumably to cover up the not-so-fresh taste of the fish.  My wife had a veggie burrito, which was huge in size, but not in taste.  The rice they serve with the dishes is to, die, for!  Next time I visit, if ever again, I am ordering just a bowl of the buttered rice...delicious.   The service at this restaurant was borderline terrible, from needing to ask for everything, including more chips and water refills, to waiting too long for food, which then came out on an extremely hot plate, as if it had been sitting under a window for far too long!  And again Blanco, why the attitude? The food is not that great, your servers aren't that hot and your drinks are weak, get over yourselves."}
{"text":"You should REALLY reconsider the tortillas you serve.  The harina are usually undercooked and the corn ate really thick, sometimes cold, and stiff.  But, the good news is your drinks are ridiculously good.  So, congratulations on that!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing margaritas! The server was so accommodating and kind. Best Mexican food in the valley by far! Fresh produce amazing hands down!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for late night drinks and tacos. If you come during the day you can get single tacos to go out their side order window. Prices are in the mid range and the ambiance is casual-modern. They have a full bar with four televisions and plenty of indoor and patio seating. The bar's roll up window merges the patio and bar for an open ambiance. Come on a Friday night, you'll get right in and they'll treat you right."}
{"text":"We selected this restaurant based on the recommendation of a relative. It is an upscale restaurant featuring Tex-Mex items. We had drinks. I had a spicy Margarita that I liked and a Chimichanga. It was also good. Although the ambiance was nice, I didn't think the drinks and food were substantively different from other Tex-Mex restaurants."}
{"text":"I agree, pretty good. Had the salad with chicken which was very flavorful, the chips and salsa really good and my father had the fish tacos with black beans and rice--they were really good, too. I ordered to go and I did have to wait a couple minutes at the bar to get someone's attention to ring up my order, but they were busy so NBD. Cute place, valet parking right out front. I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"I are here last week for lunch and thought it was excellent. I had the chicken mole and guacamole side. Really enjoyed the regional take on the mole and the guacamole was really really good. Service was excellent. Can't think of a single reason to rate this down."}
{"text":"Tried to eat here without a reservation with a group of 8 today. Was told everything here was completely booked. They did try and help us find another restaurant but disappointed the best option always at the bar. Appreciate the kindness of the managers but really a group of 8 can't be seated at 5:15 pm?"}
{"text":"Love this resturtant, the food, customer service and ambiance has never let me down. Also an excellent place to hold private parties or events downstairs."}
{"text":"We tried this place on Valentine's Day and they got us in a 20 min  however we were wondering why not sooner because of so many empty tables. Really? On Valentine's Day, they wouldn't have staffed extra? Our server was ok but could she seemed new. We had the crab and shrimp ceviche and it was ok. It seemed fresh but I would have appreciated if it was diced more. Really hard to eat giant pieces of vegetables with chips and there wasn't a lot of shrimp in it either. We had the fish tacos and carne asado burrito. Both were ok but our food took a long time. Everybody kept saying food was on the way but still took time and my beans were cool when we got everything.  On the positive side, the ambience is nice, open and airy. The music was at a tolerable level when we came in but towards the end, the volume had been raised such that I couldn't hear my husband across the table.  Not sure if I will be back. I can think of other places I like better."}
{"text":"Food is always good, but there were a ton of flies, which made the dining experience poor."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and holy moly, one of my favorite Mexican restaurants for sure. First time I went, there was supposed to be a 45 minute wait, it was very busy, but we were seated much faster than that. The staff was friendly both times I went. Great service.  The food was great, the chips and salsa are tasty, but the margaritas and tacos..oh my goodness. I went for happy hour, which includes half off margaritas, and I think these win as my favorite margaritas. I had the white peach and hibiscus, and have also tried the pomagranate/grapefruit. My boyfriend has tried the blood orange and mango jalepeno and enjoyed them as well. As a vegetarian it is always nice to see a veggie taco on the menu. The ingredients taste fresh and the tacos were very flavorful. I always leave very full and satisfied!  Surprised this place only has three and a half stars, it deserves five in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Not too bad but not great either.  The service was prompt and friendly. Atmosphere is nice and it's nice to have outdoor dining option when the weather is nice.   The food was ok. I had the chip the shrimp street tacos. Flavorful but have had better street tacos.   Black beans were ok but not they flavorful. The rice was too buttery tasting for me and not very Mexican in flavor."}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant in the Borgata, typical trendy decor that the Fox restaurants have going for them.  My girlfriend and I met up for margs and lunch on a Saturday, it was busy but we were able to get a table right away.    Our server was slow and not very friendly.  I had the cucumber and kumquat margarita with shrimp tacos.  The margarita was far better than the tacos - they were just normal shrimp tacos.  My friend got a cheese crisp which looked amazing and I would highly recommend that dish to anyone."}
{"text":"Hostesses seemed bothered we interrupted their conversation to find a table (same reaction several times... we were staying next door on business). Other than that, really enjoyed the service. Servers were always friendly, and the food was consistently good. Tried the short rib burrito,  carne asada burrito, Chipotle shrimp, street corn. Enjoyed all of the above. Would come back."}
{"text":"Pretty good but different presentation and composition compared to usual Tex Mex.  My enchiladas were a bit weird, being served in a cast iron fry skillet. Way juicy, but not that much meat. My wife's taco combo was good.  Drinks ok. Prices a tad high"}
{"text":"I was here recently here for our company holiday party and everything about that night was great! Their margaritas are delicious & they don't skimp out on the tequila! Their chicken tacos were my fave (only because I'm not big on red meat) but my bf kept raving about their carne asada tacos. Also, their street corn is a MUST!  The ambiance was fun, hip and clean. Even though our food was set up as a buffet style, they still had servers all over accommodating to us and making sure our drinks were always full.   I will be back for sure and more then likely will try the Biltmore location as it's much closer to us."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in a long time! Fish tacos were fantastic, margaritas were delicious, guacamole was just how I like it - a lot of avocado & not a lot of tomatoes! It is very busy, but you can call ahead & get your name on the wait list."}
{"text":"My husband enjoy all the restaurants in Fox Restaurants brand. We went in for drinks and munchies. Bartender Krystal was great!!! Made great suggestions and I enjoyed what she made!! I had the sangria mixed and it was perfect! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. Very salty. We ordered cheese crisps, gauc and queso fundido for appys. Was ok, but nothing exceptional. Had carnitos tacos and hubby had enchiladas. Was ok. Not bad at all but not amazing.  Service was brutal. 20 min to get a table. Over 45 minutes to get tacos after appys. Meal took 90 minutes. Our kids were going nuts and ate taco chips for dinner because they were hungry. Drinks not served on trays. A server carried four drinks over in his hands. Weird. No cutlery in table, had to ask. Server checked on us serval times saying our food was coming repeatedly. My eight year old said \"it only takes me about thirty seconds to make a TACO, what's wrong with these people?\" Wish it was still Ling and Louie's. We won't come back. There's way better places to eat in Biltmore."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the actual location, but I have to say they had the BEST tacos today at the AZ Taco Festival.  I tried 5 different tacos from various restaurants and Blanco's short rib tacos were the best of the fest by far: juicy, succulent beef on a warm, fresh corn tortilla with a spicy salsa and a little squiggle of cream = YUM. The girls serving the tacos were very nice too and I got a little card for free guac - bonus!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location since it opened and always enjoyed the food, atmosphere and waiters. I have to say though, tonight was far better than any visit maybe even at any restaurant. They have certainly stepped up their game. Food was quick and delicious, our waiter was friendly and helpful, and everyone seemed like they genuinely liked being there. Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"It's a good concept and some of the food is OK. The carne asada was chewy, the carnitas tacos had no flavor. The queso fundido was great but the corn tortillas are pretty bad.  The place and the service are pretty good but if you're going there for authentic tacos, this is not the place."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Can't get better Han a $6 marg for happy hour. Unlimited chips and sals. Tacos were great. The churros were fab."}
{"text":"The staff is always incredible!  The chicken is awesome. A fun casual place to hang out with friends.  Not necessarily a good business restaurant due to a fun outgoing atmosphere often leads to noise but a great place to chill with friends for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Average place, average food.  I was with a group that was craving Mexican Food, but I wasn't particularly in the mood, so I had the burger and fries,which i know it's a little odd for a Mexican Restaurant, but i put a twist to by adding jalape√±o peppers and the chipotle mayo.  It was far from being a bad burger, but it was nothing special either.  The fries were a little undercooked.  The servers were nice and the food came at the expected time.  I would eat there again, it definitely wasn't a bad experience."}
{"text":"Visiting the Biltmore from San Diego where there is little to no good Mexican food, my expectations were high. Blanco met those expectations. Fantastic happy hour and great tacos! Also Gabe was our server and he was great too."}
{"text":"Pineapple margarita is awesome, along with the chips and salsa!! The fish tacos were excellent!  Call ahead, it gets BUSY! Because of the busyness, service was a little slow, not bad!! Overall amazing time!!"}
{"text":"This is another Fox Restaurant Concept and they've once again created a unique and innovated culinary experience based on a timeless classic. I love Mexican food and Blanco has taken it to another level. They have a large menu with enough selection and diversity to satisfy anyone. My favorite item on the menu are the Ahi Tuna tacos, they are simply spectacular. Nothing better than a few tacos and a corona after a long day of work. My only issue with this restaurant is the service. For some reason the staff is less attentive here than at other Fox Restaurants. I've been here 5 of 6 times and the service is always so-so. The food more than makes up for it though."}
{"text":"I met a business contact here for lunch - it was delicious. We both had the street tacos on corn tortillas, each with a different filling. I had roasted chicken, pulled pork, and fish. They came with beans and rice. The rice was creamy and the beans were well cooked too.   My only quibble with my experience is I don't like raw tomatoes and I purposely selected tacos that didn't have tomatoes on them, but 2 of my 3 tacos had diced tomato on them that I had to pick off. Next time I'll tell the server \"No raw tomatoes anywhere on the plate, please\" regardless of what the menu says."}
{"text":"4.25. Upon landing in Phoenix we came straight to Blanco Tacos for lunch! It held up to all the hype.   Great location at the Biltmore Fashion Park!   Atmosphere and vibes are super!  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.   Drinks and food came quickly.   Chips and salsa are addictive!   My ros√© was perfect and the hubs liked his IPA.   We shared the combo fajita platter with carne asada and chicken with corn tortillas.   Everything was amazing. I ate the beef and chicken by themselves towards the end and they were so well marinated.   Wow! You won't go wrong here. And the decor is on point too!"}
{"text":"Another great find in town. Ambiance and wait staff were nice. The chicken tacos were yummy.  Lauryn was our server and she provided us great customer service. Definitely a place to go out with friends or family. Love the outdoor seating. Only recommendation would be to change the music selection. It didn't match the feel or ambiance of the restaurant and could be an easy change."}
{"text":"A couple days ago, I flew in from Denver and was staying at hotel near the Biltmore. Ended up finding a tequila bar called blanco that had sweet happy hour deals so we decided to go in to have margaritas. Our server was Jordyn, totally made the whole experience worth the stop. Highly recommended... they were super cool!"}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoyed celebrating Cinco de Mayo here.  We were able to score a nice table in the middle of the bar.  The Coronas and margaritas were great.  We had the chicken and beef soft tacos and gotta say, they were both good.  Love the open floor plan.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Everyone needs a few places that they can rely on for good takeout when family or friends are over but no one wants to go out. Blanco is now at the top of the list for us after using them this past weekend.   We purchased the BBQ tacos, Shrimp tacos, Beef Enchilada, and Salmon and everyone thought their meal was delicious. The take out containers are portioned so things don't become a jumbled mess inside. As a bonus, we had two big bags of chips included and a jug of salsa which we weren't not expecting.  One major note was that my tacos were not unbearably soggy by the time I ate them which I was surprised by considering they had to be sitting in there for 20-30 minutes by the time I was digging into them. Very yummy.  I also tried the salmon and they do a really nice job."}
{"text":"So my lady and I recently went to Blanco's on a Sunday night we are very picky when it comes to Service as we both work in hospitality and Old Town Scottsdale let me tell you something this place is a blast this service is awesome the food is perfect five stars top-notch all the way this place is impeccable and I would definitely recommend to anybody that is in the Scottsdale area to check out I would rate this six stars if possible hands down our server was named Bree and she was awesome go check out this establishment and ask for Bri"}
{"text":"The Mexican corn is amazing here, just like the little corn stands... The sangria is so good and its inexpensive. Great find definitely eat here and the servers are attentive."}
{"text":"food? 8 out of 10.  good chips.  ambience? weird, at bar, as view of other people across bar is blocked. odd design.  service?  hate to say it, but as disinterested as one could imagine. off-day, perhaps?  Love the advertising billboards for Blanco )more savvy Sam Fox marketing at work).  But this place is in serious need of a pulse."}
{"text":"I ordered food from Blanco on Postmates yesterday.   When it arrived, more than half the order was wrong, so I called and spoke with Nate Dietrich who is the General Manager. He empathized with me, mentioned they are working with Postmates to correct some mistakes on their menu, and had the kitchen remake the items that were incorrect. He then DROVE THE FOOD TO MY HOUSE as a courtesy. I know this review isn't about the food or restaurant in particular, but I think service is one of the most important parts of a successful Restaurant. Clearly Sam Fox feels the same way. Nate exceeded my expectations, and offered a great example on how to take care of people. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Solid place, needs to smooth out rough edges. What I mean by that is the wait staff and the blonde woman bartender. But over all, solid guacamole, good food so a must try and see for yourself.   The atmosphere is trendy/rustic Mexican feel. With a few tv's in the building. A patio for fun in the sun with friends or your pootches."}
{"text":"Loved it. The food was delicious and the service was excellent I ordered the chipotle shrimp tacos yummy. I also had the blood orange margarita and it was tasty as well. Great chips and salsa. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Jake Gyllenhaal looking' bartender made me a  drink that was $12 #Annoyed. Food was decent but after he talked me out of buying a $5 beer he made my friend and I pay $24 for two drinks. I would've rather had the $5 beer."}
{"text":"Yuppy interior decorator meets mexican food = Blanco.  The food was so-so, the cheese crisp was good, the people watching was the best part.  If your a single male looking for another male and you can stomach bland over frooffy food, this is your place.  I guess I just hoped for something better from the Borgata area, even the now closed El torito next door was way better.    You will find me getting real mexican food somewhere else."}
{"text":"The best Spanish food and margaritas I have ever had! The atmosphere is very fun, reasonable prices, creative flare of Spanish dishes that are to die for. I had the cheese crisps (large Mexican pizza) and want to go back already! The service and staff are just the lime on the perfect margarita to a fabulous dining experience!"}
{"text":"I come here about once every two weeks after work and grab one of their tables outside.  I love their chips and salsa - and their happy hour prices are reasonable.  I always get the cheese quesadilla (which is marked down for happy hour)  and it never disappoints.  The service is always excellent and the establishment is very clean.  It's a great place whether you are dining alone or with a group."}
{"text":"i'm not sure why this place doesn't have a higher rating. I tried this the other weekend for the first time and it was amazing!  Tried: Classic Margarita it was delicious  Queso Chorizo appetizer: another delicious dish  but my absolute favorite thing was the cheese enchilada that I got for my main course.  They bring it out in a mini cast iron pan and instead of rolled enchiladas it was like an enchilada pie and it was sooo amazing I dont even think I swallowed one bite I basically just inhaled it!  Only complaint is that they do NOT take reservations unless you have a party of 8 or more :( seriously?! so either get their early or go late if you want to get in and out. Otherwise expect a wait and have a drink or two at the bar while you wait"}
{"text":"Blanco is A-OK. I've been here twice recently and I'd say my experience was average both times.   The first time my team (a group of about 16 people) enjoyed dinner on the patio. Blanco's staff did a pretty good job with the service. We ordered a number of sides of queso (because cheese), and there was a hair in one of them. So that's not great.   The second time I came in for lunch with a friend, and while the service left something to be desired, we did enjoy our grilled mahi fish tacos and the rice alongside it, which must be filled with butter because it was so good.   Overall, I'll probably be back because Blanco is a popular restaurant with my friends and the food is pretty good, but I probably wouldn't come here on my own because the service wasn't great, and that hair...."}
{"text":"We love the tacos at Blanco.  I agree the prices are high for what you get but they have such great choices and the ability to order a mix of tacos is nice.   And the street corn!!!!   It is fantastic!    If the prices are a turn off, go during happy hour.  The last time we went, we  got there right at the end of Happy Hour and the prices and choices were surprisingly good.    The restaurant is a little loud but it is bright,  airy and has a fun vibe."}
{"text":"I finally tried Blanco last Tuesday night... there were 4 in our party; not enough to make a reservation.  Luckily, when we arrived around 7:15 pm, we didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes to get seated.  And we must've lucked out, because our service was prompt and attentive.  The guacamole is a perfect appetizer to share... and the chips and salsa are worth the splurge.  I shared a Caesar Salad to start, and that was quite tasty as well.  I was debating what to order for the main course and when I asked the waitress about the salmon she said she didn't eat seafood but that she's been told the salmon is 'buttery.'  Buttery salmon?  Really?  That didn't sell me on ordering the salmon, but it was what I went with after all.  And although I would not describe it as buttery, I will say it was good.  It was a generous serving as well, so I didn't mind when Jared started eating it off my plate.  The rice with veggies that it was served with was also tasty.  Overall, Blanco didn't blow me away, but I am sure I'll return sometime.  You can't go wrong popping in for a drink or two and some chips, salsa, and guac in a trendy atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place could have been great, but I noticed too many flaws while eating here. It takes a great deal to make me actually go on Yelp to complain about a restaurant. First off, it was a quiet Sunday night, on April 24th and we had a party of 7. We were told that they were setting up and \"cleaning\" a table for us. When we were taken to our table it was still dirty, there was a puddle of spilt water on the floor, and chunks of food on the floor that my boyfriend had to step on in order to get to his seat. I was shocked because this restaurant should be of higher class.   Next was the dining experience. We had a female waitress that only made dining at this restaurant even more awkward. She took our drink orders and made me feel judged and belittled for only drinking water and not purchasing an alcoholic beverage on a Sunday night. Next, when I received my order of chipotle shrimp tacos, I immediately noticed that the avocado was bruised and black in some places. Again, I'm spending a decent amount of money for this food. I would expect bruised avocado from filibertos, not this place. I was EXTREMELY disappointed. The waitstaff barely checked on us and almost seemed that because we were in a group that didn't purchase what they preferred, that we didn't matter.   All around, I'm disappointed that this restaurant is considered the same caliber as other Fox restaurants I ate ate North Italia in Kierland earlier that day and had a wonderful experience. I would not go back to Blancos after the experience I had."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and the staff is friendly. I do think the food is overpriced for the quality that you receive. Great food just not worth the money."}
{"text":"This place deserves all the stars.  Food: AMAZING Try the pork tacos mmmm mm mmmm Drinks: AMAZING The mojitos are excellent Service:  Really good  Wait times on a Fri, Sat night...not so good but worth it!!!  Love Love love this place."}
{"text":"After trying this at the AZ Taco Festival, we had to try the real deal This was my favorite at the Taco Festival and after trying the full experience, I am sold! I love a restaurant that is built to be outdoors. It was nice sitting right by the huge garage doors.  We were outside yet not.. The margaritas are good? The queso fundido was yum! And the chipotle fish tacos... omg... I seriously took another order of them to go and dug into it when we got home  If you want tequila and a table food of awesome tacos, this is the place"}
{"text":"Great food, Great drinks, Great Brunching.   I was pleasantly surprised when the business owner Nate reached out to me to inquire about my first visit. My second visit did not disappoint. The margaritas were delicious and so was their food. I think this is becoming my new after hike brunch spot. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, I get something different. Each time the food has been amazing. My favorite menu item I have ordered in the past has been the braised short ribs & avocado cheese crisps. Traditionally made on flour tortillas, I am unable to eat wheat. The waiter was more than happy to request the kitchen use corn tortillas instead of flour to accommodate my gluten allergy. Will keep coming back here."}
{"text":"Delish but please tell me if you're using lard or some animal products... I was so sick after!   Don't look at the pretentious customers."}
{"text":"We were visiting the Scottsdale area from San Diego and decided to go to Blanco for our Mexican Food fix. Blanco did not disappoint!!  For appetizers, we order the Queso dip. Wow!! One of the best queso dips I've ever had. The chips and salsa they serve to start off are also good and not overly salty.  I order the Carne Asada Burrito for my meal and my girlfriend ordered their Chicken Fajitas. The burrito was great although next time I'll make sure I get it enchilada style. My girlfriend also really enjoyed her chicken fajitas.   When we initially arrived, we were told that t would be a 45 minute wait but we were seated after a 20 minute wait. The service from our waiter was also great and they always made sure to check in with us and refill our waters  During my visit, I found out that they were opening their first location in San Diego this year! I will definitely make sure to visit once their location opens up here. Looking forward to it!!"}
{"text":"I got to say this is probably the most accurate 3 star overall rating I've seen on Yelp in some time. I'm proud of you Phoenicians! This place was simply meh, especially given the huge amount of delicious mexican food places in AZ where you can get a kick ass margarita for a whole lot less than $10. We ordered a couple drinks and were disappointed with all of them; consensus was that they were all too sweet and not enough tequila, the sangria tasted like juice for peets sake. The chips are a nice thicker version however the salsa is thin and flavorless. Roast those tomatoes or something, throw in some heat! Their guacamole, although a decent flavor profile, needed a lot more lime and was super blended to the texture of those nasty avocado 'dips' you find next to french onion and ranch plastic containers. We all ordered tacos of various types for dinner, I had the roasted veggie ones with a hard shell. Man these were no good. The veggies were really oily from their saute and were used sparingly; the bottom of the tacos was cabbage. Honestly, the only good thing I ate tonight was the black beans, abet a bit salty. I will say our server was very friendly however the food just don't hold water to the prices. Try Tia Rosas in Mesa for some excellent mexican food and margaritas worth their $8 and more in tequila."}
{"text":"MUST TRY!!! Went in for a friends birthday birthday dinner. They accept reservations for our large party.   It's a nice big restaurant with modern decor and an open kitchen. The bathrooms are located down stairs as well as a separate party room and bar that would be great to rent out for a party.   We got there a little before 6pm to catch happy hour and got half price margaritas. The group got a mix of about every margaritas and all we're really smooth and tasty. The original had a little OJ in it which made it refreshing and I got the mixed berry which was great.   The server had let us know that they make all ingredients in house with fresh ingredients so they can easily accommodate any allergies. Once we received our food I could tell each item had that fresh taste and so much flavor! The chips were warm and they serve them with 3 Salas's: mild green, house medium, and a habanero which I didn't think it was hot but it had that good roasted flavor. The green salsa was my favorite though!   For our meal we went with the 3 taco combos that you can mix and match! I got the green chilli pork and carnitas tacos with rice and sub beans for Mexican street corn ($2 upcharge). My husband got the carne asada tacos. They have fresh made corn or flour tortillas. All the tacos were super amazing! So much flavor and perfect size. We added a little corn and rice to the taco and made it packed full of flavor. My favorite was definitely the green chilli pork, very juicy! And don't get me started with that Mexican street corn.... TO DIE FOR!!!!   Overall everything was amazing! The service was great and very prompt. They even give you a free dessert on your birthday! Our friend choose this chocolate cake that was very rich but tasty and perfect to share. The food was incredible and packed full of flavor. You could taste the freshness of every ingredient. I can't wait to come back and take new friends and family. I highly highly recommend!!! Thank you Blanco Taco! (:"}
{"text":"I work in the Biltmore and get the nachos from the Blanco Rapido counter almost every day on my break! So amazing"}
{"text":"We come here very often and it's always a great experience. We can reserve seats through Open Table, which has been very convenient. The wait staff has been consistently amazing. The food has been incredible.   Here's our favorites: Classic margaritas - basic but so good. Queso dip  Street corn Carne asada fajitas  Honestly there hasn't been a dish we haven't liked.   My wife has informed me this is where you can find us if you need us this summer"}
{"text":"The last time I was in Phoenix, I decided to try out Blancos Tacos + Tequila for a solo lunch. I was doing a little shopping in the area and staying close by at the Embassy.   One thing that I loved about BT+T was the Micheladas and Shandies. For my first, I ordered the Oaxacan Shandy with Jose Cuervo Tradicional, Solerno, Pineapple, Cilantro, Tecate Lager. With that I had a small order of Warm Queso Blanco dip with Chips for $3; pretty good and inexpensive.   To eat, I tried to pick something small but the fish taco plate was quite filling. It was only $14 for three tacos with rice and beans. The rice was a little bland, but everything else was great. With that, I tried the Grapefruit Elderflower Shady with Belvedere Grapefruit, Elderflower, Fresh Grapefruit and Modelo Especial.   I'll be back the next time I'm in town, it was a good time even for a solo lunch. Great refreshing Shandies and appetizers."}
{"text":"Where do I start. Blanco tacos happy hour was exceptional. The chicken tacos were sensational. Those shrimp Po boy sandwiches......WOW! The bartender kept our shot glasses full. The drinks were top notch. I recommend any and everyone to check  out Blanco Tacos  for hip happening music and a really enjoy the great Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"This place surprised me. Thought it was just another mall chain place but it's actually really good. Ordered the Mahi fajita and it was really good. Margaritas are ok, service is good, food is delicious. Great stop when shopping. I had a jerk seating next to me and the bartender handled him extremely well. Kudos to her!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour until 6pm on a Saturday?! Yes, this place is amazing. I was thoroughly impressed by the happy hour prices and selection. The chips and dip on happy hour was by far the best value for the money and so delicious. Loved the atmosphere- trendy and classy but not fancy and definitely not a party restaurant. Entrees were good but not amazing or particularly special. But shout out to our awesome waiter Fletcher. You were incredible. Very attentive, down to earth and nice. One of the best waiters I have ever encountered."}
{"text":"Another hip Scottsdale restaurant...cool, but not charming.   I liked this place, but it's hard for me to LOVE something that almost seems like an upscale chain restaurant. The setting of the place definitely has some cool decor, but some of the people who frequent the restaurant are fairly lame.   The Black and Blue Mojito is delicious; fruit, rum, and mint? Yes please! I hate paying $10 for a drink, but this one almost makes it worth it. During my most recent trip to Blanco I ordered the chicken fajitas. They came out looking much different than I expected. The peppers, onions, chicken, pico, and sour cream were already all together in the skillet, which was different, but still good. They had a bit of spiciness which I liked. I asked for a small side of shredded cheese to add because cheese makes everything better. The fajitas came with four mini flour tortillas (I could have had corn) which tasted great and made for some cute little tacos. I also liked their chips and salsa that came immediately upon sitting down. Being a salt-lover, I was thrilled that the chips were already salted. The salsa was a bit spicy, but I'm a big baby when it comes to zesty flavors.   My server was very attentive. He didn't stay around to chat, but he was constantly checking up on us to make sure my boyfriend's water glass was full. The manager was also walking around to check on tables, which I always appreciate.   Blanco isn't a restaurant that I would frequent, but I did enjoy my visit. 3 stars seems appropriate for a place that is classy and well done, but doesn't blow me away or make me anticipate my next meal there. I'm sure I'll return eventually."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place. Their food is amazing. Their salsa is amazing. I highly recommend the tacos. You can mix and match different kinds. Their margaritas are delicious too! Try the blood orange. Amazing."}
{"text":"This was my second time after a few years and the homemade salsa is a hit ! Just enough kick with bursting flavors. Love the black beans and it's flavors ! The rice is delicious ! Finally the braised shredded beef burrito hand down the tastiest burrito I have ever eaten and any establishment !"}
{"text":"Usually a fan of Blanco, but the last time I went there they put our name and number in the system (we verified the number)  so they could text us when our table was ready. They told us the wait would be 15 minutes which was a stretch as we got there at 5:30 hoping to get happy hour prices before it ends at 6. We ended up waiting until 6 and when there was still no sign of us getting called anytime soon, we decided to leave. To this day we still never received a text from them saying our reservation was ready. Also I'm not sure if the valet is officially affiliated with the restaurant but I valeted my car to come back and find that they just parked it on the sidewalk next to the restaurant and left the car unlocked with the key sitting in the drivers seat!!!! This is unacceptable. I have attached pictures of food that I have eaten here in the past. If you're going to go there I would say only their happy hour is really worth it considering a lot happy hour food isn't on the main menu. But after this I probably won't be coming back to Blanco anytime soon."}
{"text":"Blanco is clean, airy, fun, and has excellent ventilation. The food and waitstaff are also very good. There is patio seating and a huge bar. Music is not too loud. You can actually converse without shouting at each other. Tons of free parking."}
{"text":"Good tacos, great guac! Michelada was not so great. Would go back for guac for sure! Service was pretty good but lagged at times. I would definitely recommend the short rib tacos and pulled pork tacos."}
{"text":"The classic margarita is spot on if you like a tart margarita! They make their own house sour which is a bonus. Happy hour prices are perfect to quench your thirst with little appetizers to fill your tummy! The chocolate on the churros is nice as well if you like dark chocolate. The only very disappointing factor is if you want to enjoy the tables outside of the bar, there is no table service. A bit odd when you pay all this money for quality food. Would be nice to have table service to make dinner/drinks a more relaxing environment."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**  Came here for a work event, so our menu was preset. They have a separate dining room downstairs for private events equipped with AV equipment (microphone and projector. You would need to bring your own laptop). There is also a bar in the dining room. Service was fantastic and very attentive. I would recommend this place for any  Drinks: Pomegranate Margarita  Sooo good!! They have a variety of unique mixes on the menu including a Mango Jalapeno!   Appetizer: Chips and Salsa, Guacamole, and Mexican Street Corn The corn was fantastic! Probably one of my favorites in the valley.  Entr√©e: Roasted Mushroom Tacos I'm usually not a fan of \"roasted\" items, but I really enjoyed these tacos! Unfortunately no option of hard tacos - only soft. Extra bonus points because the meal comes specifically with vegetarian black beans!   Dessert: Brown Sugar Caramel Flan Not many people enjoy flan because of the consistency, but this was perfect! Not too creamy or mushy. Come topped with a delicious homemade cinnamon whip cream.  Needless to say i was STUFFED by dessert. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went on recommendations from Yelp for lunch. Started out with warm, perfectly salted chips and not too spicy salsa.  Sampled the fish taco, bbq pork and carnitas taco.  All were very good but carnitas were my favorite!  The rice wasn't dry and had been seasoned nicely. I wasn't a great fan of the beans ( not enough flavor for me).  My server was very sweet, prompt, and lovely.  It's a little pricey for every day lunch, but I could imagine it would be nice as a special treat with work colleagues!"}
{"text":"I had been to the other Blanco location a few years ago, but we only had drinks and apps.  This time I had the chipotle shrimp tacos and they were A-MAZ-ING!  Can't wait to get back there and have them again."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food....just the chips, salsa and guac.  All very good I thought.  Great margaritas too!  Sat on the front patio...the lounge patio.  It was nice and comfy, but the cushions on the chairs were pretty dirty and stained.  I'd like to go back and  try the food next time!"}
{"text":"I come in here at least twice a month. I decided it was time to write a review. The two servers that constantly stand out prominently to me are Andrew and Drew. They both always have gone above and beyond for me service wise. They are always friendly and efficient, going out of their way to make sure my visit is outstanding. The Mexican faire and handmade drinks are outstanding for a Sam Fox location. However, what really brings me back here is the service, and which always shines brightly. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Crispy shrimp tacos are amazing.  They have a great patio with heaters and fire pits. Great place for a business lunch at a good price.  Fresh chips and salsa are a nice touch since this is more of an upscale Mexican place.  Plenty of tequila options too."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great service. Nice breeze even though we were sitting inside. Pricy, of course !"}
{"text":"Not at all impressed. Carne asada was dry. Fish was fishy. Flavors were just average. Wont be back. The one star is for the waitress."}
{"text":"Ambience is cool and food is good. Margarita's are terrible! I don't like to send anything back but every time we've dined we had to exchange the maggie's for something else. I will say that I am pretty picky about my margarita's, but expect a Mexican restaurant with tequila in the name to deliver."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is where it's at!! My friend and I saw this place at Biltmore Plaza & decided to try it out. We came right on time for Happy Hour & we got Nachos which we're only $3.50!! Very good for an afternoon snack & just to hangout with friends."}
{"text":"More like Bland-co.  I found myself being pulled towards the seared ahi tacos, but upon arrival they really didn't have much going on.  I would have liked to see some sauce on them or something.  The rice served with it wasn't even Spanish rice, and wtf is up shredded carrots as a side.  Blah!  The highlight of the evening was definitely the white peach margarita - OUTSTANDING and one of the best drinks I've ever had.  However, seemed a little light on the tequila.  After chugging 2 of them on an empty stomach, I would have expected Mr. Buzz to pay me a nice visit.  Instead, I got his niece."}
{"text":"It is never a good sign when all the surrounding restaurants have a 30-45 min wait and immediate sitting is available at Blanco.... This was my husband and my first time eating here. We enjoy all the other Fox Restaurants and were unfortunately very disappointed with the food and experience. The immediate seating on their beautiful patio was pretty much the only good part of our meal. Street tacos were decent but very overpriced for what you get. The black beans had a very funny after taste and the rice was covered in a cream like sauce. It was almost like a risotto, but lacking a lot of flavor. My husband's burrito was okay...but surprisingly small, really small. We also had to wait 25 minutes to get our appetizer Shrimp and Crab Ceviche which was pretty good but a very loose interpretation on a ceviche.  The waitress and hostess made a big deal about pointing out how Blanco is a \"modern\" take on Mexican cuisine. We are always up for trying a new approach to classic favorites, but if you are going to depart that far off you need make sure you execute the flavors. Fox Restaurants hasn't figured this out yet. at Blanco..."}
{"text":"My lunch at Blanco had its ups and downs. My aunt and I met at the mall for lunch here and I was so excited for Mexican food! It was a good crowd for a weekday lunch but they earned some points for accommodating our request for a booth.   They brought us chips and salsa right away, which is always excellent. Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication with our guacamole order, so it came out about 20 minutes after we ordered and about 5 minutes before our lunch entrees were delivered. I was disappointed with the guacamole; it had very little flavor and could have benefited from a healthy dose of salt and lots more cilantro. My meal, though, was excellent. I got the green poblano pork burrito, which had the most tender, moist, and flavorful pork I have ever had. There wasn't much else in the burrito, but that was fine with me. Yes, as another reviewer pointed out, the main flavor of the rice is butter, but it is abated nicely when eaten with the black beans on the side.  The food was inconsistent and the service was only ok. I would probably try another restaurant at this mall before repeating at Blanco, but I would definitely order that pork burrito from there again!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco spot in the valley! If you're looking for traditional Mexican fare you may want to look elsewhere, but if your down to try something different this is the place to go. I've been here 3 times, each time I've gotten the 3 taco platter with 3 different tacos. So far every taco I've tried has been great. Be sure to order the pulled pork taco (my favorite) and a side of the street corn (to die for)."}
{"text":"So when I heard my brother's friends birthday would be here, I was a little skeptical. First, I had never heard of it and second I started to research it on Yelp. I was apprehensive after reading the reviews and was worried I would be wasting my money on sub-par food. Well after going, it was not horrible, but not a life changing experience either.   I was saddened when i found out it had replaced Tanneko. I actually liked that place. We had reservations because we were a big party, so we didn't wait long. There were, however, quite a few people waiting for a while after we sat down. It was your typical north Scottsdale crowd. Every woman looked the same and every guy looked like a DB.   The food. I enjoyed the chips and salsa. It's hard to mess up. Had a couple of Dos Equis which they had on tap. They came out promptly and cold. I ordered the Carnitas tacos. They came with rice and beans. There were two tacos and you have a choice of tortilla. They were pretty good. Again, nothing spectacular. The black beans I had were good, but the rice was just like buttered white rice that someone mentioned in a previous review. My brother had the machaca burrito which was huge and he seemed to enjoy.   A couple of funny anecdotes. I think we had runners bring food for other tables to ours about 3 times. They seemed a little lost all night. Later on when the right food came, my brother asked the runner which of the two identical burritos was chicken and which was beef. The runner said, and I quote, \"Dude, they just give me the food and tell me where to take it.\" No effing joke!   Overall, you could probably skip this place and come back when it changes to some other ethnic-type food place in a year."}
{"text":"Mexican street corn is awesome! Carne asada tacos are very good but after I ordered I learned you can mix/match the tacos which is great. Had lunch there and was fast and bartender was great."}
{"text":"Such a Disappointment! I love Fox Restaurants so I was uber excited to finally check this place out. We started with the Guacamole. It looked amazing but was bland and flavorless. I ordered the ahi tacos and they were \"meh\". Now my guy and I LOVE desserts but were so disappointed with what we had.. why bother hitting a disappointing trifecta? Great decor, great service, boring flavorless food."}
{"text":"Really  good service and friendly  employees. If they mess up your order, they resolve no hassle.  I got the 3 tacos combo and they added an extra side I didn't  order, so they gave it to me and no charge.  They have a nice bar area too."}
{"text":"For being a Rapido window it was horrible. Just came back from ordering food and the people that ordered after me got their order first. It was chaotic when I ordered and the young girl taking my order was more interested in what the manager was doing and her coworkers.   Then I finally went up and saw my food sitting there. The girl told me it was a shift change and to tell her what I ordered. The one that took my order came back, as she was leaving she realize and finished getting my food. Sorry for the inconvenience that I wanted you to finish what you started. The manager there seemed clueless as well. She hurriedly gave it to me. So sad for Sam Fox that he hires young kids with no work ethic.   Not sure I am comfortable telling clients to go there. They expect good service, even for a \"fast\" window."}
{"text":"Food was just OK. Bar area was dirty.  Very nice bartender but too many negatives for me to come back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and here are my final thoughts. Mediocre food. Overpriced. Flavorless fish tacos. Salsas are not very hot. Two stars for Good margaritas and service."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the best Mexican food places in the valley! The Service, atmosphere and endless options for dietary restrictions are awesome! We came here with some friends and we got a variety of different things. Mushroom tacos - they were very tasty! I love this vegan option. (Ask for no cheese)  Guacamole cheese crisp - our friend got this as her meal! It looked amazing and she raved about it the entire dinner. She said it was very filling!! Guacamole, chips and salsa- when the waiter knew I was dairy free, he asked if we would like the guacamole to be dairy free as well! I was very impressed. It tasted great! The chips and salsa are some of my favorites! So good!! Variety of tacos - the guys got several different types of tacos. Pork, barbecue, shrimp!! They loved them all!!  The rice and beans that come with the taco meal's were so good as well!!!!  Our server was on top of everything! Drinks were never empty, plates were taken away promptly! Manager even stop by to make sure that we were doing good! Hands-down one of my favorite Mexican places to go ever! Can't say it enough"}
{"text":"I was shopping at the Biltmore when I spotted this place. I love the fact they have a pickup window. I ordered the 2 for $6 deal on the street tacos; one chicken, one carnitas. Wow. Soooo good, bursting with flavor. I couldn't decide which taco I loved more. I'm a sucker for a good street taco and they delivered. I'll be tempted to stop here every time I hit the Biltmore. Super yummy."}
{"text":"Blanco always has great food and drinks, service is always quick and food is always amazing! This is our weekly dinner/happy hour spot in the Biltmore and the staff are always amazing!"}
{"text":"We were fans of the Scottsdale location and now we go to the Biltmore Blanco at least once a month... My kids don't eat Mexican but they have burgers and fries in the kids menu so that takes care of that (I know, leave them home, right?). Love, love, LOVE the shrimp cheese crisp with grilled corn to start.  The chips and salsa are perfect because my hubbie and I both enjoy it (rarely do we agree on salsa; this has more of a smoky flavor than spicy). And I've now tried every style of street taco and I love them all so I just close my eyes and choose 3 different ones each visit; they never disappoint.  You can mix it up with sweet, smoky and spicy--all great and not too filling. My only complaint is the somewhat high prices and sometimes slow bar service..."}
{"text":"Great patio and delicious food! Get the traditional carnitas and get ready for a perfect blend of deliciousness to explode in your mouth. Get in my belly."}
{"text":"Had the ceviche which had crab and shrimp.  It was very good.  A slight sweetness to it that made it stand out.  Also had the grilled fish tacos.  It comes with black beans and white rice. Very fresh and tasty. Also tried the flan.  Very creamy with just a slight taste of caramel. Served with sliced strawberries and whipped cream. Delicious. Definitely recommend this place.  It was worth the trip."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our first visit to Blanco last night.  Service was great (he even packed us up some salsa and chips to go!) and the ambiance is nice.  We started with the Crab and Shrimp Ceviche (big chunks of seafood; nice and crisp) and the Shrimp and Corn Cheese Crisp (grilled sweet corn complemented the sharp cheese SO nicely! Yum)  Our main meals were Tacos (Machaca, great flavor! and Roasted Chicken, which was way too salty; only bad note of the night) and we barely finished everything. No room for dessert but we were feeling fat and happy.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I visited this place with my daughter yesterday for lunch around 1 PM.  I was sporting a Nike outfit so definitely not looking professional.  Why am I mentioning this? Read on...  Since we are vegetarians, we asked for substituting meat for black beans and give us gauc for rice since rice has chicken broth.  We mentioned if there's a charge for substitution, let us know.  BTW, this is not uncommon and pretty much all restaurants are used to this type of requests.  The Scottsdale branch is actually very good and the staff there offers vegetarians various options right away.  We chose to go to this branch as it was nearby from where we were yesterday and ignoring one of our friends telling us they didn't have a good service at this location.    Anyway, when the bill arrived, there were charges so we politely asked the waitress about these charges and she said she will be right back.  A few minutes later, her manager showed up and started saying, we don't give anything for free here.  We were in a disbelief as we could not understand what was going on and why he had be humiliate us in front of other guests.  My daughter didn't say a word, but I felt offended.  I asked the manager if he can explain what he was told by the waitress that he had to do this in front of everyone.    Apparently, the message from the waitress to her manager was that we were looking for free stuff!  The worst part, this came from the manager himself!  No wonder this place has pathetic service.  It was insulting.  An ideal manager would have first talked to the customer and provided a simple clarification like, sorry but we charge and that would have been okay.  We almost eat out everyday and definitely know that food is not free!  I had to tell the manager that I have never ever felt so uncomfortable and offended in a restaurant.  The manager didn't do anything to address this.  For our part, we paid the bill in full and even tipped the waitress.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  I guess I did my part by providing the feedback to the manager.  Word of advice for the chain and the manager - please listen to the customer first.  Also, if you judged me based on my clothes and reacted the way you did, shame on you.  Families do not always show up in formal clothes.  Please do not do this to any other customer as they may come there to spend time with their family or discuss business over a good meal.  No matter what the circumstance, people should be treated with respect.  It is not always the food that makes a restaurant memorable, but how the ambiance made a person feel. Overall, I would say I would remember this restaurant for its offensive service and would not recommend it to my coworkers, family, and friends.  UPDATE: I am updating this review based on the follow-up from the manager who actually took time to revert back on the issue and offered a sincere apology with a gift certificate to the chain.  if the issue had not occurred in the first place then I would have given it 5 stars for food and ambiance.  I am also hoping that my next visit to this place leaves me with a better impression."}
{"text":"It's my own fault.....I keep going back and each time my experience is different.   It's close to home and they do have good food, but HELP, WHY do I have to ASK for a plate and a napkin after my food has arrived??  Pay attention servers!"}
{"text":"Delicious spiced mango margarita and the street tacos were amazing. However the street corn was fantastic and I could eat it all day."}
{"text":"I was at Blanco earlier this evening to do some Friday unwinding with co-workers after a VERY long week.  We arrived around 7:45pm--the place was hopping and there was a 45 minute wait for a 6-person table (a good sign on a Friday night).  Luckily, upon asking the hostess about the bar situation, we found out there was open seating with a full food menu on the patio!  We snagged a great spot and surrendered our buzzer.  The patio was fantastic with great people watching and ridiculously comfortable chairs--would be a great place for day drinking.  Overall I dig the atmosphere/music/decor of this place, as well as the people and energy.  We decided it was like Sapporo but in Old Town and with Mexican food.    Our food was decent, I won't crave it but would order the green chile enchiladas again.  The salmon ceviche appetizer was probably the best thing that we ordered all night.  My one drink and one glass of water were also tasty (I asked for more water that never came, and I was not offered a second drink so it was a short night in the fluids department).    Assuming they fix their confusion with the serving situation, I would go back here again for sure."}
{"text":"Some of their servers are really good and others are just alright. Food is amazing though! Especially traditional carnitas!"}
{"text":"The food is decent. I had the house specialty enchilada. The bloody Mary I had was good, but small. The service was terrible. Took what seemed like ages for a refill, and finally had to give our card to another waiter because our server was nowhere to be found. Other tables were having similar problems. We even saw one man and woman going to the server station and filling their own drinks! Won't be back."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of all the Sam Fox restaurants. This one did not disappoint at all their food is delicious and comes out rather quickly as well. Great bar to order some really good margaritas as well."}
{"text":"This is a great place to host a work happy hour or to hang out with friends. The vibe here is awesome and lively if you are looking for somewhere to enjoy a beverage that is a little bit more upbeat. It is a little bit on the pricier side, you also have to pay for parking. Great drink menu and easy restaurant menu. There doesn't appear to be very much seating inside so that automatically throws this off our our list of dinner go-to spots."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars but I am not sure it would post. If you like freezing cold food with warm ice tea , you have found it! Horrible service, we were greeted with a bowl of broken store bought chips and weak salsa, that was the high point! The waiter forgot to enter our order, when the food finally came it was ice cold. The manager picked up the tab, I prefer to have a good meal and pay. This Was torture. The staff is clueless. Sam fox has jumped the shark."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the salsa they call hot. it had a nice deep red color with a little bit of chunks and was slightly spicier than the other one.  I could tell the food was microwaved and not freshly prepared. When you're paying $14-$20 a plate you would expect your food to be made from scratch . The waitress made me feel rushed with my order and caused me to forget to order my Burrito enchilada style.  I asked for a side of cilantro and Received 1 teaspoon instead of a quarter cup. The refried beans were not really refried beans they were more like a can of pork and beans out of the cupboard and very bland. The margarita I ordered which was supposedly laced with Grand Marnier I could barely taste. In fact I'm not sure if there was less than one jigger of anything in the drink let alone a lasing of Grand Marnier. The rice tasted like it was your typical butter and salt white rice,The kind mother used to make. But definitely not your typical Mexican rice.  they offer no senior discount, no military discount, and no AAA discount. Boo Hoo... thumbs down for me. They only thing good I ordered today was that bowl of chicken tortilla soup! That I would come back for every day. Did I mention I had a fly flying around and landing on my food?!! I have to add the next day I had diarrhea"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their food. They have a great happy hour menu and if you are in a rush, they have a quick stop order window, which I like to order their po-boy shrimp sandwich. They also feature various aguas frescas (fresh fruit drinks) depending on what is in a season. They also have such great waiters and waitresses who exemplify great service. Try it out!"}
{"text":"So coming back!  No snobbery here. Everyone was polite and gave us great service. The food was delicious. Ordered the braised pork tacos and my hubs had the carne asado burrito. The chips were just the right salty and the salsa was full of flavor and not extremely spicy.  Definitely coming back to try other food on their menu plus I'll bring friends."}
{"text":"Short rib enchiladas were amazing. Defiantly will go back. Slow Service was only negative"}
{"text":"Offered to make it right when I had a problem so I can't complain. Good food, good atmosphere and hopefully they are working in customer service."}
{"text":"Came in and was told there was a 40min wait when half the restaurant was empty. I live in LA and am used to expecting that there, but this place was half dead. They had"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! Every single meal I had in Phoenix was incredible. The food here is so fresh and tasty. I had a chicken platter and shares a few other dishes with friends. Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious. The staff are friendly and nice. Also, the decor is very pretty!"}
{"text":"Great service! Delicious food. We came for restaurant week and were not disappointed! I tried the sparkling sangria, crab and shrimp ceviche, the chicken mole, and chocolate pie. The chips and salsa were great as well, there are three varieties are available. I plan on coming back for happy hour."}
{"text":"this is THE WORST Mexican/ taco restaurant EVER!!!!!  Overcooked, uninspired junk as food, plus it's over-priced compared to better places with better food."}
{"text":"Our meal was delicious but our service was a little bit slow, although very kind.  We waited a good 40 minutes until we were led to a booth that had been open the entire time.  With that being said, our waitress was very nice and suggested the chicken mole to my husband, which was fantastic.  We started with the ceviche, which included shrimp and crab and was fresh and flavorful.  The chips and salsa was also good.  I had the steak and shrimp fajitas, with street corn and rice, which was very good.  Their flour tortillas were yummy.  My daughter had a chicken and avocado cheese crisp, that was a good size and delicious.  We had classic margs, which were sour and delicious.  The service was a little slow, between courses, which is the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"It was just ok.  Good chips and salsa and guac.  I had the cheese enchilada and it was alright--just nothing special.  I did have the flan and that was the best part of the meal...tasted like creme brulee.  I may give it a shot again and try something else.  They do have great service."}
{"text":"$4.00 more for what seemed maybe 1 1/2 -2 oz's of chicken for my salad and I could barely find it. Not a good value...seem to be having a meat shortage. Better off paying half as much for real street taco's at an authentic Mexican restaurant. Want chicken to put on a salad?...go to Costco and buy a whole chicken for only one dollar more ($5.00 for whole rotisserie chicken)....tired of paying too much for mediocrity."}
{"text":"We love coming here for the happy hour and especially in the summer with their summer menu. Drinks are always on-par and service is usually good. Sitting outside has a great vibe and try their tacos, salads or the steak and avocado cheese crisp. Can't go wrong with the guacamole either! Yum!"}
{"text":"The place is very hip. Good Hh 3-6 half price starters drinks. Taco plates 15 + ok but wait staff could use some training.  Even bar staff not that on the ball."}
{"text":"Eek - I accidentally logged in with Facebook and it created a new account...please forgive my double entry.I will delete the other review.   My husband and I are new to Scottsdale and decided to try Blanco a couple weeks ago. We went on a Friday and did not have reservations. It was super crowded, of course, but the hostesses assured us that the wait was no more than 40 minutes.   We waited 45 minutes and noticed that there were still several people ahead of us due to people lingering at their tables longer than usual. Since we had already waited 45 minutes, we continued to wait. The hostesses and manager were very kind to everyone waiting, bringing around complimentary beverages and providing status on the wait. There were parties with reservations that showed up late so that caused some more waiting and after over an hour, we were seated in a lovely part of the restaurant.  The manager came over and apologized several times for our wait and thanked us for being so patient (others weren't). We should've made reservations and understood the wait process so there was no need for apologies, but they were greatly appreciated. We were provided with a free appetizer of chips and queso - it was DELICIOUS and a total surprise!   The ambiance of the restaurant was fantastic and our meals of enchiladas and fajitas was mouth-watering. The service was impeccable and the servers were very kind, attentive and knowledgeable of their menu. This restaurant really cares about their clientele.   I strongly recommend this restaurant and look forward to the cooler weather when we can go back and sit on their patio.   **PLEASE NOTE: If you visit, I urge you to make reservations. This is a super popular place and you don't want to wait, even though, IMO, it's worth the wait.  **I broke my own rule and rated this a 5 star right out the gate on the first visit. My reason being - the great customer service. Customer service like this is rare especially in a super busy establishment. They more than earned their 5 - well done Blanco!**"}

{"text":"I am a fan of Fox Restaurants and I've eaten here several times, but it's my least favorite out of the group.  It's not for a lack of trying...I've been here several times and it's always a popular place for clients and co-workers to meet for lunch.  Here's a list of items I've tried here:  Cheese Crisp - $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blanco-scottsdale?select=4hRGlNmDF3PPNkBfGKpq7g#4hRGlNmDF3PPNkBfGKpq7g  Blanco Burger (Manchego Cheese, Bacon, Guacamole, Pico de Gallo & Chipotle Mayo) - $11 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blanco-scottsdale?select=w439choXzufQTiLC7juxyw#w439choXzufQTiLC7juxyw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blanco-scottsdale?select=QbDaV7AvPjVyOeWHe_Da4g#QbDaV7AvPjVyOeWHe_Da4g  Carnitas Burrito - $13, Enchilada Style + $1 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blanco-scottsdale?select=ul-hW-7hknJCDcL4HphiRw#ul-hW-7hknJCDcL4HphiRw  Carnitas Tacos - $11 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blanco-scottsdale?select=eU2AFEWc0_g97OoDIO0dGQ#eU2AFEWc0_g97OoDIO0dGQ  The dishes with the most flavor was the Blanco Burger and the Carnitas Tacos.  Other than that, the food was mostly just OK.  You do get complimentary Chips & Salsa which is pretty good and filling.  You definitely won't leave here hungry.  Return Factor - 65%"}
{"text":"I crave this place on a weekly basis because it is just so good!  It is the perfect place to grab a fulfilling and tasty dinner after shopping at the Biltmore or during, they have a takeout window!    Two of my friends and I stopped in here around 5 pm after a long day of shopping for an early dinner.  We chose to sit outside and were seated at a low table with some couches.  The table had a cool mosaic design and the couch was a fun place to sit, although probably not the best place for a messy eater (I may or may not have spilled salsa on my shirt haha!).  The waitress brought warm tortilla chips and salsa which we absolutely loved (so much so that we got another basket and slightly spoiled our dinner!)  After looking at the menu for awhile we ordered.  I got the roasted chicken and poblano chile cheese crisp, one friend got the grilled fish tacos and the other got the green chile pork enchilada.  I had never had a cheese crisp before but it is certainly an interesting concept.  It reminds me of a Mexican pizza and had good flavor and a nice crunch to it.  I would definitely order it again but without the pico de gallo which kind of overwhelmed the flavor of the meat and cheese.  The fish tacos looked a bit small and I did not try them but my friend enjoyed them.  The enchilada came out in a dish and looked almost like lasagna but the flavor was amazing.  The tacos and enchilada came with rice and beans and the rice had good flavor and a nice buttery texture.  Next time I go to the Biltmore I'll have to stop at this place or try one of their other locations."}
{"text":"Mediocre effort by Fox. Food didn't impress me. Wait staff was \"dunlapping\" over her tight outfit. Not an appetizing sight people. Drinks were okay."}
{"text":"When we got there at 5:45, it was packed!  One high top table available with two chairs.  After checking in for 3, the hostess kindly put a chair up to the high top to accommodate us!  Waiter Alex was amazing - food amazing!  Our absolute FAVORITE Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale.  Oh, and btw - Sweetheart Margarita was amazing - had to order a second!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always have such great experiences. Their tacos are outstanding! You can even pick 3 different ones for the taco plate. Which I often do. Happy hour is very good and their margaritas are delicious!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Mediocre...for the price  For years I have kept trying to like Blanco.  I love the decor and the overall scene but aside from the short rib dishes, I find this place simply lacking in the food department.  Sam Fox usually has the Midas touch but this is on e menu that regularly disappoints.    The popular cheese crisps are unimaginative and shallow with the flavor profiles.  They are basic grocery-store quality flour tortillas with lackluster cheese coverage.  Unfortunately, I have had better at Taco Bell on road trips.  The street tacos are ok.  But for some reason the kitchen insists on dousing the plate with lettuce shred and bowls of can-quality black beans.  Even if the tacos come out flavorful (which is hit or miss on any given day), the execution of the whole plate is simply on par with school lunch lines.  Lastly, the classically solid Sam Fox service has been neglected.  I cant say I have been ignored but additionally, I cant say I have been impressed.  There are simply better restaurants in this class.  Modern Margarita in High Street up north by Desert Ridge is a classic example of one to watch."}
{"text":"Surviving on the Sam Fox name:  Let me first state that Sam Fox restaurants are typically well thought out and perfectly located.  So I have been to Blanco a half dozen times trying to get the square peg into the round hole...it just won't go.  While many may disagree with me, I also have found that diners, and especially Yelp reviewers, in Phoenix tend to rate the restaurant based on how much they paid for the meal, afraid to admit they simply got duped.  The reviews of Blanco are overly glowing and out of balance compared to sooooo many alternatives in the Valley.  To start, the decor in both the Biltmore and Old Bragada on Scottsdale Rd locations are pleasing but not as hip as the Fox standard.  Both are nice open spaces with large group tables a plenty.  The food is uninspiring and just not cravable.  In writing this review a day after my last attendance, I am having difficulty recalling the few things on the menu that made an impression.  I will try...  The roasted corn is flavorful, but this is a side dish and salad garnish.  The Mexican salad with steak is sparse in the meat department and routinely over dressed.  Fortunately there is roasted corn in the salad to rescue and provide an ounce of interest.  The quesadillas are just boring.  Cheddar and some other overly mild cheese melted on a tortilla.  No seasoning.  No deep flavored cheese.  No roasted corn to rescue (unless you ask specifically).  Additionally, they come sliced in massive wedges that effective tell everyone at the table, \"don't even try to share more than a bit with me, Amigo.\"  Just writing this I am bored.  So I will sum up the rest of the fare on the table.  Salsa=jar quality, Queso=velvet a with milk in a microwave, refried beers= try frying a third time, guacamole=woefully under seasoned and bland, chicken tacos=meh, shrimp tacos= too fishy (not even as good as Rubios).  Lastly the service...oy.  The waitress is quick to greet and ask for drink orders then disappear.  Each of the six times I have been reminded of the \"casual\" in casual dining.  Slowest dinner e-v-e-r..........  The gaps between drinks, apps, entree and dessert ordering are eternal.  Somebody needs to tell the staff that you make more money selling drinks and turning tables.  In 90minutes I didn't see any table turn more than once.  Listen, as a foodie in a great foodie city, I can safely endorse skipping Blanco.  If you want innovative Mexi-inspired food, try Sumo Maya, Modern Margarita or frankly any taco truck to out perform Sam Fox's black spot on his resume."}
{"text":"It seems as though above average service is hard to find on Saturday nights, but I was so pleasantly surprised by Andrew and his AMAZING service. He was definitely busy with a lot of tables but not once did I feel as though he couldn't handle what my table was throwing at him. He was extremely prompt with refills (both chips and drinks), had a great sense of urgency but I never felt rushed, validated my parking token without even asking, and was just a pleasant human being. Thank you, Andrew!!! Keep being so great. I'll definitely be back to this location, strictly to have Andrew as my server."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  Flavorful,  creative and hot. Served quickly with great service.  Drinks were okay,  Margherita somewhat sour the blood orange one, but could be from prior drinks. The atmosphere was trendy and hip. Great place will definitely return."}
{"text":"We are Fox Restaurant regulars and consider Blanco one of our favorites.  The Happy Hour is great and the drinks are amazing.  While I love the Margaritas, my new favorite is the Paloma, which is made with grapefruit juice and is really refreshing.  The chicken fajitas are delicious with a great onion and pepper saute.  They are so moist, plentiful and flavorful.  The staff is amazing and the atmosphere is fun and lively.  We have truly noticed a difference since the addition of General Manager, Chelsey Dever.  She makes you feel like you are coming to her home for dinner.  She is always smiling and friendly and takes hospitality to a new level.  While we love the food at Blanco, Chelsey is the reason that we come back each and every week.  Thank you Chelsey!  Keep up the good work! Nancy C."}
{"text":"Best chicken tacos and salsas in town! The chips are warm, flavorful and with just the right amount of firm crunch without scraping the skin off your gums. Try all three salsas. The rice and black beans are pure goodness. The taco plates come with 3 tacos, beans, rice and chips and salsa all for under $12.00. Great value for gourmet tacos."}
{"text":"There are quite a few expensive looking restaurants in The Borgata, but I don't know how they manage to stay open, it was practically deserted. Still, it was my first time there, so maybe that's the exception and not the norm. What set Blanco apart and ultimately made us decide to go here was the very welcoming outdoor space on a perfectly beautiful day.  The best part of the food came free, the chips and salsa. I'm a big fan of frescas and cucumber beverages so I ordered the cucumber-kumquat fresca it was very refreshing and delicious. Pistachio and Goat Cheese salad was disappointing; avocados were hard. I don't think avocados were even listed as part of the salad on the menu. If I were preparing it I'd never put a less than perfectly ripe avocado slice on a salad. It's like biting into ice cream and realizing it's \"light\" or being an innocent child who suddenly finds out life isn't fair or finding out the person you love doesn't love you back or...anyway it's heartrendingly disappointing. Please spread awareness about unripe avocados and refrain from serving them anywhere, ever.  But I digress. The patio situation was beautiful and comfortable, but eating a meal out there was very awkward. To make a long description short, the most comfortable ways to eat without occasionally dumping food all over myself were to hold the plate under my chin or lean over the small umbrella stand/table to my left."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon was my first visit to this restaurant with a group a friends. We waited for maybe 20min before we were able to sit. The environment was very open and modern, yet comfy. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu, answered all our questions and very fast. We ordered drinks and food and all came out in a reasonable time. The drinks were flavorful, potent and hit the spot! I ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style and OMG my mouth is watering now just thinking about it. We wanted to take my mother-in-law here for her latest visit from the East coast but I am always the type of person who wants to try a place first before taking guests. Now I can confidently saw we will be back when she visits in April if not sooner!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food was just fine but the customer service coming from our waitress was disappointing. My mom and dad ordered some tacos while waiting for me to join them. The waitress asked me if I wanted something to eat but the way she asked us was just not right. As we stood up from our table, she was walking by and she didn't even said bye or have a good day. I'm not sure what her problem was but we tipped her good although she didn't deserve it at all."}
{"text":"One word pops in my head when I think of Blanco...that word is delicious! We stopped in here last weekend with some friends and really enjoyed outer meal. There was a minor mix up with an appetizer but it wasn't a make or break for our dining experience.  We all got a margarita, of course. I went with a classic house on the rocks which was flavored very well. My husband got the Italian blood orange and it was realllly tasty. Our friend had the spicy mango rita which I friend and it had an excellent little kick to it from the jalape√±o.   We had a cheese crisp as an appetizer which ended up coming out as a quesadilla but they corrected it and provided us with a new order.  For our main meal we all went with the Machaca enchiladas since our friends recommended these as being the best. They were. They were flavorful and the meat was incredibly tender. I would recommend to everyone to try these at least once. I upgraded to the street corn side which was a nice touch. It's my favorite so I was glad to see they offered it.  All in all, we will 100% be back!!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the BEST food we have had in Arizona so far. There were 11 of us and It's always annoying to seat 11 people right during the lunch rush, but we were greeted promptly and seated by our waiter Doug who gave us absolutely phenomanal service. His knowledge of the food, recommendations, and bubbly personality made our experience exceptional. I felt like I was at a friends house, he seemed interested in what we were doing and made more than just small talk with us. Sometimes when I eat out I feel rushed and like just another patron, Doug made our entire party feel welcome, brought out everything correctly, promptly, and with much enthusiasm. As far as the food itself, it was to die for! There are Mexican restaurants around every corner in this area, and much of Arizona,  but I would strongly recommend coming here if you want FANTASTIC service, amazing fresh food, and an overall incredible dining experience. Thank you Doug for making our lunch so great! You deserve a raise!!!!! We loved you!  -Your customers from Bellingham Washington."}
{"text":"Love the Biltmore area and went to Blanco for the first time. The two bartenders working did an awesome job. The bartender Grady made my friends and I feel so welcome and ended up sitting at the bar for a few hours. If your looking for a classy place with great food and people hit up Blanco! P.S tacos are amazing!"}
{"text":"i'm a fan of sauce, north and some of the other fox restaurants because they have genuinely good food for a reasonable price and the restaurants are, in typical fox fashion, hip and easy on the eyes. i like that. blanco was no exception ... i adore the wood wall and tile work. i loved my white peach and hibiscus margarita. i loved the chips and salsa ... the chips reminded me of many trips to mexico ... they're very similar to the super yummy chips served down there. i did not love my seared ahi tacos. they were really fishy and the mango salsa was almost non-existent. it was too bad, because they really look beautiful on the plate. i wasn't super stoked about the rice, which was literally soaked in butter. the black beans were yummy. others at my table got the enchiladas, and i wish i had too. those enchiladas looked a lot better than my tacos tasted. our server was sweet, smart and encouraged us to modify menu items to our taste. there was definitely an arrogance in their prices because what you get for what you pay is pretty pathetic, but i guess you have to pay your rent in the borgata somehow. 3 stars for blanco. i really hoped for more."}
{"text":"Mexican modern. Authentic Flavors but non-traditional plating. Started with the roasted corn aka elot√© and loved it! Corn was lightly roasted, crisp and sweet. Off the Cobb and mixed in a creamy not-overly-mayo sauce with crumbled cheese topping ... Could use a sprinkle of taj√≠n but really just perfect as is.  The tacos were very delicious! All garnished with different toppings, your choice of tortillas, served with beans of your choice and rice.  Pickled radish for the bbq pork taco, ripe avocado for the grilled fish, and red peppers for the carne asada taco. Deeeeelicious!  My favorite was the hibiscus green tea, just like my abuelita used to make so refreshing and good.  Nothing too crazy with the food but enough change to make the dishes stand out.  The Hostess was sweet and friendly and service was consistent. A four star experience all around."}
{"text":"The ambiance is more tasteful than the food. Food wasn't bad, but It could of been better for what you're paying . They should also not be so stingy with the amount tequila poured in your drinks"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks and a light lunch while visiting Scottsdale for spring training.   Drinks: I had the margarita of the month (grapefruit margarita), and my boyfriend and his friend both for classic margaritas. We all enjoyed our drinks.   Food: tacos were decent. We got BBQ pork, carne asada, and carnitas. My boyfriend LOVED the bbq pork. I even liked it even though I don't really like bbq sauce. The carne asada and carnitas tacos were just alright. Our friend got the carne asada burrito and loved it. Biggest hit was the free chips and salsa; the salsa was delicious!  Atmosphere: best part! They have a huge outdoor area with large open doors so the inside could also enjoy the fresh air as well. Very open and bright. It was great to be able to enjoy the sun and nice weather."}
{"text":"This place has become one of our favorite \"go to\" restaurants! The tacos are absolutely amazing (I love the carnitas and crispy shrimp) and the staff is quick and so friendly. Great spot for happy hour as well! Also, do yourself a favor and make sure to upgrade your side to the street corn- you will be so glad you did! They also have completely dairy free options for those with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Not too noisy, open and airy. I ordered the green chili pork enchiladas. And the chart beans. Clean restrooms. $5 margaritas for happy hour. What's not to like!!"}
{"text":"Blanco was very good. It was hoppin on a Friday night, unlike many of the other restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix in this economy. The menu is a bit limited, but they do great with the Mexican style dishes (like tacos and cheesy dips) that they do offer. Our service at the bar was fantastic and the Margaritas were delicious :)"}
{"text":"Food, atmosphere, and service were all phenomenal! Val was an awesome server and I highly recommend stopping in. The pineapple Margarita and house-made guac are musts!"}
{"text":"This place consistently delivers a great meal and good service. Eat inside or outside, I've never left disappointed - but I always leave with leftovers. Making room for dessert is a must here!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Our first time here and everything we had was delicious.  Our server, James, was fantastic and gave excellent recos.  We loved the Queso, the Street tacos (short rib, carne asada), Enchiladas and the Roasted Corn.  We will be back...probably tomorrow."}
{"text":"They have a good HH menu. Half off margaritas and well drinks, and a few options for starters. I got the skinny margarita and my friend got the classic. Both of us had to send them back because they were so hard to drink. I understand that they use fresh lime juice to make these, but I'm not kidding when I say I left there with the beginnings of a canker sore in my mouth due to the high acidity of that margarita. And my friend needed alka seltzer after we left from getting an upset stomach. Wish they had wine on their HH, I would have opted for that instead.  On a positive note, they have a great salsa and good atmosphere. The manager did try to help us remedy the margarita issue by getting more agave added, but they were still nearly undrinkable.  I'll Probably go back at some point for a small bite off the HH menu, but will be avoiding the margaritas."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are consistently good, but after a rough day, the customer service we received tonight was insanely good. The hostess and bar staff went out of their way to let us sit where we could watch the game, and the bartender who took our  table, Tyler, was the best. Every other staff member we encountered were super polite and helpful, and we couldn't have had a better night. Many thanks to Tyler and the rest of the Blanco team!"}
{"text":"This place almost deserves five stars. They were super accommodating for our large party although we waited easily 45 minutes longer than their projected estimate-wait time. I understand it was a Friday night but we had little kids with us. The minute we were sat the wait staff was super attentive with chip refills and topping off drinks. I loved all three of their salsas and actually think I prefer the \"hot sauce\" best if you like spicy. I LOVE spicy and it didn't seem that hot. We got two orders of the queso and it tasted unlike any other queso I've had. Omg. What's in that?! It was incredible and velvety smooth. SO GLAD we got two cause we were scraping the skillets clean.  When I had to take my daughter to the bathroom I asked the host where to go. Instead of pointing in the direction of the restrooms he said \"follow me\" and WALKED ME THERE. Amazing customer service. I appreciated that and it doesn't go unnoticed.  They had a fun patio and a big open bar which looked great if you wanted to just stop in for a drink or an appetizer (queso).  I got the short rib enchiladas. Very unique how they're served in a mini skillet. For me personally, the sauce was a little much. I couldn't identify where the tortillas were and it was like swimming in sauce. Not sure if this is the norm but it kinda ruined it for me. I went through and picked out all the chunks of tender meat though and it was 100.  Their rice is to die for. So buttery and flavorful. I'm usually opposed to mexican restaurants who serve white rice (looking st you chipotle) because I love mexican rice so much but I'd take it over their beans even!  Blanco, I'll definitely be back. To try the tacos and eat my weight in queso."}
{"text":"The green chilie enchiladas were amazing. The chips are also really light and crispy. We also got the short rib nachos, the meat was so tender. And the service was really good and fast."}
{"text":"I just moved to Scottsdale and wanted some good Mexican food and a fun place. Our server was prompt and friendly and when I asked what her recommendation was she gave me several options.   The chips and salsa were perfect and the waitress refilled them without us even having to ask. Our food came out promptly and was delicious. As a whole, this restaurant was fantastic and I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"As a person that grew up in South Texas my palate for Mexican food is very specific. The pork and chicken enchilada are MUY DELICIOSO.   Sadly nothing else I had was special. The \"butter\" rice is tasty but not what I'm looking for and the beans were not \"boracho\" other than beer thrown in there completely lacked depth. I did not have the elite but I will next time. Enchiladas are worth A visit"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and the service sucked.  I had fish tacos and got food poisoning.  I'll never go back...."}
{"text":"Sadly I was let down on this, I had heard so much good about it, but either today was a bad day or this is not my style of Mex.  The highlight was the Mexican Pizza we had as an appatizer."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this Blanco, and I have to say that the service is what keeps me coming back! The food is great too but if you ever have an issue with anything they are willing to go above and beyond for you with out you even asking for it. I remeber one time a group of friends and I went in to grab some food before going out on a sat night and at some point the server asked us if he could get us anything and we jokingly mentioned a candy bar. As we were ready to close out and our bill arrived, the server pulled out the candy that was jokingly requested! Now that's service! Stop in when you get a chance you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Food and ambience is AMAZING! So original and so delicious. What dragged my review down from FIVE STARS is the inefficiency. Walked in at 8pm on a Friday with multiple open tables and was quoted an hour wait...um, what? After staring at the aforementioned open tables for 15 minutes I asked for a manager. Thankfully we only waited 30ish minutes and our server was great. Food came out fast and was piping hot. Manager hooked us up for the abysmal start. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great guacamole and chips to start. I ordered the mushroom tacos and had some of the fajitas with chicken/shrimp. The roasted flavor overpowered the fajitas but my tacos were out of this world. The music was loud so conversation was limited but good food."}
{"text":"Food is a 3/4 but service is a 2.  Hubby and I stopped here for a late lunch - about 1:30 on a Friday so a decent crowd but not crowded by any stretch.  We were greeted and seated quickly, waitress came by and we ordered a margarita each.  Chips and salsa were delivered - salsa is excellent, our chips were mashed pieces for some reason.  Drinks came quickly, we ordered some guac - we were off to a great start.  Then came the first lull.  When the guac was dropped off, we ordered food and my hubby ordered another margarita.  We had to waive someone down to ask for some more (full-sized) chips.  Guac was okay, nothing special.  Then we waited, and waited, and no one brought his drink.  We stopped our waitress to ask for some more salsa.  10 minutes later, our entrees came - no drink for my hubby, no salsa.  Waitress came by again, grabbed the empty salsa bowl, and I ordered another drink.  Those were all dropped off and we didn't see anyone else until we were ready to go.  Even then it wasn't our waitress - it was another girl who dropped off containers and the check.  We were slightly surprised at the price of the check - it's scottsdale but still...Food was decent but nothing special (think Chipotle at a full service restaurant).  Service would have made the difference but fell short.  Underwhelming experience - we won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service!!! There was an hour and a half wait and the hostess was amazing and put us on the list when we called ahead! Our waitress was so great and attentive even though it was crazy busy!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for some quality Mexican food and this place did not disappoint.  Had the beef enchiladas and recommend it.    I will return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants and I also love that it is a fox restaurant too!! I'm a huge fan of Sam Fox's restaurants also because half of my friends work at a couple of them! I love the vibe here at Blanco. It's smaller than the Biltmore location but I love it here still. I always get the carne Asada tacos but today I switched it up with the sweet pork. Of course it was award winning! The rice is to die for and not because I'm Asian. The blanco queso is awesome and their complimentary salsa is great too. I always leave happy after a meal at Blanco."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on a Friday afternoon. Glad we went around 4:30ish because it definitely picked up when we're there!  First, their happy hour is really good! 50% off starters and margaritas and well cocktails..now did it make me happy? Not when I got the check...but I'll get to that later.  We ordered the warm queso blanco and cheese quesadilla..(which I thought we ordered the chicken quesadilla...but we'll get to that later too) and a Moscow Mule and Pineapple Daly. We asked our waitress if the Moscow Mule counted as a well cocktail, and she said yes, it'll be 50% off.  The chips and salsa were so good!! The salsa has a spicy kick to it, and got spicier towards the end of the meal. The cheese dip was sooo good too!!! For $1.50?! Yes! Our cheese quesadilla arrived at the same time, and I said, \"I thought we ordered the chicken quesadilla.\" My boyfriend said he ordered the cheese quesadilla, so I was like oh okay. The guy who delivered it (who seems to be the manager/owner?) said, and with a smile, that he would switch it for us because he wanted to make our order right! We were totally fine with the cheese quesadilla though, so we didn't have him change it. Then a little later, he comes back with a side of braised chicken so we can have the best of both worlds! WOW! So nice of him! And glad we tried the quesadilla with the chicken, because it's so good!!!  The place was very nice and lively, and my boyfriend ended up getting 3 moscow mules because he's happppy! Well, then the check came. I noticed that my Pineapple Daly was not on happy hour...my bad because I mistook signature cocktails as well cocktails. In my opinion though, since we ordered everything else from happy hour...our waitress should of mentioned that my drink wasn't 50% off. But in the end, it's my bad. Oh side note, the Pineapple Daly wasn't that good. Can definitely taste the pineapple juice...eh. The Moscow Mules though, were $6 each..we asked the waitress, and she said it's 50% on the well vodka, which makes it $3.75, and there's an upcharge of $2.25 for the ginger beer and other stuff. Like what? The lime juice? Really disappointed in that...does not make sense at all....She said it's 50% well cocktails...not 50% well vodka and then an upcharge of everything else.   Well that was a sad way to end our time there. But anyways...besides that, everything else was enjoyable!! Would definitely go back...this time without any drinks."}
{"text":"Blanco had such a cool atmosphere going for them! Outside patio is nice and all the restraint is open so you don't feel left off in a corner somewhere. I tend to come here more for happy hour deals then dinner entries but that doesn't mean the food is bad. THE GUAC IS A MUST! I get it every time and I swear it's so good and I tend to just eat that,salsa, and margs, which is why I tend to not have room for any entrees! The staff has always been nice and have no issue getting you chip and salsa refills 2-3 times lol"}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced! I had the carne asada tacos with beans and corn. Definitely worth the up charge for the corn. Also had the trio dip appetizer - perfect starter and sized just right for sharing."}
{"text":"Should this actually be a 2 star review rather than 3? Probably, but I have eaten here several times in the past and enjoyed the casual environment.   This seems to be the case of a good restaurant on the down hill slide. The service has gotten worse with each visit. This time the service was less than desirable. There was a really cute young lady at another table that got GREAT service from our waiter. Hey, I can't blame our waiter, I just don't want my family to not have what they want or need.   When we asked him why there were only 2 tacos when he said the meal comes with 3, he went on a diatribe about how the Chef's and servers need to get on the same page. \"Some chef's are cool with it (3 tacos vs. 2) and others aren't. We (Wait staff and kitchen staff) need to get on the same page.\" This looks like a lack of management control.  Too bad! I likely won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Blanco is soooo good. Because of that they get 4 stars! Which is great!   The carnitas tacos come with some delicious sauce and they are my favorite.  The cheese crisps are delicious and probably one of the more popular items here.   Good happy hour and good food."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family, it was a 35 minute wait so we decided to take a table outside since there were heaters and we didn't want to wait.  Once we were seated it took about 20 minutes for our waitress to greet us and take our drink orders.  Next the waitress spilled my dad's drink all over the table and my sister and I.    Also, the outdoor heaters kept turning off every 10 minutes and we had to keep requesting they be turned back on.  The waitress from the next table over had to keep helping us because our waitress was clearly struggling.  I used to really like this restaurant, however after this experience I don't think I will be returning due to the poor service."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Carnitas tacos and the corn appetizer and braised pork cheese crisp were my favorites. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Utterly forgettable, corporate-lunch Mexican. Bland food, mediocre service. Can't imagine coming back here, given how many better options for Mexican food there are in Phoenix. Avoid."}
{"text":"I loved this place so much! I'm from Iowa and it's hard to find good gluten free food because I'm celiac, but Blanco Tacos made my day completely. I sat down and asked the waiter what they had that was gluten free and he said everything on the menu can be made gluten free by simply using corn tortillas. It get great having the feeling of ordering off of a full menu, not just having one or two options. The chips, salsa, guacamole, queso, and the enchilada were to die for. When I'm back in Scottsdale I will definitely be coming back. Service was great. Food was great. And the experience was great."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with my visit this past Saturday. I'm generally a huge fan of Fox Restaurants, but this one fell short.   We made a reservation for about 13 people and ended up waiting almost 30-45min past our scheduled reservation time to be seated.   Once we were finally seated, then came the ordering. With me being on such a strict diet, I was a bit skeptical about finding anything on the menu. I ended up ordering the Blanco Chopped Salad. which on the menu is described as \"Grilled Chicken, Seasonal Fruits, Pepitas (pumpkin seeds)\" for $9. Sounds tastey right? Well before ordering it, I did ask the server if the 'salad' had lettuce in it, and he assured me it was lush mixed greens with mixed fruit, chicken, pepitas and a cilantro lime dressing. \"Perfect!\" Well that's not what I got.  Apparently mixed seasonal fruits meant just apples and there was tomatos chopped up in it. Now understand, tomatos are considered a fruit, but when you read seasonal fruits, a tomato is the last thing on my mind. They were totally reaching there. And when I read fruits, I'm assuming more than 2. FAIL.  Needless to say, I came in with no expecations and walked away completely disappointed.   I usually try and make one more attempt to go back to make a confirmed judgement, but this first visit literally left a bad taste in my mouth. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ya gotta live a place that has Happy Hour on Sundays!!!  3 mini tacos for $7!!! Cheers!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. Delicious house made chips and tortillas. Tried the Mexican corn- yum. Sampled the BBQ pork tacos and fish tacos on corn and flour tortillas respectively- would recommend both. Our server was extremely attentive. Will be back. Have not been disappointed with any Fox restaurants.  Very welcoming decor. Great lunch or dinner stop when near the Biltmore."}
{"text":"Visited Blanco for the first time for a work happy hour get-together. There were about 15 of us but we made reservations so we got a great table right by the bar.    We ordered a few rounds of drinks and some guacamole to go with the chips and salsa. I had a peach margarita in a sugar-rimmed glass. It was really yummy and they did not skimp on the alcohol! The chips, salsa and guacamole were also really good. The guacamole had huge chunks of fresh avocado in it, which I really enjoyed - you could tell this was not out a can!  The whole time our server was super attentive. Our water glasses and chip bowls were always full, and he was constantly on top of making sure we had enough drinks without being pushy. Juggling a table this big can be tricky but we felt very taken care of the whole time.  If you have a big group, Blanco is very accommodating. I didn't get to try dinner but I would love to go back and try some of their tacos."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Phoenix/ Scottsdale. It's affordable, has awesome service, the best queso, and is consistently super delicious. Also happy hour is worth a drive if you have time."}
{"text":"Blanco is okay. It doesn't boast the best mexican food in Scottsdale - in fact its far from it. But the service is good, the space is large and the overall experience was A-Ok.  We started with the guac; it was fresh, but needed salt. The mexican chopped salad was okay, but it didn't have much romaine or greens in it. In other words, it didn't seem like much of a salad. I had the tacos; the mushroom tacos tasted more like spicy salsa tacos and the fish tacos were just bland.   One thing Blanco did well was dessert. The tres leches was awesome.   I wouldn't come back unless I had a lot big group of people who couldn't be accommodated anywhere else."}
{"text":"The service was good, except she interpreted lemonade from the sprite my son ordered. I ordered the happy hour menu taco and quesadilla; which ended up being very small items.  Both items were tasty, though.  My son had the grilled chicken burrito which he also liked, but the rice was a spoon sized amount and the beans were salty.  Not a very happy experience, but I haven't ruled them out just yet."}
{"text":"Dined here tonight for the first time. Average to say the least.  It's not that the food is bad ; it's just safe, predictable, run of the mill food in a nice atmosphere. Its very over priced for the quality of food you get. In a nutshell  it's a Fox Concept Restaurant. If you are looking for a taste bud experience you are not going to find it here.  Would I dine here again? Yes , I would (if invited by friends)  but my expectations would be as if I was dining at Denny's or an IHOP that way I would not feel disappointed in the quality of the food experience."}
{"text":"Amazing beef tacos and for only for $3!! Nachos were amazing! Too bad I live in California! This place is amazing, it's quick and cheap and so yummy"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I decided on 2 stars with the highlights being atmosphere, impeccable service, and delicious sangria.   Now- the lowlights. The tacos were pretty good but not great. I tried the original carnitas (best), chipotle shrimp (decent, shrimp was obviously frozen), and the short rib (short ribs were dry despite the sour cream and pico de gallo).   The absolute worst piece of the meal was the appetizer we ordered. We got the seafood ceviche which had scallops, shrimp, and mahi mahi. Sounds great right?? WRONG. It is a crime to serve this outside of a Red Lobster. The frozen shrimp was the least of the offensive. The scallops were rubbery, the orange segments (apparently what the chef thought should act as the main citrus) were CANNED. They were huge and uniform in size. Could it get worse, you ask? Let me assure you- it can. The mahi mahi was served at the bottom of the serving dish as 1 large filet. And it was cooked? Did anyone bother to be educated on what ceviche is? Not only was it cooked, it was overcooked to the point that it tasted like rubber. I couldn't even cut it with my fork. The only reason I went back in for more than 1 bite was because we waited 90 minutes for a table (wait time quoted at 45 min) and I was starving.   I would give 1 star for the tacos and sangria, it's at least worth that, and honestly our server gave 5 star service. Too bad the food couldn't compete. If you go here, stay as far away from the ceviche as possible."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood favorite.  My wife and I go a couple times a week and generally just sit at the bar for food and drinks.   The bartenders are awesome.  Rob, Haylee, and Lupita are all fantastic and friendly.  They make us feel right at home and are half the reason we keep coming back so often.  The other half is the great food.  Never disappoints, and they are always willing to customize an order for us if we ask.  Fun atmosphere.  Great for family, night out with friends or even a date night."}
{"text":"After yelping for good restraunts in the area during a business trip to the area, my colleagues and I decided on Blanco for dinner after a long day.  parking is available .  Atmosphere: Somewhat casual.  Interior: Open floorplan . Dim and airy. Two outdoor space to eat. (We sat outside) Clean restrooms.  Service: Good. Greeted us upon arrival. Waitress was nice and helpful, food service was a bit slow however.  Food: Menu has many options to choose from! I ordered:  enchilada style carne asada burrito. *this guy had sooooooo much flavor and cheese topped with an excellent (but not spicy Verde sauce) .  Blood Orange Margarita. *really good, but only  little bit of alcohol    Cons: Slow service. Margarita didn't have much alcohol at all.  Overall: Very good meal. A little pricy   I will return"}
{"text":"We really had no expectations. I had the burrito. But it's more like lasagna, with short ribs. I was so amazed at the perfectly prepared dish I had to write a quick review. For me a restaurant must have a selection of decent tequila, and they do. A little 1942 is always a perfect aperitif. The fajitas and fish tacos were about as good as we have had anywhere. Nice indoor and outdoor atmosphere. They even have a basement for parties. If you are in the neighborhood, do try. You will be happy you did!"}
{"text":"They have a number of great margaritas, including skinny margaritas and some options with other fruit juices like grapefruit.  The food is pretty generic Mexican, but is priced higher than that, so the value just isn't there."}
{"text":"the Fox corporation owns this one along with it's next door neighbor  \" J. Alexanders\". I havent made a meal in my kitchen for years and depend upon the good restauranteurs of Phoenix for sustanence. Sadly these two places mentioned herein are  now off the rotation list of places to eat.  WE have watched the corporate cutbacks on food quality gradually decline into unacceptable levels. September 23rd , I ordered fish tacos with a side of guacomole. What I got was three miniscule 3 inch tortillas each containing a very small,  less than bite size piece of fish.  I have seen these small tortillas at other eateries served as appetizers in portions of three just like this offering. The fish tacos were about 15 bucks! The side of guacomole was 9 bucks!  Even if the food was excellent  (which it was far from) the portion size was pathetic .  Just a bad deal all way around.  Locals avoid it now and apparently the locale next to several hotels may keep it going. Unsuspecting tourists be warned.  AVOID this one."}
{"text":"okay, so I haven't eaten all day and now it's late, pretty late & I am at that stage where I need to eat!  So, I go to good ol Yelp to search for something around & I love the fact Yelp lists business hours too!  So, of course all my top choices are closed except for, yup, you guessed it, da da da daaaaa Blanco!    It was pretty empty, well they were closing in 30minutes, we sat at the bar and ordered the Braised Short Rib & Avocado cheese crisp and the Camarones Tacos.  The cheese crisp was awesome, I will confess I have a wee bit of an obsession with short rib, and this was pretty good, I will go back for just that!  I wanted to get the short rib tacos too, but my hand was spanked & firmly told 'no'...  The shrimp tacos were okay, they weren't 'OMG I'm salivating just thinking of them', but they weren't awful.    And, the service, well I can't really say anything about that....  Because, we saw our server twice, good thing we paid cash, Lord only knows how long we would have waited for her...  I shall return, but I'll be doing it for happy hour! Monday-Thursday: 4-6pm * All cheese crisps, starters, house margaritas, well drinks and draft beers 50% off."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos! I had the crunchy, he had the street tacos! All were excellent. The service was great! Jimmy took such great care of us; so professional and attentive but not over-bearing in any way. Our food came out quickly even though they were super busy. I was hesitant to sit outside under the misters in 104 degrees but I'm so glad we did. A lovely...lovely experience!"}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos were amazing. The service was fantastic and they did all they could to get us seated quickly on a busy night. I saw a bunch of other dishes go by that looked so good. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Blanco is great! Good prices for the quality of food. The street tacos are amazing and the atmosphere is great. I hate how they don't take reservations or call aheads so at a prime time on Friday or Saturday expect a 30 minute wait minimum."}
{"text":"We had a fun time with our party of seven on a Friday evening. I really like the high beam rafters, the blue earth tone colors throughout, the cute hostess dresses and the striped shirts that the wait staff wears.  We had a blood orange margarita, pomegranate margarita and fresh chips w/tasty guacamole & salsa. I would opt for the blood orange margie- refreshing, zesty with a bitter sweet flavor. We had multiple bartenders, all very friendly & engaging.  For dinner we moved from the bar, to an outside table.  Paul our accommodating waiter, did a nice job of taking us through a delicious dinner. We all had various sea food items and loved it.  This is a great addition to the Scottsdale dining scene with terrific people watching.  Muy bien Blanco!"}
{"text":"Great beer, food and tequila with excellence service and plenty of TVs for watching sports. We found this place to be underrated."}
{"text":"Love This Place!  - Great Food - Great Service - A Tad Bit Expensive But Worth It  They used to have the best Posole in town but have taken it off the menu :-(!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a coworker who used to live on the area. Great suggestion.  Good service. We waited for 45 minutes, not too bad for the dinner hour. Had the green poke burrito  it was beyond awesome! Will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"A lively mid-range restaurant. The crowd was mixed, but was comprised mostly of families. Strangely they played clubby music in the background.   Service was really good, there were about five people servicing our table as a team. Everything came out quickly and they were able to accommodate all the bizarre dietary needs of our finicky group.  The food itself was pretty basic. The big eye tuna ceviche was a significant deviation from real deal, it appeared to have small pieces of tortilla chips mixed in which through me off. The chicken fajitas were fine, but weren't a huge step up from something you could get at a chain.  Final word: Ok for a casual or family dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos! The ceviche salad for starters is amazing- fresh and chilled and light. Easily split between two people. Customer service was excellent. Had the frozen margarita- it was so so."}
{"text":"A-mazing!!!! The enchiladas are a MUST try!! The tacos... Some of the best I've had! The rice here is divine and unlike any other I've had. But the best we've had so far..  The Mexican street corn!! Can't wait to come back and try so more items :)"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place. They have a live Dj as well and plays a variety of music. Great food. Great place to just hang out and have some dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"I used to live across the street from Blancos and this is one of my go-to spots whenever I'm near the Biltmore mall.  The guacamole is fantastic and the margaritas are delicious.  The service is typically of any Sam Fox restaurant...always great.  The chips here aren't my favorite, but you can't go wrong with any of the tacos on the menu.  It's also a great little place for happy hour."}
{"text":"We were at the Biltmore shopping mall for the first time and figured we'd stop into Blanco for some refreshments. Sat in the bar and received chips and salsa quick. Ordered a few of their flavored margaritas and they were very good! Especially the jalapeno mango. A margarita I'll definitely remember.   Didn't order any meals but we ordered the guacamole to go with the chips and salsa. It was amazing! Kinda spendy but worth it for the amount they give you and the quality. Would return to try the rest of the menu for sure."}
{"text":"I've rated higher, but today my order was boring, chipotle shrimp tacos didn't really have much spice and the tacos over stuffed with the extras fell out and made for a messy meal. ( I know tacos but could've been built better). The service was excellent no complaints there!  Still a point of destination when in the area. Okay, I wanted to add a note after reviewing some of the other recent ones and while we all have different taste, therefore different expectations I want to remind everyone that if there is something wrong or we don't like let Management know and give them a chance to correct. Even if the server fixes what's wrong, speak with management let them know of the problem and how it was managed even the successes help make it better.  Anyway always remember the problem no matter how big or how small - it cannot be fixed if no one says nothing!"}
{"text":"Ordered the carnitas taco with avocado instead of carnitas. There was no sour cream or salsa and when I told the girl working she told me sour cream was on the bottom, I had to pick through the taco to prove it, she then said the salsa was marinated with the carnitas (which were not on my taco) did not apologize and they didn't re-make the taco they just gave me a side of salsa HA -12 star service. It's a 4 dollar taco of basically all lettuce, be reasonable. Apologize and take care of it. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Top notch service at the bar. Kick @ss margaritas and the happy hour is ridiculously cheap. Tacos were tasty. Their 3 dip appetizer was somewhat of a let down though."}
{"text":"One of the best burritio I've ever had.  That's high praise, I know.  The short rib meat was fantastic and the burrito construction was just perfect.  It wasn't bursting at the seams but it was well filled and balanced.  Now, your main complaint might be \"Mike - it was $13 for that burrito.\"  I hear you...it is expensive but then again, you probably will eat $8 in chips and salsa before you get that burrito.  Throw in the delicious rice and beans side it comes with and you're getting a fair price.    I've also had the crips (think mexican pizza) and the enchiladas.  Both were very good but I'll be sticking with burritos in the future.  Additionally they have a good happy hour M-F with 1/2 price apps.  The guac is definitely worth ordering."}
{"text":"We were in last week on a Thursday night.  The server was fantastic. However, the food was lacking. We have been too this location several times before but today it was very subpar. The rice was salty and dry. Three people had the fish tacos and all sent them back. They offered to replace one meal out of the three and paid for two out of the three fish taco entrees. The fish was super fishy and undercooked. You could smell that extra fishy smell across the table and on them after they had touched it. Thankfully no one got ill. The other two meals were short rib tacos which were good but rice was sill bad. It would've been nice if manager paid for all three fish entrees and replaced their meals."}
{"text":"Excellent blood orange margaritas!! The chicken enchiladas are served in a cute steaming hot cast skillet. Food is a tad on the bland side which is good if you have stomach issues. Good atmosphere for meeting with friends and family."}
{"text":"The main reason I come to Blanco is for their margaritas - mainly the Peach Hibiscus Margarita as it is divine! I could drink these all night and promised my husband we will come for happy hour and do just that. Seriously, best margaritas. (I've tried their pomegranate one as well, which is really good but the peach... oh, the peach.)   Happy Hour is 4-6pm and half off all margaritas, well cocktails, beers, and some appetizers. We've had their guacamole and we really like their three cheese quesadilla with chicken.  As for dinner, I love their beef 'house specialty' enchiladas - braised short ribs in a red sauce. Super delicious and one of my favorite meals. Makes really good leftovers for lunch the next day as well! My husband likes their burritos and normally gets the machaca. When ordering a dish, you have the option of black beans or pinto beans. I always get the black beans, but I'll have to try the pinto at some point. Additionally, the rice is super buttery and delicious.    I would highly recommend this place for a date, a get together with friends, or if the family is in town. There is always ample parking out front (or valet services), the inside is decorated nicely and the patio is wonderful. I've already promised my aunt a margarita when she visits, but I'll definitely be back before then!"}
{"text":"Upscale Mexican at its finest!  We enjoyed a early dinner during happy hour that included guacamole and queso dip with warm chips.  We each had carne asada tacos with black beans and rice.  It was a delicious dinner and I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I had the green chile pork burrito.  It was above average and I would order again.  The service was great.  My drink was always full and the server kept us full on chips/salsa."}
{"text":"Considering Fox Concepts seem to engulf a massive chunk of Biltmore Fashion's restaurant space, it was only a matter of time before we'd finally pay a visit to Blanco Tacos. In short, it's pretty much what I expected. Slightly above average tacos served in a sleekly decorated setting, but not quite good enough to where I feel it's worth a revisit.  We ordered a variety of tacos to sample, including the carne asada, BBQ, carnitas, and roasted chicken. Nothing was really bad, but nothing really stood out as something mind-blowingly delicious. You have the option of either flour or corn tortillas. Both work fine.  As for sides, the butter-infused rice tasted great at first, as most things with butter always do. But after several bites, I had no desire to keep eating. The butter flavor should be more restrained, providing more of a subtle compliment rather than completely dominating the rice. The street corn suffers from a similar issue. The first few bites are the most enjoyable, until you can barely finish the remainder of the dish due to mayonnaise overload. The beans, on the other hand, were a stark contrast, as we couldn't really taste much flavor in them.  For dessert, we tried the Mexican Chocolate Cake. Although I maintain that it would work much better as a sponge texture, it was still decent in its harder form. The subtle hints of cinnamon and salt were both nice additions. With a scoop of ice cream, you can't really complain, although I'll probably forget I even ordered it within a few weeks.    Our server was polite and the service itself was good. No issues with food quality. I'm sure if you're an entry-level taco fan or love margaritas, it'll do just fine for a gathering or date. But in a place like Phoenix that has such a heavy Hispanic culture, there's far too many other options to rely on Blanco as a go-to taco spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! The happy hour is awesome and the atmosphere is super neat. I love coming here and having The trio dip and chicken tacos extra queso!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the mood for a little Mexican dining tonight, so we decided to give Blanco a try.   Blanco had everything going for it when we got there. We found a parking space right upon driving in, we were seated in a big semicircular booth that offered a great view for people watching, and we were intrigued by the menu.   We really enjoyed the atmosphere here. The modern, tres chic feel was counterbalanced by the whitewashed wood in the ceiling giving the place an ambiance that was part beach, part Scottsdale.   As others have said, the food is quite good. The slightly-sweet-yet-spicy salsa that arrives with a bowl of freshly fried tortilla chips was very good (and slightly reminiscent of what On The Border used to serve, just not that sweet). We opted for margaritas (she had the blood orange version while I stuck with a traditional blended marg) which we both agreed were flavorful without being overloaded with tequila.   In particular, we really liked the braised short rib. We got it on the cheesy tortilla item (think 12\" tortilla made into a Mexican pizza) and it was accompanied by avocado and some other veggies and was delicious.   We also ordered the carnitas tacos which they offered to split for us (giving each of us our own rice, beans, and one taco). The pork was tender and not fatty (a gripe I often have of Chipotle and the like) and the tacos were very good when accompanied by a little guacamole and sour cream.   So why only three stars? There were a few things dragging down Blanco for us. They include:   1. SLOOOOW Service - judging from other reviews, it doesn't sound as if this is always a problem, but everything moved slowly for us when we were there (drinks took over 10 minutes to arrive after ordering, food took almost 30 minutes). I know when the service could be better as I start getting Antsy waiting for stuff after a certain point and that happened when we were at Blanco.   2. Warm, not hot, food - The manager asked us how everything was and we commented that our pizza wasn't very hot when it arrived at our table. I'll give him credit for marching back over to the open kitchen and sharing his thoughts on the matter with the staff, but I would have expected hot food. My guess is that the slow service may have had something to do with this.   3. Overall food prep - there were just a few things that could be improved. For example, using two tortillas per soft tacos would keep them together a bit more. Leaving the Pico de Gallo on the side would keep people (like my wife) who don't eat it from having to scrape it off.   One note on the Guacamole - there are two sizes (an appetizer size for $9 and a side item size for $5). We opted for the smaller size and they brought it out with our chips. There was PLENTY for using before and with dinner for two people so consider this option if you want to save $4.   We'll give Blanco another try in the future - it has all the right elements to earn four stars from us...next time they just have to deliver on them."}
{"text":"Second time here this week. Was such a great experience the last time that I'm back again in just a few days. Very reasonably priced food. I live in Mesa and will definitely make this a regular lunch spot during the week.   The blood orange margarita is my favorite and the guacamole is great.   The service has been great both times. Have been served by Erin, Shanna, Chelsea and Alex. All have been tremendously helpful in recommendations and prompt service. And all of them are very friendly with contagious smiles.   I will be be back!"}
{"text":"Great place. Megan the manager is amazing... Will be coming back here for sure. Our server Tyler was great too."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to dine here both for the food and service.  A great place to meet up with friends and visitors.  Whether indoors, outdoors or at the bar, there is a lot of good energy.  The menu evolves so we enjoy trying out new cocktails and fare.  The latest tortas and the mango jalape√±o margarita are adventurous.  The guac is good for sharing.  Everyone will want their own order of the street corn.  Generous happy hour choices."}
{"text":"This is really great American Mexican food with modern decor. My friends and I came here for Halloween night dinner before a party and all the staff were very friendly. I had the short rib enchiladas and they were really tasty. The complimentary chips and salsa were delicious too. Would recommend if you are looking for some solid American Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend who had been to the Scottsdale location and decided to try out the biltmore one since it's closest to where I live downtown. Had two happy hour margaritas....blood orange and Pom grapefruit. No complaints at all. Had the two drinks and free chips and salsa...bartenders were all attentive and polite. Will be back."}
{"text":"I had to look for a kid-friendly restaurant to dine at this weekend, but I wanted to pick a place that still had good food and atmosphere for the adults to enjoy too.  Blanco Tacos was the perfect place to have this type of meal.  The restaurant is loud and provides high chairs, so the atmosphere is perfect if you have little ones (esp. ones who like to \"talk\" - aka screech - a lot...but I digress...).  Plus, there is a kids menu, along with a good sized \"adults\" menu too.    The food came out promptly, hot and tasty!  Plus, the margaritas helped A LOT with the kid noise ;)  Definitely recommend coming here for some family friendly dining fun!"}
{"text":"Super fresh, amazing Guacamole, awesome margaritas ! Cool spot, great service. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"LOVED my visit here. You can mix and match tacos to make your own plate, and the salsa and guacamole were killer.   If I didn't live 400 miles away, I'd be here regularly."}
{"text":"Great outdoor atmosphere from the bar area (I prefer sitting at the bar if available). Great happy hour drinks! Happy hour menu portions small but tasty. All bartenders super friendly and very attentive. Will def back for more."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with one of my company's vendors and was pretty blown away by the quality of their street tacos! Yeah they're small as street tacos usually are but they pack a ton of flavor and for the set of 3 they give you in a set, combined with the chips to start your meal, you won't leave hungry. I ordered the carne asada, green chile chicken, and chipotle shrimp tacos. Each one had its own unique zest and flavor. I also ordered guacamole to go with the chips which was a good call as the salsa they provide free is good but the guac is so bomb!  The only reasons I don't give this place 5 stars are twofold: the random fly that would not leave me alone during my entire meal inside the restaurant and the fact that their non-alcoholic beverage list is basically Pepsi products, lemonade, and iced tea. Where the horchata at doe!? That would totally rock if they added some house horchata. Jus sayin! Anyways, if you're in the mood for good quality Mexican food at Biltmore, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Really good food. Piss poor service. Typical Scotrsdale attitude. Call me old fashion, but I prefer the staff to care you are spending your money in their establishment with all the other choices in the area"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with this place.  I love it, but hate how I feel when I walk out.  damn those chips and salsa they bring out!!     One of my favorite appetizers is the Nachos.  They are absolutely enormous and two people can easily share it for an entr√©e and be full. I personally love the short rib version, but they offer chicken as well..  covered in black beans, cilantro, cheese, etc; it's a very tasty yet filling 'appetizer'.  I've had the tacos before as this is obviously a taco joint.  I loved them every time. I went against habit this last time and ordered the chicken mole and disliked it immensely.  I'm only downgrading one star because I've been to this location and the Scottsdale location so many times that I know they do better. The mole was not 'mole' as I was expecting as it was really really sweet. And kind of 'red'. It was weird. That and the chicken was served in a bowl with rice.  It was just not my liking.     That being said, I've loved the tacos, enchiladas and the shrimp/crab ceviche as well.    Good happy hour deals as well."}
{"text":"In the land of Tex Mex here, we aren't short on tacos, burritos, margaritas, etc. So, I'm thinking that taco joints are really scrutinized.  So yeah.. I'll scrutinize.  This really isn't a 'joint', rather a 'scene'.  It's not a total douchebag scene like you'd get in Old Town (I live there, so I can say that); but it is more of an upscale Mexican place.  Not as fancy pants as The Mission, but not Frank and Lupe's....  However, it's just a little too pricey for what you get.  All of us got the tacos.  Bonus, they have quite a variety of street tacos and for $1 extra you can mix and match.  I did the spicy beef, fish, and carne asada.  Whew, the beef WAS spicy. Very flavorful. The fish tacos were rather bland, and the carne asada was my favorite.  It was the size that threw us. So tiny.  They were the size of the palm of my hand, and I'm little.  I will say that the black beans and rice were delicious. Had I not ate my weight in chips and guac, I wouldn't have been as full.  I also had the pomegranite/grapefruit margarita and it was delicious.  Great balance between sweet and bitter. Yum. The hibiscus margarita was a little too sweet for me, but if you like it on the sweet side.. go for it."}
{"text":"Every time I have visited Blanco the service has been really great. I was recently served lunch by Bain and he was attentive, friendly, and helpful. 5 stars on service! It is also really nice that they have a few longer tables they can put together - good option for large parties.  Food is 4 stars for me, some of the items are a bit heavy for my liking, but I do find it cool that they allow you to mix-and-match tacos to try different ones. And I do loooove the (as another reviewer called it) something-in-it rice. :)   Thanks Blanco!"}
{"text":"Everything was good-not great, just good.  Started with the mango lime daiquiri and couldn't finish it because it gave me a stomach ache. Then had the braised short rib burritos enchilada style, which was pretty salty. The side of corn instead of beans was my favorite."}
{"text":"Had lunch hete while on vacation. Our server was in trainimg with the most delightful training server. I had special dietary needs and they both made insightful perfect suggestions. Our food was delicious!"}
{"text":"Slow cooked bbq pork street tacos, with Blanco rice were awesome. The Mexican street corn were bomb!  I washed it down with the Oaxaca shandy super tasty! The atmosphere was great our server  Paige was awesome and very kind.  The only down side unfortunately was that the bartender couldn't perfect the one drink I requested which was a mojito. But hey that's ok cuz I'm coming back!!  thanks Paige for your awesome service!"}
{"text":"Three star only bc the service was great. My margarita was not good enough to order another. I ordered the guacamole and steak tacos, nothing to rave about. Food was below average. I wouldn't come back here for food or a margarita but the atmosphere was nice. Oh, also the only hot sauce they have is a Tabasco or Choulula. Usually Mexican inspired places have a special house made hot sauce. Way better restos in Scottsdale for tacos and guac."}
{"text":"Our department visited Blanco today for lunch.  Our server, Raymond, was excellent.  He was funny and festive ( the mini Sombrero ).  He kept smiles on our faces everytime he stopped at our table.  He gave excellent recommendations and made sure that we were pleased with our meal.  Definetly five star service.    The food was amazing!    The starter of chips and salsa was great!  The chips were fresh and crispy.  Along with the chips came 2 sauces; a regular salsa and a tomatillo.  Normally I am hesitant to eat tomatillo sauces because they are usually watered down, however that wasn't the case here.  The sauce was fresh and full of flavor.  It was so delicious that a few of my coworkers even asked for more to enjoy it with their meal!  For drinks, I went with Raymond's suggestion of the drink of the day; the Cinnamon Vanilla Margarita.  It was very refreshing as it was the perfect blend of vanilla and cinnamon.  I tried the cheese crisp with avocado.  I thought it was going to be small but it was huge.  It was delicious and flavorful with fresh avocado.  If you love avocado, then you need to give this a try.  It will definetly make your day."}
{"text":"I am going to give this a 5 star based on every aspect of the meal. Our food was off the chart and best Mexican/Tex-Mex I have had in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area yet.  Must, must, must, must try the roasted corn (did I say a must try the roasted corn). This place is amazing - this makes all my other 5 star reviews feel like a four.  I know know what a true five star is!  Again - if in the area you MUST go.  The margaritas are awesome and did I say you must try the corn???  Well done Blanco - we will be back often!!!!"}
{"text":"The Green Chile Pork Enchiladas are amazing. A must have every time I go!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with family.  Sat on the enjoyable patio, music was just right-not too loud, not too quiet.  There are a plethora of Mexican restaurants in the valley and I am always up for trying one out.  This place is good!  It's a new spin on old Mexican classics.  Chips and salsa were a nice start...I ordered a trio of tacos and each one was delicious (BBQ pork was AMAZING)!  I will say the margarita was lacking.  Not too pleased with it for $8.  But I will definitely return for the tacos.  Seriously I can't stop thinking about the yumminess!  And the Mexican Street Corn you can order as a side is out of this world.  Costs $1 extra than just a side of beans.  But totally worth it :)"}
{"text":"This place is fine. Average. Nothing spectacular. But not remotely authentic either, like most of Sam Fox's restaurants. They're all absolutely satisfactory, but if you are looking to be blown away by flavorful and inventive dishes, go somewhere else, cuz it aint gonna happen here.  Went Sunday night for restaurant week with 5 of my friends, and I will say we were blown away by the amount of food they give you for $19 a person. I plowed through my fair share of chips and salsa, which was pretty bland I'll add and was stuffed halfway through my first course.  The decor of the restaurant was cute. I couldn't believe how massive the bar was though! Apparently this is the place to go if you are a tequila drinker. Dozens and dozens of different brands/flavors of tequila. Sadly I am not a tequila so this aspect was entirely wasted on me. I did however have a White Peach & HIbiscus flavored margarita which was sweet but delightful. I would like to point out though that at $9, this margarita cost almost 50% of what my 3 course restaurant week menu did.   Out of all the dishes that I tasted, the tortilla soup was by far the winner of the appetizers, the 3 bites that I could get down of my Shrimp Fajitas were actually pretty tasty, and everyone was pleased with their desserts minus a few moldy raspberries that were thrown on my friend's Tres Leches cake...ick. That said, pretty much the entire restaurant and kitchen staff came over and apologized for said raspberry so the rebound and recovery was nice.  Probably wouldn't go back unless someone else really wanted to and they of course were paying for all of my $9 margaritas, but if you wanted a safe, non-spicy, Scottsdale-version of a Mexican restaurant to take your parents or other out of town guests, this should certainly fit your bill."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here based on the recommendation of the housekeeper at our hotel on a Friday night.  No reservation so we were asked to wait for 20 minutes.   No problem..walked over to the bar and a margaritas later we were ready to be seated.   Got a seat adjacent to the bar and the bartender waited on us.   She did a great job too.  The margaritas were very good -- nice and tart and didn't skimp on the booze.   The salsa and chips was very tasty.   The chips are thick and crunchy and nicely salted.  The salsa is smoky and thick and has nice bite.   We also ordered some guacamole and boy that was delicious!    You get a huge portion.  Very fresh too.  We could have made a meal of that alone.  For entrees I had the shrimp fajitas which I really enjoyed.    They came with corn tortillas and black beans (very good too).   The shrimp were plump and in a spicy sauce.   I liked everything about this meal.  My wife had the fish tacos though and came away disapointed.  Average was her description.    She did love though the flan / fruit she had for dessert.  The servers did a great job too.    We would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere at Blanco, but I really wasn't impressed by the food. I had the ahi tacos and for $13, I could have had a better tacos at a local hole-in-the-wall mexican joint. If you're looking to start your night off with drinks before hitting the town id recommend.  $50 for two entrees and two draft beers, no thanks."}
{"text":"A mixed gathering of \"January\" Birthdays.  About 16 of us were quickly seated. Drinks were a little slow...but there were a bunch of us all at once.  Orders taken.  Here's the issue:  I ordered a Kobe Steak Burrito with NO Pico De Gallo and then reiterated....NO onion, NO tomato, NO Pico.  Waiter asked how I would like it cooked. \" Well Done please\" (being I actually had E Coli about 12 years ago and was hospitalized).   Food comes in a timely manner.  I cut my burrito in half and take a bite. Literally \"raw\".  Im not a BBQ master...so I asked around.  We decided that is was extremely Rare and the opposite of Well Done.  Waiter came and he was upset with the kitchen as he should be. Roughly 5 minutes go by and a lady with dark longer curly hair (I assume a manger) brings another burrito.  Cut it open to investigate....meat is Well Done.... but it is full of Pico and Tomato and Onion.  Same guy waiter takes it back and we asked to not have the cooks spit in are third shot. Ha ha...though we were serious.  Third burrito comes and it is as ordered.  WE THEN GET THE CHECK AND THE BURRITO IS NOT COMP'd NOR DID THEY OFFER A COMP'd BEER, APPETIZER OR GIFT CERT FOR \"Next Time\".  There is no next time.   ....Hmmmmm.  I like Yelp."}
{"text":"I came to Phoenix for a conference at the Biltmore hotel. I found this place on yelp and decided to try it out. It has inside and outside seating. It is happy hour today, starting at 3pm. They give you complimentary nachos and salsa. Chips are homemade and the salsa is ver good.   It has a balance of flavor and bite. There is a separate menu for the happy hour. I had the sparkling sangria that was recommended by the waiter. When I saw it, I thought it was petite. It was not manly enough for me but it turned out pretty good. I tried the Machaca Beef taco and the Crispy Shrimp po boy torta. The taco at first tasted bland but as you eat it you start to feel the tingling of the habanero salsa hitting you. Just an awesome flavor. The torta on the other hand is more of a sandwich. I didn't feel anything from it. All in all, it is a great place to happen by as you shop or stroll by after coming away from a conference day."}
{"text":"My first experience with Blanco was actually at a little one in the airport that I ate at on my way home from Phoenix. I fell in love with my food, especially the rice! Now that I've moved to AZ I make sure to keep Blanco in my restaurant rotation.  The atmosphere is really fun, perfect for date night. Great design, lighting, and layout. The drinks are good and they actually have some really interesting vegetarian options on the menu. Last month I got mushroom tacos that were fabulous!  Being a 20something who works, I tend to eat later than most people and usually my boyfriend and I just go to the bar. The place is often busy so if you want to go around super time don't be surprised if there is a wait.   Just go, order some guac and a marg and enjoy the setting!"}
{"text":"had team dinner here this past wednesday as we wanted somewhere delicious but also be able to watch the nba finals.  this place is just across the street from the camby hotel where half the team was staying - perfect! i've been to blanco before in tucson about a year ago, so i knew this was gonna be just fine.  we all started with their house margarita - delicious! i ended up having like 3 of these hehe.. also got the nachos with short rib, and of course the guac (two orders).  service was a little awkward at the beginning - but the server warmed up after a while and suggested things to do in phoenix during the team we're in town.  for dinner i just had the ceviche which is billed as an appetizer, but portion size was awesome and tasted super fresh.  rest of the team had tacos, and chicken enchiladas, and were really happy with their selections.  legit spot! would come back when in town!"}
{"text":"Blanco Tacos is awesome!! I have been coming here for years. Great food and great service. Austin the bartender is really solid, and the GM Nate does an outstanding job! Short rib and avocado cheese crisp is unbelievable."}
{"text":"I've only been to the one inside the PHX airport; however, I almost considered flying to PHX again just for the chicken burrito. The tortillas are cooked in butter and the chicken has some of the best marinade I've ever tasted. All ingredients for top-quality and their burritos will fill you for the day."}
{"text":"Came here with family to try a new place, and we loved it! Our server, Mike (I think?), was amazingly attentive and had a great attitude. We came with my grandparents, one of whom is in a wheelchair, and it would have been nice is there was more accessible seating. We had to get her into a booth with us, which isn't difficult, but made the difference between a 4 and 5 star review. Accessibility is a huge deal! To be fair, I don't know if this was mentioned when we made the reservation, but the VAST majority of tables were not wheelchair accessible.  On to the food! The chips and salsa came out immediately, and the chips were good, but the salsa was a bit too mild/bland for my preferences. The guacamole was excellent, but came in a smaller dish than I would have expected. I ordered a spicy mango margarita, which was AMAZING. Seriously, everyone, drink this! The crispy shrimp tacos were fabulously perfect. Seriously, I would come back just for this dish. The rice it came with was a bit bland, but acceptable."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that we normally love, but tonight having a waitress that took attitude when the rice and beans were cold (i.e.: we told a girl who seats everyone who approached our waitress who rolled her eyes and then walked off).. not thinking we saw her attitude is the best form of honesty!!! She either is having a bad day or is just like this normally because a prominent past baseball player and his girlfriend also complained about her service as well..... This is not a trigger complaint about Blanca but rather the way things were handled"}
{"text":"Lets start out saying I went here for my BIRTHDAY, that's how much I love this place.  Everything I have gotten from this place has been over the top delicious! Mexican food is my absolute favorite, and they kill it with the beans and rice. I'm starting off talking about the beans and rice because UM HELLO they complement the meal and they totally nailed it.  THE CHIPS AND SALSA ARE SO GOOD I MUST WRITE IN ALL CAPS TO TRULY INFORM YOU, THE READER, ABOUT THEIR GREATNESS.  Now, for things I can suggest to you because sadly I have not been there enough to try the whole menu (but I will some day, mark my words) are...   the roasted chicken tacos and the roasted mushroom tacos are honestly way too good, its probably illegal for me to be talking about such delicious plates on here. ALSO, if you think sometimes soft shell corn tacos are not that great, these ones will totally change your mind about soft shell corn tacos, and your eyes will turn into hearts.  green chili pork enchiladas, where do I even start!!! My boyfriend had ordered them and lets just say I was so full I was about to explode and I still had like four bites because they were absolutely amazing. The meat, the cheese, perfectly stacked (which, in my eyes is the only way enchiladas should ever be) in a hot skillet, and they are sent from the heavens above.   If you are feeling simple and love cheese crisps, they are quite exquisite and not overdone with the cheese so they are not greasy. Super yummy.  THE DESSERTS! Totally worth trying them all, even though you could die due to food consumption overload, they are all very tasty!!!"}
{"text":"I could go on and on forever about this place. Blanco ALWAYS sounds good and truly never disappoints. Last week I went with a few of my closest friends, and although it was definitely not my first time going, it did remind me why I love it so dang much! The service is superb, food and drinks are always on point, and overall it's just the perfect spot for any occasion - even a random Tuesday night out!   To start, well their chips & salsa are incredible. I mean theirs have to be my favorite around. I also recommend their queso blanco for an appetizer. So yummy! For my meal I got tacos. The best part about Blanco is they let you mix and match your tacos! So I chose the carne asada, chicken, and BBQ pork one (so unique, this one is my favorite)! If you're not a huge fan of beans, I recommend getting either the sauteed veggies for your side, or double rice instead! Everything was sooo delicious, and I had the most amazing time catching up with some friends! Blanco is a must try, and definitely my favorite Fox Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, they are super awesome. Overall, the food is super average. If I were to come back it would be solely for the hospitality."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed at this location. I had to fend off gnats throughout my entire meal. When i told the server to please let the Manager know he almost laughed in disbelief.  It was not even acknowledged. Management did not stop by our table and we weren't even asked if we wanted dessert.  I have been there several times and this is the first time this has happened. I was not pleased at all and will not return nor will i recommend it to friends and family.  I don't want a discount or anything, but some acknowledgement would have b en nice."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning from the tortilla soup. So I wouldn't recommend that. Hesitant to recommend anything actually. I was the only one who got SOOO and got sick so my friends made it out okay Waitress could have been more attentive to our waters being out at the table Etc."}
{"text":"Great spot to hit up with friends or if you're flying solo! I love that they have an IPA on draft, and the nachos are by far my favorite must have! Tho, you can't go wrong with any of their delicious salads!"}
{"text":"After driving past this restaurant many times, I convinced my husband to go for happy hour. I am glad we did.  We arrived about 4:30 and the place was about half full. The waiter was extremely helpful and patient since my husband has to ask questions about every menu on the item. The nachos and grilled fish tacos were perfection.  Great food Great service Happy hour pricing cannot be beat By the time we were leaving, the place was packed. If you are interested in trying this place out I would suggest going for happy hour."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times and enjoyed it but we just walked out after waiting 20 minutes for a table while enduring Club Music at level 11 volume. Told they have a DJ on weekend nights. We love this place and usually enjoy the mellow music and food but won't return before calling ahead to find out if there will be ear drum shattering music volume. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"So foxy!! Incredible food!! Great atmosphere! The General Manager Chelsey is incredible and made our party special!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!  What a great night! Thank you Mr. Fox!! Love it!"}
{"text":"We went here during Happy Hour on a Sunday and sat at the bar. We ordered 2 of every HH taco and they were soooo good! The first thing that will catch your eye is their tortillas that look n taste so fresh!!! Our fave tacos were the shredded beef then chicken and last carnitas.  Their churros were also very good, they come with a chocolate sauce, I think just plain were delish. Will definitely come back and try more tacos. Finally service was superb, every single member who worked there treated you like they were happy to see you, which explains why this place is always busy."}
{"text":"We came here with our baby for happy hour. The place was packed.  I liked the setting, reminds me of a large barn with the high beams and giant chandeliers.  There were tables of all kinds, high tops, regular tables, outside patio tables with umbrellas.  I liked the warm queso, torta with shrimp, and torta with manchaca beef.   Good 90s and 2000s jam by the DJ in the corner.  I would come back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Blanco many times for lunch and dinner.  The ambience is super nice... interior decor and openness... the patio super for snacks and drinks with friends during the \"good \" months in Arizona.  One of my favorites is the tortilla soup.  They have changed it up over the past years.. it is less brothy now.  It is very tasty and yummy.  They now have a fun little lunch menu with smaller $3 portions so now you can order a few things from the menu and try a lot of them.  We also had a couple of the tacos and they were delish.  Did I mention the waitresses are super friendly and helpful.... and keep the drinks fresh and coming.  And ... as a side note... the hostesses wear the cutest little dark blue  skirts that are easy on the eyes. :)"}
{"text":"Have been to the restaurant in March and to the grab and go window on April 11m during the outdoor movie.  Love to tacos - nice to have tacos that are fresh and not fried.  Great guacamole / chips and the service comes with a smile."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place! The employees the food, drinks all of it!! It's a really classy place to go for happy drinks and my favorite TACOS!!! I can't wait to tell everyone about this place! I had my ewok backpack that my boyfriend bought me at Disneyland and I was so worried I'd be made fun of lol. The manager actually told his hostess he would give her 3 coins if she could tell him what I was carrying!! She thought it was a football hahaha she was really young! Such a great time!! I took my bf just two days later and had the same wonderful experience! Other places should take note!!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food! I was here for dinner with my family, I had to head to the Apple Store to drop off my phone, during that time my food came out, I wasn't back in a decent amount of time the server had took my plate back to set on the warmer, then they decided to make me a fresh new plate! If that's not great customer service I don't know what is, I'll mos definitely be back, the drinks were pretty good too!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is one of the better Fox Concept restaurants, especially if you go on happy hour. We were waiting for my phone to be repaired so we stopped in for a nibble and drink. I ordered a margarita and shrimp torta, it was a very flavorful little sandwich and I enjoyed my drink. My husband ordered a beer and the dip trio. Individually the dips are just okay, but combining the salsa and guac, or the bean and queso made a huge difference for flavor. Reasonably priced apps and drinks. Worth a shot if you are in the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch and service. We sampled several of the tacos. Delicious and flavorful.  We both loved the salsa!"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible, but the service and ambiance is nothing too special. It is noisy but the decorations are nice. The service was fine. Their guacamole is amazing, so if you like guac I do recommend it. I had their fish tacos, and they were perfect! Just a little kick of spice, and the black beans were great. You get a ton of food for a good price."}
{"text":"Fair try, overall service was just ok but this modern mexican cuisine leaves a lot to ask for. There was good and bad throughout. Salsa came out super cold and bland and did not complement the warm chips well at all.   Their version of guacamole is nothing more than mashed up avocados with lime and salt. We had to ask for extra pico, cilantro, jalape√±os, and added salt and pepper and made our own guac with their ingredients.  We ordered the tacos, well done. I just wish you would give me a small lime wedge so we didn't have to bother the 'runner' yet again. The side of charro beans were a joke. Nothing more than boiled and dried up bland pinto beans, please pass the salt again or pass this place up altogether."}
{"text":"A nice balance between trendy and kid friendly. We arrived around 6pm and were able to get a low table for four outside without waiting. Several other tables had kids and the staff was really great at dealing with them. The food:  - bowl of chips were crunchy and warm - A - I'm not sure why kid quesadilla and taco came with fries. Would prefer beans or rice. Both were fine - B+ - choice of three tacos- crispy shrimp and red chili chicken. Both were good and chicken had a nice kick- A- - fajitas were ok. Again, why no beans and rice? -B+   Biggest disappointment was with the classic margarita. Couldn't taste the tequila and about 75% ice. Overall some minor missteps but I would go back for an enjoyable night out where we felt \"like the cool kids\" even with our own in tow"}
{"text":"The food here is great! I learned about them after they won \"Best Taco\" at a taco festival in Tucson. The first time I went, I ordered their BBQ tacos and they were delicious. I really enjoyed it and had to come back for more! They have a special called 100 days of summer where you can order a la carte tacos, rather than ordering off of the menu and getting 3 of the same kind. It was an awesome deal and I got 4 different kinds."}
{"text":"Blancos is OK. The margs are OK and the tacos are small. The guac is good, queso is very good but makes my stomach hurt, bean dip is no good. They have a decent beer selection. Again the place is OK, there's nothing crazy good about it or nothing horribly bad. The service is a little crappy and the prices are a little higher than the norm. I can make this food at home and it would taste better. Maybe not the queso but I'll let that one slide. :)"}
{"text":"they have great crispy shrimp tacos and great regular hose margaritas as my favorite. It gets real busy in the evening, so probably better with a reservation."}
{"text":"Good restaurant.  I've been here about 3 times.  Nice ambiance and decor.  Service is always good.  The food here is a little meh however.  Tried several different tacos and I find them all a bit bland. Except the BBQ Pork which was excellent.  Taco's aren't bad, just not very flavorful.  The Blanco Burger is good.  It's worth a visit for the drinks though. They are strong and tasty.  This is a nice place to grab a drink and relax before or after dinner but I wouldn't come here hungry."}
{"text":"I meet a client for dinner and drinks. I was greeted by a Hostess who stated it would be a 30-40 minute wait. I wasn't given an option to order drinks or appetizer. Never the less, my client showed up 10 minutes late and we were seated 5 minutes later. It took our servers 5-10 minutes to greet us and order drinks. Our server was training someone that NIGHT. She suggested beef tacos and burrito and I LOVED IT TO DEATH!!! I almost LICKED my plate. drinks were GREAT!! The Chef sent me a few dishes to TRY and it was awesome. SERVICE wasn't the greatest but the FOOD made the difference. I need to get back there soon!!"}
{"text":"Quite honestly, I've never been as enamored by the Fox restaurants as other seem to be. I mean, I like them, and I've never had a bad experience at one, but I just don't go as crazy for them as others seem to.   The first time I went to Blanco Tacos (the Scottsdale location) I didn't like it at all. All I remember was having a bland over-priced quesadilla that left me with no real desire to come back,  Well, a friend from out of town was staying in this area for work so I met them for HH here. Honestly, that might be the reason I had a pretty positive experience. If you knock a few bucks off drinks and apps during the early evening hours I'm generally pretty happy.   I had a couple margs and they were good. Nothing necessarily stood out about them, but they were a little more on the strong side & not real sweet so I was happy.   We split some apps as well. Again, everything was good, but nothing really stood out. We had guacamole & the queso blanco dip. I have to say, I REALLY like the standard salsa they the give you, It has a bit of kick, but is still tasty.   At the end of the day Blanco has a solid HH that I'd come back to. I should note that they are strict about the cut-off time. We ordered a round of margs, like, right after 6 (honestly, I'm pretty sure we got them right at 6) and were charged full price on them. We didn't say anything, and it wasn't a big deal, but I just thought it should be noted."}
{"text":"First time. All of the dishes we got lacked flavor and were consistently dry. Very disappointed. Green chili pork burrito (enchilada style), chicken cheese crisp and carnitas tacos.  Tequila lists were sufficient though."}
{"text":"Food here is a little Americanized but really good. The different flavors of margarita on the rocks are all pretty good.  Appetizers: Nachos Quesadillas Crab and shrimp ceviche  Entrees: Fajitas Chicken mole and vegetable arroz Roasted mushroom tacos  We ordered a few other dishes, and they were all delicious."}
{"text":"So as a true Mexican I can truly say this place isn't your place for burritos and tacos but that's what they sell here. I got the Carne Asada Burrito (Enchilada style) for $14 and I kinna regret it. It was a bit too salty (or maybe I'm just a salty bitch) the chips and salsa was the best part of this dinner. So would I come here and or recommend this NO. It's truly over price but it's an upscale area so enough said. The server was on point with drink refills and checking on our table often and she was super sweet."}
{"text":"Service was prompt, friendly, and efficient. We were given two baskets of fresh chips with salsa before our order arrived.  All selections were fresh, hot, and very tasty.  Five stars isn't high enough!"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful mild Sunday afternoon at the Biltmore and we were looking for a great spot for lunch. The diverse menu and nice patio drew us in so we decided to try out Blanco.  Blanco is what you'd expect of a Mexican restaurant at the Biltmore: stepped up versions of your typical favorites such as burritos, enchiladas, and tacos of course :). We started with the ceviche ($13). It was presented beautifully with a lot of seafood (lump crab and shrimp) and vegetables in a delightful tangy citrus marinade. There were a lot of very roughly chopped, large chunks of vegetables such as cucumber and celery in it though which made it hard to eat with tortilla chips without cutting them into smaller pieces. The largest piece I saw was a 2 inch section of celery. They definitely like everything large and chunky in that ceviche!  I ordered the chicken mole which had a lovely kaleidoscope of colors on my plate from the earthy colored chicken, reddish Spanish rice, and multicolored vegetables topping the plate. The chicken was tender but there were a few bits of gristle in some bites I took, and the mole sauce was good but very sweet compared to other versions I've tried.  Service was attentive and drinks were refilled as needed. Our total for 4 iced teas, one appetizer and 4 entrees was around $85.  Overall it was a pleasant meal and if I'm in the area its a good option for dining."}
{"text":"Think Joyride minus the hipsters. First thing you notice when coming in is the nice layout. Whether you like sitting inside or outside, they have it all.  It is a pretty big restaurant. The chips and salsa were good. Their menu has many options. The burritos here are good. The staff is friendly. They have lots of big TVs which is something I appreciate in a restaurant. Joyride has better food but this place has a better restaurant. If only they could take the best of both. I would go back."}
{"text":"Loved the drinks, cheese enchilada was killer, the sides were killer and guacamole was divine."}
{"text":"Blanco Tacos + Tequila hood the bar extremely high when it comes to fresh Mexican food, today was my  6-7th time at this location and it has never disappointed. We had just missed the lunch rush so we were seated immediately though we've never had more than a 5 minute wait or we'll just sit at the bar.  For appetizers we order the quesadilla which comes with a large scoop of fresh guacamole and pico on top of thin and crispy queso pie! Yum.. We also ordered the Warm Queso \"Bob Armstrong Style\" which adds to our queso addiction, just pour that on all you ordered, you'll be great. Entree included the Mahi Mahi and Tiger Shrimp Fajitas which was a generous portion and FINGER LICKING GOOD.  It's almost a win/lose because at the time your rating it's a win and when you leave and return home it's a lose because you wish you were still at Blanco eating. ha! Truuu though!  To wash it down we drank the house margarita, I flavored mine with Hibiscus and chugged that baby down! Bottoms up!  The cherry on top was the churros... ahhhh warm bite size and melted chocolate on the side.  Big thank you to the EXCELLENT staff with the sweetest customer service, always has been 5 stars!"}
{"text":"This place was nice.  Food had good flavor good atmosphere as well.  Didn't try the tacos. Had a burrito.  I don't think it was worth 14 though.  Close but not quite.  Black beans are awesome.   Tried the white peach and hibiscus marg. GROSS. Tasted like I was drinking a flower.  Waaaaay to much hibiscus not enough white peach.  Took a while to get the flower taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Came in and got seated right away by the manager he great, was hoping to get a seat by the bar because the bearded bartend is super cute ;) we got a booth in the corner it was perfect. Our server was Calvin and let me tell ya he sure was something. Best service I've ever had. After only an hour spent at that table I feel like we became brothas.  Love it totally I'm going to be coming  3 times a week for sure!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what you get. I literally did not know that tacos could be made as small as they make them here. And a $5 taco at that. Sheesh.   Head down to 16th st and get some real tacos for 20% of the cost"}
{"text":"Guess this just is not my kind of place. Concept resto and I don't get the concept. Food marginal. Drinks worse. Won't be back"}
{"text":"What a great, unique, hip restaurant. A flavor packed spin on traditional Mexican food. Pleasantly surprised. Everything was fresh. The staff was wonderful. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Nice handsome restaurant!  Stopped in around 9pm for a bite and a beer..never been before.  Cruising up Scottsdale road and the big blue sign drew me in.  Service was good... the young gentleman that waited on us was attentive and very helpful.  Tried the Tuna Ceviche...it was ok. Had the cheese enchiladas..( I know, who orders a cheese enchilada?)...but, I have been to some restaurants in CA that make cheese enchilada's to die for..this one not so much...they were burnt on top, they put more cheese and sauce on to cover it up, they were dry and drowning in sauce.    Oh well, next time I will order something else...nice tequila menu though, and I like tequila!  Looks like this will be a happy hour, chips, salsa and tequila place for me!"}
{"text":"While in Arizona, I thought it was appropriate to get at least some kind of Mexican food. Blanco happened to be just down the street from our resort so we decided to check it out for dinner.   Glad I read up on some reviews and signed up in time for $10 off email. With most of the entrees priced in mid teens, $10 off was a generous offer.   I debated for a while if I should balance my ginormous burger diet (earlier lunch) with some greens. But after learning Blanco was famous for their skillet enchiladas - I caved and ordered their chicken while my husband opted for their short ribs.   Both their enchiladas were beyond delicious. There was actually very little tortilla - just a thin layer on top, stuffed mainly of proteins and cheese. Actually reminded us more of a lasagna. Loved that they cooked it in a skillet because it kept the cheese bubbly, warm, and gooey. Not the most waistline friendly meal but no regrets!   Overall - def worth checking out when in Az!"}
{"text":"My waitress Jody was very sweet and attentive. My food was ok. I ordered three tacos, two pork and one braised beef. I told her that I was allergic to dairy. No cheese on my tacos or guacamole. Unfortunately my guacamole came with cheese on it anyway. The braised beef taco was wonderful, the pork didn't have a lot of flavor. The guacamole helped make it better. I really like this restaurant, and I will be back."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night around 8pm and had to wait about 15-20 min. Our server was very attentive and checked in on our table multiple times throughout the dinner, refilling waters and asking if we needed anything. We ordered, and the food arrived relatively quickly.  We ordered the Nachos con Queso Blanco with Short Rib and honestly it was one of the best loaded Nachos my friends and I have ever had. Each layer of the nachos had cheese, meat, beans, everything very well mixed throughout the entire pile which is unlike the typical Nachos where there is stuff on top and just chips underneath. The cheese was so creamy and satisfying. The short rib was amazing as well, very tender and perfectly seasoned. I shared this with 2 other people and we were pretty full from this alone.  We each also ordered the tacos where you could mix and match for a total of 3 tacos per order. I ordered the crispy shrimp, slow cooked bar-b-q pork, and the carne asada. It came with rice and beans and a choice of flour or corn tortilla.  The shrimp taco tasted good but I may have not eaten it right away but it definitely wasn't crispy. I wouldn't say there was anything particularly special about it.  The slow cooked bar-b-pork was the \"award winning\" taco and the word that came to mind after eating it was \"interesting\". The meat was very tender and juicy and sweet but it was an interesting combination to put BBQ flavored meat in a taco. I guess it just wasn't what I expected but still good.  There wasn't anything special about the carne asada taco, it was a little bland to me actually so I took some of the short rib from the Nachos and added it to my taco and it was amazing.  My friend actually ordered the short rib taco and that was probably the best one.  The atmosphere was very trendy and hip like many places in Scottsdale. The servers also had an interesting uniform, very formal on top but casual on the bottom. A true semi-formal/semi-casual look.   Overall I think this place had amazing Nachos and short rib and I believe there are many other things that are great on their menu that we didn't get to try. Might come back and actually try their tequila drinks as well."}
{"text":"Talk with Blanco Rep and they not only apologized but sent a Gift card.....still one of my Favorite places!"}
{"text":"I've only been in town 6 weeks and I've been here twice. The first was a 5 star experience. The second was a bit less impressive from 5he service perspective. Both times, however, the food and drinks were very good. The grilled Mahi fajitas and the Italian Blood Orange margaritas will be staples in my Scottsdale life :)"}
{"text":"We went to Blanco last night fir dinner and the entire experience was not an example of a Fox Concept evening.  Our waitress was slow, not organized, forgot to refill chips, didn't bring refills, and couldn't answer our questions.  It took forever to get our food and when it came we were served fish tacos not avocado tacos.   The waitress took the tacos back and had them replaced.  They eventually came on another plate.  The manager or someone done by and apologized but the whole experience was just bad.    The good wasn't well executed, not hit, didn't seem fresh and no one tried to make it right.    I won't be back."}
{"text":"Super nice. Go there often for lunch and had always been good experiences. The staff is very efficient , the food is awesome and the restaurante is very clean .... :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was very good. We were starving and didn't want to wait too long to eat, and we didn't have to. Our waitress was quick and very friendly, offering suggestions for what was best on the menu. The portions looked small at first when we sat down, but they were actually very filling. It was a little on the pricy side for poor college students like ourselves, but that was more our own faults. Other than that, everything was great. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"10 of us literally walked out of the restaurant after we ordered and was berated by manager Brad Sowery. On what looked like a very slow night 2 of us arrived early and had to interrupt the bartender from talking to a friend to get a drink. We all sat, ordered drinks and this mgr came over and said he was letting us know ahead that he wouldn't allow us to have more than one drink because he thought we didn't need more. He talked to us ladies about our body weight, that we don't look like we can handle alcohol, continuously insulting us. We wanted to order food but he continued to lecture. The average age was 50, we were having fun and enjoying each other's company like the only other two tables in the restaurant. Horrible manager=horrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food and experience here. Margaritas are to die for and the Cheese Crisps were so good."}
{"text":"We went here for an after work party one evening and the atmosphere and bar were really cool. The scene is pretty busy but the bar wasn't super busy since work just got out. We had about a dozen people and got served rather quickly. The appetizers were very good. The selection of beers was not great but a lot of Mexican restaurants and bars do not have a ton of beer. Overall, it was a great experience and I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here with my manager last night and saddled up at the bar for dinner and drinks. The bartender that was helping us was super friendly and helpful. We wanted to start off with a shot and she walked us through the different types of tequila and we had a shot of the Casamigos blanco and tasted the same line in reposado. You can definitely taste the difference and this would be a great spot to do some tasting.   We started off with the chips & salsa they brought out and added guacamole and the fresh seafood ceviche. All of which were okay. The guac wasn't anything extraordinary, I could have done with some heat and salt. The ceviche was sweeter than your typical fare and also super chunky, which I wasn't a fan of. I had a hard time deciding on an entree, but you can mix and match tacos so I tried the baja chicken, carne asada, and bbq pork tacos, all of which I enjoyed. I had a mix of the black and charro beans, and the rice was okay.   The star of the night was the white peach & hibiscus margarita which I would have drank by the gallon. It's very sweet so if that's not your style don't get it, but it tasted like sweet alcoholic candy :)  It's a cool spot, nice location, I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and I really liked my Fish tacos. They were very good and tasty. Chips are good as well as the salsa. Beer is good. Place is very crowded on the weekends and parking is not easy. You may need to valet. Good music and a bit loud. Difficult to hear. Service was good. Will return."}
{"text":"I am sorry, but did it say that Blanco serves Mexican food?  This is a disgrace. Lets just start by saying that my experience here was less than mediocre.  I usually find one thing wrong with a place and still give 4 stars.  This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.  (The hostess was the other 10%...very unpleasant...like I was bothering her to get seated....honey that is your JOB!) I met my lovely friend Karla for lunch...she recommended the place and I have been wanting to try it.  We both ordered the chicken tortilla soup to start and I ordered also the enchiladas with green chiles.  The chicken tortilla soup was a catastrophe.  It was made with chicken broth with every vegetable you can think of, chicken, and WHOLE tortillas.  The tortillas were a soggy mess and the soup was just G-d awful.  The server (who was nice) had the manager come over and take it off my bill.  (Which was nice.)  The manager even said that my soup looked very unappetizing.  Next was the enchiladas...first...I didn't know that enchiladas were supposed to be HARD and CRUNCHY!!!  It was greasy, the cheese was flat out disgusting...and they even put my green chiles on the side when I did ask them to put them in the enchiladas. (Which shouldn't be too hard) And on top of everything else, my rice was BUTTERED WHITE RICE!!!!  In a Mexican style Restaurant?  Are you kidding me?  And it was so unappealing...(this meal I had to pay for...)  There was no Mexican flavor or feel at all in this restaurant.  Very displeased and have no desire to ever step foot in there ever again."}
{"text":"National Margarita Day! What a better place than this to celebrate. My dining partner and I took advantage of the $6 Classic Margaritas for lunch. Our server Steven was great, very informative especially being our first time their. They do have slightly different twist on some dishes in preparation that I was glad he informed us.  Of course we started with Margaritas which came with Salsa and Chips. We ordered a small Guacamole while perusing the menu. Great menu selections. We ordered the Chipotle Shrimp Tacos which came with Beans and Rice and The Green Chili Pork Burrito with a side of the red and Green Sauce that came with Rice. All the food came out hot and tasted great! Loved this place!  Atmosphere: bright and airy, Service: excellent, Food: very good. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Just ate there for first time with a good friend visiting from out of town. We sat at a high top in the bar area to catch up, and to watch a little of the Denver game. Dyana was our waitress, and she (and the whole experience) was Awesome. Her recommendations were excellent, service was fast, and she was totally accommodating. We started with the ceviche and pitcher of sangria, had an assortment of tacos, and finished with the flan. GET THE FLAN :). I live in the East Valley but if I'm ever near the Biltmore, I'll be heading here for sure."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with co-workers. The decor is pretty out dated and the blue chairs had cracking and torn vinyl and weren't very comfortable. I'm not sure why but halfway through lunch they opened the doors and left them open, flies started buzzing around our food and table.  Their food is typical Arizona Mexican food with bland flavor and no authenticity. If you are looking for a Mexican dining experience this isn't the place. We started off with guacamole, chips and salsa. The guacamole was tasteless and didn't have enough cilantro, onions or tomatoes it also didn't have any chopped serranos/jalapenos plus it needed salt. I ordered the carne asada tacos which had very dry corn tortillas, they had to be at least a few days old and left out uncovered. The meat was dry, a little chewy and lacked in flavor as well. The butter rice was good and the bean were good but lets be honest how can you mess those up."}
{"text":"Super trendy. Very modern. This fun Mexican joint is perfect for a get together. Their margaritas are delicious and the food is awesome. They take celiac very seriously and the staff is very knowledgable about the procedures and ingredients. The ambience is upbeat and welcoming. I recommend stopping by for a drink and some tacos!"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Food came out quick. Free chips & salsa (salsa was delicious & had a nice kick to it). I had the Baja chicken tacos. They were great, and OML the blanco rice was soooo delicious. My bf ordered the shrimp & chicken fajitas and there was more than enough for him (& he has a big appetite) he was impressed with the shrimp."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and the fajitas are good. I enjoy their salsa and blended margaritas. Make a reservation (open table) because it gets busy!"}
{"text":"Love me some Blanco. Have since 2006 and nothing has changed! Other than trying this location a few times, I like consistency of the recipes from each space but the Tucson, La Encantada spot is my absolute favorite.   For this location, the back patio isn't as nice as it right in the parking lot but the service is just as friendly and the food just as delicious.   Happy Hour options are pretty nice too, but, they conveniently left my favorite blood orange marg off that discounted menu, would love to see that on it next time!   Keep it up Blanco, you are a staple of AZ and I look forward to dining with you every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for dinner with friends, Love the guacamole and chips. The soft tacos are hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Disappointing meal. Mostly bland and boring considering all the excellent Mexican food around scottsdale don't bother. The only thing worth ordering was some sort of flatbread type pizza that had the only tasty flavor that night. Cute restaurant but definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Not just a salad. The Mexican chop salad was muy bueno! I added chicken and requested dressing on the side. There was no need for dressing at all. The salad is full of corn, black beans, guacamole, pico de gallo and other delicious goodness. I was a member of the clean plate club. I also recommend the hibiscus green iced tea. Is was awesome! I'll be going back to Blancos. Need to try the tacos and margaritas."}
{"text":"Incredible food especially the street corn. The  music was a little loud if you don't like that kind of thing, however it was perfect for us. The guac was really good too and they give you chips and salsa as soon as you sit down. Great spot."}
{"text":"I am a self professed Sam Fox groupie. Every restaurant I have been to by him, I have loved. Blanco did not disappoint. I came with a group of 7 girls on Saturday night, and while they told us 35 to 40 min wait, it was only about 15. Score! We shared 2 bowls of guacamole which was delish. The chips were addictive, I told myself I wouldn't have any but these were better than any I had ever had. I had the roasted chicken, green Chile pork, and shredded tacos combo. Roasted chicken was my favorite. The rice packed a lot of flavor, and the beans were so-so. I enjoyed the Paloma cocktail. Yes the tacos were small, but the rice and beans were generous and I left feeling quite full. Sam Fox has yet to disappoint!"}
{"text":"We both had burritos, full of meat & beans. Server kept our glasses full and checked on us frequently!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nice, casual place for drinks and app's, this would probably work well. As a restaurant, it does not work. The food was flavorless and bland. The tuna ceviche may have been the worst I have ever eaten.  The only thing you could taste in the fish tacos was the corn tortilla. No spices, no cilantro, no spice, no flavor. The music was just loud enough where you could not really have a decent conversation if you were sitting inside. Overall, drinks on the patio would be the only reason I would go back."}
{"text":"Vibrant lively restaurant with a flow of great seating arrangements within the bar area. We went on a Saturday evening for a quick dinner and drink.  Once we were seated, we were served immediately with a bowl of chips and salsa and water to drink while deciding on our drink order. I really liked the salsa. It wasn't as spicy as I would like but I did like the savory garlicky flavorful taste of the salsa.   I got the Jalape√±o margarita and hubs got patron on the rocks. Drink prices were not too bad and the pour was nice.  We got a mix match of the tacos and were able to sample six different types. I was definitely a fan of the green chili pork and the slow cooked bbq pork. Wasn't a big fan of the fish tacos and the short rib. Having said that, everything overall was good and service was great. Our drinks were filled at all times and the servers were helpful and friendly.   Hubs and I will be back, we loved the vibe of the place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Extremely fun environment.  At night there is a DJ so it makes for a fun drinking environment. They have delicious margaritas and really great nachos. The tacos are great but I recommend making your own type of burrito with shrimp it's awesome. They have great queso and salsas. The patio outside is amazing but hard to get on because it's so great."}
{"text":"It's been three hours since I ate Blanco and I'm still so full. It was my first time there and I can't wait to go back. I had the chips as an appetizer with salsa, mildly spiced, and delicious queso, also quite mild. The guacamole was good- although I do prefer to have it a little spicier. For my main course I had the beef enchiladas with braised short rib. It came out with an authentic Mexican presentation in a hot skillet. I had it with a side of their rice and street corn. Wow that stuff is seriously addicting. I only ate half of everything because I was beyond full. The sangria wasn't the best I've ever had but definitely added a nice touch to the meal. Can't wait to go back and try more....after I finish these leftovers!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm!  I live in the Dallas/Ft. Worth Texas so I have access to a lot of Tex/Mex as well as authentic Mexican food.  I accidentally stumbled upon Blanco & so glad I did!  Their tacos are good, but I can't really go further than that.  What I can tell you is that the skillet enchilada was quite possibly THE BEST enchilada I've ever had!!!    So...the kicker is that I was at the airport the very next morning and I saw that Blanco is at the airport.  Yessssssss! Now, in my mind, I did say to myself, \"Self, you just had Blanco for dinner last night.\"  Then myself responded, \"But it's breakfast...\" so I ordered."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere! Nice outside seating. Love their tacos (the shrimp are my favorite). Good margaritas."}
{"text":"I enjoy the outdoor patio so much at Blanco and they have lovely service at this restaurant with hostess, bartenders and wait staff. Always very personable, organized and polite.  We enjoyed the Albarino wine last Friday night and the atmosphere was so nice and very much date night. Good place for couples to enjoy nice dinner with smooth operations even when super busy!"}
{"text":"Very nice place for new spins on the traditional Mexican dishes. A little pricey, but well worth it. If you leave hungry, you must have been starving!"}
{"text":"Another good Sam Fox restaurant.  I think the vibe is cool here, food is good, and service is great.  It's not necessarily a place i crave, but it's consistently good.  Good job on the uniforms!  Food: 3 Service: 5 Ambiance: 4"}
{"text":"Purposely logged into Yelp after about a year of not using it just to say how amazing my experience here was! I accidentally left some jewelry on my table that was of value to me. Harry, the manager here, went above and beyond to locate what I had lost and get it back to me. I could not be more appreciate of how on top of this he was, and how quick he was to call me back! That sort of service is hard to come by, and I am so thankful to him! Someone, give this man a large Christmas bonus.   Not to mention, the meal was amazing, as it always is. Can't ever go wrong eating here, and after this amazing experience, I will always select this Fox restaurant over any other one!"}
{"text":"My wife & I love this place. We have earl ten here many times (we just moved out of Arizona).   I get the Burritos(steak or chicken) and my wife loves a few of the salads.  I knock off one star because I am slightly disappointed in their lack of alcohol selections.   Oh yes, their white rice is amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. When I fly in I'm sure to eat there every time. Their shrimp tacos are all different yet perfect. They will mix and match tacos so you can order one of each. The Friend shrimp are pan seared, crispy and fresh. The avocado and cabbage keeps it light. Chips and salsa are hearty and flavorful. Rice is a flavor of its own and not your typical Spanish rice. Fun hip vibe and their tequila selection is spot on!"}
{"text":"the decor in this place is great!  I loved the wood and blue contrast and the open kitchen!   Very nice Patio and comfortable seating throughout.  The service at first was slow but then recovered after drinks.  We started with White sangria and that was interesting.  Perfect drink for a hot day!  the chips and Salsa were very very good.  The salsa had just the right amount of heat and Sweetness.  The menu looks great and I waned to try everything!  The burrito my friend got was gigantic!  I had the grilled fish tacos and they were pretty good but lacked the flavor i was craving.  I would come back here for drinks and dinner .  Value... meh.... this is pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"I have been here twice so far for lunch The first time was very unremarkable I had a taco and the shell was hard and the meat wasn't anything to write home about  The chips & salsa weren't great as well   My first visit really wasn't what I expected  However   My second time went very well We were seated on arrival and our server was very prompt  We received water as well as chips & salsa within seconds of sitting down... I wanted to try one of their margs and our wonderful server suggested the watermelon rhubarb one so I took her advice  After looking at the menu I decided on the award winning BBQ pork tacos with rice and beans  The tacos and beans were wonderful I should've asked what kind of rice it was going to be as I am not a big fan of creamy rice... I left that on the plate... And devoured everything else...  The margarita was tasty and really hit the spot because it was about 109 that day and I needed something to cool me off  The flavor of watermelon and hint of lime was excellent...  All in all I enjoyed Blanco and look forward to visiting again perhaps at the Biltmore location...   Thank you to the wonderful server for making this visit enjoyable and resurrecting"}
{"text":"This place was great. Really good food and amazing service. We had an issue with one of the meals but they handled it so well (these things happen). The manager came over and brought out fresh food along with comping our drinks. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our server Emerald was amazing! Starters she wished my mom and wife a happy Mother's Day which i thought was thoughtful and respectful! She made sure our drinks came out quick and let us know about the prickly pear margarita special!! They were amazing! When i ordered the shrimp tacos i forgot to say no mayo, so when they came i felt bad. Emerald told me it wouldn't be a problem to remake them without mayo and even offered me a appetizer while i waited for the new tacos. She was really a great server so did your going here make sure to ask for her!!!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was Penelope Cruz or her doppelg√§nger.  Penelope made some recommendations. Me? I ordered the Green Chile burrito (not on her list of recommendations). While the burrito was very tasty, perhaps a bit on the heavy side for lunch, the fresh-looking tacos that were served up at my table for my companions looked sooo yummy. I only ate half of the burrito and learned you want to listen to the recommendations from Penelope!  The chips and salsa were yummy. If you decide to order the burrito (even when Penelope is recommending something else), don't eat all the chips and salsa first, leave room for the main entree.  Plenty of inside and outside seating. We opted for outside as the weather was perfect.  I'll definitely come here again, but I'm listening to Penelope next time! She knows her food."}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite restaurant in AZ! It's always such a treat. They have the freshest tasting salsa that comes complimentary with your meal. I love the carne Asada tacos and their rice is to die for! It is so buttery and delish! The sangria is also amazing! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is really good and we love the decor and atmosphere. They actually had a live DJ which we didn't notice until we were done with our food. The drinks and tacos were definitely good and we'll be back here for sure.   The only reason I give it 4-stars is because I can't remember how good the food was. It was good, but was it really good? Usually if it's really good I write a review instantly. However, 4-stars is good enough for us to continue coming back... we might eat here tonight now that they're on my mind. Hmm..."}
{"text":"There is nothing better than cooling off at Blanco's after a melting hot day in the Phoenix sun. This place is awesome and it only gets better as the evening progresses. Let's start at Happy Hour. So many fun drinks and appetizers.  I like Sangrias, which is on the Happy Hour menu. My husband gets the blood orange margarita, which is not on the Happy Hour Menu. We also ordered Happy Hour Nachos. They were small, but enough for 2. For dinner I ordered the chili verde burrito enchilada style. It was a lot of food. My husband ordered tres tacos without beans or rice. He got three different flavors, crispy shrimp, carnitas and carne asada. The drinks were great. The food was great. We were so full we had to take a small walk in the shouldering heat. You know I will be back."}
{"text":"Came to Blanco Tacos during Restaurant Week 2009. The guacamole they served with the chips was so yummy! The flan was also delicious. I will come back just to eat the flan!   The scene was pretty cool. Fun people watching environment."}
{"text":"This place really over rated paid 20 and food  was terrible. And I went with two coworker and they didn't like their food either. I had the steak fajitas and my friends had the cheese enchiladas which she return and then got the cheese crisp."}
{"text":"Blanco use to be one of my fav spots. I started going to the one at Biltmore often then switched to the Scottsdale location when I moved. Lately the service has been bad and food has joined. I'm not sure what has happened but the last time I was in the Scottsdale location it smelled like dog poop, the bartender chicks had bad attitudes and service was bad and food was less than mediocre. I gave them a 3 because they use to be solid but today Blanco deserves a 2. I hope they pull it together or it will be off my list. The short rib tacos are the fav when done right..."}
{"text":"The ambience was superb! I ordered the Chicken Mole.  It was so salty that I could only take a couple of bites.  My husband ordered the Taquitos which had no flavor.  The service was mediocre.  Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Another great Fox Restaurant - Blanco has really good tacos, salads, and appetizers. I was bummed when they stopped serving my favorite menu item, the Ahi Tacos, but the grilled fish tacos are a good back-up choice. If you're not that hungry, you can split the tacos and they will bring 4 mini tacos instead of three (so two each) and a smaller portion of the side dishes.   The tortilla soup is also one of my favorite things to order on cooler days.  And it's really good if you add avocado to the soup!"}
{"text":"This is a great atmosphere. More of a modern Mexican food that is delicious. A great place to go and grab drinks while sitting on the patio or a great dinner spot to watch a game, hang out with friends, or simply grab a bit after a long day."}
{"text":"We went to Blanco's recently and showed up at 6:15pm.  Got a pager and was told it would take 25 minutes.  Since the bar was full we went across to J Alexander's for drinks (awesome bar).  5 minutes later we get paged.  The rest of our party isn't here yet.  The hostess states that just come back and we'll put you at the top.  We do come back and well we are put at the bottom of the list and don't sit until 8:00 pm.  My patience only goes so far, and fortunately the manager was very accomodating and took a good chunk off our meal.  The food and service were exceptional, but waiting 2 hrs for a table when there were other open tables wasn't.  And yes, there was a significant amount of the pretentious crowd.  I originally thought our neglect was racial in nature.  If the food and service wasn't as good, the rating would've fallen significantly."}
{"text":"We went to Blanco on a Saturday around 11:30 for lunch. The place was jam packed! If it isn't a scorcher outside, find a shady spot on the patio- the cushioned patio furniture is super comfy and the misters make the heat a little more tolerable.   Definitely have the guacamole! It's fresh and flavorful and a good accompaniment to the chips and salsa. The cheese crisps are a must- kind of a Mexican flatbread the size of a medium pizza. The street tacos were good- tiny, but good! Several unique drink options are on the menu. The mixed berry marg seemed to be the crowd favorite. Give Blanco a shot if you're in the mood for Mexican!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch while staying at the nearby Andaz resort.  What a great local Mexican place!  Really lively atmosphere, good food, and awesome service at the bar.  The skinny margarita is super refreshing. Loved the tacos especially the \"world famous\" BBQ pork tacos and the shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"I rarely leave reviews but this time it's warranted. 2 guys were sitting at the bar n I'm assuming she was one of the managers but she was behind the bar helping the bartender. These guys were a holes to her. Very rude and snippy. She interacted in a very brief exchange with us. Not even a minute into it these guys interrupted snapping at her for a water. She apologized and was very civil but they continued to berate her. Kudos to her for keeping her cool n a smile on her face."}
{"text":"Good fish tacos, good margaritas, good guac, friendly service - what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love Roberto--he's the best!! The beers were frosty and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS BLOOD ORANGE MARGARITA! A little on the sweet side, but so good. The bartender was attentive and nice, even while he had a full bar and restaurant to attend to. Hostess was super nice and friendly. Great decor, free chips and salsa! Does that even happen anywhere else in Scottsdale? We split the Short Rib and Avocado Cheese Crisp and it was so yummy. Us two girls wanted a light lunch and were actually stuffed and couldn't even finish it.   I will definitely have to make it back at night to sit outside and for happy hour! Great FOX concept!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous experience here. The open air restaurant was exactly what the 6 of us were looking for. The atmosphere was casual, the service excellent, and the food and drinks were fantastic! We had several different flavors of margaritas, a michelada, tuna ceviche, queso flameado, and taco entrees - all of it great. I am very surprised to see the less than stellar reviews here. It also didn't hurt that the waiters were quite attractive."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a really great choice for any person. The service is super kind. I would recommend this to everyone. My children are \"picky\" but they approved that this place is really good!!!!   Jesse was our waiter and was super great!"}
{"text":"This place always fun. I enjoy  the food. A cocktail or two.  I usually never write a review, but on Monday I was in Blanco and I have to say. It was such a joy to have Denver as our server. He has been there a while and we are alway happy to have him as our server.  Sometimes I feel you have to let people know when they are doing a good job. After seeing him on many occasions.  I thought i would let you ( Blanco)know.  Thanks For the great the great food and service."}
{"text":"Great fish tacos & margaritas. Americanized version of Mexican food, but good & really friendly staff."}
{"text":"I would have given ZERO stars if it was possible. Terrible customer service, rude and not happy to help customers. The whole restaurant was served water in a class cup for some apparent reason my family's table was served all in a plastic to go cup like kids. When asked about situation they claimed their dishwasher wasn't working. If he noticed right behind him there are stacks of trays with clean cups. Don't stand there and lie straight to customer when your waiters  didn't want to treat us like any other guest. She not once said positive but only give our water and than saw her again only when we are about done so she can bring the check. No kind actions or not even a single smile to our table by any waiters. This is one of the worst experience I had at a restaurant.   Learn to work on your customer service skills and treat everyone the same."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last night for the first time and it was amazing! The food was delicious and service was great!! Will go back again soon for their green chile pork enchiladas!!"}
{"text":"This bad review is not for the food. It was fine and the drinks were great. We went to the bar area to watch the NCAA tournament and got there 30 minutes early to get a good seat. 5 minutes into the game the bartender changed the channel to baseball when we had our food and drinks at the table. We talked to the manager and let him know we had gotten there early to watch the game. He said he was sorry but a couple came in to watch the baseball game and he could move us. What??   It was unbelievable. How do you change the channel of the NCAA championship to another channel when 3 customers have been watching the same channel for one hour??   The manager said no and basically said \"too bad\". Needless to say, we won't be back.   Place right next to it is incredible though! Zinburger!"}
{"text":"Blanco is totally adequate for Tex-Mex.   I didn't want a full dinner, so I ate at the bar and really enjoyed their house margarita ($8.50) - you can really taste the fresh lime and it was a decent size. Definitely one of the better margaritas I've had. I also liked their house salsa - just a bit of heat, a great consistency and very fresh tasting.  To nibble on, I ordered queso fundido which I didn't really care for. They add chorizo, but the sausage really needed to be drained off as it left a TON of oil which was pretty gross. (Yes, I do realize the irony of someone who decided to eat melted cheese for dinner complaining about oil...) There were also way, way too many sweet peppers in there for me personally - those weren't listed on the menu BTW.  I also had a small guac and loved it - clearly fresh made, and full of big avocado chunks. I probably should have ordered this alone. Service was pleasant and the prices are reasonable. If you're looking for tasty Mexican in a nice atmosphere, Blanco is a good option."}
{"text":"Blanco is a great restaurant for a date night or dinner with friends.  To start, the chips and salsa are great and the margaritas are always spot on (not too sugary/sweet).  I really like their fish tacos, which are fresh and light yet definitely leave you satisfied (just not weighed down).  I've also tried their chicken tortilla soup, it was great (I just don't eat soup very often due to the warm weather).  You really can't go wrong with any of the Fox Restaurants!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and everything is excellent. The Blood orange margarita are my favorite drink. The enchiladas are layered and not rolled. Very tasty"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour.  Best Cesar Salad in town.  Love the fresh welcoming decor.  Service is top shelf and friendly.  This is a definite stop and savor!"}
{"text":"From the minute we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess. I informed her we had a reservation booked through Open Table. Without looking up anything...\"Mrs. Friedman, we have your table for 2 waiting for you!\" I do believe my jaw hit the floor...  Our Server, Sanders, greeted us promptly, got our beverage orders. We explained we had never been there before. He took a genuine interest in explaining the menu, answering questions, etc.The gal I was with needs Gluten free items, so he was very helpful to point her in the right direction. Sanders delivered some of the most exceptional service I have ever experienced in a restaurant. Well Done!   No surprise everything was served hot, fresh and delicious! Everything that was needed to enjoy the meal was brought to the table promptly, smiles galore and lots of thank yous by all that assisted in making our experience exceptional.   The Manager was on the floor assisting the wait staff. The restaurant was extremely busy. He did visit our table where we had the chance to tell him about our experience. Loved that he was out and about and available.   If you are in the area...This restaurant would be a great choice!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and everything was so good! The Mexican chopped salad is great and the servers were very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm starting to think that Phoenix isn't the Mexican food mecca that people seem to think it is. My favorite place closed down over a year ago, and I've since then been on the search for something comparable. I've yet to find anything that comes even close.   Taste is very subjective, yet most people get quite defensive about their favorite Mexican place. I'm pretty sure this place won't go on the top of many people's lists though. It's not like I thought for even a second that Blanco would blow my mind, but I wasn't paying and since it was a Fox Concept (which is the new way of saying \"chain\" I guess) I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I tend to order pretty much the same thing when I hit a new Mexican joint, and I didn't stray from that this time. I like to get a cheese crisp... I know it's totally not authentic, but my mom used to make them when I was a kid. Their version of a cheese crisp was good... even less Mexican than most places, but good. Interesting type of cheese... fresh and light and not oily.  Their salsa was kinda weak, but tasted okay. It needs more flavor and more heat, but it didn't taste bad like some places. I ordered a machaca beef taco dish as well. The beef was boring and flavorless, but quality meat. Their margaritas were okay... nothing to write home about, but at least they didn't taste like a store bought mix.   The food was merely okay - at least it was edible. It's not very Mexican at all, but it's decent. The things that stands out about this place are that it's very clean and nice inside, and the staff is super friendly and good looking. It's almost to the point that I want to give it 4 stars. If the food wasn't so bland and uninspired, it would be an easy decision. I may change it later. At least I didn't go home with gut rot. I'll eat here again."}
{"text":"I have been to Blanco several times. Everything about it is good, and nothing is extraordinary. The atmosphere is open and can be a bit loud. The food is consistent. I have not sat at the bar, which is open and looks fun.  They have a wide variety of tequilas.  It's all about what you are looking for.  Blanco is a pleasant experience but not the first place on my list for great Mexican food in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here, I took my wife out for date night and we were looking forward to trying this restaurant. We ordered the salad with fresh grilled Mahi-Mahi and it was excellent. Then we ordered a chicken poblano cheese crisp. The cheese crisp was good but the chicken was a bit bland. I had ordered a carne asada burrito enchilada style with green sauce.  This is where things started to go not so good. They had delivered the salad and cheese crisp fairly quickly but the burrito was not so quick. After waiting for more than 20 minutes for the burrito I had ordered it was finally delivered but with red sauce, not green sauce, which is what I ordered. By this time I was pretty full from the salad, cheese crisp and the chips and salsa, which were also pretty good, so I ended up sending the burrito back.  Although there were some issues with our dinner the service was absolutely amazing, our server was excellent and he management ended up taking great care of us. We are hoping to try this restaurant again and I am looking forward to updating my review."}
{"text":"Went there with the ladies for some drinks and food. The wait was 20 min for a table which was reasonable and we decided to start with drinks. We got a carafe of red wine sangria and it was awesome. Got complimentary chips and salsa! They have a happy hour menu but we got there after so we didn't get to enjoy it. Next time tho. Food wise we all got tacos. I had the fish, carne asada and short rib. Short rib was definitely my favorite although the carne asada was also pretty good.  The place is big, they even have a room downstairs for events.  Our waiter was funny and always made sure we had enough drinks water or chips/salsa. All around fun night out!"}
{"text":"For me, there are 2 things that keep me coming back to a restaurant.  The food of course and the service.  The food at Blanco fits my palate to a tee!  I have never been disappointed with any selection, but love the taco trio with short rib and the BBQ pork.  The Blood Orange Margarita is my favorite drink.  The service at Blanco is the best I have ever experienced at ANY restaurant.  From the Host/Hostess to the servers, these people are top notch.  Fox is a genius."}
{"text":"Hats off to this incredible establishment! Jamie and Stephanie went above and beyond to accommodate our daughter and her multiple food allergies! In fact- this was the first dessert she's had at a restaurant  other than Disney! And I can't forget the FOOD---OMG.... Amazing! We are foodies and this place knocks my socks off. The chopped salad w carne asada was out of this world and the tacos (fish, Baja chicken and carne asada rock). The guacamole rocks and the cheese dip----- don't leave without ordering !!!!! The street corn is the bomb! Can't sing my praises enough about this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my son's favorite places and we came here for Mother's Day. I tell you what I like Mexican food but really won't go out of my way for it. It's Mother's Day so what the heck.   When we walked in it just didn't seem like a Mexican restaurant. It's a Fox Restaurant so it had the Fox vibe. If you know what I mean. Very open and airy. Modern yet casual with an open kitchen.   Our waitress greeted us quickly and got us started with our drinks. They started us off with their chips and salsa which was very good. Chips were fresh and crispy with a very good salsa. Not too spicy but really good.   We also ordered their Nachos Con Queso Blanco. It had fresh Avocado, sour cream black beans, and tomatoes. It was really good. Everything was very fresh. Just love the chips smothered with all these yummy toppings. So good and so big.   I had their Carne Asada Burrito and got it wet with their red sauce. So good. The meat was very tender and the red sauce just made it very moist. It was a very good Burrito. I tried on of my wife's Carne Asada tacos and it was on target too. Very good. Very fresh.   Our server was very friendly and really took good care of us. I know it was Mother's Day and they were really busy but she was always checking on our water glasses and making sure our food was okay. Really good service. The food out of the kitchen came out pretty quickly too.   So overall, this was a really good meal. Good food. Fresh food. Great service. It's one of those places we're you enjoy your company and food and the ambiance isn't distracting. Just good food and service.   Would I come back? Definitely. I don't say that to that many Mexican restaurant. So enjoy. We sure did."}
{"text":"There were 13 of us, so let's start there. Large party to feed. Atmosphere  was nice and the place was buzzing.   Our server was koo and nice however very slow. He had a few tables too so that could have been why. I do have to say they didn't mess up one order which was very impressive.  We ordered a bunch of food but the food was just ok for me and the majority of our party. We all agreed that the BBQ taco was delicious. I had the carne asada and grilled fish tacos too. Both were good but lacked flavor, nothing really stood out for me on those outside of that. A few people had the crispy shrimp tacos and said they were tasty.   All said and done, would I go out of my way to eat here again? Prob not as there are better places in the valley to hit up, however I would make a repeat visit to try something different."}
{"text":"I've only been to the bar here, twice now? they dont have ginger ale... nor do they have ginger beer...this upsets me greatly."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite to eat.  Server didn't know the menu items, service was very slow. Tried to waive the server down to order a beer and she ignored me. Had to go to the bar the server walked by and tried to let her know and she ignored it. Got the beer from the bar. Food was ok. Needless to say we will not return."}
{"text":"THE FOOD HERE IS INSANE GOOD!!!! had seviche, and shrimp tacos. Everything was insane amazing. The side of corn is to die. And the mango jalape√±o marg? I'm in love. I want to go back every day"}
{"text":"Again...food is subpar but for you single gents there is an abundant amount of beautiful Scottsdale ladies. I myself am married to my beautiful bride. But go have a drink and check it out."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I just happened upon Blanco Restaurant at Biltmore mall at Camelback. Jordyn was our server she was really friendly and service was fantastic. If you go there ask for her. The food was off the hook, we had fajitas, I had steak and shrimp and my honey had chicken and shrimp. Fresh homemade chips and an array of salsas, habanero being our favorite. They gave you such a generous portion of food, couldn't eat it all. We highly recommend Blanco for a pleasurable dining experience in fact next time we come from California we will definitely come back as It is Now one of our favorite restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have been back and I would say this place deserves closer to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Chain Restaurant. Enough Said.  It's clean, friendly, disinfected, bland boring regular food you can get at 100 other places in Scottsdale,...  and the same 50 tequilas you can get at every other place in Scottsdale, blah blah blah......  TGI Fridays with tacos & valet parking ..."}
{"text":"Food was great service was awesome (Veronica) was fantastically fun, attentive, and knows the menu very well gave a some great food suggestions and they were on spot. The only thing I thought was over priced was the margarita. I will go back again but maybe will try happy hour drinks.   \"Veronica\" thank you for the outstanding service I hope to see you again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and never really had anything I've really liked all that much so that's why I'm only giving three stars, but tonight I had the tacos with a side of rice and the street corn.  That street corn is seriously one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. I really like the atmosphere and the drinks are pretty good so I've still been back a few times to try and find something I've loved on the menu and that street corn did it. I have no idea what's in it or how many calories it is but seriously I didn't really want my friends to try it that's how good it was. I'm probably going to get that and guacamole when I go back next time."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times over the past few years. I doubt if I will come back. The food was mediocre, it was noisy and the dj was annoying. It seems to have gone from a restaurant to a young bar scene"}
{"text":"Very pleasant atmosphere. Fresh & delicious food that is not heavy or loaded with cheese... Reasonable prices. Staff very friendly and welcoming.  Our waiter, Tyler, was exceptional...extremely attentive, polite, professional and friendly!"}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered here for the first time, and we ordered our meal as take out. We called ahead and the woman on the phone was extremely pleasant. She transferred us to another guy who took our order, he was also extremely polite and professional. And said that our order would take about 20 min.  In 20 min, we walked up to the bar and were greeted and helped out. I ordered the slow cooked BBQ tacos and the portobello and vegetable cheese crisp. They were both extraordinarily delicious. Even as a take out, the cheese crisp was crispy. It's like of like a pizza or flatbread, but way crispier. My meal also came with black beans and rice, as well as chips and fresh salsa. Very pleased with this place."}
{"text":"All time favorite for a number of years; not a bad item on the menu. If you don't know what to order, the short rib cheese crisps are to die for."}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot for date night fun, great food, and excellent service! The mixed berry margarita is delightful and the short rib & avocado cheese crisp is delicious!! We absolutely love every FRC restaurant we've been to and are so happy Sam Fox has chosen to build his restaurant empire here in Phoenix. As an example, we were having dinner at Blanco this past Friday and had lingered around until near closing. Two groups of 4 people walked in just a few minutes before closing and were seated with no problem. This may seem simplistic to some but I've seen customers turned away when they come in near the close of the restaurant. This just goes to show the ethics that FRC instilled in their employees to always put the customers first!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place for a drink and appetizers on the patio.   Tried the Carne Asada Burrito for dinner last week and it was bland.  For $14 I expect a burrito that is a lot better that what I can pick up at Roberto's.  I would easily rank a Roberto's or Los Flav's Carne Asada Burrito way above this pocket gouging tortilla."}
{"text":"Went here for Cinco De Mayo with my parents.  Wait wasn't too bad, about 30 minutes.  We also went to watch the Cavs playoff game.  We got a great booth, which was nice and the food was really good.  The flourless chocolate cake was AMAZING.  My only complaint is they changed the TV away from the game and when we asked to change it back they said we could go watch it on the other side of the restaurant on the other TV.  Thankfully we were done with our dinner, but that was extremely rude..."}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is subpar.  Called ahead and put my name on the list, quoted 20 minutes. 35 minutes later I asked how much longer... They said they text me a while ago to seat me. Come to find out they had the wrong number.  Finally seated at a table. Music was too loud for the environment. Received our appetizer before even getting waters for the table.  I ordered Mexican chopped salad. Had too much dressing on it. Server never checked on us or refilled our drinks. Got the bill and was ignored for the remaining time."}
{"text":"Bad experience! Food is bland - I'm not a spice freak so if I think it's bland -it's really bland.. Skinny Margarita tasted like tequila and lime water.  It really needs to have a little sweet taste to make it more drinker friendly.  The hostesses seem confused about which seats are inside and which seats are outside.  We requested outside and then asked to be seated on the side where the sun wasn't in your face and they took us to an inside table.  When I reminded her we had requested outside which is why we were waiting she seemed to have a light bulb go on and took us out to one of 3 available tables.  Inside is very noisy with concrete floors and high ceilings.  The Waiter was either poorly trained or just not capable.of making good decisions.  I watched him pass by our table 3 or 4 times when we were waiting for a first drink.  I also watched him go take orders from 2 separate tables of 5 while my husband held his credit card and bill out for the Waiter to see was ready.  The icing on the cake was actually a piece of paper towel in my husband's Spanish rice! This place is destined to fail if management doesn't get a pretty quick handle on all these issues.  I feel it's my civic duty to protect others from a similar experience"}
{"text":"Pretty good restaurant but dances with the fine line of being over priced. We started out with the mango jalape√±o margarita... A taste you need to acquire... Then tried the wild berry margarita and loved it. We then got the pork nachos... Very little meat and lots of chips... If there was more meat the dish would be great. We then split the fajitas (we got all three sources of protein) and this meal made the trip completely worth it! I want to try the enchiladas next (they looked fantastic)! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Blanco, a.k.a. exspensivo, is another of the Fox Concepts restaurants with \"traditional\" Mexican food, tacos, enchiladas, beans, rice, except with a \"high end\" and healthy ingredients. For example, the fish tacos are grilled Mahi instead of deep fried or the usual white fish. The staff wears funny striped shirts. The decor is modern and pretty cool, their colors and branding remind me of Tammie Coe Cakes. They have a good selection of tequila. And the food is just ok. If you want great Mexican food, I suggest finding the closest hole in the wall. You will feed two for the price of one at Blanco. Not that Blanco was no bueno, but for the price, it should be great. It is worth a try, though, so go and see for your self."}
{"text":"Love. Casual great food.  Not a date spot - more of a casual dining vibe.  But really good mexican food.  I am a little salty that they don't serve Churro's everyday! LOVE the bright decor.  Feels like we are in Malibu!"}
{"text":"When Blanco's first restaurant opened in Scottsdale, I thought it was overpriced and lacked a truly Mexican vibe. I gave it plenty more chances, and I do enjoy their tacos, and being able to order a bunch of different ones to sample. My more recent experiences at the Biltmore location though have left me totally unimpressed. The food is good, but the happy hour margaritas are not strong at all and in my opinion are overpriced. When I stopped a server to ask her about the WiFi, she said she didn't know anything about it and told me to ask the bartender... \"they know that stuff\", was what she said. If she was busy and needed to get to her tables, I would have appreciated if she had been honest. I truly don't believe she didn't know.... but if she didn't she could have asked someone to find out or said she was busy but would find out and get back to me. The bartenders were way more slammed at that time than the restaurant and after my one weak margarita I just decided I would leave and go to taco guild where the food is much better and the drinks during hh are less expensive and way better. I'm done with Blanco. It's not a bad restaurant, just not my vibe- too corporate, and it lacks soul."}
{"text":"Blancos has the best tacos in town!!! Almost am content with only ever getting their award winning Bar-B-Q pulled pork tacos every time I go there. Perfect date restaurant! Just make sure if it's a weekend night you call for reservations because it gets packed!"}
{"text":"Some of the best grilled fish tacos I've ever had and the prices were VERY reasonable. Paid $14 for dinner and $5.50 per beer."}
{"text":"Five stars evenly distributed:  1) Italian Blood Orange Margarita: Not too boozy, not too weak. Salt rim and lime on top.  2) Queso blanco: My favorite kind of melted cheese. I would've made this my entree with several baskets of chips. Luckily the group I dined with would've judged, so I ordered a \"real meal\".  3) Fajitas! Hot and steamy, like a meat facial, when they arrived at the table. It would've been good to split the dish... but I didn't. See point #2? I have little self control when queso is in the mix.  4) Good for groups: Having been a server in years past, large groups (8 or more people) are tough, no matter what. Rather than seat our crew of 16+ at one long table, they split us up into two groups of 8-9 each. Made for fast service and more intimate conversation. My water glass was never empty and food came out way faster than I had expected.  5) Location: Biltmore Fashion Park reminds me of the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto --¬†indoor/outdoor combo, upscale shopping, lush greenery around. Definitely feels upscale even though you are in a mall.  This would be a great spot for work dinners, lady date happy hours, or a spot to take picky parents. I'd be down for any one of these options, as long as queso is involved."}
{"text":"Chips are fantastic here with the salsa. The tacos are freaking amazing. I had a mixture of tacos and they were all fantastic. The servers say the BBQ chicken tacos are one of the most popular - believe them and me - they are fabulous. Drinks were pretty good. I had a specialty margarita when I was there, but my parents enjoyed their regular margaritas too. The beans that aren't refried but look like refried beans are delicious. Definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Blanco's for a few years now. We have never had a bad meal there and the service is always very good. If you like spicy then be sure and ask for their Habanero salsa. I like it a little better than the regular salsa. Depending on who made it, it can be a little hot! Another \"tip\" is buy the Fox Restaurant gift cards at Costco and use that to pay. Saves you 20%!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night for the first time! The food was excellent, the wait wasn't long, and the service was excellent! Definitely recommend the tacos! (Mix em up!)   *the live music was an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Ordered barbecue pork tacos. Great food and service. A bit too loud and too many flies. We sat inside so the flies were a surprise. Would go back and still recommend since the food was good."}
{"text":"Went to Blanco for lunch today with a friend and had a great time. A co-worker of mine raved about this place so I was eager to check it out. Nice spacious restaurant with a more than friendly staff who were very attentive to both me and my guest. The food was really tasty. It wasn't traditional Mexican food, but I really enjoyed it since I'm not really into sweating while I eat from hot and spicy food. Try the green chile pork enchiladas and wash it down with a Chucabras' Pale Ale. Lastly, sit on the patio before the heat hits. The place is definitely a scene as well if you're into that kind of thing."}
{"text":"For a restaurant at the mall my expectations weren't super high, but I was impressed with my meal here. I got the taco plate with a mix of carne asada and shrimp tacos with a mixed berry margarita. Everything was amazingly flavorful, from my meal to my drink. Our server was personable and very professional. Overall, I was had a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm not a typical gooey Mexican food kind of girl, but I do love tacos.    I've been to this location several times for lunch and their service and food is always consistent.  Lunch does get busy but we can always get in.  I stick with their chips, salsa and guacamole.  They have fresh chunky guac, and their chips are hot and on the thicker side but light and crispy.  The perfect texture.  I love their crispy shrimp tacos and this time I decided to do the BBQ pork tacos.  Said it was award winning and my goodness I wasn't sure but turns out they are right.  BBQ taco was on point and all of a sudden the crispy shrimp tacos weren't as good as I remembered them to be.   We were stuffed and couldn't finish our food, so we packed it all up.  Great service and food as always."}
{"text":"The to-go window is the bomb!! Super cheap restaurant quality smaller portion meals! The nachos are so good and for $4 bucks you can't beat it. It's definitely tasty and I recommend adding jalape√±os and a side of salsa.   The quesadilla was dry and not very flavorful which is one of the reasons this shy's away from a 5 star review. The other reason is the soda is ridiculously overpriced. Like in the middle of a theme park overpriced. It's obvious the make up the cost from overcharging for soda being as tho how cheap the take out window menu is. It's $3 for a small and $4 for a large (medium sized)."}
{"text":"Probably great for snow birds.  Had to wait 25 minutes to be seated.  5 hostesses is a bit much.  Cute outfits though.  Took a long time for server to come to take order.  Ok chips.  Bland and tasteless pureed salsa.  Asked for other salsas.  One was tomatillo and it was spicy but still bland somehow.  Other red one was just a bland.  Had cheese crisp.  It was alright.  Side of beans.  They were just alright.  Companion had carnitas.  VERY BLAND.  Rice was bland.  Service was slow and just alright.  Noticed a huge selection of tequila.  Didn't drink that night.  Did have fresh squeezed oj.  Pretty good.  Glad to have option of fresh squeezed.  Offer grapefruit too.  Looked like an interesting foo-foo drink menu.  Nice ambiance.  Music was annoying jazzy music that went on and on.  No variety.  Overall, the food is so boring and tasteless.  Reminds me of Maria Maria.  Not authentic Mexican food.  Made us think that this place is for snowbirds from midwest who don't know any better and aren't used to spicy or authentic.  They would probably love it.  Price is too much for the boring food.  Thought it was going to be good as you can see the chefs cooking while we waited to be seated."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here to check out blanco. We have never been here before and we are blown away on how the atmosphere is!! Very open and inviting and the margaritas are the bomb!!!! You got to have the blood orange! Our server Eli was very prompt and always very chill and easy going. I would highly recommend to come here and just enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"This was my first time here, a friend suggested it as they apparently have the best white queso.  We just ordered the queso and lemonades,  neither of us we're exactly feeling like a whole Mexican meal. The environment was casual,  I love restaurants with open kitchens so that was cool. I'd definitely try this place again and maybe actually order food."}
{"text":"We ate here on a Tuesday with 4 people and the service was pretty poor.. Our drinks took forever to arrive, and we had ordered an appetizer but it didn't come out so we asked the waiter and he had forgotten we ordered it/did not put it in the system. Ordered the Chicken Mole and there was zero Mole sauce in the actual dish that we could see, had to get a side order of sauce. 3/4 dishes came out at once but no mention of \"oh yours will be out soon!\" Finally we had to ask where the 4th dish was. Had to ask for refills on water/chips, etc. Felt like waiter wasn't paying much attention to us, although he was polite. Food was just OK, my deconstructed \"enchiladas\" were swimming in grease but they were tasty. Someone in my party ended up with corn tortilla tacos even though he had specified flour. Overall atmosphere was pretty cool. Beware the \"Mexican\" food here is not at all typical southwestern, much more of a fusion-type of deconstructed meals resembling more traditional dishes. I probably wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Lovely setting, dog friendly patio and awesome service. Drinks were okay but not great, seeing that we weren't finishing (or barely starting) what we ordered our super nice server offered to replace them for free. Great place for a casual Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Decent service, good food. However I have to admit seeing all this dust everywhere throughout the restaurant especially on my booth was pretty gross. I'm amazed how this went unnoticed. I took it upon myself to leave a little note. The server saw me and the dust and commented \"hahaha yeah there's a lot of dust here.\" Wooooooow really?"}
{"text":"The first time I have been to blanco and it was a great experience. We were celebrating my girlfriend's 21st birthday and it turned out perfect. It all started with the service I got while setting a reservation. The girl was very nice and they called to make sure I was set for the time that I reserved. Then when we got there the server was friendly and helpful while we picked through our drink choices. I definitely recommend this place for a casual sit down while on a date or for a big group like we had. The service was great but the food was even better. I got the three tacos which you are able to mix match which is very nice because there are many good choices. Everything tasted fresh and the drinks were great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and I enjoy it. It's trendy and hip and I think the food and drinks are great! The atmosphere is perfect for grabbing a bite/drink with friends. It's got an upbeat vibe and you'll see people from all age groups here. They also accommodate large groups, which is great! It's loud inside though so this isn't really the best place for large groups if you want to be able to talk. haha. Parking is usually packed so they offer complimentary VIP.  My only issue is that each time I've dined with them they are late on my reservation. Also, I went for my birthday dinner last weekend and our waitress was a bit snooty the whole time, but whatever.  Definitely give them a go! :)"}
{"text":"Food- The complimentary chips and salsa are delicious. The chips are homemade and a little bit thicker than most restaurant tortilla chips. The salsa is also really good. I typical get a mixture of side dishes and mix them together to make a \"naked\" burrito or burrito bowl. The beans are perfectly seasoned and really flavorful. Same with the rice. Their charred corn is always cooked well. I did get the carrots and jalepenos one time, and it was SO spicy that I couldn't eat it. I have a medium tolerance for spice.  I also enjoy the White Peach and Hibiscus Margarita. It has a great flavor.  My husband typically gets the Machaca Burrito made Enchilada style. It comes in a cast iron type individual casserole dish.   Service- The servers are really attentive and helpful, giving suggestions of menu items and accommodating special requests.  Decor- The design of the restaurant is really cool. Nice blues and whites, huge industrial type light fixtures. A nice patio and stocked bar in the middle of the main dining room.  In all fairness, we don't frequent Blanco, because you can get Mexican food that is just as good at a cheaper price point, but I do enjoy splurging on the ambiance of Blanco once in a while."}
{"text":"All you need to know is short rib cheese crisp!  Ahhhhhhh! So good!   There are a ton of Great taco options and tasty salsas. And don't forget to try the sangrias! I've never had anything short of wonderful service and always enjoy the peppy environment."}
{"text":"We love the outdoor area and the open concept of the restaurant. It's a great place to sit and relax after shopping. My favorite thing to eat here is the salad. It's fresh, crispy, light and flavorable. For taco, the machaca is good. Unfornately, their tacos are buried under a bed of cabbage but it's still good. It's been awhile since I been here, noticing their menu has changed. I didn't see their the chicken mole dish. It's too bad."}
{"text":"Definitely our go to Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale. Don't get the Blood Orange Margarita if you only want one, there too good!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was terrible. Waited and waited and then the wrong food was served. Cancelled a second glass of wine as we would still be there if we had waited for it."}
{"text":"Blanco sucks.  Plain and simple.  The food sucks; it's not even Mexican food.  The only thing Mexican is the fact that they use words you'd find on a menu at a Mexican restaurant.  I love other Fox restaurants so I was quite surprised.    Try again guys...better yet, don't!"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour!  I love this kind of place where they serve  the HH menu at a dinner tables and our comfy booth.   The 3 sauce dip was outrageously good-  we gobbled up that cheese sauce and guac, and the charro bean dip was delish too.  Kids quesadilla was a big portion.  Street tacos are small but full of deep flavor.  I'd come back anytime!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at Blanco tonight. Very busy but we were treated very well particularly by our waitress Charlotte. She had fantastic energy and attitude that deserves recognition. Food was excellent. Highly recommend tacos!"}
{"text":"Great shortrib nachos - loved the queso that melted over the entire stack of nachos, enough for two to share for a heavy snack.  Guac was good - but nothing special.  Clean, modern dining. Great patio space out front."}
{"text":"So I gave the Blanco in Tucson a less than favorable review, yet at the same time I couldn't wait for this one to open. Sure, I miss Taneko Tavern, and all of its sake covered glory. At the same time Fox RC always opens up clean, safe-bet, fun restaurants and Blanco is no exception.  The restaurant is brightly colored, with loud lounge like music, and an overall buzzy feeling atmosphere, even if the uniforms make me feel like I am at a frat house. I wouldn't come here looking for innovative Mexican cuisine, because Blanco serves a very American style of cuisine, but with tortillas. They have an obvious American atmosphere, that makes me immediately think of the spa crowd coming here before or after their treatments or in between shopping stops. You'll also see a lot of older folks that come from Paradise Valley around lunchtime or for mid-day drinks. Hey, if you don't have to work, then why not drink your day away on $12 margaritas, right?  The salsa is a sweet, almost candy like substance that goes very well with their grease puff tortilla chips that are glistening-golden brown. Their menu features 8-10 different tacos, all available on either soft white corn tortillas, or yellow corn fried shells. My favorites are the steak and ahi tuna, both full of flavor ($12) and plentiful for a meal that doesn't make you feel like you overate. They also have several entrees which feature steak, seafood, and chicken between $14 and $22 which I have only sampled a couple, both very satisfying.   I've never gone into Blanco craving Mexican food, expecting Mexican food, or telling my guests they are going to get Mexican food. It's always been well received by those who I have brought here, and always a fun place to be for a couple of drinks on a busy Friday night. Seriously, the name is Blanco, Spanish for white. Shouldn't that be a dead give away this is American food?"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch last Saturday with my friend/neighbor.  The food and drinks were DELICIOUS! I had the pork bbq quesadilla and a blood orange margarita.  VERY flavorful and GOOD! My friend had the tacos with beans and rice, which she said was ALSO delicious.  The BESTEST (lol) part was that I mentioned I was allergic to shellfish and the waitress stated that the chips were fried in the same grease as the shrimp. SO a VERY NICE and KIND woman came out and offered to go to their sister store next door and get me some chips from there because they do not have shellfish on the menu. WONDERFUL!  She brought them over with a fresh cup of my own salsa.  THAT is SERVICE! I SOOOO appreciated that.  WOW!  I will be back and will HIGHLY recommend Blanco to friends and colleagues.  Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been coming here for years now and the food is always on point! Fast and great quality. We've noticed management has been changing over the last couple of years and it just seems to keep getting better with time. Really like the new GM Nate! He always recognizes us when we come in and really seems to be doing great things with the staff. Really like the new flatware that they are using too!"}
{"text":"I will start with saying that we have been a big fan of blanco for years, when it used to just be in Tucson. We went for mothers  day and we were all prepared to order our favorites and they had zero short rib? Of our party of 8, 5 of us planned to order something short rib. While we ordered other items it was completely disappointing and honestly the reason we went was the short rib enchiladas!  They were *out* at 12 noon?  So, super disappointing and we won't plan to go back. No reason to not have one of their signature items, on a holiday no less. Definitely missed the ball big time today."}
{"text":"If Sam Fox -- armed with his bevy of outrageously attractive servers, compelling interior design and people-pleasing menu items -- can't make a restaurant work in this spot, then no one can. Blanco is like the 4th or 5th name applied to this strangely dead zone in a really hot location over the last few years.  As has been my experience in about half my visits to FRC (Fox Restaurant Concepts) places, there was a mild service issue. In this case a friend's order was forgotten twice. To be fair, we were seated at the bar on a busy Friday night. The manager comped his meal to make up for it. That was nice.  What wasn't as nice was needing to stare at someone's discarded bowl of guac sitting in front of me just behind the bar for the entire visit. Guess they need more help for busy times.  Otherwise can't complain about much here. It's a Sam Fox take on gringo-Mex. The carne asada tacos were as expected. I'm convinced no one in Phoenix really wants authentic anything when it comes to Mexican, so here you'll be enjoying good-Mex-as-envisioned-by-account-manager-visiting-from-Chicago. And there's really nothing wrong with that.  It's not cheap, but the ingredients are good and nicely arranged."}
{"text":"Love several of the tacos! Nacho appetizer is the best. Creative mixed drinks and the service is always excellent. I enjoy the open concept and the fun, beachy atmosphere. A good place to take out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"A Modern Mexican restaurant with an upscale atmosphere - I like it...   Three of us had the privilege of dining here last Saturday. The drinks, the service, and the unusual food were all outstanding. The prices are very fair as well...  Great location with several other \"walking-distance\" choices if they are too busy (J Alexander's, Fogo De Chow, El Torito, Flemmings, Quilted Bear). Close to Old Town for nightlife too...  Good luck Blanco!"}
{"text":"First time here was last night as I was here performing for a group of execs downstairs. The place seemed to have a nice vibe - it definitely looked like a Fox style restaurant in terms of the way the kitchen looked and the Urban feel.   I ordered the Chicken Mole and Holy Mole was it yummy! To be honest I was NOT expecting it to be nearly as off the hook delicious as it turned out. Frankly I expected something quite ordinary which is standard fare for most small chains.   But no, this Mole was deep and complex - and certainly reminded me of some of the best Mole restaurants I've been to.   Making a good Mole is a huge pain - a laundry list of ingredients and slow cooking times. The chicken itself was butter tender, with mostly dark meat and no bones to speak of... just heaven on a fork with flavors of exotic spices, cinnamon, chocolate and many more all mingling together to create a 5 star Mole experience (my opinion). Yes there was a little heat, but just enough kick to know it was there and not a drop more... perfect!  The side dish was a kind of brown rice, and a vegie mix - excellent as well.  The serving staff was outstanding as well - especially JORDAN and Emma. Very positive, attentive, friendly and accommodating.   I will 100% be coming back here - Blanco Tacos exceeds expectations and I can't wait to try some of their other dishes. This place is great."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed myself here! Wait staff was on point. They were friendly and accessible without being over-bearing. They even gave us fresh tortilla chips and salsa to take home. A side serving of guacamole is HUGE. I dined on the shrimp tacos and they were divine."}
{"text":"Everything was okay.  And only okay.  Except the Iced Tea, that was really good.  It wasn't that busy.  Seemed well staffed.  Food was okay, More expensive than expected once it was delivered.  Mole is more like a stew, beef tacos a lot like beach tacos. Not dressed particularly well.  Nothing delivered to the table without asking.  Sometimes twice.     Service was very *meh*.  Server did't actively refill glasses, didn't get new silverware immediately when someone dropped theirs...didn't deliver dinners together, didn't do anything that wasn't asked.  I won't avoid it.  I won't seek it out or suggest it, either.  Just okay.  All of the dishes were just okay."}
{"text":"We have visited Blanco many times and have had good service. Last night we visited with some family members that were from out of town and didn't have a reservation. It was their last night in Phoenix and they really wanted to eat there. We were a party of six so a table was not available for two hours. My husband spoke with the GM Harry who was able to find a spot for us on the patio with only a 45 minute wait. He came by to check on us after we were seated as well. Our server Andrea was fantastic. She was patient with us as we asked questions about the menu and everything in our order was accurate and timely. Thank you for another great meal. The ambiance and food were outstanding as usual!"}
{"text":"Another Fox Restaurant success! Both times I've been to Blanco it was with my good group of friends for two separate + special occasions, and we've had great times there so far!   Can I just say to begin with.... those chips and salsa are ADDICTING. Like cannot stuff my face enough of them even with ordering a full meal...even with having eaten a small protein-full snack beforehand. What do they put in them?!? Besides the chips and salsa (and queso!), you gotta go with the tacos or the Mexican Salad. Tacos come either with flour or corn tortillas [go with corn!] and cannot recommend enough the street corn side instead of the standard rice or beans. You will have #NoRegerts spending the $1 or so extra for street corn! Crispy shrimp tacos = a little too spicy but really good.  Carnitas = mouth-watering Mahi = fresh fresh fish  The menu is fairly simple and straightforward with hefty tequila/southwestern flavor drinks on one side and taco/street foods on the other. The margs IMO tend to taste a little too sour for myself, but the flavors are totally there. My faves are the Italian blood orange & the hibiscus flower. If you want no-frills, go for the skinny marg. The bartenders are happy to make any small changes to the drinks if you ask. All of us"}
{"text":"Came in twice on a recent visit to Phoenix and both times were awesome! On the first visit, we ordered the Nachos Queso Blanco which were deliciously creamy and cheesy, and the Famous Guacamole, and they aren't lyin - it's famous for a reason! I was not a fan of the celery in the Ceviche we ordered but that is just personal preference. On the second visit, we ordered the Queso Fundido and the cheese was yummy and stringy and the toppings really made each bite pop! There is a reason we visited here twice and I hope to visit for a third time again soon!"}
{"text":"Best tacos we've had so far in our 8 months living in Phoenix. We both had the carne asada, BBQ pork, and crispy shrimp tacos.  Excellent!  The beans were good and the rice was very moist and tasty too! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really enjoy Blancos.  However, we only go on Saturday or Sunday for lunch (to avoid the Scottsdale club scene at this restaurant at night).  The food is decent Mexican food. I am always satisfied and I also always have leftovers.  The best part would have to be the drinks - I love their margaritas - very fresh.  The only negative would have to be the service. Every time we sit at the bar, we receive impeccable service. However, if we sit elsewhere in the restaurant, it's pretty poor.  Overall - a great lunch place with wonderful margaritas"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for a while now sincw we were in Scottsdale doing some thrift store shopping and we decided to check it out.   I was impressed with the clean and modern decor. I loved the open kitchen. I can be very OCD when it comes to my food so being able to see what is happening really gives me peace of mind   Anyways, we were seated immediately by the manager. He was very nice he asked if we ever been there before and he was gracious enough to go over the  flavor profiles of each dish.   what caught my eye on the menu was the grilled fish tacos! The presentation was so cute.. Was so excited to eat.. but as soon as I bit into it I thought that was a mistake.. there was no flavor, food was very Bland. The only highlight of this experience was my Margarita. so delicious, a little pricey for the size, but the flavors were better than the food. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Blancos earns five stars from me for 2 consecutive dining experiences: the first, lunch on my own and second, a taco + fiesta party pack order (don't skip the fiesta party pack!) for 15 I placed while I was there, and picked up and served to guests the next day. First, my lunch of Mexican salad and shrimp was fresh, crispy, and nicely balanced; the server was on point throughout and saw to it that the manager would come discuss my party order. Second, the real five-star earner of this review is the party pack take-out: the tasty meal (roasted chicken & braised beef rib tacos) was reasonably priced, expertly packed, obviously cooked fresh for the order, and generously portioned. My guests were nothing but complementary! Unquestioningly, my impression of Blancos has moved up a notch since my last review. This place, folks, is where you should place your next party order (do I need to remind you that Super Bowl is around the corner?)."}
{"text":"We went on a particularly gorgeous evening at sat on the patio- I highly recommend that! The music inside is a bit loud for my taste but it was better outside. Anyway the food and service were excellent. My husband loved the house specialty enchiladas and I really enjoyed the salmon. We ended up with more food than we could eat and it was all delicious. We had a great time."}
{"text":"Really not all that impressive. I had the ahi tacos and the ahi was super salty, to the point where I was actually trying to scrape the salt rub off with the side of my fork. The taquitos and chips and salsa were ok, but everything was sooo salty! I love salt, but I felt blah all night after eating my meal, wishing we had gone somewhere else. The best part of this place is the swanky vibe, you feel like you're eating at a nice resort in Mexico."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on 6/3 as a party of 2.  My experience was so bad they comped my meal without me complaining whatsoever (slow service, wrong food, excessive time).  Fox Restaurants tend to not be very good (in my experience) and should be avoided if another option is available."}
{"text":"I love the energy and atmosphere at Blanco. Sat on the patio on a beautiful evening.  The chips and salsa were delicious, the meals were another matter.   The carne asada burrito was dry and flavorless.  The chopped salad was a mushy mash of wet wilted lettuce.   Yuck.  The server was very friendly and attentive so it wasn't all bad. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'd give the food 3.5 stars - the shrimp ceviche was palatable, but perhaps a little watered down.  The grilled fish tacos were good.  Food came too quick for my liking - Its a restaurant, not a cafeteria.  Appetizer came out minutes after we ordered and the tacos came before we were halfway finished with the ceviche.  I finished my food before I finished my first beer!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour drink menu is large. Prices aren't that cheap, but definitely a value compared to the regular prices. The food happy hour menu has lots of options as well and depending on what you order will depend on if it's a good value. The tacos are 3.50 for a street taco, which is an awfully high happy hour price for a street taco. With that said it was a good taco. I've had both the beef and chicken. The dips appetizer is good, I love the queso and guacamole dips, but could do without the beans. It has a smokey flavor which I'm not a fan of, but know a lot of people who are. The quesadilla is good not great but definitely a value on happy hour. I added beef this visit which gave it some more flavor. Service is always great here. Wish I loved the food more."}
{"text":"We had thought about stopping here for lunch for more than a year, and finally did. I totally agree with Pat W.'s review...THIS IS NOT AN EXAMPLE OF A FOX CONCEPT RESTAURANT. The hostess was frumpy, the interior was noisy, lacked any charm at all, and still had much of the left over design from the Japanese restaurant that used to be there and went out of business. As for the food, the chips were run of the mill, the salsa was AWFUL (what canned prepared salsa are they buying? Certainly nothing fresh like the many great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale!) The Mahi tacos were TINY, over salted, and dry. The Carne Asada and Short Rib tacos were also very tiny, greasy meat, and not much on flavor.  Bear in mind the 3 tiny tacos are $18. I would never recommend this restaurant to a local resident or a tourist ."}
{"text":"Pork burrito was tasty and filling, but the pieces of pork in the burrito were too large so I found myself having to cut the meat to eat it. It would have been a more pleasant experience if the pork had been shredded. They do have a nice outdoor patio for people watching."}
{"text":"I was looking for something new to try and actually my boyfriend pick Blanco's where as I wanted seafood.  Well regardless, I'm so glad we went. The quacamole dip was amazing! Probably some of the best I have ever had.  After we demolished the dip and salsa we got out entrees. He ordered beef enchiladas and I got the shrimp and steak fajitas.  I wish that I didn't love he dip so much so that I could have enjoyed more of my awesome food!  It's a definite must try. Atmoshpere was great; food delish, and don't miss out on their margaritas!  I'll just take one of everything."}
{"text":"On a whim (and because we were hungry), we decided to try this place, especially as it was recommended by a relative. We went for lunch and sat outside. So nice not to have to brave the snow that others around the country are having to deal with. The waitress was very helpful and she gave us some great food suggestions.  Two of us had three tacos each and the third member of the group had a burrito. We were all very pleased with our choices and we all cleaned our plates. I had a Negra Modelo on tap which was perfect.  Our waitress could have been Penelope Cruz's double (well, maybe when PC was a few years younger). She added a little extra zing to the meal! Definitely a fun place for lunch in the sun."}
{"text":"Came in a couple days ago with about 20 girls celebrating a bachelorette party and our waitress was amazing! The manager came up to is a couple time to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Food was amazing and I highly recommend the prickly pear maragarita!"}
{"text":"First impressions are everything. Hostess was totally ungracious to put it lightly. Straight out rude. Based on the introduction won't be back."}
{"text":"My son and I went to Blanco this evening.  It was amazing.  The restaurant itself was clean and open & airy.  Our server was wonderful.  She was attentive without being intrusive.  She also went above and beyond.  When it came time to box up my leftovers, she gave me extra salsa without me asking.  In a time where customer service is seriously lacking, it's the little touches that stand out.  Now for the food: the chips and salsa were very good and the burrito was absolutely delicious.  Not to mention the rice was the best I have had a Mexican restaurant.  I am not from the Scottsdale area but would definitely come back when I am in town to visit my son."}
{"text":"A very hip establishment that was hoppin' on this Friday evening during Restaurant Week. Located at Biltmore Fashion Park. Waited about 45 minutes to be sat inside at a booth near the noisy kitchen, The decor was trendy like the new taco joints have become. Overall the food was prepared well that's described in my several pictures. Was Impressed with the chicken fajitas, ceviche, chips, & guacamole. Chicken mole was good. Only memorable criticism is store bought salsa that was surprising to us with a prominent Mexican restaurant..."}
{"text":"The best!!  I had the Pork Enchilada. Amazing. The flavors are so good. Beans with bacon and the rice were so flavorful. Highly recommended!!  Tacos were awesome"}
{"text":"Stopped in here while waiting for our table at a nearby restaurant for a margarita with friends.  The place was packed so we hovered at the bar where we got served pretty quickly some awesome margaritas, chips, and salsa.  Looking forward to my next trip out here to try some of their food."}
{"text":"Once again had a 5 star experience. Wait staff is incredibly friendly patient and kind. This time tried the white peach margarita... Holy cow so good. New favorite Mexican restaurant in town. Alex and Sergio are amazing. Love you blanco!!"}
{"text":"Blanco Taco and Tequila was ok. We went for drinks and to share an appetizer. We wanted to sit on the patio where the fire pit was, but it was full at the time. So we settled for a table on the other patio for our first round and a cheese crisp.  We shared the short rib and avocado cheese crisp and it was good. The ingredients tasted fresh but it wasn't too spicy. I expect a little spicy when tacos and tequila are incorporated into the business name. Regardless, it was satisfying.  After we finished our little appetizer, we headed to the patio with fire where we originally wanted to sit. There was then room, so we sat to have a few more cocktails and finish the ones we had. Well, we were able to finish the ones we had. Nobody acknowledged us for the ten minutes we sat there. The patio is open seating so it wasn't like we skipped a step and didn' t have the host seat us. We were totally ignored. I was definitely disappointed. This took away any desire I had to come back.  If I'm invited I will go back. It's not on my list of places I will choose to go to though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. Everything I've had was very good. Plus they serve Pepsi. I typically get the Fish Tacos, but had a burrito tonight. We shared some guacamole and nachos. Great appetizers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a late lunch today and loved everything about this place! I really liked the atmosphere here. Our server, Steve, was amazing and incredibly helpful in making suggestions. Service was extremely prompt. All of the food and drinks tasted great. I definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"We were staying at the Biltmore and decided to walk around the Biltmore Fashion Square.  Decided to have lunch at Blanco Tacos & Tequila.   Food:  DELICIOUS!   Everything had amazing flavors.  You can tell they spend a lot time putting TLC I to all these dishes! I had the Chicken and Poblano Pizza. My husband had the street tacos.  All the flavors were awesome!!  SERVICE:  Excellent!! From hostess, server to manager.  Our server was great!  Very friendly and informative. The manager, Cricket, was absolutely exceptional!  She is super genuinely nice!! We even chatted for awhile.    PRICE:  Reasonable   AMBIANCE:  Very fun, Latina music, clean, friendly, casual.  I would highly recommend you to try it! I am a foodie and a cook so trust me when I say the food is great and service was exceptionally great!!  Will definitely return!! :)"}
{"text":"Ok- I think it's fair to say working for a Mexican restaurant company for a few years gives me a serious opinion on Mexican food. Blancos Tacos and Tequila gives a absolute great impression of serious fresh food. Server Teresa was so attentive and friendly. Management also attentive  Stellar operation."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco spots in the Biltmore area! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent! I ordered the virgin Red Berry Margarita which was fruits and refreshing. Their taco menu is totally customizable, so you can mix and match any three options. I got the Carne Asada, Chipotle Shrimp, and Grilled Mahi. All three were excellent! Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. Great atmosphere as well. Would definitely come back here!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the Blanco GM who read my review and responded within 2 hours of my post.  He was very interested in hearing about our experience, improving their service and trying to make it up to us.  Now that's customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Came on Cinco de Mayo and it was packed. Service was awesome. Since it was so crowded it was really hard to hear in the restaurant.   Absolutely love their chips perfectly salted. The salsa was also good not very spicy and the guacamole was awesome and plentiful.   When you order the tacos they let you choose any three from the menu. I had the BBQ and carne asada. The BBQ are one of their award winning tacos and I can see why. The blend of flavors was amazing. Overall everyone in my group loved their tacos. The only one someone didn't like was the shrimp.   One of the girls wanted to go back a second day for the burrito."}
{"text":"Way too much for a little street taco. Server was pushy and seemed to want to get us out of there as fast as possible. 1/2 off happy hour is the only reason for the 3 stars. Poor service, mediocre food. Probably won't return with the service we had."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites! Super cool environment and staff. If you go, GET THE STREET CORN! It is super delicious, I wish it was a main dish lol. I always get a burrito when I go, and have never had a bad one! They also have super good margaritas, I'd recommend the blood orange. Super love it, of course I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Cool place.  We sat at the bar and were served very quickly.  Chips/Salsa - Very good.  The chips were light and salted.  The salsa wasn't too hot.   BBQ Pork Tacos - They were very good.  Very spicy.  I don't know what it was, but man they were hot.  The rice was a little mushy, but hopefully it was just this batch of rice. Crispy Shrimp Tacos - Very good.  Spicy too.  I would come back and try some other stuff."}
{"text":"The only saving grace this place has is the customer service. Our waitress was sweet and tried her best to accommodate our taste buds but the food was just not willing to comply.  Jack N nailed it right on the head. He literally said everything that I had planned to write down for my review.  Like I always say you can always tell the quality of a Mexican food restaurant by the salsa, beans, and rice. What's the first thing they bring out? The traditional salsa and chips. The chips not bad. The salsa TERRIBLE! I should've known with the name Blanco that it was going to be super mild and bland. Seriously the worst salsa I've ever tasted. We tried to add pepper to give it a kick, but no. I even asked for a spicier option and the only other option was their roasted mango salsa, which was about as spicy as the other with our addition of pepper. Ok so it had a kick but not enough to kick it over the satisfactory scale for us. I've had better salsa's from a jar at frys.   We did actually have food and drinks. We ordered the nachos and a couple tacos. The beer was good, the Machaca and Chicken tacos were surprisingly good. The nachos, just like the salsa, lacked flavor spice and ingredients.   Given that it's Snottsdale I'm really not all surprised that they're still in business given their competitive Happy Hour prices in this area, even tho they fear the jalape√±o.  So if you're a person who wants to play the Scottsdale uppity role, that can't handle the spice, just looking for some place to drink beer and snack on some decent street sized tacos this place is for you."}
{"text":"Love love their fish fajitas, freshly made chips & salsa.  The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is due to the noise level & height of the tables - if you're short like me you might feel like you need a booster seat."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars.  Recipes consistent across locations. Clean throughout.   I usually go to the location near the Borgatta but was near Biltmore this time. Friday night, prime time, no wait!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for getting another one spot on! We'll be back.  Seating was quick enough. Front end staff very courteous.   Wait staff appeared quickly to take drink orders. Chips and so-so salsa came next.   Red chili chicken enchilada and machaca style braised short rib burrito. Both perfectly prepared. Nice plating. Good seasoning. Generous portions. Mexican chocolate cake for dessert - a bit small to share - was dense and really flavorful.  The place was jumping but the staff were all moving really quickly - and, it looked like they were enjoying their work."}
{"text":"What is so great about this place?  I have a couple of friends that talked me into going, not sure why!  I had the steak tacos and my friends had the fajitas.  The service was great and the guy that helped us was very friendly which made up for the crumby food.  I think we would have been better off going to the Salty Senorita..  If your looking for a good place for a Margarita and aren't hungry go to this place."}
{"text":"Tacos and cervesa! Get the slow sweet pork tacos, you will not be disappointed. Also, get the queso as an appetizer. So good. Muchas bueno. Enjoy! Oh, and you can mix and match on the tacos if you want to try different ones."}
{"text":"great food (have the cranberry Margarita and carne asada tacos), great service and wonderful all around experience. we had a long wait due to a surprise rain shower which moved those dining outside in and they did all they could to get us to a table plus the host brought us delicious guacamole for our troubles and the manager stopped by to personally apologize and thanks us. our server was perfect and the decor was darling. we will definitely be back - even with the 40 minute drive to get there. one of my favorite mexican places ever."}
{"text":"Really enjoy dining at Blanco.  Have not had a bad dining experience here.  Have been to multiple locations and they always have consistent food.  Love the Mexican Caesar Salad!  It is probably my favorite menu item.  Also, they have great guacamole, chips & margaritas.  Have tried to chicken fajitas before and those are excellent, as well.  Cannot go wrong here.  Staff is very helpful at giving recommendations.  Very annoying when you ask \"what is good on the menu\" and they respond \"everything\".  Staff does not do that here; they give excellent recommendations and know the menu very well.  One of my favorite Fox restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been to Blanco twice and I haven't been thrilled with the food either time.  Their chips and salsa are just okay.  I feel like their salsa lacks flavor.  I usually order the carne asada tacos which are nothing to write home about.  Their house rice is very creamy and not like most Mexican rice dishes I've tasted."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere. Delicious fish tacos. Friendly staff. And, oh yes, a blood orange margarita."}
{"text":"I went to Blanco today for like the millionth time!! It's honestly my favorite but I had to write a review because it was so great today :)   I went with a few friends-not normal for us on a Tuesday-but it was poppin at Blanco as usual! I love this place! We all got margaritas and tacos and our bellies are full and happy!   I had the Classic Margarita and three different tacos! I had the pulled pork, carne asada, and the grilled fish! All amazing but the pulled pork was definitely my favorite! I would highly recommend the queso with chips for an appetizer or the guacamole!   Thank you Blanco!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food, outstanding service! Very pleased with this restaurant. Our appetizer took a little long to come out but our food and drink came out right away. Recommend the blood orange margarita thanks to our awesome server! Will definitely be returning here again!  Steak fajitas were on point and cooked oh so perfectly. Beef \"house specialty\" enchiladas....omg....LIFE CHANGING!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a night in search for desert. When Blanco's first opened up they had the most amazing, flavorful, savory tres Leches cake. I would even hop on by and order it for take out because it was so delish. Since I sold my date on this cake we walked on over and were disappointed to hear they no longer carried it on the menu. WHAAAAT!  We settled for the sopapillas but to be honest they lacked the pizzaz. Won't go back to Blanco's for desert.. But will just for a margarita!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a good margarita and the Machaca tacos were fantastic. My brother ate the ahi tacos which I tried that he raved about which I thought were just good nit great. Salsa was too mild for my liking so they brought out something with more bite which was good.  You can quickly come addicted to chips and salsa.  Nice atmosphere and nice urban feel to it. The dining room was spacious and very open.  I especially like the bar.  Ole'"}
{"text":"I love Blanco Tacos! The atmosphere is so fun and inviting while the menu is full of unique, flavorful and creative options. This location is located in the Biltmore Shopping area and has nice outdoor and indoor options for dining. I love the inside because it makes me feel that, although we're in a desert, the beach must be nearby! It's obviously not, but hanging in with tacos, drinks and day-drinking music makes me feel like I've escaped the desert temporarily.   I've been here twice and the service has been fantastic both times. Quick, efficient and very accommodating. I just visited this location today with a group of four and we were seated right away. I usually struggle when debating between tacos, but Blanco let's you mix and match. Not only was I able to order three different tacos but my colleague ordered an enchilada that mixed two of the options available. Instead of ordering the rojo chicken or verde pork, she asked for the verde pork and it was no problem! Seems like a simple request, but I know we appreciated it!  I ordered the taco plate, which included: mahi taco, carnitas and the award winning slow bbq pork. Each had unique flavor and I was surprisingly full afterwards. We also shared queso dip at the table which was very addicting. Overall, I am a fan and am currently craving it as we speak!"}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, Y'all. I know good Mexican food. I can cook it, have access to it on every street corner, and I can definitely take the heat. By far THE BEST cheese enchiladas I have ever had. Asked for spicy Salsa and they brought it. Portions are HUGE. Price is minimal. I will be back in Phoenix for work in a week and cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican places I've been.  It's not very traditional but very tasty. They layer the enchiladas like a lasagna.  The enchiladas were the best I have ever had. The service was fast and very attentive.  I definitely will be coming here again."}
{"text":"I went here last minute and its a nice place. I wish they made table side guac. I like how there isn't such a long line for food and the service was quick."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place has so many stars. I wish I would of just ate at amc espenade now. First, it took so long to have our waiter greet us and get our drink orders. This was my first time here, my friends had been at the original Blanco several times.  They were craving the nachos.  Now typically when a menu item has been changed either your server will tell you or the menu will state the change.  Neither happened in this situation.  My friends didn't like the taste of the nachos and they specifically asked for no cream on them.  It came with cream on the bottom and both girls are lactose intolerant.  This ruined the dinner. The nachos were sent back and my friends had upset stomachs the rest of the night.  My meal was the short rib tacos.  These were actually good but this is AZ and good tacos are expected anywhere.  They claimed I was getting borracho beans. These beans were just refried and not smashed all the way.  I will not be reccomending this place and to have a restaurant in such a nice location you have to really step up your game Blanco"}
{"text":"This is by far our favourite restaurant in the valley; we eat here every chance we get. We've had everything from incredibly large group dinners to just he-and-I dinners here; each experience has been great. I dinged Blanco a star, however, because the hostesses are... Well, they are incredibly rude and not too bright. Yawn. Anyway, the service (besides the hostesses - hostessi?) is great, the food is amazing. Definitely check this out."}
{"text":"We just had yet another great dinner here at blanco. We came in late, about an hour before closing. The hostess that seated us seemed to be working double duty and turned out to also be our waitress. Hat tip to her, our service was great, attentive, consistent, and on point. Chips and salsa here is always exceptional, the rice tastes and smells great. We'll continue to enjoy food at this location!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness all around! We just flew in from the East Coast for a few days to get away and wanted something fresh and happened to end up here. Boy are we glad we did! Our stomachs were 3-hours ahead so we ended up at Blanca's for dinner at 4pm-ish! It was still a super positive vibe, fresh food, fish tacos were wonderful (and I'm a seafood snob!) and didn't taste \"fishy\". Service was on-point and loved the atmosphere.  Will be coming back to the area with our 4 teenage children and will definitely be bringing them! Now bring your restaurant to Raleigh-Durham area in NC!"}
{"text":"this is a very great place, come during happy hour for delicious drinks, if you don't, you could still get really good food, no matter what time of day it is"}
{"text":"Great food as always! I had the chicken and carnitas tacos with black beans and the pomegranate and grapefruit margarita. They also have a great HH menu.   My gf had her 3 year old daughter with us and they made sure to bring us crayons and paper to color on.   Great service!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with food, drinks and service!  Cute employees are always a +++  We have good margaritas, beer, free chips and salsa, carne tacos, and chicken and shrimp fajitas!"}
{"text":"The BEST rice I've ever eaten. Ever. If I was on the show the best thing I ever ate, that might just be the dish I'd highlight. It tastes like its made with sweet cream butter. It's interesting and addicting. Great specialty drinks. The layered enchiladas were very good."}
{"text":"Cute Mexican restaurant with high ceilings and sleek decor. Service is wonderful, everyone is smiling and happy to help. We had FRESH squeezed fruit margaritas with Don Julio (my fav) . Pomegranate and grapefruit was my favorite combo. They even have weekly specialty cocktails.You can order three different types of tacos instead of just 3 of the same kind, which is great because I wanted to try more than one kind (I had chipotle grilled shrimp, carne asada and grilled fish).  My favorite was the carne asada, but the grilled shrimp was a close second.  Comes with black or pinto beans and a lovely, buttery white rice with corn (this was a truly unique rice and I would definitely come back just to try it again). Happy hour from 4pm includes half off drinks. Don Julio drinks for $5? Anytime!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner, very nice seating arrangement & good customer service. This is one of the places that reels you in with complimentary chips and salsa which are really hard stop eating. I had mixture of tacos and they all are fantastic. They have happy hour 3-6 on weekdays. Definitely recommend going here"}
{"text":"I went here with the BF tonight for restaurant week and honestly.... it was not that awesome. The space is very nice looking and open, which was probably the best part of the night. We shared some guac... and it was fine... not overly flavorful, but not bad or inedible... I had the short rib enchiladas and they were also ok. The short rib was good, but the sauce did not add anything to it. The beans were bland and the rice was waaay too buttery. The BF had the chicken tacos, which he liked, but I thought it was at about the same level as chilis.... nothing special. We had the tres leches cake and it was really dry for supposedly being a tres leches cake.... It kinda tasted like a dry carrot cake with milk around it. Not awesome. I would not come back here, but the food isn't really worth the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"Where to begin... this is a Sam Fox restaurant so automatically you know it's going to delicious!! I always start off w their famous guacamole w their roasted poblano, chiles, caramelized onion and cotija cheese. And automatically you are given fresh chips w salsa as you sit down. I usually get the sparkling sangria which is sparkling wine, brandy, peach and lemon. It's so refreshing and good. If you're not into sangrias then go for their margaritas. The pomegranate/grapefruit or tropical pineapple margaritas are my favorite!! I always try to eat something new whenever I come since they have such a wide selection. If you live enchiladas then definitely try the beef house specialty which has braised short rib in it. It's seriously so hearty and absolutely delicious. Also I get an additional side of their rice. My husband and I are both obsessed w their rice. If you more of a taco person then go for the braised short rib, crispy shrimp and carne asada tacos. And this last time I tried their Mexican chopped salad which has roasted corn, guacamole, black beans, crispy tortilla and I added grilled shrimp. It comes w a creamy chipotle ranch sauce. It did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Service: 1 or 2 stars Food: 4 stars  The service here cracked me up.  It was so laughable it was almost entertaining.  Our server reminded me a lot of Kaley Cuoco but that's beside the point.  First, she was extremely nice and friendly - no issues there at all.  She's probably a great friend :)  But, here are my issues:  1. When she first came over to us, she warned us that she just had three tables sit down and it would be \"crazy\".  She was definitely right. 2. We had to ask for water multiple times and didn't receive any until about 20 min after sitting.  It took another 20 min after asking for a refill. 3. She brought over the wrong drink order 4. The wrong appetizer arrived at our table before the two correct appetizers arrived 5. Once we ate all our chips, it took over a HALF HOUR to receive a refill.  We asked two separate servers and a bus boy - it still took 30 min to get chips! 6. We ordered our appetizer after about 30 min (definitely a long time) and it took another 20-25 min before our waitress came back to take our dinner order 7. There was a fruit fly walking around on my taco plate 8.  The waitress was flirting with and touching my friend's husband  The food was so good, but I won't ever go back because of the \"crazy\" service."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the Valley by far! The rice would have to be my favorite item on the menu. It is different from the regular red rice, but is a white cilantro flavor. The servers are always very nice and attentive. I have yet to have a bad experience at Blanco. I look forward to my next trip down there!   Favorite Dish: Baja Chicken Tacos with extra rice :)"}
{"text":"I love this place. Service is always great and the food is amazing. The music is a little loud but other than that is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great margaritas, awesome tacos and amazing service!  I always make it a point to come out and also when flying out of terminal 4 to stop off and have a breakfast burrito.  Yum craving the place again!"}
{"text":"My last experience at this place was very nice.  I was impressed with food quality and the great service.  I ordered a variety of things and everything was very good, including the chips and the salsas.  As with most Fox restaurants, there is a lot of focus on making the plates look very pleasing and the flavors and textures did not disappoint.  The entire group I was with walked away very happy with every part of their meal.  The atmosphere is very clean, spacious and inviting."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. The restaurant was not even half full on a Sunday afternoon. It took over an hour to get our food, Thirty minutes to get our drinks. Food was decent but not worth the wait. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Blanco, you are amazing! First, this is Fox Restaurant, so how could it be wrong? I have a friend who is away for school and often says she misses Sam Fox more than her parents; I can understand why. :)   My parents and I were very excited to return to one of favorite restaurants. We started our meal with complimentary chips and salsa. We ordered their famous guacamole to share and it was wonderful.   Next, we ordered our entrees. My mom got the Mexican salad, I got a vegetable fajita platter, and my dad got chicken tacos. Everything was delicious and the kitchen was very accommodating with our modifications. It is a super vegan friendly, but the way.  We can't wait for our next meal at Blanco!"}
{"text":"Blanco Tacos + Tequila never disappoints. The staff is always so friendly and their tortas are heaven!!! Ask to be served by Samantha. She went above and beyond to make sure our orders were perfect because I am very specific. It's nice to see that Harry is still the GM. He does a great job running the place. Great boss = great employees"}
{"text":"A-OK is the best way to describe Blanco.   First, the chips and salsa were great. Much much better than most Mexican places I have been to. The server was very nice and she stayed on top of our drinks and chip refills.  I ordered the Chicken Burrito with black beans on the side. The chicken was shredded and tender. The marinade was also good but a lot of it came with the chicken in the burrito and it got pretty messy, not surprising for shredded chicken though. The rice was VERY good.. pretty sure it was soaked in butter, still delicious.   Overall this place was fine. I would maybe go back again and try tacos but nothing blew me away."}
{"text":"Good was excellent but service was very slow. We were seated immediately but server seemed to not be on top of things. Other servers brought and refilled drinks, and our server didn't even get the order correct. A little disappointed cause I was kinda in a hurry."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  Fusion.  Quesadilla, enchiladas, margaritas, service all excellent.  Thanks you for doing a great job."}
{"text":"Visited last night spur of the moment decision was able to get a sitter and was craving Mexican but wanted to try something new, so we pounded our heads together and decided to visit Blanco.  This was our first visit and for a Wednesday this place was full,we were greeted by a friendly Manager who wass helping at the desk for a bit to manage the wait, we were quoted 30-40 minutes and decided we would head to the bar to get a drink while we wait. The two girls behind the bar were very busy and could of used a third, they were having a tough time keeping up but were still friendly, however with one girl in the well getting buried that left only the one to handle the crowd and guests at the bar, with that said they were able to get my order we had a beer and a margarita and both were great... beer was cold and margarita was very good!   We checked out the place very modern with good Latin/Hispanic music in the back ground with a cool open kitchen.After about 30 minutes our pager went off and we were escorted to our table. We were greeted promptly by our server Justin ( I believe that was his name) he was professional and curtious and had all the answers to our questions.  We had to try a cheese crisp, because that how we always do it, not my favorite but not bad...We couldn't make up our mind so we decided to do the fajita combo. Different compared to most on the presentation but the chicken and steak were both great. The chicken and steak must be prepared on a grill because they have a smokey flavor to them, possible mesquite.   Over all glad we stopped in and will make it back soon....."}
{"text":"Great food, love the happy hour prices for drinks.  Loud place but very nice.  We sat inside because it looked like rain.  I would like to try the outdoor seating.  I thought even with the happy hour prices, the drinks were smaller than at some places."}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite restaurants. The food is delicious, the service is usually pretty quick, and the outdoor seating is comfortable. Highly recommend the short rib burrito, and the salsa that comes with the chips is awesome!"}
{"text":"Mehhh I am sorry to report that the service here was not good today. Blanco normally has decent service with great food and drink but today was no bueno. We had a party of 8, they sat us at separated tables (tables could not be moved in the bar area) and then the service was so slow that it took us 2 hours to have lunch. We didn't order anything crazy, queso and margs to start and then 1 entree each. My coworker ordered the mushroom tacos, and there were only 5 or 6 mini chunks of mushroom in each. The mushroom was really more of a garnish and not the taco filling itself. Another coworker didn't get her food, they had to go find it. Checks took forever. We discreetly asked for a surprise birthday dessert for the birthday girl and the waiter took the menu over to her to pick her own dessert, which made it no surprise at all ugh! I don't know, hopefully they were just having an off day."}
{"text":"Awesome as always! I brought my parents and sister here, who are visiting from out of town, and they liked it a lot. We got the $3 dip special for happy hour and they got the margarita specials. At the recommendation if our server i had the mole chicken with vegetable arroz. A little spicy and very delicious."}
{"text":"Where to start...This place is a \"Scottsdale Spot\".    A contemporary way to mix good tacos, sangria, and  good times.  The atmosphere is really fun and I would suggest for all occasions.  We started off with a carafe of Sangria, kept it coming with some appitizers and finished it off with some tasty tacos.  THUMBS UP. Let the good times roll...."}
{"text":"Have been to Blanco several times over the past several years. Stopped going about 2 years ago because I felt it had kind of lost its pizazz.   Revisited last week for dinner, and was pleasantly impressed. They seemed to have kicked it up a notch. Braised short rib cheese crisp with avocado was good and their enchiladas...even better! They are served in a mini cast iron skillet and come out super hot and fresh. Chips and salsa were awesome too!  Blanco is back in my good graces!"}
{"text":"I went to Blanco on a Thursday night for Happy Hour. We arrived right around 4:30 and were seated immediately. Our table was right between the dining room and the patio, so we were able to take advantage of the beautiful breeze without having to sit outside. What a cute restaurant- very open and chic.  We both started with the Pomegranate/Grapefruit Margarita- a great option if you like a little bit of sweetness in your marg. It was served on the rocks, so it went down pretty quickly. Following the Pom/Grape Margarita, I decided to give their Classic Margarita a shot. It tasted like it was made with real lime juice instead of boat loads of sweet and sour mix, so that was a major plus!  The chips and salsa were great. Nice, thick chips and a hearty salsa with just a touch of spice. We decided to try the Queso Fundido, as we are both huge fans of most queso dips. The server warned us that this was very different from the normal queso, but we ordered it anyways. It arrived in a small pan and was thick! It had been baked which transformed it from a diappable treat to a \"fork some onto my chip\" experience. It was also served with fresh flour tortillas which were much appreciated. The biggest downfall of this dish was the chorizo. The chorizo was slightly burnt and was dripping grease everywhere. Gross.   The drinks were great, the chips and salsa were delicious, and the menu is still full of other items I'd love to try.  Our bill for the four margaritas and the queso came out to $22- fantastic happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"We LOVE FOX restaurants in general, but it's nice that they have this Mexican restaurant thrown into the mix of their usual Italian, Steakhouses, etc.  The food here is SO GOOD!  Service is usually really good too.  Sometimes, we'll get an average server which is why didn't give the FULL 5 stars, but this is definitely a must visit!!!  The atmosphere is great with a nice patio.  It's not too awful casual in that it feels like you're dining at a pretty nice restaurant yet you could still get away with walking in in your nicer work-out attire (which I have)."}
{"text":"I came for the Blood Orange Margarita (excellent), and just to be sure it was legit, I had two...was tempted to have a third, and thought the wiser since it was Tuesday and a early morning mtg was lurking.  So, to keep the buzz going, and achieving my goal for the evening, I only ate half of my enchilada, which on a normal day would have been finished. It was the green chilli number, with pablano peppers, or something like that; anyway, it was layered like a lasagna, and came in it's own cute little skillet! Good flavor, and the tortillas cooked just right, not soggy or too well done.  Pro tip: only eat half, and consume all the sourcream (it doesn't heat up well) and bring the rest home for lunch and add your own fresh stuff.  Tried eating all the black beans, which were good, however, one can only do so many while catching a buzz on Tequila, and fresh juice and eyeing lovely ladies (oh snap, I knew something was missing). Perhaps I shall return on a Friday night.  I sat at the inside bar, which was a bit too compact (this made for superior efficiency, however), or maybe the TV too big, because I was having to look up at an angle that was non-conducive to my personal preference. The outdoor seating along the bar looked to be at a better distance from the TV, but I decided not to look the part of a social outcast and stayed inside...I know, I should have stayed home if I was going to drink and watch baseball, right?  Cool place to chill during the week, and a bit more happenin' on a Friday night (see comment above), especially now that the evenings are cooling off...Yay!"}
{"text":"Wow! This restaurant is fantastic. We had fajitas, tacos, guacamole and margaritas - all excellent. The portions were just right. We highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went here on NYE and loved it! We had a late reservation so we came early to have a drink at the bar. Awesome margaritas. We were seated pretty close to our reservation time which was good considering how busy it was. It took a little while to get our food but out server kept checking in with us to let us know that the kitchen was very busy. The food was excellent and very affordable too. And great service from the bartender (who was also our server) and hostesses."}
{"text":"Sweet ambiance, friendly staff. Exceptional service, great tasting burritos and tacos. Austin did such a great job. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here the other day. This time ordered a skinny margarita, guacamole appetizer, and Baja chicken tacos. Everythin was amazing, service was excellent and the atmosphere was beautiful. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Oh! My... I love this place!!!!  The food and service is excellent! Great atmosphere, really if you are in the area, it is worth to try, you will love it! I will definately go back next time I am in Scottsdale!  Be prepared to wait as it gets very busy, but is all worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch.  My co-workers got the Mexican chopped salad which they really enjoyed.  it looked pretty healthy.  We shared the guacamole for an appetizer.  It wasn't my favorite guacamole, needed a punch of something more sour or salty or something!  I preferred the free salsa and chips they give you.  For my entree I got 3 tacos: short ribs, pork, and fish.  They were all really tasty!  Came with a side of rice and beans that was just pretty regular.  The atmosphere inside is nice, I enjoy dining in there.  I think in the fall and winter it'll be nice to hang out on their patio.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Hostesses weren't very welcoming ... Isn't that their job? ;)  Server was great and had a good knowledge of dishes. Tacos were great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OMG this place was amazing. We came here to celebrate my sisters birthday. Our server was amazing about checking on all the questions we had about dishes and she was on top of all of our drinks.   Some of us started with the spicy margarita and it had the perfect amount of spice and was well balanced. The blood orange margarita was amazing too, full of delicious blood orange color and flavor. The table started with the queso and guac, the chips that came with these were crispy warm and perfectly salted which was a great accompaniment to the dips.   We all hemmed and hawed over what to get because it all looked so good and to be honest we all ended up sharing any way. I am a huge carnitas fan and loved it in the taco. I also tried the enchiladas and they were all amazing, the sauces had great depths of flavor.   The manager was amazing and brought out a dessert sampler she put together herself and a candle for my sisters birthday. The staff was amazing, the drinks were delicious, the food was scrumptious, and the atmosphere was fun!"}
{"text":"Several locals recommended this place to us and we are so glad we came.  The BBQ pork tacos are probably the best we've ever had.  And the corn is also amazing.  Everything we had was good.  Highly, highly recommend.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yet another successful Sam Fox concept. Good food, nice atmosphere fast friendly service"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The service  is great the food is amazing, all of the tacos are great, but you must try the pork belly one and fried chicken with chimichurri sauce, to die for!!! Will be back soon!!@ plus great tequilas and beers"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the Biltmore. The environment is awesome & service is amazing! Matt the manager is very professional and takes care of his customers. Nikki & Christian behind the bar are always welcoming & make the best margaritas. Happy hour here on Friday's are the best because they have live music. Amber was my last server, she was very professional & gave amazing service. Never had a bad experience here & I would recommend this place for a family dinner or just a drink with a friend. Perfect atmosphere!"}
{"text":"A friend and I visited on Tuesday (cause taco Tuesday, you gotta have tacos) and left feeling completely underwhelmed and agreed walking out the door, \"yeah, never going back to that place.\"   Our server was a woman who could not be bothered. Water was empty the entire meal. When we asked \"which tacos are your favorite?\" she answered, \"I don't know they're all good.\"   We ordered tacos and a classic margarita on the rocks with salt, and it arrived with no salt. No big deal, but she never came back to check on us after dropping the drink (like, literally set the drink on the table and kept walking). A food runner brought over our tacos, and our never did a quality check.   The carne asada tacos were oddly sweet and the smallest things I've ever seen. They were fine tacos, not my favorite... but for a $50 bill for TACOS and a margarita... whaaaaat.   The server came back to the table after we were mostly finished with our meal and dropped off the check. Did not ask how the food was. We fully intended to order a side of guacamole and another margarita and hang out for a bit, but at that point felt like it was done.  On the way out of the restaurant, the girl at the host stand looked directly at us and turned her back to to continue wiping down menus. It was not busy. The least she could have said was \"thanks guys,\" or \"have a good one.\"   10/10 would never return to this restaurant. Go up the street into Old Town and get some tacos from the hole in the wall place on Saddlebag. Some of them barely speak English yet service is 90 times better than what we received from this girl."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious from the chips and salsa to the carne asada burrito.  The restaurant looks like a fancy restaurant, but it has decent prices.  The waiters and waitresses were friendly and attentive. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Doug was our server and was fantastic!  Other than that...drinks were ok, tacos were small, yet tasty. We tried the short ribs, the bbq pork, steak, carnitas and shrimp tacos. The rice was awesome while the beans were mediocre....black and pinto. Happy hour was kinda lame. I wouldn't choose this place but wouldn't be opposed to going back."}
{"text":"Love the tacos- the bbq pork and green chili pork tacos rock!! My favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"3-stars for the food, 4-stars for the service.   We hit this place last Wed because we had a gift certificate and walked into an hour wait. Seeing as that we had a sitter and don't have that many date nights, I wasn't willing to waste an hour of it, sitting with spring-breakers in the lobby. After explaining that we were leaving, due to our limited sitter-time, the manager sat us. Immediately. Nice move, sir.  We had great service from that point on. Almost to the point where it was too much, but I won't complain about the attention.   The food is just okay and it always has been. Obviously, if you want real mexican, there are loads of better places to get it. The tacos were decent, but not original and the fundito dip is also very typical. It's like the chefs cater to visitors who don't know any better, when it comes to authentic mexican food. And that's fine, but it's not good.  The drinks are okay. Apparently everyone has to have a blood-orange marg on their menu, right now. However, the one at The Mission-- WAY better, FYI.  My biggest complaint about this place is the fact that it's just typical. And in a city the size of ours, we locals don't have to settle for typical. Unless you have a gift certificate."}
{"text":"Great vibe!!! Loved the food... drinks were amazing, service was fantastic.. definitely a place worth checking out"}
{"text":"All the food is so good! Margaritas are really tasty too and our waitress was kind and information. Its kind of pricey though. So definitely a splurge place."}
{"text":"So, for all the foods it appears they use white cheeses.  I saw photos of the cheese crisps and they looked delicious. But, I wanted yellow (cheddar) cheese. So I inquired if it could be made with cheddar/yellow cheese.  If they could not, I said I would be fine with the white cheese.    So the crisp comes out, avocado and cheese, and it has yellow cheddar cheese!  Later, the manager came by and said they had to specially get the cheese.  I told her thank you very much, because I love the traditional yellow cheese cheese crisps, and this one was fantastic.  My friend who gets filled up quickly even had a few slices of it and liked it.  It was so crisp that after I ate my meal, the crisp was still crisp. Perfectly made.  For my meal I got a burrito, but with mahi mahi in it (which was not on the menu).  It did cost a bit more, $14 + $3.  I don't think I will get it again, as it was not filled as I had expected, but was probably a fair amount of fish for the price, or close thereof.  I think I'll get the tacos mahi mahi next time, or maybe try enchiladas. They look good.  Server was very nice and efficient.  Thanks for the cheese!!! :D"}
{"text":"No spice/heat to the salsa, including the \"hot\" one that the server said was an Habanero salsa.  This was an enormous disappointment because though I can understand making the standard salsa incredibly mild because of the general public, if they're going to make a designated hot one then it ought to have a decent level of heat.  Both were rather bland.  Also was disappointed that the flour tortillas are made with lard.    On the whole, I tend to like Mexican-themed restaurants like this one because they can be more modern and creative with Mexican style food, but usually that also goes along with more vegetarian options and decent spice levels for those who like the heat.  I'm already accustomed to having to deal with pork in the beans or chicken stock in the rice, but the lard in tortillas just isn't as common in the more modern focused Mexican places.  I felt like it was a bad mixture of authentic Mexican items with more modern traits.  Margaritas were pricey but in line with higher rent areas in Scottsdale.  Tequila list was surprisingly small for a place with this sort of name.  Service was very polite and prompt."}
{"text":"Joe was a great waiter. We had a large group and it couldn't have been better service! Amazing food and drinks."}
{"text":"Not only was our meal superb but the service and atmosphere completed the perfect night out! My husband had the flavor exploding, slightly spicy, delicious chicken mole. I had the loaded with pork poblano enchiladas.  We sat on the front patio listening to the DJ mix up some great beats. Our server was attentive yet not overbearing. We frequent this establishment occasionally and last night I was trying to find some place new to go but thankfully I decided to stick with our usual and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"I came to Blanco last week for restaurant week. With a name like Blanco, I was expecting a white type of theme.  Here is my breakdown:  Atmosphere: Blanco was definitely a very modern themed \"New\" Mexican feel.  There was a good crowd there for happy hour and quite a few dinner guests coming in.    Drinks: We had margaritas and white sangrias.  I would recommend the pomegranate margarita.  You get some antioxidants, lol.  Food: Even before we get to the meal, the chips and salsa was amazing.  The chips were like Pita Style Chips and the salsa had a good kick, but not too spicy either.  We got the 2 for $30 restaurant week and 1 a la carte pork tacos.  We shared an appetizer of shrimp ceviche.  I usually like the halibut ceviche or white fish ceviche, but I was quite surprised how yummy this was with the tangy flavors I love in ceviche.  The 2 entrees were green chile pork enchilada and mahi mahi fish tacos.  I am usually not a big fan of pork, but it was flavored beautifully with the green chile.  The fish tacos were very light and flavorful.  The dessert was tres leche milk cake.  I was actually not expecting much out of the dessert since I was so happy and full from everything else.  THE DESSERT SEALED THE DEAL TO 5-STARS!  It had a creamy but light spongy feeling going down my tummy.  Service: The service also brought this rating up more.  We got great attention throughout our meal.  In the end, one of the guys who brings chips and salsa was taking my food away.  I mentioned I wanted a box.  I thought he was taking my food away to box.  A few minutes passed by, and I got the feeling her threw my food away.  I told the server what happened, and it looks like the chips guy didn't know English that well.  She brought out a brand new meal boxed up!!!  Overall, this was a great experience with great company!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Walked by it many times first time here. Food is good. The waiter was very busy and tired to rush us eating dinner. Asked if he could give us the check before we were done eating. He came back and tried to remove plates of food that we had not finished. Other than the waiter, nice place"}
{"text":"45 min wait for pork tacos ... Went there With my friend for a quick bite... Even though the place was not busy at all, service was Very slow and the food took a Very long time. Flavor was nothing special. For sure we won't go back."}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware. Watch our for the flour tacos cooked in lard, chips in the same kettle used to fry shrimp and rice in chicken broth. This was not a good culinary experience."}
{"text":"Blancos is a winner!  Tacos & Tequila - does it get any better?  Very nice decor, patio and indoor seating, super nice hostesses, bar service while you wait for your table, this is one great place.  Things I thought were great: the energy, the people watching, chips & salsa, $4 draft beers, and my Machaca burrito ($16, albeit pricey) -- but overall a great place!!  I would go back anytime!  2/16/2012: Update...the machaca burrito has been lowered to $13.  Thank you!  Had it again, sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh...so here's my beef with Blanco. For starters, the name made me believe they were doing something different and cool...maybe serving a shot of tequila with each taco order?? but no...nothing. Second, the tacos...ehhh nothing to scream about. Maybe I'm biased having grown up in LA and eating at one of the most amazing Mexican restaurants in SF, but these just lacked some punch and flavor. Ease up on the cabbage too pls! I want to taste more than greens in my taco!  I went back for a second time so I can try a different combination of tacos. I've eaten the carne asada, chicken, fish, and ahi...only the ahi was decent. I do have to say the cheese crisps they have as appetizers are great. A crispy quesadilla always wins me over. Pretty decent guac, not the best I've ever had, but good. Rice has maybe a gallon of butter in it...yum! Ha!  Being a FOX restaurant, the design of the place was great. Loved the set up with the step down bar in the middle and tables around it. Open kitchen is cool. Good music. Bit of a wait sometimes, but good for people watching and once you sit down the service is just fine.  All in all, I probably won't be back for a dinner, but maybe an ice cold Pacifico or margarita on the rocks with a crisp appetizer at the bar."}
{"text":"Never have I ever done a Facebook rant on a restaurant but when you get seated with three kids and watch groups with no kids come in after you get their chips and salsa, water, and orders taken its beyond frustrating.  We never did get served and walked out.  I don't think our table was ever assigned to anyone.  #rantover"}
{"text":"Dropped by for Happy Hour....really good!  Grapefruit margaritas were awesome!  The guacamole and street corn were also great.  Will be back for happy hour soon."}
{"text":"Loved it...this place is great!!  The margaritas are some of the best in the Phoenix area.  All of the food our group ordered was outstanding.  The waitress was very helpful and extremely sensitive to those in the group with food allergy issues.  Will definitely be frequenting this establishment."}
{"text":"I love Blancos! My husband and I dined here during a visit before moving to Arizona and the fact that we were able to eat outside on the patio in December was such a wow factor to us, coming from Michigan. This location off of Scottsdale Road has two garage doors that stay open most of the year which allows for a nice breeze and open aired dining.   Food - delicious! Tex-Mex flavors are on point and flavorful.   Ambience - love! Bar is in the center of the restaurant and they have two separate patios with outdoor seating. Fun, upbeat environment.    Service - excellent!  Never had a bad server, they've always gone above and beyond.    What I didn't realize is this is another Fox Concept Restaurant -- and once again they've done an outstanding job. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Food was great, nice atmosphere, lots of space so you don't feel cramped.  Service was quick.  We went for lunch during the week and it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Let's talk about Happy Hour!! Blanco Tacos + Tequila has an amazing happy hour. There is lots of food to choose from and drinks, of course. We had the dip sampler for only 3 bucks and it was a decent amount of each of the dips (guac, bean dip, and queso). My husband and I each had three of the street tacos - you can mix and match - and they were delicious. I believe they were around ten dollars for the three of them. Our drinks were delicious, too! I had the sangria and the margarita. Overall, great restaurant, awesome food/drinks, and wonderful service! We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Yum! Stopped by for dinner during a trip to Scottsdale. I ordered nachos, and a chicken tortilla soup for my toddler. Best chicken tortilla soup I've tried! So flavorful! Cool atmosphere. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on Mother's Day with my daughter.  The service was wonderful.  The waitress was very friendly and we didn't have to wait very long to put our order in or for our food which is always a good thing when dining with a 7 year old.  The food was delicious and they were able to accommodate our dietary needs (gluten free)."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere. Great service. Awesome margaritas. They can be a bit pricy but have great prices during happy hour."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with some Tex-Mex at Blanco! I absolutely love the patio seating, fun decor and friendly service at this establishment.   Guac & queso are a must (although they come at a price!) and the tacos were sooooo good. The taco plate comes with three, street-style tacos and you can mix and match between different menu items which is great for individuals with commitment issues (like me hehe). DREW our server was amazing and really made our visit pleasant. My girl friends raved about the enchiladas and the short-rib nachos so those are definitely worth trying as well!"}
{"text":"Blanco has the BEST service in town! We came here for our friends 21st. Austin, Tyler, And manager Harry were so accommodating and fun! They made the first stop of the night a blast. Everyone should come here. 10/10 Would Recommend."}
{"text":"Good margarita, rice, salsa and chicken tacos."}
{"text":"Best service ever. Great atmosphere. Ordered beef enchiladas, beef tacos , and cheese crisp. Excellent. Love that bean dip !!"}
{"text":"FUN!!! Love it the best part is that the employees are friendly and look like they enjoy their job, co workers  and customers I will definitely go again. In fact I made several stops on my birthday  and was this was by far was my favorite of 5 places in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch. The basic Margarita is tasty with hand squeezed lime juice. The crab and shrimp ceviche is divine and a huge portion had we known it was that big we would not have ordered the quesadillas we got. I got the chicken and poblano and my husband got the short rib both were delicious but they were very large. You can easily split this entree. Our server Charlotte was super friendly and gave us great recommendations sat out on the patio and loved it"}
