{"text":"Such an amazing authentic Mexican restaurant! Serving tacos, menudo, and primarily goat served with homemade corn tortillas. Fast service, clean environment, with great, fresh food! We will definitely be returning and passing along the word of Hola Cabrito!"}
{"text":"This place is a traditional real Mexican establishment. They only have one item in the menu, birria, but it is probably the best in town. Yes, they don't give you chips and beans but seriously, you can get those anywhere else, if you are here you should only eat the birria. They sell it by the pound but you can also get half a pound. They give fresh made tortillas so you can make your own tacos with as much or little meat as you desire. They also bring you cilantro, onion and salsa to top your tacos.   One pound is enough for two people (given that when I'm here I can eat up to 8 tacos!!) but it could easy feed three or four. Don't forget to ask for a \"consome\" (the broth where the goat is cook) with garbanzo beans and a cup of Mexican coffee!! (It's delicious and it has cinnamon in it). Otherwise you can get Mexican soda, lemonade, horchata or Jamaica (hibiscus water).   The price is good for the portion size you get. The service is attentive. The place is cozy."}
{"text":"Delicious ... and I know others agree since it is always packed but the food is worth it every time."}
{"text":"Mejor birria en Phoenix!! Service isn't the best, but when your food is so good. You honestly dont want anyone to bother. At least, I dont. Just make sure you ask for everything with order."}
{"text":"The best Birria in Phoenix. Service needs a little more work but overall, this is my favorite Birria place!!!"}
{"text":"This place is not topnoch, but the food is Amazing. They have the best birria in town.  Clean place and good service. Be ready to order. You order your birria by pound or half pound."}
{"text":"Best birria you will ever taste! the meat is super soft! Just pure goodness! have been here well over 20xs and never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"So far this is one of the places in Phoenix that has Great Birria. once you go inside you can smell The goodness.The service is quick and very polite. Handmade tortillas."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best birria i found when I came to Phoenix from LA , if you're in the area it's a MUST and if you're not in the area it's well worth the drive."}
{"text":"As you approach the front door of the establishment, you are welcomed by the aroma of birria de chivo being cooked. We were promptly seated and a very simple menu was laid on the table featuring tacos de pastor, asada, buche, and, of course, birria. They also offer menudo, birria by the pound, consome de birria, and birria soup. We had the birria soup which came with sides of cilantro and onions, salsa, and handmade corn tortillas. It tasted even better than it smelled. Be careful, though, as multiple signs inside the restaurant warn the customer, birria may have small bones, however, there were only a few in my bowl. The horchata was really good and was not overly sugary like most other places. I have yet to eat birria in Phoenix as great tasting and served in such a good portion as in Hola Cabrito. Well worth the price and very affordable."}
{"text":"Es el mejor lugar d birria de chivo aki en phx, todos los trabajadores son muy amigables y siempre dan muy buen servicio. This place is a must try! Don't be fooled by the looks it's bomb! I've been here many times and will continue to come!"}
{"text":"I really like this place but they can be rude sometimes. I asked to buy extra tortillas and they said they don't sell extra ?. The food is really good but their service sucks."}
{"text":"Was a very satisfied first time, I was there in the rush hour (sat between 10 and 12) and the service was a little slow but the food make forget it.  Very best Barbacoa In Phoenix so far.  Try the Consome with hangover."}
{"text":"Hola Cabrito!  is a goat meat restaurant!    It's been here quite a while,  and recently got a fresh yellow paint job on the exterior.    You can get goat stew, or goat tacos.   That's it!      Seriously,  that's it.     And they have soft drinks and lemonade.    There aren't any chips or beans or rice or any of that.    There's nothing for vegetarians.    I had the goat tacos,  they're simple corn tortillas with some goat and a couple dishes of cilantro, onion,  limes and salsa.     Generous portions,  2 tacos filled me up.      It's been a long time since I had goat and..  well, it still tastes goaty.    My dining partner LOVED his so if goat's your thing,  GOAT IT UP CABRITO!!      I'm probably not the best person to review this because meat's not huge in my diet.      The proprietors here were very friendly,   they do speak English and if you like goat tacos there's probably nowhere better.    The kitchen is wide open as you walk in the front door and looked clean and orderly, no fear of a crusty kitchen.    Small cozy dining area,   I enjoyed hanging out there and every table was full with happy eaters,  clearly they have a loyal customer base.     The salsa was flavorful and fantastic!"}
{"text":"Family had wanted to try this spot for some time and the day finally arrived. I must admit I was not super stoked about the idea of goat but do not believe it played into my review. Upon arrival the place had a good crowd of customers, as it always appears to have when I drive by.  The staff was friendly but a little slow. As for the meal, it missed the mark for me. I tried nearly every goat taco they had on the menu and thought the Al Pastor was by far the best.  The others (buche, asada, and cabeza) were okay but nothing amazing in book. My biggest issue with lunch was the lack of any side items. This gringo likes rice, beans, etc and they sell goat and only goat. I tried to get past the lack of sides by adding extra tortillas but just bummed that the main dish is all I would be enjoying.  Overall, not planning on going back but if goat is your thing, you may want to hit this place up."}
{"text":"The barbacoa de chivo and consom√© here are food for the soul.. after my mother's this is the place to go. Usually extremely busy since they are only open until 2pm. Service is good. They are usually very fast. You can eat there or take it to go and they even do big orders.  The only reason I am rating it 4star is because their last two heath department visits on the wall rated them a B. I work for the food industry so it bothers me a lot."}
{"text":"This is the best birria I've ever had! Great spot! Would recommend to anyone in the Phoenix area. I drive own from Glendale to eat here at least 2 a month! Waitresses and waiters are awesome and they bring your food out quickly! Amazing food!!!!"}
{"text":"Trued this place out a little while ago and I actually really enjoyed it. I recommend to anyone looking for some good Birria de chivo!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best places for goat. Fresh and not pricey at all, friendly crew. Be careful when eating, as little pieces of bone could remain in the meat. They're not responsible for chipped teeth.  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is the place: It's an old building with a less than perfect setup, the bathroom leaves much to be desired. In other words, the place is an eye sore, although not dirty. But I'm rating everything."}
{"text":"Good food, service is okay they forget easy and have to keep reminding for everything."}
{"text":"We come here everyone once in a while for the barbacoa and conzome. Price is more the reasonable and quality is good for the most part. Every once in a while it doesn't taste as good as others, as If they had a different person cooking that batch but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Fast service, great food & Service. Always outstanding. Prices are also more than reasonable."}
{"text":"We tried almost everything on the menu. It was exceptional. Everything was just done right.  I would certainly recommend the consome!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  First time here and they took the time to explain to me.  I got 4 goat/birria tacos which were to die for.  Also got some broth/consome. Also really good.  I will be bringing the family back for tacos and for menudo for me"}
{"text":"Outstanding large tasty goat portions w outstanding service..Only negative is they close at 2 so your on their schedule"}
{"text":"This place is addicting, really is the best goat Birria I have ever had- that is big since I travel quite a bit in business in Mexico, the service is good, the portions can be a little bigger but not bad for a good quality Birria- the only negative is the place is a bit worn out, the bathrooms can use some TLC- but I'll be back."}
{"text":"Would totally recommend this place. Birria is as good as it gets. Will definitely come again"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for years since i moved here, after marriage and a kid i still love coming here in the morning on the weekends for birria and caldo to have some quality family time, my husbands been coming here since he was little and im so happy to keep up the tradition. the utensils and plates are all mismatched and when you come in and start you feel like your at your tias house getting ready for the flama food to come ease your hunger, the food is simple and perfectly done with no other fancy additions this is a must for a traditional simple mexican meal."}
