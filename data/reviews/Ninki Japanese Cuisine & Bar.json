{"text":"Great service ! Great Location ! Reasonably Priced for that location !!! Great Izakaya Tapas !! Great selection of Japanese Cocktails and Sake ! Great selection of non alcoholic drinks (I love their Mango Banana milkshake & apple mango soda) I absolutely loved all !!   Me and my girl friends go there for lunch or dinner at leaset once a week. They are not crowded as one in Scotiabank Plaza or one on Adelaide St. They are newly opened and still quiet.   Lunch menu is almost same as the one in scotiabank plaza but they added some great lunch items.   My Favorite items on the menu !! (Dinner)  - Aburi Salmon Sushi  This is my favorite Nigiri ever !! Blow torched salmon sushi ! It just melts in your mouth!   - Salmon Tataki with garlic chips  ponzu sauce and salmon and garlic chips are the best match !!   - Aburi Shime- Saba  They blowtorch mackerel on your table ! Fun to watch !   - Pork Kakuni  Slow cooked thick cubes of pork belly! Sooo good !!  - Assorted Kushiyaki  their teriyaki sauce is the best !   - Ika Sugata Grilled whole squid with ginger sauce! My favorite izakaya tapas !    My Favorite items on the menu !! (Lunch)  - Stonepot Rice  Assorted Cheese and seaweed sauce in sizzling stone bowl. This makes me wanna go back to Ninki everyday!!   - Ramen Set I loved their slow cooked pork and light soup ! comes with gyoza as well !great value!   - Spicy Beef Udon I loved their soup and slightly spiced sauce.   - Bento Box  Little bit of everything! comes with all your favorite Japanese items. Teriyaki Items, Tempura, Maki Roll, and more...   - Salmon Set  their salmon is always super fresh."}
{"text":"Yum! The buffet variety was amazing and the quality of food was excellent. Orders came quickly, were hot and delicious, and the menu selection included sushi, sashimi, soup, different apps (including many kinds of teriyaki and tempura), dessert, and rice/noddle dishes."}
{"text":"soooo meh in here. The maki came out incredibly quickly meaning that it probably was not fresh. Really chewy too.... just not a pleasant experience.   I ordered a drink soon after our first dish came out but didn't get it until the end... and it was a \"peach sour\" tasted like candy, not in a good way."}
{"text":"They have a 10% opening discount. But I am not sure if its still available. Look for the small sign in the front of the restaurant window to see if they still offer the discount.  The owner is the same one as the Ninki underground in scotia plaza. Maybe because this one is above ground, but it feels much nicer. It is also quite big inside. But disappointingly the menu looks the same as the one in scotia."}
