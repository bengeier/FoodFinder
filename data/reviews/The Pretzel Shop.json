{"text":"I've been stopping in this pretzel shop since I was a wee lad!  Back when my father would take me in the back door and get a fresh hot pretzel right out of the oven for a nickel (think it was a nickel, was about 20 years ago).  I can say that this place is still every bit as tasty 20 years later!

Best pretzels I've ever had by far.  I can almost taste years and years of pretzel crunch on the bottom of every pretzel that comes out of that oven, unbeatable.  Everyone in my family goes back here every time we visit Pittsburgh.

Prices still seem to be very good, I usually need at least a dozen to eat personally.  Sounds kind of absurd, but what's absurd is how delicious they are...I don't eat them in one sitting, I find them to be just as amazing a few days later as they are right out of the oven stored in an airtight container.  Salt will make them soggy when being stored, but I still love them!

I wish I could give more than 5 stars... I wish I could have them shipped!  Craving some now."}
{"text":"Here's the truth. There is no inside seating, and the outside seating is limited to two small tables on a noisy, high traffic street. The pretzels were all cold - even the ones we asked them to heat. Service was also \"cold\" and unhelpful, and the cashier seemed as though we were bothering her by asking questions.

I had a chicken salad sandwich on a pretzel bun ... Nothing special. My husband had a cheeseburger roll that was cold, even though he asked that it be heated.  We had to ask for dipping sauce as it was not offered to us.

This is a place to maybe pick up some pretzels to take home and heat up ... Definitely not a lunch place as some have suggested."}
{"text":"Four years after moving to NYC, this is one of two Pittsburgh spots I still yearn for daily.  (The other is Mad Mex.)  I've never tasted another soft pretzel that even comes close.  Dense, salty, doughy, just-barely-underbaked perfection."}
{"text":"Located at the \"funnel\" end of the neighborhood along the South River that locals fondly refer to as Bronado Alley, The Pretzel Shop should be the first thing that comes to mind when you are in Pittsburgh and someone asks you if there's a shop somewhere in town that sells pretzels.  Trust me, if you walk into this place and offer them money in exchange for a pretzel, they will definitely help you complete that transaction.  Like their ads say, they didn't spend all morning baking hundreds of pretzels just so they could not sell them to you.  What kind of business model would that be? Sure, it'd be kinda cool in that 'exclusive' way, but you'd get tired pretty fast of not getting that salty, salty pretzel you want so badly.  Fact is, you go here, you're gonna get a pretzel, so stop worrying about it.  Plus, all their milkshakes are three dollars, $2.50 if you're a redhead.  Don't ask them why, but they steeply discount their food for redheads.  Oh yeah, it's possible they have outdoor seating, but I've never been able to tell because I've been busy eating pretzels - which this place has a lot of!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. The only person that doesn't love pretzels is a person that hasn't been here. The buffalo chicken sandwich is messy but really good. Only downside to this place is that they only take cash but hey, it could be worse."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment for us.
We went there because of all the great reviews here. The plain pretzels were pretty good, not exceptional as they had been sitting there for a while and not warm but at least they were not greasy like some other mall pretzels can be. Unfortunately the pretzel sandwiches were disappointing. The have all the sandwiches pre- assembled  in the display case and when you order them they microwave them-- which heat them up but made everything soggy. The sausage in my breakfast sandwich was very salty. We were expecting a family version of Bruegger's Bagel or Panera, well this place is not as good. The price, however, was unbeatable in the Southside area. The two of us had a filling breakfast for under $10 though you do get what you paid for. We will not go back and will not recommend it to others."}
{"text":"The Pretzel Shop is a Pittsburgh classic.  I would give the quality of the pretzels 4 stars, but when you factor in the low cost, and quaint set-up- this place gets bumped up to 5 stars.  It's a great place to stop by for a pretzel sandwich on a Saturday, for a breakfast sandwich (any day but Sunday), or to get a ton of soft pretzels on the cheap if you have people coming over.  All in all, the Pretzel Shop is a must-go if you are in the South Side."}
{"text":"Hot, salty soft pretzels stuffed with pepperoni, meatballs or sausage for under $3? Yes, please. The staff has mad skills at keeping the line moving fast during peak hours. Bring cash and get off the phone while you're in line!"}
{"text":"My favorite place by far on Carson Street.  I really don't know where else one can find perfect (not the greasy mall kind) pretzels for 50Â¢ a piece.  You can get real full off these things with a drink for less than $5.00.  Since pretzels are one of the few things I can never get sick of, I don't know what I'd do without this place.  They also have cheap dessert type foods that are alright:  nothing gourmet, but they work.  Plus, a ton of pretzel sandwiches which I have yet to try.

The only slight problem I have with the Pretzel Shop is the hours, as they never stay open past six o clock.  Other than that, I see no reason why any pretzel lover would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Got there an hour before closing and they had NO regular pretzels. PATHETIC! How can you be a pretzel shop and not have pretzels. Drove 30 minutes to get there and no pretzels, not cool."}
{"text":"Mike W. As a life resident of Pittsburgh I grew up eating South Side pretzels outside of Mt. Oliver pool being sold out of a wicker basket.Now I can not go thru South Side without stoping.Not only did I bring my kids there I now enjoy brining my grandson.The pretzel Shop is a must visit frequently.8"}
{"text":"The Pretzel Shop on East Carson is one of my favorite spots to go in southside whenever i am in need of a quick meal! Their basic pretzels are very inexpensive, much less pricey than the typical \"Auntie Annes\" inside malls! Not to mention, they are a lot better tasting! They always have helpful employees that ring you out quickly, and deliver your food within seconds of ordering! I will always be returning to The Pretzel Shop!"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST place to eat in Pittsburgh.  I wish I could give this place 10 stars.  I love pretzels!  I love this place.  I love that they won't wait on you if you are talking on your cell phone.  I love that lunch is less than $3.
My second favorite food to pretzles is probably rice krispie treats - and they sell those too.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!! I am adding some pictures of fresh pretzels!"}
{"text":"Neat place to check out when you're in Pittsburgh.  Neat operation!  Very friendly staff allowed us in the back to see how their pretzels are made."}
{"text":"\"sandwhiches\" were quite good. I enjoyed the pretzels, but nothing really blew my mind. Had the gyro, club, and chesseburger"}
{"text":"If I had a weakness, it would be the Pretzel Shop.  I'm there all the time!  Even though the shop is tiny and you can't eat inside, there is always a line to get food.  Sandwiches are no more than $3.00 and they have great cookies, muffins and desserts.  Seriously, a couple of slices of meat and cheese between a sliced pretzel NEVER tasted so good."}
{"text":"Delicious at an amazing price! Whenever my family and I are around the area we stop in to get their pretzels. The original are my grandpa's favorite, and I love the cinnamon bites. Everything comes in a brown paper bag which adds to the charm of the place. This little shop is a staple of the 'Burgh."}
{"text":"The pretzel shop is a place anyone can love! If you're from out of town, the pretzel shop is definitely a place you want to consider stopping at. The people that own the shop/work at the counter aren't the friendliest but the pretzels are worth it and prices are cheap!"}
{"text":"What!?  How did I not write a review for this yet?  That's wild.  This is a cash only pretzel extravaganza.  Every type of warm soft pretzel you can think of from Tomato Parmesan to chicken salad.  Family owned makes Auntie Anne's look like McDonalds in comparison.  

This is a place that embodies the term \"just take my money\".  Look for groupon deals and get a whole bunch for an event or party."}
{"text":"Stopped by and grabbed a pretzel sandwich for lunch today! It was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Call ahead and order their Home Baked Cookie Trays - they are AWESOME! If I fail to bring one in to work for special events, I get a heap of questions! They never disappoint with any of their baked goods, and prices are reasonable!
Pretzels are great, I prefer the bacon/parmesan ones myself.
Great food, great prices, exceptional service from an original family run, South Side business!"}
{"text":"Cheap, great food, family owned, wonderful employees.  The service is always with a smile.  The daily specials are great and they are conveniently located with extended business hours!"}
{"text":"Great selection of pretzels. So many different kinds to choose from. The pretzels are a little harder on the outside compared to Annie Anne's but they're still really good, and offered at really good prices. The cookies are good too! They also offer a selection of pretzel sandwiches and pepperoni rolls that aren't too bad either. If you're looking for something quick, this is a great place to stop in."}
{"text":"When in town, and being shown around by a (nearly) life-long resident of the Slopes, the Pretzel Shop is part of the tour. Wow. Was I impressed with the variety and price! Holy cow, everything was tasty (we tried a few varieties because, why not?) and I'm so glad we had someone show us this place. I doubt I would have found it on my own. 

Pro-tip: Bring cash."}
{"text":"Had the sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast pretzel sandwich. It was a large portion, worth the money, and was very delicious!
Husband got the chicken club and a pepperoni roll. Club was good and pep roll was incredibly squishy (in a good way!).
Also got a chocolate muffin that I can't wait to try!
 This is now one of my favorite spots! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Only 50 cents for a warm and soft pretzel--worth every penny! The pretzel shop is such a charming little place that is perfect for grabbing a quick snack or light lunch. There are original salted pretzels (50 cents), flavored soft pretzels ($1), pretzel sandwiches ($3) and various fresh pastries. Cheap and delicious all in one package! I highly recommend giving this place a try if you're a carbs lover in the Southside area!

Also as a side note, they will heat up your pretzel if you request them to. Warm pretzels are the best!"}
{"text":"The Best Pretel I ever had was the size of a steering wheel, came with Beer Cheese, and had sections that were so thick the dough had hardly finished baking. That was best  pretzel I ever had - made of Bavarian Dreams by lederhosen-clad geniuses. Yes, that was the best pretzel I ever had...

Until I found this place. 

Knowing my deep love for the softest and sourest of soft sourdough delicacies, several friends referred me to this south-side wonder. I knew I needed to have cash, so I went ready and entered a magical world of delight. Ready-to-go sandwiches with meats and cheeses on pretzels; pretzels with and without salt; pretzels with cinnamon; options to overwhelm even the Sultan of Brunei. 

I grabbed a turkey and cheese pretzel sandwich... FOR LESS THAN $4. That is not a typo. It was delicious, it was warm, it was filling... it was the best lunch I had that week. Feeling like I was in Wonka's shop, and not wanting to waste this rare opportunity (I don't hit the South Side often) I also grabbed a plain pretzel. That thing was eaten before I was done biking back to the 10th street Bridge. 

If you want a great pretzel, this is the place."}
{"text":"I don't go here as often as I used to, which is a shame.

The Pretzel Shop is another Pittsburgh Institution. Made on the premises in large quantities, you can also buy a ton for very little. It makes places like Auntie Anne's look like amateurs. The pretzels taste great, and taste even better when you take home a full bag of 'em to eat later.

The sandwiches I've had here have been enjoyable as well. I usually get the sweet sausage pretzel sandwich or the open faced veggie pretzel. They're both tasty faves and I never had one of either that I felt was not up to scratch. The various cookies and other pastries they sell here are also quite good.

I've never seen The Pretzel Shop not busy. When I've gone in and it's been relatively empty, it only took about ten seconds before there were four or five people behind me. I've based trips to the South Side specifically to go here. It's one of a kind and deserves its reputation. Now if I can just get back to regular trips there once again."}
{"text":"These are the best pretzels in Pittsburgh.  Period.  It's tough to walk by and not pick up some pretzels to take home.

I recently used them to help cater a holiday party.  a.) It was only $20 for 50 freakin' pretzels.  b.) They had the order ready on-time.  c.) The pretzels were great as left-overs days later.  Win all around."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. They gave a donation to our fundraiser. Great owners and delicious pretzels."}
{"text":"It's delicious, fresh & quick! The workers are really nice there!!! Truly one of the best places in Southside for food! Only problem is there hours and they don't take a card"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the South Side! The pretzels are delicious and the workers are so nice. Best time to get there is super early in the morning. If you drive around to the back ally  behind the building you can catch them right after the pretzels are taken out of the oven. 
So many great memories of driving down and picking up some pretzels before an early morning road trip."}
{"text":"Really great pretzels! I got a pepperoni pizza pretzel, an Italian roll, and a normal pretzel, all under $5! Just remember to bring cash because they don't take cards! I will def be back! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and ate a pretzel sandwich.

A PRETZEL SANDWICH! 

Whoever came up with this idea is a genius. I didn't even know such a thing existed! 

Unfortunately the food did not live up to my expectations. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich which really wasn't bad, however the sandwiches are premade and I'm pretty sure the chicken was just a frozen patty.

Damn you pretzel sandwich you sounded so good!"}
{"text":"The Pretzel Shop is a tradition for myself and many of my friends. It's a taste that can't be duplicated: it's honest, satisfying and a connection to the historic South Side.

It's best to eat the pretzels warm, fresh, with mustard. There's nothing quite like it. They are soft and chewy with coarse salt and a distinct aroma. It's a taste of authentic Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place is a pittsburgh MUST. I have been coming here for a long time and it just keeps getting better and better. My favorite item of theirs is their cinnamon sugar pretzel-- it is the best around. Their pretzels are soft and it is obvious that they are fresh. Their veggie pretzel is amazing- they have a ton of pretzel sandwiches which are awesome for lunches. Their mini pretzel pieces are so good and super cheap. Their baked items are incredible too! In the fall, I bought soft pumpkin cookies with white icing and they were literally the best pumpkin cookies I've ever had. I walked in the other week and they just had taken out tomato basil pretzels from the oven- oh my goodness... The mozzarella cheese was still melty and the tomatoes were hot- incredible. They also have an adorable back door with limited hours where you can purchase anything from the store plus bags of broken pretzels for a low price. I can go on all day about this place, it's perfect. They are super affordable and always are delicious!"}
{"text":"I have only had the pretzel stick, but it was really great! Reminded me of the Philly pretzels of my youth. Pretzel was dense and chewy and they have little packets of brown mustard. Fabulous. 

The pretzel \"sandwiches\" they offer look pretty atrocious, but maybe I'm just a pretzel purist."}
{"text":"This is one of my most favorite places in Pittsburgh.   I love pretzels and these are way better than the ones from the mall that are dripping in butter.  The pretzel sandwiches are less than $3 and a great lunch - not too much food.  I also like this place because it is one of the few place you can buy rice krispie treats.  This is just a great little neighborhood shop, that makes a great pretzel for an amazing price.  When they had to raise the price to $.50 they even posted a sign apologizing and explaining the price of the ingredients had gone up.  I definitely would put this on my list of places to eat in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I came here today on a bike ride and picked up a grilled chicken pretzel sandwich with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, and ranch dressing for lunch.  The pretzel \"bread\" of the sandwich was wonderful--very chewy, savory, and delicious.  The fillings, on the other hand, did not impress me--while filling, they were bland and flavorless. The sandwich was also quite messy to eat, since some of the cheese and dressing had leaked out of it, despite its being wrapped up, and continued to leak as I was eating it.  Usually, two napkins is sufficient for me, but this is one of the few times I wish I'd picked up more of them.

In addition to my sandwich, I picked up a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie, which, though small, was tasty and full of chocolate chips.  Together, the sandwich and cookie cost a whopping $4.40 (take that, Subway!).  Service was friendly and efficient.

Based on the quality of the pretzel and the cookie, I'd come back here.  Next time, however, I think I'll try one of the regular pretzels, or perhaps a pizza one.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I got a bunch of pretzels with dip for New Years. It was crowded. The girl who waited on me although she was pleasant I felt like she was hurrying me along a bit. Like I was talking to slow for her. Remember the customer in front of you is the most important one no matter who awaits behind. The pretzels are delicious but I gave it 3 stars because who waited on me was not respecting my business. It was just in and out. And that made me feel bad."}
{"text":"Get me early cuz they go quick! If you get them while they are hot you'll be hooked for sure! Best soft pretzel anywhere!"}
{"text":"Brought a friend from out of town here to get pretzels. Where else are you going to get a good pretzel in the burg."}
{"text":"Delicious and super cheap! Pretzel sandwiches- lots of variety, flakey and savory rolls.  Awesome homemade soft pretzels at 60 cents a piece. 

Who doesn't love a soft pretzel?"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Pretzel shop for decades. DECADES! I used to go to the back \"door\" where the oven is and get the fresh out of the oven pretzels that would burn your hand even through the bag. These are amazing. They've been supplying all of Pittsburgh their soft pretzels since I can remember! A  bag of these taken to give out at work will make you a hero and not cost you an arm and a leg. 

My daughter lived on the Southside and while we were gutting her house and remodeling, I'd stop here every weekend and order our lunches. The sandwiches are KILLER. You haven't lived till you've had the hot dog wrapped in pretzel dough. And for $1.75 you can splurge for a couple and live like a king! The sausage pretzel sandwich heated while you wait so that it's super tasty is another clear winner! So too is the meatball sandwich roll - for $2.45? Are you kidding me??? A great place to get great food (more than pretzels!) at an outrageous price! You'll love it!

Oh yeah, they have pretzels too - flavored ones if you like. How about jalapeno, Cajun, garlic, or parmesan bacon? Spectacular!! But here's a tip, the BEST thing in here is NOT the pretzel. It's the baked goods. Their chocolate gobs are what your mother wishes she could make. Off the chart. Get two - and not to share! You're welcome."}
{"text":"The only bad thing about the pretzel shop is that it closes at 5pm weekdays and 4pm on Satuerday.  Everything [sandwiches,pizza,cookies,3 sizes of pretzels ] is delicious !!!"}
{"text":"This is basically as good as it gets for a pretzel shop and that's not a bad thing! This place has really taken a creative spin with soft pretzels..they offer all different kinds of flavors and sandwiches..I ordered a breakfast pretzel and it was alright..as a Philadelphia native, I think maybe I'm inclined to enjoy a pretzel by itself rather than topped with a mess of goodness. :) That's just me. Oh..this place was dirt cheap too..I gave her a $20 and got back like $16 and change for 2 pretzels and a sandwich..I was like wait..what? lol"}
{"text":"This place is so cool.   Pretzels are really good and the workers are nice. Prices are great too.  I've been coming here for years and look forward to my visit every time"}
{"text":"My Saturday errand-runs just wouldn't be complete without stopping here. The plain pretzels themselves are delicious, but when can have sandwiches it's to-die-for!

 I've had the chicken club, the veggie pizza, the chicken parm roll (!!!) & even their pasta salad & I've always been satisfied! Their pretzel sandwiches are usually $3.50 (score!!!) & they have all types of variety.. even gyro!

BUT my favorite and choice most of the time would be the breakfast ones! goodness that's perfect even at 2pm. I always make sure to bring Bobby a sandwich home for after work because he can't miss out- it's not fair! 

Update:: Bobby's officially had the Pretzel Shop experience! We don't even care that we have to sit on a random person's stoop for 2 min to scarf it down ;)

**They also have a load of different types of cookies and sweets.. & if you thought the pretzel sandwiches were easy on your wallet, wait till you see the cookie prices!! Buy a Pretzel Shop shirt to be super cool walking through the Burgh!"}
{"text":"Similar to Montreal with their bagels, this shop sells fresh, hot pretzels.. REALLY GOOD.
2 pretzels and bottle of water, only 3 bucks, awesome."}
{"text":"Best pretzels in Pittsburgh! They use an Old World recipe and bake the pretzels in a traditional open hearth brick oven. Be sure to get some pretzels after they come out of the oven and are still warm - so good!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Pittsburgh but now live in Texas. I always look forward to making my regular trip to The Pretzel Shop. Pick up 30 pretzels and I am good for two weeks. These pretzels are a Pittsburgh staple. Make sure to try the back entrance for a hot baked pretzel!!!"}
{"text":"You will never find a better pretzel anywhere. Period. I remember coming to The Pretzel Shop literally 20 years ago as a kid with my dad on really special weekend outings, and when I go back today it's just as delicious, with a nice helping of nostalgia.
The pretzels are really inexpensive, drinks are cheap too, and you can get other pretzel-foods here too like pretzel sandwiches. It's a very low key trip, you could come in sweats and fit in. This is a quick stop on your way somewhere, not someplace to come and sit for lunch.
c a s h o n l y"}
{"text":"The best pretzels in town!

When any of my coworkers has to go near the South Side they stop by and get a big bag of pretzels to share with everyone in the office.
Not only you get salted or unsalted pretzels but they also have stuffed pretzels and even pizza pretzels. A great place to stop by for a quick and economical lunch/dinner/snack.
Here you get quality and price. Don't be fooled by imitations. This place has been open for decades; there's a reason for that."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was an off day or the time of day or what the issue was, but I didn't like these pretzels. I had been wanting to come by here for years and finally made it in. The amount of salt on these things was ridiculous. I like salt on pretzels, but this one had too much. After scraping off most of the salt, I went back to the pretzel. It was rubbery, cold, and difficult to get into manageable bites. Think of those microwave pretzels you get from Sam's or Costco. Now overheat one of those pretzels and put it in the refrigerator for an hour. THAT is what my five pretzels were like. I disposed of most of what I bought as inedible.

I am going to try one more time and stop in at opening time to see if that makes a difference."}
{"text":"I felt like The Pretzel Shop and I were star-crossed lovers of some sort. Any time I was ever in the southside and found I was craving some salty-carb action it always seemed to be closed. I would shake my fist at the sky and wonder who wouldn't ever let me have delicious warm pretzely snacks.

Then on a chilly but clear Friday I was finally able to make a lunch dash! I grabbed two of the smaller bacon parm pretzels and luckily had some cash on me, as it's a cash only place. 

While on the salty side, they were DELICIOUS. They weren't warm but it was nothing a quick trip to a warm oven or the microwave wouldn't cure.

If you're in the southside around lunch time, and you want to grab a quick snack or meal make sure to stop here."}
{"text":"The Pretzel Shop is one of those unique places that every city has. A wonderfully extra thick pretzel cut in half, slathered with sauce, and topped with your favorite pizza toppings, a pretzel pizza, screw the low carb diet!  Or, take the same pretzel, cut it in half and pile on turkey and cheddar, or ham and swiss, and you have a great sandwich with the extra crunch of salt from the pretzel top. What else do you need? Grab a sack full or a dozen or so pizza pretzels take them home, pop them in the oven and you have a great meal for the big game. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just the wrong time of day, but my pretzels were stale and they lasted like they've been sitting out for a few hours. My boyfriend got the cinnamon pretzel bites and I got normal salted pretzel bites and they both tasted hard and stale. It's a cute shop and is definitely unique, maybe we just came at the wrong time."}
{"text":"Amazing! Don't waste your time with the sandwiches or pizza--all that stuff just gets in the way of the main event: the pretzel! Best pretzel in the city.  Best anything in the anywhere. Cheap, too. Only complaint: not open late enough."}
{"text":"Again - this joint is great-  I love the Cheddar and jalapeno - for only 1 dollar it is as cheap as eats get.  You can get a full lunch for $3.25-  Like the fresh pretzel with parm as well as the plain-  not a fan of the cookie and other baked good but other seem to buy them."}
{"text":"What ingredients go into pretzels anyway?  I don't know - but apparently The Pretzel Shop in the South Side has found a way to mix in magic... cuz HOT DARN these are some fantastic pretzels!

Go once and you'll be back again and again and again.  You will not be disappointed (somewhere... Lou Pappan is guaranteeing that statement)."}
{"text":"The Pretzel Shop has to be one of the most unique places in the city. Where else can you get a menu that is full of pretzels?  This is a MUST stop if you're in the South Side area!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place! However, when we got there it didn't look like anything special, so we just got 4 regular pretzels (60 cents each!!) and went home. This was quite possibly the best pretzel I have ever eaten in my life. And it was cold. I wanted to drive back and get more! I definitely recommend this place if you love a quality pretzel."}
{"text":"I know that I'm in the minority... but I really do not like The Pretzel Shop. My co-workers often pick up pretzels from here for birthdays or other office events, and everyone spends the morning raving about how delicious the pretzels are and how they cannot stop eating them. Am I missing something? I just sit quietly at my desk and raise an eyebrow at all this chatter. I've had them at least 5-8 times and cannot say that I've ever enjoyed them. The regular pretzels are either over or under salted (not sure if that is a preference the customer can select or if it's just random), and the cinnamon sugar just taste strange. They often taste very soggy, too, like they were bagged when still too warm. Occasionally, co-workers pick-up the \"cheese\" sauce. This stuff looks like a melted yellow crayon. I love all types of cheese, but this looks and tastes terrible. Yes, I'm being blasphemous towards a Pittsburgh tradition, I know, but I'm sorry, I'd much rather get a pretzel from Hofbrauhaus or even Auntie Anne's in the mall."}
{"text":"Goodness. The shame. I've lived in the South Side for almost two years and just recently made my first venture to The Pretzel Shop. I picked the best day possible - National Pretzel Day - so I got a handful of extra pretzel nugs tossed in my bag as a treat. Score!!! 

I'm a pretzel junkie, and these delightful little nibbles from the pretzel Gods totally hit the spot. They reminded me of the mall pretzels I used to get; I think the name of the place was \"Hot Pretzel\" (real original, right?) only a little softer and a bit more yeast-y. 

They have far more than pretzel nuggets (twists, sandwiches, flavored, traditional), but I got enough to carb out for the day for a whopping $2 or so. 

And with that, I've sold myself on a return visit tomorrow."}
{"text":"Auntie Anne who? The Pretzel Shop has perfected the art of the soft pretzel. Their pretzels are slightly tough on the outside....you have to really sink your teeth into them to pierce their delicious outer crust. Then once you do, you're rewarded with a soft, chewy, slightly sour bite. Texturally, it's everything a good pretzel should be. The plain pretzels in and of themselves are delicious and the flavorings are just the icing on the cake (errr...pretzel). My favorites are the cinnamon sugar and the cheddar jalapeno, but they don't make a bad flavor. The shop itself is simple (cash only) and no frills....reminiscent of the neighborhood it resides in. Do yourself a favor and go get a prezel here now. And buy me a cinnamon sugar one while you're there, k?"}
{"text":"This is South Side's gem. I have been eating pretzels from here since I was a kid. Not only do they have awesome pretzels, but they make really good sandwiches as well. Prices are decent and it always feels good supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"I love the Pretzel Shop!! The pretzels are always so good and the prices are impossible to beat! I don't care for most of the pretzel places from around town but this place is amazing! You can get your fill for under $5. Plus the pretzels are extremely fresh and fluffy. A great place for some fast food. Just be prepared because seating is minimal!"}
{"text":"Time to add on more accolades to the Pretzel Shop. Their pretzels are wonderful. For one of the cheapest, tasty lunches around, pick up a pretzel sandwich then head over to a park bench on a nice day and chow down. 

A few caveats though - 
1) They tend to run out. They will reserve pretzels for you if you call in advance, though.
2) They close way too early. They should be open till at least 7pm - preferably midnight. I can't imagine the post-bar business they could do on Carson St. As it is, you'd better not get a pretzel craving after 3pm or you'll be out of luck.
3) They don't sell chips. If you're the type of person who thinks that sandwiches and chips are made for each other, take the time to stock up on chips elsewhere. As others have said, they have lots of other baked goods including rice krispie treats and seasonal cookies. Personally, I recommend a side of pretzels."}
{"text":"After having had a terrible pretzel from the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia, we happened to park right in front of this shop when we were going to explore Carson Street. You walk in and there are just pretzels behind the counter, kind of like what we're used to seeing with bagel shops here on the West Coast. Each one was $.50. You can't beat it. We shared one since we were on an eating mission and it was a darn good pretzel. Lots of locals inside just grabbing pretzels here and there to go.

TY wanted to take some back to LA, so we asked how well they kept. We were told that you could take them back and throw them in the freezer, but since we were homeless, having checked out of the hotel already, we had to forgo any extras."}
{"text":"We came here one Saturday morning. I decided that I wanted a \"specialty\" pretzel but I immediately regretted not getting an original. 

I've been here many times before but just realized I never created a review (silly me). I love their pretzels, while they don't compare to Philadelphia pretzels, they're pretty damn good. So cheap, so authentic, so Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Although I pass this place everyday, I limit myself to only stopping once or twice a week. If there is an open parking spot in front of the shop, my car seems to always pull in on its own.

Over the years, I think I have tried every sandwich here and they all taste great. My personal favorite is the hot dog pretzel. It is a party in our mouth!

Lately, I've only been getting regular pretzels. At 50 cents a piece, how can you go wrong? If you don't like a lot of salt, make sure to tell them \"light salt\". Lunchtime lines can get a little long and remember they only take cash."}
{"text":"What a gem. What a treasure. I don't think there are truly enough adjectives to describe this place. The Pretzel Shop is just one of those places you as a Pittsburgher need to go and try out and it's definitely a place for a tourist to visit as well.

Being located in the South Side I kind of feel that it gets masked by the 100's of bars which in a way makes it all the more better. It's one of those places that gets better each time you go. It's pretty small so it's easy to miss it but once you walk through those doors it's like your hit pretzel wonderland.

My personal favorite is the ham and cheese pretzel sandwich. A pretzel sandwich with real ham, not lunch meat ham, I'm talking Easter Sunday ham. I also love that they heat it up for you. If you're a turkey fan, they have those too. In addition to that they've got your traditional pretzel as well as many other flavors. You really have you pick of many delicious pretzel treats. 

If you happen to go soon, pick me up their veggie pizza on a pretzel. I've been dying to try it. Just make sure you take cash since they don't take credit/debit cards."}
{"text":"As Pittsburgh as Pittsburgh gets.

Not as cheap as it once was but I love these pretzel sandwiches.

Everyone should stop by and get at least a pretzel. You will love it.

Line can be a little long around lunch time but it moves fast.

I like the chicken salad pretzel the best.

Also get a cinnamon and sugar pretzel."}
{"text":"Relatively bad. Pretzels themselves are drab and overly salted, and remarkably tough, but the service is always extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"Definitely a unique location. If you are feeling adventurous, then you may want to try a pretzel sandwich. The first time I ordered a pretzel sandwich I was completely surprised by the sight. I thought I was going to have an ordinary sandwich with some sort of golden crusted bread; I was very wrong. The bread portion of the sandwich was a pretzel cut in half. The key to a good experience is figuring out how to hold the sandwich so that the contents do not fall out."}
{"text":"Amazing pretzels, even better pretzel sandwiches. I moved away from Pittsburgh a few years ago and still reminisce on my times spent here whenever I eat a soft pretzel from anywhere else. I was daydreaming about The Pretzel Shop this very morning and needed an outlet to express my feelings. Thank god for yelp.

(The prices were very reasonable from what I remember.)"}
{"text":"It was really cheap, but just didn't do anything for me when I got the pizza sandwich on a pretzel, of course. Maybe I'll go back and get their regular pretzels."}
{"text":"We moved from Pittsburgh to Seattle a year and a half ago. I make my mother in law come down here every so often and express-mail us a couple dozen to freeze. They're THAT good. I am incapable of going to the South Side without a stop here. (And yes, they freeze well. Not as good as fresh, but you can't get a decent pretzel for love or money on the left coast.)

One tip: if it's before 2pm, don't go in the front door. Walk a block up or down Carson, walk away from the water, and then go down Carey Way, the alley behind it. They have a back entrance that goes straight into the bakery, where you may bask in pretzel-warmth AND buy them right out of the oven. No sandwiches or cookies or drinks back there, just pretzels, but OMG pretzel pretzel pretzel."}
{"text":"I can't rate these guys past their drip coffee and maybe 1 of their confections...but it SMELLS delicious. 

We pop in for a $1.75 coffee now and again. Staff is friendly, fast and courteous. 

There is usually at least 3 other people there and more arrive as we leave. Seems to be a Southside institution!"}
{"text":"Y'know, I have never actually been in this place as it always seems to be closed whenever I venture to the Sahs Syde, but every now and then, someone I know ends up getting pretzels from there for everyone, and they are always tasty either hot or cold. Today someone gave me a couple of the soft pretzel rods, so I figgered it was high time for a Yelp. 

My father grew up in South Side, so the pretzels became a semi-regular treat for us. Once as a child, I was whining and carrying on about something I didn't wanna do or whatever while we were visiting my grandmother when she lived on Sarah Street.  So, to get me to shut up, my mom pulled over on Carson, came out with a brown paper bag, pulled out a South Side pretzel the size of Andre The Giant's hand, and stuffed it in my mouth with a big grin on her face. True story. That was the first time I ever had one; at age 6. There wasn't a peep outta me the rest of the day. 

Hey, eatin' somethin' good is work when yer a kid. Ever hear rugrats carry on when they're eatin' a hot fudge sundae? Dig what I'm sayin'?

I like to bite a chunk off and let it dissolve in my mouth a little. 

These ain't the kind of pretzels you'll find at a department store's snack bar or a ball park concession stand. You don't get that pepper on the bottom, that oven baked flavor that bleeds character, care, and the old-school, that chewy toughness that evokes what South Side used to be; street as hell."}
{"text":"Love this place! Inexpensive. Great for a quick snack mid day. And they have a huge variety of items on their menu"}
{"text":"I've loved the Pretzel Shop for much of my life! We used to have pretzel day in school and we could bring money to buy a twisted soft pretzel from the shop. And my dad would always bring home a big bag full anytime he was working near the South Side shop. 

Now that I'm older, I go in for the awesome sandwiches. It's such a treat to get the chicken salad or just plain old turkey and cheese on a pretzel bun. I always get mine warmed up and usually buy a can of pop with it, then take it to one of the outside tables to people watch while I eat. I almost always can find parking right outside the shop since it's not in the crazy crazy part of East Carson. 

It's such a simple shop, with no gimmicks. I love that. It's a Pittsburgh staple and I hope it's always around!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten one thing from The Pretzel Shop, so my review should be taken with that in mind.

I had the cinnamon sugar pretzel bites. They were the best pretzel-related anything I've ever eaten. Sweet but not too sweet with hint of salt. And bite sized! I tried it with the icing dip, but that made it a bit too sweet for my personal tastes (but it was still good). 

My only reason for giving 4 instead of 5 stars is really arbitrary (and I wish I could give half stars because it's really not worth a full star point deduction). They only take cash. I never carry cash and generally hate having it. But, they have an ATM in the store. This ATM only allows a minimum withdrawal of $20, though. And I paid a little under $3 for my food. Come with cash."}
{"text":"This place is staple and one that I frequented when I lived in Pittsburgh.  The pretzels are always fresh, delicious, and inexpensive. They have a veggie pizza (on pretzel) that is amazing and pretzel dogs. They also have a wide variety of flavors for their pretzels and dipping sauces. When I visit, this is one of the \"must-go\" places for me.

You can't go wrong with The Pretzel Shop/"}
{"text":"Ordered a chipotle turkey pretzel sandwich. Cash only. $4 with tax. They'll ask if you'll want it warmed up or cold, get it warmed up with all the fixings. A bit messy and they did not include a napkin in the to-go bag so make sure you grab one. Other than that the pretzel was everything I imagined it to be - salty and soft which went well the turkey, tomatoes, lettuce and chipotle sauce."}
{"text":"Anytime that I am in the South Side,  I stop here and get a dozen or so of their perfect pretzels.  Never had a bad on here.
Also, occasionally get a sandwich and this one didn't disappoint. Chipotle Turkey on a pretzel of course.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Great spot to pick up a pretzel for a quick, budget-friendly snack. If you're expecting a fresh, high-quality pretzel, you will be disappointed. For $0.60 a piece per plain pretzel, you get what you pay for. They also have a variety of specialty pretzels (a little more expensive but still within $1-2) like jalapeÃ±o and ham & cheese; however, they look like they've been sitting out for a while and unappealing, in my opinion. I tried the plain and pizza pretzels which were decent. They do reheat them in a microwave before serving, but it leaves them a bit chewy."}
{"text":"Best pretzels I have ever had.  Great old school spot.  If you really want then fresh out of the oven, head to the rear entrance on Carey Way early in the morning like my grandpap used to.   Don't yinz bring no credit cards!"}
{"text":"I may be a hypocrite slightly.  I talk about how much I hate sandwiches.  But I think the epidemic in boring sandwiches turned me off.  I've been meeting more and more unboring sammies lately, which has made me actually start to crave them!

I had wanted to stop into The Pretzel Shop for a while and had heard they also serve sandwich and not just pretzels.  They actually have a whole case full of sandwiches and sides.  I opted for the turkey sandwich with horsey dressing on a pretzel bun (dah!).  

That pretzel bun... AMAZING!  It was so moist and doughy, and not too salty (which I hate about regular ones).  I also loved the tangy dressing.  It honestly made me want to come back and buy up the whole store of pretzels, that bun was so good!  You could probably buy the whole store for $20 everything is so cheap, cheap, cheap!

I'll be back now for my new pretzel sandwich habit, and probably a developing pretzel habit.  All thanks to The Pretzel Shop!"}
{"text":"Fantastic value for quick and tasty treats for lunch! Stopped by here on a busy Saturday afternoon and was impressed with the range of sandwich offerings and variations of pretzels. For a mere 6$ my family of three ordered a gyro pretzel and 2 pizza pretzels which were all really tasty and filling. Although we were eating a light lunch in between other stops, the pretzels were satisfying. The line was full of regulars and it's clear from the efficient and friendly service that The Pretzel Shop has a great business model. I totally understand why this is a popular establishment and am hoping to return. Also, for those traveling with little ones, this place is toddler-approved!"}
{"text":"i'm not sure what i love about this place.  but every visit to pittsburgh seems to include a stop by this cheap take-out eatery on the southside.

its menu is simple:  pretzels.  you can get a bag of five hot, soft pretzels for $2.  however, the main attraction are its pretzel sandwiches.  the choices vary depending on the day, such as chicken salad, the club, buffalo chicken, tuna fish and more!  that said, the owner is sweet and made me a custom order of buffalo chicken once because of an undying craving.  the price varies based on whats in between the pretzels, but they all seem to be little more than $2.  yes, this place is CHEAP.

there's no where to sit down.. and there can be a line during prime lunch hours.  but if you love pretzels, this unique eatery is worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Ham and cheese pretzel with a Colteryahn iced tea. That is all you need.  Also, don't forget to hit up the back door in Carey Way for all of the pretzels that look a little strange, but taste the same as all the others. All you can fit in a bag for practically nothing."}
{"text":"Have loved them since they were sold on the corner by Southside high school in the 80s! Still the best!!!"}
{"text":"This place makes some good chewy pretzels and the prices are ridiculously reasonable.  I liked the pretzels so much that I ate 5 of the 6 I bought within an hour...I was trying to save them for later, but things like this happen when food is addictive and good."}
{"text":"I heard about this place when I moved to Pittsburgh and everyone said that you had to go there and get Pretzels. Well I did and I don't see why everyone likes it so much. 

Don't get me wrong the Pretzels are good, but it's not life altering in anyway. 

My major beef with this place is their breakfast pretzel. It's like a salty sweet soft pretzel that is meant for breakfast. I think they are kind of gross. They seem to use regular table salt and sugar and the salt over powers the sugar and just tastes like a really salty soft pretzel. Which in my mind is not good for breakfast at all. 

When people at work get them and if I'm really hungry I have to say to myself before taking a bite \"salt...it's going to be salty\" and then take a bit. Else it takes me by surprise every time. 

Maybe I'm wrong, so try it for yourself"}
