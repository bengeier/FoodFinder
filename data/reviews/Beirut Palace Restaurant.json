{"text":"Beirut Palace is one of those places I want to like more than I actually do.  The staff have always been lovely, since my first visit there when I moved here almost three years ago.  But while the concept is great, and a good fit for the Bloorcourt neighborhood, I have to say that the execution here is perpetually flawed.  Specializing in \"Middle Eastern food\", the menu is broken down by region - Greek, Lebanese, Turkish -  to offer up more than just your generic falafel and shawarma entries in the field.    In the three or so years since I first went to Beirut Palace, the only change they have undergone is to really push their offering of \"Shisha on the patio\" in huge, obnoxious signage.  The food is decent, but incredibly slow to come to you - it doesn't seem to make a difference if you come in at lunch, dinner, or late night, they are at least consistent in that.  The food can be quite tasty, but more than once I have been underwhelmed or plain unhappy with a dish that has been served me, so I wonder if they have a problem with kitchen staff turnover.  Their patio is very nice but again, watch out for all the shisha if you're smoke sensitive."}
{"text":"Great location, great space and it brings out the latent urban planner in me; every time I walk by I wish it was something else.    My first time in was sort of a double whammy; the place was filled with an acrid smoke (no, not a rogue shisha...) and I had just returned from Dubai and Qatar - so the bar was set a bit on the high side.  Recognizing this, I decided to give them another shot.  No smoke but the food was even worse.    Essentially this place has an bland generic approach bounded by an undifferentiated menu, punctuated with uninspired versions of food done better pretty much everywhere in the neighborhood and certainly in the city.    I'm left with the overwhelming sense that this place could and should be better, but that no one wants to take in the necessary dose of tough love to make that happen."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now for late night dinners, and have been pretty impressed on both occasions. The dishes really stand out from your typical middle eastern fare with great flavour and are a cut above in quality, too.  My only complaint are the mountainous portions, as most times I can't help myself and eat everything I'm served. It's my sincere wish that restaurants across North America would stop distinguishing themselves with obesity-inducing amounts of food piled onto a single plate, and yes, Beirut, I'm looking at you and your delicious food."}
{"text":"This was the shisha spot for the night. Don't let the sign outside that says \"$15 for shisha + $9 for each extra head\" fool you. The \"head\" refers to another head of shisha leaves (or whatever) not another person. So its pretty reasonably priced.  The food there is also surprisingly good. We ordered some hummus with lamb and beef and it was quite tasty. Comes with pita bread and pickled turnips (got to have pickles!). Next time I would probably just get the lamb. They have a deal on their appetizers where you can get any 2 or 3 of them for a fixed price. Saves you a few bucks if you go with a bunch of people depending on which ones you order.  They have a bunch of fruit flavoured shisha like grape, cherry, apple, and also some mixed ones like some kind of fruit punch type flavour and something minty. Fairly typical I think (I'm no shisha expert - I almost started a fire!)  They have a really nice patio there but pity the surrounding area is kind of dull so it doesn't make for particularly interesting people watching.  Oh yeah, extra points for being open late :) til 3am I think."}
