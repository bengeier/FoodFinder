{"text":"Never thought I'd make a trip to the mall with the sole intent to eat. Ate here after boyfriend raving about a great Keto/ low carb friendly spot. Cannot beat price you can get salad, pizza and a drink for 10.95+tax. Pizza was crispy and tasty. Good quality salad greens available as well. Much needed addition to SouthPark food court. California pizza should probably just shut down and make room for another restaurant."}
{"text":"Gusto brings a much-needed \"healthy\" and farm fresh option to the Southpark Mall food court. And, for the most part, it does not disappoint. Their menu boasts a nice selection of pizzas and salads, all of which look good. I opted for the Farmer's Daughter pizza. The girl taking my order was nice enough, and the guys working there seemed happy and energetic (despite that I was there ~15 minutes before close). It did take a few minutes to get my food, especially compared to the true fast food that most other stalls offer in the food court. But soon enough I had the food in my hands!  The pizza was pretty good. For the most part, it seemed fresh. The tomatoes were pretty soggy, though. There was also a LOT of the oil/pesto/? dressing on my pizza (will ask for it lightly dressed next time). So my pizza was kinda soggy and wet- at least the crust held up! The cheese was great, though. I love me some fresh mozzarella! Overall, the pizza is definitely a step down from similar pizza joint &pizza (same flash fired concept). I will try a salad next time. Also, side note, my sweet tea was REALLY sweet. Usually sweet is okay with me, but this was just so so sweet that I could only take a few sips.   Gusto is great if you are looking for a healthy ish option at the food court (and don't want to go to Panera...). I would definitely recommend eating it there (especially for pizzas) so your pizza does not get too soggy. Try it!"}
{"text":"Oh my... so impressed. Non GMO with some organic options AND cauliflower crust pizza! Sign me up immediately. Was in the Southpark mall food court and saw this place for the first time. Had a cauliflower crust pizza with crab and a salad with watermelon, mint and beets. Paired this with a hibiscus lemonade. Everything was awesome! Reasonably priced also. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This review is based off the preview day were everything on the menu was free.   The food was delicious! We ordered 2 Plain Janes, 2 Street lunches (Thai Crunch Salad add blackened shrimp and seasonal Obey the Claw pizza and Local Farmers salad add blackened chicken with 4 Little Pig pizza) and 1  Bleu Ribbon salad. We also were able to try the blueberry soda, the watermelon hibiscus lemonade and the apple kale drink.   I ordered the Obey the Claw on the cauliflower crust and really enjoyed it. The pizza was a little spicy and you couldn't even tell it was cauliflower crust. My salad had good flavor as well. I probably won't order the shrimp again because they were cold and I'm not a big seafood person. There were also radishes in the salad that I picked out. Didn't really add anything to the salad for me.   The kids loved their Plain Jane pizza and their blueberry sodas. My mom's salad the Bleu Ribbon salad was the star. I think it the creamy balsamic dressing!!! I have to go back and order it and I will pay to add the steak!!!   I wasn't a fan of the seasonal drinks. Hey we're both very tart to me. I prefer the blueberry soda.   Service was great and they even had employees helping customers in the food court and getting refills on drinks. Not sure if this was due to the long line or will be a permanent service.   All in all I was very impressed and super happy to have Gusto in the South Park Mall food court.

{"text":"This gem popped up outta nowhere.  I brought the obey the claw...my goodness was it delicious. Quick and worth 10$. They had so many different choices it was hard to choose. Vegetarian and vegan options available. Flavors are endless and you'll wish you had more. Thought writing this while eating would slow my eating it didn't only slowed my post. Shop then eat at Gusto."}
