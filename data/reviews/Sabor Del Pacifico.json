{"text":"If this guy is the same owner of the same restaurant by the same name located on Bloor and Dufferin: do not waste you time or money!  Rude service and mediocre food...and take it from me, I'm Colombian and would want nothing more than to promote our establishments.    Most of the food on the menu was not available. We ordered what was offered as the \"daily specials\", a coffee and juice.  The food took forever and when I asked for an extra plate, the owner/chef/waiter rolled his eyes and huffed! I think the guy was under staffed because when I asked for our beverages, he snapped: \"I told you I was busy!   I don't know if I could get them for you!!!\" We only stayed because the food was served, we were hungry,  and we had already waited close to an hour.  Believe me, I was tempted to go to the convenience store next door and buy a drink to have with my meal!  I will NEVER set foot in this person's establishment ever again. I would rather eat beef jerky at the park and trust me, i'd be happier!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for dinner.  I pass this place often on the way to work and I was taken in by the bright sign and the promise of good Colombian food, which I've never had.   Note, this isn't the place to hit if you're in a rush or super duper hungry. Everything takes a while, from getting your drinks, to your food, to your bill.   The Hubster ordered the Pechuga a la Cazuela con Arroz, Papas Fritas y Ensalada, which was chicken in a wine sauce with rice and fries. He really really enjoyed this. I ordered the Bandeja Colombiana which was a couple strips of steak, one strip of pork belly, a Colombian sausage, a fried egg on rice and plantains, avocado and salad. The meat was kind of overcooked. The steak was chewy and the pork belly was just hard. It was tough to eat. The flavour was there, though. The rice was great, as was the sausage.The beans were INCREDIBLE. The salad on both our meals was kind of wilty and the iceberg lettuce variety.  All in all, it wasn't anything super special, but the portions were very good for the price. I'd be inclined to go back and check it out again."}
{"text":"I love the food in this place. The Bandeja Paisa is my favorite. Luis (The Owner) is a great person and always comes out to say hi and welcome you. Empenadas to as starters are a great choice and the Sancocho de pescado is amazing!!!!"}
