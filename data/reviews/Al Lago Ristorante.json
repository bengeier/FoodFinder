{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. I highly recommend dinner at Al Lagos. The welcome you get from The Owner (host/waiter/chef) is amazing. So warm and friendly. I have been a few times and the food just gets better and better.  There is no menu but you can order anything you want, and the prices are very reasonable. A great place for a romantic dinner or a group dinner as well!   AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This isn't your average restaurant; if you're looking for a interesting dinning experience be sure to check this place out, there is no menu!! It's the strangest feeling being seated and not being handed a menu! But at the same time I know you're hoping to ask for your favourite Italian dish and being able it get it! This place is a one man show, you get literally get whatever you are in the mood for and not having to worry if it will be on the menu or not, it's truly a hidden gem! I ordered veal parmigiana and Penne pasta which were both excellent. I would recommend coming to this place just once to see how nice and accommodating it is and I'm sure you'll fall in love with the owner, he is very nice !!"}
