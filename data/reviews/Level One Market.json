{"text":"Quaint little market, service was kind and quick. But for selection, it was clear they attempted variation but did not succeed. Definitely could have had more products for sale.  Overall, great place to visit for quick snacks, but don't expect to see a lot of items"}
{"text":"This place is really convenient to me, however there food seems out of date.  I got the protein bowl consistng of 2 hard boiled eggs, squared cheese and crackers.  The cheese was slimy and the eggs tasted spoiled.  The egg was so bad i spit it out.  Macaroni salad dressing was also spoiled last tme i was there."}
{"text":"EL DORADO!  I work at Collier and frequently visit L1M for coffee, soda, or an occasional sandwich.  It's quick, easy, inexpensive.  However, on this particular Thursday, I took a chance on the daily special, the El Dorado grilled sandwich. I selected marble rye, and pepper jack cheese to go with the roast beef and roasted green chili's.  I must point out that this was not a sandwich I would normally select. Chicken and turkey are my main options.   The sandwich was ready in minutes, and came with a selection of one side.  I chose potato salad.   The El Dorado was amazing!  The perfect balance of roast beef slices, green chili slices, and very melted cheese. The grilling was great. No sloppy dressing pouring out of the edges, crispy, and wrapped in what appeared to be parchment, yo keep it crispy.   WOW!  I've had good, mediocre, and really bad sandwiches.  This was the second one that was GREAT. If you don't stop by and try this Shame!  Shame! Shame!  It's amazing"}
{"text":"This \"market\" is also a small sandwich shop that has some of the best tuna salad I have ever tasted.  Same for their potato salad, which I rarely order in a restaurant because I'm very picky -- this stuff is the bomb.  They make a lot of thinks from scratch, which is surprising because this place is so small!"}
