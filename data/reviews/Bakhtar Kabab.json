{"text":"Amazing food, a lot better than some of the other more hyped afghani restaurants in GTA!"}
{"text":"I was looking for some new Afghan restaurant to go to and then I found this location. Run by husband and wife opened the doors 4 years back. They were friendly, service was a little slow but the main reason they lost a star was because their menu was a little confusing.   Went with few people so we got to order multiple things. The order was for a Shawarma Special (Chicken Shawarma and kofta kabob), Sultani Kabob (Chicken kabob and chicken kofta), Babori Kabob (Tikka Kabob and Kofta Kabob), Waziri Kabob (Chicken breast and chicken kofta) and half chicken.   All kababs were very well marinated and cooked. I enjoyed the Shawarma Special the most. The portions were decent. What I liked the most was that their spices were a little different the other Afghan restaurants in the area. They do give naan with the meals but they don't make their naans  in house.  Overall, good experience.   For my Muslim bro and sis - They serve halal food at this location"}
{"text":"Had Afghanistani food first time good flavour the chef is very humble when u speak to him can't say much about the wife lol she needs a little PR training  Honestly good well cooked food"}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice family owned business, the lamb chops are amazing but actually everything is amazing. They only lost one point because they don't give enough sauce and charge for extra sauce. Makes you feel uncomfortable when you ask. Prices are more than bamiyan , pamier and khandahar but the taste is better so I don't mind the price. Must try! They just need to stop charging for a few sauces"}
{"text":"Best afghani restaurant in Mississauga. Family run and reasonable prices. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great food. Enjoyed the kofta kabob and the bakhatar Kabob. The bolani had good flavor. In the future I would have them forget the sumac on the kabob."}
{"text":"Kofta Kabob was good; Tikka Kabob was the best I've ever had. I'll be back next time I'm in Brampton."}
{"text":"I was at Bakhtar Kabab and savored a very delicious and healthy dinner served by a very hospitable, courteous, cheerful, and efficient motherly Afghan lady who brought the wonderful meal right to my table. I ordered Laghman Kabob Combo, which is succulent lamb chops, flavorful kofta kabob, fragrant rice, piping-hot naan bread, colorful salad, and two tasty sauces. Very high quality food in very generous portions at very good prices. The atmosphere is very home-like and cozy. Big screen TV on site. The interior is immaculately clean and has lots of tables. Great location, plenty of parking, bus shelter stop very nearby. My sincere thanks to the wonderful staff for making my first visit a very enjoyable one and I look forward to continue dining at your great establishment on an ongoing basis. God Bless."}
{"text":"I'm a regular mainly because to food is very good for the very affordable price.  I've only had schwarma wraps and plate so far, but that is changing.  Family owned and operated, it caters to Muslim and Pakistani community, but is extremely welcoming to everyone.  They could be successful anywhere, but being in an industrial area choices are few and we're lucky to have them here"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday for late lunch with a few friends. Found great reviews of them on google maps so decided to check them out.  We got there just after they opened. It has a very clean and spacious seating area plus a lounge area for shisha (we speculate that's what it's for), humbly decorated. Service was very friendly and great too. The food is really delicious and fresh! As other reviews mentioned, their bbq and grill are amazing! I ordered the lamb and Kebob combo and shared it with a friend (can't exactly fill two people, but more than enough for one person). The meat was really tender, well seasoned and falls right off the bone.  The salad that came in the combo was very fresh.  Because they were great on all points, 5 stars :)  Would definately recommend and go back again!"}
{"text":"Not as flavorful as the other Afghani competitors...but worth a shot plus it was close to work"}
