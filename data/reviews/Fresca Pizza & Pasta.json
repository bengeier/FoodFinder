{"text":"The pizza is super delish. The slices are big but thin. However, it's pretty cheap. 

Service is okay. The guy working there apparently doesn't washes his hands, but who really knows."}

Fun fact: The previous pizza shop at this location was featured on the Canadian Restaurant Makeover. 

Do not expect much service from this pizza place. I am not sure if it was a language barrier or the male cashier was just grumpy.
I got a slice of freshly baked pizza after a 5 min wait and it was awesome! The crust was thin and crunch but not overcooked.

Tip: Try the pesto sauce on the pizza.

Avoid looking too closely at the place, it could use some serious scrubbing."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have ever had! I would never eat here again. It was dry and stale, disgusting!"}
{"text":"The customer services stinks. The owner is a terrible, rude, monster, and uncivilized peasant."}
{"text":"Reliable and very tasty basic pizza.

Where most corner places try to hide a flavourless bread-like thick dough with excessive amounts of dubious toppings, Fresca keeps it straight with a thinner crust and basic toppings for when you want a good bite.

Their garlic basil oil (which goes on the margherita) packs a lot of flavour and keeps me coming back to it as my go-to weekend slice.

The last t-shirt I saw on the owner tells you about the no-fuss service: \"Do I look like I am a people person?\". But that does not detract from the most important thing which is their food.

Although it works as your pizza-after-heavy-drinking option, unlike most other places in the neighbourhood, it also works when you are completely sober and can actually tell good from bad."}
{"text":"Housed in the same location as the previously owned Massimo's pizza, this is the only place to get the best Margarita.  The owners are the same people who used to work for Massimo's.  There's no point going to the new Massimo's location because it's not the same people who used to make it, go to Fresca.

Pizza is thin and beautiful, they brush garlic oil on the Margarita or if you want on any other pizza.  Definitely worth a try"}
{"text":"I love this place. Best margherita pizza with their garlic and parsley oil! Not too salty, just the right amount of crisp pizza dough edges without it being too thick. Can never just have one slice."}
{"text":"They wouldn't accept a takeout order two hours before closing because they \"ran out of dough\"."}
{"text":"Just had frescas pizza for the first time!!!! It was amazing. One of the best in the city! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"No they don't have a fancy wood burning oven shipped from Italy and hand assembled here.  

There are no hipsters or cool kids like Libretto or Queen Margherita hanging out on a Friday night.  There are no craft beers on tap.  No menus and ingredients that change with the seasons.  No fancy decor, nothing really.  

You are however going to wonder why is a little place at the corner of College and Robert so busy?  Why does the owner look so stressed out all the time?  What do other people know that you don't?  

Now if they only had something with anchovies....it'd be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Solid pizza. Maybe slightly on the rich side but sometimes that's what you're looking for! Went for this when Pizzaiolo was closed last night and was very happy with the decision."}
{"text":"I can't even review my food because it's been TWO HOURS since I ordered it and the guy never came. I called the restaurant and all she said was sorry and that he left twenty minutes ago. I pre-paid on JustEat.ca so I won't even get my money back. Never ordering from here again. Better off taking that $30 and burning it in a cooking pot. It's literally the more sensible option.

Update:

Okay, I used JustEat help's service (a live \"chat\" via messaging system). Thank you to Seghen for reimbursing me and also giving me a voucher.

The driver of the restaurant was a total thug and called to yell at me for getting him into trouble. Called again after I hung up and boasted \"Oh you're too scared to answer now!\" Um, yes crazy person. I am scared. What a bully!! Never ever dealing with this restaurant again and you can be sure I won't let anyone I know go here either. What a psycho!"}
{"text":"I wholeheartedly agree with all the five-star reviews on here and don't need to add much about the pizza and how delicious and garlicky it is. 

but I wanted to mention that I just tried their calzone, after being a long-time fan of their pizza, and if you are debating getting one the next time you're hungrier than a slice, DO IT. if you love the pizza, you'll love the calzone. I got the pesto one and just added tomato sauce, which made it essentially like their margarita slice doused with their garlic-oil pesto, with chewy, scrumptious dough and lots of cheese. you can add any toppings you like -- I opted to keep it simple. cheap (7.50 tax in) and super-filling.

and I mean, if their pizza is not for you, you might not agree with my assessment of the calzone. also, what the hell is wrong with you?"}
{"text":"absolutely love the margarita pizza here. And super reasonable. Get the slices for best experience"}
{"text":"Took almost 2 hours for delivery on a regular Saturday night (placed order at 8pm and we are a 10min drive from the place). Expected delivery time was 1hour... Delivery guy came with no receipt for us to sign even though we ordered with a credit card, and had his hand out for a tip (which we gave). 

Pizza was ok (thin crust) but honestly, Pizza Pizza has better pizza.  Pasta was ok but a bit greasy. 

Overall, passable food, but would not order from again because of the very long delivery time (it's not worth the wait). It would be a better place to walk in and get a slice. definitely not a place to order delivery."}
{"text":"I am extremely impressed with this restaurant.
I ordered from here last night on justeat.ca and has a really great experience. 
The food was really delicious and for a GREAT price!!!!
The portions were large and the food arrived HOT and on time.
I have zero complaints about my experience, I highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"hubby and I are addicted to there vodka fussili but if your looking for pleasant service this is not the place. They almost seem mad you called, but in the end you get your take out, it tastes good and that good enough."}
{"text":"Fresca's pizza was a disappointment, I'm sorry to say. The quality of the pizza at Pizza Gigi and Papa Ceo's has become undependable, so I have been looking for a new local. The positive reviews on this site suggested I'd found it, but not so. We ordered two medium pizzas for delivery last evening: a Margherita and a Diavolo (sausage and hot peppers). The crust was okay - just okay, nothing more - but the toppings left a great deal to be desired. The sauce on the Margherita was wonderfully garlicky, yes, but there was a very thin scraping of it on the pizza, and not much cheese at all. And the Diavolo toppings consisted of a few admittedly VERY hot peppers and a very few, very thin slices of sausage. The people we dealt with - the woman on the phone and the delivery driver - were pleasant and efficient, and the pizza arrived in good time, but my search for a new local will have to continue, because I won't be ordering from Fresca again."}
{"text":"I just found my go-to for a cheap slice of pizza. It's $3.50 per slice and you get to choose from three different types all made from a thin crust. I had the Margherita and it was sublime! Tons of nice subtle flavours. I think I could eat a whole pizza here if I wanted to."}
{"text":"The owner of Fresca was a long time employee of Massimo's Pizza and did an excellent job where Massimo's left off here.    You will not find a better tasting pizza slice in the city.   I'm torn as to which is better since they're very similar in taste.    

Have the Margarita slice and a pop for under $5."}
{"text":"Margarita is the best!!  The garlic basil topping is phenomenal.  It would be a 5-star if only they weren't so stingy!  One extra large pizza should come with one container of jalapeños.  I order regularly and order 2-3 pies at a time for staff or family, yet getting a container of jalapeños per each pie is like asking them give up a kidney!

It's not complicated, one pie = one jalapeño container.  Charge for extra for any additional ones.  I keep going back bc the pies are so good.  But if someone else figures out their recipe I'd leave in a heartbeat just bc of their cheapo attitude.

Overall, the best of this style of pizza in the city I've come across and definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fresh ingredients, fast service, and amazing prices. We walked over there from our hotel, and when they guy asked us where we were going, he was shocked at how far we walked, so he offered to drive us back to our hotel for free! Stand up service. Would go again."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. No customer service. Cold face owener. not very clean.but for 3.50 per slice maybe that's what you get."}
{"text":"This place is really quite good, esp in relation to the bread and cheese wedge bakeries that are a little too common around here. I'm looking at you guys on the corner of Spadina and Harbord. Crimes against pizza, I say! Crimes!

I'm new to the area and I'm big on my NY style pizza as a Northern NJ native.  Of the 5 or so places I've tried in this neighborhood just to the west of U of T, this is probably my favorite so far. It's really quite close to an authentic NY pie based on what I understand Toronto standards to be. I thought the garlic oil was an interesting touch, but pizza is already a greasy food - do we need to add more grease on top? How about some garlic powder? Same difference. 

I got one more on the list (Amato) to try but this one probably won't go below #2, and def not below #3 in this area. Pizza Gigi is also high on the current list but probably behind this place."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem where you can get the best cheap pizza you will ever have in Toronto"}
{"text":"love the garlic oil, love the jalapeños, love the crust, and love the price!"}
{"text":"Tried it today.  This pizza did not hold up to the reviews on here.  Bitondo is better and it's close enough to Fresca.  This is not New York pizza. If you go there with this expectation you will be disappointed.  Pizza Nova is better too."}
{"text":"Ever since Massimos shut down, I've been coming here.  It is the closest thing to a Massimos slice.  Fresca's slices are large, thin and nice and garlicky.  Love it! The owners aren't as friendly though, but who cares when I get exactly what I am craving."}
{"text":"I'm hooked on their margherita pizza. A friend of mine told me to try it cause they love it and I'm eternally grateful that they let me in on this info. I couldn't convert my family who love lots of toppings but they always enjoy their pizza too. It's really good for the price they charge."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best pizza I've ever had. I've never had any but the Margherita, which is such a simple pizza, but it is so exquisite here, you don't need anything else. My standards for pizza have been raised and I won't be frequenting elsewhere.

plus free delivery!"}
{"text":"What I like about this place is that after a fire a few years ago, nothing has changed except the name. Same pizza slices, same people running the place, same toppings on the counter, same smell hits you as you enter, and same casualness out front with the mixed shade and sun with enough of a nook you can roll up on a bicycle, use the side stand, and mosey on in for a slice. The slices are margarita, deluxe, or pepperoni. $3.50 each and they are satisfying, full of flavour, a crust that you can chew, and you can add those tempting toppings on the counter like the oily goodness of olive oil infused with basil, or pickled jalapeños, encrusted with chili peppers. It's close to U of T and even closer to Lord Lansdowne school so beware there could be traffic jams at lunch time. Love those onions on the deluxe!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a pizza specialist...my last meal would be a perfect slice of ...Fresca comes very close to a perfect slice...great price for what your getting..

Chef"}
{"text":"i don't know about world hunger, but this solved my hunger. this pizza DOES NOT TASTE LIKE CARDBOARD. Try for yourself."}
{"text":"Really nice pizza slice. The Margaretta is really nice and I usually brush the slice with lots of oil. Very tasty and well priced. Definitely one of the best slices in town."}
{"text":"Ordered the veal sandwich and 3-toppings pizza (pepperoni, bacon, mushrooms). The sandwich was just ok. The veal was super chewy at times, but the jalapeños gave it a nice kick. The pizza was pretty standard but Fresca is definitely not stingy with the toppings. Each slice was packed with them.

The food was good (not great) but the delivery service was horrible. I put in an order from Just Eat at 6:56 PM and after 1.5 hours, I inquired about the delivery status and was told the restaurant \"never received the order.\" This seemed a bit odd since I got the confirmation email that the restaurant DID get my order and the estimated time of delivery was 7:55 PM. Eventually I did get the delivery. At 9:34 PM.

Overall, I'm still trying to find THE pizza place that'll become my regular go-to for delivery, but Fresca is definitely not it."}
{"text":"The pizza was awesome. A very big piece for only a little money, but we came in 1.5 hours before closing, and there was only one piece left and it didn't seem like they were willing to make more even though there were two of us. It was a very weird experience."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Their sauce is excellent and the food is fresh.  Also nice and easy on the wallet.  I order their vegi and always enjoy it. 

Service is good not overly friendly but they do their job and the order comes pretty quickly."}
{"text":"This had been my go-to pizza joint for sometime now. But Fresca, I am exploring other pizza places now. Its not me, its definitely you. But I hope we can remain friends.  

I have tried a couple of pizzas here, but they make a damn good Margherita pizza. Combined with their garlic-basil oil, its damn near perfection. Their other pizzas are just average. So my MO was. just take a slice or two of margherita and enjoy it pipping hot. But the last 2 times I was there, it looked as if the slices had gotten much smaller.

I will still come back for a slice for the margherita if I am in the area, but apart from that, I think our relation has run its course."}
{"text":"As an ex inhabitant of Montreal, this is by far the best pizza I've eaten since being back in Ontario. When you start drooling talking about a certain dish or food you know you're either A) Hungry B) Fat C) Must be some really good pizza and this is. My house mate that doesn't eat pizza ever now has a craving for frescas margaritas pizza because its that good. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but a 2 HOUR WAIT for delivery on two pizzas???  I'm not even 2km from your store and was originally quoted 45 minutes.  I figured, it's a Saturday night...  That's not bad.  Then an hour later I call them and they say they're working on the order.  Too many customers walking in.  Give them another 30 minutes.  So here I am waiting in my hotel lobby waiting for the pizzas.  I call again.  They say the driver left 20 minutes ago.  I say BS.  Then they ask me to hold...  For another 5 minutes.  I call back, they say the driver should be there any minute and they offer 1/2 price on the order.  That was 10 minutes ago.  I asked them if they have other orders to deliver.  They say no.  Should be here by now, right?!?  NOPE."}
{"text":"I know this corner has been a bit jinxed for pizza parlours that have been here through the decades.  If I`m not mistaken this location was even featured one on of those restaurant makeover shows.

Now it`s owned by a Vietnamese mom and pop shop.  It may not be mind blowing \"authentic\" pizza, but it`s a solid honest one that I`ll take over some corporate `za any day.

The inside`s gotta a bit of charm to it as well."}
{"text":"Probably one of the better slices you can get in the city, especially if you put the garlic oil that they have on the side all over it. Slices are huge and is usually fresh cause they're always replenishing them! 

Service is super friendly and they're also family-ran, place is usually kept pretty clean but it's mainly a take out  joint. 

Pretty bang for your buck one slice is usually good for me . 

Would recommend if you're in the area over every other pizza place in proximity."}
{"text":"Late night pizza bites or quick lunch on campus. Will beat those pizza cravings without beating the wallet.

2/5 - Venue
4/5 - Food
3/5 - Overall

I've visited multiple times, whether for a study snack while on campus or after a late night and looking to fulfill those munchie cravings.

Venue: The venue is nothing spectacular. The inside houses a small ledge and several tables for you to eat at. The front might make you turn away with the broken glass that seems to remain unfixed after many months. The back of the building is a bit messy with open cloests and various mops and junk lying around. The tables are slightly dirty, as you would expect from a late night pizza joint.

Food: The pizza is very good for the price of $3.75. I've tried their pepperoni and margherita slices, and both were very good. The cheese is perfectly caramelized, and the pepperoni is at the right amount of crispiness. The margherita had fresh basil, and a rich tomato marinara. Both slices were served on a thin crust, that has the perfect amount of crunch. No bloated puffy dough here.

Overall: Service can be lackluster, and seem unfriendly at times. Often the pizza is not reheated enough (maybe 30 seconds in the oven), so ask them to keep it in the oven longer before serving it to you."}
{"text":"I've stopped by here a couple times now for a margherita slice. I really like the thin crust and the garlic oil they put on top, and the price is great considering how big the slices are. It's on a corner so there isn't a lot of seating space inside, I only just beat the rush for a table last time. Service was decent enough-the staff weren't the warmest I've ever met, but they weren't really rude either. Hope to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Had friends who used my app from Durham region and we were at the Chelsea hotel but the delivery guy was very rude and kept sighing being impatient because my friend had changed clothes and had accidentally forgot his wallet in the other clothes...also the delivery guy couldn't even come to the door! The guy wouldn't have waited so long if he came to the door in the first damn place."}
{"text":"taste wise - this is probably the best thin crust pizza I've had in town.  And the crust has flavour.  The crust tastes like bread.  I want my pizza to taste like it had yeast in it and so even if it's thin, there's chewiness like bread.   I find all the other thin crust pizza pies out there are tasteless, lack chewiness more like a cut above baking pita bread into pizza.   I've been to Via Merchanti and Dovercourt Village PIzza.  I can't remember if I ate pizza a Libretto, I just know I've been there.  
I went there because there's always people outside of it and I was curious as I did like Massimo's pizza especially his margharita slice and haven't found one I like since. Then I read  an article that these guys used to work for them.  So of course, it tastes like Massimo's so if you were into their pizza. Well come get it!  it was $3.50 taxes in for the slice.  

The negatives:  
A lousy selection of slices. When I went, there was 1 cheese slice left! and when I left they had just baked a pepperoni pizza.  that's it?  so selection sucks  I can see that being a source of disappointment.   is it's margherita or pepperoni...gotta love those otherwise you're SOL!
several people commented on cleanliness, yes I noticed that too.  after handling money , he took a pizza out and cut it...then washed his hands to make the next pizza.  I'm not that paranoid but hey some people are.
friendliness factor...yup.  remind me of first generation immigrants who are not that comfortable in their new country.  They are cordial enough for me but not good at making people feel welcome if you need that.  I come for the food.  I'm used to eat at chinese restaurants where the service was awful but the food was good.  I am always about the food so if you need the other stuff, then just be forewarned before you go."}
{"text":"Fantastic regular-style pizza; very nice sauce. And it's not expensive. They delivered an XL for about $20 the other day!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good enough service is fast but nothing spectacular. I drove over here from the suburbs because I was in the mood for delicious pizza I was a bit disappointed. It's definitely not the best pizza I've ever had but it's pretty good pizza for the price although the price has gone up from 350 to 375 per slice. The calzone was really good and flavorful but the regular slice was so so. The garlic oil on top was delicious!"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite pizza place in Toronto! The owners may seem terse at first but if you come enough they really soften. Now every time I come the owner brings out fresh chilis because he knows how much I love them."}
{"text":"You would think much of this place looking from the outside but it's a solid value when you are hungry and need a quick bite.  It's $3.50 for a healthy slice of pizza.

The pizza dough is like like a neapoltian pizza so be careful when lifting the whole slice into your gob.  I tried the pepperoni and veggie slices and it was satisfying.  I couldn't get enough of the basil garlic olive oil dipping sauce they have on side for customers.  They offer a brush so you can brush the infusion onto your slice but I really wish they offered a spoon so i can put some of the garlic and basil bits of goodness right onto my slice. :-)"}
{"text":"I recently moved from New York and this is the first pizza I've had in Toronto where I want to go back! No points for atmosphere, but I'll definitely return for the pizza. Yum."}
{"text":"Veal sandwich delivery? Don't mind if I do!
The end results was a slightly dry but adequate form of sustenance delivered to my door as I required.

One thing that did miss the mark was the calzone we ordered along with it. Their calzone menu is very limited and specific, didn't seem to have the ability to order it custom (when using justeat.ca anyways).

Overall not bad, seems I'll have to try the actual pizza next time based on other reviews to have my socks knocked off."}
{"text":"Service is far from friendly and the food isn't great. Had the margherita and deluxe pizza slice along with a margherita calzone. With a can of pop, the total came to about $16. 

The pizzas weren't particularly flavourful despite the abundance of garlic, and could've used a touch more salt. The calzone was made to order which I liked. Similar to the pizzas, it lacked flavour. The one bite I had that contained fresh basil was tasty, but it definitely needed more basil.

I was directed downstairs for the washroom, but the door was locked. When I told the woman working there, she simply said \"no, it isn't\". Thinking I somehow couldn't figure out the door, I went to try it again. Yup, locked. A man working there then confirmed to her that it was indeed locked and then proceeded to unlock the door for me. The basement/washroom smelt super moldy. Would not recommend going down there. 

Overall, this place was nothing special and the cold, borderline rude service is definitely not worth returning for."}
{"text":"One of the best Pizza Margherita in town. Hands down!!  Excellent crust crunch, Right amount of basil tomato sauce, cheesey, Don't miss out on the Garlic oil, BIG slices. Oh, did I mention that those bad boys are for $3.50 a slice?! A must-try pizza place in town. P.S The staff is 1 star  and infrastructure is kinda just okay. I'm sure many will agree on that. I so want to love you guys but with that lazy, rigid, rude attitude is kinda stopping me."}
{"text":"Went there late one night and fortunately it was open. The slice of pizza is quite inexpensive but extremely delicious. They have this oil with some green sauce that works best on the margherita pizza. But that shouldn't stop you from smearing it on any other pizza slice as well."}
{"text":"One of few Margherita pizzas I trust. It's the only flavour I would strongly recommend. Plus, that amazing garlic oil... slather that on at the end and enjoy it with a brio!! So good. Thanks for being so great Fresca!"}
{"text":"No rating. This restaurant is a rip off. I called in and ordered a pasta and 2 sodas. Had ordered from them before. I asked if there is a delivery charge ( I live close by). They said no minimum. 5 minutes later my phone rang and they told me the cost would be $6.00 higher then the original total....THEY ARE LIARS...I cancelled my order...They decided that my simple order wasn't good enough. I am a chef. I know the \"inside scoop\" on running a restaurant. I will NEVER EVER order from them again AND I WILL tell others about this crappy place."}
{"text":"Darn you fresca!  Your service is always meh, but your marherita here is so good!

They are thin, sometimes I wish I could polish two slices but afterwards the garlic basil aftertaste gives me pizza regret.

Still, I love you!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Toronto. The pizzas are just the right thickness for me and cooked so that the bottom is crispy while the rest of the pizza is soft and not overcooked. The dough is done really well here. Great pasta too. A friendly Vietnamese couple runs this and has been in the business for over two decades. You can get a slice for just $3.50 (tax included) and it's a generous serving. Don't read too much into the man's apparent grumpiness. He's actually quite friendly, even if he doesn't say much."}
{"text":"Maybe it had something to do with the fact that it was 1am and I'd had a few beers, but this place serves up some of the most delicious slice pizza in Toronto. It is run by a Vietnamese couple who are handle the massive amounts of foot traffic through here with diplomacy and poise. Also given the fact that a lot of said foot traffic takes place in the hours right after midnight, it makes it that much more impressive. 

The slices are thin crust with a light amount of cheese. Although I enjoy a cheese heavy pizza, when it's on thin crust it's better to go with less as they have here. The sauce is very tasty and the cheese slice is kind of marguerita style without the basil leafs. But the finishing touch and what takes it from normal to what people are talking about is this garlic and herb oil they have to paint over the slice. My cousin told me about this as I would have otherwise probably just ignored it, but it takes the slice from great to 'I have lost the power of speech' in a very short amount of time. It's just phenomenal. The pepperoni slice is also good, but I'd say the nod goes to the cheese slice. 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Ordered Veal Parmigiana and it was awesome. Sauce was flavourful and delish and probably the best restaurant meat sauce I have had. The veal was nicely breaded with gooey Parmesan on top and the pasta was Linguine which is my favourite, cooked al dente and the sauce nicely coated it.
Best of all everything smelled freshly cooked and it arrived very hot indeed (no smell of used Olive oil lingering). Add some chili  powder and it just set everything off perfectly.
Great work guys."}
{"text":"Omg this pizza place is a great indulgence for a night of drinking. It sorta reminds me of the recently shut down Big Slice. They're slices are large. I ordered the Margarita and THAT homemade garlic oil is on point. Brush that on your pizza!"}
{"text":"Via Brotherhood of the Calzone Newsgroup

Grand Master Bloatini's secret pasta-wich formula: Step 1: Buy one slice of your choice; Step 2: Purchase one of Fresca's signature pasta creations (rotini or penne work best); Step 3: Apply BBQ sauce and additional toppings extremely liberally; Step 4) Distribute an inch-wide ribbon of pasta along the middle of pizza slice; Step 5: Fold sides of slice inward; and, finally, Step 6: Consume rapidly, in silence, with sincere reverence and an XXL bib."}
{"text":"I was with some friends one evening and they were shocked that I'd never been here, so of course we had to go. Wow. I've been back probably five times since and the hype is lived up to here. Dirt cheap, delicious, flat-crust pizza. You definitely don't come for the ambience or the service, you come because you're hungry and you want good pizza for cheap. Two large pizzas for $24? Don't mind if I do! The garlic oil is, as others have noted, the best bit. This, for me, is the perfect pizza: a blend between healthy, classy, simple flat-crust pizza, but with just the right amount of cheap pizza store ambience and oil/grease/garlic. Mmm. Large margarita pizza please!"}
{"text":"I ordered through Just Eats because i wanted a margherita pizza.  The mozzarella wasn't fresh, but the pizza was fairly tasty.  The biggest problem was I ordered a Diet Coke.   They delivered Diet Pepsi.  That is not an okay substitution. :/"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery 2x now.  Definitely love their pizza with thin crust especially their margarita!! Lasagna and pasta is good too not as good as the pizza."}
{"text":"They are a sweet hardworking family and they have great pizza at an affordable / cheap price . One of the best slices in the city"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town period, get the Margherita and shaddup, unless you're a vampire since they garlic and re-garlic the thing.  You've been warned!

Everyone I've taken here (and that's a lot of people) love it, many agree it's the best in Toronto.

Their sandwiches are also very good.  Owners are very nice people, place has only improved since the Massimo brothers re-located."}
{"text":"Review update, bc I just stopped in for a slice at the location instead of ordering. This pizza is definitely among the best I've had in Toronto, if not the best, especially coming from such an unassuming place. The crust is crisp without being hard, a quality hard to find w thin crust, the slices are huge, and the sauce is super flavourful and just the right amount. It was exactly what I was craving, and I feel like maybe walking in gives you a better experience than ordering (although that's still good). We had the pepperoni and the margherita. Both were super fresh and soooo tasty. We had a hard time not burning our mouths on the slices bc they were too good to wait on. 

Service wasn't like, ecstatically friendly, but fast and efficient. It would have to be, bc this place was popping-we sat outside bc there were so many people inside, and watched many people go in and out over the course of the 15 or so minutes we were there. Can't go wrong with this pizza, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Grab a slice of their famous thin slice Margherita Fresca Pizza and slather on their garlic-parsley oil - that stuff is like crack. Granted, I've never had crack but can imagine it's as addictive as this pizza. It's $3.50 a slice. The owners have mastered the art of pizza making and hopefully you'll be lucky enough to grab it when it's fresh out of the oven!"}
{"text":"You're A-OK for Toronto. Hello, cornmeal. Goodbye, attempt to find a proper NY slice in this new hometown of mine. My pizza princess and I have scoured this city for a properly cornmeal'd, crusted, foldable, pepperoni slice in this city, and we went so far as to try a run down, dive-y (in a good way) place like this. Serviceable, quick delivery, cheap ($15 / large pep pie), and up to snuff for anything but New York. 

If I could ask one person over for a Sunday dinner, and pay their cab fare, it'd be The Pizza Rat. Megabus has free wi-fi, Mr. PR!"}
{"text":"I've heard from multiple sources that this place has great pizza. I'd love to tell you if I agree/disagree, but I can't because when I strolled in here at 9:30pm on a Sunday night, I found myself standing at the counter waiting to be served. The two workers were in sight, and even made eye contact, but they decided to keep doing what they were doing instead of turning their attention to me. A minute later, I was told that they were closed.

But wait, it was only 9:30pm, and when I had looked the place up on Google it said they were open till midnight. I pointed this out but I was told nope, they were closing. I asked if it was just today or every Sunday, and I was told they close at 10pm every Sunday. But it was 9:30pm...

On the way out, I noticed their posted hours just outside the door said they closed at midnight too, but I didn't bother. Oh, and so does Zomato and their very own website."}
{"text":"I drove here from far away because of the review. I was expecting something good. First off... The place is so cold... Same as the service! I didn't know it was like pick up kinda thing. The person making the pizza was super rude and not very clean (he made the pizza and receiving money). They didn't have wings. 

The pizza was tasty. Better than average. The basil was great with the pizza. But definitely not worthy of driving all the way hear and not worthy of such high reviews!!!"}
{"text":"My go to pizza joint for take out. Bitondos is the Lebron James of the slice here in Toronto - but for take out I have to say Fresca is the Don."}
{"text":"After all the great reviews I decided to finally track this place down and order some pizza!  We did a pick-up for two pizzas. Overall was good but nothing great. The Margherita was definitely a better choice but suffered from a 'wet bottom' / soggy in the centre of the pizza. The custom order was good but the toppings tasted and bit 'raw' (eg mushrooms, onion) as if the pizza hadn't been baked long enough. Two women were there not sure if that's who baked the pizza. 

Perfectly fine but won't be my go to place. 

Ready in 20 min, cheap ($30 for two large), and good garlic oil."}
{"text":"The service on entry didn't seem too friendly and almost cold but it was something that really didn't phase me. I walked upto the front placed my order and waited for what seemed quick for a large pizza. Got a discount from the cashier who was very pleasant. Bit into it and had literally had an hallelujah moment, of what was possibly the best za I've ever had in this city. Definitely will go there again and try the calzos! Thanks Fresca"}
{"text":"Great food , amazing prices, great hard working people, friendly  Love their pizza.

{"text":"I'm sorry, did I just take a bite before a picture? Omg yes. This place is amazing. Thin and crunchy crust; perfect sauce to herbs ratio; tasty and warm cheese; pepperoni slices to top it all off...one word: PERFECTION. I don't think I've had a bite of such tasty goodness in so long. My friends, above all, this slice cost me $3.75. Yes, I want to cry tears of joy. 

Trust me. When you see the man tossing the pizza dough from the outside window, you will know that this pizzeria is in it for the long haul. There is little indoor seating though, so hopefully you are coming to taste this pizza on a good day. There are some picnic tables on the outside of the place for you to sit.

I heard that there's also a spicy oil that you can add to enhance the flavour. So keep posted for the updated review!"}
{"text":"Excellent for what it is - a no frills neighborhood pizza joint for a quick hot slice. They don't pretend to be anything more than what they are. So the low ratings due to decor or service are extreme.
Came here after having ramen nearby at Ramen Isshin. Still had an appetite so dropped for a pepperoni slice. It was piping hot and a generous portion for $3.75.
Would visit the area just for a slice."}
{"text":"Service here sucks in that they often get bogged down with orders and serve people out of turn. But this is a contender for best Pizza in Toronto. I come from Philly and I know my Pizza.  Ingredients here are top notch quality ...but not exotic, healthy, or  gourmet by any means...which is an important distinction for making east coast style pizza in my mind .  

Hawaiian was out of this world and the pepperoni was good too. Prices are wicked cheap !"}
{"text":"Wish I could give it zero stars this place is a nightmare super filthy would not recommend eating here"}
{"text":"Dirty place lazy employees if ur looking for a full pizza you'll be in for a long wait 15 mi s for them means them talkin for 15 mins then get started on your order"}
{"text":"I can't say enough regarding how amazing the food is here. I'm a regular customer now, religiously picking up a margarita slice once every two or three weeks.  Occasionally my husband and I will order their calzone too. We're obsessed with the garlic they use - can't get enough of it.  To top it off, the people that run the place are super nice."}
{"text":"Came here at precisely 11:06am since I was waiting for them to open. I went in and the owner said that it will be around 10 more minutes for the pizza to be done so I waited in the meantime. This corner store holds around 5 tables (I'd say 15 people?). I ordered the margarita slice right when he was done making the pizza. For $3.50 per slice, this is a great price!! Overall, I enjoyed the slice and liked the garlic oil they put on it. This place is really good for eating in and out as these slices are super thin but can hold the toppings well. I will for sure come back and try their other slices."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place, probably the best pizza in the area for the price. I ordered delivery one Thursday night and waited an hour for delivery. I called and they apologized for forgetting my order and had it there in 10 minutes with a 50% discount. So I forgave them :p 

Otherwise delivery has been speedy and hot."}
{"text":"This has to be one of Toronto's hidden gems for pizza.

Located just west of Spadina, it's on the strip of College that connects Little Italy, Kensington, and The (south) Annex, so competition is pretty steep.

As previous reviews said, the margherita is the way to go. Tonight I had one fresh from the oven. Basil, cheese, tomato sauce, and a house-made garlic oil spread, all on a thin crust- awesome. It's a big slice, and has to be eaten al libretto. Add a Brio chinotto for an even better experience. It's also $3.50 with taxes in. The owners are also very friendly and quick.

I feel that (Vinny) Massimo's has gone downhill as of late too, so Fresca is the way to go for one of the best, and cheapest slices around."}
{"text":"You wouldn't give this place a second glance when walking by, but you should. I was ambushed into getting their pizza one night and the rest is history. These slices are crafted just the way I like them - large, thinner crust, and with the option of brushing it down with some garlic/pesto oil. Not to mention the fact it's dirt cheap! My go-to is the Margarita  :)

The nice thing is that it's open when all the other joints decide to call it a night (but sometimes they decide they don't feel like being open and close earlier). It's a hole in the wall and great for grabbing a bite with some friends. There isn't too much seating but most people get their order to go or finish up fast enough. So pull up a chair and enjoy a slice or two... or four."}
{"text":"I didn't expect for a small pizza shop such as this one to have tasted so good. I've had pizzas from really high end and expensive places but none could compare to Fresca.
I walked in and grabbed a slice of their margherita which ran for like $3.50 or something and it was so good to the point where I had to run back and order an entire box.
It is not the traditional tomato sauce, buffalo cheese and basil type of margherita - they have this garlic parsley oil that they brush on top - but it unique and delicious.
They use huge pepperoni slices as well. 
The owners were quiet but very nice. It was really busy as well. 
The pizza is good enough where it requires no additional dipping sauces or anything on top for that matter.
They also sell salads, pastas and calzones. The only downfall is that they do not sell chicken wings. 
This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Came here on a cold night after one of my final exams as an undergrad due to previous Yelper reviews. I got a slice of the pizza margherita and literally could not stop drooling for the next bite. Their garlic oil is out of this world and the chili sauce was superb! I loved it so much I got a slice to go as well. 

The owners are a sweet Vietnamese couple who (after realizing I spoke Vietnamese) stopped and had a conversation with me. This was right before his wife sped out to a delivery. 

Definitely recommend this pizza as a great alternative to the yucky chain stores if not just for quantity but the quality factor is there as well. Reason for not receiving 5 stars is because I've only tried their margherita. Will update when I try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"From the comfort of our couch, my buddy and I were after a New York style slice. Toronto has dominated beautiful personal pizzas with fresh ingredients reminiscent of Venice, but for some reason hasn't mastered the art of the cheap slice. I'm not sure if Fresca is what we were after totally, but it was thin, bendable and greasy. They delivered hot, cheap pizza within 30 minutes of ordering. I'll try it again, but I'm not a convert."}
{"text":"my friend who doesn't have yelp RELIGIOUSLY comes here on a weekly basis and kept telling me I had to check it out, I came here before a concert that was across the street (notice a pattern yet) and I was completely blown away. this place may look like nothing on the outside (no offence intended) but on the inside is what I would describe as a flavor palace. came here and ordered some panzorotti's as that is my go to when it comes to something pizza related. the food that came to the table was absolutely fantastic, and I absolutely love the olive oil station as well, kinda of a bit of a \"double dipping\" situation but it brought a certain richness to the food that was unparalleled in previous food experiences, 
street parking is available but often times is seriously crowded, and the transit options are the 506 college street, and the 510 spadina with a bit of a walk. 
the service is great, friendly and welcoming. the hours that they are open are also amazing. 

would go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best pizza spots in the City. About $3 (and change) for a slice, plus you can brush the oil + basil (not sure what kind of oil it is) unto your slice. 

Fair price for a plain or pepperoni slice (BTW, anyone who says \"cheese slice\" is not a pizza aficiando)

Pies are actually around just $15 CDN (for the standard large 2-3 topping).

Cafe Diplomatico, Bitondos, Whole Foods (Yorkville location only) and here (Fresca) are the best options for the top bang-for-buck pizza joints."}
