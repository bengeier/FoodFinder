{"text":"Great restaurant, they have all you can eat buffet, quality and service is excellent one of my favorite restaurants in"}
{"text":"For $13 you get a decent lunch bento box, I got the tofu one that came with tempura, veggie spring rolls, rice, a california roll and soup & salad to start. It's filling and worth what you pay, IMO  You can order a la carte or do their AYCE option here as well, which I think would probably work better for dinner than lunch"}
{"text":"We are in Calgary on vacation and stopped in for lunch because it was just about the only thing open in downtown on  Saturday afternoon. We decided to have the all-you-can-eat lunch. The waitress was amazingly attentive and really took time to help out our friend with gluten sensitivities. If you're in downtown Calgary, try this place out!"}
{"text":"The first time I came here with my family they were quite busy so we were just ignored by the door, so after a while of being not helped, we just left. Recently I came here to have sushi for a friends birthday. We ordered a sushi boat and a sushi roll boat. The sushi and rolls were okay, nothing special at all. However, in our rolls we found multiple large pieces of plastic inside them. The staff told us that they forgot to remove the plastic from the sushi and  and only after our requests, offered a minuscule amount off our meal. The plastic in the sushi could've been a huge choking hazard if it were to be eaten by children. Overall, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Having been to other fusion locations, I think this location is the better one. We had dinner buffet on a Sunday. The place was not completely packed so I guess that's partially why the staff were attentive and efficient.   The chicken wings were good, the sashimi were very fresh and good quality, the tempura was fresh, and the salmon avocado roll was amazing (large roll with very little rice and lots of salmon and avocado). They also played up the plating decoration.  Our orders came out immediately after we placed them on the iPad on our table. Was very pleased with the efficiency. The interior is modern, clean and well kept. Offers table seating, bar seating and booths.  Obviously you can't compare an all you can eat buffet to a high end contemporary Japanese restaurant for creativity. For an all you can eat Japanese restaurant, this place is very good and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Another cool spot to check out. I love sushi so every chance I get, I try a new place and always up for chefs special on the rolls. I would give this place a shot. Wonderful staff as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a few times since our favourite sushi place shut down for renos (and then never reopened). Generally, service is quick and friendly, food is good for the price. Tonight is a different story.   We were one of four tables yet the servers never took away our empty dishes, only stacked new dishes on top and said they would take the empties later. No one stopped to ask how everything was which meant our water glasses sat empty until we had placed both on the edge of the table where every staff member repeatedly walks by. Two of our dishes were just never delivered which can happen, but when it is dead I don't see why it would.  The price was increased to $27.95/person because of the holiday but I feel like the service is lacking for that price point. My husband ordered oysters with our first order but they didn't come until we had finished our second order and were getting ready to leave. The topping was burnt which made it really unpleasant. Many of the hot dishes were delivered cold.  Long story short, I'm not impressed with the restaurant tonight. Typically things are good or at least okay but tonight was lacking."}
{"text":"I never got to even try the place stood in line by myself at the door for nearly 20 minutes before a hostess who was trying to clean tables and deliver food finally told me oh I'll be back with you in a moment. After another 10 minutes of running around she never came back so they obviously are woefully understaffed. Very disappointed because it seemed like it had good reviews but a simple it's going to be a 30 or 40 minute wait would have sufficed and I would have tried some other time."}
{"text":"Please forces on hygiene! This place I Have been to many times, I remember the service and food hygiene was good before, but today was so bad. The table didn't been cleaned completely, there were some oil spots on the surface. And then we found some residue of food in my friend's plate, the worst thing was we found hair in the beef sashimi. However, the waiter never said sorry, they just changed the food and plate . If you cannot maintain the hygiene, you will loss your customers."}
{"text":"The restaurant was so awesome - I went there for the all you can buffet on Tuesday, January 12, and my friend and I loved the fantastic food. The rice was perfectly cooked and the sushi and sashimi was fresh and immaculately made. I am definitely returning there and looking forward to more of the fantastic cusine at Fusion!"}
{"text":"Loved the food despite of how small were the rolls! *sad face*. The service was ok. The place is very nice, I went there for lunch with my mom and we ordered from the menu, we ate until we were full and paid the same as the all you can eat service for only 1. Moral of the story: the all you can eat is a little pricey imo."}
{"text":"Best fusion in calgary hands down. This restraunt will be the death of me. The walk from the table to the car is the hardest part of the night."}
{"text":"Since I'm craving for sushi, all you can eat will be a good deal.  Read reviews and give Fusion Sushi a try.  Since we woke up very late by the time I get to the restaurant is already 3:30.  The waitress said it will be dinner price and I have no problem with it. 27.99 each for party of 3.   Talk about food...very disappointed.  All foods are blanded.  No taste at all. Will never go again."}
{"text":"The vegetable sushi party tray is a great deal! For only $25 you get 40 rolls. We ordered delivery and were impressed with the presentation and assortment of flavours. Some were spicy, some had tempura veggies and some had a sweet mango sauce. My boyfriend and I were impressed. I can't speak for the fish, but this will be my new go-to for veggie rolls!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for AYCE Sushi on a weekday.  There is a good selection of food in each category, such as appetizers, sushi, sashimi, rolls, etc., which is very similar to other Fusion locations.  I like how it has takoyaki (octopus balls) on the menu, which is not offered at most Fusion locations.  Salmon sashimi was fresh.  I also ordered tuna sashimi but it was tasteless, same for the grilled beef short ribs.  The rolls are not bad but they have more rice than how I like them.  As for dessert, my favourite was the mango pudding, which was very soft with lots of mango favour.  Overall, I think this Fusion location is worth a try if you are in downtown but I do like the Ranchlands location more."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner buffet, service were great, food were fresh... lots of varies to choose from, from sushi, sashimi to thai food as well. Fancy decor... nice quiet place to enjoy food!"}
{"text":"I'll just start by saying, you will NOT be disappointed with this Sushi place. I came down to Calgary to spend a couple nights here with my girlfriend and enjoy the city.  We're from Edmonton and we usually go to Watari for their amazing all you can eat sushi when we are back home. At first, we were skeptical about trying a place here since our standards were so high from watari - but let me tell you, to our surprise, this place blew watari out of the waters!! The quality of the food was absolutely incredible. Every dish we got was to die for. They also have all you can eat Thai here as an add on, which was absolutely fantastic. Their Pad Thai and Coconut shrimp  from that selection was a savory mouth watering joy!. Their Gyoza ( they just call them dumplings here ) were fantastic aswell!  And that was just the food. Now let's start on the Service. We had a young lady named Bella who served us. She was fantastic ( So if you guys get her, make sure you tip her well!!) She was super friendly,  explained everything carefully, and helped us learn how to use their new IPad ordering. She was quite adorable aswell ( my girlfriends going to kill me for saying that, but for some people this is important ). The best moment i experienced with her was when my girlfriend took literally one sip of water and bella ran over to fill it up 1 cm it went with more water! It was very sweet of her. This is one place I don't mind tipping big at. Great food great price and great service. What more do you need??So stop looking for Sushi reviews and places and get your ass here!"}
{"text":"The food here was decent. The sashimi was fresh, especially salmon and snapper. The cooked dishes surprised me. Chicken satay was tender and tasty. Salmon belly was crispy. Service was fairly good.   The only thing I would complain is that there was too much rice in the rolls and sushi. If you don't want to get stuffed that quickly, don't order too much sushi.   In general, everything was good."}
{"text":"Really small sushi pieces, rather tasteless, expensive.  Did not include wasabi or ginger in takeout order (or soy sauce even).  Calgary is not really a sushi town - but there are much better places than this for sure."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by our hotel concierge as it was in very close proximity to our hotel. Upon arrival, we were greeted by friendly staff eager to get our order going. We decided to try AYCE - since it literally included everything on the menu. Doing so allowed us to try the following: pad thai, pizza roll, calamari, chicken wings, coconut shrimp, lomen soup, mango chicken, BBQ beef, tuna roll, edamame, fried rice and dessert- mango and green tea ice cream flavors."}
