{"text":"For a soft opening, this place was fantastic. I got the Tuscan pizza with bruschetta tomatoes and spinach. The crust was thin, got it fresh out of the oven, perfect size for one. Great iced tea choices too (kind of random, but true). 

The concept is a build your own pizza bar, but they also have specialty ones and salads. There is a nice looking bar too, but this is lunch and I'm not on Mad Men. Overall great experience... I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Straight to the point...Revo is an unorganized restaurant. Went to Revo ' s for lunch at 12 pm and the kitchen didn't have enough ingredients for their Mediterranean pizza toppings. The place was fully staffed and the service was slow. The food, I wish I could say that the food was worth the slow service and unorganized waiters but that would be false. The pizza they serve is burnt and the presentation is sloppy. This place has potential but the waiters and pizza cook need to be further trained."}
{"text":"You can't find a tastier pizza than this anywhere in Tempe... Believe me I've tried them all. The service & the location is perfect for if you're on the go or have extra time to hang out & relax. 
The only problem that I had when it's busy is parking, but if you live in the area its a beautiful walk & they deliver!"}
{"text":"I was riding the Light Rail home from work this evening and decided to check this place out.  I had previously noticed it last week but didn't have time to stop in at that time.  You definitely can't get any more convenient than on the the Tempe Transit Center grounds.

I'm not going to go in to what kind of pizza I had and all of that.   I'll leave that for the food snobs that like to do that kind of stuff.   I'll simply state that the pizza was excellent and they had a pretty decent bar selection. 

The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that this place is a \"hipster\" joint which generally drives me insane.   If you don't mind that kind of environment or if you want to order something to go I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Revo Pizzabar has an original taste from their specialty pizzas to their outstanding pastas, salads, and new sandwiches made with pizza dough. It's in a great location and the staff is both welcoming and friendly. I always have a great experience at Revo.

What I love most about the restaurant is the mix of services it offers. The baristas make very good coffee, the bartenders make a variety of delicious drinks, and the cooks make awesome food"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever tasted! Great atmosphere! The service was very friendly. 
I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was amazing.  Perfect day for the large glass doors to be open.  Food was great, hot and with some very unique options.  Staff was helpful, friendly and fun to hang out with.  Will definitely be back in soon."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and salad 1 1/2 hrs before needing the pizza delivered. Asked to be delivered at 3:50 pm.  4:05 received a call letting us know they were running behind and the pizzas were in the oven and we'd have them in 10 mins. I called them  20 min later and asked where pizza was. And the response was they are out for delivery. In their defense mill ave was blocked off but that doesn't have anything to do with the pizzas in the oven at 15 min after the time we requested them.  Certainly the pizza being ordered as far in advance as we did would have enough time to cook and deliver on time.
I would recommend not using their delivery."}
{"text":"The place is outstanding!!  I stopped here with a friend from out of town and my two kids.  We all ordered something different - pizza, mac n cheese, meatball sub and a roast beef sandwich.  Everything was delicious - so much so, that we ended up sharing our meals.  There were multiple mac n cheese options, so my 5 year old ordered \"normal mac n cheese.\"   We all loved it.  The sandwiches were made with the same dough used for the pizza crust, which was amazing!  The pizza was among the best we have had in the valley (better than my two favorites: Oreganos and Spinatos)!!  My 7 year old enjoyed ordering his own personal pizza - you choose the crust, sauce, cheese and then any of other toppings you want.  It was a fun place to eat and excellent service."}
{"text":"They have a big sign in front of the location near the Tempe commuter center advertising their great breakfast.   They took my interest with that so I gave it a try.   I had the impression that I was the first person to ever come in for breakfast!   The bartender didn't know about breakfast and asked me to talk to the gentleman at the coffee bar.   He fumbled around for a while looking for the breakfast menu, and first showed me a lunch menu which was a sloppy hand-written page covered in grease and grime.   Then he finally found the breakfast menu, also a nasty little printed sheet with a lot of kitchen grime on it.   I looked at the \"menu\" for as long as I could stand it, and ordered a skillet with coffee.   The coffee arrived fairly quickly, and tasted like Maxwell House.   The skillet arrived eventually, and by itself would be a two star item.   The dining room is comfortable enough with really neat tables chairs and booths, but the atmosphere is ruined by the music which is a free Pandora stream playing good music punctuated by annoying, blaring commercials.   Hey, restaurant owner: you can't afford to subscribe to a streaming radio station?   This restaurant is in a location that enjoys foot traffic from downtown business and municipal employees, university students, and tourists.   It looks like a good concept and should be executed much better.   Revo Pizzabar is not seizing the opportunity and is not quite delivering what their signs promise.   Overall, two stars for the food, zero for the coffee, and one star for the review.   My recommendation is to pass, and the search continues for a downtown Tempe breakfast stop."}
{"text":"I went into Revo on recommendation from my hotel upon arriving in Tempe. It did not disappoint! The GM was behind the bar and was extremely welcoming and friendly. She made suggestions on what to order and also let me know of other promotions and specials happening later on in my stay. 

I made my own pizza - pepperoni and roasted pepper on wheat crust. The crust was thin and tasty but could've been a little crispier. The toppings tasted very fresh. The portion was perfect for 1 person with a little to take back to the hotel with me.

The restaurant was clean and had a really good vibe. I felt very comfortable and enjoyed the ambience. 

Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Nice place near ASU. Great pizza, full bar. Fast and friendly service. The only drawback is that they don't have desserts."}
{"text":"I was at my friend's apartment and literally nothing soundsed good except pizza. Turns out there is not a single Pizza Hut location in Tempe that has gluten free capabilities, Domino's is not an option for celiacs like me, and Barro's is just a little bit out of my price range tonight.

Enter Revo Pizzabar. I thought, \"Hey they have gluten free pizza, but I wonder what their policy is in terms of the shared pizza oven and keeping it safe for people like me...\" I called the place and the nicest girl named Melissa answered the phone, and while initially confused by what I meant by \"gluten free policies\", she was more than happy to let the kitchen know that for safety reasons I would need my pizza baked on a sheet of parchment paper to protect it from the possible cross contamination in the oven. 

I really appreciated that Melissa was understanding of my dietary restrictions and that she was happy to make it happen for me. It is one of the many reasons why I will definitely be returning to Revo again and again.

I got my pizza within 10 minutes (I walked over and picked it up); it was hot and it smelled like heaven in a box. One of the big issues with gluten free pizza is that sometimes the edges get burnt and the rest of the crust is at best underdone. Not the case with my order tonight; the bottom was crispy and the edges were nicely toasted. They use these big slices of fresh deli pepperoni, so you can bite through them and all of your toppings don't come off with the first bite. 

When I walked in to pick up my order, I really liked the new-rustic decor of the place. They also have a full bar and huge tvs for you sports fans.

Pricing wise, those of us who eat gluten free know we are often subject to inflated pricing for any number of reasons. Not at Revo; here you get your gluten free pizza for the same price as regular crust! My pepperoni and mushroom pizza came out to $9.19 with tax. You build your own pizza starting at $6.50 and the price goes up with your topping choices. The pricing was another factor that influenced my choice to try Revo; it's really nice not to feel gouged for having a serious illness. 

Part of the reason Revo is often uncrowded is the location- being on the northeastern spur of the Mill Ave district means less foot traffic. However, they do offer free parking in the City Hall garage across the street, and that definitely makes it worth a try. They opened in fall of 2014, and have been trying to build the following that they so greatly deserve.

I really enjoyed my experience with takeout from Revo tonight, and I will definitely be returning to take advantage of happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is closed. They could have made good money selling coffee, but they were too greedy. This is the result."}
{"text":"I run a 25+ bike ride. i stopped in a few times before to confirm our arrival on a tuesday. Honestly, i thought this place may be a bit too stuffy for our band of dirt balls and miscreants, but boy was i wrong. 

They put aside an entire booth section for us, Took care of us with a happy hour special, My pizza came out when we were getting our checks....FREE PIZZA. They took it off without me even having to ask. Thats customer service. 

Oh yeah and the pizza. HOLY F**** its good. i got the Carvinorium...or something. its their all meat pizza. Im from NY so you know I'm gonna be picky. This pizza..id give it a 9/10. I was completely floored by the quality, balance of crust to toppings...the grease.....ohhhh the grease. 

All in all, we descended upon them with 25 pizza and beer hungry monsters and NO it wasn't perfect, but they took care of us. Good customer service has nothing to do with everything being in place, its about how you handle errors and your attention to detail. Props to Revo."}
{"text":"Too bad this place has closed...it was conveniently located right off the light rail and the menu was great for a quick lunch or dinner.  The staff was super friendly too, but I guess I should have known it wouldn't make it when the restaurant was super quiet while school was in session and the weather was nice outside."}
{"text":"I ordered the truffle mac n cheese and it was really good. my mac n cheese cravings were finally satisfied! I also went during happy hour and my waiter was kind of enough to make me a drink that she said was her favorite since I asked her which of the drinks she would recommend. She said it was similar to sex on the beach but she added mango juice and something else, which I forgot."}
{"text":"For food, price, location, and decor I would have given this place at least 4 stars. I went here once close to when it first opened. I love that it's just steps from the light rail and an easy walk to Mill Ave. It's create your own pizza or mac & cheese (super awesome), and it's cheaper than other similar restaurants, and just as good. I also love the large windows and exposed brick walls...but what I don't love is the service. 

The first time I went I didn't notice that the service was slow nearly as much. I did think that it was weird the place was nearly empty and yet service wasn't quick, but I liked everything else so much that I had decided this was going to be my go to neighborhood pizza place. 

I went back again tonight. The place was about half full. It took about 5-10 minutes before anyone came over to us after we were told to seat ourselves. The waitress wasn't particularly friendly, she just handed us some menus and asked if we wanted anything to drink besides water. We told her water was fine. We then were there at least another 10 minutes and nothing. We never got our waters, we never got to place our order, and no staff came over at any time. We walked out and walked to one of the many other pizza places nearby (NYPD pizza, it was delicious with excellent service). There are just too many good restaurants within an easy walking distance to ignore the customers as we were treated. 

Maybe I will give this place another shot, but I will have a backup plan for when we are ignored for 15-20 minutes. My favorite restaurant in Tempe is a two minute walk away (Postino Annex), and that will always tempt me more (and they have great service)."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot for you Mill Avenuers!  Found the Revo Pizzabar during one of our walks so we stopped in to check out the menu and looked around.  The manager came to greet us and told her we work in the area and always looking for a lunch spot and happy hour for our work group.  She immediately handed us a card with coupon discount.  The card include their daily specials etc.  So a week later we came back for lunch (6 of us) the service was awesome, the menu looked great, pizza, sandwiches & salads.

Pizza's were great size for one person, someone else order The Maverick and it was huge!  Great looking sandwich, 2 people could split it.  The manager stopped and she remembered us and thank us for bringing our lunch group in.  We were all very happy with our orders.  Except...the Kale salad w/tangerines.  Although it looked fabulous the taste was bland.  The house dressing didn't accommodate the salad...it needed a little something more.  Other than the salad everything else was delicious.

Again, the lunch service was awesome...we were all in and out within 60 mins. 

I'll keep you posted when we bring our work group back for happy hour...stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Food was OK, had the pizza, caprese salad, friends had a few different sandwiches. Not worth it. Service was terrible."}
{"text":"So walking in it was a little confusing if this was a order first type place or a sit down restaurant with someone waiting on you. We were the o my ones in the restaurant so that's not a good sign, but this place is right next to ASU and school is out. The menu was pretty basic and nothing really stood out to me but i ordered the REVO pizza. I do have to say I like way this place looks. It's very urban with giant glass windows and a great center bar with four flat screen TVs. 

The pizza was good but wasn't amazing and the Caesar salad was very basic. I wouldn't mind go back and giving it one more try for dinner but I will be trying something else."}
{"text":"We found this place while we were looking for a late, inexpensive dinner, and it was just what we were hoping for. The pizza was great, and the service was friendly. The only minor complaint is that the build your own pizza was a little misleading. Although they're listed as steps toward building your pizza, they charge extra for toppings and different cheese. Nonetheless, even with the extra $2 for my topping and cheese, the entire thing came out to $8. It was high quality and delicious--for which most other restaurants would probably charge at least $12. They were out of the build your own mac and cheese, which I'm excited to try next time."}
{"text":"You know how you can end up being unexpectedly delighted by the quality of a place? 
Well, that is what is was for me in my visit to Revo Pizza Bar - good location, right by the main rail station - charming decor, and the food is served quickly and is delicious.

You order up front, right by where the pizzas and food are made so you see the food being made and they have this beautiful pizza oven that cooks the pizzas in a flash. The chef makes the mozzarella in house and besides pepperoni they also have a dry hot sausage, called Salame Calabrese (or just Calabrese) they use on the pizzas, that is mind blowingly good.

They also have a nice selection of cocktails and local beers, and I assume wine (give me some suds over pressed grapes any day folks). I had the Carnivora (meat pizza) with the Calabrese - wonderfully thin and done quickly. My only thing, crust was a bit soft - I'll probably ask them to keep the pizza in a bit longer to hopefully crisp up that crust but overall the pizza was delicious. Another friend had the 4 cheese pasta with truffle oil and it was also amazing and we had a cheese plate which was also surprisingly good with a selection of quality cheeses, including the house made Mozzarella, walnuts, olives, and some toasted bread slices. All at what I consider extremely reasonable prices. 

I'm a little concerned that people don't get that a restaurant in the transportation center can be this good and may not try it out so folks, give it a shot - I think we all want to see a place that does food this well, and is as supportive of local products as these folks, thrive. I know I look forward to coming back and trying more of the menu, including what looks like some wonderfully fresh salads."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this place after coming back from the football game with my family; it was one of the few restaurants we could find that would let people in under 21 at night (at least until 11pm). 

We ended up sitting on the small patio at elevated tables and had a perfect view of the large TVs above the bar through the glass pane windows. We ended up ordering from their decent selection of beer while munching on a few different appetizer plates. The appetizers were good, albeit a little smaller than I had hoped for. We snacked on some cheese and salami plates before getting two pizzas to split between the four of us. The food was good and the ingredients seemed very fresh. Nearly a dozen options for pizza with the ability to build your own and, for somewhere that seemed to be aimed at a trendy crowd, the list of ingredients you could choose from was more than I would've imagined. 

The service was quick, especially for a new staff that was busy on game day. My parents were fans, so I was inclined to agree with them. I'll have to come back with friends to try some more of their options."}
{"text":"Revo is right off the light rail stop and looks pretty promising.  I came with a group of 6 for lunch. I ordered The Maverick - ham, pepperoni, salami, provolone and honey mustard. The \"pizza bread\" they server it on was delicious. It also came with a side salad which was a generous portion. You can build your own pizza and your own macaroni and cheese with any of the toppings they put on the pizza. I really enjoyed my lunch and took half of the sandwich home for the next day. 

I don't know what the issue is with the salads but I have heard from several people they are not good. Too few topping or just really plain? Not sure but the Sammy was delicious. I'll be back."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. The food was absolutely terrible. I got one slice in and decided I'd have to go somewhere else for dinner. When I told the waitress, she asked the manager what could be done and gave us a small discount. I was not about to pay for two uneaten pizzas. I asked to speak to the manager myself and I am absolutely appalled at how I was treated.  She told me that she would not comp my pizza because we had eaten some of the food, to which I replied that of course we had to try the food to know that it was bad. She said that if we had eaten the majority of our food then we would have to pay for it. I about lost my mind at this comment. There was one slice missing from the pizza. A single slice was gone from a six-slice pizza and she referred to it as the \"majority.\" When I finally made it clear that we should not and would not pay for such bad food and service, she rolled her eyes and scoffed \"ok\" at me and quickly walked away. This is without a doubt the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I will never be returning and I highly encourage that none of you try this restaurant. La Bocca and Mellow Mushroom are both pizzas places just a few blocks away and are superior in every sense of the word."}
{"text":"Great food and cool atmosphere! Super hip and trend. Today was my first time and I will most definitely be back! I got the Revo pizza (arugula, prosciutto, figs, goat cheese and truffle oil) so delicious! Very friendly staff. This is a great place for hanging out and chatting with friends over food and drinks. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Short list:
Great location
Great design and environment  
Attentive staff and manager
Poor food

Let me say the people are great! The staff really care for their patrons and it is greatly appreciated. 

Unfortunately the food is not up to par as the location and design. Coming here for a quick beer and getaway, I order the pizza bites as a way sample their dough. 4 pizza pockets for $6 dollars seems reasonable but as I ate, I found that it was unfortunately not worth the money. The bottoms are soggy and the chef even had the gall to place a pizza pocket that was hallow. I understand that the chef is new, but that is unacceptable. I mean, I hate to say this, but hot pocket does a better job than this sad Appetizer. I want this place to do well, but please take pride in your food and never send out something that is short of a standard you want it to be."}
{"text":"Great bar/restaurant!  Open feel and some outdoor seating. Quick friendly service.  Excellent food. Great location."}
{"text":"Great new local spot! Perfect place to watch your favorite sports team (Cardinals & Devils) and they play the volume! Nice large screens & you are steps away from Sun Devil stadium. Patio is dog friendly but very dark at night so best to experience the patio before it gets too dark. The staff is friendly enough but lacking the energy and friendliness of some of the other local bars. We've been several times and notice the bar staff is lacking good eye contact and this may be due to lack of experience. Staff development and engagement is a big opportunity for them."}
