{"text":"On a drive through the Junction looking for dinner, we saw the Troubadour and decided to try it.  It was great.  Great atmosphere, people of all ages.  The food was delicious.  I had a great grilled cheese sandwich and my boyfriend had the burger.  The music was perfect, lots of Beatles.  My only issue was trying to stay on the chair, it was wobbly and high and kept trying to buck me off : )"}
{"text":"The troubadour is absolutely one of the best bars in the city, no televisions, regular great music (that's not overly intrusive) good bar staff and fair prices.  Monday nights are home cooking Mondays, well worth it."}
{"text":"I love the Troubadour!  The drinks are cold, the patio is private and well shaded, and the food is always good.   The menu is a little bit on the small side, but I think that helps to keep things running smoothly and consistently.   The tuna melt is definitely one of the best in town, and so is their guacamole, even though it stays with you all day afterward :)  The staff are generally pretty friendly too, and it all adds up to make it the best bar in the Junction.  Highly recommended."}
