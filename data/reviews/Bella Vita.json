{"text":"We had an amazing dinner at the Bella Vita ristorante at the District . We are from Italy and were delighted when we found an authentic Italian restaurant which is also ran by Italians . The GM Nicola is fantastic he does a great job at giving the place great atmosphere with live music on the patio . So happy we finally found a bit of Italy right here in Henderson . The staff is mostly Italian and the dishes are delicious . We will be going back very soon . Thank you for the great evening . Grazie Rita"}
{"text":"Wow, my wife and I decided to try something off the strip and boy were we glad that we did.  Some of the best Italian food that i've had.  I'm Italian so i know what the best choices are, but my wife is not, and our waiter Ryan was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the flavors of almost everything. He is a young looking man and he recommended us a certain wine which my wife LOVED........and now i have to go buy a bottle of it and its not cheap -_-.  Per our waiters recommendations my wife got Spaghetti Amatriciana and I got my go to Italian dish of Gnocchi Alla Bolognese.  Both were very good and we cleaned our plates.  If you are visiting Las Vegas and want really good Italian food and don't want to pay the inflated strip prices, then you need to go here.  Ask to be sat at Ryans table cause he was one of the best waiters/waitresses that i have had.  Hands down my new favorite place to go when i visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. The patio is lovely. I come here for happy hour often - it's a great place to have an early date night with my boyfriend or hang out with girlfriends. The happy hour pasta arabiatta is great if you like spicy and the flatbread is delicious too. Plus, of course, wine!"}
{"text":"The place is in great location. The food was pretty fine, I would not say it was awesome. The service was terrible. Maybe we just got  a wrong guy to serve us... no checking on drinks, no suggestions on food... Another downside is cost, soups&pizza&salad close to $ 70. Pizzas are very small, the smaller cost would justify the size. I would not say the food had unique flavors. If you are in town for a weekend, find another place to make your weekend pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and super yummy food. I'm glad they accept reservations...no waiting! Grab a table outside when the weather is mild. Live music and a great wine list."}
{"text":"An excellent authentic Italian Restaurant in the District.  The waitress was awesome.  First we ordered the Caesar Salad with anchovies. It was great, not too many places serve with anchovies. The Tagliatelle Bolognese was superb.  It came out at the right temperature and the bread was fantastic.  Loved the outdoor setting.  Can't wait to go back and try some of the $7 happy hour items and listen to the music. This restaurant deserves more than 5 stars.  As I said, can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Dined here tonight. Had moderate expectations, yet it still failed to meet them. The ambience was lovely, the server, Kenny, was fantastic, and the appetizers (octopus, misto) were decent. The entrees, however, were lackluster. Perhaps we ordered the wrong items. I was told the tagliatelle bolognese was the hottest dish, and it happens to be one of my favorite pastas. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. It was rather dry, over cooked,  and needed a pinch more of salt. My father had the pork chop, and he said it wasn't anything special. My sister did think her cabonara was okay. She said the pancetta was salty, but it complimented the pasta. We had a party of six, but the consensus was underwhelmed. Go for the apps, the bartender was great, Kenny was super accommodating, and the location is just right. Perhaps it could use a little tweaking."}
{"text":"Terrible food, terrible service.  The food isn't authentic Italian and tastes like I could have gotten it at a drive thru. There are a thousand better Italian places in Vegas,  don't waste  your money here."}
{"text":"Great place to dine in the District. It's very cute and friendly, the food is excellent, wine menu is limited by the glass so I had to drink a whole bottle. The bar has 2 TVs."}
{"text":"Great food, music and ambience!...definitely coming back here again! Glad to be here!"}
{"text":"So you need a car or transportation.  This is in a shopping area called The District neighboring the Green Valley Ranch hotel, about 12 miles from the Tropicana end of strip.  If you're in the area, give it a try.  The shops were empty.  The only thing busy on a Tuesday night was this restaurant.  On this night it was a bit too busy.  It seems a company decided to have dinner for at least 50 employees who took up a good portion of the place, which is fine, except it made it impossible to talk.  The acoustics were not good.  So loud.  Seems like this wasn't a good mix of regular diners and a company party.  I would have suggested they book the whole place for the evening.  The bread to start was yummy.  The house cabernet delicious, nice and dry.  The margarita pizza was good.  Pasta is house made and delicious.  Sauces good.  Family run.  Decent portion of food.  But a couple of issues that really shouldn't happen here.  The waiter seemed very rushed and that we had arrived before the company employees were seated.  Waiter did his best to check on us but he was always flying by the table.  I felt like if I asked a question it would interrupt him.  He must have had too much to do to serve his customers more attentively.  In part because he was in a hurry he took my order incorrectly.  I usually order chicken picatta, one of my favorite dishes and I've eaten it in many restaurants.  When it arrived it was chewy and looked light brown instead of white. Definitely not the tender chicken that comes with picatta.  But I was hungry and it took quite awhile to get the food so I didn't question it, just figured I'd ordered a dish that wasn't good.  A bit of a disappointment.  When the bill came I noticed it said veal picatta, not chicken picatta.  As it turns out he took down the wrong order.  Normally I would have said something about it tasting bland and not tender but again, he was in a big hurry and I was hungry.  This kind of ruined the rest of the meal because I don't like veal picatta, haven't ordered in years and normally don't eat meat.  I wish I would have had an opportunity to taste the chicken picatta.  When I pointed out the discrepancy on the bill he apologized and took the dinner off the check, which was very nice.  But my stomach felt a bit queasy the rest of the evening.  Honestly all the times I've ordered chicken picatta I've never had a waiter bring me the wrong thing.  They need to slow down a bit here and listen more closely.  I think the dishes are probably pretty good here.  And the owner is right on site.  He was really busy too or I would have said something.  Just don't order the veal.  I'd stick to pasta and happy hour..."}
{"text":"What a great place to have dinner or grab a drink at the bar and listen to real music. The owner will make sure you come back. The staff is AMAZING!  Great wine selection and the gelato is to die for."}
{"text":"Great dining experience!  We arrived for dinner on a very busy night and did not have reservations.  They were quick to accommodate us and seated us immediately.  Our waiter, Chris, was excellent.  He was extremely personable and knowledgeable about the menu and wine list.  The food was excellent and all four of us really enjoyed our dinner.  We are looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"If you don't like or care about wine this is your place . Decor is nice energy good noise loud food some amazing some not so much . The pizza was the bomb this night . The soup was way bland . The portions are small but all in all the prices are fair . This would be a fun go to spot if not for the tragedy of a wine list . Until next time stay thirsty my friends I did ....."}
{"text":"Happy Hour at Bella Vita was wonderful. Sat outside and had the House Chardonnay and Shrimp Scampi. Great ambiance and even better service. This is going to be my new 'go to' establishment for Happy Hour in Green Valley!"}
{"text":"Great food and service, chef Ricardo accommodate our request and cook amazing food! Great job I'll be back soon...!"}
{"text":"Our server was excellent , he was a short young man I believe his name was Carlo,although he was busy he was very attentive ,wine glasses were never empty and the food was everything I expected for a beautiful intimate traditional Italian establishment! 5 stars hands down"}
{"text":"We have always had the best experiences and food at Bella Vita. Sergio and Nikolai make you feel like family . They are simply The Best !!!"}
{"text":"Service decent, food not. Went there for lunch and the place was empty! I now can see why! I ordered a very simple lunch and it was not tasty at all. What s disappointment! I have been wanting to try this place for a while. The menu was limited as well"}
{"text":"just walking around on the vicinity of Green Valley Casino. Because my wife and I are craving for a true Italian cuisine. And we found one in the corner...it seems they are new. So we give it a try. Our server by the name of Lorillo, suggest as a light meal since we were new in the place. He recommend to us The Frito Misto which we had for a appetizer. Also our Server suggest us his favorite pasta which is a Bucatini Amatriciana. And we were so happy about his suggestion and recommendation. Lastly my wife, and I had a Pannacota and Cannoli for our dessert. I would like to thank firstly our Server Lorillo, for taking care for us and makes our lunch very delightful and satisfied. Definitely we will be back. I do highly recommended this restaurant for someone craving for a true genuine service and service."}
{"text":"The owners of this restaurant are absolutely wonderful people. They take the time to talk to you and fully understand what you're looking for and everything is made fresh. The fresh made pasta is out of this world it makes you feel like you're sitting back in the old country enjoying dinner with family. After a nice cup of coffee and a tiramisu it was time to go to bed after a wonderful meal. thank you Bella Vita"}
{"text":"Wow this spot is amazing! Great service perfect location and the food is delicious
I love the patio seating with the live music. I highly recommend this place if you are ever in the mood for Italian food."}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday for lunch. The decor was not bad but nothing to write back home about. The restaurant was quiet with only a few other tables occupied.

I went in with a friend mainly for pizza and since i don't eat pizza too often, wanted something more special than the normal fast food fare. I tried the Italian sausage pizza and it was not bad but probably overpriced for what you get in my opinion.

The problem was the service. The waiter did not know how to pour sangria from a pitcher without emptying half the contents on the floor. When we said we needed one minute, it does not mean that we wanted to be left to rot for 15 mins while our waiter was completely out of sight. Our orders were brought to the next table and were only brought back after they had the time to season, pour olive oil and cut our pizza. The worse was when they brought the pizza as is, as if we would not notice.

And the cherry on top was the waiter whispering in my ear to not forget his 20% tip.

The location is probably the only thing it has going for this place and I am not as forgiving as Grace W. to give a star for location."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Food was really excellent, service was great and really enjoyed the live music and overall ambiance.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We won't be returning. Service is slow and confused.  Food is fair. Make certain to go over your bill carefully. Our group of 5 was overcharged nearly $60.  There were 3 extra entrees erroneously on our bill.  This was the second visit to the restaurant for 4 in the group, both times there were significant errors.  The management seemed unconcerned.  The restaurant is too noisy to talk. Oh well there are lots of other places to dine in the LV area."}
{"text":"Great pizza, nice relaxed environment. Loved that the kids could hang out and play games while we waited for pizza. Pizza Blanca and the Brooklyn Favorite pizzas were our picks for the night."}
{"text":"First time here on a lovely Friday evening.  Got there around 4 for drinks, stayed for dinner.  Good things...Decor was nice, loved the patio.

Had 2 different servers, both lovely.  Drinks were good, food was good, live music was very nice when set up.  

Bad things... Horrible, loud techno music from arrival until the live music started, really intolerable... Friends and family of the owners, loud obnoxious people, visitors hanging around them and all hovering around and over our table, children running all around and screaming...there from our arrival until right before we left.  2 very simple things ruined the experience, both management could have solved rather than caused..  

It could have been a wonderful evening, spent $250 for 3 people, probably the last..."}
{"text":"Always outstanding!  Fresh pasta, delicious sauces, and great service!  Give it a try...you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner tonight and loved it!  I wouldn't say the pizza is \"authentic\" in every right, but it was pretty close to the pizza we ate in 3 different Italian cities a few months ago. Even the pizza in Italy varies widely, so who's to say what's authentic anyway? 

Our waitress was more than we could have asked for. My husband and I were visiting Montreal with our two year old daughter and the entire staff there was very nice to her and went out of their way to throw out all the stops. We had a stroller and they were quite accommodating to that and gave us a place to store it away from our table. The waitress talked to our daughter and brought her markers and blank white placemats to draw on.  I have grown to appreciate the servers who acknowledge her presence beyond being an added mess maker, so when they go out of their way to engage with her, it makes me feel much more relaxed and welcomed as a guest. The bar staff, who prepared our drinks, put a little flower on her straw and didn't bat an eye when we asked for another straw because she broke hers. The waitress was attentive and didn't hover (I hate that) and because the restaurant is pretty small, was never very far away. 

I do agree that it's a little strange that they offer a note inside the check holders recommending a 15% tip for service, but not all countries tip their servers, so it's nice they offer that information. Besides, in the US at least I've seem many checks come with a \"tip table\" to show the customer how much a 10%, 15%, or 20% tip would amount to, which is pretty much demanding the same thing. We gladly tipped her this evening and I wouldn't let that deter me from going again. 

My only complaint is the bathroom was pretty much a sauna and very, very small so going there twice with my potty training child, wasn't the highlight of my dining experience, but who rates a restaurant for that???"}
{"text":"This could be a 5 star, but it's not! With the variety of different places in and around the district to be a 5 star you need to make no service mistakes and season your dishes better. Price is where it should be once the little mistakes have been taken care of, new restaurants need to hear what is wrong in order to earn 5 stars and I will be back to hopefully change my rating! Good luck for the future, great owner"}
{"text":"Ahh Bella Vita. This is my go to spot for my dog and I. Absolutely love sitting on the patio with my pooch, drinking some Cab and enjoying linguine with clams. I've always had good service here. But tonight, our patio love affair has came to an end. As I walked in with my furry little buddy, as I had done so many times before I was informed that dogs are no longer allowed. I was saddened by this news and was informed a server was bit. I totally get it, liability and what not. So if you're not traveling with your mutt, this is a fine place to dine and you will enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Walked in, sat down, and realized no one in the restaurant had any food on their tables. My food senses told me something was up so we quickly ran out the door after sitting at an empty table for 10 minutes. Good thing we did. Couldn't be happier after reading all of these reviews on Yelp. Beware!"}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service. We were seated right away and treated to nice warm bread and butter while we waited. The food was properly flavored and tasted good! We were seated near a beautiful view of the old port. All around nice experience."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST PASS!!!  I would have given a zero star if i had the option.  Not kidding we waited over 40 min for our apps, they weren't totally bad but not worth the wait. ( low end strip mall quality at best)  had a few pasta's which were bland and not at all memorable, they completely forgot to order our entrees, even after the server repeated the order back to us.  Not a single apology or anything just defended himself to the end.  at the least have a manager come over.  Rethink it guys!!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this place out for some time and finally got the opportunity. We were greeted at the door by Sophia, seated immediately, and then handed off to Michelle who brought us water, bread, and oil vinegar. Within a couple of minutes Ryan arrived, gave us the lowdown on the specials and answered all our questions. We arrived during happy hour (3-6) so we decided to try the happy hour calimari, a smaller portion than the regular menu with a price discount. Delicious! Crisp and clean. My GF ordered the linguine and clams, and I ordered the lasagna. One of these days I am going to leave my comfort zone and try something other than lasagna, but since it was our first time here, I had to try it. We both hit home runs. The number of clams (15-18), and the home made linguine in the garlic white wine sauce was amazing. I was very impressed with my lasagna as well, and I am not easily impressed. So many places tend to over do it but this was perfect. The perfect amount of meat, cheese, sauce and noodles! We finished it off with a dish of  panna cotta topped with pears soaked in a Pinot Noir and raspberry syrup. The whole experience was awesome and I can hardly wait to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent Hospitality, Excellent Food, Large Portions!!!  Can't say enough about the first visit.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Awful experience with my family, the pizza and adult beverages at best 1 star. Very hostile servers, what a dump. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! You would be sorry too."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour (3-6pm) with \"small plates\" and nice wines! The gnocchi is the best! I dreamt about it all day knowing I was coming to Bella Vita for dinner. The small plates is perfect for me with a salad."}
{"text":"Service, great. Coffee, good, unusual for most restaurants. Wife had the lobster, seafood dish and I had the best veal shank ever. We shared a tiramisu for desert and it was incredible. It will be our go to restaurant for Italian from now on."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and amazing food!! The seafood risotto was the best!! We also ordered lasagna, which was just as tasty and salmon with incredible whipped potatoes. Also, we enjoyed the Arancia Rosso blood orange cocktail. Molto bene!!"}
{"text":"I rarely rate 1 star but It was terrible service. The waiter was mad all the time. I guess he was not happy to work on Christmas eve around 8:30pm. At the end, he wrote down his tip at the end of the check. I really had when a waiter write or tells you that his tip is 15% or above. Seriously, I decide what I want to pay. His service did not deserve that much money. The waiter did not let us finish our wine when he was bringing the check. I will never go back to the restaurant. Food was ok nothing that I would like to try again. 
We ordered pizza, lasagna and steak et  frites."}
{"text":"I loved EVERYTHING about this restaurant!!! The service was awesome and you can't beat the comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. I would recommend either the Tartufata or the Gnocchi Alla Bolognese, I have never had such fresh and delicious pasta like this before. We will definitely come back here over and over again :)"}
{"text":"Disagree with bad reviews. Very positive experience. Three adults dining at 7pm on a Saturday night. Excellent service and great pizza. Not a fancy restaurants but delicious food and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"This restaraunt has the worst noise level I have experienced. I could barely hear the person sitting right next to me.  In addition the chicken fettuccini had such a thick, dry sauce throughout that it was like eating a pasty heap. It was cooled down after 4 bites. We waited 10 min. after everyone had finished eating to get plates cleared and another 5 min. before we could wave down our waiter for the check. All in all this was not enjoyable. Do not suggest."}
{"text":"An evening on the patio with good food, good wine and familia. Nothing better....Grazie!"}
{"text":"My wife, Pam, and I ate here for the second time.  Our server, Julio, did a good job telling us about the the soup of the day. He quickly brought us our San Pellegrino.  We ordered Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo and Chicken Piccata. Both were tasty.  We also ordered a Chianti and a Pinot Noir.  They were served at a Chardonnay level temperature- too well chilled for both red wines."}
{"text":"A friend and I went to Bella Vita for an early lunch during the week one day. We chose to sit on the outdoor patio which was really nice. I chose to have their Belavita salad which is on the small side for the price. It came with hearts of palm but they were few and far between. About a quarter of an avocado should've had at least been half of one. Not something I would order again. My friend ordered a glass of wine that was $8.00 but the server told her she could bring her something that she would like much better. My friend did enjoy the wine but when she got her check she noticed The price of the wine had gone from $8.00 to $14. When it was brought to the servers attention she said she could adjust the check to reflect the original $8.00 glass. Then when it was time for the server to bring her change she brought the correct amount in bills but she neglected to bring her $.69 in coins. We thought it was very presumptuous of her to assume she wouldn't want ALL her change. I've never been to a restaurant where they only gave you part of your change back. So she made it part of her tip. Doubt I'll be going back there again."}
{"text":"So yeah, we were walking through Montreal really hungry and we knew that this will be just another tourist trap - and it was. Worst service I ever had in Camada so far the waiter is a horrible person, as in other references already stated. At the end we were just giving him 5% tip and he was so pissed off and telling us that the tip is normally 15% and he has to pay taxes - dude, for 15 tip you need to smile at least or come over sometime to see if we want something. Food was okay tho, small portions, quite expensive (16 dollars + tax) but decent taste. Garlic bread was awful, bread with a little oil. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"Love this place! Managers are very professional...the bartenders are friendly once you become familiar. Food is presented well. They have gluten-free pasta!! They have good wine and yummy cocktails. Great music, a man and a woman singing easy listening tunes. Very romantic:) sit outside or inside. My suggestion is to try it on your next date night."}
{"text":"Very cute and warm place. Romantic lighting. Clogged toilet and a note written on the back of a receipt taped to the wall asking not to flush paper down the toilet. Classy. They had bowls that were too tall to mix oil and balsamic in. You either got too much oil, or by the time you ate all the oil all that was left was the balsamic. Tasty bread even though it was cold. 
We ordered a bottle of water for the table. When we finished it the waitress brought over another and opened it without asking us if we wanted it. She's got some balls, I'll give her that. When they brought over both the salads and our pasta dishes they did not set it in front of the right person both times, even with our waitress standing at the table with us.  The pasta portions were fair for my parents but my ravioli was not enough. I had 9 little raviolis, the filling portion being no bigger than a nickel. My mother complained that her carbonara dish was too salty. 
I ended up leaving hungry, dissatisfied and disappointed after my dad paid $90. If you're looking for good, authentic pasta, go to Pasta Ristorante on Horizon Ridge."}
{"text":"Ok food. A little crazy with people moving around the place. Paying for the location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience. We had an extraordinary dinner to start our evening. The service was impeccable and the food was just delicious. We stopped at the very friendly bar on the way out for a last drink before we left and the weather was so nice and the bartenders and other patrons so fun that we went outside to the patio bar and spent a few hours having just the best time with complete strangers and made some new friends. What a nice crowd Bella Vita draws. The bartenders and servers and the manager have a lot to do with this, that I am sure. They treat you like you are their guest. We will be back on a regular basis. For the fabulous food as well as the great service and the atmosphere they have created! Wonderful evening! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent evening. Fabulous environment - moorish nosh and fabulous martinis. We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I booked a reservation for our 5 year anniversary. We always would walk by with our son and say how nice this place looked. I have to say we were a little disappointed with our experience. When I first booked the reservation I stated it was our anniversary. That being said, I was expecting special treatment for my wife and I. When we checked in we were told that we could not sit outside although there were plenty of tables. The outside seating had a guitarist and would have set the night in motion. The hostess explained this area was for a large party. Regardless, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. We waited at our table for 15 minutes before our waiter arrived. He was very polite but we were starting on the wrong foot. So we ordered wine and food as we had plenty of time to decide. The wine came out and it was good. The food came out and it was so so. I was expecting something much more for the price we paid. A little a disappointed but I was with my love and we were able to laugh it off. Happy 5 Years! Probably won't come back. Nice waiter though..."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for over a year and it is an amazing resaurant. The food is fabulous ther service is so friendly! Just love it!  Give it a try, you will be back!"}
{"text":"Best place ever .. food.. service.. patio ... live music !!! Highly highly recommend !!! 6 stars !!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here a half dozen times. The food is excellent and deserves 4 or 5 stars. But the service, while friendly, is excruciatingly slow. Today a family group of 12 - 5 adults and 7 kids -we went for a lunch of salads and pizza. Our order was not complicated. The meal took 1-3/4 hours!!  The residents would absolutely love this restaurant if it just had quicker service. The food is good and the environment nice and the service friendly but it is so slow that I had to subtract 4 stars because of it."}
{"text":"This is me and my husband's fist time in this restaurant and we are in love with the food here! The atmosphere is great. Their seafood risotto dish with lobster & all is delicious. We were pleasantly surprised by this new restaurant.  Ryan was our server & he really took care of us.  Awesome service.  Great food.  New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Italian food with wonderful atmosphere.  A must-try for special occasions. Great lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"This was our second time at Bella Vita. We absolutely love the food and most of the employees. 

It was my moms birthday and Sergio (I think he's the manager...not sure) treated her as if she was his own mom. Great service. 

We ordered one of the specials which was the Seafood Risotto. Amazing! Nothing overpowering about this dish. Then fish was perfect, not chewy, and the sauce with Risotto was seasoned just right. The next dish was the Lobster Ravioli. It was very tasty, however there were only 6 or 7 on the dish. Next was the linguini with calms (white sauce). Again, cooked just right and not over bearing. Good amount of calms as well. 

The only negative thing I have to say was after dinner we decided to head outside to the bar area. I approached the bar to get a few drinks and the bartender working there ( didn't get his name) was a complete ass. He was rude and obviously couldn't handle the bar was, even though it's a very small bar with about 8 people actually sitting there. He may have been new. Even the restaurant was not super busy. I guess he didn't realize we spent over $200 on dinner. The outside wasn't managed very well. We finally got service and got our drinks. 

I would definitely return but not sit at the bar unless it's a different bartender."}
{"text":"What can I say great Italian food, staff and management... a real winner and dog friendly outside dining."}
{"text":"What an fantastic place! I had the Lobster Ravioli. A-Mazing!!! I ate every last bit of it. And for an after dinner drink, you have to try the LemonChello drink. Smooth, creamy, but high alcohol, proceed with caution. Service was on top of their game! Manager came to introduce himself to us. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nicolai (sorry if I misspelled), is like family.  I have been coming in since the very beginning & watched people come & go, but he remains the same.. along w/ the food!  Fantastic, fabulous & authentic!  

I know that I cannot upgrade per Yelp from five stars, but wish I could because there is a difference between the bar & dining room experience in many restaurants & today we sat in the dining area for the first time.  We are spoiled at the bar for many reasons.  Today, still five stars for Carlo & Nicolai in the dining area. 

Bread was moist & delish w/ the balsamic & EVOO dipping side.  Our Fritto Misto was cooked to perfection & I advise to get it as an appetizer, instead of a dollar more for the Calamari app, which is also great!  For a first timers, try a lil more variety w/ the Fritto Misto & also a large portion!  Delish & I love the Rapini instead of broccolini also.

My friend ordered the Chicken Ravioli, I wanted him to try my favs first of course lol, but his was so tasty & delish!!  Maybe one of my new favs!!  A bit of balsamic, from my usual, 'Melt-in-your-mouth' Grilled Octopus, touched a Ravioli & it actually enhanced the already savory flavor.  Love it & am so glad I introduced my friend to Bella Vita!"}
{"text":"Our family LOVES coming here to eat! The food is beyond delicious. Some of our favorites include, Bella Vita salad, calamari friti, gnocchi, sausage spinach ravioli and more. Juan Marco has been our server and gives awesome and prompt service. Don't forget the dessert!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. Happy hour had great selections. Be wary of the 20% off coupon for the first order. They gave 20% off the lowest price entree."}
{"text":"Probably the best Italian food we ever had. Wife had spinach ravioli and I had the plain old spaghetti with meat sauce. Everything was cooked perfectly and we just bookmarked this place. Wow."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a friend & I was highly disappointed when I brought my family in to celebrate my Mom's birthday. When I called to make the reservation they asked if we were celebrating anything special that day so I made them aware & there was no mention of it during our time there. 
The service was horrible, we were not provided plates or utensils for appetizers. I kept having to ask for spoons & napkins etc ... 
The appetizers were horrible, 5 rings of raw calamari & basically a tasteless watery bowl of shrimp scampi . Our entrees were just as bad & my brother & I were having a skin reaction to the not so fresh sea food. On top of that the server came around non stop trying to take the plates when it was obvious we were still in the middle of trying to eat the meal. I will not be coming back & I won't recommend this place. I understand if a restaurant has an off day but the entire experience from start to finish was a huge expensive disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  This is quality food.  Chef style quality.  Had the chicken scallopini and it was amazing.  Service good.  Open late and nice interior. Will be back.  Gonna try the pizza next time.  Its REAL pizza.  Not even sure they have pepperoni.  Sometimes thats a good thing. Waiting for dessert as i write this.  Okay dessert arrived...panna cotta with poached pears.  Omg...amazing!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food in an upscale casual atmosphere. Love their cocktail hour daily here and in the District. Open and airy inside and a great outdoor patio area for seating as well. All of the menu is delicious I praise the \"real Italian\" restaurants that make their own pasta and more importantly make the food to order the way YOU want it! I don't like red sauce (yes it's a shocker) and most dishes are primarily made this way. I love that every time I've been here if I see something I would love but it's prepared red they automatically say we will make it with ANY sauce you like, yes thank you!!! So needless to say I am always more then happy with my dishes here. From starters, to main dishes, to dessert \"cannolis\", to cocktails and house made Limoncello \"sooooo yummy\" it's a great place with really good prices."}
{"text":"The gnocchi is out of this world! I can't seem to order anything else!  Love it! It's the best I've had at any restaurant here."}
{"text":"This place is great ! Went in with my boyfriend for dinner all the staff was very friendly and had no problem telling us there favorites. I ended up getting a Margarita pizza and it was delicious ! Only think I would change is that there was a lot of mozzarella on the pizza where a true Margarita pizza has a less but either way it was to die for! My boyfriend ended up getting there Lasagna and he loved it! The whole atmosphere of this place was great we ended up sitting outside and got to people watch which is always a plus! Even though we were stuffed the server recommended that we get there house cannolis and we did which was delicious as well! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a taste of Italian for dinner!"}
{"text":"Great service, great ambiance, and yummy food! Then you can walk around the District afterwards! :)"}
{"text":"Short Rib Special...Delicious!! Ask for David, his service and expertise is unmatched! Great atmosphere, bring the friends and family!! Highly recommended for authentic Italian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Well, I read the reviews and since this restaurant was in a great location, we still decided to give it a try.

The food as many of the reviews indicated is ok.  I don't think I would say its bad but it definitely could  be improved.

Thank goodness for our waiter Amen.  If not for his friendly interaction and helpful advice to view the fireworks tonight, I'd probably agree with 2.5 stars rounding up to three stars but since Amen helped make our evening fun and enjoyable at Bella Vita, I'm upping their rating to four stars!

Thanks Amen!

My advice, ask for Amen and at least if your food isn't that great, you will still have a nice evening!"}
{"text":"Our first dinner at Bella Vita....  My friend and I were craving pasta and wine....  We are had lasagna and fettuccine... Relish!  And we had the most charming waiter.  We will be back for dessert!"}
{"text":"Sat outside. Very nice ambiance, but food and server were not the best. I am very allergic to tomatoes and made that very clear to server. We decided to share the antipasti dish, described as meats, cheeses,olives.
When the server brought to table, he said he made sure the tomatoes did not touch anything. How could that be when a lot of the mozzarella was on top of the tomatoes. I could not eat the mozzarella and should have sent the whole dish back, but did not want to get into it.
My husband ordered the shrimp frances described by waiter as very lightly floured shrimp in a lemon and white wine sauce.
There was no sauce and the breading was thick. The shrimp still had the tails on which was also breaded, so a lot of it ended up in his mouth. Very disappointed.
On the up side, the bread was great as was my salmon dish"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place based on good recommendations; but was very disappointed.  The staff was great; but the food was just blah.  The bolognese was referred to as hamburger helper and really it was an accurate description.  The lasagna special was similarly flavored.  Both were delivered cold to our table and had to be sent back.  They have an open kitchen and we could see the cook's offended reaction when our server presented the food back to him. We shared a pizza for an appetizer and it was good; not great...also not very hot; but we didn't complain.  It was a cold night and the door wasn't closing properly so we dined with our coats on. The owner came by and was disgruntled about the door; but we had to request him to turn up the heat...why didn't he think of that?  Nor did he ask us about our food or dining experience...missed opportunity sir.  The place has a nice vibe and a great little bar...I'd go back for a drink and maybe an appetizer or pizza; but not going to pay for another disappointing dinner.  Hope they can improve; we'd like to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My new favorite Italian spot!! They have happy hour 3p-6p 7 days a week and a nice outdoor patio seating for those cool Vegas nights! Not to mention the patio is pet friendly! We were immediately greeted by Sergio, the owner, and was walked through the menu since it was our first time. Sat at the bar patio side with Jenny and had an amazing dinner. Started with wine, and had the chef add angel hair pasta to the shrimp scampi appetizer for a complete meal. Not to mention my favorite part.....HOMEMADE PASTA!!!!!! Finished with a must have homemade tiramisu Cant wait to come back with friends"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant and it was a great unexpected surprise. The minestrone was perfect. The panini very good and the fries, just like in Rome (a little muchy) :)
The service was a 10. Very polite and attentive.
The desert was a panacota that was very good. It wasn't perfect for me because I like berries and it came without it, but the taste is as real as it gets. This was better than Sinatra's @ Encore. 
I will be returning here as often as I can.
Recommend to anyone that enjoys"}
{"text":"Date night with the hubs; won't be back to the place.  Bad service...We were seated at a table that was beyond wobbly to the point where if we lightly bumped it our drinks spilled.  The hostess said she would fix it, but forgot & didn't take care of it until the end of our meal.

Drinks were empty for some time.  Our meals also took almost 40 minutes to come out.  I ordered salmon, which was forgettable.  The salmon I season & bake from Smith's is better.  Meals were a little on the pricey side; came out to about $40 per person.  I don't mind paying more if the quality is there, but it was average.  We will head back to Bottiglia at GVR for date nights."}
{"text":"Ordered a take out. And the food is very mediocre. 
The pasta with mushrooms is really dry and no flavor to it. And the caprese salad seems like the tomato was cooked. It's very sawgie. Don't need to order from there ever again.. I'm very sad and unsatisfied. Looked promising.."}
{"text":"Bella Vita is the restaurant located in Presidio Residents Club in Estrella Mountain Ranch.  While the menu is small, the food is consistently tasty.  They offer food such as pizzas, paninis, salads, cheese plates, bruschetta, etc.  I find the service to be good and the staff is very friendly.  Even when I have dined in on busy evenings I have never waited long for my meals.  I recommend trying the Build you own Bruschetta board which allows you to choose 3 out of 5 flavor options.  My favorites are as follows:
Brie, apple, andfig
Cucumber, feta, and balsamic reduction
Apple, mascarpone, honey, and almond"}
{"text":"First off Kelly, the bartender was just amazing. She answered every question about the menu and made some great recommendations. The Fritto Misto is sensational with crispy rapini and just the right amount of red sauce. The shrimp and calamari were cooked to perfection. Kelly
recommended a pasta dish with penne, peas, mushrooms and it was simply WOW! She kept us entertained as we enjoyed our experience at the bar. Then I asked a guy in a suit if he was the manager, so I could give Kelly kudos... Well, turns out is was Sergio the Owner! He spent time with us going over all this amazing place has to offer, including sensational music and outdoor seating. All in all, this is a must try. We reserved a spot for our family when they visit from CA in a couple weeks. Great food and great people!"}
{"text":"Good food but service is horrible here. My family has celebrated 5 birthday dinners here and we have had numerous dinners here with friends that were visiting us from out of town. We decided to sit outside last time we were dining, waiter never refilled our waters. We asked 2 times for water refills and more bread. Never showed up so we walked up to the bar and asked for 2 waters. We enjoy coming to the district and dining here, but the service leaves such a horrible taste in our mouth"}
{"text":"I was staying at the Green Valley Ranch, and this place a hop, skip, and a jump away. It was nice to get out of the hotel/casino. We had the heirloom tomatoes and beat salad, and bruschetta as appetizers. They were both very good. The raspberry champagne vinaigrette was amazing. I had the chicken parmigiana which was good, but one of my co-workers has the gnocchi with Bolognese sauce and that was fantastic. The atmosphere was nice and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I disagree...best server is Lynn!  This great place has been a wonderful addition to the neighborhood! I always feel welcome and special when I come here!  Great food, great drinks with great friends!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience ... Love the ambience and the patio dining."}
{"text":"I was at happy hour and we enjoy our environment the activities our food was excellent the service was of high-quality it was wonderful I wish this restaurant nothing but the best I hope they're around for many more happy hours for me to attend"}
{"text":"Music is sublime and romantic.  Food is good.  I mean. AWESOME.  Staff and atmosphere makes for a great night out in the town. A perfect ending to a perfect day.  David is the best !!!!"}
{"text":"Barry is the best!
I brought my family in as I often do and we recently had a daughter diagnosed with a Gluten allergy.  We explained this to Barry and not only did he execute on identifying menu items that she could have, he went out of his way to ensure she would receive a great meal (GF penne bolognese) and he even offered her a gluten-free dessert!  She had been having a tough time eating out because she doesn't get to enjoy all of the offerings like her brothers and sister.  However, Barry made this lunch exceptional and made her feel special.  We come in there often and enjoy the staff.  We will keep coming back and highly recommend this place to our friends.  I run a resort in town and understand exceptional service.  This place continues to execute at a high level and the staff makes the experience 5-Star every time!  Thanks guys!!"}
{"text":"We visited Bella Vita over the weekend,Excellent customer service,  if your looking for Authentic Italian food this is the place, The pasta was delicious and home made, the cannoli's are amazing , the ambiance is great we really enjoyed the live music,  I do recommend making reservations .  Great experience overall  MUST TRY !!!!"}
{"text":"Great server. We sat outside and it was really nice weather. So that helped!
Now the food: mixto was excellent! A friend had pasta and lobster and was very happy. I took a bite of my other friend's Salmon and it was so good! My steak was the best I had in a really long time! The mushrooms were delicious as well. The food took a really long time (according to me) my friend said it didn't. The restaurant was packed. 
But at the end it was worth the wait. They just opened so I'm thinking they will tune in very soon. Everything was very good! Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Everything here was amazing. Great atmosphere with live piano. Highly recommend the antipasto plate and bolognese. I LOVE panna cotta and this was the best I have ever had. Great date spot!"}
{"text":"First time dining at Bella Vita this evening.  My husband and daughter had the Chicken Parmesan.  Both said the chicken was chewy and tasted as though it could have been frozen. My pasta was good, but not great.  Disappointing meal overall."}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food was the service. The first time dining here it was close to closing and we were greeted with a a smile and a great table. The food was authentic, fresh and delicious. Best I have had since I was in Sicily. I hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try something different for dinner.  Since we hadn't dined at Bella Vita we wanted to give it a go.  

We started off with the Antipasto Misto.  Some of the meats were good, some were not up to par in quality.  We also wanted to try their meatballs.  This I would definitely pass on in the future.  The meatballs were very soggy with a bland flavor.  Very disappointing.  

They had a special on the board for the Bay Shrimp Risotto.  I am a huge lover of risotto.  This one missed the mark.  It wasn't as creamy as most risotto's I've enjoyed.  There was a different flavor that really didn't compliment the dish.  

I was really hoping for more from this restaurant.  Like the service, everything was underwhelming."}
{"text":"I would like to respond to the review of Jessica W.
I do not agree with you at all, I have been going to this restaurant since it's opening and the food is EXCELLENT authentic italian, it is not true what you state in your review that in the District there are other better places to eat italian, I am italian and I was born in ITALY and believe me the food at BELLA VITA RESTAURANT is as you would be eating at a restaurant in Italy, I go there 4 times a week to eat, also their staff is excellent, seems that some people do not understand what good food is"}
{"text":"This is me and my wife's fist time in this restaurant and we are in love with the food here! The atmosphere is great. Their seafood risotto dish with lobster & all was delicious. Veal Marsala was awesome. We were pleasantly surprised by this new restaurant.  Ryan was our server & he really took care of us.  Awesome service.  Great food.  New favorite spot!"}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas, we met friends for dinner at Bella Vita.  I saw the bad reviews on Yelp, which I simply cannot understand.  The staff - both bar staff, and waitstaff, were incredibly friendly, helpful and attentive.  The portions of the food were very large - my wife got the Osso Bucco, and I got the Tagliatelle with Bolognese sauce.  We could have shared the Osso Bucco, it was such a large filling portion.  The food was delicious.  I just came from West Hollywood, and the food here is every bit as good as top Italian restaurants in LA.  I think that people get offended when they are charged a lot of money for dinner, and this place is certainly not cheap.  They serve great food, and great drinks, and they charge a lot of money to eat here.  I understand that if you cannot afford to eat here, it might offend you.  My pasta dish (which was wonderful) was $18 dollars.  Cocktails were $11 - $13 dollars.  Everything was great.  If that is outrageously expensive for you, perhaps you should find a place that meets your budget."}
{"text":"We came here last night for the first time and loved the ambiance right away. We ordered the antipasto as an appetizer, it was a tasty start to accompany my glass of merlot. For the main course, I opted for the clam linguini in red sauce. It was delicious, with a hearty serving of clams (in the shell). The sauce had a bit of a spicy kick which I loved. The cheerful wait staff was pleasant. This is a great place for locals to enjoy drinks or dinner, with a lovely patio seating option for dining al fresco. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Okay food, semi-rude service. 

We stopped in for a late dinner (~9.45pm) and the waiter happily welcomed us in. The food was alright, nothing special but not terrible either. Then, at 10.30pm, just as we were finishing our drinks, they turned the music off and turned on the lights - it was a strange way to basically kick us out, even though we had paid and were about to leave! 45 mins-an hour for dinner is not overly lengthy - if they didn't want to stay open, they could have simply said when we walked in the door."}
{"text":"Met friends here for dinner and conversation. Would have loved to dine out on the patio, which seemed lovely, with a guitarist, but too hot and muggy. So we were shown a table indoors. David, our server, came by almost immediately to take the drink orders and go over the specials. He strongly rec'd the seafood risotto special. I'm not a fan of scallops. No problem says David, they will pull out the scallops and add in extra shrimp. And so they did. The focal point of the dish was the lobster tail in an opened shell in the middle of the dish. Perfect!!! Presentation with a perimeter of mussels and clams. All of a bed of risotto with a very tasty sauce. David did not lie. This is truly an outstanding dish. My wife went with the veal marsala. Also excellent. Service throughout the meal was close to perfect. At the end of the meal, David brought by a small glass of Lemoncello for each of us courtesy of the manager. Nice touch!! So why not 5 stars? My buddy ordered the lasagna. He was very disappointed - mediocre at best.
They do have a Yelp check in offer. A little strange - 20% off your first order. They explained it to be 20% off the second most expensive entree ordered. Also a nice touch.
An excellent addition to Green Valley Village Walk. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed Happy Hour at Bella Vita last night with a girlfriend. I made an OpenTable reservation, though it wasn't necessary. I arrived and was told they prefer we sit at the bar for HH which happened to open up just as I arrived. There are three cocktails on the HH menu, I ordered the elderflower one and my friend ordered the blood orange one. We ordered the penne alla vodka and gnocchi alla pesto. The bartender asked if we wanted bread alongside our meal to which we replied yes. 

My drink had a freshness to it while my friend's was just sour with nothing to bite the tart. The penne pasta was cooked to less than al dente and we found it to be very dry and lacking flavor. The bread was never brought out and I had to ask for it. The best part of the meal was the gnocchi. The pesto sauce was done beautifully and there was plenty to be able to dip into with the bread. The bartender was very cold and awkward. When I arrived there was a couple seated whom she may have known and she chatted with them the entire time. Each time we asked her for something her lack of facial expression came off as we were inconveniencing her. When I asked if we would still be getting our bread she barely responded let alone said sorry and walked off to grab it. 

Happy Hour is really short - only until 6. Would be nice if it was extended to 7. The live music in the back is a nice touch. Ambiance is nice though you don't get to enjoy it sitting at the bar. The outdoor seating area is very inviting for warmer weather."}
{"text":"This place is great! The location is great and the atmosphere is perfect for a family gathering or even just meeting up with friends. The happy hour menu has a great selection and all the plates are $7! There's no where else you can find a great deal like that!"}
{"text":"The positive: the flower on my food looked good and the bartenders were pleasant. The wine selection was reasonable and prices okay, assuming they pour four to the bottle. Nonetheless, this was hands down the worst meal I have eaten out during my first year in Vegas. I was seated by some unhappy-seeming fellow. He seated me at the bar. Bar seating is okay. You learn a lot about a restaurant. Here, I watched servers (not the bartenders) use their hands to take care of their noses. No hand washing before they picked up drinks. The chicken marsala lacked flavor and any sense of soul. In other words, it was terrible. The vegetables were cold. In fact, some were room temperature. As I write this, I'm at my local Cheesecake Factory washing the mediocrity out of my mouth with a top shelf margarita. Thankfully, the bartender here (who has been here as long as I've been coming here and is great) understood the predicament. It's too bad I didn't just start here..."}
{"text":"The food at this place is, in a word, PHENOMENAL!  You can tell they obsess over every dish.  Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff.  I would recommend this only to people that want a most enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"First time.....and if we lived here we probably wouldn't return. My homemade pasta was delicious - but my husband got the seafood risotto and said it was 'meh'. Very bland (which doesn't bother me) but he said the seafood was dry and had no flavor. I got meatballs on the side...not sure why as my meal had a really good meat sauce...but hubby said they weren't so good. We love Italian food and I read this place is new. Service was good and the bar and outside looks great - so try it!"}
{"text":"The food was good and so was most of the service. We went for lunch on Valentine's Day and it took a while for the server to come over. The server was very friendly, but she poured us a refill glass of wine we didn't order and didn't give us a chance to refuse, and then charged us for it. We were too uncomfortable to say anything, but don't like being charged for things we didn't want. The busser was great and very attentive."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and servers!  Food was excellent. And presentation was nice. We had lots of extra food to take home just from lunch. We will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Bella Vista's HH was highly recommended to me by a friend who lives in the GVR area, so I invited her out one evening to try it. Their HH menu includes discounted wines and a large variety of $7 small plates.

Their house cab was a solid pick, and according to their social media, you can get a free glass of wine with an entree purchase- so come on a day when you can imbibe. My friend prefers the Duck Horn Merlot, which was very good.

We shared about half of their small plates menu, 5 of their 12 offered dishes. While the portion sizes for the pasta dishes were a good value, some of the others didn't seem like a great deal. The bolognese pasta and the shrimp scampi were the best of what we tried, while the calamari, meatballs, and burrata were average to underwhelming. 

I would come back to try more of their HH specials or for a dinner date. I especially want to try their special star-shaped pizza that I've heard good things about. They have a shaded outdoor patio with live music, perfect for warmer weather."}
{"text":"The service here is wonderful but the food is not... I base my decision off the lasagna and the lasagna was tasteless and inedible. I unfortunately had to return it and that's always a downer. The appetizer was over coated with breading, just a letdown all together except for the very friendly service. It's such a beautiful location, I really hope they change a few things."}
{"text":"Very refreshing. Not your typical cookie cutter Italian restaurant. The garlic oil we requested with the bread was top notch. Pizza is the perfect combination of everything right. Pasta was exceptional. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"This little nook was just a great location for a quick stop. Last summer,  It was a hot day so my friend and I decided to get a pitcher of Sangria, out on patio. It was actually not bad, they through in fresh apples and strawberries which made quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time. Salad was good. Lentil soup was a little bland and carrots were so precisely cut I suspect they were frozen
Tito's Martini was great. That's good because they had one Chardonnay by the glass, Poppy. Light to medium body - they were out of what I wanted, Sonoma-Cutrer. So had to have a second Martini. I had the Salmon, which was Great. Hubby had the Lasagna. Way TOO cheesy with a layer of fat skimming the surface. Won't get that again. Hubby also had a side of Brussel Sprouts with Pancetta. Good thing, they were fabulous . Waiter & buss staff were excellent . Hostess needs to get a personality or stay home."}
{"text":"I had been there once before and really enjoyed it, so this time I brought other friends to enjoy it as well. My first problem was my outside seating for 8 that was reserved, was not available when I arrived. The manager did finally help me in making it available but it did mean waiting much longer. The food is great but NONE of us liked our waiter, Sean.  He was so arrogant and took so long for anything! I later told my husband that that guy didn't make
Me feel good to be there. I really wished we gone somewhere else for our friends get together."}
{"text":"Came to celebrate a friends birthday tonight.  Service was a little slow which is unusual for them.  The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"We had dinner reservation at 9:45 on a Saturday night about 2 wks ago. Restaurant was not busy, yet it took our waiter over 15 minutes to come by our table. He was a little snooty and seemed like he was annoyed that he had a late table. He was not engaging at all. When we asked for more bread, the busser ( we asked for our waiter but he was nowhere to be found) told us they had no more bread ---- Seriously??! We asked how come and since he spoke very little English, we had to wait for someone else for an explanation. Food was mediocre at best. I ordered linguini and clams, which consisted of some linguini tossed with oil and garlic and a few clams placed around the plate. The gnocchi was meh at best ......  It felt as though they were not happy about a late reservation and pour their frustration into the servicing of our table. Don't take late reservations if you're going to treat your customer badly. Not sure we'll ever go back. Way better restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Rude- unprofessional service
My friend and I went on Saturday night to have dinner. We had to ask for some bread , it was not offered to us. The food was ok nothing special. The wine cheap and tasted horrible. The staff very unprofessional, one of the girls, we had to ask her twice for everything because apparently she was not paying attention to what we were saying. I could see from my table how the waiter was complaining to another waiter about a tip another table left, the customers were still in the restaurant and these two waiters kept looking at them and complain about the tip, I was not close to them but I could still hear them! Around 10:30 they started cleaning up and turning the lights off! We were still eating, I asked what time did they close and they told me 11:00... It was 10:30! So rude!!!! So we ate fast and left. When it was time to leave the waiter complained to my friend that the tip was not good enough ( she added 15% to the bill) and my friend, bless her heart cancelled the transaction and added more money to the tip. He did not deserve it!  I would not go back to this place. The staff needs a change of attitude"}
{"text":"Very good, homemade pasta...excellent service and atmosphere!  We sat outside last night and enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for good friend special birthday told our wait person this plus she told them when she made the reservation ar 6:00 pm on a Sunday night they did NOTHING!! Server barely acknowledge us! Wait Ed extra long on everything! Poor service my opinion over priced especially on drinks!! Ordered salmon with potatoes and veggies asked If I could get pasta instead of potatoes yes dish comes . Pasta and salmon no veggies ask server he bought the veggies,! Really I only changed the potatoes not the whole dish!! Poor poor! No plan to go back!"}
{"text":"I've got to say, I loved this place!  I'll start by saying that the food wasn't perfect but it was pretty darn good!  My friend and I arrived on a perfect day, sun shining, slight breeze, low 70's weather and lucky for us they have a beautiful patio which we could sit on and enjoy this blessing of a day.  It was happy hour and little did we know it but we were in for a treat.  My friend and I tried almost every food item (as they were each $7 and actually a good size, even though they were half portion) on their happy hour menu and each had a cocktail as well.  The food and drinks were all as beautiful as the setting.  Bright, full of both color and flavor, everything was quite satisfying.  
Our waiters were very attentive and informative and even asked our opinions which was very nice.  You can tell they want to make everything as pleasing as they can.  Near the end of our meal a musician came onto the patio and began playing live which was a treat.  
I will definitely come back here to eat, heck even to just grab a drink and sit on their patio and people watch.  This is a good place and I can't wait to see what it becomes after it establishes itself a bit longer and I can assure you I will be along for the ride."}
{"text":"Bella Vita seemed like the place to go in the district, so we tried it out. I got the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken added on. The pasta was less than stellar and the chicken was dry. Other members of my group had a similar experience with their food. The service was mediocre at best. There was one guy who was very kind, but in general the workers were a little blah. Wouldn't recommend..."}
{"text":"First time here. Made reservations I recommend for Friday or Saturday nights. Sat inside live band outside. The food is really good. Busy noisy open kitchen but worth it for the fresh pasta!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place! Great location and outdoor seating. We were promptly seated so things started off great. Food... frozen calamari barely heated was a huge turn off!!! Not worth the money. My friend ordered a Ceasar Salad.... but where was the dressing!?!! It took about 30 minutes to bring out the food with SEVERAL inquiries. Horrible."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Henderson highly recommended great service great food
Love the seafood risotto"}
{"text":"Best food and a great service! They hosted 2 parties for me. We had a great time. All my guests loved the food and the service. They always accommodate me since I don't eat garlic. The owners always go to the tables and check with their guests to make sure they are happy. Very friendly staff. I  highly recommend This place."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Friday evening. The restaurant was quite busy, but they were able to seat us right away. The service is good and the decor is nice.

We ordered Linguini with Clams (White Sauce) and a Gnocchi Alla Bolognese. My linguini was fairly mediocre. The clams were there, but barely. I'm not sure if I'd ever seen clams that small before. The gnocchi was bad. The dish was cool and the gnocchi itself was soggy and squishy.

The servers very accommodatingly replaced the gnocchi with another dish that was okay.

Overall, an unfortunate experience at a very nice location. We don't mind higher prices if the quality is there, it just doesn't feel like it here."}
{"text":"So glad this new option opened up in the district. The happy hour is really nice with a good variety of dishes. The staff and managers are always so nice and friendly. We usualy sit at the bar and make new friends on each visit.
I've been here about 6 or 7 times now and loved each visit."}
{"text":"Delicious meal at Bella Vita!! I am loving this place! Great food, friendly staff, & inviting atmosphere!  Live music several nights a week, great happy hour food & drink specials from 3pm-6pm.  If you have not yet tried this gem in The District, you must do so!! Bella Vita is THE place to go!"}
{"text":"Great little spot in the heart of The District. Our server Carlo recommended the Special which was Seafood Risotto..it was fantastic. Drinks were delivered quickly as well as hot bread. Amazing experience thanks to the great service from our server and the amazing food and ambiance. Must try in Henderson."}
{"text":"My wife and went with a group of ten , the service from Carlo was awesome. The food was. Spot, three people in our group had Fruiti de mar, the tagliatelle with bolognese was wonderful. It would impossible not recommend this great restaurant"}
{"text":"Food great. Service great. Who is the genius who decided a sax with canned background was appropriate?? I do not enjoy yelling to be heard."}
{"text":"Love this place! 
Portions are big. Two girls and after one appetizer we got full... we ordered one pizza and one pasta with misto something appetizer! It was just amazing. We both had to drive so didn't drink. But they have plenty of red and white wine options. But not so much of cocktail. Overall, everyone was nice and good was amazing. I strongly recommend this place to everyone!!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and great service. My wife had the lobster ravioli and I had the homemade lasagna. The lasagna was okay but her ravioli was out of this world insanely good. I had 1 beer and she had 1 margarita. Reason for 4 and not 5 stars, lasagna and the price of the drinks. Overall, I would recommend but have dinner there then cocktails a short walk to the other restaurant in the corner by GVR!"}
{"text":"Just average. Server was nice, busser didn't bring refill until after I got my check (maybe 10-15min after I asked and maybe 4 tables with guests?), lukewarm calamari, heavy Caesar dressing on my salad that made it a bit soggy. After a $31 check for 1 person for lunch, I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience here Friday night. Took a date for dinner and we sat on the patio to try and enjoy the music. The table next to us had a big group of people that were all standing and visiting and the blatantly in our personal space. I tried not to focus on that in anticipation of a delicious meal. My date ordered the Tagliatelle Bolognese and I ordered the featured Steak. Our server either awkwardly approached the table or avoided us altogether because his path was being blocked by the big group that was standing and visiting around us.

When the food finally arrived it was delivered by a food runner not our server. Usually it is common practice for the server to check on and see how the first couple of bites taste. The mashed potatoes that were part of my steak were ice cold. After about 5 minutes of still no server I flagged someone else down and asked them to send over our server. I told him the potatoes were cold and he said he would \"take care of it\". I could see the kitchen from our table and he handed the plate back to one of the cooks.

Now I have worked in kitchens before and anytime a plate is returned you do your best to make sure it is perfect the second time around. After a minute or two I saw my plate sitting on the counter and the server was standing back near a drink station. No one from the kitchen flagged him down and he was not alert and staying on top of the situation eventually the plate came back and again the potatoes were cold. I was not happy. By this time my date only had a few bites left so I wasn't about to send it back twice. The server never stayed and asked me to check the potatoes and no manager or anyone else came by to apologize or ask us how everything went. When the check came there was nothing taken off of the bill or any offering of a free dessert. The way I see it there were many opportunities to salvage my experience and get my business back. I left feeling disappointed and annoyed."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner experience on 12/25.
It was the only (or almost the only) restaurant opened than day.

My girl friend had the 4 cheeses pasta and I had the 4 cheeses pizza.
Both dishes were pretty good.

For desert, the chocolate mousse was airy and tasted delicious"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great place to come with family and friends or a special date night. This has been the 3rd time and my wife and I are celebrating an anniversary. We had Carlo as our server and he did an excellent wine pairing and meal recommendations. The food is excellent and the service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Bella Vita is located in the district in Green Valley. We made reservations with friends for dinner and were quickly seated upon arrival.

We perused the wine menu and decided upon a red Cabernet and a white Riesling. For dinner ordered the chicken piccata and the tagliatelle bolognese. Both were very good and tasted exceptionally well 5/5. The wine sauce on the chicken piccata and flavor was delicious 5/5. Sitting outside on the patio was nice in the evening and they even had live music. 

All in all a good dinner with friends and nice atmosphere.

2017 review #1"}
{"text":"We were joining a couple here, and didn't pick the restaurant. Obviously not kid friendly:

- Surprised that they actually had a kid menu complete with cartoons to color. Not surprised that they didn't offer crayons. I had a pen in my purse.
- Surprised they had a booster seat.
- Not surprised that they didn't know what was actually on their kids menu - at the top it says 'all kids meals include a drink'. We ordered a milk... they charged us $3 for the milk as they said it wasn't included. Even McDonalds includes this.  When I showed them the menu, they just said 'sorry' and still charged us $3. Really bad service. They then told us ice cream was included - which wasn't in their menu. 

They might serve adults well here, but with children, they're a hot mess. Their management is terrible as they should have removed the milk from the tab based on their menu and courtesy, but were rude about it."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 9. Waiter took order, kept skipping people and forgetting that he'd already asked others. Couple items ordered didn't make it to the table, one salad and one drink. I asked about 5-6 items on the menu and if they contained any dairy and ended up ordering the spaghetti pomodoro. It arrived covered in cheese, and when i told the waiter he told me that the cheese on top wasn't cheese. He then took it back and had it replaced. The serving size for my 13 dollar bowl of pasta was about 30% larger than the kids portion that my 2 year old easily finished."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance & authentic Italian food here. Very tastey. Will def be returning as it's quickly becoming one of my favorite spots. Drinks are delicious too!"}
{"text":"The food and the customer service is great! Also, I love the location.  We always go for a nice walk after eating here. I got the seafood which was amazing and my son loves his pasta boloñesa."}
{"text":"Haha read the first review and literally laughed out loud (llol'ed?), that guy obviously had a bone to pick. This place is STELLAR! Phenomenal service with exceptional food! We had the sea bass which was literally cooked to utter perfection and OMG the gnocchi was OUT OF THIS WORLD... just soft enough not too much flour not too little, and cooked perfectly aldente! The service was just ridiculously awesome, they held the chair for my wife, placed the napkin in our laps, constantly thanked us.... it was an evening to remember and we will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here but certainly not the last.  Authentic Italian is a must...live music & beautiful weather...oh my!  #KeepItRio"}
{"text":"Ugh the worst. 16 $CAD for a personal size pizza. 8 for a pint of beer. Other entrees are about 25$.

Food is mediocre, staff are slow to respond. prices are extortionate, but this is all to be expected for this tourist trap. Eat here only If you have to, there's nothing to recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been to Bella Vita 3 times now, including last night for my Birthday dinner. Each time I have been impressed with how delicious the food is and how wonderful the service is! The restaurant is gorgeous and elegant yet casual and comfortable. The patio is so nice and relaxing and the live music is great. They also have the best house made tiramisu I've ever had. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys great Italian food and a wonderful ambiance."}
{"text":"Really a 4.5 but you can't give that rating. Great happy hour with lots of options all at $7.    We enjoyed everything we ordered and will come back to try the full menu at dinner point."}
{"text":"Food was good, extremely small servings. The taste was there but nothing very specials ambiance is nice, service is Ok. They will need to work on the portion size. We left hungry and not satisfied at all. Wine selection is nothing to Brag about. I hope the place gets better because its a very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have got to say this is definitely the worst so-called Italian food I have ever eaten! The minestrone soup was absolutely not good whatsoever! The beans seemed dry and gritty and it wasn't even an authentic minestrone soup! It seemed very much like a can of Campbell's minestrone soup! I ordered the chicken parmesan and it was definitely not chicken that I was eating! The chicken seemed very stringy and rubbery and I could not even eat 3 bytes of the chicken parmesan! And the marinara sauce seemed very sweet and the noodles were very al Dante!! My waitress done a great job and was very attentive but I have to say you are way better off going to Olive Garden and eating there! I urge you to stay far away from this restaurant especially for the price you would pay! And when the manager came over to apologize for the food you could definitely tell that his apology was not sincere! The guy couldn't even look me in the eyes and give me a sincere apology! Stay away don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Eating at Bella Vitta makes me extremely jubilant !!!!  The atmosphere is vibrant, and \"O Dio  BUONISSIMO Abbiocco! \"-mama mia.  
Ranging from my favourite Italian dishes to the most friendliest people working here!!! the place is truly culture connect and has the most magnificent tasting Italian food.  It is also a small step from my front door,  then an expensive flight to my moms house.  
There is really no big difference between lunch or dinner, The food is just that good; however one does get entertainment from a guitar player at night.  
Short Ribs  -simply to die for. 
Lasagna. -nature's most perfect food.  
Taglioni - fresh! naturally!  made right there from the hands of the brilliant chefs.   
Tiramisù , Cheesecake, dolce tutti.   One can only make love to the pastry dish.    
Grazie tantissimo Sergio , Gianmarco , E tutti."}
{"text":"Love this Italian hot spot. Service is great and food is delicious. I usually always get the chicken piccata for lunch and love it. Tried some other specials and haven't been let down. Friday nights they have live music and place is hopping."}
{"text":"First off, service was on point.  Food was exceptional and wine list was broad for a smaller establishment.  We had beef carpaccio, seafood risotto with lobster, mussels, clams, scallops.   Risotto was perfectly cooked.  The hidden gem was the side of brussel sprouts though.   Really really good.  Dessert was a rich chocolate mousse cake.  Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"OMG our first time here for my birthday and we had the most amazing experience! The food the service everything was perfect! Happy birthday to me! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As usual our dining experience was top notch from the service to the upbeat atmosphere and of course the food was absolutely delicious. We had the appetizer special which had polenta in it and sausage. It reminded me of a crochet. We both had salads and we shared the chicken fettuccini Alfredo. We were accommodated with a side of broccoli steamed to perfection. My husband and I shared some wine.  We were treated to some lemonchielo after dinner chilled cocktails for my birthday ;) Yummy! This was and always is a great dining experience ."}
{"text":"Best server is Marco! Super nice and polite, service is wonderful here! Birthday celebration with 12 people, staff was amazing. Super attentive and made sure we were all satisfied! Beautiful new location at the district!"}
{"text":"Bella Vita is certain to become a neighborhood institution. Been open for awhile now and the experience has only improved with time. The excellent food comfortable seating, outdoor patio, indoor/outdoor bar and exceptional service combined with reasonable prices make this one of the best Italian restaurants in The Las Vegas / Henderson valley. Live music outside in the patio Weds through Sat night.  Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"My daughter brought me here for my birthday. Sergio introduced himself to us and introduced us to David who was to be our waiter. The entire experience was just wonderful. The food was spectacular and David was very attentive to our needs. We had the seafood risotto and we are still talking about how flavorful it was to all our friends. We will be coming here on a more regular basis. This is a fantastic addition to the District.
Thanks again for making my day so special."}
{"text":"Took my fiancee out for valentines dinner! we liked the atmosphere inside the restaurant was very busy we didn't had to wait much to get seated. We order the calamari plate with was good but very little portion. Main dish we got filet mignon with sparagous mash potatoes and sausage, again it was good but not to much of a portion. Overall I wanted to a 3.5 star review but 4 is good for the kindness of the people that took care of us that day!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant, the best Italian restaurant we ever been,the food we're delicious every time we come,  our favorite is the seafood risotto, you can taste the flavor of lobster,the clams and shrimps was really tasteful, I also love their tiramisu and canolli ,the staff are amazing, very friendly specially the manager Nicola ,me and my bf love him, he always come to our table to ask if everything is okay,I noticed also he goes to every table ,very good customer service I will recommend this restaurant if you want a real good  Italian food and friendly staff, and clean beautiful environment ,this is the one"}
{"text":"Decided to go to Bella Vita for dinner last night.  Walked in and asked the hostess if there was availability for three on the patio. She told us she would have a table for us in about 45 minutes. Gave her my cell and she said they would call when the table was ready.  I got the call exactly 45 minutes later. Good so far right?? Got to the restaurant (we were next door shopping while we waited for our table). She proceeds to inform us that we \"could only have the table for an hour because there's a reservation later\".... wait what??? How in the world do you tell me you can get us in and then tell me we have to leave in an hour so you can accommodate someone else??? Why in the world would I sit down and give you my money so you can kick me out an hour later.  So disappointed. We live near the district and have eaten at Bella Vita several times.  No more. I can take my business elsewhere and not be rushed to get out..."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this restaurant, wow truly impressed, loved the live music and the service was great especially from our waiter. Something new and refreshing. Food was amaizing, I had the Penne ala Vodka and my husband had Lobster Ravioli. I would suggest a reservation before going, it was very  full when I was there. See you again soon."}
{"text":"This is the perfect restaurant. Wither it's for a glass of wine, and appetizer, or all out dinner, this place hits the spot every time. Good prices. Very friendly. And you can't beat the setting. Anyone traveling to Goodyear needs to try this place. You'll feel like you're in Sedona!"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant in Montreal! I ordered a soup and a salad. The salad was not fresh, the grilled chicken was frozen. The waiter brought a soup that I did not order, when I asked about it he told me that the mushroom soup was gone. He said that they were with less staff than necessary for the day and he did not know the availability of the meals in the kitchen. Also, the menu was not updated. Don't waste your time here!!!"}
{"text":"Have gone here for happy hour and I love the patio as well as their menu selection. Service was great and while they didn't have a ton of allergy friendly options, even for the happy hour menu I was able to get the vegetarian salad which came without cheese naturally I believe. They did know that the salad dressing had gluten so I just asked them to bring it without and then that I would just use olive oil and vinegar.

I haven't read their regular menu but pretty sure everything they have is great and my family had the vodka pasta and arrabiata the spicy one and there was no leftovers everyone finished everything they ordered."}
{"text":"Nice experience. Reasonably priced happy hour food and wine. Great salads- the spinach salad is light with the right mix of seasoned ham slices. Flat bread looks tasty and light. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is unique on so many levels, firstly the manager is actively involved in every aspect of the experience. Moreover, the food is excellent, scratch made and served a the perfect temp. The food is presented  very well ( see pictures) but most importantly it  is simply delicious. As a side note - it's rare that I score any one place 5 stars but this place earned every star. 

Well I returned once again, and the food was just as good as I remember it- interestingly one new development. As the food came out I found myself enjoying the smell of the pasta as much as the taste. It's something that we sometimes forget but it's still significant - how often do you enjoy the aroma of fine food.... think about?"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the service. It took an hour to get the meal. To top it off it was not memorable.  Outdoor seating is nice when the weather is comfortable but that doesn't make up for the overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Hallelujah, finally Italy has surfaced in Henderson!
We have been going to Bella Vita since it opened and have never been disappointed.  From the Bella Vita Salad to the gnocchi, this restaurant tastes like the motherland.
Besides the food,  the staff is welcoming, warm and eager to please.
As frequent patrons, we have been able to get to know Sergio.  That thick Italian accent and his love of his restaurant makes this one of our favorite spots to frequent."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I haven't actually been there physically.  My roommate picked up two pizzas last night and brought them home.  Amazing!  Possibly the best pizza Ive had in Vegas.  And such a convenient location.  The two pre-selected ingredient combinations were tasty.  One with artichokes and the other with olives.  Both veggie."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome and wait staff is fantastic. Welcome addition to the Estrella Mountain neighborhood. The owner is EXTREMELY involved and responsive to the community. Definitely will support this local business."}
{"text":". have just returned to town after being away for the summer.. 
.. went to Bella Vita and was greeted like returning family..
.. besides having some of the best food in the valley.. (happy hours are killer)..
.. staff & service are as good as it gets.. 
.. never pass this one up.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted a nice dinner out on Friday to start our holiday shopping weekend off right. Unfortunately, after eating at Belle Vita he is still recovering from food poisoning this Sunday morning. Classic food poisoning started a few hours after we got home from dinner. The only thing we didn't share was his chicken marsala. Bad chicken? Mushrooms? I called the restaurant to let them know yesterday, and was told there wasn't a manager or anyone I could speak to. I hope the hostess who answered the phone passed the info to the cooks and no one else had their weekend ruined. It just goes to show you, even if a place is trendy, busy, and in a good location doesn't mean they necessarily have safe food handling procedures. Sorry Belle Vita, foodies, families, and friends, stay away from this place unless you're looking to lose 10 pounds before Christmas."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and great food. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The live music was good but not overpowering."}
{"text":"The food is horrible!! I gave my Veal to my dog!! The little weird host guy acts way stuck up.. This is far from Italian food.."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, over priced for portion size, limited gluten free options.service mediocre."}
{"text":"Did another Ladies Group Happy Hour and again, we were very impressed!  The service was the best, all the way from our reservation to the nite we were there.
Had 25 ladies on the patio for Happy Hour, servers were wonderful, food was delicious (as always) and the weather (which I think they asked for :)) was perfect!
A really nice location and great restaurant for all occasions!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant now. Great food and great service. The manager came over and asked us if we were happy with our meal. Everything we ordered was perfect."}
{"text":"AWESOME food high quality and very flavorful!! Located in the beautiful district at Green Valley Ranch where there is plenty of things to do before or after dining at Bella Vita. Sergio is the host there and is very friendly and on the spot also attentive with each table that is being served."}
{"text":"Overall a good experience.  The server grew on us but initially he seemed a little put out by doing his job.  As the meal continued, he seemed to straighten up a bit, I don't know if that is because I checked in on Yelp;  because he knew I was looking at Yelp for advice; or he just had a change of attitude.  The only bad thing about this is...this is what foreshadowed my experience.   I remember the meal, but I particularly remember the service...and it shouldn't be that way. 
   When we arrived, we were seated on the patio.  I like the patio, BUT the misting fans were distracting because they were not maintained, so they leaked large drops of water instead of mist, and that then would get blown onto us and our table.  So, we asked to have the misting part shut off, so we were not getting sprayed with water.  The issue here is that apparently, they are so broken that even when they shut the misting off, the fan in front of us had a stream of water spraying our still(For our entire meal), so they HAD to shut the fan off too or we would just have been sprayed the whole meal.   Then it became a little too warm to sit on the patio.  We didn't complain about it, we just tried to enjoy our meal, knowing at this point the misting was not fixable.
    Meal wise, we had a number of items, my mom had the chicken parm sandwich and said it was good, my older kids each had pasta al vodka and i tried this and it was good.   My younger kids split the margarita pizza and it was ok.  Crust was good.    My wife and I split two items, the Porchetta sandwich and a pizza with Prosciutto and greens.  I had them bring me Balsamic Glaze for the pizza and WITH that, it was good.  Without it, it was just bland and missing something.   The Porchetta sandwich was lacking IMO.  I am a huge Porchetta fan and this was just not Porchetta in my opinion.  It lacked all the seasoning and flavor of a good porchetta, and they put a roasted pepper on it, which I felt was just masking the lack of flavor in the porchetta with an overly strong peppers flavor.  So, I won't order that again.  I saw a number of things on the menu that I wanted to try, so I will probably try here again, but what I had didn't live up to expectations.

Last observation...LOVE the idea of tables on the patio with padded seating, BUT...the table prevented you from being able to put your legs under the table, so you just can't sit close enough to the table to the point where it is uncomfortable to sit there.  I wanted to be able to lounge back in the \"couch\" but then slide up to sit at the table and eat and i pretty much had to sit back the whole time and even take my food off the table to sit and eat."}
{"text":"Food was great! The Sea Food risotto was to die for.  The Bella Vita is truly the \"beautiful life\" at the District in Henderson. The service is great! Especially when David is taking care of your table."}
{"text":"I've been a couple times, both lunch and dinner. I hope to eat at Bella Vita many more times. The food is great and the staff is attentive and really cares that you have a great meal. They offer tastes of the wines if you're not sure what to order and couldn't be nicer about it. The pastas I've had have all been cooked perfectly and the standout was prepared with cured pork cheeks, loved it. The caesar salad is excellent. The frita mista perfectly cooked with a nice crunch but moist inside, think perfect tempura served with a spicy marinara. I recent tried a veal oso bucco and it was one of the best I've had, tender, juicy, well seasoned, perfect. It was served on a bed of risotto  that was delicious. Lobster ravioli was generous and tasty but I think the sauce was a bit too creamy but I'm splitting hairs here. The room is open and airy, very comfortable with a nice balance of casual but classy decor. From bread to dessert, everything I've had I'd gladly have again."}
{"text":"Bella Vita is truly an experience in the good life!  The Tagliatelle Bolognese was manifico!  The great service, live music and warm atmosphere all added to the wonderful evening."}
{"text":"Although I had heard negative reviews, I wanted to give this restaurant a try.   I was very disappointed.  We had reservations for 6:30 and we were seated at 6:50.   The server seemed as if he could not get away from from our table fast enough....not without completing our order.  
Our drink orders were incomplete. The \"beef steak\" tomatoe salad was simple Roma tomatoes.   The sausage ravioli was cold, bland and tasted like simple flour. The veal was tasteless. It was so noisy in the the restaurant we could could not exchange conversation. I could not wait to leave and will never return."}
{"text":"Not happy with the service.  The pellegrino was served on heavy glasses i asked for fine glasses.  Also the server saw me pouring my own pellegrino water.  When I completed my meal the waiter had the nerve to challenge my 10% tip.  He made me feel real uncomfortable and i will never come back to this place again or recommend.  Just not cool what the waiter did to me.  I should have hone back to speak to the manager."}
{"text":"Delicious pasta bosciola, very fresh.  Chicken dish was good and salad was fresh.  Nice ambiance on sidewalk patio area at the district in green valley ranch.  Service was a little slow, but we had an Italian waiter which added to the experience.  Overall very pleased with value."}
{"text":"This place has a great patio! Very comfortable seating and two tv's, so you watch the game. Go VGK! So far I've only been once, but I sure I'll be back to try more stuff. I ordered the Primo Amore pizza and it was vey good. Actually scratch that just thinking about it mashed me wavy it again! Tomato, arugula, cherry tomatoes, parmigiano, and burrata. Highly recommend. My friend ordered the margarita pizza but I was too into mine to try it. 

The stand out at this place is definitely service. Everyone from the hostess to the busser is extremely friendly and working to make your experience as enjoyable as possible. Definitely a great date night spot.

Also, try the cucumber vodka drink. I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian food run by a local Italian (Sicilian) family. The pasta is hand made daily, and the specials are excellent. My favorite is the bolagnese sauce on gnocchi or on tagliatelle."}
{"text":"Great appetizer, burata. Dinner was ok, Salmon and chicken piccata. Great limoncello after dinner drinks. Great server, Jon Marco!"}
{"text":"Had very high hopes but the food was mediocre and service was bad. Had the zucca and chicken ravoli and was very oily. Our waiter and busser came over to ask if we wanted dessert before we had our entrees. Took about 20 mins between appetizer and entree."}
{"text":"Very good new spot in the district at green valley. The ambiance is what made it for me. They have an indoor/outdoor bar that is a very cool feature (at least maybe until the vegas summers arrive). In the spring, the outdoor patio provides for great people watching and a little bit of a European feel. 

The service was great as well, and it seemed staffed with real Italians! Or at least they had me fooled. I hope the guy that set my plate down didnt judge be when I replied \"bueno\" to his \"como sta?\" And  \"gracias\" to his \"bon appetit\"... so sue me, I didnt brush up on my Italian first.

As for the food, I started with calamari: small portions here and nothing too special. For entree moved to  the linguine with clams, which was very good. Came with clams in shell which also confirmed they didn't get them from a can whixh  is always nice (but certainly to be expected if you are paying $21 for it). All in all a good sauce, good amount but nothing fancy.

Overall a memorable meal, if a little overpriced for what it is. A OK food and a nice ambiance and great service makes it a 4 star for me."}
{"text":"Two stars for the prime location.  Unfortunately the food was a disaster.

Marguerite pizza was a frozen cheese pizza with a few sprinklings of dried Italian seasoning.  No joke.

Husband made a comment to the server about the poor quality of the pizza when he inquired (and mind you my husband never complains about food even if it is horrible) and the server responded with something along the lines of the pizza being fresh, no basil of tomatoes on top because patrons complained about it so they've responded with not putting anything on the pizza, except for a few sprinkles of what seemed to be Italian seasoning...not even the gourmet kind, but the cheap Costco kind purchased in bulk.  No fresh mozerella, nada.  

Tuna salad was canned tuna dumped on top of cafeteria greens...

Sorry guys, gotta get the food up to par...."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Italian food in Nevada. Very nicely priced for what you get. Service always on fleek. One of my parents favorite places to have dinner with friends, to take a break from my sister and I."}
{"text":"Have been two times to this place- once for dinner with my husband, and another was happy hour with friends.  Both times, I really enjoyed myself.  
My server was Carlo both times, and he was attentive and awesome.  He told us the place was like a family, and as we looked around, we saw the staff working as a team and helping each other.  I like that about any place- but the food and cocktails in this place put it above the other restaurants around this area of town.  
Some suggestions:  The meatballs, the salmon, the sangria...I haven't had anything bad.  Its the perfect time of year right now to gather some friends and sit out on the patio for happy hour."}
{"text":"The wait staff is so friendly. Scott is def my favorite! Food and ambiance are amazing as we"}
{"text":"Being a native in Las Vegas, it is extremely hard to impress a foodie. My first impression was very welcoming. My friend and I ordered a few dishes and were very impressed. The waiter was extremely knowledgable in explaining the menu and what they had to offer. Great suggestions and wonderful taste! We later discovered their happy hour. 7 days a week 3-6 7$ deals and 5$ wines, can't beat it! New favorite place!"}

My girlfriend and I went for happy hour and still spent over 70 bucks. If you check in, you get 20% off. 
We had a good time and the service was great. Our server was Courtney, very friendly. (Keep up the good work)
We had the pizza. Misto and Caprese. Add a few drinks and their signature tiramisu and you will have yourself a nice time with your date.  
I suggest going in the evening hours, the lights really set the mood. 
BTW they had live soothing music. It is a very nice touch to the atmosphere. 
ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Classy environment.  Amazing drinks and the best Italian food off of the strip.  The prices were surprisingly available.  I highly recommend trying the pork chop; it is huge and delicious!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. Drinks are good and the bread is amazing. It came out warm straight out of the oven. The drink Bella beach is amazing, very tropical and refreshing. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with good prices. Try to sit in the back by the window. My family had the Pizza Quebecoise, Spaghetti Bolognese, Spaghetti Carbonara, and Steak Frites. Everything was delicious except the Bolognese, which was a bit dry and bland. The waiters could have been nicer but they were satisfactorily polite, albeit curt, which explains the 4-star rating."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great location , employees are friendly  & accommodating. Their Happy hour is awesome.Great selections for $7.00 ec.Outdoor seating too, with live music. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was a nice little treat for Italian food for a change from our usual Asian food...always nice with my baby...#foodiepartner #welovefood #baba"}
{"text":"Made reservations to sit on the patio.  When I arrived, the hostess told me they did not accept reservations on the patio.  I noticed that half the tables were empty so I inquired about sitting there.  She said they were reserved.  But, \"you said that you didn't take reservations on the patio\"  \"Well, those are reserved\".  I should have left at that point.  I waited at the bar and had a happy hour scotch on the rocks.  It was the smallest pour I have ever received (basically flavored ice).  My group was finally seated (at a table that had been empty the whole time).  We ordered the calamari appetizer off the happy hour menu.  It amounted to approx. 5 pieces of calamari that looked like it was left over from the previous customers.  I told the waiter it was unacceptable and he apologized and offered me a larger portion off the regular menu.  When he brought it back (in approx. 30 seconds), it was clear they had put the same portion on a bigger plate!..I ordered the lasagna which looked really good when it arrived.  The only problem was, they forgot to cook it!  When I say it was cold I am not exaggerating.  It was straight from the fridge.  Again, I sent it back and when it returned it was barely warm.  Again, more apologies.  At this point I knew it was a lost cause.  Basically, it's a pretty restaurant with nice service.  Other than that the kitchen is a disaster, the food is mediocre, the hostess is clueless."}
{"text":"Wanted to take a client out for a drink. Made it in for happy hour. We sat outside. Rather then ordering dinner we had apps. The Meatballs were amazing. The calamari was scant with basic marinara. Very little on the plate. The caprese was OK. Would have preferred a flatter cut of the mozzarella. The staff was great. I will be back,"}
{"text":"Outstanding atmosphere!  Authentic Italian cuisine that was outstanding.  They have a great patio with a bar that's great when the weather is good.  The employees are all friendly and attentive.  The drinks were great, the food was great, prices are very fair, and the service was outstanding!  I strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been to Bella Vita several times and have always had a good experience, not today. Food was good but the service was not up to par. The restaurant was not crowded but it took a half hour to get an order of pasta, a salad, and a panini. They had very strong candles lit all over the restaurant which is unusual to have a perfume scent in an eating establishment. I did catch a scent or sewer gas upon entering so maybe the candles were covering that up. No Candles in a restaurant please."}
{"text":"I'm mixed on this review.

We were quickly seated inside on a Saturday night (45 minute wait for outside seating). Hostess was courteous and kind.

We ordered the Beef Carpaccio as an appetizer and were served bread with oil and balsamic, as you might expect from an Italian restaurant. The bread was super fresh and tasty. The Beef Carrasco was a little bland, but with the arugula and Parmesan cheese, it added quite a bit of flavor.

I ordered the Chicken Marsala and the wife ordered the Apple & Pear Salad. My Chicken Marsala had a pretty good taste to it and so did the salad. Mashed potatoes with the Chicken dish were fluffy, but needed a little more flavor and the veggies were tasty.

Service was excellent, although it took us a bit of work to get the check at the end of the meal. They offered to allow us to use the current Yelp coupon, even though they usually only honor it during the week (as stayed on the digital coupon), so that was nice!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is super charming, but let's just say the menu and service don't match up.  My friend and I just had lunch there for the second time and we were less than impressed with our service. Our server was very inattentive and we had to ask for everything; drinks, refills, bread, the bills, etc.  When we thought to make a few suggestions to the manager, we learned that the manager was, in fact, our inattentive server......enough said :/"}
{"text":"I love Italian....

I do not love Bella Vita yet. I wanted to, though.

Other reviews had me excited, especially about the tiramisu, but something was definitely missing here. Service was indeed great. That was probably the best part. Food and drink offerings, just meh.

As we walked up, there was live music on the patio, but the little band was playing \"Macarena\". Weird. lol

I dined with a certified sommelier who of course wanted to order a nice bottle of wine. We were informed that the sparkling rosé only came in twist-top splits. Fair enough, I guess. Let's just say I've had way better from the bottom shelf at WalMart.

The warm bread was nice and fresh, but I wish they'd mix the oil and balsamic in a shallower dish/plate, because I kept getting just oil & ruining the lovely bread. *sad face*

I ordered the chicken ravioli. Kinda mushy and lacking in flavor. I think the pesto sauce was a little too creamy, drowning out everything else. My date had the gnocchi bolognese. Looked pretty good, but he said it was just okay.

Now for the main event: Tiramisu!!! I absolutely love tiramisu, so I had to try. It finally got to the table and looked delicious. So pretty and promising...Then first bite. Just okay (running theme here). Very heavy on the custard and not enough alcohol/espresso/ladyfinger lavishness. A much lighter version than what I'm used to.

Bae ordered the creamy limoncello, which was interesting, as neither of us had ever had a creamy version, so we wouldn't know what to compare it to.

At the end of the day, I'd probably come back for happy hour to try the blood orange cocktail, but no rush."}
{"text":"Cons--needs more fans or close doors and use AC.   Very noisy.   Not much of a beer selection
Pros--decent food taste and serving size. Decent service."}
{"text":"Ill Start with the fact that we came in vacation in las vegas, we made a reservation for 9:30pm, like an hour and a half ago, we drove like 20 minutes to get here and whenever we got here( ill be honest we were 5 
Min late )wich in every single business is not a big deal if you wanna keep your stars up , the front desk girl said she can't take us cause they close at 9pm when on the yelp and maps and everywhere else says 10pm, first of all you guys were supposed to change these hours before you start closing at 9pm, when i walked in the place it looked pretty empty, which means local people know that and they don't really make a reservation, what happens when they just walk in and you're turning them away just because you changed the hours ? Second- why would you give a reservation at 930pm and make me drive from who knows were if you already know that you're closing at 9pm, that doesn't make any sense... she was smiling in our faces keep on saying sorry for that, like really? I wouldn't give this place not even 0 if that was possible..... there is hundreds places around you where I could go but I choose your place ... and i left disappointed... i will never come back"}
{"text":"6 of us had a wonderful birthday meal here last night. To start, the food was simply amazing. High quality and delicious! The service was impeccable. So kind and attentive! It was a busy Friday night and we never felt rushed at all. The prices weren't on the cheap side, so this is the place to go for a special occasion, but man is it worth it! I want to try them for lunch next."}
{"text":"Great Italian food.  Nice time to go is Happy Hour when all the dishes are a great deal.  Service is excellent.  The food is delicious and came out quickly after ordering.

Cons:  the music is really loud and hard to hear each other talk."}
{"text":"This place is permanently closed.  Has been replaced with Casa del Mar Pizza.... go check them out!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Italian restaurant in The District.  It was jammed Saturday night.  Nonetheless the service was spot on, the food was delicious and served piping hot at just the right time.  The Managers were checking everything and making sure everyone was happy.  It really makes a difference when the owners are there every night.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We began going to this restaurant shortly after it opened and have now been there at least a dozen times. We are pleased to see it just keeps getting better and better as they get another month under their belt. This weekend we introduced new friends to it. They have traveled and dined all over the world including Italy. They loved it. The branzino, calamari, chicken dishes and pasta bolognese were superb. Salads are fresh and so large we shared. Cannoli's were a big hit as well. Staff is friendly and the owner is committed to making this a great experience for guests. As locals we love it and will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing place. This place is very respectful knowledgeable and knows what they are serving"}
{"text":"We love the food, atmosphere, local hangout, bring your favorite wine (corkage fee). Great waiter Carlo from FHHS"}
{"text":"Great service! Everyone is so friendly and cater to your culinary desires. I had the breaded veal and seasonal vegetables. My husband had the bolognese pasta. Full wine list. Indoor or outside seating. Fun bar area."}
{"text":"First time here and my last, Not impressed.  Went with three of my girlfriends. Was our first time for all of us. We sat down on the patio. Oil was served, but no bread, well at least not until asking for it on two different occasions 30 minutes later! We ordered a bottle of champagne, and had to serve our own... can we get a forth glass??? There is four at the table not three... arggg...Our server was not very good at all. Our food finally came....Over an hour and 20 minutes later from our 6:15 reservation. 
Waiter recommended the salmon over my Italian selections.... Salmon at a 'Italian' restaurant, OK (?) and it was just that... just 'Ok' nothing special. Can we get some pepper? Had to ask 2 times (again) can we get some lemon for water? Asking again 2 times... would you  please remove these bread plates as we needed the room... nothing done. I moved them myself to a table close by. Well there you have it. Not going back.... No reason to return...."}
{"text":"Although I thought it might possibly deserve a 2-star, my two comrades did not agree. The pizza I had was definitely bearable. Not that well cooked but tasty enough. I had the québécois pizza. Cooked well on the bottom, veggies and toppings on top were still room temperature. 

One friend got the pasta al pesto. It was green and tepid. 
One friend got the penne arabitta. Very spicy, but no taste. Just spice. Might as well have drank a bottle of franks red hot. 
One friend ordered 2 menu items. This was too hard for the kitchen. They settled on sending is one of them, and pretending like the other was not ordered. 

Server had sass. Portions were too small and expensive. Beer was cold though so that's a plus, right? Tourist trap for sure."}
{"text":"Showed our server this promo offer from their own FB page but mgr claimed it was only for Mon-Thurs but it clearly states \"this weekend\". Ended up ordering the chicken Marsala which had the oddest texture I've ever had. Some soft and other parts rubbery, couldn't eat it. Our server was very nice, and took it off the tab. Check pricing on wine here, my glass was $20, bottled water $8. I'm not picky and I've eaten here once before with no issues but this was beyond disappointing."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the happy hour menu is awesome!  For $7 per plate you get a lot of food.  Happy hour is only at the bar which consists of only 15-20 seats so get there early!  Service is great, they even have live music at sunset."}
{"text":"The Heirloom Tomato & Beets Salad is great! Love the ambiance & food! 

They also have live music Thursday- Sunday 6:30pm-9:30pm- great addition to The District!"}
{"text":"Took the family there for a special dinner.  After a rocky start it turned into a great evening.  Scared to order too much like we do at other Italian restaurants, we decided to order three entrees for the four of us.  It was perfect.  Pastas weren't heavy and the sauces were amazing.  We will be back for sure.  Best Italian place we've found in green Valley."}
{"text":"We went here for happy hour. I was seated on the patio and asked was told Happy hour is usually only at the bar, but might be able to get it. There are only 12 seats at the bar, so that would unfair to everyone else trying to get drink when every other bar in the district and gvr service more than 12 people. After waiting 15 minutes we were only acknowledged by the busser who did not know if we could get happy hour. So, we left since no one could help us and went to the new place, Borracha that serves happy hour in the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"Well this is my first time here and not impressed at all. They have a happy hour but if you are seated inside you don't get a menu unless you know to ask. It is very noisy in here also. The food was good."}
{"text":"Took my little sister here the other night for dinner.. I have been here once before and absolutely loved it and thought it would be a good time to try it again. She ordered the veal piccata and I had ordered the seafood risotto which was a special for the night. 
Let me start off by saying that the service was phenomenal really good all-around
But she didn't really like her veal which I understand was something new for her I really liked it but she just kind of powered through it and ate it because I was paying for dinner and she wanted to be polite. 
My meal was a seafood risotto. The small shell fish was cooked fine and the risotto is cooked beautifully,.. however the lobster was not ok. I was really disappointed that the lobster was complete rubber on top of the food. I didn't even eat the lobster. I tried cutting through it and it just wasn't working so I just dumped it in the empty plate that they had where I was supposed to put the shells from the mussels and scallops. 
The atmosphere was great...but if you have an introvert in your group like I did don't bring them here because it's going to be a little too loud for them. Next time I'm going to take her to Bottiglia and see if she likes that better."}
{"text":"Meh. Best thing about this place was the price point compared to the Strip. Husband and I came here after touring the GVR area. I wanted to go to the other pizza place across the street, but he convinced me it was a long walk and we should try this place. The ambiance is nice. Place was pretty empty, but it was off hours on a Thursday, so understandable. Ordered the Zingara pizza with salami, onions, red peppers. It was seriously lacking in the red pepper department...I think I saw 2 on the whole pie. It was also DRIPPING with oil, literally. I held up each slice to drain the oil off the top before I ate it. Ew. 

Husband had the spaghetti and meatballs...meatballs were an extra $7! Sauce was watery and I didn't think it was anything special. So much for a $22 dish. 

My pizza was only $12 I think for lunch, so that was a decent deal. It was overall fine, but not anywhere we'd come back to. 

They do have HH 3-6pm I believe, and a nice outdoor patio area. Maybe that would have been the way to go?"}
{"text":"This place has perfect location but that is about all they have going for them. I ordered a lobster pasta. It looked beautiful. After taking a huge bite, I realized the lobster was RAW! It was almost completely raw. I told the waiter. He took it back to the chef finished cooking my bitten lobster. The waiter returned with the exact lobster. The manager did NOTHING. She didn't offer a new lobster. She didn't offer to remove anything from the bill. She didn't even offer dessert. The food was not good. My family of 5 all had different dishes. None of the dishes were considered delicious by any members of our family."}
{"text":"The service was mmmm okay !!!! My friend and I went there for our lunch time ordered a very simple Caesars salad  
Not good at all 
FYI chicken breast was dried and over cooked  the lettuce looked soggy 
IHOP Caesars salad is much better 
And this cost $32.50  total 
It was our first time there and our last time there 
So we went to panera right next store instead... Much better"}
{"text":"This is not authentic Italian! It's expensive for food I could cook at home. We had a $100 gift certificate from Christmas. We had to use it all the wouldn't give us another for the difference. Use it or lose it they said. My salmon had shrimp from a can on it. The server was horrible, 'like whatever' I felt like he was thinking. The noise was so bad you couldn't have a conversation. Never going back. Hope it doesn't last and get something good in its place. As it is walking distance from our house."}
{"text":"My expectations and my experiences have always been great at this location.  We came here when it first opened and the service and food was and is delicious!  The grilled octopus is so delicious and David our server was very attentive.  We had the seafood risotto, it was well seasoned.
We're definitely going to keep coming back..
Love the environment and surroundings!"}
{"text":"Service is friendly, but the food is awful. The pizza was ok. The chicken scallopini was salty, the fettuccini was not \"homemade\" as they claimed. It was also salty. The brussels sprouts were mediocre, the mushrooms were salty. The bread was the not edible, but at least that was free. For the price, go to Vintner Grill and get a guaranteed amazing meal."}
{"text":"The food was average Italian, good but not excellent. This place, is great for the ambiance around Old Montreal, especially outside when it's warm enough. 

We found that the service was good and because of our waiter, Amen, we had an even more pleasurable evening here at la Bella Vita, which is why the rating gets bumped up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"I went there last Friday arriving at 5:15 for happy hour.  We were told that happy hour is till 5:30.  I said I thought it was till 6, the hostess replied not on Friday.  Of curse it wasn't 5:30 yet.  We ate off the regular menu.  I was not impressed, in my opinion there are better Italian restaurants in the area. Upon returning home I checked their website again  It clearly states happy hour 3-6 daily.  I emailed them, but of course didn't get a response.  I'll spend my money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very nice place to have lunch on a weekend. Just found this restaurant and service was exceptional! Good drinks too!"}
{"text":"Love Bella Vita. Classy and cool. People watching on patio, enjoying sangria tonight and some mini gourmet pizza. Nothing better in this weather. Great staff. Marco is the best."}
{"text":"Beautiful outdoor patio with live music 
Full bar
Great location

my favorite time to attend Bella vita is during happy hour before the night crowd arrives. 

Their $7 happy hour plates are very generous portions and are enough to fill me up. 

My favorite dishes here are the gnocchi and tagliatelle Bolognese. 

I recommend making a reservation for evenings as this place can get very packed."}
{"text":"I do like this place.  My first experience was great!!  Second experience, not so great.  First time we had a lovely waiter who was super attentive.  My kids always want to come here now.  Our second experience was Mother's Day weekend.  We were a party of 10, 6pm reservation.  To our lovely (not) surprise there was a limited menu.  Super disappointing because we were not told that when we made our reservation, and if we had known this we probably wouldn't have come here (could've gone to Pizza Rock). They didn't even have meatballs or lasagna. Why a limited menu anyways- all the restaurants around this area are larger and just as busy and they don't limit their menu? 

Our waiter had this certain heir about him, like he couldn't be bothered with us.  He left us for over 10 minutes to look at the menu, all the time I just watched him socialize and look at the hockey game.  Eventually I had to ask one of the ladies bringing our bread \"where is our waiter\"?  Then he just seemed annoyed when we didn't know the menu- nothing had descriptions like the normal menu does.  At one point my mom had asked him for a refill, when he brought it back he looked right at my brothers empty soda glass and just walked away- like let me get out of here as fast as I can before he asks for a refill.  The rest of the staff was friendly!!  

My husband and I decided to share chicken parmesan w/pasta, a salad and a side of green beans because I get full quick (eating all the yummy bread) and I'd rather not take home a ton of leftovers.  Chicken parmesan was $27.  Ok, fine with me, but the portion size was laughable.  It was literally no more then 4oz of chicken breast pounded out thin. When they brought our food out we thought the waiter had separated ours out on 2 plates because he knew we were sharing. It was that small that this would've been totally believable.  Turns out that second plate was my brothers order.  My husband and I literally laughed out loud. I don't know if they raised their prices for this weekend? But it was way overpriced- I paid $5 more for a larger and more delicious chicken dish at Olives @ Bellagio.  My father ordered sausage ravioli and said he couldn't even taste sausage.  We also had dessert.  I love Tiramisu and I really enjoyed the one here.  I'm pretty easy to please when it come to Tiramisu though.  I pray for you if your waiter's name rhymes with Larry, Harry, or Gary.  We will most likely return because we live close by.  I generally don't eat a lot of carbs and I love eating salads and meatballs.  My kids also like their kids menu.  My husband never wants to return.  If it wasn't for the limited menu and our snooty waiter, I know our experience would have be a lot better."}
{"text":"I've read favorable reviews and heard this was a romantic Italian restaurant, so we gave it a try. The loud, bright, open air seating wasn't what we expected, but were still game to try some good food. 

Upon checking in, I informed the host we had 5:15pm reservations. They didn't bother checking and just seated us. I later got an email that they canceled our reservations, for not showing up? 

My date ordered a nice Pinot. The waiter stated another wine was much much more popular and she should try it instead, which she did. I ordered a house Chianti. He stated in that case I should try the 'house' favorite. Little did I know the waiter upsold us to double the price of what we'd requested. He then pressured us to add appetizers. We declined...several times. 

I was hoping the food would be good, but was average at best. Pasta was dry and bland. I couldn't track the waiter down for more bread. But that didn't matter as my plate was taken away before I was finished eating. 

Upon paying, I used a coupon for a free entree. Instead of taking the lesser $18 entree off the bill, he deducted $9. Frustrated, we ended up leaving early. I wanted to rate this establishment high, but felt conned and candidly, an evening I'd like to forget."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Just when I was thinking I would need more water, the server appeared with a personal jug of water. Got the chicken pesto pizza. Crust was light and crispy. Pesto was on point."}
{"text":"Great spot!!!! Super friendly staff. Trendy, lively atmosphere with classic Italian food. Good wine list if you are looking to splurge a little. Try the meatballs, they're delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The best food in town!! Great customer service!! If you are in Vegas must go to Bella Vitas!! I will be back! We don't have this in L.A. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"So far we've only had a chance to try this place out for lunch, but we really enjoyed our lunch. 

The first time we tried to eat here was for dinner, but it turned out to be their opening weekend and they were completely full. Now that I've been inside I can see that the restaurant is pretty cozy so I imagine reservations will be necessary for weekend nights. 

Service was very attentive. Our server checked in regularly and another man was constantly refilling water and clearing plates. Our food came out without a long wait.

I had the Panino Romano (porchetta, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, and mozzarella). The Panini had a generous portion of the porchetta and the onion and red peppers were a good choice to pair with the porchetta. I liked the crispy Panini bread as well. This came with the option of fries or salad. I chose salad and really liked the dressing on the salad. 

My husband had the Zingara pizza. This also really good. It had a nice flavor and was a generous portion for lunch for one person. The salami on the pizza had a little bit of a spice to it and was very tasty. 

I had to get dessert once I heard the options. I was sold on the Italian Pana Cotta. Yum! I love their twist on this typical dessert. The pana Cotta was on pears that tasted like they were wine poached. On top there was whipped cream, cookie crumble, and basil. All of the flavors were great alone and worked well together. l.oved this dessert.

I can't wait to come back and enjoy a dinner here since that menu looks great as well."}
{"text":"Great happy hour & delicious food! I had the Penne a la Vodka. The Elderflower Bloom martini is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"What a great place. Love the atmosphere. The service is amazing and the food is impeccable"}
{"text":"I'm from Louisiana & staying at the Green Valley Ranch Resort & ventured out for a little shopping and stumbled upon this fun place and so glad we did! It just looked fun, had someone playing live music and when we walked in the owner, Sergo, was there and greeted us & was so nice and hospitable. There was a small wait & he was quick to get us a table and apologetic for the wait. We asked for his recommendations. I had the braised short rib special that wasn't on the menu that Sergo suggested & it was AMAZING. We also had the the seafood dish everyone loves and it was great and my other friends sausage ravioli was to die for as well! We ordered the tiramisu for dessert & Sergo treated us to it on the house!!  also talked to a lot of locals here who love this spot too. Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We like to support local restaurants and were excited to try this new place.  We were completely underwhelmed with all of the food, to include a pizza, a pasta dish, an appetizer,  and a salad.  The food was not awful, it just wasn't special or something like what a professional chef might make--I'm not a stellar cook and I could have fixed all of these dishes at home.   I should also mention, those items plus two drinks, cost $63 for lunch, not including tip.  

Our waiter, while nice, was terrible.  He would leave and not return for 10, 15 minutes.  He brought our food and was about to leave, we had to point out we needed refills on our drinks and silverware.  He did not know what was supposed to be in my salad when I asked. We had to track him down to get our bill, as he apparently started setting up new tables inside.  I'm not sure if it was short-attention-span-theater or what, as they appeared to have plenty of staff and only a few occupied tables.

A real let down on several fronts."}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly for the last year so a review is long overdue.
Let's start with the fact that this is located in the district in a primo location that offers happy hour specials and great food. 
The service is prompt and usually on point with casual Italian accents drifting through the restaurant bustle. Definitely make reservations for the weekend nights.

My fave is the 
Tagliatelle Bolognese - house made al dente pasta with a hearty, yet light meat sauce. 

My wife likes the
Linguini & Clams - house pasta with a light and savory brothy sauce that coats every noodle and a generous amount of fresh clams.

We've also tried the 
Zuca Ravioli -  it can be a hit or miss. When it's good, the browned butter sage sauce is as delicate as the butternut squash ravioli. When it's bad, the sauce looks watered down and sage is undercooked leaving an unpleasant taste.

Burrata - whether in the salad or anti pasta, it looks and tastes house-made fresh.

Penna Cotta - perfect consistency, not too firm. The accompanying wine poached pears are a unique treat.

Tiramisu - Perfect and can convert any non-tiramisu lovers.

It's one of our favorite spots that I hope will be around for a long time. 

Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after doing some holiday shopping. Had to wait more than 5 minutes for a table to be cleared and set....and there were plenty of empty tables. We ordered, and my boyfriend ordered the pork chop, and it was raw. He sent it back and they returned it to the table. Two more bites into it, and it was still raw. He called the waiter over. The server was apologetic and tried to get the manager who was too busy to look at the plate. The waiter did not offer another option or even to give us dessert. They did take the raw pork off the bill. As we walked to the car we felt we owed the owner the courtesy of letting him know that we were served raw pork twice. We went back in spoke to the hostess and waiter, but the owner was still too busy to address the concern. It is a shame as we like to frequent local places, but certainly won't be going back there."}
{"text":"I have been here on 5 occasions.  Every time the wait staff were incredibly slow.I like the bruschetta,but it is overpriced. I would be more likely to come back (frequently) if the waitstaff were better."}
{"text":"Seafood risotto was superb. Meatballs were great. Excellent service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cute, quiet pizzeria in Old Montréal. We were walking around and lunch time arrived. Stopping in at Bella Vita didn't disappoint. We were greeted and seating upon entry and the staff was able to communicate with us in English (great since we are coming from south of the border). 

We ordered the chicken pesto (#17 I believe) and it was phenomenal. The olive oil drizzled on was a great twist and certainly new to me. I was very pleased with the quality and flavor, mainly due to the olive oil. 

I would certainly go back, and recommend Bella Vita to others. Soft drinks could be priced a little more reasonably but oh well."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant with great ambiance and a good selection of tasty food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. Very busy but great service. Didn't get a 5 star because we were disappointed in the wine selection and it was better to buy it but the glass not bottle. The wine they did have was over priced. Wish they had better price by the bottle. The food we had was very good. We did have the calamari and it was a little under cooked. We will be back."}
{"text":"Best food I have had in the district very accommodating!!! And they even did a special message for my grandmothers 75th birthday on her bottle of champagne!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our third time at Bella Vita was not as good in service or quality of food as our first two times. Our bartender was not very skilled in making cocktails and gave me a drink I didnt actually order. The antipasto misto was still good. Also had the caesar salad which was pretty good. The Panna cotta though..  So disappointing. It was nothing like our first experience with it. This time is came on a plate and it was a layer of a weird raspberry gelatin, Panna cotta and then a raspberry glaze. It all tasted so fake and weird. The raspberry gelatin was not good at all. 

Overall, it feels like the first time we went, Bella Vita was new and they were trying really hard to have great service, food and presentation. But, now its almost like they've realized they'll get steady traffic even without trying hard. It's all fine but nothing like I experienced before."}
{"text":"Nice little Italian restaurant in the district @GVR.. Nice selection of wines at the bar. The two-man band very enjoyable! 
Food was good and reasonably priced.."}
{"text":"We had reservations for 7:00pm at this place and we were waiting until 8:00pm and we had to leave. Do not go here

UPDATE: Went Back and the same thing happened again"}
{"text":"Service 5 stars!!  Ambiance was 3.5 stars but we sat inside so I imagine outside would have been better.  I ordered Chicken Marsala and it was good, husband ordered it go to lasagna and it had a good flavor but seemed like it had cream cheese or something like that in it.  It was actually too cheesy and not the melted kind of cheese, more like a soft cheese.  We had a salad that was mediocre and calamari for appetizer.. that was just ok..  Bread was good wine prices not horrible for a bottle.  I really enjoyed the service though so I think I'd try it again.."}
{"text":"I went there for our 25th wedding anniversary with my daughter and husband for the first time. The place was nice and people very nice and welcoming our server was very respectful and helpful. However it's not a place that you can take your date there it's wasn't a quite and relaxing dinner.  They had a life band outside but we chose to sit inside so we can talk, and we couldn't hear each other, it was so much noice from the kitchen and people that worked there.  Overall it was ok."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour places in Henderson! Excellent Italian food as well as a great beer and wine selection. A little pricey during non happy hour timeframes, but definitely worth it for a memorable date night. Bonus: the outdoor patio area is perfect during spring and fall!"}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews about this place. My fiance and I went here because it's a cute little spot in the district at green valley and we saw they had a lunch special for a good price. We asked to be seated outside because it has a nice little patio.  The hostess seated us right next to the exit gate where everyone comes in and out from. Also within 10 mins the band sets up right next to our table as well. And when I say next to I really me so close that I can reach out and touch his keyboard. The band kept apologizing to us for bumping into our table. Also the server that we had was pretty awful. He never checked in on us to refill our drinks and only came to give us our check. Now I will give this place a 3 star due to the food actually tasting pretty delicious and the nice design of the place. I hope that if I ever decide to come back that the service will be better"}
{"text":"Bella Vita has the best lasagna I've ever had.  
Each tender layer is a bite of magic. 
The luscious creaminess and rich meat filling is perfectly adorned with the most delicate tomato sauce. It is balanced, it is rich yet restrained, and I am completely obsessed."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for a date night. Keep in mind if you want to sit outside on a Friday night, you will need to have a little patience but it is well worth it. 

The manager bought my boyfriend and I a round of cocktails while we waited. Once we sat down we were engulfed by the scents and sounds of Bella Vita. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. We will definitely be returning to this neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't been to this place earlier given how often I pass by it. I would call it upscale casual Italian dining. The hosts are quick to welcome you and generally you do not need a reservation. Although I do recommend calling ahead if you do have a specific date/time in mind because the place can fill up quickly.

Food is traditional Italian fare and they execute it quite well. I recommend the fettuccine alfredo as it is creamy and rich as it's supposed to be. The pizza is classic Neapolitan style. Thin crust, robust Mariana sauce and slices of mozzarella for the topping. The calamari comes to a close second to the best of my calamari experiences. Not chewy, light battered crust and served with lemon. The antipasti is ok. Good to go with wine as it has sliced meats, cheeses and olives. 

Ambiance is intimate and would be a good place for a date. Pricing is just a tad high, but I think befitting considering the service is attentive and live music is available on weekends. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch . I had the meatball panini and sangria. Both are very good and the ambience of the restaurant was enjoyable . I look forward to coming back for live music and dinner ."}
{"text":"Amazing place I can't wait to take my family here to enjoy this experience the knnowledge is amazing and the service is on point"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Italian restaurant is Vegas right now. My family and I have been coming here for over a year now. Many special occasions have been had here. The manager is always accommodating, sweet, and inviting every time time we come. The food is also consistently fabulous!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service sucked.  I called a couple of days before to reserve a table for a birthday party event. At the beginning, everything seemed fine, we seemed to have waited a while to order, we continued to wait and still nothing. So when we ordered we still waited for a long time, I honestly don't mind waiting if it's something worth waiting for but when nobody tells you anything and your just there waiting? For example, ordered my kids juices at the same time all drinks ordered and when an hour passed and no kids juices,  we asked for them and they said that they must have been brought to the wrong table. Anyways, continued to wait and I kid you not, the kids drinks came 15 min after the food, and this was initiated with a comment from the waiter that they ran out and had to go borrow some apple juice from Lucille's. I mean why lie about the kids drinks in the first place, people need to speak up and communicate here and maybe people would nit be so upset. Again, the food was tasty especially the gnocchi and raviolis."}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is great!!!! The ambiance, live music , and food were incredible! 

Service - top notch! Never ran out of drinks nor bread and constantly asked if everything was good! *****

Food - Great food and very reasonable! Apps, Drinks, Salad, Soup and entrees! The dishes weren't to heavy and had very good flavor, portions were great and a great variety for anyone to enjoy something!!! 

Atmosphere - Fantastic!!!! 

You have to try this place out the location is great and it will definitely be the new favorite! Keep doing what you are doing one of the best places I have been to in a long time!"}
{"text":"Great food! We ordered their special of lobster, clams, mussels and scallops over creamy risotto. The serving was huge and the food rich and delish. Service was prompt with the most delightful of servers. Will definitely come back with family and friends."}
{"text":"Update since I got the name wrong my bad!!: the bartender who our whole party loved is called \"Melissa L.\"  She made the night very enjoyable and was very attentive to all of our requests. I said I wanted something fruity and a little sour with either vodka or rum, and she made me something very delicious off my terribly skimpy directions!! 

We were celebrating a friend's birthday, and she made us some very tasty shooters-stuff that I loved but I forgot the names for!! She's awesome, and I would be looking for her the next time I am in town at Bella Vita."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place for dinner based on reviews here. On the waiters suggestion, my husband and I each decided to try one of the specials. After waiting for quite awhile, the manager finally came over and let us know that what my husband had ordered was out. He offered two suggestions that were similar and my husband chose one. After what was a ridiculous wait for an empty restaurant, the food finally came. My husband said his food was delicious. Mine was a disaster. I had ordered the risotto  with chicken and asparagus. The chicken was so over cooked it was rubbery. The asparagus was just stem pieces that were over an inch and a half thick. They were woody and gross. The risotto was supposed to have a \"touch of pesto\" and my dish was swimming in a green soup. I'm guessing they were out of my special as well and just decided to scrape something together the best they could to not have to come over again. In fairness, they did take my meal off the bill. But the offered substitution for my husband's meal was almost TWICE THE PRICE of what he had originally ordered. At the end of the day, we paid more for one meal than what we would have for the two meals we ordered. I ended up having crackers for dinner because we couldn't find a place still open by the time we left.  Huge disappointment. If you have time and money to waste, it seems there's a chance you could have a good experience here. We, however, will not be giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"Disappointing! The sprite my kids ordered was flat, the calamari we ordered was such a skimpy order, I added shrimp to my pasta for an additional $7 charge and only got 4 pieces of shrimp, my glass of wine was skimpy, and the restrooms do not have potty protectors. You do not get your money's worth. I chose to give 3 stars because the taste of the food was good and had a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been multiple times and have never been disappointed! Pizza is great - the crust is fantastic! Portions are huge! Take the leftovers home :)"}
{"text":"We went here for a going away dinner for one of our staff.  I personally don't order italian food out, so trying Bella Vita was a great surprise.  Our meals were so delightful, I enjoyed every bit.  I ordered the Veal Marcella and I honestly will say I have never had this dish any better ever anywhere.  I had to take some home for my hubby to try is was so delicious.  We will definitely be back there and they have a wonderful outside service area.....can't wait."}
{"text":"This two star review is from both my aunt and I who were touring Old Town this week, got hungry and wanted to dine on Poutine. We happened to be standing in front of it on a Monday at
lunch so why not? It looks cute! 

And it is, very Italian. There is a Poutine menu, pizza, pasta and salads. The normal Italian type options. As I had never had Poutine before, I got that option with the smoked meat for 14.95$ and a Canada Dry. Service was fine although as the woman brought out drinks, I know she didn't want to give me to wi fi code when I asked. She looked shocked but gave it to me anyway. Ha! 

Apparently, this Poutine is not how the locals make it. The meat wasn't flavorful and the bits of cheese weren't gooey. Even my Canadian friends agree when I posted the picture online. My aunt apologized profusely all week but all good. A new experience in a lovely setting. There were carriages outside the windows and the Staff leaves you alone to dine as long as you want, European style. Go here for Italian food with an aesthetic setting and skip the Poutine!"}
{"text":"Honestly, one of the Best Italian Restaurants in Henderson! The bread is freshly made and the Pasta is Homemade.  Light and Fresh!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Bella Vita at the District! Their food is excellent and their friendly, attentive service is exceptional! 
We continue to return taking our family, friends and colleagues! It is especially nice in the evening dinning on their outside patio area listening to the live music! It is also a great place to network after work at their outdoor open bar!
We think of Bella Vita as our Cheers Bar!
Check it out! I am sure you will want to return again and again!"}
{"text":"I have tried to check this place out twice first time was to late they weren't taking reservations so went around the corner. Tried to go yesterday at 9p they said they were closed. Who closes at 9 p on a Friday???? We ended up going to Hanks at Green Valley Ranch it was wonderful!

Not sure if I will give it another try"}
{"text":"Service was quick, drinks were refreshing, food was delicious and staff was great! We had the kids pizza (generous portion), seafood risotto (a good special) and penne a la vodka (good but I like peas and mushrooms in this dish). Love the logo!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour! The happy hour is from 3-6pm in the bar and patio. This review is only based on the drinks since I did not order any of the food. 

I ordered two of their cocktails. The Arancia Rossa (Tito's handmade vodka, cointreau, fresh blood orange) and the Elderflower Bloom (Prairie cucumber vodka, elderflower liquor and prosecco). During happy hour the cocktails are $7. My favorite of the two was the Arancia Rossa because of its fruity flavor. 

I visited a Wednesday around 5:00pm and the place was already full. By the time I left (about 7:00pm) the restaurant was still very busy. I suggest making a reservation because there will be a wait time if you visit during this time."}
{"text":"Wanted to like it... but very disappointed. First of all, the service was slowwww. Waitress was nice enough but she didnt come around and didnt come back til the end. The bread was just plain disappointing. If you are going to offer bread, make it good- it's a sign to what is next. Had the soup- too salty. My husband's pasta was just ok too. We wanted to like it since it would be convenient to go there at the District after shopping or the movies, but it just didn't cut it for us."}
{"text":"What an nice experience ---the staff actually looked happy to be there. Relaxed atmosphere.
The food was really really good. We sat outside and watched a hockey game. What a beautiful setting .
We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"What a lucky find and during happy hour. We ordered a huge variety of small plates off the happy hour menu to try out their food. Oh my, it was sooooo good. Their homemade gnocchi in pesto sauce was my favorite, but the meatballs, penne in vodka sauce and shrimp scampi were close seconds. Happy hour also includes cocktails and they were also very good. The location was very convenient, in the District, and ambiance was lovely. Staff was super helpful and attentive so I will be back soon, probably during happy hour."}
{"text":"Cocktails are generous, as are food portions. Had the salmon, cooked perfectly. Our server Courtney was exceptional, she knew the menu and helped us both select our dinner."}
{"text":"First visit was wonderful. Second time not so muchSeafood risotto was just plain awful. Short rib special was good but everything else was just ok."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant. The staff here really take care of you and make sure you have everything you need. I love the open kitchen and they even had a pianist who played through dinner. Sergio, Ramiro and nicolai took care of us and are straight from the top draw (which in England means the best) thank you again for a wonderful evening"}
{"text":"Belittled and berated! The worst resturant experience I have ever had! 

The service was beyond atrocious! The waiter came by once to take our orders and then dropped off our meal and we never saw him again. There was only two other people in the resturant and they were not being served either.We had a party of 4 and two of us could not stomach our dishes. The lasagna was soupy and the four cheese pasta was over powering. When we finally found the waiter to get our bill we mentioned how we did not eat our meal and did not enjoy it. The waiter said we should have mentioned this before.

He then asked if we were locals and snickered when we said we were not. He then called out the chef who told me I didn't have a pallet, wasn't hungry to eat good food and if I hadn't eaten any he would not have made me pay?! Not certain why the waiter felt the need to bring the chef into this. He insulted me infront of the two other people in the resturant and despite me just trying to justify not wanting to take home the terrible food that was left in front of me, they personally insulted my table and myself. 

When we didn't tip the waiter then yelled at us. When we justified that we didn't receive service for the majority of our meal and then were treated to insults he said it didn't matter. 


My recommendation: New staff. 
Tourist trap, lack of professionalism was astounding."}
{"text":"took dinner there, food was very normal not tasty and the place inside hot without AC! I thought I will enjoy my meal but the clams pasta was a deception for me and plates are served in a small quantity"}
{"text":"Very good experience for lunch. Spaghetti was tasty. Very nice ambience - we sat outside on patio. Great service. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service so far so great ! The surrounding is aesthetic & I LOVE THEIR COCKTAIL LIST"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, specials and awesome wine selection. The staff was friendly and food was good. Enjoyed the band playing outside on a cool evening."}
{"text":"Awesome food... Chef Nick is amazing!!!! Great negroni's, and gnocchi! I would highly recommend trying the pizza, and the cannoli. It's by far one of the best in southern Nevada!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for my father's birthday. Came around 5:15pm before the dinner crowd. We sat outside...a gorgeous evening.  Service was great and the food was delicious. The waiter, Ryan, was fabulous.  

We ordered soup, main course, had a birthday tiramisu, coffee and cappuccino. I really liked this place. Next time we have guests this will be on the list for an enjoyable dinner. Oh, and there was a guitarist who was fabulous, too. 

Price was affordable. I compared it to other restaurants with similar atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Very patron oriented.  This was our first time here and the food was excellent.  Our server, Carlo, was very attentive and had a great personality.  The manager greeted us and also checked on us halfway through the meal."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The food and ambiance were perfect for a nice night out or even just a dinner with the girls. We were serenaded by a violinist during dinner. The staff was attentive and were quick to meet our every need. The food was fresh. The prices are a bit higher, but the quality is well worth the price tag. I would definitely recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"Like many other previous reviewers, this place simply isn't worth it. High prices, small portions, and a smidge above-average food left much to be desired."}
{"text":"So I went back! Last time I was here was opening night and had a great pizza at the bar with a friendly bartender. I came back for the happy hour menu from 3 to 6 every day the  draft beer was cold and the calamari were excellent! They really do it well and enjoy coming here to relax with a cold one and great apps at great prices! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Glad we found this place on the way back to airport, after a long great day of golf. Spaghetti and meatballs were had by me. Very decent with  good sized portions. Fair service. Pricing seemed a little high, but it is Vegas, everything is!"}
{"text":"So excited to see something new in the district.  Checked out the menu outside and saw how beautiful the interior was.   Not a long wait, as there was only one other table seated and no one else waiting.  We were sold.   


Walked in Friday afternoon at 230.   Greeted immediately and sat by the hostess.   Waiter came out and got our drink orders and was super friendly.  

Drinks came out soon after.   We put in our order for our appetizer and food.  15 minutes goes by and no bread at our table.  No caprese salad. (Strike 1) Mind you, there is nobody in the restaurant except another table and us.  We are now at the 20 minute mark and here comes our food.    But, where is the caprese salad????    Waiter completely forgot, so we said no worries and moved on.  Except, there still was no bread on our table, so we asked for bread and oil and vinegar. He looked down and said their is some on the table and realized he never gave us any (strike 2).   Looked at my plate and realized they gave me a side salad and I asked for fries.  So they messed up on that as well.   (Strike 3).   

1 star for service.  Everyone was nice.  But how do you forget our appetizer, bread AND order of fries.   When the place is completely empty???  

Here's how the food tasted.  

Appetizer 
Caprese salad-never came to the table.   (I do have to point out that he packed one to go since he forgot it on our order).  But, we never ate it.  

Meatball panini -   Good.   Best thing we ate there 

Chicken parm panini - bland.  Dry and flavorless.  Chicken was super thin and no sauce on it. It was disappointing to say the least bc the waiter is the one who suggested it.  


Pasta with tomato sauce.  -  meh.  Nothing fancy.  Just pasta and tomato sauce lol.   

Tiramisu - gave it to us complimentary bc of the mishaps.  It was ok.  Way too much cream.  Not enough ladyfingers.  

1 star for the food

I know everyone makes mistakes.  And so happy to see a new establishment but, need to step up their game.  Especially for the price you are paying for the meal.   If staff can't remember the order, perhaps write it down?"}
{"text":"This gem is tucked away in an alley at Green Valley's District area, but don't let that fool you - going here, you almost feel like you're no longer in Las Vegas, Nevada, but rather in a different part of the world.  It has a romantic, intimate feel.  The food is delicious, and the drinks are fantastic.  I came here yesterday to meet someone, and a friend of mine - Dominique - was bartending.  Others have commented on her ability to make incredible drinks, and I will add on to those positive comments!  Whether you ask for something on the menu, or something not on the menu, it will be one of the best drinks you get in all of Vegas.  I've lived here a little while, and I can testify!  They are thinking of adding live music soon, out on the little patio out front; with the right artists, this can only add to the experience.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Ordered the capellini primavera (11) and panino al pollo (12). The panini was marginal and so was the pasta. Both sub par. The quality isn't worth the price. However the service was okay but the coffee was really good! 

I wouldn't come back here again to be honest."}
{"text":"Overall, it was a very nice experience.  The food was good,  some dishes a little bit salty.  The pizza was great. I had the seabass. It was AMAZING. I absolutely loved it. The service was great. I would go back. We were thanked on our way out.  Very personable."}
{"text":"Our appetizer was phenomenal - salami, mortadella, shrimp, calamari, bruschetta; Chicken Parmesan shared was light, tender and delicious!!  The service was outstanding (thank you Marcos!).   Some of the best Tiramisu I have ever tasted.  The manager stopped by and checked in, just a really nice evening.  A really lovely evening after a long week."}
{"text":"Great location atmosphere is fantastic!

Food is ok, sauce very bland the sauce with the calamari was supposed to be spicy absolutely no spice whatsoever, it taste like they opened up a can of tomatoes and put it in a ramiken and call it sauce.

The sauce for the tagliatelli was also extremely bland the parmesan cheese helped but I had to constantly add salt and pepper.

Now I loved the cannoli I would go back for dessert and happy hour."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for our one year anniversary. The service was exceptional and they treated us very special. I get a truly genuine family vibe here. The panna cotta was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by yesterday during our Christmas shopping and we were happy to have tried this restaurant out. It was around 1:30 to 2. And it seemed really busy for only one waiter to be working that after one other table was sat, they put up a sign that the restaurant was closed. I'm assuming it's to prep for the dinner crowd though and not because it was really busy.

They give you some warm bread, which was really good. 

My husband ordered the meatball panini which he said was \"good\" but doesn't beat the Cappriotti's meatball sub. He also said that for 14 dollars, it seemed a bit on the smaller size.

I had the chicken ravioli with pesto which was really good! The pesto sauce was superb! Although, the color of the chicken looked as though it was from canned chicken. Either way, it tasted good. It's a dinner option but they served it to me during lunch. I didn't even check out the price.

Thurs-Sunday night I believe it says there is live music. I had been at the district before strolling and heard it, and the band seemed good. Don't know if it's the same one every time. This place is definitely worth a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The most impersonal experience ever !
Food was okay by the service made it taste bitter. 
The bartender , first l, forgot my glass of wine ( I got halfway into my dinner) then she messed up my order , (it was served to another table, )then  they tried to Serve half of it to me, I send it back bc I didn't want something that was served else where. 
Nobody checked on us as far as how did the food tasted.
Being in the restaurant industry for over 10 years let me tell you. This is not a place I would recommend . As far as service. 
Go down to Me Gusta Tacos ...your meal will be half the price and more enjoyable, at least the staff is happy to be there !"}
{"text":"First of all, the dinner ambience gets ruined by very bright lighting: Before we even had the chance to look at the menu, we felt already somewhat uncomfortable with the spotlight in our faces. The waitress offered to dim the lights a bit, but nothing actually happened. 

An easy improvement would be to reduce the lighting. The place is lit up like a theater stage. Turn down the lights and use those little candles on the tables!

The appetizers were outstanding, but the entree was mediocre. Especially for the steep price, you can expect some culinary extravagance. The portion size, however, was perfect: just enough to be full without feeling stuffed. Moreover, compared to the other so-called Italian restaurants in town, the food here is pretty close to genuine Italian food (similar to what you would get in Europe).

Unfortunately, this place is not suited for vegans! There are hardly any options for vegetarians which is very disappointing in this day and age!"}
{"text":"We just went to Bella Vita for the first time. We sat on the patio and really enjoyed the live music (this was a Thursday night) and the atmosphere. The service was good, everyone was friendly, drinks were good, and food was great! I had the filet with peppercorn sauce and it was delicious. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm on a strict diet.  I order the salmon rare on a garden salad, no dressing.  The salmon is amazing!!!! Best I ever had.  I will continue to eat here and the staff is amazing!!!  Love Melissa,  Tenisha, and Jen. No waiting for drinks.  Best bartenders ever!!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurants in Las Vegas-Henderson!  
The service was exquisite and the owner spent time coming to our table and was very personable. He sent an after dinner drink to our table which was very much appreciated. 
The menu was excellent and offered many off the menu specialties.  

I asked my meal to be prepared without onions or peppers, which they did and was very accommodating. 

The dishes were delicious and prepared perfectly. 

My complements to Bella Vista. We will definitely be back many times?"}
{"text":"Upscale prices for mediocre food. I imagine it will fool most Henderson residences. Settebello was way better. the manager and what seemed like the owner were like two chickens with their heads cut off, running around like they didn't know what they were doing. The ambiance was uncomfortable. The Singer they had that day was a pompous foreigner singing cheesy old songs. The sound inside the restaurant was loud and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"David provided great service and provided excellent recommendations. He was able to talk about all of the wines by the glass and help each person at our table make the perfect decision. For my meal, one of his recommendations, I had the Veal Ossobuco which did not disappoint. I would order this again. The short rib special was also excellent and the lasagna was worth ordering as well. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Noisy, and not in a good way.  I didn't even realize there was a singer because all I could hear was the sax player who was way too loud.  Service was decent, but honestly, they served one of the worst pizzas I've ever had at an upscale restaurant.  The crust was doughy and barely baked.  I toyed with the idea of sending it back, but I chose not to (maybe because the wine was so delicious).  I'm not really willing to give it a second chance,  but if you read this review and decide to order pizza, be sure to request that the crust be well-done."}
{"text":"I never knew Italian food tasted so good! They really put an authentic taste on everything from the ambiance to the service you'd think you were in Italy! Never had a better experience at a restaurant. Highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Sorry, this place is not worth it. We just had dinner here. It's one room with the feel of  cafeteria style. We ordered Caesar salad with 3 entrees. Broccoli rabe & sausage pizza, pasta Bolognese and gnocchi. I can't even begin with any of it. Nothing was good.  I will never come here again. Oh, edit...the pinot noir was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place was great. 
Great food
Great service
Great environment
Much needed in GVR.

Tried to talk them into bottomless mimosas on the weekends.....we shall see."}
{"text":"Very nice experience overall.  Decor is contemporary and very trendy.  Many higher tables.  Service was excellent, and very prompt.  We had pizza, and a few different pastas, all tasted wonderful.   We will return."}
{"text":"Good food, good service.  I had the veal Parmesan, which they kindly substituted the pasta side for vegetables.  Great wine selection!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why so any people wrote bad reviews for this place. I loved it! They have a great happy hour menu that they offer every day from 3 to 6. They have menu items, wine, beer, and well drinks that are also on happy hour. They have outdoor and indoor seating for the bar and tables. I had one of their cocktails and it was amazing. I could have had 20 of them. The service was great - the girl at the bar was very attentive and friendly. AND they have those hooks at the bottom of the bar table! 
The location is perfect because it's at The District so it's fun to sit outside and people watch while enjoying some vino and great food. Give this place a try and decide for yourself!"}
{"text":"Food: lunch. Chicken parm sandwich and linguine and clams with white sauce. Super disappointed in this place. Food was bland and boring. Even my husband who just thinks of food just as fuel did not want to eat there again - and he works nearby!

Service: Cool and disorganized. Waitress lacked a smile and basic customer service skills.

Location: Love the location in The District and the fact that you can dine al fresco on their outside patio, however the food falls flat and I just can't eat there again, not with so many other Italian options out there. I wish they were good so that I could have a nice Italian option at The District.

They really need to step up their game if they are going to survive."}
{"text":"I never write reviews, because I'm not a chef nor was I trained in the culinary field. 
But, I am a good judge of lackluster service.  I wanted to try Bella Vita out as it's near my home.  We walked in to go to the bar for a couple of drinks and an appetizer.  The Bar was full. 2/3 of the tables empty.  I asked if we could be seated at a table.  We were told the restaurant was fully booked and if we did not have a reservation!  Walked out went to Whist were we had a lovely time!! So, I highly recommend Whist!! No rude host at Whist!!"}
{"text":"What a great change to have great food ,grilled octopus and asparagus risotto was incredible and the electric atmosphere at the same time, we lucked out to have the perfect weather to enjoy the outdoor patio too !!"}
{"text":"Amazing family style restaurant. Made many memories here . A MIST to go to and Fabulous food."}
{"text":"We have now experienced why so many people are raving about Bella Vita at the District in Henderson, NV. The food is excellent; the atmosphere is excellent; and Ryan, our server, was awesome!! Highly recommend--you will enjoy!! Steve P."}
{"text":"We love having a place so close where we can easily pick up a pizza or go to for a casual date night without having to drive too far. The food has been very consistent. The only thing I don't understand is it feels like there are always so many employees and for the most part they all just stand around while 1 person does all the work. However, the 1 person doing all the work is always very friendly and we have had very good experiences here."}
{"text":"Open bar, open air with a touch of elegance and fits right in this Village Walk setting.  The food on the other hand is a completely different story. 

Homemade pasta as stated on the menu, voted 2017 for best something, so how bad could this be?  My lasagna came out over a bed of what appears to be non-doctored tomato sauce and leaning like the tower of pisa with layers of pasta exposed.  First impression, first bite not impressed with the flavor and nothing to run home to.  After my third bite I could tell my pasta was under heated and undercooked.  The last layer of pasta was inedible, tough pieces of chewy dough and at last cold meat in the center.  Naturally, I asked for it to be heated up and ate whatever I could that was not chewy dough and left unhappy.

My husband had the tagliatelle meat sauce and added chicken for extra protein.  The pasta was good, but the quality of meat left him unimpressed.  

On a brighter note, our water was constantly topped off and the bread was good, but our waiter was just so-so.  Maybe the stars are for the drinks and semi-pleasant ambiance, but definitely not for service and the food.  We came, we tried and we don't think it merits another visit."}
{"text":"First visit here after using the other pizza place in Estrella for a few years. First the positive. The Margarita panini was decent. The chips that came with it were rubbery and old, very chewy like a doggie treat in a bag, threw them out. The entire pizza had maybe 1 teaspoon of tomato sauce on the whole pie. It was just cheese and crust, too dry. If I want cheese and crackers I can get that elsewhere. The crust was decent compared to most but overall the pizza as created was lousy. I can't tell if the kid behind the register was Beavis or Butthead but wow good help is hard to find. I guess you have figured out I won't be going back and will return to the other pizza place by the gas station."}
{"text":"A great addition to The District! I especially was impressed with the use of outdoor space and the bar window area. My first visit here was for happy hour, and we sat in the dining room. 
The Bella Vita salad ($7 at happy hour) was excellent, and it's served in a cool bowl too. Prices for happy hour are quite low, at least for The District! A Blue Moon is $4 at happy hour. 
The menu has a nice variety of Italian fare as you'd expect, and the happy hour food is also on the regular menu. 
Service is very attentive, and we didn't have to worry about being ignored."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to love this place. The patio is incredible, they have an amazing happy hour food
Menu, and it's in a great location. 
First, the good which was definitely the food. I ordered the calamari and a Caesar salad. My husband had another salad and gnocchi. The food was great. The server forgot to put the pepperoni on my sons pizza and had to fix that, but overall the food was delicious. 
Now for the bad which unfortunately overshadowed the food. When we were sat, our waiter came out, took our drink order and we ordered waters and two kids apple juices. The juices were brought out immediately but were only 1/3 full.  The water never came.  We finally had to ask a busser for water. By that point the 1/3 apple juice were gone, waiter was nowhere around, and we had to give the kids our water. Not once during our meal did he refill our waters. We had to ask other waiters to do so each time.  He forgot our calamari and gnocchi which we then had to ask for.  My favorite part was he cleared the dishes and didn't ask if he could take mine, which still had calamari on it, and walked off.  Finally when we got the bill, we were charged for the 1/3 apple juice ($3 each) even though the meal was supposed to come with the drink. 

Honestly, if it were just the food, the location, and the bus staff, they would get 4 stars. But this one waiter was so inattentive and terrible that I don't know that I could go back."}
{"text":"Great place to relax and enjoy good Italian food and wine.  I recommend this place.  Great service.  Ask for Ryan, as your server. Gives you his full attention and no rush."}
{"text":"My mom chose this place for her birthday lunch which was fine with me since I had it bookmarked. It is nicely decorated with a large open kitchen and nice bar area. We were seated as soon as we arrived as there were many open tables. 

We started with a glass of house wine which was $10 glass. It was drinkable but not great. We both ordered panini sandwiches with house salads, both $14. The bread that was brought out was good, a mix of focaccia and italian. They put way too much balsamic with the olive oil though making it quite bitter and strong. 

My panino parma was good but not great. The bread was soft and the thick slices of mozzarella tasted home made and very fresh. They could have put more prosciutto however. My mom said her meatball panini was also good. The house salad was fine as well, again, average or slightly above. 

We ordered the cannoli for dessert and since we were told they were small we ordered two. Small was an understatement. They were about 2 bites each and the filling had an odd flavor I didn't care for. They were not sweet at all and at $8 per order way way overpriced. A really expensive lunch for very average food."}
{"text":"This was a struggle to review because I really wanted to love this place, something good in the community that I don't have to drive out of Estrella for...and it's a beautiful facility but I'm not sure the food is worth the price. This was our first time here and as new residents, plus just trying to get my picky eater bf to try something new...Bella Vita let us both down. 
We came hungry for pizza, we've tried Taste of Italy down the road but wanted to see how Bella's pizza stacked up. It was a packed Friday night and we sat in the lounge area which so thought was pretty nice and much more quiet and intimate than the main area. 
I didn't realize that Friday's they serve two additional specials, they had a Chicken Parm which sounded delicious (I wish I had tried that), and also Beef Enchiladas which came out of left field (I wish these were options all the time). 
We ended up trying the garlic knots to start, these were 50/50, the garlic was good, the marinara sauce was yummy but the rolls did not look handmade (nor like traditional knots) they just looked like bread rolls you buy at the store that are stuck together and they just popped them in the oven like that. 
I enjoyed my personal pizza however, the only decent thing of the night, the ricotta was delicious on top and I recommend ordering it \"crispy\". My bf did not and I felt bad because it looked so soggy and the dough was super soft, even a small slice could barely hold up the toppings.
Service started out good and quickly became bad. Very friendly staff regardless but super super slow. I think because the staff had to go from the restaurant across to the lounge it was hard to get anyone's attention if you needed anything. 
We had to ration our drinks, eventually we ran out and I really needed some water, 5-10min later a young man with a longer black coat started walking to each table in the lounge area asking if everyone was doing okay and he even specifically asked us we we needed refills, I said two waters and he never returned and completely forgot about us :( 10min after that the waitress finally returned and we got some water.
She asked about desert so we ordered the S'mores (since another review basically said they were to die for). Maybe having that in my head hyped it up way too much because they were nothing special and a little confusing. I think we were sitting there for probably another 20-30min, it felt like forever,  and my bf completely forgot we ordered desert it was taking so long. I just kept thinking that they must be good if it's taking this long but I was also tempted to just ask for the check and tell them forget it. Finally the waitress emerged. She had told us \"it's smores we make\" but when she placed the bowl down with graham crackers that were still wrapped in plastic...that's where I was confused. I wasn't sure what took them forever to make it because it was a bowl with something like a crumble of very dry chocolate cookies (even the chocolate chips in it weren't even melted) underneath some melted marshmallow and packaged graham crackers. We weren't given any plates so we placed our two napkins out like placemats and had to eat over that. 
I'm not 5 years old but I sure felt like it...just for the price, the atmosphere and tone of the restaurant the dishes all seemed a little childish and again not worth the price. If only the restaurant could get the timing down a little better it would have made up for a lot. Just being able to get little things in a timely manner was a struggle at best and it was so awkward just sitting there waiting and looking around hoping someone would come by. Not a good first impression at all and I don't know if we'll be back. Bummed."}
{"text":"This is my third time here and absolutely love the food and service. A great happy hour also! I'll be back."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try their Happy Hour for some time.  Best of Las Vegas wins got us there.  What a disappointment.  An ltalian restaurant that toasts sliced Wonder bread and serves it with good OO & vinegar, what?  We ordered several of their small plates.  The pasta with Sauce was good, so was bruschetta.  The antipasto was tasteless, even the olives, as was the Caesar's salad.  Service was spotty, our waiter could hardly be bothered with us.  The busboy and l'd guess manager were more helpful.  We also ordered a pizza, which was tasteless.  

Please, go to Settebellos which is just across GVP and has much better food and service for a lot less $$."}
