{"text":"Decent food but this place has never been cleaned.  This place needs a major cleaning job!   Seriously"}
{"text":"Awesome place. They changed up the management and they new people are so nice. The food is also amazing as well. The fried rice is just too good!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried out this little Gem.  Prices are a steal.  So much so that I wonder about the quality of the food.  $2.95 for chicken and rice.  $2.86 for chicken and fries of fried rice.  NUTS.  They could up the prices and then they could afford to do a renovation.  But I think the daily amount of students coming there from the local high-school wouldn't be able to afford it.   Roti is my test of a place and this place is ok.  at $5.50 its good enough.  I think I would still go to T&T for their ~$9.00 roti.  I would never take someone there to eat, but rather get takeout  which is what I think they want to focus on.  They advertise a live dj on Friday and they have music playing all the time on a loud speaker....  very west indian style.  Not sure how this appears.  I believe it's run by Trini/Guyanese. I might be back if I'm in the neighborhood and I'm wanting a cheap meal.  I'd love to see this place put more effort into their location and their presentation.  I sense they just aim for \"acceptable\" enough to make some money."}
{"text":"Excellent Caribbean food. Actually I've found it quite a good value for the amount of food given. It's been here a long long time and as far as I can tell it attracts a loyal following. Definitely worth trying. I just \"tried\" it over 20 years ago and have to say they've maintained a nice consistency. Could use a reno, but it's only the food that matters really.   I know what to expect when I get food from here. Never disappointed."}
