{"text":"Best shawarma in Toronto/GTA. Everything else is delicious as well. Can't go wrong. Been going here for the last 6 years. Always consistent and clean."}
{"text":"Good variety of middle eastern food.  Shwarma, Chicken-on-a-Stick (which can be served on a plate with rice and salad), Humous with Pita, etc.  Steak on a bun is a good choice.  Prices are reasonable.  Seating is sometimes limited during busy lunch hours."}
{"text":"Very good food never been disappointed with them and alway got the best service over all good food and good people"}
{"text":"Stopped by for quick lunch with the family after a long time. Was not disappointed at all! Highly recommend the lamb on a baguette..... fresh, moist and very flavourful. Place was busy so we had to wait for our order a little while but it was worth it. They comped us some fries and little babgahnouche for our trouble .... nice touch, not expected but appreciated. Only one big disappointment - I asked for a glass with ice for my drink and I was told that they don't have ice? Never heard that one before in a restaurant. Nonetheless, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Huge line and bad attitude. Mediocre food. Didn't even know how to wrap a pita properly."}
{"text":"Great food. Horrible service. Cashier guy is an @sshole. Things he's superior. Relax bro, you're a cashier. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and the food is delicious however a bit pricey. We have tried almost everything on the menu, with the exception of the fish, and everything has been great. We Love the chicken shawarma and schnitzel and the salad dressing is out of this world."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant numerous times this year and every visit has been worse than the last.   Customer service is non existent and is borderline rude. You get a blank stare when you walk in and not even a thank you when you pay for your food.   Hygiene seems to not be important since my food was prepared without gloved hands. I ordered two sandwiches one was prepared by the cook, the other was prepared by another member of the staff who just shook hands with another customer.   The chicken shawerma was cold and I'm fairly certain they have mixed in dark Turkey meat. The falafel sandwich I order, had cold falafels in it and a hair in the wrapping of the sandwich.   The only thing that was good about my experience was the fact that the drinks from the cooler were really cold."}
{"text":"A true Israeli Style Shawarma. The only Shawarma in Toronto you can get that tastes like it was just made in Tel Aviv. Friendly and reasonably priced. GO FOR IT.  Best Shawarma in Toronto."}
{"text":"Best falafel on the planet!  I've had 1 million falafel's in many different countries this falafel is the best I have had on this planet by far.  Their ingredients are fresh, crisp, first-rate and plentiful; it's a complete meal for me with salad and veggies.    Included with the falafel is a pickle plate which really adds to the is really experience.  I'm here at least once a week sometimes three or four times a week for their falafel   I'm vegan and it is a real treat for me and I never leave hungry hungry.    The price is right the service is fast and seating is plentiful.  It can be a little noisy when it's busy around lunch time but that's part of their charm"}
{"text":"One of the best shawarmas in Toronto. Very fresh ingredients. The shawarma meat is very tender and good range of toppings to choose from. Nice environment and staff. I would definitely recommend going here and getting the shawarma in the pita bread. Excellent filling food"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Consistently.   I've been going here for over 2 years relatively frequently and the food is always consistently excellent. You can get healthy, fresh choices here which are all fantastic. Service is always friendly and efficient.   Their lentil soup is amazing. Their laffa spectacular.   A must try!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very fast service. Fries didn't look good, but grilled meat taste fantastic.  My chicken kebab dinner came with Salad, Pickled cucumber and pepper, Pita, Rice/fries,Chicken(a lot) for about $15."}
{"text":"Perfect steak, chicken shish very good, even little one ate it. Big portions for low price. Clean and nice place. Kindly staff."}
{"text":"Excellent high quality food for a reasonable price. I go here at least once a week.  Compared to other places the quality and taste of food is the best in the area."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap and cheerful. The baguettes are delicious and loaded generously with various salads. The falafel, beef skewers, shwarma are all great."}
{"text":"Great food but a little more expensive than I'm used to. I guess you pay for the quality. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was great.  The purpose of this review is to let people with allergies know the cashier's lack of knowledge in the food. My cousin is allergic to peanuts and asked if the hummus contained any nuts, the cashier tells us that there are no nuts and she would be fine. In hindsight most hummus contain nuts in the form of tahini or pine nuts, but the fact the cashier explicitly told us that it was okay for her to consume hummus is disgusting. This small mistake caused her to be rushed into the hospital with a severe allergic reaction.  The cashier's knowledge of the menu really shows Meron To Go's negligence in customer service, thus I feel my score is justified despite the good food. Do not go here if you are allergic to anything."}
{"text":"This place has the best shawarma in the city hands down!! The only place as far as I know that offers turkey shawarma as well.. Staff is always warm and friendly and everything on the menu is great!!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Israeli restaurants, upon my arrival the owner assumed I know nothing about the cuisine so he suggested the shawarma and I'm not a fan, so I asked for a beef Kabab , and he suggested steak and this is lunch time and this is not a sit down restaurant so he rings it in and asked me to pay $45!! What a ripoff! Steak was decent their rice was blah and Israeli salad was ok  , I have had better and didn't have to pay that much for it either ,"}
{"text":"I started to go here for lunch with my coworkers because it is close to our office. I tell everyone I know about this place now! Meron's has by far the best chicken breast around. It is always cooked to perfection. Falafel is fantastic and even the fixings are phenomenal! I especially love the baba ghanouj and eggplant. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Over priced compared to far better middle eastern options in the area.    Swarma was appalling.   Chicken was unseasoned and gamey the smell of the chicken could be considered offensive.  Rice was bland.  On a postive note their salad dressing was excellent."}
{"text":"1) They're really quick. We ordered at the counter, then sat down for like 7mins and were served something.  2) The falafels were super SOFT!!!!!! This was the first time I've ever had any, but my company said that they've never had it softer anywhere else!  3) Israeli salad was as fresh as can be. I REALLY liked it.  3) Coleslaw was v pickled!  4) Lamb skewers (medium well) came out to be medium - which was what we wanted! 5) The rice with was nice and fluffy. It went well with the meat oil/sauce/residue.  6) Tahini and Hummus were both super smooth. No complaints but it's also nothing too special, in my opinion.  Apologies for my pictures not being too pretty this time around.. I got too excited to eat and forgot half way through!"}
{"text":"I really like the guys working there, I know the owner, and I've been coming there since day one.   The reason for the low rating is rather simple - the quality of the food has been steadily going downhill, over the past year or so, to a point where I won't go there, unless I really have to (for those wondering how does that work - when you have a meeting with multiple parties, and they all want to go there, you kind of have no choice - exactly why I just went there again)."}
{"text":"Hands down best falafel in the area! Their food is always amazing, but the customer service is terrible. They act like they don't care at all about their customers and are always extremely rude."}
{"text":"I know people often say \"this is the best shawarma\" \"this is the best falafel\", but I swear on my own life this is THE best shawarma/hummus/falafel/pitas I've had in North America.  As an Israeli, it's hard for me to find a place with good shawarma/falafel/pitas, I've tried dozens of places in Toronto, Vancouver, Seattle, and San Francisco.  This is by FAR the best one. I keep trying other places, and none of them come close. I bring all my non Jewish friends here and they are always amazed at how tasty it is, it's not like any other shawarma pita they've ever had before.    People talk about some of the bigger and more well known restaurants, but this is truly the best one."}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious, same employees for a long time, I'm visiting Toronto couples time a year and stop to enjoy shawarma at Meron, definitely clean fresh and testy."}
{"text":"The best Israeli restaurant in Toronto, hands down ! The Schwarz's, falafel, kabobs, soup, French fries, etc are all the best ! Lots of Israelis so you feel like you are in a restaurant in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. The food is always consistent and amazing !"}
{"text":"The food is super good and delicious and great quality. Big portions in comparison with the money you pay. Try it you wil keep coming"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Israeli spots in the GTA. There's nothing that doesn't exceed expectations. I've been a patron for quite sometime and Meron consistently delivers quality and a reasonable price. The steak sandwich is a MUST TRY, the chicken shish-kebabs are juicy and delicious, and all the cold salads are always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Food was nice and filling. Quick like a fast food service type of thing. One thing I didn't like is that my baba ganoush was a tad watery and it tasted like mayonnaise the whole time I was eating my shawarma wrap. I like baba ganoush I just don't like mayonnaise in it. Other than that good service!"}
{"text":"Actually this review is long overdue. I've been eating here for years, I guess I wanted to keep it my 'Little Secret'....I am here at least once a week, usually for dinner with a group of friends. Anything you order from the menu is great, though on our weekly gathering, we have the steaks and all the trimmings. The food is classic Israeli. From hummus, falafel, shawarma, soups, salads and much, much more, I've never been disappointed. Simply great food!! The staff is friendly and accommodating and Albert, the owner, will do everything to make sure you are satisfied. If you are a party of more than 5-6, I'd recommend reservations. The ONLY drawback is that when its crowded, it can get noisy."}
{"text":"Delicious shawarma, hamburgers, and shish kabob. They have whole wheat pitas and good hummus and tahina. A favorite spot for a consistently delicious meal."}
{"text":"A convenient restaurant when you want a falafel.   Not the best one I have had, but definitely convenient for the distance.   A falafel in a pita is more expensive than you'd get elsewhere, but you have some different toppings than you get elsewhere.  The roasted eggplant gives a nice little kick to the sandwich"}
{"text":"Consistently fresh food. You can get a variety of middle eastern dishes and salads.    As a vegetarian I usually get the falafel with salads , in a pita or a plate. Also they have Israeli bevs. Try the mango juice or the grape juice. Love it!"}
