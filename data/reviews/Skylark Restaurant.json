{"text":"I went to this restaurant a few weeks ago for the lunch buffet. I would recommend that you go to another place in the city or even on the same street to get a good experience. The glasses, utensils and tablecloths (we switched tables) were dirty. I ordered a canned drink instead of drinking out of the glass like I normally do. The service was lackluster and the music sounded religious instead of entertaining. The worst part is that the butter chicken tasted off, like it was spoiled. The naans were really nice and hot -- they brought them to the table which is a nice touch. It looks like it could be a higher end restaurant and it's unfortunate that it doesn't achieve that."}
{"text":"Went in with a group of friends and had the buffet. This was less than exciting. I found the food to be very bland and basic. The best was the dessert; canned pears. I won't be back."}
{"text":"good food and great service. The samosa and the gobi aloo were the best!"}
{"text":"On one of the great \"Around the World in 35 Blocks\" food tours run by the 17th Ave Business Revitalization Zone, I was served delicious samosas from Skylark (while browsing the produce next door at Market Produce).  My friend and I vowed to return one day.  Today was the day!  Located in a small strip mall, Skylark serves a buffet lunch from Tuesday to Friday, has three weekend lunch specials (vegetarian, meat or mixed thali) and always serves up a regular menu of a la carte Indian dishes.  As well, there is a small sweet shop at the front of the restaurant if you'd like to grab some baked goods to go.  My friend and I both ordered the weekend special vegetable thali ($9.99) with a mango lassi ($4.50) to drink.  We were served dishes with basmati rice in the center, surrounded by raita, daal, chutney, mixed vegetable curry and sweet rice pudding (for dessert).  We also each received a piece of naan on the side.  All of the food was good, and the lassi was one of the best I've ever had.  The restaurant was busy (especially for a late Sunday lunch!) and based on the quality of our food I'm looking forward to going back for either the lunch buffet or a full dinner from the menu!"}
{"text":"Went today for the first time, and definitely will go back again. The food was super delicious, much tastier than the average bland Indian buffet food. I especially appreciated that it had a bit of a kick to it, normally buffet food caters to the lowest common denominator and has no spice. The servers brought hot, crispy, buttery fresh naan to our table. For only $9.99, you cannot go wrong. The only drawback I found is that it could have had more salad and fresh fruit offerings, I can't eat sugar so was hoping for fruit but they only had melon, which I don't like. A minor thing. For the flavour, quality, and price, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Skylark in a while, so as I popped in recently on a gloomy March afternoon, I was cheered to find that the place hasn't changed one iota since I was there last. The biggest mystery to me is always why this place isn't always completely jammed?  For the quality of the food, there can't possibly be a better lunch buffet deal in Cowtown.   The buffet featured butter chicken (which they do really well), as well as goat (take my word for it, delicious) and chicken curries ... they also had an upscale basmati rice dish, \"cholla\" a chickpea dish along with a mix vegetable / eggplant dish, and \"Matter Paneer\" a vegetarian \"cheese & peas\" entree ...  along with vegetarian pakoras.   For $12. Really?   But wait there's more ... you also get a basket of delicious, fresh naan bread, along with a station with chutneys, hot sauces (because they don't overdo the heat on the curries), fresh papadums, a creamy yogurt dessert and those delicious orange pastry desert things - containing a sugar density that creates a relative blackhole of delicious sweetness if you get too close. The food is fresh and attentively poked and refreshed regularly by the staff who are also quick on the pour with the water dish.   It's unpretentious and clean with enough token Indian artifacts to keep the vibe right, but for the most part,  people are simply there to eat, and there's very little foreplay with this establishment ... people walk in the door ... then walk to the buffet ... then repeat ... be a great place to grab a bite if you were pressed for time."}
{"text":"I first went to skylark a few months agowith my wife when we were on our way to our usual place next door \"The Famous Indian food\" and we were happy with the selection and the quality of the food, and for $9.99 you can't really beat the price.  I went back with my father a few week slater and we were both unimpressed. A lot of the meat dishes were over cooked almost to the point of shredding which indicated to me it had been re-heated a few times, and the meat in the butter chicken tasted off to me.  Wanting to give them them the benefit of the doubt I returned here a few days ago for dinner with my sister and again neither of us was impressed. The quality and flavour of the dishes was mediocre and again the some of the chicken dishes tastes and smelled to me as if the chicken was going off.  Unfortunately I won't be returning here to eat again."}
{"text":"In business for many years at the strip mall on 17 Ave SE and 52 Street .  I am a regular for takeout. One of the best indian restaurants in Calgary. My favorite dishes here are Butter chicken ( unlike anything that is served in other restaurants), Malai Kofta and sweets. Their gulab jamuns are absolutely the best in Calgary. Closed Mondays."}
{"text":"Really like this place... order whenever possible. A bit hard to find the first time but food is quite good and close to Inglewood, great to have it close by.  Place is very small so take out works great!  Reasonable price."}
{"text":"Once again I find myself on the narrow path that seems to lead directly from my house on 17 SW to my dining room on 17 SE.  Skylark was an on a whim decision out of sheer desperation and hunger. on first glance, perhaps not the most modern of places sure, but that is the charm. The food was authentic, flavourful and served with a big smile, My date was vegetarian So after the owner trying to coerce me into ordering butter chicken...I never do btw, seems that butter chicken is the equivilant to being the ginger beef of indian food...Anyways, the owner was pushin the butter chicken, I stated naw, the lady is vegetarian , so he still brought me a little dish for free to sample it.  Ive said it before and Ill say it again...Free Sh*t is what im all about.   Skylark was definitely worth it, affordable and tasty"}
{"text":"So here's the thing: Sometimes the food is SO good at certain restaurants that you don't go for the dining experience, the decor or the ambiance; You solely go for the food. Skylark is one of these places.  When you step foot into this restaurant, your instinct will be to turn around and try somewhere else. It's very plain, the tables are old-skool, there's hardly any decorations, the lighting doesn't add to the atmosphere and the TV is always on. But trust me, go further than the doorway.  The owners are splendid people and boy can they make Indian food. My personal favourites are their gol guppe, their papri chat, their milai kofta and their naan. SO GOOD. They also make a mean sweet lassi and you can get dessert to go if you're too full to have it there!   The prices are extremely reasonable and the portions are decent. Plus you're always greeted with a smile!   The restaurant itself is FAR from inviting, but the food stands alone. Try to get past the humble surroundings and go there for the food! Just a tip though - ALWAYS call before you go because they can be unexpectedly closed depending on whether or not they are catering events. Don't just show up, call ahead!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, I've had a great lunch with some friends, now I can say that I love Indian cuisine! Tasty food, good choices, if you walk around to gerrard st. I really suggest this restaurant. Enjoy! All you can eat!"}
{"text":"Is there no ZERO star..? Avoid the evening dinner buffet.. Most off the items were stale!!! And others were just re heated. None of the items were fresh!!!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. Food is just ok. The gulab jamuns are served cold and not very tasty."}
{"text":"I frequent Skylark, as it's one of my favorites in Little India, and I'm a short drive away.  I must say, this is a pretty good compromise, if you're trying to satisfy the needs of both your omnivore and vegetarian friends.  The buffet is an excellent range of Indian food  - with plenty of choice between bean/lentil based foods vs. beef/chicken.  As for the cuts of meat, they are generally high quality - I barely encounter bones or fat... I can't say that for most of the other restaurants on this strip.  I've always found the staff quite polite, and helpful.  The decor, while not being the best, is functional, comfortable, and clean.  Don't be surprised if you're loosing your pants after the meal... isn't the whole point of buffet: to pig out?  Should you need extra digestive help, try ordering the coffee here, it's pretty good.  They also have specialty coffees - such as an Indian Coffee, which hits the spot."}
{"text":"Dinner buffet is $9.99 and there's a decent selection of meat and vegetarian curries. I think one of the curries was off but the sever didn't seem to agree."}
{"text":"An all-you-can-eat buffet for just $9.99, and comes with a plethora of different types of dishes. The food was super yummy, and they were nice enough to keep refilling our basket of naan! Thumbs up for running into this place in the midst of India Bazaar!  P.S. You'll find other $9.99 all-you-can-eat buffets on the same street, but I can't vouch for their quality because I haven't been there!"}
{"text":"For Calgary standards, I should say this was a really good Indian restaurants. The food was authentic and tasted like homemade food. The service was excellent. We ordered the Alu Jeera sabji, Tandori Naan, and Dhal, and chai. Everything was excellent. The chai could have used some cardamom and ginger but that's okay. Five star, no doubt."}
