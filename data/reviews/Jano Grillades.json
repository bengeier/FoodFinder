{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to do takeout instead of dining in. The place seems very quiet and empty but probably because it is a weeknight.

We ordered the 5 meat combo that was recommended by a fellow yelper. It was kind of pricy especially for just two people but we definitely had leftovers for my boyfriend's next meal. 

We got to choose the 5 meat so we got rabbit, lamb, sausage, chicken, and quail. The combo came with 2 pieces of each type of meat, two salads and a huge bag of fries. The rabbit taste kind of funky but I thought it was only because I had a strong sense of taste/smell so I told my bf to try it, he did not like it either! I honestly felt like gagging after trying to chew it. So we ended up throwing the rabbit pieces out. Our favorite was lamb & the quails. I did not try the chicken because I was already full from all the fries but bf says it's like any other grilled chicken. The sausage was very dry and not much flavor besides salty. 

If I go back, I would only get the lamb & quail next time! You can also split the meal between 3 or 4 people if you are not a big eater."}
{"text":"My partner and I went here for a late dinner on Sunday and had a great experience. Right from the start the waiter was warm and smiling and cracking jokes. We got there around 10:30 and it closed at 11:30 so by the end of our meal the restaurant was completely empty and they were cleaning tables but we didn't feel as though we had to rush out. He even approached us to say to take our time. 
We ordered the calamari to share to start and it was the best calamari I have ever had. Forget the deep fried pieces of calamari, this was actual big pieces and they were not battered, maybe they were pan fried or baked or something but they were delish! They were served with some spicy oil to drizzle on them and lemon wedges. 
For our main courses I ordered lamb cooked medium and came out that way which was nice. It was a little oily though I must say. It was served with fries and a house salad. My partner ordered a chef's special platter of different meats and on it was lamb, chicken, pork and sausages or sort. Best chicken ever! Charred and crispy. The waiter said they cooked it on charcoal. 
Great service, great appetizer, good meal!"}
{"text":"Excellent, really delicious Portuguese grill. We tried the chicken and the chorizo which was served with a salad and fries. Both were great. The bread and olives served complimentary were also excellent. Apparently this is the first portuguese grill in Montreal.

Totally recommend it. The owner Carlos is a very friendly and nice to talk to. You pay at the counter."}
{"text":"As a large group (10 in total), with no dinner reservations, we set out on to the strip in  search of food. The front window into the kitchen at Jano caught our attention and we decided to pop-in. The staff swiftly accommodated us despite it being a very busy Friday night at the restaurant. They were very attentive and helpful with the menu. Service was quick and overall just superb. The food was fantastic. I went with the special of the day (lamb, chicken, & potatoes) and was blown away by the elegant simplicity of the dish (and that hotsauce - wow - I really did put that sh!t on everything).

Will definitely be paying them a visit my next time in town."}
{"text":"Really great Portuguese chicken, I love their dip sauce, just great. Also, I love the olives they give at the beginning, I always ask for more lol. Portion size is great and fills you up good. Food tends to be more on the oily side, you can see the side fries in the plate being drenched in oil, but i don't mind it at all. I would recommend their assorted meat dish (i think it was the chef's choice dish). I tried their lamb and it was pretty good as well. Service was great and quick. One of my favourite portuguese restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Was expecting to experience authentic Portuguese grilled meats but we were left really unsatisfied.  The french fries were really good though and perhaps the best part of the meal, maybe that is why they give so many.  We had the mixed plate of a choice of 5 meats.  Chicken, Rabbit, lamb, sausage and pork loin (we got the ribs instead which tasted so strong...of pork),  I just couldn't eat it.  The food was so \"blah\".  The dressing in the starter salad was too watery.  Not very tasty.  This was a meat platter to be shared by 2 people and we only had two very small pieces of chicken.  The chicken leg was so tiny I think the chicken had been on a diet.  After I mentioned this to the gentleman, he was nice enough to bring me 2 complimentary pieces of chicken so that showed a lot of class.  It must be mentioned that the service was excellent and they are very friendly."}
{"text":"ohhh my god    ,  we had chicken  and calamar   ,   best ever   
was my first time and will not be the last , i was informed that jano is been around for long time around 35 years or more serving great portuguese chicken
that makes them the first portuguese restaurant in montreal serving grilled fish chicken   and of course the calamar  hummy"}
{"text":"Excellent place if you are a meat lover. They do serve fish, calamari, sardines. Ordered the $40 mixed grill meats.. Delicious, love the quail and rabbit. Great customer service. For dessert try the Delice Maison...nice finishing touch!"}
{"text":"Delicious! And the owner is fabulous - very proud of his restaurant and the long family ties to it."}
{"text":"What a great meal!  Chicken and sausage were fantastic.  But the spicy sauce really makes it.  I put it on my fish, my fries - it would be great on anything.  And the owner was very friendly.  He even gave us some extra of the sauce to take home with us!  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Portuguese in Montreal. They open late, if you are looking for a decent dinner at 11pm, this is the one. My favorite dish, if you are going with a friend, is the five-meat selection. My choice of combination is quill, squid, rabbit, lam, and portuguese sausage. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. This place was recommended to us as we have spent some time in Portugal and love peri peri everything. 
We both ordered the 1/4 chicken breast and holy cow that 1/4 chicken was huge. 
I upgraded to the Portuguese potatoes and they were delicious. Put the hot sauce on everything as well. Comes with a nice salad to start and bread as well. 
FYI the natas come with cinnamon on them. My bf doesn't like that."}
{"text":"Très bon portugais. Service courtois et rapide. Les frittes maison accompagnent efficacement les grillades. L'assiette est  copieuse. Très bon rapport qualité-prix."}
{"text":"Montréal has some amazing Portuguese food, but we didn't find any at Jano. I won't bother listing the dishes we ordered, because they all ended up being $20 plates of uninspired grilled meat with mediocre fries. The hot sauce was the only thing that made it interesting, and wasn't nearly enough to save this meal.

When was the last time you've had boring Portuguese food? I was honestly baffled. At least the desserts were decent.

The service was disinterested, and while I'm fine with going up to the counter to pay, it would be nice if they said that that was what you had to do, instead of just stopping service after the last plate was delivered. The space was also very noisy while we were there."}
{"text":"What the heck is wrong with all the five star reviewers? Went here last night. No sense of hygiene. Un-eaten bread is reused for next table. Hot sauce is put on with a brush directly onto eaten food without being washed or changed between tables. Yuck. Lost my appetite here."}
{"text":"Love it here. The chicken is fantastic and they have a great hot sauce. Fries are crispy and must be made from fresh potatoes to be that good. 
The diner also comes with a salad, huge roll, and a bowl of olives."}
{"text":"Probably the best Portuguese chicken in Montreal. Great friendly service, and the atmosphere is awesome. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and had such great prices that I would recommend it to anyone on even the tightest of budgets! Considering that me and a friend are backpacking, thier food and prices are a def steal!"}
{"text":"Fabulously grilled meat and fish.  This tiny place is down to earth and delicious.  The grilled calamari is a tasty, especially when smothered with their spicy butter sauce.  Not vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"I love bbq and Restaurant Jano always satisfies that craving, Portuguese style.  You see the meats chargrilling on the bbq right at the street side display window and you can't help but go inside to try the food!

The lemon and garlic giant tiger shrimp appetizer was very tasty and the Portuguese grilled sausage was amazing!   The Portuguese cabbage soup was good as well but nothing memorable.  The meals come with salad and the balsamic vinaigrette, in which the vegetables are mixed in with, was tangy and delicious.  There is a lot of food coming, so don't waste your appetite on the basket of bread loafs and butter that comes to the table right as you sit down; don't say I didn't warn you!!!

For the main course, we wanted to try everything so we took a five meat sampler for two.  Lamb chops, rabbit, flame grilled chicken, ribs and veal.  Oh my, I was in heaven and back; the bbq was amazing and the meat very tender.  We upgraded the fries to house made chips and that was a smart move, those thinly sliced potato shavings are addictive!!! I dunked them in ketchup emptying half the bottle they brought with the hot sauce, mayonnaise and their house Portuguese chili oil for the meat; that is some serious hot sauce!

Dessert ended with the grilled Portuguese egg tart, creme caramel and chocolate mouse.  The egg tart is goodness In a bite.  The saying \"a moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips\" may be true, but these sweet bites of dough crust, custard and cinnamon that are bonded by the smoking grill are orgasmic! #FoodPorn"}
{"text":"Jano....Jano.
Your roasted chicken is great and all of the other items that are grilled. 
Here is some advice for you: lower your wine prices and get rid of that grape juice you call house wine.
Good food calls for good wine. So, if your food is good why not make it tastier and more enjoyable with wine as it should be. Very few people were drinking wine with their meal and to simply put it-save money. Now, we know that wine is not terribly expensive so do yourself a favor."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here for dinner after just landing from Vancouver. It was a great choice. Good food and polite if not overly friendly staff. Ordered a jug of sangria and people watched out the window. 

We would recommend it because the food won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Food is good, that is it for the 3 stars. Service is bad, it took 20 minutes to order and it took another 30 minutes for the food to arrive. For 30 minutes no one even asked do you need water, while the food is spicy. If you are short of staff, hire!"}
{"text":"I was a bit weary of coming here considering the mixed reviews but gave it a shot anyways. I had the chicken which was flavourful, juicy and tender. The fries are good as well I didn't find them particularly greasy. A yelper mentioned previously that the salad dressing tasted store bought which isn't true. It's actually more vinegar than oil and doesn't have that gelatinous Kraft texture. I like their hot sauce but I've always wondered if they change it in between customers. Service is ok."}
{"text":"Adorned with a big cock outside (the bird, you sick people...), Janos great place for a cheap and simple dinner. As a stranger whispered to us like the code into a speakeasy, I would also suggest to \"get the chicken.\"
Along with your chicken breast, salad with a dill dressing, and a side of fries, you will also have fun painting on chili oil from a mug onto your chicken. While extremely spicy, it's quite an experience smothering your perfectly grilled chicken breast with glistening spicy fat."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place from my fiance for years, and last week he finally got me to go there. Although it doesn't look like much, the chicken here is DELISH. Grilled to absolute perfection, my chicken dinner was very juicy - I was quite sad when I had the last bite...

I also had some lamb on the side, but must admit that I've had way better. The bread is served cold and is a little bland. These two factors are the reason for the 4 star rating.

Otherwise, service was fast, and the prices were decent. Will definitely be back for some chicken! Try it out - you will love it, I'm sure :)"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Call me food snob from New York, but if this Portuguese restaurant is one of the more highly rated mid-range restaurants that Montreal has to offer, then I'm a fool for trusting the reviews.

Visiting and in the mood for something Spanish/Portuguese, found this place near the hotel via Yelp. Complimentary Portuguese rolls (basic bread and butter) and olives were provided.

--Grilled Shrimp - Do you think $10 for 4 pieces of shrimp you can grill yourself with a chili oil based sauce is worth it?

--Chefs Choice - Combo of pork, chorizo, lamb and chicken. If this is a sampling of what their main meat entrees are, then no thanks. The pork was underwhelming in flavor, lamb tasted gamey, chorizo doesn't even come close to tasting like the real thing. The chicken was probably the best thing out of them all with a nice char on them.

--Rib Steak - Nothing special. Requested it to be cooked medium well (for the lady) but it came out more undercooked. Flavor was just ok, but not that memorable. Ended up being more fat than actual edible meat so don't let the overall size deceive you.

There's no bill handed to you at the end, which is a first that I've experienced. Instead you have to walk up, wait for a server to finish their duties before you can pay. Completely backwards system.

New York City Portuguese and Spanish restaurants completely out perform this place for sure."}
{"text":"We went here based on a locals recommendation, the Yelp rating, and food photos. I ordered the calamari, trout, and also tried the lamb chops. I was really disappointed with the the flavour of the trout and lamb. I was actually unsure if the trout was a bit off and didn't finish the dish. The calamari was really small and wasn't grilled long enough. The spicy sauce was good, but the presentation in a mug with a ratty paintbrush wasn't very appetizing. The fries had good taste, but some of them were really greasy. The salad was fresh, but the dressing tasted store made.  The only thing I really enjoyed were the hot pickled peppers which accompanied the dishes. 

Honestly I wouldn't recommend this restaurant or go again."}
{"text":"[ My Order ] : Got the combo : Chicken + Lamb

Chicken tasted a little salty for me - Fries were soggy."}
{"text":"$40 mixed grilled platter. Bring a friend. Or.. 2 friends, if you are a normal person, unlike me, who has a ferocious appetite befitting a male twice my size.

We picked calamari (the only seafood besides sardines you can choose from), lamb, pork, rabbit, and quail (can't choose beef either). All of them were amaaaaaaaaaaaazing! Its simple preparation (and really smart restaurant operation/business plan) brings out the natural flavors of the different proteins and just adds some grilled flavor to it. Delish. We had a little left over for rabbit sandwich the next day too.

Shortcomings, staff wasn't as warm as I expected from such a cozy place at this. And a bunch of grilled meats means not a whole lot of complexity or contrast in flavors, even though they did provide mountains of fries.. which we've had plenty of in Montreal."}
{"text":"It's been several years that we have gone for dinner at Jano.  Excellent food & great value.  Nothing fancy yet clean & consistent.  We usually have the chicken brochette however they also have excellent fresh sardines.  All is cooked on an open fire roasted pit."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, like Nando's on crack! I had the liver steak and it was delicious. The atmosphere is fantastic and the service was great. Worth the trip to Montreal just for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went there after reading the reviews but the place kind of disappointed me. It was dinner time but the place was empty. Only a waiter for the whole restaurant. Service was slow. We ordered lamb and catch of the day. The fish is almost ok if I didn't taste the gallbladder. And the lamb just sucks for we can taste the meat is not fresh. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"So good. The Dorado was grilled perfectly, and the fries are always good. Fish and fries, what more do you need?"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with the chicken and fries even though I don't usually like to have fries I went with the classic. Chicken was crispy on the outside with a good BBQ and full of flavour!!!! The staff was also very nice and helpful but I can't say it's the classiest place but great food!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a busy friday evening, and the wait was worth it.
The grilled calamari were just delicious. I had the grilled sardines and my friend had the combo (chicken and lamb). Both were great. The service was friendly though maybe quick (there was a line of people waiting outside so the waiters were probably pushed to make service quick!) 
The only down point was that we found it a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Grilled calamari was excellent. I took 4 choice of meat, with fries. The house sauce was great too! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Everytime i go in Montreal I have to take the chicken at Jano. Awesome service take the sauce with you fried and food. Tiramisu pudding is very very tasty!"}
{"text":"I love this Portuguese family restaurant.  They have the best chicken and spicy house sauce.  I always get the drumstick and fries.  The home made potato chips are the best too.  I never care for bell peppers, but for some reason its soo tasty.  I must say they also have one of the best home-made sangria I ever had.  Now, I know how they're suppose to taste like.  I always go here when I visit my boyfriend in Montreal.  It inexpensive and pretty reasonable in price.  Everything is tasty good and home-made here."}
{"text":"Rien que pour les sardines grillées, ce resto vaut le détour !
Et après, il y a tout le reste : l'ambiance hyper friendly, les serveurs sympathiques, les bonnes odeurs de grillades, et les grandes tablées d'amis ! 
Pour le reste, à part les sardines grillées, la soupe est super bonne. Et enfin, le plus difficile, c'est de faire son choix : tout est bon !!! :)"}
{"text":"Great grilled fish and pretty much grilled anything...HIghly recommended if you're into grilled meats. Also, the small Portuguese custard desserts are cheap and fantastic, worth trying."}
{"text":"This place makes it to my Top Ten favourite food spots in Montreal.
We eat here atleast once a week!! 
Their Rotisserie chicken (fries & salad) comes with this sauce which is a game changer. They sell that separately as well, a jar for $10 and I usually end up taking one home to add to food later. 
I have tried four other Portuguese places in the area but none of them come close to the experience and taste of Jano'sss!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the food was very average and pricey. During my most recent visit, I had the lamb chops. They were very tasty but my plate consisted of 65% fries, 25% meat and 10% of some sad looking and tasting roast peppers. 

I am a huge fan of spicy Portuguese cause so I tried some from the pot on the table and it turned out to be huge mistake, the sauce was so salty that my food was almost inedible. 

What bothered me the most was the amount of oil on the plate, everything was drenched in oil and halfway through the meal, I just couldn't eat anymore."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews for Janos, I was quite looking forward to eating there. However, I must say that the best word that summarizes my experience is: meh. 

I think the service was the biggest problem. It was really slow. We had to ask the waiter twice to bring us water. We never got the ketchup and mayonnaise for our fries, but the table behind us did! Actually, if we wanted to speak to the waiter, we had to poke him on the shoulder. 

The food itself: The salad was good and so were the sardines. The fries were really average. They were not crispy at all. 

The plates were quite big. I had the chicken and it met my expectations for the place. Portuguese people do know how to cook some delicious chicken. I loved the spicy sauce to put on it. It was very very spicy. It added some flavour to my fries who were very bland otherwise. 

Conclusion: Maybe it was just a bad day, but I will not go back there. I still prefer Cocorico."}
{"text":"if you are a big meat eater, you should definitely come here!!  this portuguese restaurant gets pretty crowded, but it's pretty cute and quaint.  i got a grilled fish here, and it was a hefty portion and delicious."}
{"text":"The food was really great. Great place for meat. Wish they didn't serve fries on the side of everything.  Vegetable option please!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so by far the best chicken cooked in this rotisserie style evah. The sauce is spicy and a must.  The house wine is great and the fries are great. Great value all around"}
{"text":"We came here after the line at Romado's was far too long.
Definitely worth it! Super tender chicken with an exceptional hot sauce. They give you more than enough with the plate of fries, salad, and refillable bread basket (their bread is also amazing too). Also has a nice ambiance and the waiters are friendly! I would come back here with my boyfriend."}
{"text":"had le combo and chicken noodle soup.

in term of taste, this is best Portuguese grill I have had. but when the waiter gave me the menu, there was some nasty stuff on it."}
{"text":"This is in my small list of must-go-to Montreal restaurants when I visit. Further, I've sent all my friends who visit the city here, and all report back great experiences. In fact, thinking about writing this review makes me want to fly to Montreal and eat here. Must. Have. Jano's. Chips!

My only dinger, at all, would be that the service can be a little slow in busy times. Shocker.

My recommendation is always the Mixed Grill, which I include: Quail, Chorizo, Calamari, Rabbit, and TBD. Mixing in chicken, sardines, liver steak, etc bring a nice bit of variety. Ideally come as a group of 4 and just get a ton of food to share.

Also, I suggest splitting the chips and fries - both are excellent.

The spicy chili oil is good, don't forget to mix/stir it before adding to your plate!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Comparing it to the gold standard (Romados), Jano is at least 95% as good, and has the following advantages:
-Beer on tap
-Better selection (lamb, rabbit, quail, etc.)
-Much better ambience
-Olives
-They give you a warm mug of chili oil to brush onto all your food as you see fit. Except it's more like chili grease than chili oil. It's definitely something that's not liquid at room temperature.

(The only disadvantage on Romados is the heftier price. The portions are smaller too, although they're still impressively large)"}
{"text":"Loved it!  I had the calamari as an appetizer and the 1/4 Chicken Breast with Fries on the side for the main meal.   The calamari was seasoned with some light spices and served with the small salad.   Although the portions were somewhat limited (4-6 pieces), I thought they were well cooked.  The chicken is just awesome.  Grilled to perfection and served along with a spicy sauce.  The fries looked hand cut and made the perfect side.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great grilled chicken meal.  The price is fair and the service is great!"}
{"text":"We popped in here for a late dinner. It was a bit dead (maybe one other table seated) but they were very responsive and quick. I really enjoyed the chicken and fries. It was very good. Salads were fresh and the sauces were nice too."}
{"text":"This is our go to Portuguese place! The meat is always cooked to perfection, super juicy and tender and the spicy sauce is out of this world! The service is always great and the portions are big! Definitely worth the stop and I'm sorry to say for the Romados fans, this place kicks their ass!"}
{"text":"food amazing love the semi spicy hot sauce. chicken was just soo tasty. Waitress was super nice. the weather was nice so we ate outside. calamari was good grilled not fried, but very tasty. would definetely recoomend. Price was not too bad for 2 with a pitcher of beer came out to 53 dollars"}
{"text":"The food, combined with the service, made this place one of the best experiences I've ever had in Montreal.

I highly recommend the grilled calamari they have here, absolutely tasty and juicy! Some other highlights include the shrimp, anchovies, and the steak.

The customer service was superb as well, one of the waiters even taught us how to properly take out the bones in the anchovies when he saw we were having trouble. Now THAT'S service!"}
{"text":"Je connais depuis un certain temps. L'entré calmars est délicieuse et le poulet est suculant. Le service est très bien aussi!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place that I had pretty high expectations.
Now that I've tried it, I'm quite disappointed, and I think that the fanfare is there because it has a legacy and tradition rather than quality. I hate to break it to you, it's nothing special. The meals are sloppy, with a heap of greasy fries filling the plate. Yes, you leave full, but it's because of bread and fries. The meat dishes are average. And way overpriced. The salad is as basic as you can get. It feels like a fast food restaurant with airport pricing.

In short: average, expensive and sloppy."}
{"text":"Great place. 

Perfect for some wine/beer and great food. Excellent chicken, meat, lamb, seafood dishes with fries and salad. Very simple, but very very good. Great relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. Good prices and location too. Will totally go back eventually."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant ! La nourriture est très bonne. Les aliments sont frais et la viande est cuite à la perfection. Les plats sont remplis de saveurs ! De plus, le service est excellent. Vous ne vous tromperez pas en allant à ce restaurant !"}
{"text":"Excellents plats Portugais de grillades."}
{"text":"Even better than the other Portuguese restaurants I've been to. Perfect chicken and chorizo!!!"}
{"text":"It is a cosy little portuguese restaurant on Saint Laurent. They do know how to grill meat. I loved their grilled chicken, especially the spicy sauce which came. The french fries on the side were crisp and nice. They have a decent bar but I was surprised that they did not make old-fashioned!"}
{"text":"Everyone always goes on about Romados this and Romado's that (granted, I'm guilty of it too), but if you're craving some seriously scrumptious and authentic Portuguese grill, you owe it to yourself to visit Jano. 

Whether you're starting simple with the quarter chicken combo, or swinging for the big leagues with their five meat plate (for two), you are guaranteed to leave with a smile on your face. 

All the proteins are prepared to perfection: squid, rabbit, duck, lamb chops, chicken... these guys are seriously masters of the grill. A simple salad and fries round out the plate.

And if you're feeling bold, go ham on the hot sauce. But be warned, they are not messing around with that weak shit. This is some serious hotness."}
{"text":"Small, casual restaurant with excellent fish, prices and service. I had the grilled sole and it was enormous and delicious, especially with their special hot sauce. I also had a Quebec beer, Boreale Blonde, which was quite good."}
{"text":"Jano was recommended by a friend, so while we were in town we decided to try it out. The aromas were inviting, as was the site of the cook working the grill in front. While waiting in line I took the time to scope the place out: cozy atmosphere with classic (read: unoriginal) Portuguese/Mediterranean decor. We were quickly seated at a table for four. I thought the seatings were a bit tight but nothing to detract from the overall experience. 

Rolls and butter were ready, as was a bowl of olives. The menu offered a great variety of starters and entrées. We started with grilled calamari and a litre of house wine. The chicken and lamb combo was interesting, but I decided to stick with the quarter chicken and fries. 

Five pieces of calamari at $10 did not seem like a great deal as they were lacking any flavour without having to drench it in their home sauce (which is delicious). The wine was fine. The chicken was well cooked - charred and tender. The sauce only made it better. I hate to criticize the fries but they really took away from the dish as they were saturated in oil and over salted. The dish also came with a small garden salad dressed with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. 

We left satisfied, but neither of us could justify the $30+ bill (each). I would say the best thing this restaurant has to offer is its sauce, as they were even selling jars of it at the front!"}
{"text":"Jano has been around forever  - I think it is owned by the same folks who run Coco Rico's a few doors up but don't quote me on that. I don't eat here all that often but it can be hit or miss. I had a bavette steak here a few years ago which left me unimpressed but then I had the Mixed Grill plate here a few days ago and I liked Jano all over again. I consider grilled meats a comfort food so if that is what you are into, go for it. 
Solid, basic Portuguese grilled food, sardines, calamari, rabbit, sausage, lamb chops, chicken, shrimp, fries, bread, salad, soup - no surprises. I love spice so I always put that spicy sauce on everything. 
The sangria is also pretty decent and the Portuguese egg tarts for dessert are a must. I've also never had a problem with service. Prices have been steadily going up the last few years but the Mixed Grill Chef's Special is probably one of the best deals in town since it gives you a bit of everything."}
{"text":"My wife and I hit this spot based on Yelp reviews on our first night in Montreal.  The food was solid and, while not mind blowing, was backed up with great service and interesting offerings.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very warm and inviting.  There is a distinct old-world flavor with brick walls and wooden tables, almost reminding me of an classic style pizzeria in New York or a vineyard restaurant of some kind.

The chop salad was, believe it or not, arguably the highlight of the meal.  These guys clearly care about produce, and the simple blend of dressing, tomatoes, veg and leafy greens was delicious.  I'd go back for that alone.

The Mixed Grill was, no pun intended, a bit of a mixed bag.  We got a mixed plate that contained Chicken, Rabbit, Squid, and Beef.  The squid was way over-done, and the rabbit was also pretty tough.  The beef was good.

The chicken... oh man the chicken.  The chicken was, as other reviewers have indicated, so freaking good.  The meat was moist, succulent, insert delicious adjective here. 

The sauces they served were also great and had a lot of flavor.

So overall, a good place to eat with some individual things that are superb."}
{"text":"This place is great! And inexpensive to boot! When we got there, it was packed, but were seated within a few minutes. The entire time we waited, we were checked on, which made us feel at ease. When we were finally seated, our server took our orders within minutes. And the food was served very shortly afterwards. We ordered the chicken, quail, and chorizo....all three are awesome, the portion sizes are hearty; and the fries are pretty good (still crunchy, even though they didn't seem so)! Their hot sauce is amazing, and I will definitely go back here again!"}
{"text":"Still 5 stars but I just wanted to say that my second time around was even better! I did get the grilled calamari again but also the shrimp which was DELICIOUS - wish it came with more.

The service this time around was FANTASTIC. We had two gentlemen serve us and they were both super friendly, attentive and just overall great at hosting. I will always come back here anytime I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Walked into this restaurant hypnotized by the smell of the grilled Portuguese sausage...

Ordered salad, sausage, shrimp, sweet red peppers, and a quarter chicken with fries.

The chicken with fries were probably the best I've ever had - Delicious!. Full of flavour and so tender it melted in your moth. The sausage with its characteristic smokiness was pretty good too. Everything else was just alright.

Service was lighting fast!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is always the busiest of all the Portuguese restaurants in this neighbourhood. Delicious grilled chicken and lamb, french fries and a salad for 15$.  What's not to love about that! No fuss and definitely hits the spot, especially with the spicy sauce that I smothered on my chicken at least 5 times.

Must come back and try the grilled calamari next time."}
