{"text":"Best tacos ever. Love the chorizo. But the hamburger ( hamberguesa) is the best burger I have ever had..,love this hidden gem ."}
{"text":"I ordered tacos it was delicious, friendly environment the only problem was that the tacos were really small compared to other restaurants to what I'm accustom. Overall I will go back but to try something else. I just hope it's not small like the tacos were."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Charlotte to get tacos de trompo. One of  the most  helpful staff I've ever seen. And not to mention they're low prices and and fast service.  Ps. Be careful with the red hot sauce."}
{"text":"Los mejores tacos al pastor (trompo) en charlotte!! La salsas deliciosas!   buena selección de aguas frescas"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos. Packed with great flavors. Eat there so you can enjoy the homemade sauces and fresh condiments that are served in abundance. This was the only Mexican place good enough for a California dude to take his daughter who's been spoiled by all the great California Mexican food we grew up on while she visited."}
{"text":"I knew you wanted to go here. I Regio mind.  It's a really delicious authentic Mexican Taqueria in the nether regions of Charlotte (ahem) serving Monterey-style food. Trompo tacos are the regional specialty, sort of like Pastor meat but better.  Service was absolutely wonderful as well and perhaps best of all I was able to sing some awesome Spanish-language songs in karaoke after my dinner which kind of gave me indigestion but it was worth it.  Now speaking of things that give me indigestion, but are worth it, your mother is calling me again."}
{"text":"The one and only place in Charlotte with real Tacos de Trompo (also called \"al pastor\"). Basic Order ask for 4 \"de trompo\". A must try: The Burger Regia. All the menu is very affordable."}
{"text":"I'll write a more expansive review later, but this place is legit Monterrey style tacos. Menu is very limited, but everything is good."}
{"text":"Tacos are great! Excellent service &  friendly staff. The prices are extremely reasonable! The menu is very simple so why not try a variety of items! They even let you sample anything! We enjoyed the Taco De Trompo (aka El Pastor) great flavor! Also, the de Alambre (steak, bacon & chorizo (sausage)) - you can't go wrong!   Everything is freshly made - I know we will return hidden gem right between E WT Harris & Lawyers road."}
{"text":"Best tacos I've had in NC. Very authentic, no shortcuts, great environment. I'll def be back."}
{"text":"This place is a definite hidden gem. Tacos are authentic and corn tortillas taste like they were just made. Definitely on my list of must go to places."}
{"text":"Buenos tacos buenas hamburguesas unos de nuestras gemas escondidas mi nene y mi familia ama este lugar la señora super amable ( i really love this place, this is hidden gem, you have to try tacos de trompo with green salsa so delicious, not expensive even you can see when they are making your food)."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious tacos. You'll want to eat more than 2. Also they don't play with the hot sauce. It will hurt you."}
{"text":"I was just in Mexico City, Mexico and tried al pastor tacos that are slow roasted for hours on a spit called a trompo. Since I've been back in Charlotte I have searched for these style of tacos and have finally found an awesome comparison!! Tacos el Regio doesn't disappoint. You have to try the Trompo tacos! That is the reason to go here!! The other food is great as well but the tromp tacos will change your life."}
{"text":"I love checking out new, international spots all over town. It makes me feel like I'm traveling but without the cost of airfare! Lunch at Tacos El Regio transported me to Mexico with their authentic al pastor (although they call it de trompo -- a regional description from its resemblance to a kid's spinning top toy) and fresh toppings.   We sampled almost all of their tacos... and then ordered seconds. At $1.50 a taco, why not try them all?!? My favorites were the trompo and chorizo. The tacos came with the most amazing side of roasted onions and pineapples. As if that wasn't enough, they also bring you a giant bowl of fresh chopped cilantro and onions, limes, sliced radishes and two salsas -- red and green -- both delish.   A few tips about this place... If you don't speak any Spanish, be ready to point to the menu to indicate what you want. It might not be a bad idea to look up a few of the words on their menu before hand to be ready. I speak just enough Spanish to be dangerous in a place like this. ;) Also, be sure to order an \"agua fresca.\" I recommend the pina (pineapple) but they also have mango and horchata (milk/cinnamon)."}
{"text":"Excellent taco!!!! Best in Charlotte. A must try place for delicious food.  Wish they had authentic chips and salsa.   But excellent food they had here"}
{"text":"Kind of an odd place. Decor is pretty awful. Not a great location. They serve you on Styrofoam plates. Drinks come in bottles and cans. Menus are dirty and cut off. All that said, the food is really tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent hidden gem. Very small menu but the food is amazing and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Best tacos de trompo in charlotte. I've tried many other places and this is my favorite place so far. They are not cheap with the toppings such as the cilantro and the onion unlike other places I've been. They also give you a small side of pineapple and grilled onions. The waitresses and the cashier which I think is the owner are always nice and attentive."}
{"text":"This far the best taco place In whole Charlotte everything so fresh! And very low prices!"}
{"text":"Best tacos I've ever had. Went to this place 3 times in the past 3 weeks, always fresh tasting food, great flavors and friendly service. If you want authentic tacos, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Best taqueria ever! I'm a gringo and most taquerias fall short, but this place has great food, quick service, is very clean, and did I mention the food?! I will most definitely be back here to eat!"}
{"text":"Great and authentic nortern mexican taqueria. Is the same type of tacos you will find at Monterrey city, where I spend almost 6 years during college.  The menu is great, except ofr one little detail I will explain belos. Try the trompo if you eat pork.  One of my favorites are the gringas, piratas and campechanas.  Havent tried the tortas yet, so cant speak about them.  Servoce is pretty great, and they speak spanish.   There is a karaoke on the back, havent tried it yet. Looks like fun.  I lime the rotarion of their \"aguas frescas\", they taste great and always on par with the season. Already tried pineapple, tamarind, mango and horchata.  Only reason I dont give a 5 star, I just realize today they are not very vegam friendly. If I take one of my vegan friends there they might end up eating a papa al horno, with pretty much nothing on them."}
{"text":"Great tacos! I love the tacos de trompo. Pineapple is so good! Also the accompaniments are delicious. Wonderful pico and salsas. The gringo is good too. Next time, going to try the torta!"}
