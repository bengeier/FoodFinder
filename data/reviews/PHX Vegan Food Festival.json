{"text":"As other reviews have noted, this festival needs (1) a better venue to reduce confusing long lines/wait times; and (2) a better food value for its entrance fee of $25. Do not expect much sample-wise. (Suggestion: entrance fee includes tickets that can be exchanged for food items from the vendors.) But you can find yummy vegan desserts, juices, etc., and entrees if you want to pay more, can find the end of the line, and can stand waiting. The chef demo we attended was great, as was its food sample. But, again, 15-20 minute wait standing for your sample at the end? Much room for improvement, festival producers. I would not recommend this festival at this time. -- Chef Mary G."}
{"text":"Terrible. Spent $50 for my boyfriend and I to attend ($25 each). Thought he would love it since he is a vegetarian. As others have mentioned, venue was cramped. We purchased tickets on the day of the event, and it took us about 30 minutes to get through the entry line, even though there were only about 20 people in front of us. Most vendors were not offering samples.  Entry should not have been more that $5 or $10 if you have to pay for the food once you get in. Those vendors who did have samples gave extremely minuscule bites (barely a taste on a popsicle stick). Could barely walk through the event, and not enough restrooms/port a potties. Even the musicians seemed to be spending more time getting set up rather than playing music. My boyfriend did like one of the speakers who gave a talk on nutrition, and that was about the only positive. We stumbled upon that presentation by accident, as it was not clearly marked. Wish I could get my $50 back as it was certainly not worth it. Don't waste your money on this event."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that a lot of the problems I experienced at this event could be solved simply by booking a bigger venue.  That said, there were a number of buzzkills for me at this event.  Which is a shame because this is an event that should practically sell itself to valley foodies and the vegetarian/vegan community in particular.  This year's fest did have some interesting food offerings and unique vendors, but my two biggest beefs (okay sorry, forget I said beef) with this event came down to two main areas.  Logistics and value.  Neither of which I felt were in abundance this go around.

As with other food festivals I goto, I got there at opening.  There was actually a VIP crowd there at 10am, but I came with the general admission crowd at 11am.  I always try to arrive early knowing that the crowds will eventually swarm.  The VIP crowd this year was fairly substantial so there really was no avoiding the lines even at the general admission opening.  When 11am did finally roll around, the line didn't move.  Instead they directed everyone to get their armbands and check in.  Why Davisson Entertainment (the event's promoter) didn't just have everyone check in early and stroll in thereafter is beyond me.  But it was another 15 minutes before I finally got inside.

Besides a number of restaurants, caterers, and food trucks, the event also had clothing vendors, home decor vendors, live music, a beer garden, a kids play area and a cooking demo area.  While the variety of things to see and do were fairly abundant, the setup was really off.  This is where the venue problem comes in.  The main hub of the event took place in a narrow parking lot next door to the Phoenix Theatre and Art Museum.  On the side street next door were the food trucks.  Then you had to walk west through to the main courtyard area for additional vendors (assuming you could find the signs pointing you there).  In the courtyard area, there was a demo kitchen on your right (though you could easily miss it), and a REALLY narrow row of vendors stretching along the courtyard.  The biggest thing missing from this event is space.  Space for the vendors to form lines, space to move around even in the face of lines, as well as space to sit at a table and relax.

Let's talk about the value aspect.  $25 got me general admission to the event.  Having been to a wide variety of food events Downtown, I'm pretty used to an admission price of $25 getting me at least some inclusive items.  A few of the food vendors were giving some free samples (including a delightful Ethiopian sampler plate from Cafe Lalibela).  But most food vendors didn't have free samples and instead sold food items for an average of $5-$6 each.  Given that I only had $20 to spend, that was a disappointment.  The majority of food festivals I've been to are such that $20 would buy me enough food and drink to make me full and happy.  In many cases the price of admission buys some or all of the food I can eat.

What food I did get was pretty solid.  Among the food items I got were a raspberry lemon scone from Pomegranate Cafe, a Bao (or steamed bun) from Hot Bamboo, a cauliflower taco from The Coronado, and a ranch wrap from The Cutting Board Bakery.  My favorite was probably the steamed bun, which was more of a dumpling stuffed with a variety of vegetables, garlic, soy sauce, rice wine, and sesame oil.  There were other vendors that I would've liked to try, but by 12:30pm the lines were getting so long in so many places I had to pick and choose my spots.  And because of the narrow vendor setups, it was often impossible to tell where the lines began.

So to the PHX Vegan Food Festival organizers, here's my two cents for improving this event.  First and foremost, move the event.  Hance Park would be ideal as its just a few blocks away, has plenty of space for the vendors (and the lines that inevitably ensue), and could encompass all of them in one square space instead of separating them into 3-4 different spaces as it is right now.  Secondly, make the value of admission go farther.  I would even suggest raising the price of admission and tell all food vendors to offer at least one item as a free sample.  Or even offer an all you can eat admission option.  I can assure you many festival goers would happily pay extra for that trade off.  And lastly, put out more tables and chairs.  If you have the event at Hance, you'd have plenty of space for this and festival goers (particularly those that arrive in large groups) will thank you for it.

I sincerely hope the event improves.  I would love to try more of the tasty offerings, take more people with me, and discover more about the valley's vegan food scene.  I'm a carnivore, but I've had excellent vegan offerings throughout town.  Let's make sure this event is one that even more valley vegetarians and carnivores alike can partake in to enjoy the meat free wonders of the world."}
{"text":"Janelle at the VIP check in was amazing! Thank you so much for your help and with a smile!
The festival was amazing. If you are Vegan go if your curious go there is no loss. 
Maggi Vegan Jerkee is to die for try the hickory orange! I loved the yoga and shirt Vendors. I would recommend parking in the lot off Culver early get there early or you wont find parking. The first thing to do is get food the lines get long quick especially at Southern Fried Vegan!"}
{"text":"My wife and I attended. We were looking forward to it so much.   It was a nice day,  nice weather so at $50.00 for both of us,  we were okay - but just barely okay. A few suggestions for the event leaders: 1. Get a larger venue. The closeness of the crowd was very offsetting! 2. In addition to the marvelous local vegan restaurateurs, also approach national brands (Follow Your Heart, tofurky, Daiya, Morningstar, tuscon tamales, &c.) and have them attend.  3. Work out something different for people who pre-paid vs. those who need to purchase tickets at the event.  People with vip tickets were waiting in long lines with people who had not pre paid. I heard a lot a groaning about that.  4. Only offer vip tickets online.  As we were leaving after a couple of hours of standing because there was not enough seating,  my wife said \"Let's not go next year. That was terrible and expensive. Definitely not worth it!\" To which I replid: \"This is only the 2nd year.  People will give them improvement ideas and next year will be better. We'll go one more year. \"  PLEASE don't make a liar out of me. Learn!  You raked in cash at this event, but I won't pay that kind of money for the kind of experience you provided this year and I'll be looking very closely at everything next year before plunking down 50 to 100 bucks just to get in,  then paying for food and whatnot."}
{"text":"$30 entrance fee for what???
I just don't get it. The few samples there were miniscule. It was really all about buying food from vegan vendors. Ok, so why charge so much just to go?
Either charge an entrance fee and then have lots of samples OR don't charge to get in and sell food.
Plus, you got a token for a drink included with admission, but the wine was NOT vegan.  Does this make sense to anyone? Not to me!"}
{"text":"February 25, 2017, marked the 2nd Annual PHX Vegan Food Fest. This year, I bought VIP tickets. Luckily, I scored them for $25 (during an early bird special), which was 1/2 off of the normal $50 price tag. The biggest perks to going VIP are the dedicated parking lot and the early entry. The early entry alone is what kept this from being a 1-star experience for me. 

ENTRY: 
We arrived at @ 9:15am. There were no signs to indicate which lot was the VIP lot and which line was the VIP line. I parked in what I assumed should be the correct lot. Then we walked towards where others were already forming a line. After being in that line for 30 minutes, I saw someone bringing a cash drawer and realized it was NOT the VIP line. Apparently, we passed the VIP line on our way to this line but since there was no signage (and no one in line) we didn't know. Now, instead of being first in line, we were about 50th! *insert angry face* 

Entry was to be open to VIPs at 10am, and open for GA at 11am. As it got closer to 10am, I kept thinking, \"Why aren't they checking credentials early so we can actually enter at 10am?!\" Being that I knew how crowded it would be (VIP sold out, & eventually GA did too), I wanted to take advantage of that full hour, B.C. (before crowds)! We loss @ 15 minutes in the line. BUT because the GA entry lines moved thrice as slow, we actually had a little more time before the masses descended. 

FOOD:
Early bird doesn't always get the worm. Apparently, we were too early for several booths, who weren't ready to serve for one reason or another. Cafe Lalibela said they had to wait for the food inspector. Why wasn't the inspector there earlier?? 

Simon's Hot Dogs was ready, so we started there with a Colombian Hot Dog and vegan alfajores. Delicious, as always. Udupi's Gobi Manchurian & Potato Masala Dosai were perfect. Ike's Sandwiches came through with an abundance of samples of their Pilgrim: vegan turkey, cranberry sauce, sriracha, & vegan \"dirty\" sauce on Dutch Crunch bread. Southern Fried Vegan returned with their overpriced and overrated food (but, yes, I still bought that $15 bowl with ONE measly piece of a fried \"chicken\" strip.) Urban Beans' Jackfruit slider was amazing and only $5 for a large portion. 

Green made their vegan fest debut this year with 2 Curly Fry options (a curry flavor & an atomic spicy flavor) for $5. ALL, as in 100% of the sales went to the Humane Society! How generous! 

By the time we made our way back to Cafe Lalibela, they were already out of everything. They were only giving away samples at the fest; they did not offer any items for sale. 

After round 1 of eating then walking around, we were ready for round.  But by 2pm (festival ended at 5pm), most places had sold out of everything or most things. For this reason, we missed out on Positively Frosted Cupcakes, Mi Vegana Madre, that Lunchbox food truck, and many more. 

DESSERTS:
My sweet tooth was satiated thanks to Pineapple Dole Whip (Affogato truck), Vanilla Bean sorbet (LuLu's Sorbets), Snow Cones/Shaved Ice and Caramel/Kettle Corn (from newcomer, Kettle Corn Wagon), Keylime Cheesecake (Heather's Foods), and free cookies from Green. 


WATER:
More vendors sold bottled water this year, and the event organizers' water supply remained well-stocked. We received 2 drink tokens with our VIP purchase and used both for water. 



VEG FEST TIPS (for festival organizers & goers):

Because we got in early, and because I strategized (always hit up the Dole Whip truck and Southern Fried Vegan first, b/c their lines are ALWAYS the longest), we didn't have to wait in any long lines. Our longest wait may have been @ 5 minutes in the LuLu's Sorbet line. 

We also didn't have any issues with seating (again, due to VIP early entry). We got all the food we wanted to eat, then sat down and enjoyed the food and the live bands. 

Most vendors sold full sized portions, as opposed to festival portions. It's best to go with a friend and split meals. This allows you to save money while saving room in your belly to try more things. 

VIP is the best way to go, but it is NOT worth the $50 regular price. It WAS worth the $25 sale price. (I'll post a picture of the VIP swag bag and what was inside.) Follow them on social media for sale announcements. 

The festival needs to be free with a VIP option. 
It's done and it's successful in bigger cities, so... Although someone was bragging (author of WTF Food) on their social media about how the festival organizers put her up in a fancy room, so maybe this is where the bulk of the money is being spent?

The festival needs a bigger host space, but needs to keep the free parking. They also need a better check-in process so that the entry time is the time that people are actually entering.

Overall, I had a good time, thanks to the VIP ticket, but there is much improvement to be made."}
{"text":"I'm really, really torn.  This should have been a 5 star event.  Instead, it's more like 2.5 stars.
Let's talk about the pluses first. 
 I got 50% off discount tickets several weeks before the event, so I wasn't unhappy when vendors ran out of food.
The food offered was INCREDIBLE.  Some of the stars:  HUMMUS XPRESS, Ike's Love and Sandwiches, Positively Frosted.
There were cooking demos, good bands, great weather, and amazing smells.
Now, on to the bad.

The price to get in without a discount is $25.  No biggie, right?  Wrong. Almost none of the vendors were offering samples. What?  Not cool people! Some of them were, but the majority were not.

The venue was insanely crowded.  Beyond comfort, and there was no way to figure out who was in line where.

Several vendors ran out of food before 2pm.
Most vendors had run out food by 3 pm.

No where near enough trash cans.

Move the festival somewhere MUCH larger (at least double), and if the vendors aren't ALL going to offer samples, sorry, but I won't pay $25 to go ahead and pay for food I haven't tried first, in a place so crowded that people are snapping at each other."}
{"text":"I went to this festival for the first time this year and had a good time. I think the organizers may have addressed at least some of the issues that were present in previous years. 

There were a lot of free samples this year and I didn't feel like the crowds were out of control for the most part. The line was long for a couple of very popular vendors, but most of the vendors I was able to walk right up to or had only a short wait. You still definitely want to get in line early for the very popular food trucks/booths since they will run out of items before the day is over. 

I think the price of admission should be $15-20 for General Admission instead of $25 or they should include a couple more freebies with General Admission. I noticed a lot of the VIP bags were not even picked up by 4pm. Maybe next year offer free goodie bags to the first 500 people?

My favorite things were the Mustache Mocha from Pour Jo Coffee, the Soybean Bao from Hot Bamboo, the microgreens from YoBro and the cool vegan buttons sold  in the apparel booth. I do agree with other reviewers that the organizers should reach out to Follow Your Heart, Tofurky, etc. to have booths here and offer free samples and coupons. A decent amount of non-vegans also come to these festivals, so it's still worth it for the major vegan brands to be represented here. 

I also liked the location of the festival and thought it was a good choice. However, the recycling and trash bins were confusing to tell apart, so that is something that can be improved for next year. 

Overall, a great time though and I'm happy I  came!"}
