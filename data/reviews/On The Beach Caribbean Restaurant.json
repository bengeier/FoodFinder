{"text":"This is one of the best Caribbean food place in GTA. Beans and Rice with Curry Goat, Oxtail are really yummy, and is my favorite. The meat very soft, juicy and is so nicely (slow) cooked, that it comes out of the bones easily. The spices and sauces are mouth (and eye) watering as well as it adds to the kick :-)   I am fan of Caribbean cuisine, as this is a fusion of East Indian, African, Arab, Chinese and the European tastes. Traditionally these tastes were brought by people from many different countries when they came to the Caribbean, along with the people created styles that are unique to the region. Most caribbean dishes include rice, plantains, beans, cassava, coriander, bell peppers, chickpeas, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, coconut, and any of various meats that are locally available like beef, poultry, and fish.   Price is very reasonable and low that, they have daily specials every day for $4. It is much low cost than those fast food (read: unhealthy) chains, and you can eat very healthy food here."}
{"text":"Solid food. Don't normally rate my take outs, but the food was good. Solid portion of jerk chicken and rice for the price. Came with some potatoes and coleslaw as well. Would have been equally as solid without those  Would recommend for Durham area. Nothing memorable yet. Will be there for more."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here because I had a 20% off coupon. Everything started out good. Engaged in some light friendly conversation and was given a free sample of thier chicken dumpling soup. The soup itself was good and came with nice chunks of chicken and soft dumpling. Only complaint was how salty it was. After the free sample soup it just went downhill from there.  I presented the 20% off coupon and it seem like she didn't want to honour it but she said she would. I ordered a large oxtail and a side of jerk chicken thigh. On the menu board and on the coupon menu which I had, the oxtail was listed at $11.49 and the jerk chciken thigh was listed at $2.90. On the menu board in the restaurant the oxtail was listed at $12.  OKAY, NO BIG DEAL. I CAN LET THIS SLIDE.  When I get the bill, the oxtial was charged at $14 and the jerk chicken thigh was charged at $4. They explain to me that there was a price increase recently and they haven't changed the menu board yet. I also had to remind the person serving me that the meal comes with coleslaw. If I didn't remind him I would have never gotten any.  OKAY, NO BIG DEAL. I CAN LET THIS SLIDE.  On the bill it shows the following:   Large oxtail $14 Jerk chicken thigh $4 Total before tax $18 Total after tax and takeout fee $20.53  I ask the lady for my change after giving her a $20 bill because I'm suppose to get a 20% discount, which should have brought my grand total to $16.33 - she responds by saying, \"The total is $20.53 and I only charged you $20 so that was my 20% off discount.\"  Well obviously she didn't honour my 20% off discount and I was charged extra instead. I let it slide and did not object. I figure just ranting on Yelp should suffice.   Now to the food. I got the food to go and this place is only a 10 min drive to my home. Jerk chicken thigh was cold. Not even warm. Tasted good and meat was tender. The oxtail rice and peas was warm and came in a large portion. The meat was fall off the bone tender. The spicies and overall taste for the sauce was not caribbean style at all. Not spicy at all. Tasted like a bean paste sauce. I really disliked the sauce and it was all over the rice and meat. I forced myself to finish the meat but just couldn't finish the rice with that sauce all over it.   Food is a 2 star for me and the overall experience is a negative rating for me. The owners seem very friendly and are genuinely good people but I can't give them extra marks for such a poor experience. Thanks for the free sample soup but I can't recommend this place and will never return."}
{"text":"Came here on a friend's recommendation, after he had two back to back lunches of jerk chicken...best he's had, coming from a born and raised Jamaican boy visiting from Jersey. Had the large oxtail (with rice & peas, coleslaw) for $16.95 w/ tax.  Took it home and found the rice slightly undercooked but the oxtail was full of flavour...wish there was more! Looking forward to trying the jerk chicken next time and maybe even the breakfast combo. Rating would have been 4 stars if the rice was cooked through.  Will definitely go back. FYI, under new management and chef, now called \"Island Breeze\"."}

{"text":"Was passing through the area and saw this place.  My wife and I went in and were not disappointed.  The staff was very very friendly and gave us samples of certain dishes to try.  We eventually had the jerk chicken with rice and peas, oxtail with rice and peas and the goat curry roti.  They were all delicious and the price was fair.  Will definitely return whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The Jerk Chicken with rice and peas is fantastic!  I eat hear whenever I crave great Caribbean food.  The staff are always very personable.  They also off their own brewed authentic Jamaican drinks!  Overall a fantastic friendly environment that keeps me coming back for more."}
