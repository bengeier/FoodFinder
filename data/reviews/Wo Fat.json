{"text":"have eaten here over 10 times the only good dish is the roast duck and i mean the only good one. ive tried a few of the other dishes and either raw, overcooked, one time they didnt have the sauce to the strawberry chicken. the worst was fried rice the smell made me gag it was hard, i threw it away. my husband eats the roast duck, i go elsewhere. also the service is terrible, i call in our orders to be picked up, the girl on the phone never says the name of the restaurant, can i help you or thank you, good bye. she hangs up on me after the order. gets annoyed when i go in and ask if the order is ready \"i tell you 20 minutes, has it been 20 minutes no so go wait\". i wish i could find another resturant near me that served duck."}
{"text":"Great food. Ordered the Almond Crispy Duck. First time ever for me so I can't say whether or not it's better than others, but I liked it very much. Ordered General Tso's chicken...it's my standard for how good the chef is...excellently done. The vegetable chow mein was tasty but the noodles were over cooked. The mu shu chicken rivals what PF Chang used to serve, so I now have my place for getting mu shu.  Just make sure you review your order with the waitress before you let her go. They were very accommodating and checked a few time to make sure everything was ok. The reason for the three stars is because ambience is non existent. So go for the food and take home the leftovers...or order carry out. It'll be worth it."}
{"text":"Ginger chicken was delicious but was too salty! Chow fun and the fried pork was sooo delicious!! The boba drinks was really good too! I recommend the pineapple drink though! hahah"}
{"text":"Apparently the management has changed here. For the worse. Dosed with MSG, prices are higher, and service is sub-standard.
Such a shame, this used to be our favorite place for Hawaiian style Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad...the food was good & the service is excellent..They're are very courteous and respectful...the only bad thing is that it's in a crappy area & the shopping center That it's in is all Mexican..."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot of good things about this Chinese Restaurant so I just had to go. BIG MISTAKE!!!  While waiting to get my order taken, you could clearly smell the pungent odor of sewage. It was so strong that it made me gag! I immediately left and decided to cook at home. I was shocked at the patrons eating that didn't find the smell a problem.  #GROSS"}
{"text":"The worst customer service and lunch I ever had. From the reviews from yelp I decide to go with my husband for lunch. The server( May) was so unfriendly to us that should of been a clue. Seated us and the menu was a old plastic pic frame with the lunch specials. 
Decided to order the Chicken Low Mein comes with a small soup, rice and Chicken Low Mein. They  were ok. But the Chicken Low Mein had the nastiest over cooked noodles I have ever eaten in my life. Rice was ok could of been better. My husband didn't touch his plate and left the whole meal. 
So I said to May these noodles are nasty over cooked and she tried to explain to me that American people like those noodles kind of racist. So put the nasty noodles on the lunch menu and order the other noodles from the regular menu.
Trust me  take your $ and have a decent meal some where else. The place is out dated reminded me of the Chinese restaurants in New Jersey 25 years ago. I didn't expect my $ back but the food was disgusting and the service unacceptable."}
{"text":"Been going here since i was 5 love the egg drop soup great atmosphere im actually going to go tommorow for some soup love the egg drop soup love the food and the tea learned how to use chopsticks at this place lol"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good hawaiian chinese food then this is the place.  Coming from Hawaii, we are used to foods having a lot of flavor. A lot of the chinese restaurants here are very bland.  Another compaint I have with other restaurants is that they dont marinate their meats so the texture is not the same.  Anyway, the minute chicken cake noodle is the best ever here.  The mongolian beef is also very tasty and the ginger onion chicken is ono.  And dont forget the gau gee.  Its a Hawaii thing."}
{"text":"Came in to grab a quick order of Pot stickers. Got tricked into ordering a full order. Was never given the option of a \"half\" order. Will never come back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite Chinese restaurants in Vegas and when my brother visits from San Antonio it's a must . The crispy gau gee is very good. The soft gau with chow mein is also a must for me one of the few places in Vegas that serves this dish. 
           We also like the kau yuk with bun, it's like eating a deconstructed char siu bao , with pork belly.  We also had the stuff duck with barley and chick peas it was a little under seasoned . Mabo tofu not as tasty or spicy as other places.
          Overall still our favorite Hawaii style Chinese, they need to be a little more consistent."}
{"text":"as a Chinese, all I can say is:  Gross?
Their food are over priced and doesn't taste  at all! 

Totally Gross! Dirty, not many choices, taste like shit!

I wonder where are the good reviews from"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Chinese restaurant. The only item we did not like were the chicken wings my Son ordered. It's basically Chinese with a hint of Hawaiian, The food is good. The service is there just not that friendly, but getting better."}
{"text":"It was freezing cold in here! As soon as you walk in there was this bad smell. Ordered the Mongolian beef & beef broccoli lunch specials. Not our favorite. Left still feeling hungry so went to eat again across the street!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth a drive out. Very friendly staff but the food is average.  Its slightly better than Chinese food you would get at a mall but there are better places on Spring Mountain. Had the cake noodle which people rave about but its basically crispy chowmein. Had cold chicken which was ok if you like that. Had fried rice which was average. Big Wong is much much better and with better prices."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday, the Strawberry Chicken is AMAZING!! I highly recommend it. The restaurant has been here for a while and you can tell when you walk in. It wasn't too crowded and my group of 4 was able to carry on a conversation without shouting at each other. The service was attentive without being overbearing. I will definitely go back to this place!!"}
{"text":"From the reviews, we had to try the crispy kau chee, cold ginger chicken, and almond pressed duck. All delicious. The spot itself gave a SF hole in the wall feel that we like. Don't order the wine unless you like your wine sweet. Do get the salted duck egg and mix with your rice for added salty goodness. Worth the trip from the southside!"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. The food looked bad and tastes horrible. I won't go back,  I am extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the closet I'll get to Hawaiian Chinese cooking. Great spot for families and groups.  Your hole in the wall joint. We end up ordering the same thing every time ."}
{"text":"For those who used to live in Hawaii and are now in Las Vegas, this is the place that brings you back to home by their tasty delicious food. The owner is from Hawaii. He makes the best Hawaiian style crispy gau gee. 

The fried rice is always overflowing in the plate.  Their lunch specials are $5. They have really good Mongolian Beef. It's a little on the spicy side, but it's good.  This is probably the only place where I would eat my chow mein too."}
{"text":"For those of you who know good Cantonese food, this is not the place.  Using the old now gone Far East in Los Angeles as a base line this place falls way below expectations.  I has hoped for better but found their preparation wanting.  The search continues for great Cantonese."}
{"text":"Decent price but very nasty. People told me this place was good so me and family went to try out. Over priced. I love food but didn't like the taste of their food. Employees were very nice tho"}
{"text":"My home away from home.  No other restaurant in the US has crispy gau gee.  whenever I'm in Vegas, I'm gindin here.  Just a hole in the wall, but, just like the islands brah.."}
{"text":"I only come here for the minute chicken cake noodle, it's quite good, as long as you don't mind the bones.  Everything else is pretty much standard, yet adequate.  Just wish they weren't located so far away."}
{"text":"I've eaten the  Minute chicken with Cake Noodle, Crispy Gau Gee and Mongo Beef Lunch Special.  It reminded me of Chinese restaurants in Hawaii and it didn't give me diarrhea an hour after eating it so I'm ok with this place.  It's a little expensive and the portion sizes aren't as big as Hawaii, but I'll hit this place up if I'm nearby and need a little taste of home.  I would not drive out of my way to come here though."}
{"text":"I have soft spot for this restaurant as I ate at this place when it was originally in Hawaii. The food is old style Cantonese that reminds me of the old days. They even have \"Almond Duck\" which most Chinese Restaurants no longer serve. The Pork Hash is excellent as are the other dishes they serve. Great lunch specials too. Highly Recommended."}
{"text":"One of the only places left that makes the traditional Almond Pressed Duck.  FANTASTIC!!!

We also had the chow fun which was excellent.  Fast service, great food.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went in as a family and ordered family style. Tried at least 10 different dishes. By far my favorites were Lemon Chicken and Walnut Shrimp. I don't think these items can be considered dinner....so delicious could be dessert."}
{"text":"We stayed in Las Vegas for 4 days. How much buffet can one take?! So off we went in search of a chinese non-buffet restaurant. We came upon Wo Fat. I thought what a name!! I've been to old Wo Fat in Honolulu's chinatown. The food was ewwww yucky. So I was already concerned. We were a party of 8. 

We were in search of lunch. Plenty of parking. The outside looked like a down home unpretentious chinese place. I think the waitress was taken back a bit by the number of us. The waitress were really nice. Spoke chinese to my mom and sis. I had not much of an idea what they said by the end of it we had yummy food infront of us. The noodle soups are awesome!!! 

We went back a few days later for dinner. Lunch was better but dinner was good and filling too. They were accommodating to our less salt request. I think lunch for us was less than $60 for 8 people including tip."}
{"text":"Great food in a hole in the wall location.  Love the Shrimp with Honey Walnuts.  Nothing fancy buy tasty."}
{"text":"I've been here before, thought it wasnt bad.  I ordered the moo goo gai pan and asked for white sauce.  They put brown sauce.  I ordered it to go.  I went home and it was not good. The food tasted old. The pork fried rice was sooo greasy.  The egg drop soup had no flavor. So I took the plate back and I got sweet and sour chicken comped.  I know the lady in in her own native language wherever that may be cussed me out in the kitchen to the other workers!  I went home and I bit into a piece of sweet and sour chicken and was not good it was a tendon or something and they meat was chewy. That's cause I am preggers too.  NEVER AGAIN!!! I could see why the health dept shut it down in somone elses comment.  It seems like to me they are just ok with getting by.  Never will get better.  They say oh come back I make fresh food and talk smack behind your back when you get there."}
{"text":"Great employees, I order via phone and they always have the phone ready for pickup. They have a wide variety of options to choose from. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is good,  I get my whole duck from here.  If you eat in they only give you one can of soda which is weird, the whole fried fish is super not worth the money but the rest of our food was good a little higher prices than what it's worth but good"}
{"text":"Born and raised on the Big Island, the food serves here hits home! It's one of the few places that I frequent for \"home\" food. I frequent this simple hole in the wall restaurant frequently. Serves Chinese food (hawaiian style) and it is always hot, fresh, and very generous on portions. Crispy Kau Gee, Duck Egg, Porkhash, Minute Chicken, Hot and Sour Soup, Won Ton Soup, Shrimp Canton, and Tsing Tao are what we order almost every time. The staff knows us and our favorite server is Jeanette (chinese name is chu-tsing....I know I totally spelt her name wrong). The two regular female servers always give great service and it's nice to see the chinese cook come out to see his customers enjoying the food he prepared. The only reason why I did not give it 2 stars is because of the service we recieved a couple of times from what seemed like the owners or partners of the restaurant (middle aged chinese couple)- they come across as rude and hurried, like its a bother that you came-to avoid this when we see them and the two regular girls are not there we just turn around and leave or take it to go-if we are on our way home."}
{"text":"We have wanted to try this since moving here in 2013 sorry we did the wanting was better than the actually tasting.   

S&S Pork sauce tasted like out of a can.  The chow mein was tastless, it should have a flavor to stand on its own, the orange chicken was just ok.  Anyone know where we can find good Chinese here without going broke or having to eat at a casino.  Times like this I miss Fresno's Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago and just now submitting my review.  The food here is tasty, the service is fast and friendly, and the food was reasonably priced.  Comfort food that reminds me of the type of chinese food I can get back in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Have been going to Wo Fat since early 90s after moving to Vegas in the late 80s. Yesterday we ordered our favorites Soft Kau Gee Mein, Beef Chow Funn with Black Bean Sauce, Crispy Kau Gee, and my daughter ordered Stuffed Duck. Everything got out to us in a reasonable time, but the Stuffed Duck didnt come out so I reminded them, we had Stuffed Duck too. They kept saying, \"Coming, Coming.\" We were almost done with everything and it's been 20 minutes and the duck finally comes to the table. So my twin daughters were already trying to shred the skin from the duck and put some on their plate. I pulled the bowl towards me and tried to shred a thick piece of duck, but it wouldn't shred. I tried to cut it with the fork, but it wouldn't cut. I touched the duck, and it was frozen. I took it back to the host and told her the duck is cold, \"Here take it.\" Now this is what upset me, several minutes later they bring the duck back out in the same bowl and put it right in front of me while I finish up the rice. I told them,\"I don't want it, you gave me frozen food and you bring it right back.\" I left immediately, I will never go back as they tried to fix the issue by giving me the same frozen duck in the same serving bowl. I used to go to them when they were downtown in Hawaii back in the 70s. But never again. No Aloha there."}
{"text":"Wo fat is awesome! The best Hawaiian food in town. The prices are so reasonable and generous portions. My favorite server Jason has always been so friendly and makes my dining experience always a good time. They have lunch specials for 5.50 $. The crispy kau ghee is my favorite. They also have ginger chicken and kow yok with steam buns. The restaurant has been there forever and is a definite must try!!"}
{"text":"I come he quite a bit an the food is usually good but today was over the top POOR. What made me experience so bad was the cold ginger dish which I must have ordered twenty times before and always came out alright but to day not so much. It was RAW and I don't mean a little pink. The center still had a heart beat. I requested the dish to be taken back. When I received the new dish it was the same dish but with a few pieces taken out and slightly stirred around. Like it had been picked threw and just covered with a little more sauce. I was grossed out. I went to the bottom of the plate and STILL RAW.  Asked again for the dish to be taken back. This time when it came to us it was the same but the whole plate had been just thrown into the microwave. I did not touch it any more and I was still AWFUL plate of twice NUKED and sifted through chicken. DISGUSTING!!! It truly ruined my day. Then the check came and I was still expected to pay for the RAW TWICE NUKED GINGER CHICKEN. The waitress agreed it was really raw and explained that the chicken they used today was bigger. Ya so if you know that cook it longer DUH. I was so pissed I paid my bill and left. I was heart broken that a place I usually frequent had done me wrong. I feel sick to my stomach now and am really disappointed in you WO FAT. Minus Four STARS for serving RAW product and not having the decency to correct it."}
{"text":"For a quick inexpensive place for lunch I'd definitely recommend. The service is ok and the atmosphere is meh, I think they need some music or radio on while people eat. Overall I'll probably be going back again"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. Was looking for good Chinese food not from any franchise or over-priced places like PF Changs. The best, did I say the best lo mein I have ever had!!!! Fried rice, egg roll, egg flower soup came with all for under $8. Amazing stuff my friend had a bowl of the Wor Wonton soup. Outstanding! There were 3 of us and the bill was under $25, for dinner. And the place is clean. Do not pass it by. An absolute hole-in-the-wall that is clearly a diamond in the rough.  It is in a very old and tired shopping center but with what has to be low overhead transferred to cheap prices and amazing food. I am here for four more days and I will be back at least once more. A must visit when I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"We love this place been comin here for 15 years but the man server very very rude other than that good close to home HAWAII food we can get in VEGAS"}
{"text":"This is hawaiis version of chinese food and reminds me of home. Their food is delish and comes out quick. My favorites are the crispy gau gee cake noodles and cold ginger chicken."}
{"text":"The noodles were deep fried to a crisp, inedible. The sweet and sour pork was underwhelming, but edible. The fried rice tastes like it was infused with used motor oil. I am convinced that the general's chicken is just deep fried chicken sauteed in ketchup. It really tastes of ketchup and ketchup only. The hot and sour soup is just, well, nasty. Something in it literally tastes foul or off. The egg rolls, now I know they are deep fried, but this is like they fried it, then soaked it in a bowl of cold fryer grease until the delivery driver showed up. Tell the cooks to please not serve food they wouldn't eat themselves. It is obvious that nobody handling the food there gives a shit about anything. Really bad food."}
{"text":"Ive read the past reviews n decided to eat here. I honestly had better chinese food than this. Had some pork hash n it was so fatty and oily. Also had shrimp with honey walnut and the shrimp was way over cooked. I also had beef broccoli and it was not fresh broccoli it was the frozen ones that u buy in the bag n the dish served only 5 broccoli. Lemon chicken was so thin should of been called thin slice lemon chicken. Portion size were very small and the food was overcooked. The only positive thing I can say was the water service; the server made sure our glass was full. My husband and I are very disappointed. Will not be returning. Maybe thats why we were the only customers in there."}
{"text":"Came in with buddy around 9 pm on Saturday, we were the only customers in there.  We started with a fried won ton like deal (crispy Gau Gee?), tasted well enough.  They served the standard jasmine tea, I always like to chill on that for a bit.  I ordered the shrimp with honey walnuts - a little disappointed, should've been more creamy and crispy at the same time (a gnarly combo, and why I order it).  My buddy ordered the curry chicken, celery and carrot garnish was meager, the chicken, not all that exciting.  From what I've seen, there are only two ways to go with Chinese: fancy, upscale CA style or fast, tasty, cheap Chinatown New York style.  It's a harsh comparison, but this place isn't really either."}
{"text":"OK, so I'm biased. Eaten a lot of duck around town but this is my favorite. Best roasted duck won ton noodle soup...ever! Flavorful, crispy skin, perfect noodles...yummy. My other favorite that the rest of the table had was crispy kau chee mein w/cake noodles. Gotta go with the cake noodles. Good ole comfort foods."}
{"text":"Service is rude, hassle to serve you, no thank you for order just a rude look when you pay. Food isnt good. Poor service, bathroom dirty. Food was cold and waiiter said they couldnt help. I wont come back again. China Gourmet is better on Nellis."}
{"text":"Family run business established in the 80s I believe. Been a while since we were here and today they didn't disappoint.   The best roast duck in town.  Great service too.  We will definitely go here more often."}
{"text":"BEWARE!!!!!!  Wo Fat was featured on dirty dining on KTNV.  I went there last week with my mom to eat and that night we were sick.  I should have know because the food wasn't like it was before.  The fried pork chop was over cooked and the vegetables in our dishes didn't seem fresh.  The news report showed the food not safely being refrigerated and the restaurant used old outdated food such as the tofu.

{"text":"My wife and I ate here on on a cold Friday night. When we came, there were customers sitting down but actually waiting for their takeout hehe. I've heard this place is a hotspot for Hawaiian locals living in Vegas  who miss the good chinese food back home. This resto does remind me of the chinese restos back home in hawaii and the food is the same too which is great. We had the Beef with Vegetable Chow Mein ($9.95), Wonton Soup ($6.95), and General Tsao's Chicken ($9.99). The wonton soup was good. The Chow Mein was ok but Im glad they ask your preference if you want the sauce on the side (dry style) or wet. The chicken was best thing we ate. It was a little sweet and little spicy with a bed of steamed broccoli. I've tried this place before and had their oxtail soup and beef with bitter melon which were great.  I love coming here for the nostalgia of Hawaiian style Chinese food and will definitely come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Being a new-bee from Hawaii, this place came highly recommended by a Hawaiian islander.  It was just down the road so we thought we'd give it a try.  We've already been there many times and taken out a couple of times before I've been yelping so needless to say, we like going there.

We were welcomed with a bunch of \"hawaiian\" stuffs...signs that said \"Aloha\" and pictures of hula dancers (for all you Hawaiian Locals, it was Kim Taylor Reece pitures).  The staff was friendly and told us that the owner used to have a restaurant called \"Wo Fat\" in Hawaii but has moved here many years ago.  Unfortunately, I've never gone to the one in Hawaii.

Anyways, we ordered the house noodles with cake noodles (yum!), shinchoy (chinese sour cabbage) with beef, and cold ginger chicken.  We were very happy with the food.  We've also tried the orange chicken, lemon chicken, soft gau gee mein (house noodles with steamed gau gee), crispy gau gee, and kau yuk (these were on separate occasions , of course) and it was yummy!  

It definitely has a \"hawaiian spin\" as Lindsey S. describes and we were not disappointed at all.  Funny thing I've noticed is that every time we go there, there is always someone that is there who is from Hawaii.  I guess the \"pidgin\" and the hawaiian bracelets are dead give-aways!

The only reason I gave them 4 stars is that the restroom is \"eh\" okay.  If you don't have to go...don't.  If you have to...then don't expect anything grand!  Lots of parking and if you're craving something sweet after...there is a Baskin Robbins in the same complex!"}
{"text":"Oh yea Wo Fat is GOOOD. Whoever first told me about them in my pre-yelp days never told me they were this good but thanks Nik O. for jogging my faint memory of them and finally giving them a shot.

Don't be scared of places like Wo Fat, which give you the rundown feel, I use to but not anymore. How else would we know about Oyster Sauce Chicken http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wo-fat-las-vegas-2?select=JRUMn0K6eBpl6qbBv9HRPA#ZbfI5E_SlKq0fi3d5fkdNA Don't remember to get them with Cake Noodles, I did, but still very delicious without.  The portion was plentiful. One scoop of rice and lots of Oyster Sauce Chicken, my kind of rice to non-rice food ratio.

Service wise they'll bring out some complimentary tea and fell you're drink etc. It was OK nothing bad. Price wise they have some cheap lunch specials starting at $5.50. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wo-fat-las-vegas-2?select=JRUMn0K6eBpl6qbBv9HRPA#QtJ6ERMWPNyegVzjqH23gg All of the items are pretty reasonable priced. Interior is cluttered and kind of matches the exterior but does have booths and round tables to seat a good number of people and it did get a good number of people there the 2 times there.

I'll make it to this East Vegas location just for more Oyster Sauce Chicken. I want to also go back and try this Stuff Duck that I saw in the pics."}
{"text":"this place you strictly go for the food , not the atmosphere or service because quite frankly they are both a little scary in the normal world . The chinese food here is beyond YUM , it is Hawaii style and we have come here for years , its totally in the hood but so worth the drive . we get the crispy kau gee every time , the minute chicken and cake noodles is my favorite and the deep friend short ribs I think it is ?? the menu has alot of things but this is all i have tried I know what i like !!"}
{"text":"I totally love this place! If this was closer to where I lived I would probably come here at least once a week! That's how good this place food is!

If your from Hawaii this will bring some nostalgic feelings to your taste buds! The food here is on point! This is the only place I know sells crispy Gau Chee! If you come here you need to order it with the hot mustard and shoyu!

The location maybe difficult to find as it is sort of a hole in the wall type of restaurant.  It's not very large so seating is limited of it gets busy. Very basic dining area and feels very old due to the furniture and tables they chose.

Like I said food is wonderful here! The prices are not expensive! My favorite dishes crispy kau chee cake noodle, minute chicken, cold ginger chicken, and there spicy pork chop! 

Enjoy and let's get fat together lol"}
{"text":"The best Chinese Food I've had. Super quick. We ordered 10 items from the menu. The absolutely best was the salt & pepper chicken wings. The best!"}
{"text":"Was here for lunch again on 8/24/14.  Still very good.  Did the ownership change?  Maybe a new cook?  The food tasted a little different (but still good), and the presentation style of the dishes were also different.  But I still think that for \"Hawaiian Style\" Cantonese food, this place is very good.  And the prices have gone up a bit, but still very good.  For those of you who are interested this is what we ordered: 4 orders of crispy gau gee, one order of beef brocolli/cake noodle. one order beef gailan/cake noodle, fishcake with veggies, spicy eggplant with pork, kau yuk, pot roast chicken, harm har ong choi, and one other dish that escape my memory right now.  The purpose of listing all the dishes is to let you know that all these dishes were very good.  We ordered extra since my son drove home immediately to LA and took the leftovers with him."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food! Chinese food with a Hawaiian twist. They're crispy kau chee is my absolute favorite. They're pork ribs are so good too. The service was great, never let our water cups get completely empty. Extremely nice people."}
{"text":"Wo Fat-this is so upsetting!! 
Burned.old,little pieces of over crispy cake noodle. 
Never again will I leave this place without checking every single plate on take out orders.
U apologized and said comeback but I live 20 miles away from u. We always go here and yes I'll be looking forward to our free order of crispy Gau gee cake noodle. 
SHEEEESH -SMH"}
{"text":"For a while before my dad passed, whenever he was on the eastside of town, he'd stop in at Wo Fat for lunch. So, after my dad's urn was entombed at the Veteran's Memorial Cemetery, the family ended up at Wo Fat for lunch - because that's what he would have done if he were still around. 

Inexpensive and decent food. 

That's why he liked it and that's what I experienced at lunch that day. Pretty good service as well. I'm not sure if it was because they recognized my mom who would have always been with my dad - or if it's the norm however, the server was attentive, friendly and overall, pretty good. 

As for the food - we basically just ordered the menu. One thing about my family is that we not only like to eat, but we CAN eat. I tried and didn't mind every dish we ordered with the exception of the egg drop soup. I wasn't a fan of the soup and I normally like hot soups when it's hot out. There was just a flavor that reminded me of a chemical taste that didn't quite sit well with me. Otherwise, I ate too much and NO, I wasn't hungry a few hours later."}
{"text":"Wo Fat is a Chinese restaurant on desert in near bolder.  This would be the kind of Chinese food I'm use to from Hawaii.  We came for the $5.75 lunch special.  It comes with one choice that you choose from a list.  I got the sweet sour pork and my friend got the lemon chicken.  
You can choose from egg flour soup, hot and sweet soup, and wonton soup.  I got won ton and she got egg drop.  
She also ordered the sweet sour shrimp.  The sauce tasted watered down but not too bad not that thick sauce I'm use to.  
It was good for the $5.75 deal.  You can't go wrong with that. The customer service was great. Lots of parking.  The restroom was also the storage room but clean.  
I'm use to this type of Chinese restaurant back home.  Where it looks kinda sketchy but the food is good lol.
I would go back."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Cake noodles were excellent. I also had crispy gau chee & crispy duck wth wonton soup.

Definitely an interesting menu. 

Service was minimal, the lady waiting on me seemed unhappy. No refills on drink or any check back for quality. Fairly expensive for lackluster service. Steady late afternoon crowd, but not busy. Basic waitress duties should be performed, at the least, for $20 lunches. Will try again, maybe an off day or maybe I'll do to go. 

Food 3 1/2*
Service 1 1/2*
Ambiance 1 1/2*"}
{"text":"I've eaten here occasionally for years and always thought the food was good, especially the crispy honey chicken.  A while back we ordered take out and hubby went to pick it up. When he got home I couldn't wait to dig in to the wonderful honey chicken. When I bit into the chicken it had a funny taste and texture. I cut into a few of the chicken pieces and they were raw pink inside. Gross, not to mention dangerous. I called them and told the lady who answered that my chicken was raw. She said to come back and they would give me another order. So Hubby goes back and brings the raw one so they could see it. She tells him that it's not raw, it's supposed to be like that ( huh?) and that it was the sauce that made it look pink (huh?) So he comes home with a new order and they had put the sauce on the side. The sauce was cold and the chicken blah. Will never eat here again, if they don't know the difference between raw and cooked chicken. Also had the orange chicken a while before this incident and the orange sauce was very artificial tasting and  the sauce on their lemon chicken positively glowed neon. What poor quality! Sorry, Wo Fat - Aloha means Goodbye."}
{"text":"Yummy!

We live on the east side of town and there isn't an abundance of great Asian food over here.  When I found the Wo Fat, I was so happy!

While they are a bit pricy and don't deliver (grrrrrr, if they did, I'd be tempted to go five star), they are delicious.  I'm not sure what other reviewers mean by \"Hawaiian-style Chinese\" food, as I've only been to Hawaii once, but I have been to China a number of times and this is about as close as I've gotten outside of the Chinatown area.  The food is always hot, veggies are crisp, meat is juicy.  Their egg flower soup is the perfect way to round out a depressing day.  Portions are very generous and while enough food to make a family happy can run about $50 for dinner, I don't feel like I've been cheated.  There is always food leftover for lunches.

I've eaten my way through a good portion of the menu and like everything that I've tried.  I always go back to the standards - beef with broccoli, sweet and sour, etc.  Those are the things that make me happy :)

The lunch specials are great - but I don't often get a chance to have lunch there.  That is the only time I've ever dined in, as I live rather close.  Aside from that, get take out & enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were about to eat here at wo fat Chinese restaurant and the sign said they wouldn't be open tomorrow due to health violations. You read that right health violations. Unless you want to get sick and possibly die go ahead; if not, take your business elsewhere. I suggest big wongs, it maybe out-of-the-way but is much better food. Have a rice day!"}
{"text":"NEGATIVE 5 stars!  RAW sweet and sour Chicken and Ramen noodles fried that was supposed to be Chowmein!  If I lived near this place I would've returned with this overcharged mess.  Very unhappy!  Cannot post without a star that is the only reason I even chose one!"}
{"text":"Hawaiian style Chinese food!   

You might not see the Chairman of Iron Chef America in this place, because he's too busy playing Wo Fat on CBS, and no, this place isn't named after Steve McGarrett arch nemesis, but it does serve Hawaiian Sun drinks, and they make a killer crispy kau gee min with cake noodles!    

Wo Fat is located on the northwest corner of Desert Inn and Sandhill,and shares the parking  lot with the Marketon supermarket.  This little restaurant serves up Cantonese culinary style food with a little Aloha, and will make any local braddah or sistah feel less homesick for our old school Chinese fix.

Just like Meat Jun in Hawaii; Cake Noodles is pretty much a Hawaiian style dish, and if you mention this term to any other Chinese restaurant in Las Vegas, they would have no idea what you're talking about.   It's similar to Hong Kong style noodle, but thicker in structure, but has the same crispy outside texture as HK style noodles.    This type of noodle goes well with Beef Broccoli, Oyster sauce Chicken (I wish they made the Hilo style version of this), and of course crispy Kau gee min.   Also their cold ginger chicken pretty killer too.  Wo Fat also has a bunch of $5.99 Lunch and Dinner specials.

One thing, I really wish Wo Fat made some steamed rice cakes, and I wouldn't have to make a run to Los Angeles of them.  There only one place in Las Vegas that does it, and I'm not into paying 3.00 for 3 very small pieces.  Hint, hint Wo Fat...make it, and you will sellout on a daily basis.  It's pretty easy to store in the refrigerator and a little steamer would make it come alive.   Just do it, Please!"}
{"text":"Here's the kind of Chinese food you're used to if you come from Hawaii! We enjoyed the familiar dishes that we grew up with. Everything we ordered was tasty; however the kau yuk could have been fattier. We from Hawaii like our kau yuk with at least 50% fat. I know, I know...not good for the health. But once in a while won't kill you I don't think. And we haven't had this in decades.

Most dishes were under $10.00 but as you can see from the pictures I posted, it's not a huge amount that you get. If you order several dishes like we did (total of 4), then the portion sizes will be okay.

All in all, a tasty and affordable meal. We were able to take home the leftovers for tomorrow's lunch or dinner. I especially enjoyed the Crispy Kau Chee Mein which brought back memories of Hawaii. I think this is the only Chinese restaurant here in town that serves this dish just the way I remember it.

We'll be back to try their many other dishes, including the roast duck...yum!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a fellow co worker. So I decided to take a chance on it. Bad choice. First off the lady taking our order was extremely rude. We had questions about the menu and she wasn't very helpful and seemed like it was a problem we were asking. We had the Orange chicken which was not the regular orange we are used to. They have the sauce on the side which taste to me a bit like orange soda. (Weird) I also ordered the chow mien which I paid an additional $2 for. I took one bite and threw it in the garbage. My husband got chicken curry. Which is usually served over white rice and there is flavors of hotness you could choose from. I ordered and he says to the women number 7 and she replies with a yea I know I got it. But I never told her a # of hotness. The curry was not hot and was served with fried rice. I would not recommend this place to anyone! Just not my cup of tea. I don't know which was worse the service or the taste of food."}
{"text":"Wo Fat offers your usual Chinese Favorites and some Hawaiian Chinese Inspired Dishes that you won't find anywhere else nearby. 

We started with the crispy au au chee (Crispy pork dumplings). They were very meaty and were fried to a bubbly light crisp.

I tried the cold ginger chicken in onion sauce. I was surprised that this dish was served warm and not cold. Once you peel off the chicken skin and remove it from the bone THIS IS KILLER GOOD CHICKEN! Deeply flavorful and moist. Not over seasoned the chicken flavor comes threw, just DELICIOUS. The portion they gave me was very large and I had enough leftover for two large dinners.

I wanted to try the hard to come by CAKE NOODLES. My server spoke English but I had a hard time understanding her and I accidentally ordered a meal of chicken cake noodles instead of just adding on cake noodles for $1.25. Anyway the cake noodles are really delicious. They remind me of ramen but are more firm and have much more flavor like wheat. The noodles seemed slightly pan fried with crisp ends and even were more delicious on the crispy ends. What ever kind of chicken dish she ordered for me was also delicious. It was chunks of flavorful tender yummy dark meat chicken.

My husband had Szechuan Shrimp. The shrimp were cooked well and this dish was FIERY HOT as it should be.

This is a small not fancy restaurant. Everyone there seemed friendly and welcoming. Our order was prepared quickly."}
{"text":"Simple Hawaiian Chinese Ono grindz!  It's a little hole in the wall (so don't expect anything fancy) w/ great service!  I usually get the Kow Yok, which is a sweet & sour tender pork belly served w/ steamed buns, crispy Kau gee min w/ crispy fried noodle cake, & chow fun noodles!  Definitely cures my Hawaiian Chinese food cravings!

Support your Locals!  Eat Local!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese place to go in Vegas if you're from Hawaii! Everything is good here. Honey walnut shrimp is my fav!"}
{"text":"The honey walnut shrimp is onoz!  This is the closest your going to get to Hawaiian style Chinese food in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Just like home!! It's a bit out of the way, but this place is just like the ones I used to frequent when I lived in Honolulu. Nothing to complain about. Food was Ono and prices were cheap."}
{"text":"Mmmmm came here at the recommendation of a friend who said it's just like the food back home in Hawaii. I looked on yelp to check out the pictures and to see what people where saying and then drove down to place a order. 

It's smaller than the Chinese places back home but it has that cozy kind of feeling. I ordered the minute chicken with cake noodle. I wish that it doesn't cost extra for the cake noodle but it did, stir fry Chinese broccoli and the sample appetizer. 

Mmmmm the minute chicken came noodle was so good. They separated the sauce so the cake noodle would to get soggy on the drive home. The only thing I was disappointed in was that it seemed like there was more cake noodle than chicken & veggie, but other than that it was delicious. 

The Chinese broccoli was the bomb. Not too soggy and not too hard. Just perfect crispness. 

The appetizer was alright. The BBQ pork had sesame seed on it which is alright but since I don't like it and wasn't expecting it I had to scrape it all off but it was still good. The only thing I didn't like was the gau gee. There was barely any meat and was only skin. 

All in all it was very delicious and I will definitely be back. They had a location on hotel street in Hawaii and have their menu posted on the wall 

I noticed a lot of people commented in the customer service and being that this was my first time there, I had good service. The woman who took my order was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas recently for a business conference / seminar and my group and I were all craving Chinese food.  Another person in our group pulled up Wo Fat on Yelp and said it had the highest star rating that was closest to where we were, so off we went.

This place is quite run down and the service was cold, not mean or anything, just everyone working here seemed super serious.  At least they took care of business, took our order quickly, and said it would take about 15 minutes.  

We ordered 3 items from their menu:  Kung Pao Chicken, Beef Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce, and Beef Moo Shu.

Kung Pao Chicken -  It was just okay, and I didn't see any of the red chili peppers that I'm normally used to seeing with this dish.  It was also incredibly spicy and they used too much white pepper.  It was too over-powering for everyone.

Beef Chow Fun with Black Bean Sauce - One of my favorite dishes in general, and it was the best of the 3 dishes we ordered here.  The noodles were tasty, as was the sauce.  The cut of meat was okay; it sufficed for what this place is.

Beef Moo Shu - These were the smallest rolled up Moo Shu that I've ever seen.  They gave us 4 of them, so that was a plus, but the outer part of the Moo Shu was thick and had an odd flavor that I still can't put my hand on.  I say \"nay\" to this weird-looking and odd-tasting Moo Shu.   

There's no way the food here is worthy of 4 or 5 stars, it's good enough if you're craving Chinese fast food and it's served with icy service, but I won't be coming back here again.  I travel to Vegas more often now so I'll be trying other spots."}
{"text":"Crispy Gau Gee Mein / Cake Noodles devine!! there is no place where you can get this stuff except for some chinese restaurants in Hawaii.. 
This place may be the only place on the mainland that has this stuff..
and its too bad its here in Vegas.. if it was in San Francisco they would be making a killing.. 
For all of you who love Crispy gau gee Mein.. and cant make it to hawaii come here..
by the way .. we got fortune cookies..
the staff was also super helpful... our baby was crying and they volunteered to push the stroller until baby fell asleep!!"}
{"text":"AWESOME food just the way we eat m in Hi, kinda expensive but I recommend this place.  Only thing one waiter, I think he cooks too.  I wish it wasn't so far takes with traffic from N LV 30 min. Gau chi noodles delicious,  egg foo young too."}
{"text":"Ordered take out lemon chicken blah doughy!,sweet sour shrimp thick flour coating,  and 1/2 duck!!$36 barely eatable. Called to discuss with owner she comes on says we been here 26 years and wont let me discuss issue, No wonder not 1 table on Saturday night at 6pm!! Was good in past but this time no so!!!!  Hope they teach cooks to cook properly. Not Again"}
{"text":"This is like a dream come true...good quality chinese food with low prices!  $5.50 for the lunch special, which comes with fried wontons, pork fried rice, soup, and I got the best shrimp with lobster sauce dish ever!  The only downfall was I wish they would include more shrimp, but other than that, this has to be one of the best chinese restaurants in town!  I have been going here twice a week because it's that tasty!"}
{"text":"Outside of Hawaii, Wo Fat is the only place we have found that serves cake noodle.  We try to go everytime when we are in Vegas to get our cake noodle fix as we can not find it in California.  Other favorites include the cold ginger chicken, \"anything\" on cake noodle, stuffed tofu, roast duck....The staff was courteous and attentive to our needs....we will be back.."}
{"text":"So the first day that we came it was really delicious. The second time we went it was just so-so. My husband got roasted duck and that was pretty good. I asked for extra green onions on my fried rice and he acknowledged it but didn't actually put any in there. The bathroom is kind of gross but overall it's decent food. Sometimes the rice crispy and our egg rolls were greasy. My go to will be the fried rice as it has been sprouts in it and I love them."}
{"text":"Eh. With so many food options in the Vegas area, this one is a pass. I tried the almond chicken (very much not like the karaage, but more like cashew chicken) and the beef and broccoli plates. The meat was lukewarm and dishes flavorless. Very saucy, but more kinda a grease. I did however get lucky enough to chip a tooth on the fried rice.  I was also put off by the server disciplining what I hope was her child in the middle of the restaurant. Probably something to do at home or in the back. Makes for a very uncomfortable takeout experience."}
{"text":"Loved the food!!! Just like the chinese restaurants in hawaii...I will be back. Get the $10 per person family dinner, more bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Wo Fat(not the bad guy on Hawaii 5-0!) is the only place in Vegas to go to for some Hawaiian Style Chinese food since Noodle Palace(RIP) is no more:(

Cake Noodles are pretty good, so is the Crispy Gau Gee and the Salt and Pepper Shrimp. Go here for the food and not so much the service which can be spotty at times...ALOHA!!!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(59/365)"}
{"text":"This restaurants originally came from Hawaii! So that a plus for me because Hawaiian food is one of my favorites. I dine in with a friend and we were both greeted and ask to choose our own seats. The place was cozy very family owned. They had a very extensive menu and even out the wall too! I went ahead and ordered the mongolian beef dinner with came with the entree, pork fried rice, soup and a egg roll. Everything was good and very large portions. I will come back to try other dishes! Very good price too!"}
{"text":"Me & my other half eat a lot of Chinese food WoFat is my least favorite. The server didn't ask if we wanted drinks once we did get our beers she didn't ask if we wanted seconds. The prices are decent but it lacks flavor. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim.  Resturant was small, very well air conditioned on a hot day.  Very Clean. Ordered Mongolian Beef, came with hot tea and I ordered Spice Sour Soup.  The soup was very good.  The MB was good but I had to add a dozen spoons of Chili Sauce to spice it up.  It came with fried rice and I would have to say for $5.99 it was a pretty good deal.  The waitress was there when I need a refill and I have no complaints.  I would recommend this place for quick, reasonably priced Chinese food and I'll order something new the next time I go in."}
{"text":"Always delicious! My friend Pat (super Yelper with recognition that as a new Yelper I am unfamiliar with the right jargon so I apologize in advance) told me about this place a few years ago and I come every time I am in Las Vegas. If you live on the mainland now and miss Chinese Hawaiian food, you can get your fix here. I have loved lemon chicken since I was a kid and he has the best one I have ever had. Chicken is moist, breading is nice and light, not too much, and lemon sauce is good. My other childhood favorite is cake noodle and he has a number of options for your sauce. Oyster sauce with chicken and Choy is popular. Also the salt and pepper pork chops and crispy gau chee is good too. 

(I verified it) If you grew up on Oahu, and remember Wo Fat in Chinatown on the corner of Maunakea and Hotel St. This is the same family."}
{"text":"Hey i blinked and all most missed this place! Really hole in the wall..the food was just ok.. they had cake noddle, ginger chicken and Hawaiian style chinese food but not as good as Hawaii ! The service was good and we had twelve people and were seated right away.. there was only one other table on a Saturday nite at 7:30.?. but alot of take out orders! The food came fast and hot so we were happy, i would come back again but when you are in Vegas there are so many places to go..mmmmm"}
{"text":"hawaii style chinese food awsome im loving it fried gao gee &ginger chicken"}
{"text":"The bf was super excited they had a place in nevada that sells the real deal hawaiian  chinese food so we came here to try it out. I was sort of sicky so I ordered hot and sour soup which was pretty good and just the right amount of spicy.  The fried wontons were large and had lots of meat, which was a nice change from other chinese places which are usually full of fluff, not meat.  The main dishes was 1/2 a roast duck and chicken cake noodles.  The roast duck had crispy skin and good taste with medium amount of meat.  The cake noodles were okay. They were cut into the little squares and had good taste but did not wow me.  I'm chinese so it takes alot for me to be wowed by chinese food anyways.  I was hoping this place had rice porridge/congee for my sore throat ... but I stuck out with that one :(.  I thought they food was alright but decent food and okay prices."}
{"text":"So I guess they were on Dirty Dining a few months back, but hey they're open and must've cleaned up their act otherwise they wouldn't be in business so I guess it's a good thing this was made public so that they can better themselves and not let it happen again. Now that being said...

Interior-still not updated but was very clean, like a old mom&pop shop.
Service- was great! We got a pot of hot tea and iced water upon being sat so we didn't have to ask. Drinks were always refilled, food was quick and dishes were cleaned up quick off the table too. Plus the waitress was going around asking for address & phone # to send us coupons which I thought was cool.
Food- was excellent. It doesn't get anymore authentic then the Hawaii Chinese restaurants. No one in Vegas serves my 2 fave dishes like they do which is Kau-Yuke with steam buns & Crispy Gau-gee. I dare you to find a place and message me if you do lol

So don't let the bad news about them scare you off, I mean sometimes you gotta trip & fall to learn your lesson and become better for it."}
{"text":"We came to Wo Fat after our Doughnut Crawl near UNLV.  There were five and a half of us--one was a three year old who didn't eat all our goodies.

Nelson and Sylvia Q. had been here before, so they suggested some of the dishes that we ordered.  I can't say there was a loser in the bunch but I liked some better than others.

The spicy shrimp were good but they weren't spicy.  There were some jalapeño slices on top but there was no  spiciness to the shrimp themselves.  The crispy Gau gee was a winner!  What great flavor in that fried goodness.  We mixed the Chinese mustard with soy and dipped the Gau gee in that.  Great!  The pressed Almond duck was another winner.  I love duck and this was great!  The Kow yuk - pork belly - was very good and was not as sweet as the look of the sauce suggested.  Putting a thick slab of the pork belly in a bao and eating was very tasty.

I think this little restaurant is a place to which I'll have to return.  Perhaps I can get my hiking group to stop here for lunch on the way back from one of our hikes this winter!"}
{"text":"Got the Mongolian beef lunch special. Holy.... The sauce they used was a bit soupy and the oil used was starting to part the sauce and oil itself.... Really disappointed. It wasn't even spicy. I chose the egg drop soup, which is included with the lunch special, and I swear it tasted like it was out of a can. Felt like I can taste the aluminum."}
{"text":"While on our family vacay, my dad insisted our first meal be at Wo Fat!
We loved it and it was extremely inexpensive!

Pro:
Good food
Great customer service
Lots of parking
Inexpensive meals

Con:
None"}
{"text":"Don't judge a place by its looks... and let me tell you, I didn't!  I took my fellow yelper's advice and tried Wo Fat.

And the verdict is... It's no bueno.  Maybe I'm spoiled from growing up in Taiwan and lived in Southern California for 5 years... but this place just wasn't very special.

We ordered several dishes to go... 5 to be exact.  AND I have to say none of them were too good.  The waitress wasn't too friendly either...  Nothing special here."}
{"text":"Tastes like home!

The Crispy Gau Gee was perfect and delicious with the hot chinese mustard and shoyu. Cold Ginger Chicken was huge! Nice and light with that fantastic onion flavor. I added some of that to my congee the next day for breakfast. I ordered the Kau Yuk because other Yelpers had raved about it, but it fell short for me. The pork belly wasn't crisp, so it just tasted like really fatty char sui. The buns were delicious, as always. The chicken and vegetables with cake noodle was good but there was a lot of gristle. I don't mind me some gristle.. but this was a bit too much. I was disappointed that they were out of the pork stuffed bittermelon! Oh well... guess I'll have to go back again.. poor me =P

If this place were closer to home (and not in a slightly ghetto area..) I'd be gaining some pounds."}
{"text":"Chinese Food Hawaiian style!

I used to eat here about 2-4 times per week when I used to work and live right down the road.  You cant beat good $5 lunch specials. Love the crispy gau gee. Gotta dip it with Chinese mustard and shoyu. 

Favorite dish to always get for dinner is the cold ginger chicken.  The chicken is moist and the ginger sauce is to die for.  But your breath will be kickin afterwards, but its worth it.

Too bad this place isnt closer to home and not in a kinda ghetto area"}
{"text":"Health district got \"A\"on 12/5/16,very clean right now ,be safe,every body can go and enjoy the tasty food ?I so happy and enjoy my lunch,good severs,thank you wo fat,only one Chinese Hawaii food in Las Vegas .great ,wonderful,excellent!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's hard to review this place since I'm not real big on asian cuisine to start with.

It is a real hole-in-the-wall dive. about 10-12 boothes line the walls and 4-6 tables in the center of the very cramped space.

Their servers are very fast & friendly bringing out tea & drinks immediately and then the meal comes out in a very timely manor.

BE WARNED: Very large portions are served here.

I had the egg rolls,pork fried rice,sweet roast pork and sweet & sour chicken. 

We also ordered Beef Chow Mein but didnt eat it. It had very thick noodles a film of some very distasteful sauce & tough meat. Skip this dish.

Now the rest of it was great. The pork fried rice & sweet roast pork was the best of it. I liked the sweet & sour chicken but I would go pork next time.

I will have to try the spare ribs next time but this is definitely a take-out place unless you like close quarters which alot of people do.

There were 2 large parties here when I went, they seemed like regulars and really enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Chinese food that reminds me from back in Hawaii.  My go to place for won ton mein & ginger chicken."}
{"text":"The closest thing to Hawaii Chinese food. I love that everytime I come here, you always see the same people working. They all remember you and everyone here is very friendly. My favorite place for real Chinese food! You have to get the Kau Chee!"}
{"text":"I moved out here from Hawaii in 2008. I've heard of this place from numerous friends but never got around to driving out there. Today, I finally made the 35 minute drive out there and surprisingly the restaurant was empty. Lucky for me because I was able to come in and study the menu before finally deciding and placing my order. My husband is allergic to shellfish so we ordered very basic. We were pleased with what we ordered. Closest to Hawaii Chinese food restaurants! Not sure if I'd especially make the drive just for the food though. Definitely if I'm already in the area! Very friendly and helpful service! :)"}
{"text":"its a bit out of the way, but like Big Wong, it has a menu full of comfort foods I grew up with

décor is a bit like some of the restaurants you would find in san Francisco Chinatown

menu is mainly Cantonese dishes, with quite a few Chinese-American style ones that could have come straight from the movie \"A Christmas Story\"!

my family ran a Chinese American style restaurant when I was young, so although it's not really Chinese food, I will order some of the dishes like shrimp foo young, almond duck, and shrimp Cantonese just to reminisce :-)

other than that, they do have some of my go to comfort dishes like bitter melon (which I despised as a kid), won ton soup (pretty good version), roast duck, etc.

I do enjoy stopping by here when I am on this side of town.
pretty fast service, not real expensive!

I know they run lunch specials, but normally don't order those..."}
{"text":"Those of us from Hawaii taste the difference between mainland style and \"local style\" Chinese food.  These cooks are definitely from HI.  All the sauces, broths, and recipes are so familiar.  Warms the homesick soul."}
{"text":"Extremely horrible customer service. & the food is just as bad. My gf & I came here for dinner & when we walked in there were 2 other families waiting to be seated as well & no one is in the restraunt; me & my gf stood for about 5 minutes before the worker yells over to us all & tells us to seat ourselves. We did. Waited about another 10 minutes before water was brought to any of us. 2 workers both talking in their foreign language & looking at us all. About another 10 min past & were all ready to order, then walking in is a \"oriental\" family; immediately they were greeted & seated. Waters instantly. Server is chatting up a storm with them & stayed by there table until they were ready to order. After waiting over 20 minutes we were finally being asked what we would like to order. Food comes out, we ate, paid the bill & left a $13 tip with cashier; as we were trying to leave the server blocks us from leaving the restraunt & tells us thay we couldnt leave without tipping him.... WTF. He started yelling at us, slamming the tray on our table, saying where his tip. First of all i do not need to tip no one if i dont want to. Tips is out of courteousy due to the customer service received. We told him that the tip was left with the cashier, & his response was that we tipped her not him & we have to tip separately. No the f@#k i dont.. all in all if u like bad service & crappy ass food then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I was determined to visit Wo Fat because of its Hawaiian-style Chinese cuisine. For that reason, it wasn't difficult to convince my family to come with me. We all loved and constantly crave the Chinese dishes from our past. Although I have come to love the Chinese cuisine offered in Las Vegas, it's just not the same. Anyway, the real reason I wanted to come? Four words: Crispy Gau Gee Mein. We ALWAYS ordered it at our favorite Chinese restaurant in Hawaii and it's been over a decade since I've had it! 

It was quite the drive for us (as is most places) and we were starving by the time we arrived. It's a small restaurant with just 3-4 large round tables and approximately 10 small booths. Fortunately, one of the large groups were leaving, so we didn't need to wait long for a table (there's really no where to wait except outside).

With five of us dining, we shared Lo Mein, Shrimp & Broccoli in Black Bean Sauce, Chicken Chow Mein, Combination Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken, Mapu Tofu, and two orders of Crispy Gau Gee Mein (substituted with Cake Noodles). All the dishes, with the exception of the Lo Mein (I didn't try it) and Crispy Gau Gee Mein, were only okay. The Chow Mein and Kung Pao Chicken were terrible. The Fried Rice has a very distinct flavor that really took me back to my youth, however, the quality left something to be desired. The Black Bean Shrimp and Tofu dishes were better than the rest of the group, but nothing great. 

The Crispy Gau Gee Mein, on the other hand, YUM. The Gau Gee is perfect..exactly how I remember eating it in Hawaii!! Crispy exterior with delicious, moist pork interior. So good. The vegetables, gravy, and noodles were harmonious. It's a popular dish and I absolutely recommend it. Although, it is a damn shame that it doesn't just come with cake noodles since that's the best way to eat this dish (don't forget the additional charge).

Oddly, the rice wasn't very tasty either. My favorite part of receiving steamed rice at Chinese restaurants is the delicious, fragrant Jasmine rice. Their rice seemed like it was just a long grain white rice, but my parents thought it was an inferior Jasmine rice. Either way, not yummy and disappointing.

Service was nothing spectacular and there were young children running in and out of the kitchen. Not very professional or sanitary. Nevertheless, we all thoroughly enjoyed the Crispy Gau Gee Mein, but it was unanimous that a second visit would be unlikely. If I'm ever in the area, I may consider a takeout order for it though."}
{"text":"This is one of the better mom and pop restaurant's in town.  I really like the food, the customer service and the atmosphere.  I used to come here all the time.  I eat here much less frequently since I moved to a different part of town.  The orange chicken they serve here is very unique.  It's just like eating a fillet.  This is a very traditional style restaurant.  I would prefer this place over panda express any day if the week."}
{"text":"So having been back to Vegas several times, I have had a chance to try this place again. It must have been the dishes I ordered because since then the food I've had has been really great.  Instead of my usual gau gee mein and stuffed duck, I've ordered the minute chicken cake noodle and pork hash.  The cake noodle is just like home, and the pork hash is the BEST pork hash I have ever had at a Chinese restaurant. Super juicy and fatty - perfect on top a huge bowl of rice. I loved it so much, that I ate it twice over a three day trip on two different trips."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and ordered Kung Pao chicken. Possibly the worst I have ever had. No taste, too much celery, and in a brownish sauce. Fried rice and hot n sour soup were ok. Won't do this again."}
{"text":"Omg worst phone service ever. Planning a party for my little girl and wanted to cater food. Lady that answers won't tell me how much a party platter cost, tells me she is busy, and hangs up on me. I call back to speak to a manager and she hangs up on me again. I hope the manager reads this message bc that was just simply terrible service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed to read the other reviews to find out that they were featured on Dirty Eats because the food here is so damn good!!! If you can look past the fact that the restaurant is well overdue for renovation, was featured of Dirty Eats and want great Chinese food, check this place out!

Cold Ginger Chicken is like I've never had anywhere else, Spicy Shrimp is amazing and the Hot and Sour Soup is my favorite in town! 

I give this restaurant 5 stars based on the food, 2 stars for service because the employees can barely speak English and ordering is very difficult. And a 3 due to the restaurant itself. It really does need an update, the old furniture and tables make it look dirtier than it is!"}

{"text":"This place serves good food, but the ambiance could be improved a little but. I recommend the moo shoo pork and it's unfortunate that you wouldn't know how great their food is from the look of the place."}
{"text":"I decided to take a chance and try their food today after reading the reviews and checking their most recent inspection which was in December 2011.  They had an A grade with 8 demerits after being reinspected.  They had a C grade with 38 demerits in November of 2011.  I learned this information from dirty dining.

When I first walked in the place looked decent and the person who took my order seemed nice enough but I didn't like the food.  I ordered my favorite Egg Foo Yung.  When I cut into the patties the first thing I saw was large pieces of egg whites.  The rice was under cooked, the gravy tasted watered down, and the bean sprouts tasted like they just were just poured out of the can.  I fix better egg foo yung then this place.  There was very little taste to it; I was very disappointed.  This is so far the worst that I have had since I moved here to Vegas about 4 years ago.  This is just sad :(

I would not waste my money on this place again trying something else on the menu."}
{"text":"Very, very authentic.

You can tell from the menu and the specials that they cater to real asian cuisine and not just the sweet sour port / chow mein / fried rice crowd.  The real food here like the salt baked chicken, the spring chicken, the bitter melon. Man this is the place to get real food like as if you were in Chinatown San Francisco.

Great Cantonese food, which means the rest rooms however, are terrible."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian style Chinese in Vegas. Been going to this restaurant since at least 2004 and will continue for as long as we can."}
{"text":"Skimming through my Facebook news feed was a very effective way to get this place on my radar. One of my high school classmates checked into this place and captioned it with, \"Hawaiian Style Chinese food.\" From that point on, I was sold. It wasn't too far from my house and my body was telling me it was time to eat. As I researched this place on my Yelp app, I realized that this place sold cake noodles, a dish reminiscent of my childhood days. Boy was I excited.

This place is located on the corner of  Desert Inn and Sandhill, which means from the 95, you'll have to take Flamingo or the Boulder cutoff and travel down Sandhill. This restaurant sits in a shopping center full of mediocre businesses, not too exciting of a location. When you enter, you think very outdated. Booths and round tables with lazy Susans tell you this place needs a renovation and fast! What calmed my initial nerves was the fact that they do their best to hold the Chinese traditions AND seem to cater to the Hawaiian population. Hawaiian drinks, signs with \"Aloha\" and \"Mahalo\" display their windows and counters. Did I really hit the jackpot?? When talking with the employees, the young lady said her uncle has a Wo Fat restaurant in Honolulu and this is another location. The staff was super nice. Even though I ordered my food to go, she still offered water to me. The food also came very quickly. Speaking of which, here's what I got:

Crispy Gau Chee Mein with cake noodles for around $10: THE REASON that brought me here and the reason that will keep me coming back! As a base you have the delicious cake noodles that remind me of my childhood. Crispy noodles cut into cake squares, topped with Gau Chee, oyster sauce and lots of different flavors and textures: char siu pork, shrimp, chicken, broccoli, Chinese peas, water chestnuts and mushrooms. WOW, what an array of flavors! So delicious and something I highly recommend! The cake noodle managed to maintain is crispiness, even with the oyster sauce. I was in heaven.

Kow Yok for $9.25: Kind of weird that they spell it like this. In Hawaii, it's referred to as Kau Yuk. Whatever the spelling, it's basically pork belly cooked and flavored with a fermented red bean curd. PLEASE BE ADVISED, this is a super marbleized dish. The fat can be very over powering for many, so don't order it if you're not into that. For me, it's what I grew up with! The flavor was just right. The pork had a good combination of fat/meat ratio. 

Crispy Gau Chee order (6) for $6.25: Another form of spelling I'm not used to. In Hawaii it's Cripsy Gau Gee. Basically pork stuffed won ton rectangles and deep fried, served with a spicy mustard and soy dipping sauce. This was ON POINT! Perfectly cook, super crispy and the port was flavored well. Add in the mustard sauce and you've got a side dish fit for a king! You definitely have to try this if you come!

Oyster Chicken for $8.95: Roasted chicken topped with an oyster flavored sauce. I thought the sauce was great and really helped to enhance this dish. My only gripe about this dish was the cut of chicken. It's Chinese style and cut like a roasted duck dish, meaning the cut bones and all. Although this is a Chinese restaurant, I don't necessarily think it's a Hawaiian style dish. What I'm used to is boneless, breaded and fried chicken with the oyster sauce drizzle. The flavor was good, but for some reason I wasn't as crazy about this dish as I was about the others. 

FINALLY! A Chinese restaurant that reminds me of home! There are a lot of Chinese joints in Las Vegas, none like this. The cake noodles alone are reason to come back. Add the crispy gau chee and I've officially found my new favorite joint! On my next visit, I'm getting the cold ginger chicken. I can't wait for that day to come. Thanks so much for the awesome food!"}
{"text":"When we used to live closer this was our go to chinese spot. To be honest we stopped coming because the service and a particular waitress was just so rude. Happy to announce the salty gal is gone! We've moved closer to galleria and that's one of the reasons it's been a while but something about Hawaiian style food is just comforting. Ive spent a lot of time in Hawaii with family and the food there is different. Everything is island style and wo fat is just that. Island style chinese food. Lunch specials are pretty good with decent portions. I love the cau gee and the oyster sauce chicken. Whole crispy chicken smothered in a savory oyster sauce. Other go to items are cold ginger chicken a local favorite in Hawaii. This last visit we ordered the Mongolian beef which usually I like but I wasn't a fan of it here. Don't let the neighborhood or interior scare you. Wo fat is a LOCAL favorite."}
{"text":"I'm about a 3.5 food wise, but I will round up since there were a couple of solid dishes here.

The reason I would come back here :

Pressed Almond Duck. This was VERY good. It is served boneless and has lots of flavor combined with the slightly sweet almond topping. The highlight of my meal!

Beef Chow Funn in Black Bean Sauce. This was pretty good! Tender beef with a nice flavorful noodle and sauce. Yum :)

Spicy Shrimp in Shell aka Salt & Pepper Shrimp. These were what you would expect, just not spicy at all. Good version of this dish. 

Kow Yuk (Pork Belly) served with Bao. This was tender and flavorful, but not sweet or sour like the color may suggest. It was good but did not impress me as much as my lunch mates. 

Crispy Kau Chee. Filled with a meat combination...similar to a crispy wonton of sorts.  Not bad.

Crispy Kau Chee Mein with Pork, Shrimp & Veggies. This was ok. Decent flavor but it was not extraordinary. 

Good Chinese spot in town, but I wouldn't travel across town for it again personally."}
{"text":"Oh God how I wish we had a Wo Fat in L.A....
I heard all about this Hawaiian/Chinese restaurant and the next time I was in Vegas I knew I had to go there for my beloved cake noodle and crispy gau gee. I was NOT disappointed. The whole restaurant itself is very comforting. No frills, no fancypants menu, just good cheap food. I ordered the oyster sauce chicken cake noodle and my friend ordered the beef broccoli cake noodle, and we shared the gau gee. We were happy f****** campers, let me tell ya. YUM!
I am threatening to come here every time I go to Vegas."}
{"text":"Oh boy, finally! I have been searching Las Vegas for a yummy, NON-buffet Chinese restaurant for 2 years, and I finally found it!

Wo Fat's dining area looks just as I'd want it to look: cozy, simple, to-the-point. Immediately upon seating ourselves, we received waters and a complimentary pot of tea. The menu consists of all the Chinese staples, plus a few dishes with a Hawaiian spin. I, myself, opted for the dinner plate, which includes rice, an egg roll, your choice of egg flower, hot 'n sour, or won ton soup, and an entree, all for $7.25. I chose the curry chicken, my friend the chicken lo mein, and my other  friend went with the Mongolian beef. We all sampled each others dishes, which were absolutely YUM. I tried my hardest to save a little of my chicken and rice for lunch, which wasn't THAT hard to do, since the portions are gigantic.

I am so happy now. Wo Fat, you_complete_me."}
{"text":"I've seen the mixed reviews.  Let me start by saying this really isn't your typical Chinese restaurant.  This would be considered to be Chinese food, Hawaii style.  All of us who grew-up on Chinese food from Hawaii will step in and feel at home.  Most of the best places were hole-in-the-wall-hard-to-find but had the best food. Please don't judge this place too harshly because it really does cater to us relocated Hawaii locals. 

Everything that I have ordered here brings me back to the Chinese restaurants back home.  They have specialties here that others in Vegas don't have.  Cold ginger chicken, cake noodles, crispy gau gee...I'm in HEAVEN!  My hubby's favorites are the honey walnut shrimp & the lemon chicken.  Both are very yummy!

It may not be much to look at and it may not be the \"best\", but for me this place definitely brings me home, just for a bit."}
{"text":"Cheap chinese hole in the wall kind of place. That means it's just my kind of place.

I love coming here. It's quick, easy, and delicious. I have yet to eat something on the menu that I would not eat again. However, I am working on eating the entire menu."}
{"text":"Food is ok but the people are rude. Try using  a debit card for under 10.00 they act like you did a crime. I'll take my business  elsewhere"}
{"text":"I love it here the food and service went in and was seated right away both the lady and the guy who brought our food were great and nice greeted us nicely and always checked in on us to make sure we were comfortable and provided everything we needed. I loved that the food took a little while because it all came out piping hot I would definitely recommend and come back. Was never rushed during our eating and we loved the set up of the place and menu. Very clean and maintained. Added bonus is their is a customer bathroom and high chairs available. PS the restaurant is originally from Hawai'i definitely gave me Hawai'i Chinese restaurant vibes Tasty definitely will visit again MAHALO"}
{"text":"Dining at Wo Fat took me back to my youthful years. The original Wo Fat was located in downtown Honolulu. The family brought the same entrees and style of cooking the best Chinese cuisine to Las Vegas. 

Our group took up four of the large tables in the dining room. We had ginger chicken, kau yuk with buns, crispy kau gee, cake noodles with veggies, pork hash patties with and without egg, steamed rice, and a bunch of other dishes.

None in our party left the restaurant hungry. We all ate, ate, and ate. 

Definitely recommended to all \"locals\" from Hawaii that long for the ono style cooking of home."}
{"text":"After passing by this spot for what seems like forever, and hearing positive reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I decided to piece meal it, and in hindsight, ordering the family dinner might have been slightly cheaper. Regardless, I ordered the General Tso's Chicken, Shrimp Fried Rice, and Chow Mein Combination. 

The food was decent. The Generals Chicken was alittle different than I expected and had a thick bright red glaze. The glaze also had a \"ketchup like\" smell to it when I first opened the box. Thankfully it didn't taste like ketchup, rather the sweet orangy-ness of any other General's Chicken, with a bright spicy flavor. The shrimp fried rice was your basic SFR, with plenty of egg, veggies and sprouts. Not much shrimp, and it was the small 20-30 type of shrimp and they tasted watery, as if to suggest it was previously frozen. The combo noodles had pork and chicken as well as the aforementioned shrimp with a sweet gingery flavor.
It was a fairly decent experience, and it reminded me a lot of the old Cheng's Express on south rainbow. The service was pretty lackluster. The lady had a weird attitude problem, even another customer asked if she was ok. She also rushed me through my order, which caused me to forget I wanted Orange chicken. I don't know if it means anything to her, but that's 10 additional dollars I would have spent. I don't know if she was at the end of a long shift, but it wasn't the best experience. When she handed me my food she was a lot nicer, and smiled even. All in all, I'd come back to this spot. It's the only one like it I've found around here.

3.5/5"}
{"text":"Since, I had a very bad experience with the other Chinese place, I decided to try this place.  This place is pretty good. I usually like to take my food to go.  BUT, I chose to say and eat inside the restaurant.  It was ok.  Definitely a \"hole-in-the-wall\" restaurant...LOL!"}
{"text":"The best place for real Hawaii style Chinese food. Been here in Las Vegas for 23 yrs and this is the only place I get my Chinese food from. I even go as far as taking the bus there and it's worth the bus ride."}
{"text":"Items selected:
Pressed Almond Duck
Kow Yok / Khau Yoke with Bao
Spicy Shrimp in Shell
Crispy Kau Chee
Crispy Kau Chee Mein with Pork and Shrimp
Beef Chow Funn with Black Bean Sauce

Having heard things both interesting and exciting about Wo Fat and its Hawaiian influenced Chinese cuisine but not yet able to coax a large enough group to make the visit worthwhile it was with great fortune that following donuts I not only managed to gather five co-diners to experience the small East side restaurant, but that two of the folks involved were already familiar with not only Wo Fat from a prior visit, but also the restaurant's style from their years in Hawaii.  Located in a less than ideal location and not particularly attractive from the outside or within it should suffice to say that a visit to Wo Fat is based more on the food than the ambiance but with service friendly and efficient throughout the off-hour it was with tea and water that the meal began, soon to be followed by a half dozen menu selections - most novel, all well prepared, and a few truly outstanding.  Sampling far and wide with suggestions from everyone including our server it was with plethoric portion that each dish arrived and with both the pork and shrimp stuffed kau gee as well as the beef chow funn excellent while cake noodles and shrimp were commendable if not memorable it was in the pork and the duck that the meal truly shined - the former a complex sort of mild char sui with more aromatics and less sugar proving irresistible on soft bao while the later was simply divine, a tender confit of duck beneath crackling almond paste that added just a touch of sweetness for a mere $9.95."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant owner is from Hawaii, so a lot of the Chinese flavor still tastes like it's from Hawaii. When I go here I ALWAYS have to have their Hawaiian crispy Gau Ghee. They always serve cold Ginger Chicken. Their Managua is ok, not like Libby's Manapua in Hawaii though. Eating here gives you that little bit of feeling like you're back home."}
{"text":"I remember the 1st time i had Wo Fat. They could tell i needed help with the menu. The Waiter didnt get frustrated he walked me thru the menu and suggested his likes and dislikes of food. They brought out Hot Tea immediately and Won Ton Soup. My Fav there is Lemon Chicken with Fried rice. And you cant beat the Lunch Special which they havent raised the price to much over the years. Its still a good deal. And comes with a Entree, Wonton or Egg Drop soup and Rangoons."}
{"text":"Wo Fat, how I wanted to love you!

Many of my Hawaiian friends say this is real Chinese-Hawaiian food.  Maybe my problem is that I always go expecting the Chinese food that I grew up with (New York style).

The staff is friendly.  The restaurant itself is a whole in the wall.  It isn't as clean as I would like but it isn't gross...

The prices are very reasonable.

My problem is just that the food isn't what I, expecting and therefore doesn't taste right to me.

I'm giving it three stars, but if you are judging it as a Chinese Hawaiian restaurant it may be worth more stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great customer service ! Love their tea btw! Price is reasonable. Apparently Yelp told me my review is to short so I'm going to make it longer but by the time I think of something else I already made this review long. Okay bye!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese food, but Hawaiian style. Seems it's a bit like home more than a lot of the Chinese places we eat in Vegas. The flavors are spot on, the veggies they add are like you would expect so no surprise substitutes. 

With family in town, they wanted to try some Chinese and this was our choice. We ordered family style and a lot, we managed it eat most of it, but still took home some including the rice for late night snack, (who wants to cook rice). 

Anyway, we definitely enjoy it here, and know it's worth going again. Crispy gau gee rocks!"}
{"text":"We will go back. The orange chicken a little different than wha in use to but my Husband really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Cut to the chase--
Food 4/5 (Chinese food Hawaii style)
Service 2/5 don't come here if you want any kind of special treatment...it's the kind of place where they throw plates around and just don't give a rip of how they treat you.
Cleanliness 1/5 place is dirty...not roaches dirty but sticky and dusty type dirty--this place is a hole in the wall with absolutely no frills!!
The only upside to this place is the food is prepped really tasty and portion size is decent.  It's a far drive but we come out maybe once a month just cause the food is good and not \"haole-style\" Chinese.  I just wish they would clean up their act and restaurant to be more service friendly.  Recommendations: Ginger chicken...pot stickers....garlic spare ribs....kau yuk...gau chee mein with cake noodle."}
{"text":"Law Vegas has extraordinarily diverse culture and cuisine piled literally on top of each other and Wo Fat restaurant clearly fits that description.  The restaurant is located in a diverse cultural area of Latin, African-American, and older established Anglo neighborhoods.  Yet, this Chinese restaurant with profound Hawaiian influences seems to thrive.  

There is no question that the physical restaurant is in need of a major comfort makeover ... but I've come for the flavors, spices, and combinations thereof that I overlook minor discomforts.  

The Sunday evening we visited the restaurant it was packed with mostly large parties of extended Hawiian families.  It was loud, crying children, balmy laughter and unthrolled conversations; just what a \"family\" Chinese restaurant should sound like. Not even sure we were below maxium seating compacity. 

Take care when ordering normally spicy dishes to express your desire level of heat.  Recommend you order to side of caution; Chef was a little heavy handed.  Nice thing about small restaurants food come out hot; bad thing food comes out when it is done even if not all of the orders are done at the same time.  My suggestion ... Learn to share!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful, about as good as it gets for Las Vegas. I know they have had their problems in the past, but hopefully they have rectified all of their issues. You can't beat the taste for the price anywhere in Vegas, very inexpensive, really good."}
{"text":"Out of all the Hawaiians you can meet in the valley to tell you this, leave it to our haole neighbor across the street to tell us...You gotta try Wo Fat because they serve the crispy gau gees with the noodles. Brakes screech. Say what?!?! Our neighbor once was stationed in Hawaii as a young gent and he was very fond of crispy gau gees back in Hawaii. Temptation 1.

Oddly enough, other neighbor's gf is from Hawaii and she says, you gotta go wo fat. Temptation 2.

So we go...and this review isn't going to be long. I was actually pretty disappointed. Damn you Manapua man for crushing every other persons attempt at fulfilling my crispy gau gee dreams! It wasn't what I imagined it to be. Although it can be nostalgic...but if you tell me like Hawaii...it better be like it especially if I gotta make the drive to the depths of that side of town. I'm not that much of a hardass, but their crispy gau gee just didn't seem to have much flavor...over cooked too. 

Although I get that Wo Fat is supposed to be like Hawaii kine Chinese food...it wasn't up to the rave that was presented to me. Maybe if the drive wasn't so out that way I could see myself trying it again...but since that isn't the case...I rather save my crispy gau gee crave for when I go home...home.

But don't let me sway you into not. I got a very particular taste bud that needs to be fulfilled if it is in sought of something. You may appreciate it. Just didn't cut it for me. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here on our way back to the airport.  We bought what should have been a variety of their best dishes.  Some were pretty good, some just ok, less tasty than I'm accustomed to fining in just about any Chinese restaurant at home in LA.

The place was not very big, or nice, that wouldn't matter to me if the food was good. The servers were efficient and very polite."}
{"text":"We lived in Las Vegas for around 15 years and Wo Fat was one of our favorite restaurants. It was sad when I looked through all the reviews to see it had hit a low spot for a while but, luckily, it is back. When we went to LV last time, we went back for our fav meal. 

We have tried many things but favorites are the curry puffs, fried rice, and the soups-hubs loves the pork noodle and my fav is the chicken noodle. It is everything that is good with a flavorful broth, thin tasty noodles and veggies,like bok choy, that always make me feel healthier.   In fact, when one of us felt like a cold was coming on, I would go get take out of the soups. 

We have travelled many places but have never found soup as good as we had at Wo Fat. I'm not sure what it is but it is the best that we've ever had. Now, that we don't live in Las Vegas, we have to hope we can get there whenever we are in town. 

I do recommend your giving it a try. I hope you love it like we do."}
{"text":"What happened? Yes, it's Chinese so poor service is keeping with the status quo. But the food has gone to crap. No more taste! My seafood cake noodle had sauce that I swear was microwaved - cold on the edges but piping hot in the center and GELATINOUS! Well what the heck is the point of driving all the way out here for gross food?! AND I ordered my food stating that we don't eat pork. They bring me fried rice with pork char siu. When I ask the server what it is (thinking MAYBE it's chicken char siu?) she said, \"It's pork. Just eat it.\" WTF?! You bet they got a tip that equaled their more crappy than usual service. After years of coming here, I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Wo Fat is the bomb! Had beef chow fun and baked salted pork chops, Great flavor, huge portions.First time there, read previous reviews on yelp, most all reviews are very good.I will definitely be going back for more of GREAT FOOD!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Haven't had Chinese food in a while but it's kind of my in-laws thing. We drove in from AZ to meet them and on our way to hotel stopped at this restaurant. The place was empty but your typical looking Chinese place. Sat down and ordered a bunch of food. Everything from pork with green beans to beef broccoli and ginger chicken. Of course they ordered way to much food but everything was great and flavorful. I'm so glad they wanted to eat here but it's someplace that they frequent while in town. Next time we're in town we'll stop by!! No pictures as the kids were hungry and I had to make plates and get sum bites in while I could."}
{"text":"My wifes favorite restaurant on a budget. Nice people/employees and great chinese food. We eat here no less than once a month and more if my wife and I share the same days off work."}
{"text":"Yes I'm from Hawaii like all the other reviewers. It's a total hole in the wall and far from my house but it really is the only option for Hawaii style Chinese food. I've always eaten in because it's so far, but unlike others I've always had good service. 

We were there specifically to try the pressed almond duck - finely shredded duck meat pressed together, coated with cornstarch and fried. Garnished w almonds and sweet sour sauce on the side. It was a lot of duck for $10. Not something I would have to order again but it was very good.

 Also tried deep fried garlic pork ribs, which weren't very good - meat was tough and garlic was burnt. Looked better than it tasted. And had to go with our usual crispy gau gee mein w cake noodle. Great as always -huge portion w lots of goodies and 4 big fatty crispy gau gee (like big big pork won ton)"}
{"text":"This place is just like the Hawaii chop suey places.  Crispy gau gee, cake noodles, kau yuk, roast duck, cold ginger chicken, spareribs...  Just like home.  One of my ex-bruddahz recommended this place and I gotta say I was impressed.  This is not Panda or any of those other \"Chinese\" places, this is the real McCoy or should I say Real Makoi Hawaii-style Pake food."}
{"text":"I went there the other day. While we were waiting for our food the cook came over and said health department is here. So we can't cook and they are closing down so you have to leave. I been going there for years. This is the second time I know of them being closed down. Guess I won't eat there again."}
{"text":"There's always something a little different about Hawaiian style Chinese food.  It's hard to described, but it's comforting and tasty.  Wo Fat conjures up memories of the old school Chinese restaurants (many of which are gone now) back in the islands.

The must haves include, crispy kau gee, stuffed duck, and cake noodle with anything.  If you have a bigger party or if you want to take home some food, the ong choy with harm ha and pork and the kau yuk are classic."}
{"text":"Hands down best Chinese food in Las Vegas! I love the quick Chinese food joints, but this one tops it all. I've been coming to this place since I was 5! It was always the place to go after church, when family visited and when you crave certain foods and don't know what it's called, you come here cause you know it will be here lol. 

 I live about a half hour away from here and I will drive here for good and affordable Chinese food!! This place is like home to me!!

The crispy kau chee mein is my all time favorite, alongside with the spicy pork chops! I recommend this place, it's a cute hole in the wall restaurant that has been here for years!"}
{"text":"After a failed hunt for manapua, a friend suggested that maybe I check out Wo Fat since it was basically on my way home. It took me a little while to find it because I didn't exactly know where I was going. 
When I went in, there were several large groups seated but I knew I was going to get my order to-go, so I stepped right up to the counter. I ordered the minute chicken with cake noodle because I hadn't had any good cake noodle since leaving Hawaii in January because I couldn't find any. The manapua would have to wait till another day. 
The ordering process was easy. Then came the long wait. And I mean LONG. You would think something with a name like minute chicken wouldn't take very long. But it was almost half an hour before I got my order. There wasn't a place for you to wait for a take-out order, so I basically stood on the side near the restrooms pretty much staring at the blown up articles they had on the walls. 
Once I got home, I realized that I needed to put the sauce on the noodles, which I thought was a good thing. (Even if I do like the sauce making the noodles soft and mushy.) I let it sit for a little while and went to do something else. When I went back to my food, I saw that it really wasn't a very big portion for the $10 I paid. It barely covered the bottom of a styrofoam container. It was a little disappointing. But the food wasn't bad. It was tasty and the cake noodle was similar to ones I've had previously. 
I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon, though. It wasn't worth the price I paid and I think I could have gotten more for my money somewhere else. But at least I got cake noodle. That was the one bright spot."}
{"text":"Wo Fat Chinese Restaurant  (Chinese Hawaiian)
702.451.6656
3700 E. Desert Inn Road    

Quite possibly our favorite Chinese restaurant here in Las Vegas.  For months, we searched for a good down-to-earth Mom & Pop Chinese restaurant that was no-nonsense and un-pretentious.  We figured we would have to search away from the strip and boy, were we right.  This is about as AWAY from the strip as you can get.    Located on the far east side of Desert Inn, Almost at Boulder Highway, we willingly drive all the way from Durango to here to get our Chinese Comfort Food-Fix.

Everything that we have tried on the menu is excellent, but the true gems are the House Specialty dishes that are up on the wall by the entryway.  I highly suggest the Baked Pork Chops in spicy salt, the Hong Kong Style Chow Mein and the secret dish Kau-Yu (Spelling?)  Which are tender BBQ Pork belly with Rice flour buns to wrap them in.

Dishes average from the $6 -$9 range with some special dishes above that, so it's very  very affordable.

Personal Note.
This little gem is HIGHLY recommended not just for the great food, but for the very friendly staff as well.   It's gotten to the point where we walk in and the Baked Pork Chops are already being cooked and it's just a matter of what new things we want to try on the menu."}
{"text":"Finally Hawaiian Chinese food! 
What exactly is Hawaiian Chinese food you ask? It's Cantonese food from Hawaii. It's nothing crazy just the Chinese food we grew up with in the islands. Wo Fat boasts many local favorites like crispy gau gee, cold ginger chicken, kau yuk, manapua and most importantly cake noodles!  Sadly I'd explode if I ordered all the fore mentioned goodness on this trip so I just stuck to the gau gee, oyster chicken cake noodles and roast duck. (Hey don't judge I gotta watch my figure!) 

Anyhow,
The crispy gau gee was on point! It tasted fresh (cooked in clean oil!) and had lots of meat stuffing. They didn't skimp on filling these bad boys! Thank god I was beginning to lose hope that gau gee was a lost item item doomed to never orderdom because of the consistent let downs. This place restored my faith that gau gee is still worth ordering.
 The oyster chicken cake noodles were just how I remember they were prepared at Mui Kwai in Hawaii; crunchy fried noodles covered in oyster chicken, bok choy and gravy. So simple but so good.This dish didn't stand a chance against me. I killed it before a single noodle had a chance to go soggy. Winnahs in my book!
The roast duck was a little different than what I am used to but it was ono (delicious) nevertheless. The duck came out plated wet with sauce. I am used to getting it straight from the hanging hook in the window, chopped and straight to the plate and not all sauced up. I'm not complaining about it but it just was not what I was expecting. 

There is nothing fancy about the food here, it's just good Chinese \"soul food\" just like how we remember Chinese food to be in Hawaii. This notion alone plucks at the strings of stomach and my heart and will have me coming back anytime I'm jonsing for Hawaiian Chinese food."}
