{"text":"I will not ever enter this Showmars again! I called in an order for 2 Greek salads with chicken. I wanted one with a shell and one without. I asked and repeated several times, please include my pita bread. I mean, I mentioned it at least 3 times. When I arrive at the location to pick up my food, I paid the cashier. She repeated my order, 2 salads, one with shell, one without. I said please make sure my pita bread is in there. She said, \"that is standard.\" I said, ok as long as it's there. I then sat down on the bench to wait for my food..and waited...and waited. I saw several people come in after me that had called in an order, paid, got their food and left. I still sat. Finally, the manager came to me and asked what I ordered. I told her. She went in the back and guess what? My salads had been sitting there the whole time! She gave me my food and apologized. I then asked for extra dressings. I got them and left. I decided to check my food before I pulled off. Guess what? My pita bread was not in there!! Seriously??!!! I went back in the restaurant. The manager came to me and I told her what happened. She got the bread. I was irritated at this point. Oh did I mention that the employees behind the counter were talking really loud and there were several curse words coming out of their mouths! Totally unprofessional.  So when I got home, I opened my bag and they didn't even have the Greek dressing in there. It was oil and vinegar! I never asked for that. Plus it was awful. I love Showmars Greek dressings. I'm done with this Showmars I won't ever come to this one again!"}
{"text":"Delicious fish sandwiches not so over the top onion rings, but for a location in yet another mall, the atmosphere of this food court, naturally lit, wood slats and not overly bright gonna give you a migraine type of lighting.  The Fish sandwich tasted very fresh, crispy and the perfect amount of food.  I don't do onion rings much but I have had better, but hands down, I would definitely eat here again and shop at the North Lake Mall, in Charlotte.  Its way calmer."}
{"text":"me and my family go here so much that the manager recognizes us whenever we  walk through the door. this is my go to place for a nice dinner for a great price.one my fav dishes  is the flounder..excellent!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is not. Sometimes I wait forever. Then I see other people who come in after me getting their food. And I always order a small salad.  Not going back anymore."}
{"text":"lara's review!  many years ago, when my husband and i failed to make valentine's day reservations, we ended up at showmars after trying to eat at several nearby restaurants with 90+ minute waits.  for the past eight years, going to showmars on valentine's day has been our tradition . . . and we love it.  i have to admit, we don't go to showmars much during other times of the year (mostly because we don't go out to eat all that often with two small children), but every time we do go to showmars, we think . . . we should come here more often.  the food is extremely well-priced and very tasty, and the service is fast.  tonight, i got a grilled chicken pita with extra tzatziki sauce, a side of fried squash, a glass of pinot grigio, and a hot fudge sundae.  my husband got the 4 veggie plate and a glass of wine.  we also got 2 kids meals and drinks, and another hot fudge sundae for them to share.  the total price tag:  $40 . . . and still a mere $48, with tip.  not too shabby for 4 meals, 2 glasses of wine, and 2 desserts.  my grilled chicken pita included two large pieces of chargrilled chicken breasts (spicy, but not too spicy), lettuce, hold the tomato, and a lot of tzatziki sauce.  the pita bread was buttery and crispy on the edges, but soft in the center . . . and it was perfectly proportioned to the chicken.  i'm not a fan of either the meat or the bread being too big for the other.  the fried squash was divine; crispy, hot, and a little salty (but rarely do i meet a piece of fried squash that i don't like).  the hot fudge sundae was simple, but really good -- two scoops of vanilla ice cream, thick hot fudge, a large serving of whipped cream, sprinkles, and a cherry on top.  the wine was good, but not great; although, i'm sort of a wine snob, and at $3.95 a glass, i really can't complain.  it was good enough.  if you haven't ventured to showmars, you really should.  it's cheap eats, but it's also fresh and well-prepared.  showmars has specials every night, so there are a lot of different options.  i've never had a bad meal there, and, if you want to join me sometime, you know where i'll be on feburary 14, 2012."}
{"text":"Just wanted to take a minute to Give Chris and the rest of the crew that is working tonight 9/30/16. Chris was courteous, professional and attentive. As a server he showed genuine care not just for me and my family but upon observation, we. Prices that he went out of his way to make all the diners feel just as welcome and he displayed leadership qualities that you don't see much for people especially of his age. He is a keeper, ;) management team."}
{"text":"I was greeted as soon as i came in. My order came fast and tasted ok, even though who knows how real Greek food tastes, they know its not how showmars tastes."}
{"text":"I also go to this location because of Kim. However, I have become disenchanted with this location as indicated by another user... Portion sizes are awfully inconsistent. I am spending typically over $40 and getting less than half that in value all the while walking away hungry. I hope they can get it worked out soon. You get more at other locations."}
{"text":"I've been in Charlotte for 10mo. and I've recently decided to try this place-  I've been here twice now for lunch!  both times had the chicken pita,  which is very tasty- my favorite! My bf always gets the Gyro, which also taste great! Definitely will be back again, the prices are pretty reasonable, and its a quick meal you can order to go."}
{"text":"Great reasonably priced lunch or dinner. Fast, friendly service and me and my husband both love Greek food!"}
{"text":"Showmars is my family's go-to restaurant for a healthy, casual, good tasting meal served by a friendly staff.  They never let us down!  I've been going to Showmars in Dilworth and Elizabeth for years, and really appreciate the upgrades to the d√©cor.  The restaurants look a lot nicer than they used to, with pretty finishes and landscaping, and they are always clean, which somehow makes the food taste even better to me.  I love the variety of healthier menu options, like the big, fresh salads and chicken Santorini platter with grilled peppers and onions.  My daughter really loves that, at the Dilworth location, you get free balloon animals on Sunday at lunchtime. A nice touch!  For a long time it's been one of my casual faves and I recommend it."}
{"text":"Service is always exceptional!  I only ever order the gyro or gyro salad because they are so good.  When ordering the salad you can get a pita instead of the taco shell and make gyro and have a salad also.  Excellent flavor!  No charge for extra sauce.  Great inexpensive place to eat."}
{"text":"Gray fresh food. A good place to eat maybe after church. Staff was nice and continued to check on us"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this Showmar's after we got married at City Hall.  Seriously.  I was on lunch break from work, and had to get in a quick meal.  No time for Blue or something fancier.  I had 20 minutes, and Showmar's would have to do.   (Rest assured, our wedding was the following week in Boston, but because of marriage laws, we had to get our lisence in NC. But that's another story.)   Anyhoo.  We got the gyro and the grilled chicken pita, one with veggies, the other with fries, both with unsweetened iced teas.  They were both solid! The service was great-- and one of the cooks overheard us talking about getting married just minutes before, and she gave us a free slice of coconut cake!  Is it gourmet? No, but it's fast, inexpensive, and tasty. Plus, there are coupons in home-mailers/coupon books ALL the time.   Nom!"}
{"text":"Friday, October 13th My wife stopped in for 2 Greek salads. The cashier somehow managed to swipe our Debit Card 4 times for the amount of $20.10  I received a fraudulent activity alert from BOA and by then my wife was home. I immediately contacted the bank and managed to clear up the mess. While I was on the phone with the bank, my wife contacted the East Blvd store and was assured a manager would call her back with an explanation.   Shorty afterwards my wife received an anonymous text with a copy of a receipt showing a $20.10 purchase. She responded to this unknown person asking who they were and why did they not identify themselves?  My wife also included a snapshot of our bank statement showing the 4 transactions. Immediately my wife had an incoming call. This was the person who felt the need to send the text with the receipt. She reluctantly identified herself as the manager and her name was Rachael and she refused to give a last name. Without a doubt, she was the epitome of rude and disrespect!! She informed us that \"our kind was not welcome in that restaurant and the problem was our account was denied because our account didn't have sufficient funds\". She made it clear we did not fit the clientele they preferred. You fill in the blanks on what she was insinuating.  We contacted Showmars Corporate office expressing our disbelief of our treatment by Rachael the no last name manager of the East Blvd location. To this point, we've been loyal and regular customers for years and we've eaten at most of their locations enjoying courtesy and great service. We are having a problem understanding how Rachael with no last name felt she could speak to us with such anger and disrespect. Her personal skills were lacking and she went out of her way to be unprofessional. Hopefully we will have an opportunity to speak directly with someone in Corporate so we can understand what was the message Rachael with no last name was trying to impose on us. I will update this review if I hear from Corporate."}
{"text":"Avocado chicken club salad was awesome. The pita bread was sooooo good. French frys fantastic ... overall it was great!"}
{"text":"This Showmars has REALLY gone downhill since the renovation. I miss the serving staff they had for years - all new people - and I loved those great people and it was a big reason for going there. After the renovations, the prices went up and the quality of the food and the experience went way down. It used to be so down-home good, solid and very reasonable pricing. Why even go there anymore when there is better food at similar pricing elsewhere? I have specific suggestions for them: sitting by front windows there are now two ducts unpleasantly aimed downward and blowing tons of freezing cold air right onto you. They have taken the napkin dispensers off the tables! The use of disposable cups and plastic ware - sucks. They have eliminated some of my very favorite dishes of theirs and daily specials such as their wonderful Spaghetti with 2 sides and toasted pita triangles (oh no! why?), delicious Hamburger Steak with grilled onions and gravy (damnit!) Baked Apples (so good! and sadly, the Tenderlion Tips are no longer a daily special). I do love their fresh fried squash - is it still fresh? Do they still have the amazing green beans? Their cole slaw has now become BLAND and tasteless  - it could use some dill weed or celery seed or...something! The fries are often overcooked. The new \"trendy\" (yeah, for the 80's) black bean salad is good but also boring/bland and could use a little oil and vinegar and maybe some cumin or something to kick it up a bit. I think the soups are from a plastic bag - \"fresh\"? It seems like less of the food is fresh or homemade. They used to play really good music, too - funk, soul, etc. Now it's annoying, crappy pop music. Worst of all is the service now - the last 5 times, I ran out of my drink before anyone noticed or maybe didn't ever even check on us again at all after the food was delivered. It used to be SO solid and reliably good. Hey I am just trying to help."}
{"text":"Great staff and as always great food.  Very surprised that they now serve beer and wine (it's been about 14 months since last visit).  Love the renovations and they have $1.00 off all beer and wine!  They are fancy now with a hostess too!   They \"lost\" my togo order. Was thinking about waiting a while again before returning. But they made things right without asking! Added an extra salad and shrimp entree!!! Thanks Showmars, Love you even more!  Wonder if they did that because I had my phone out, yelp app open and taking pics?...I don't care thanks for doing the right think and doing so without me asking!!!"}
{"text":"This location is very close to my office in Uptown so I came by for breakfast quiet frequently. So frequently, that most of the staff started to learn my name. They were also so kind and friendly.  However.. the food.. very hit or miss. Sometimes it is very dry with no flavor. The worst, however, was when I found a dead smushed fly in my gyro sandwich. I contacted corporate and they were of no help. It kind of turned me away from this location. Since then, I have only been back once or twice to find out that they have increased their prices for almost all items.  Today when I went, they had installed apple pay (it wasn't working at the time)."}
{"text":"I like that this location cooks a variety of comfort food as well as items on the regular menu. I hate that they got rid of their homemade lemonade. Something must have been wrong with the water because they offered a bottle of water instead from the soda fountain."}
{"text":"Low sanitation score and the entire restaurant seemed to be sticky and greasy.  Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Of the two south Charlotte locations (the other in Southpark mall) go to this one at least your food will be hot and fresh but I must warn you of the grease level here as with ALL showmars I have ever been to this one is no exemption"}
{"text":"I lived in Charlotte for three years before trying Showmars b/c I was under the impression that it was ghetto but I was so wrong. They have great specials each day and you really can't beat their chicken salad pita or gyro (better than some that I had at Speed Street this past yr). Service is quick and you get your food almost right away, which is a huge plus in my book. Great value!"}
{"text":"I had the Gyro salad in a shell. The salad itself was great. Wasn't a fan of the shell. I would come back for the salad and to try the fish. My friends swear by the place which i dont get but I am willing to try again. My friend had the chicken pita with onion rings. She wasnt a fan of either. The onion rings are pretty bland (or maybe Ive just had much better onion rings)."}
{"text":"I ordered spaghetti after friends raving about it. It was not good. At all. The server was patient with my party of 6. There are so many other places to go. When I'm back in the area, I will definitely check out one of the other eateries."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of this chain, but I do like the one on Freedom Drive for very specific reasons.  1. Their fish and shrimp are delicious, and their tartar sauce is awesome (they use their own recipe instead of the one the other stores do).  2. Their greek pasta salad is usually great (one time the pasta was seriously overcooked, but that was very much the exception to the rule).  3. Their baked chicken special on Thursday is ridiculous: a quarter of a chicken with rice and a fantastic gravy, bread, and two sides for a very reasonable price. You simply cannot beat it.  4. Main and most important reason: the people that work there are friendly and welcoming in the very best way. They've noticed everything from recent haircuts to times I've been in after a few weeks away.  This restaurant isn't located in a good part of Charlotte, but the people that work there represent the very best of Charlotte and really of North Carolina as a whole. They are so beautiful and warm and loving. Why on earth would you not want to go to a place like that, LOL?"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this Showmars.  This is the second time we have not been happy with the taste of our food. We got take out tonight. My chicken santorini was over cooked and had no cucumber sauce. My husband had the tenderloin tips and they were overcooked and very salty. The portions were about 1/3 of the size you get at Freedom Drive. Too bad we finally got a Showmars close to Belmont and it doesn't have good food. We will stick with Freedom Drive location."}
{"text":"Visited Huntersville location this afternoon. Friendly staff and fresh ingredients. I had a the veggie pita and my husband had the gyro platter. My only complaint is that I was disappointed at the small amount of sauce In the pita. Otherwise it was good."}
{"text":"Showmars on 7th is my favorite place to eat. It is All American fried food with a lot of other healthy choices. You can always find something good to eat no matter what you choose. I grew up in Charlotte.  The owner George is a well respected business man in Charlotte. The food is consistent every time. I eat here at least 3 times a month. The franchise owners are given the opportunity to add to their menus so you will find breakfast at some, bean burgers at others or just the original menu. Both my children grew up to work their as their first job. They were treated very well."}
{"text":"We have been frequent visitors to Showmars for many years & have always enjoyed the food & service. However, we went to the 7th St location on Fri night ( as opposed to E. Blvd) & unfortunately dealt with the rudest mgr. Upon getting home with my order I realized it was wrong. Even though this was my dinner for the evening , I called & patiently explained the situation. She did all but called me a liar, refused to rectify the situation, spoke over me in a raised voice & then refused to give me her name when I asked for it. So, you are going to lose loyal customers over an $8 Salad?? Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Apparently you have to be a regular customer so the staff will work on your to go order first.  I was in line waiting to give my order when regular customer so in so walked in the door and the cashier says hi mr so in so, let me get your order and let you pay ahead of everyone else already here.  Order took way to long after to receive too.  Never again."}
{"text":"Bad experiences at places like Ryan's kept me from trying Showmars. But I finally gave in because I found out they serve gyros.  And I hadn't had a gyro since leaving Chicago many moons ago.    To my surprise Showmars' gyros are really good!  Not gourmet or authentic by any means.  Let's just say most Greek restaurants don't griddle their pitas in butter.  But it's cheap, fast, quality diner food. Definitely greasy and if you order too many sides or dessert they'll have to roll you out on a gurney.  But for what it is, I'm a fan.  The crowd is pretty hip too."}
{"text":"If you are traveling within 50 miles of here and want to sit and have a lunch, come here!!!  Great smiles and greeting upon entering, massive menu selections for many various tastes, can grab a beer with your food, sit, get it expediently and all walks of life dine here. I had a country fried steak burger special and it was very flavorful, portioned right, and prepped very well. My wife had a chicken salad pita that was massive and fresh. I wish we knew about this place before today"}
{"text":"After a redeye flight we stumbled in with sleepiness in our eyes and emptiness in our stomachs.  I've only been to NC once before so Showmars is a brand new experience for me. Observations from my sleep deprived brain:  1. Nice view of the Hilton and some trees. 2. Appears rather clean 3. My food is cute; seriously, I took photos 4. Actual silverware 5. Biscuit came apart nicely 6. eggs are great 7. This pescatarian ate bacon!  YES"}
{"text":"Food = not as good as other locations Service = slow and sloppy Management interest - no manager presence Clearly indicative of a chain with no standards Cleanliness = do not know how the health inspector allows to stay open I called corporate office and got NO reply A total rip off!"}
{"text":"Worst choice for lunch I've made in a long time, their Big Gourmet burger isn't.  Service was great, food left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Been coming here for about 12 years, for something different. The flounder and pitas are great."}
{"text":"Food, menu selection and service is excellent! Fish sandwich is my favorite. They definitely have consistency and quality for the price. They are a sure bet for a quick fix. Even though you ordered at the counter you still get table side delivery and some service, I love that"}
{"text":"I went here the other day, and had terrible service. The workers were too busy on their phones and talking to another to pay any attention. As I was the only one in line and waited almost 5 min for someone to come help. I got my food(veggie pita) and it was barely full and really dry. I went back today to give it a second chance, maybe they were just having an off day. Ordered a small Greek salad that was 5 bucks.. waited 20 min, while people who came in after me were getting their food first. Once I got it, it was the smallest salad I have ever seen, especially for the price. It took me complaining to get my food. And was not worth the price. It had one slice of onion and one cucumber slice on it. I will never come back to showmars. I tried to give it a second chance and had a bad experience both times"}
{"text":"My favorite location out of all the Showmar's I have ever been. I lived in Charlotte for about 6 months and I would come here once a week for a lunch date with a good friend. The service is great, the employees are competent and very friendly. The food comes out quicker than anticipated and the food is very good. I always would get the Gyro sandwich & the meat is very flavorful and the tzatziki sauce is on point. The only suggestion I would make is the seating, during peak hours it's hard to find some spots. Overall, one of my favorite spots in the DIlworth area."}
{"text":"So I walk into Shomars and observe that there are two registers with two opposite personalities. In one register, jolly man. Behind the other register, grumpy man. As fate would have it, my order was taken by grumpy man.   He was in a hurry, barking inquiries. It's fascinating because I think he might be one of the owners. \"No Hummus!\" he barked at my question. Got it! Moving right along. The no hummus retort made me think the gyros might be boring, so I went with the All-American Pita Burger.   The Pita Burger was a delightful choice, served in pita bread with three thin patties, yellow-American cheese, lettuce and tomato. It hit the spot and is pretty unique to me. First All-American Pita Burger I've had at least. I'm craving one just writing about it!  Anyway--check Mr. Grumpy's out!"}
{"text":"Showmar's, like many of the restaurants in Charlotte, is owned by a Greek family and features American meets Greek food at their chain of locations.  Showmars does american greek better than the most, and they are typically quite busy, especially during lunch time.  I recommend the chicken fiesta pita if you want to go Greek, or the all-american pita burger if you want something less traditional."}
{"text":"I always stop at one when coming through Charlotte to get the world best fish sandwich. I normally don't care for tartar sauce but the sandwich is not complete without it. The burgers are good as well but my favorite is the fish sandwich."}
{"text":"So far the best Showmars of them all!!!! So great to be able to choose items on the healthier side!! I always get the lg Greek salad with chicken!!! No shell add pita breadthe manager Sam is such a sweetheart but its rare to catch him because he's always so busy in the back making sure the food comes out quickly my daughter has severe food allergies and he assured me that the food was going to be safe because he personally took the time to cook her meal! If that's not amazing service I don't know what is Thanks Sam!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Showmars wasn't my first choice this morning but the restaurant I was looking forward to eating at was gone! So it was a choice between here and Subway. I ordered a Greek omelet with grits and toast. It wasn't very crowded but they did have a lot of foot traffic. When my meal arrived it didn't look any different from a meal that I would've received at iHop & like iHop it had no flavor whatsoever. Granted the omelet was salty due to the feta cheese. I really wasn't expecting much just something to fill my stomach which it did admirably. I really like Showmars lunch & dinner selections breakfast just doesn't seem to work with them."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The place was nice and the staffs were so friendly, fast and helpful. The hamburger and soup of the day were awesome"}
{"text":"I'm only rating two stars because I really was NOT impressed with this location. I've been at the 7th street location once or twice, but I decided to give this location a try.   I came around 4pm on a weekday before the rush hour. The restaurant had some people in it, but still plenty of lingering staff and tables that weren't bussed. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries and it took 15 minutes for my food which is an okay time, I wouldn't expect much more time. The tomato wasn't great on my burger and the burger was just lacking taste, overall I wasn't impressed. The fries are good, but it's kind of a let down when you know that they probably came frozen and weren't made in house."}
{"text":"Yesterday before class needed something better than the McDonalds that I walked pass, this was it! I had the breakfast bacon and egg croissant and it was great huge croissant and a little price. Could not ask for more, I have class in the building and will be back to try more things. Looking forward to trying some lunch, great specials very student friendly!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh, fast and predictable. Staff are friendly. Ordered a chicken tenders special and a Greek salad with chicken. They are open on Sunday from 11a-4p contrary to Yelp's currently listed hours."}
{"text":"One of the best locations. Glad they did a major upgrade. It's a good place for lunch and excellent on a Saturday with the family. Not sure about other locations but this one has a Bar!!!! Don't forget to grab some coleslaw"}
{"text":"This location is NASTY. They used sour rags to wipe down tables & counters so the restaurant smelled gross. The salad had brown lettuce that was limp and slimy, their portion sizes were much smaller than the other locations where I've ordered the same meal.  Their menu had less options than the other locations which meant less healthy options. Do NOT go to this location, there are plenty of better dining options in the area."}
{"text":"Worse fish sandwich ever.  Gyro ok----- just ok Fish wash cold.  Also they didn't adk if i wanted wheat or white.  They may leave is take it back."}
{"text":"I have always loved Shomars but I might be a little biased since I worked there in college :-)...I have eaten everything on the menu and they have multiple locations throughout the Charlotte area.  The food is delicious, the prices are reasonable and the staff is always friendly...the calabash shrimp and the grilled chicken chef salad is the bomb!!"}
{"text":"The service was great, Kim did an excellent job.  She kept all 10 of us happy!!  My food was good."}
{"text":"Ok, lets start with the obvious. This is not the \"nicest\" area of the city. But I happen to work pretty close, so it is convenient for lunch.   I must say though I was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness, and level of service I received here.  The girl who took my order was very sweet, and helpful. Food was typical Showmars fare, everything tasted good. This Showmars also has daily specials & dishes that I have never seen at any other!  I think I even got free hush puppies!! (ordered a side they rang up as $0 on my receipt)  So yea, its a Showmars, and I think we all know what to expect out of them by now, but this was definitely the best one I have ever been to."}
{"text":"This location has always been dead the few times I have gone. Staff is hit or miss with being pleasant vs borderline rude which is probably why. I have dined in once and it was within an hour of closing time which may be a factor for the less than pleasant demeanor. Still, as long as I am within their posted hours of business I expect to be treated a little more courteously. After being seated, the server walked up and nonchalantly asked \"alright what can I get you\", just like that. My response: \"may I have a menu\". Perhaps they should make a post that states carry-out only after a certain time if they are gonna be feeling some type of way about late patrons...  I understand that this is a casual/take-out time place, but no one wants to be served out of disposable containers when dining in :-/ it's not quite a fast food place despite it being a chain so, eh!   Don't get me wrong, I love the food at Showmars's! The service is super fast also.  However, the staff at location is kinda blah!"}
{"text":"I love Showmars!!  You always know what you are getting here - fast hot food, made to order!  We come here a lot for work breakfasts.  It is locating the the Charlotte Plaza building near the Starbucks.    Huge restaurant area in case you are eating in.  The staff at the counter is so fast to help you.  I had the ham and egg on a bagel the last time I was here and the bagel was nice and soft.  Everything was so delis.  It is a great bargain for your dollar too!   Love coming here!!"}
{"text":"Warning to anyone who is conscious of what they put in their body.  I went to Showmars and did my best to select a \"healthy\" option.   I thought, \"The grilled chicken pita and a small greek salad can't be that bad.\"  After eating, however, I felt completely parched and uncomfortable for the rest of the day.  I checked the nutrition facts on Showmars' own website when I got home that night and realized why.  My \"healthy\" chicken pita had 1918mg of sodium, and my greek salad had almost 2000!!  That is over TWICE the daily amount the CDC recommends for a whole day.  I feel betrayed.  Everyone knows a hamburger is not the healthiest option, but when you order a grilled chicken and a side salad you don't expect that level of unhealthiness.  While I applaud Showmars for having the nutrition on their site, I think there should be some kind of WARNING for anything that has over 1500mg of sodium, especially when the average customer would never suspect.  It's just irresponsible and shows a complete disregard for the health of their customers.  http://showmars.com/menu/Showmars-Nutritional-Information.pdf"}
{"text":"Went with a church group for lunch.  It was too noisy for conversation and the table configuration was also not conducive for talking with each other.  I love Showmars, but the Alaskan fish that I got was chewy.  The fries and hush puppies were okay.  Usually I get the cobb salad with the wheat pita bread.  I sure shoulda stuck with my regular!   And usually I go to the Providence Road location, which is also preferable over the EAST BLVD location.  I based this on the service that is always given on Providence Road and was absent on East Blvd. I also base it on  the overall atmosphere.   But, I was happy to be with my friends, so it was okay.  But, this was proof that if it's not broken, you just don't fix it!"}
{"text":"Always clean & the management seems to always remember my order:) I come here for lunch & never been disappointed. The Greek gyros are my favorite & today I tried the chicken Mac & cheese which is awesome!!! I feel you get a good portion for the price. Better than other Showmars in my personal opinion. The food just tastes better here."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. I should have Yelped it first!! It's hard to see what it's like from the outside, but it's a hybrid counter/table service. I like my glass of wine... but the \"chicken souvlaki\" was plain breast cut into strips. \"Tzaziki\" was like sour cream with dried chives. The onion rings weren't bad, for breaded. Indifferent service. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Showmars is a local icon that has really grown throughout the years.  One thing they've always been known for and people rave about is the fish sandwich.  Unfortunately I don't really like fried fish so I've never tried it.  The grilled chicken pita is my favorite here.  Always fresh and quickly delivered! You order at the front, grab a number and they bring your food out.  I've always had good service at all their locations so the one here is no different.    I've actually had the pleasure of meeting the Owner of Showmars through my other passion (cars) and his great personality is probably a good reason as to why the restaurants have been so successful.  If you are looking for a quick bite to eat, stop in here or any of their locations.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fast food that tastes good.  Staff if FAST and friendly and pricing is affordable, though much of the food will add to the waist line *grin*.  My favorite here is Gyros......though I hear the Pitas are good too.  Plenty of seating but this location is hidden away, so if you are not familiar with downtown you may have to look at bit to find it."}
{"text":"I live just up the street from this Showmars, in Wesley Village, so it's super convenient. But even if it weren't, I'd probably still be a regular. As stated by Bill M., the staff is very friendly, and the daily specials are delicious. I've never had anything be less than tasty and freshly prepared. And the cheapest fish sandwich is the best! For a $5 lunch, it cannot be beaten."}
{"text":"Food was great  but service was slow. I got the  Slovaki Gyro With fries and it was delicious! I would still go back for second chance !"}
{"text":"Pita burger I got was so bland, so were the fries. Next time I'll drive to the one off Little Rock rd."}
{"text":"I wanted to wait before writing my review after eating at this showmars location. I thought that the portion size was EXTREMELY small for a $12 and in comparison to other locations, but I wanted to be absolutely certain. After visiting another one today I can't believe the difference, I now feel ripped off even more and I've included pics to show why. The top is the calabash platter from the East Blvd location and the bottom is the Calabash platter from the N Tryon. In each photo I've removed everything from under the shrimp and in the bottom I've eaten maybe 7 from the platter. In the top I've eaten two. Needless to say I'll never visit this location again!"}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointed.  Normally get TO from Emerywood location.  My wife really enjoys their flounder.  Dine-in coupons were reason enough to try their East Blvd. location.   Early evening visit with less than a dozen patrons, seated at a booth.  Wait staff was prompt, short wait for our meal.    Sort of went downhill after that.  We were not asked about refills after he set our drinks on the table.  Flounder was different than what we've gotten in previous meals, taste was fine, just seemed really thin.  Hushpuppies were overfried (hard) & somewhat bland.  Side of coleslaw had about twice the mayo needed, so was less than appetizing.  If I had to guess crinkle cut fries were frozen.  BOGO was the only thing that made the visit palpable.  Probably won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"Good food served fresh and well prepared, are the good parts of our experience at Showmars today.  We arrived at 4:15 pm, and were immediately seated by a gracious hostess.  At 4:45 pm, we hadn't been approached by the waitstaff.  My wife went to the cash registers, where 3 employees stood talking.  After my wife returned to our table, waitperson \"Gabby\" ventured over, bearing a detached and indifferent attitude.  She apologized mechanically, and took our drink order, explaining that she didn't know that our table was hers.  I reminded her about hat she had approached a table two over from our.  I further told her that we could leave Shomar's and return at a better time, if we were being a bother.  I asked how her day had been, hoping for a less tense atmosphere.  Gabby's demeanor remained stiff and indifferent throughout.  We tipped Gabby well. I drive Uber and Lyft in Greater Charlotte and don't receive tips, so I tip for all services, good or bad.  After leaving the restaurant, I call the  manager. She was insincere and made excuses for the Showmar's staffs indifference.  She gave a million excuses for the poor performance of the waitstaff and said that she would speak to them.  Finally, we have visited Showmars locations all over Charlotte and know what to expect in the way of service.  We will not visit the East Boulevard Shomars until the reviews reach a high level of satisfaction from the customers."}
{"text":"Casual dining... Fast!!!  That's an insane slogan. I mean really.  It's sort of a diner ish place that makes some random greek food. The gyro I had was honestly much too salty and dry.  But i'll say, it was fast."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Am I missing something? I just don't see why people give this place 4 or 5 stars. I have eaten here only twice - admittedly the first was long ago so I decided to give it another shot in hopes that it was better than the first.  I went with a Gyro combo with french fries for about $8. This is pretty average cost for a lunch sandwich - I'm not sure how the lady was able to have wine and dessert and dinner for 4 at $40 ... but maybe mine was a pricier item? who knows...  Let me preface by saying I went after a fast since I had blood work done that morning. By the time I ordered I was very hungry and honestly most edible things would have tasted great - but sadly I still found the food quality was a little lacking here. Loved the pita bread but there was basically just a ton of meat and sauce with very little onion and tomato. I like my gyros with feta cheese, cucumbers and all the great toppings ..this just didn't cut it. The tzatziki was herbless and tasted almost like they add a thickener rather than using simple greek yogurt. The fries were crinkle cut cafeteria-style and while crispy they lacked any real flavor.   +1 star for good pita bread +1 star for astonishingly fast service   Unfortunately Showmars wont be my go-to Greek place"}
{"text":"Neat diner style restaurant. Kim at the register is a fixture. I am not sure I've ever been there when she is not there. Quite a few great choices. I like the grilled chicken chef without the shell but the lettuce is mostly iceberg and white. The pita bread on the side is tasty. The Super C burger is really good too."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great menu items and daily specials. Reminds me of the Greek restaurants back home in NY. Friendly staff and fresh veggies. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular Showmar's more times than I can count.  It's the most frequented stop on our office's \"lunch train\".  As far as Showmars go, this is a pretty good one.  Great, quick, service, clean, and (if you go at 11:30 like we do), usually not too crowded.  Greasy food, but pretty good.  The chicken fingers are adequate, but you can find better at other places.  Their pitas and gyros are pretty good, too, with tasty tzatzschkalie sauce (or however you spell it).  A solid choice, but I wouldn't take the lunch train there every day.  My boss seems to love it, though!"}
{"text":"The worst breakfast  you can ever get stay away from this place for breakfast the service is bad the food sucks three attempts three times it suck the service and food."}
{"text":"I came here after a doctor's visit that required me to fast for 12 hrs. So you know I was HUNGRY and had my mouth set on a delicious meal from the trusty Showmars. I place my order and the cashier repeats it back to me correctly. This is the norm for my many past experiences. I receive my order and don't think to double check and make sure it's correct, as I've never had to do this in the past. I get home, lay my son down for his nap, and prepare to enjoy my delicious lunch...or so I thought. My order was completely wrong. It wasn't a pita burger and it definitely wasn't old fashioned. I called the cashier back and told her that I would drive back across town to get the correct order but after finding out that they close at 3p, that won't be an option. I'll just cut my losses but would recommend all guests double check to go orders to ensure that it's correct. Otherwise, you'll be set up for disappointment in this Showmars location as I've been. I wish I could talk about how perfectly cooked my burger was, but the dry, struggly, school-lunchesque burger that I was given wasn't even worth a second look, smh."}
{"text":"Hello Friends,   We came in for my son's last meal. Out of 5 people the tab only came out to 22.00 bucks which isn't bad IMO.   Showmars is Showmars.. Some offer a slightly different menu from others with a few add on's.   This location offers Fish for breakfast. And that's pretty much what we all ordered.  Fish and grits.   Nothing Special, Nothing wrong.   I go to this location often when I'm at my other job so I'll go back."}
{"text":"I come here often... for breakfast.  this location has croissants. THIRD STREET LOCATION DOES NOT!!! I usually call my order in while on the LYNX Train and its ready when I come in.   Showmars is Showmars... This isn't anything different from the rest.   Good food, ok prices.   Go enjoy..  Cheer's"}
{"text":"Food was tasty and reasonably priced.  Portions were large.  This is a place-your-order-at-the-counter-then-go-to-a-table kind of place, and the table service was good; they kept our drinks topped off.  Menu choices are mostly Greek / Mediterranean. Looks like they have locations all over the Charlotte metro area."}
{"text":"Super C was good. Usually go to Showmars for pitas but I tried the special today. Super C comes with fries or greens. I had the salad and a bottle of OJ to go with the juicy, double patty burger with onions and fresh, very fresh lettuce.   The staff were extremely nice. The lady who brought my lunch had a smile and even took my tray away when I was done. Made my lunch experience better."}
{"text":"Shomars has some unique takes on Mediterranean food here. When I walked in a patron said, \"The pita burgers are the bomb!\" I ordered the original after trying to decide between two different varieties. The meal comes with fries and a drink and I think I paid about $12 for my meal and my BF's. He ordered a fish sandwich which he also enjoyed. The customer service is great here. I almost forgot my change and the cashier reminded me just as I was walking away. They walk over to your table to take your drink order and they're not shy about bringing more. The cups are huge though so I'm not sure if you'd want any more than one cup of a soda, lemonade or sweet tea. Overall, I'd definitely go here again - it's really unique and tasty too."}
{"text":"My wife & mines favorite Showmars. We like the evening full service and that we can get a glass of wine or beer with our meal. The food is always good and the service pleasant and efficient.  The staff is friendly and the dining room and restrooms always clean. Very family friendly place."}
{"text":"So the wife was craving fish and it was a Friday so her logical choice was Showmars Fish Friday. Apparently, half of Monroe had the same idea. This place was packed. Line out the door. I'm not even kidding. So we waited about 10 minutes in line, then ordered, found a table and proceeded to listen to my wife brag about the fish. When it arrived, I had a full plate. Lots of fried fish, hush puppies, coleslaw & extra tartar sauce. Almost every thing's better with tartar sauce, right? The fish was nothing to write home about. Good flavor but not enough crunch for me but again I resorted to drowning my fish in tartar sauce. It went down just fine. I love the hush puppies but can you really go wrong with hush puppies? The wife wouldn't back down from her claim of the best fish around kind of like Sean May won't back down from a buffet line. We've been married for some time now and she'll always be right and Sean May is somewhere in Europe still in a buffet line."}
{"text":"I got a flounder dinner there recently, asked for some extra tartar sauce. They wanted to charge me 50 cents for it. The expense won't kill me but that is the kind of thing that drives me insane. It's just a big FU to the customer to nickel and dime a person like that. So I will return that sentiment to this restaurant and just go somewhere else. Congrats Showmars you saved yourself 8 cents worth of mayo and relish and totally ticked off a potential customer who eats out a lot. Food there is OK, nothing special."}
{"text":"The quality of service as well as the people serving has greatly diminished since the restaurant relocated here.  Greatly missing the servers and set up of the older showmars located here in Gastonia.  Will not return here."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Showmars a few times now for both breakfast & lunch.  Service is always fast & efficient.  The food is always hot & tasty.  I've had the pita burger and gyro for lunch, both were very good.  They serve crinkle cut fries which are crispy on the outside, fluffy in the middle.  They are not quite a fast food place, but not really a sit down diner either.  Along with burgers & other sandwiches they also offer dinner plates with tenderloin tips to fried fish.  Nothing fancy here just good food with prices that are comparable to other fast food places."}
{"text":"Was in the area and stopped in for our favorite, the roasted Grecian chicken. Just as always, tender and juicy with those wonderful Greek spices. They also had fried squash that was spot on- lightly breaded and fried just right. They were not greasy nor turned to mush the way some places do fried squash. Our granddaughter was with us and got the chicken tenders which must have been good 'cause she made a happy plate! Service was much better tonight than we have had in a long time here. We had an older Greek lady that was friendly, keep our tea glasses filled and even brought our granddaughter a large chocolate chip cookie for dessert. All though service was much better tonight, I still can't go up to 4 stars as this may have a been a one time thing, we'll have to wait and see cause we will be back again for that roasted Grecian chicken!."}
{"text":"I love Showmars. Never had anything here I didnt like. I typically go with the calabash shrimp dinner or shrimp and fish dinner or fish sandwich. All great. I usually call ahead and pick it up. You can dine-in but I'd rather not. Food is cooked fresh but doesn't take long."}
{"text":"Great chicken! I have enjoyed the chicken pita, Greek Salad with chicken, Chicken & Rice Soup and I love all. The chicken is seasoned to perfection and the portions are large. A definite lunch spot in my book."}
{"text":"The food quality is low but the prices are more then fair. This is a greasy unhealthy diner and that works for me when I want that. The raving reviews crack me up because not one food item here is special.  The place doesn't try to make anything special it pushes out super fast cheap greasy spoon food.  So if you want some eggs and a biscuit for dirt cheap in the am this spot is great.  Just don't even come near here if you want to eat organic healthy food.  I know I will come in for some cheap calories now and then."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Showmars. Mostly because they have the BEST calabash shrimp. I normally skate by ordering the shrimp off the kids menu. This location is the only one that put 2 hush puppies with the kids meal (this \"puppy\" very much appreciate that).  In the evening this place confuses me a little... instead of going up and order the food, the \"hostess\" (whoever isn't doing whatever else) will sit you and someone will take your oder. It's more \"full service\" I suppose, but cmon, I didn't come to Showmars for a dining experience. I much rather just to order my food at the counter and just bring it to me. Sometimes it takes forever to get a seat and another forever to order. If I want to wait forever x2 I will just go to a real sit-down restaurant.  BUT regardless, I will always be a fan of their shrimp. I promise you it's good."}
{"text":"Visiting for the weekend and was told that Showmar's is a local chain and worth checking out. Here are the pros and cons:  Pros: 1. The restaurant was extremely clean. 2. The staff was very helpful and kind. 3. They bus your table for you. 4. The food was ready very quickly.  Cons: 1. The food itself isn't anything to write home about. 2. The Greek aspect of the restaurant isn't a very authentic representation.  I ordered the chicken pita, what I would consider to be a staple at the restaurant, and just wasn't very impressed with it. There wasn't anything necessarily bad about it, but it was kind of mediocre meal. The fries weren't anything special either.   If you need a quick meal, Showmar's is a good option for their speed and kind staff, but if you're hoping to experience a unique chain local only to Charlotte, then you might be better satisfied with a different choice."}
{"text":"This is a chain but this definitely filled my gyro fix. I ordered the gyro platter with onion rings and Greek salad. Soft pita, hot and fresh. Friendly service and fresh fast meal for under 10 bucks I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the hummus at this Showmars! I have put so many of my coworkers on it! You get a side for only $1.72, and it's not a tiny size. The people are super nice and fast, as well!"}
{"text":"As a new Charlottean, I only discovered Showmars a few months ago, and I've already run out of fingers for the number of times I've been.  Showmars has the five things going for it that I like to see in a restaurant... Clean environment, friendly service, fast service, tasty food, and good prices.  Being a creature of habit, I have a long way to go to make it through the menu, but have thoroughly enjoyed what I have tried.  This location, if I have the right one, also has a really nice view from the mezz/2nd floor in Uptown.  For casual dining, it gets a two thumbs-up in my book. Updated: After going more times to different Showmars, I'm going to a 4 (3-1/2). They do a variety of items; some they get spot on, others, not so much.  Still a good place to dine."}
{"text":"So the Showmars in the Charlotte Plaza building (aka Charlotte School of Law building) is back open for business after a remodel.  It's super bright and modern looking with a different set up... the ordering counter is up front and you can get your food to go or dine-in.  If you dine-in, you get a number and your food is brought out to you promptly.  There's a round kiosk station in the center of the floor that has the drink machine, condiments, utensils.... etc.  The dining area is pushed to the back, next to the windows.  You can eat and look over the plaza fountain and also see the clock fountain across the street at Wells One.  There's a mix of booths and tables, so you can combine tables if you have a large group or so.  Servers are super nice and they even clean up after you when you finish dining.    Definitely a good option for breakfast and lunch if you work uptown - needing something quick and casual."}
