{"text":"Worst Italian we have ever had. Called to get takeout and was greeted by a nasty host. Called back to add to the order, and was treated equally nastily. Was told that the order would take 20 min, and when showing up after 30 min, I was told that the food was still unready. 

The food was under-cooked. The meatball sandwich was mostly breadcrumbs. We will never return to this restaurant for food. Horrible service, and sub-par food. Given the prices they have, it is a joke."}
{"text":"Ordered veal parmigiana and the veal cutlet was like a piece of leather. Everyone from the bar was using the outdoor seating area as a place to smoke cigarettes. The waitress even took a long time to refill the water. I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Great place to grab an excellent meal at a very reasonable price! Friendly staff and a great environment!"}
{"text":"They have a amazing pasta with tasty scallops and shrimp, clams, ect. The lasagna is also really good. The prices are a little high, but not bad for the food you get!"}
{"text":"This was my first restaurant that my husband took me to when we first started dating and we've been going back ever since (going on 9 years).  Love their food especially their pizza's and the tall beers (great price for them).  The parmesan crusted salmon is tasty too!!  Definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this only a three star review, we go there often and it is always a wonderful experience. That is of course until we decide to take friends from out of town with us as we did this night.
When our dinners came out several wait staff brought it. All but one of our dinners came. After a few minutes my guest got up to inquire about the missing meal and a waitress he found assured him it would be handled. After 10 minutes our original waiter came over and ask how everything was. We told him the person without food in front of them was not enjoying watching the rest  of us eat. 
By the time the missing meal arrived we were almost done eating and was boxed up a few minutes later. 
Apologies were given but no offer to at least not charge us for the uneaten meal. My guests were treating to the meal, and were gracious about the event. I would not have been so forgiving if it were me. 
Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Been in the service industry myself as a server for two years, with that being said our server's presentation (Cody) was flawless. His professional demeanor and attentiveness was so refreshing and something you don't get very often these days. Very good meal from the beginning with our Caesar Salads to the end with Peanut Butter pie my girlfriend and I split, which is too good to pass up! Thank you server, and hosts for your smiling faces and friendliness."}
{"text":"I've been to this Benvenuto's about once a year since it opened. Each visit the experience gets more disappointing. Let me say I really want this restaurant to succeed. This location is perfect for the Northside community. This visit was with a group of 7 women. The host was friendly but in a rushed robotic way, he made no eye contact, just recited the expected welcome and thank you phrase. There are a lot of elderly folks that eat here, having someone opening doors for them would be good. We were seated at a nice table with plenty of room for all of us. I like the cloth tablecloth, I hate the sheet of paper over it. My sleeves were constantly getting caught on it. In past visits I enjoyed the server coming to the table and making a production of pouring olive oil on a plate with herbs and then grinding fresh black pepper into it. The server would deliver fresh warm bread in a cloth covered basket. That did not happen this visit. There were two plates with dried herbs and a small bottle of olive oil on the table. No explanation that bread would be coming, as a matter of fact it didn't come until we had our drinks. There are huge hard cover menus. It would have been important for the server to take a few minutes to talk about the dinner menu and the appetizer, wine menu. I love seafood and looked forward to the Shrimp Scampi Capellini which was described as having jumbo scallops, shrimp and crab. The bowl of capellini arrived with 3 nickel size scallops, 5 shrimp and pieces of brown seafood that may have been crab. The shrimp still had the tails which meant I had to eat it using my fingers (I hate doing that with a pasta dish!) This was a $12-15 meal not the $23.50 charged. I had a salad (included with dinner). It was fresh and had a good mix of expected salad ingredients. The woman next to me ordered Portabella Penne-her first comment was \"this is weird, it has too much basalmic sauce\" It was way over sauced to the point of not being able to identify other ingredients. She commented that to the server who didn't offer any solution even after it was clear my friend wasn't eating her meal. Several of us asked for extra parmesan. The server came out with a big hunk of cheese and a grater. That was a fun touch until each of us had a pile of grated cheese on our laps-even though all of us held our hands out over our bowls to try and keep the cheese going the right direction. The server brought me a glass of water as requested but never refilled empty water glasses for the rest of the group and it was all they were drinking. I feel like the restaurant has let the special touches become a boring routine and needs to really address quality control. The prices on the menu are way too high. Even the nightly \"specials\" were priced too high. I would pay those prices for a memorable meal. Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Benvenuto's catered an event that I attended, and initially I was excited when I heard that the food being served was Italian, but once I tried it, I was severely disappointed. This was probably the worst Italian food I've ever eaten. There was simply no flavor whatsoever, even though there was sauce piled everywhere. The food was also cold, and the salad was absolutely bland."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Excellent! Upscale Italian restaurant vibe with music, fountain, and some of the friendliest servers you'll experience. Molly was our most recent server. She was spot on. Our daughter loved being able to color on the paper table cover. However the paper does detract from the upscale vibe a bit.

Food: Bread and oil to start the meal is amazing! We ordered traditional spaghetti and meatballs, and chicken parm. The food was just alright. Not spectacular. Left us wondering if we should have ordered something else instead. Warning flag if the free bread is the best part of the meal...

Prices: Menu prices are on the higher side for sure. Almost not worth it. If the atmosphere and service weren't so great, we probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"All the people here are super nice. I really enjoy to have meal here. The price is  also really reasonable. Every dollar you spent here worth more then it.
I would like to go there with my friends next time."}
{"text":"Very classy, great food, friendly service. Attentive and great prices..."}
{"text":"Traveling on business and staying at the hotel. I had the special, which was a filet with an over easy egg in top . I loved it!!! Service was prompt. I'd come back again to explore the menu. Everything looks really good!"}
{"text":"Locally owned and operated, casual dining restaurant that is great for a business lunch or a family dinner. Awesome fresh, fast power lunches!"}
{"text":"After having to ask 5 times for new silver ware because they were incredibly filthy, I finally get some noodles with meat balls. The noodles were clearly boxed. The meat was very cheap pork filler. Over priced for what you actually paid for. Could of made this at home for a few dollars. 
We did get a free piece of pie for the silverware hassle though."}
{"text":"Was at the Middleton location half price apps good thing because if I would have paid full priced I would have had a FIT!!!!! 1/2 priced wine YEAH!!!! that was the only thing. Left with gut rot!!!!!"}
{"text":"So I had both a good and a bad experience. Mixture of the two.
We came in on a day that wasn't busy, so our service was great. Our servers name was noelle. Very sweet girl, and great at her job. She knew the menu well and wasn't overbearing.  
I ordered a sirloin (medium) I think about $18 and my boyfriend ordered ribeye $22 (medium rare).
The bread before the meal was okay, but didn't really outshine any were else I have been.  
We both got a ceasar salad as well. Just the right amount of dressing, good start to the meal.
My sirloin was more on the very well done scale. I ate only half because Everytime I took a bite it tasted like charred bits of meat.  (The side of potatoes was great though).
I ate about half of my boyfriends meal, as his was cooked to perfection! Melt in your mouth perfect. Spectacular flavor. I wish my meal had tasted like that. 
The only downside to his was the amount of fat left on the plate after it was gone. 
Overall I had a great experience here. Friendly staff, great atmosphere, but the food quality varied."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant.  Excellent service',!!!!very good food,,nice environment , I'd  recommend  it"}
{"text":"We used to really love going here.  Past few visits have been spotty. Like they didn't have ingredients for the dishes that we picked out.  So we picked out a different dish and it seemed rushed."}
{"text":"Placed an order for pickup.  When I showed up at the hostess desk, the hostess didn't seem to know anything about it and even started looking in a wastebasket at crumpled up pieces of paper.  She asked me if I knew the name of the person who took the order.  I told her the name.  She then went back to the kitchen and eventually came out with my order.  I was just about to leave but thought that since they didn't seem to know exactly what was going on, I should check the bag.  I found the side salad I'd ordered wasn't in the bag and the hostess excused herself again.  She came back with a salad but it wasn't the side salad we ordered.  She could have made one in the time it took me to wait.  I took it anyway because I was now running late to pick up my wife from the airport.  As I walked out, I heard someone call the hostess by the same name as the person who took my order.
When I got home, I found they also messed up another part of the order.  I asked for a three-meat calzone with added mushrooms and black olives.  When I got home, I discovered there was zero meat in the calzone and very little of mushrooms and black olives.  Needless to say, this ruined our dinner experience.
Have been happy with the food here but this is the second time they have messed up a take-out order.  The first time they gave me veal parmigiana when I ordered eggplant parmigiana.  This ruined my wife's dinner because she is a vegetarian.  Am reluctant to patronize this location anymore because can't trust that we will get what we asked for."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant in Fitchburg. Good selection of entrees ranging from traditional Italian to pizza. Nice bar area with a nice mix of wines and beers. Very kid-friendly with a good menu of options including spaghetti and pizza."}
{"text":"One star is way too high and is a gift.  The prices are too high, the food stinks, and everything is a'la carte.  The hostess, RAE, gave me a $10 gift card.  That's the only reason I'd go back.  The place has really gone down since I used to have lunch there.  And I'd only order what was covered by the gift card.  Very bad taste in my mouth from this dump."}
{"text":"This is the epitome of a chain restaurant and the food reflects that. 

Ordered the onion rings ($7.99), chicken fingers ($9.99), pasta trio  ($18.99), and 12 oz ribeye ($20.59).

The onion rings could have stand to stay in the fryer longer,  we couldn't get a bite in without the batter slipping of the soggy and  mushy onions. 

The chicken fingers could have followed the same technique. They offered sauces of ranch,  honey mustard, or buffalo and we went with the buffalo sauce. I didn't realize they would be serving up Frank's RedHot in its watery form... I guess it works? 

The bread  basket,  minestrone and tomato bisque soup that came with our entrees was the highlight of the meal. The bisque was absolutely delicious,  a creamy comfort to a cold winter night. The minestrone had hearty chucks of ingredients in a savory broth. 

The pasta trio arrived with unremarkable Alfredo fettuccine, a flat piece of chicken parmesan with little sauce,  and a small ramekin of dry lasagna. At least at Olive Garden,  they try to dress it up a bit by offering cracked black pepper and grated parmesan cheese with your overpriced noodles. 

The worst was the ribeye. By the time my partner got done cutting through the edible pieces,  he had
 about 8 oz of fat and gristle left on his plate.  He chose fries as a size and it was as much of a disappointment as the meal; a child's portion of dry,  stake cut fries.  I guess ours or fault for not ordering what they are known for... oh wait that's nothing. 

I will say the servers are incredibly nice and try really hard."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I think it is pretty good, it isn't amazing or anything. It is almost like an expensive Olive Garden but a little more classy. They have a cool way of waitering though the waiters and waitresses write their names upside down (upright) to the customers and its great. Anyways, not really the greatest place in town but definitely a nice getaway."}
{"text":"Yum. Great service and very attentive staff.  I eat there so often the staff know me and the others that dine with me that they know what our names and they welcome us back like family. They will ask me if I'm have the beverage that I usually have and will bring refills without my having to ask for one. By the way they make great Bloody Marys."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times, most recently at a dinner at the beginning of a bachelorette party. I think this is a very decent option for someplace on the north east side. 

For the party, they were very accommodating for a larger group and us adding our own decorations to the tables. The gals hosting the party had planned it with the restaurant and had a fixed menu with three options available for everyone. It worked out really nicely for our party and the food was pretty tasty. I don't remember exactly what I got but I do remember enjoying the boxed up leftovers when I was hungover the next morning. 

The service was very good considering we were a boisterous group of about 20 ladies. I was having an ice tea craving that day and think I went through about 8 glasses of the stuff while we were there. The two waitresses helping our table we spot on. They even allowed us to bring in our own cake and provided plates for serving it. 

Overall, I think it's decent basic Italian food, but really good at handling larger parties if you call ahead."}
{"text":"Benvenuto's is exactly what I would expect for a Wisconsin Italian food chain. While perhaps not authentic, it's reliable, reasonably priced, and has always had excellent service. The wife is a big fan of their tomato basil bisque (which really is very good), and I usually rotate through the chicken or eggplant parmigiana, chicken tetrazzini, or some variation of the manicotti. I'm told the pizza is also quite good, though I've never tried it myself. Oh, and their artichoke dip is worth trying as well."}
{"text":"My meal -- mushroom risotto -- was unfortunately ruined by quite a bit of grit in the sauce, which indicates a lack of care and cleanliness in kitchen. Otherwise, it's a nice, soccer-mom kind of place. 

Pro tip: Clean your food better before cooking."}
{"text":"The best thing I can say about this place is some of the decor is nice. I say some because for the price I shouldn't have to eat on a paper table cloth. The drink menu was terribly out dated but their food menu looked delicious. I ordered the shrimp capallini and my bff ordered the seafood primavera. The food was out within 10 minutes of ordering which made us immediately think the food wasn't fresh. The shrimp in both of our dishes were slightly rubbery and tasteless.  The crab in my bff's dinner was intolerably fishy and her veggies were not even close to being cooked! The waitress was rude and seemed bothered by any requests! Don't waste your money on this place!"}
{"text":"disappointing.

server was nice and pretty attentive but that's about all good i can say about this place.

we ordered an appetizer of mozzarella sticks that were pretty decent but nothing to rave over.  while we were still eating them, our tomato basil soup arrived so i had to juggle which one i wanted to eat before they got cold.  it turns out, i didn't much care for the soup so that was an easy choice.

mid-way through the appetizer/soup course, viola!  our main course arrived.  i admit, it's a pet peeve of mine to get food before i'm ready for it.. so that's a big part of why this restaurant is not my favorite.

however, the dishes we got weren't particularly good either.
i got the spinach chicken ravioli with marinara on three and alfredo on the other three.  the chicken didn't seem quality and it was stuck in the raviolis in chunks and it distracted from the consistency of it as a dish.

my beau's steak was inedible.  his first bite was gristle -- so much so that he had to spit it back out.  he only managed to gnaw through half the steak .. and i think he did that only because he was so hungry.  he asked for it medium-rare and it came so rare that, if it was me, i would have definitely sent it back to be cooked more.

overally, i was just disappointed by benvenuto's.  
bummer."}
{"text":"Gave it four stars last time.  Food and service has gone down hill since then.  The specials are absolutely atrocious and old standbys we used to like are lower quality.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"An apt subtitle is: a franchisey-spot (with a standard menu) that makes a big deal of being locally owned and operated and would do better to spend more effort working on their food or tailoring the menu.

I can't disagree with others regarding the \"classy crayon\" server name on the table paper business. Two colors!  Wow! How Pizzeria Uno! :-/  SMH. Twice.  Ok, three times.

I guess after over 20 years of eating nommy Italian food in Chicago, Boston, and, well, Italy, I really don't understand why one would want to confuse expectations by calling what this place serves \"Italian.\"  It has, unfortunately, more in common with takeaway pizza joints and steakhouses than anything else.  

Calzone is really more of a stuffed pizza.  It's just...wrong.  Very, very wrong.
Pasta was...not good...and that included tries at four different dishes.
Sandwiches were...fine.  Nothing special, but fine.
Steaks are / were the only dishes that the (fairly large) groups I've eaten here with have enjoyed - mostly with additional gorgonzola, demi glace, or mushrooms.
All of the sides were fairly meh.

One deeply held personal gripe: it really bugs me when beer menus don't indicate what's bottled and what's on draft; it bothers me even more when (based on how offerings are grouped on the menu), I think that I'm ordering a local beer on draft, only to get it bottled (with no warning).  This, for me, makes it impossible for me to bump my rating up to an \"A-Ok\" - it's misleading and intentionally crappy.  If only one local beer is available on tap at a time, that's fine; just make it clear to guests before they order."}
{"text":"Dined here as staying in the hotel. Had a promo card so the kids ate free. Cajun pasta was more tomato than I was expecting but packed with the proteins (chicken and sausage). Wife had the Classico which was excellent as well. Servers were friendly even though they were very busy"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Went with group of 10, seated by ourselves in a room.  Still way too noisy.  Could hardly hear person next to you.  Food served to 8 of us - waited till got cold, started in.  Rest finally served - said kitchen mixup- should have let us know upfront.  I got spaghetti with italian sausage.  Pasta too soft (not al dente) and Paul Neuman or Prego sauce better. Sausage was best part.  Folks next to me got seafood pasta - said only found shrimp in it, and too cheesy.  Mine needed cheese - was halfway done before waiter appeared to ask for some parmesan.  Better italian places out there - at least at chain Olive Garden you get soup and salad too!"}
{"text":"I've always had a good time at this restaurant. The staff are very friendly, and the drinks are great. The food ranges from okay to good, but the atmosphere and staff always make it worth the visit."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant when I just need to get out of the house on a weeknight.  Food is solid and their beer and cocktail prices are maybe the cheapest in town.  A martini that would be $12 or $13 at the Hilton is $7.  Trevor, Dale and the folks who sub when they aren't bar tending rock!!!"}
{"text":"Open Table has decent reviews. So we tried it out of convenience. Big mistake. OG would have been better. 

I can currently hear the staff talking about closing early since it's empty inside. We're the only table. You can hear the boh as well. 

The bruschetta was pretty abysmal. It's like they deep fried the bread.  There was no mozzarella.  They had 'spread' instead. The prosciutto was low quality. It's the only explanation I have for how minced it was. 

The lemonade was extremely tarte. 

I had the prime rib melt.  I ate half a sandwich because I had a migraine coming from hunger. But the meat was dry.  & the ju was suuuuper salty.  They asked if I wanted to take it. That was a hard no.  

It was a huge disappointment.  The waitstaff kept walking after we were done, just walking by. Te only table in. It made us uncomfortable. 

Anyway. Never coming back & definitely telling our friends of this subpar experience."}
{"text":"Some colleagues and I dine here a quite a bit as there aren't a lot of options on the North side, and it is conveniently located near where I work.  I love their Southwest Chicken Salad, it's something that I will order for pick up several times per month.  I have found that they are getting more and more stingy on the ingredients. They aren't putting much chicken on the salad, maybe 4 tortilla strips (they used to put MANY more) - it's a $9 salad, I expect it to be a little more hearty. I feel this place is pretty overpriced for what you get, and the food has never blown me away."}
{"text":"Worse service I have had in my life. Waiter Alex failed to put in food order after waiting at table for 30 minutes . Failed to bring water to the table after asking twice.When I asked another server he rolled his eyes ."}
{"text":"The Beaver Dam Benvenuto's - the original location - is wonderful. This one is a bit so-so (much like the Northside location). My food was alright: lobster ravioli. Nothing amazing, but tasty enough. The rest of my party (4 others) all had nice meals, but none of us were amazed. Desserts were lackluster. Service was very good, but the tables are overly large and it's really dark. I had trouble reading the menu.  A decent meal out with the family."}
{"text":"Surprisingly nice decor and ambiance for the price.  Good drinks.  This place is less expensive than I would expect although the service is pretty amateur.
The wine list is very limited.  I don't know if they have a corkage, but it's probably not too high, so if you have your heart set on something, bring it in.  They have a selection of options so if you're looking for wine, there are some chiantis, zins and pinots on the menu to choose from.
I had the meat lasagna.  It came in an individual dish with a nice melt of cheese on the top.  The problem was, the bottom was all noodles, then the meat and sauce, then the cheese.  It wasn't really layered.  My kids ordered off the children's menu - one got the spaghetti with a meatball added, the other had fettuccine alfredo.  Both were reported to be good.  DH had baked spaghetti with a sausage link.  The sausage link didn't show up until he flagged the waitress down, asked for it and then waited a bit.
I would go back, but not if I wanted a fancy dinner."}
{"text":"Last time I was here I asked for my ribeye steak medium- well. it was overly well done and dry (fail). Last night, I asked for my ribeye steak medium-well. Again, it was overly well done and dry (fail again).

Tonight I call them for room service from the adjoining hotel. This time I order the \"Ranch Hand Ribeye\" (per the menu - smothered with chipotle sauce, mozzarella cheese and onion straws). I ask for it done medium this time. So, up comes the order missing the soup and the bread that I ordered and zero toppings on the steak. I call down and they send up the soup and bread but spin me a tale about the steak and the computer and  how it should have cost me $3.00 more because I didn't get the toppings that I ordered (what!?). Steak actually was medium-well cooked this time, so I let it go but all in all I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"I like this location better than the Fitchburg.  Its quieter and very close my office.  The service is always really fast and on point.  Today, I had an eggplant parmesan, which I finished and really enjoyed.  The portion wasnt overly large and it was prepared well.  Last week, I stopped in and had on two seperate occasions a steak sandwich and a veg lasgana.  Both fell a little flat for me.  The lasgana, though tasty, was really swimming in white sauce.  The steak sandwich was simply underwhelming.  Having said that, I would consider eating both again."}
{"text":"Food is neither amazing nor stellar, but the service is consistently good.  Having said that, I cook a LOT of italian food and my standards may be unreasonably high."}
{"text":"We tried Benvenuto's after a movie Saturday night. It was a good experience.

The host greeted us at the door and told us there'd be a 20-25 minute wait. We hung out at the bar while we waited. Our bartender was friendly and efficient. I thought the beer pours were generous and fairly priced.

When our buzzer rang we made our way back to the host stand and our waitress led us to our table. She was friendly and fun. She recommended the calamari which was served with banana peppers as well as marinara. It was lightly breaded and perfectly cooked. The bread served with the oil was soft, fresh, and aromatic. For dinner we had the seafood cannelloni and steak Gorgonzola fettuccine. The steak was perfectly cooked and both the fettuccine and cannelloni had excellent flavors and textures. It was a very tasty and filling meal."}
{"text":"I really liked my meal here.  We stopped for lunch and had sandwiches and salads.  The bread they bring is good, as was the rest of the food.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food at Benvenuto's is wonderful...I especially like the minestrone soup.  Service is generally fast and friendly as well.  The only frustrating part is sometimes they say they will deliver to my house, but then other times I call for a delivery and they won't deliver to my area.  Very odd and frustrating.  The times we have gotten delivery things were incorrect or missing so I suppose either way it is better to just go in and eat."}
{"text":"I love this place! So happy to have something like it on this side of town - nicer establishment with a great menu selection. The staff is friendly and attentive, great bartenders (one of the best happy hours in town), and the food has always exceeded expectations. Love the Bruschetta Chicken pasta dish, Eggplant Hoagie, and the Garlic Shrimp pizza. My dad, a notoriously tough customer, said the Tenderloin melted in his mouth and that the Lemon Berry Torte is his new favorite dessert (part of the \"seasonal\" offering - amaaaaazing).  They are also excellent at accommodating large parties; I've been to a few at this location and will definitely host a function there in the future. Great place to take a date or for a night out with the family."}
{"text":"If you have to order a buffalo chicken wrap at an \"Italian Grill,\" there's something amiss. We ate here because everything nearby was closed, and it was a total waste of time and money. All the pastas are clearly from the same three pots, and the menu was too long for anything to be really great. The restaurant is huge but there was only one other party there. The server was rude and deliberately slow - even turned away pointedly when we waved him over to ask for more napkins. The portions were ok but the food was bland and overpriced."}
{"text":"I placed an order to pick up. While it was ready as promised, when I made it to my hotel room - there were no napkins or plastic wear  I ordered chicken Alfredo and a Caesar salad. The salad was great, unfortunately, the chicken Alfredo wasn't. The chicken Alfredo tasted extra bland and of course - they hadn't included packets of salt or pepper. The pasta wasn't mixed well with the sauce and ultimately, I just added the chicken to my small side salad. The dressing added flavor to the chicken. Totally disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. I've eaten at all other locations (Madison, Beaver Dam and Fitchburg) and this location falls short. Ordered the calzone...much of the lower crust was burnt. Husband had the cajun pasta...the andouille sausage and chicken both tasted re-heated. Won't go back. Service was a bit slow...the place didn't seem that busy but server was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great service.  Bartenders are friendly and the place feels like Cheers to me.  Great family restaurant too.  We have three kids and they all have their favorites on the menu.  When we talk about going to a restaurant, they always vote for Bene's, even though I (sometimes) wish they would pick somewhere else for variety.  I can't, and wouldn't, say a single negative thing about this place."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent  service is great and staff are friendly. They have great salads and potions are large. The atmosphere is great and the place is clean."}
{"text":"So just placed an order for delivery. Mite I say lady on the phone sounded like a she dint give no F but what I was asking.. Order spaghetti with meat ball ex meat ball and garlic bread. Came up to 29$ and some change!!!! Spaghetti and meat ball norm cost 12$ am I missing something here? If the food turns out good my rating will change."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 6 every one liked their food.

I had soup and  clam chowder was a lit different than classic but good. French onion was good as well.

All dishes Overpriced though..."}
{"text":"I ordered through Ubereats. My order came fast and hot. When I opened the bag, the chili was not in there. The person that prepared my order \" Alejandra\" just put in the soup of the day. Beer cheese was the soup of the day and I absolutely HATE beer cheese. I also ordered 1/2 chicken 1/2 shrimp and I received all shrimp. I called the store and Alejandra explained that they are out of chili so she just decided to give me whatever. She also states that I could only have one or the other for the tetrazzini. I informed her that  order often and I always get half and half as long as I order the most expensive option. Not happy at all. I've been in the service industry for 12 years and this is not how you do business. I usually don't write bad reviews because I get it. Alejandra just let a horrible taste and didn't try to fix anything."}
{"text":"I eat dinner and breakfast here.  Dinner service was great.  I thought I was in a different restaurant for breakfast.  Took awhile for someone to seat me, waited awhile for a refill on coffee.  They seemed a little under staffed for the crowd which was not that large, less then half the place is full."}
{"text":"Amazing truffle bernaise sauce on the tenderloins.   James and Tony are amazing bartenders and recognized me after 3 months.  You would be stupid to pass up such a great experience.  Lots of regular bar patrons that know the bartenders as well.  The food is good and the chef knows how to cook a perfect medium rare tenderloin.  This place doesn't get the credit it deserves.  If I lived in madison this would be a place I would regularly visit.  I always sit at the bar so I can't talk about the rest of the place.  If you are unsure then go sit at the bar and be chatty :).  - Brian"}
{"text":"Close to home, this place is a staple in our dinner rotation. We love dining in as well as having food delivered, particularly on a snowy night in. A typical Italian restaurant, Benvenuto's has delicious pasta dishes in addition to pizzas. I waffle back and forth between chicken tetrazzini and the margherita pizza. You really can't go wrong with any dish. The restaurant boasts a beautiful indoor water feature, and it really adds to the already beautiful decor. We've been frequenting Benvenuto's for years, and we will continue to do so for years to come!"}
{"text":"We live right down the street, and had never visited until recently - but now we are regulars! The beer specials are great. The service is normally awesome. The soups are ridiculously good, we scout out when the soup is going to be Philly Cheesesteak and go then. My husband always gets the Pasta Trio and adds a meatball (GIANT!) and I normally get the Chicken Parm or a Calzone.  

The things I have noticed that are not my favorite are that some of the servers are real stinkers - but most of them are awesome! The Chicken Parm can be kind of dry (pasta wise) and the time spent there can be very varied. Sometimes we feel a bit sped through, and other times everything takes a very long time. You never really know!

Overall we love this place and plan on visiting frequently. We always fill out the survey that comes with the receipt a lot of times."}
{"text":"So I basically come here because of its close proximity to my parent's house, not because I love the food or ever crave anything from here.

The space is really huge, probably way bigger than necessary because I've never seen it that full, although there is a separate room with a large bar that is pretty nice.

The food is all extremely generic, in no way anything like \"authentic\" Italian. I would never call anything I've had on the menu \"original\", in fact I wouldn't be surprised if the entire menu's meals were frozen in boxes in the freezer.

If you are hungry and nearby with picky eaters, go here, there are a lot of options, it is reasonably priced, pretty fast, and as mentioned earlier, generic, so it gets the job done, but without much enjoyment."}
{"text":"The restaurant is actually in the Holiday Inn I'm staying at during a business trip. I decided to try it (especially since the hotel gave me a coupon to use) 
I at there twice and both times it was empty (which I don't mind) the service was good and the food was good too

I had:
Smothered cod:
I liked the taste but it was a bit oily (from the pounds of cheddar they put over the cod and shrimp) the garlic mash was good too  

Shrimp Alfredo fettuccine:
This dish was humongous and tasted good(although I added salt  ...but I always add salt...I know I know )

Both meals had loads of shrimp. 
Soft drinks have free refills (nice)

If in the neighborhood  I'd say go for it  but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there"}
{"text":"Live on Northside, this is one of few restaurants. It's fine, I guess...on 100 Point scale, I'd give it a 55... Just read through my past reviews, and realized I only write about great and horrible experiences. When something is three stars, not worth the time. This is an average three star space. Aka basic Italian"}
{"text":"Food was decent and service was friendly. Timing was not idea. Salads came before the appetizer. Then the meals came less than 2 minutes after appetizer."}
{"text":"We have been dining here for quite a few years now.  It has consistently good food.   The pizza is fantastic.  They don't have an increased topping charge for \"gourmet\" toppings like basil.  I find that annoying at other restaurants.  They do not skimp on toppings either.   I ordered basil and got plenty of it.  Not just a few pieces strewn about.   

We have always enjoyed our meals here.  The salmon tasted fresh and the pasta is very good.  They have specials and change up the menu on occasion.  The service is always great.  Everyone there seems happy to serve you, not just doing their job.

We have had them cater a lunch for about 50 people at work and they did an excellent job.  They accommodated for a special diet restriction without reservation.  

It is not fair to compare this place to an Italian restaurant in Chicago or any other big city.  If you want Chicago Italian food, go to Chicago.   

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good place to eat with good service."}
{"text":"I would give a 3+. The service was great, the restaurant was clean and nice atmosphere. Presentation was beautiful but my dish, chicken tetrazzini lacked the flavor I was expecting. The Steak Gorgonzola I was told was excellent. All in all, good food for the price and a decent wine selection at a good price point."}
{"text":"Got bad food poisoning from the seafood cannelloni last night. I would not recommend that dish"}
{"text":"The food is always good.  The beers are cheap and the service is above average.  It is not the cheapest place to eat but it is worth the price.  Last time we ate there we spent less than forty bucks for two people with beers and tip"}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about Benvenuto's, and when we walked in, the place was gorgeous... Wonderful ambiance, great decor with lots to look around at. There was one small problem: the food.

I had one of the dinner specials, a pasta dish in the carbonara family with bacon and peas. For the calorie load I was taking on, I expected my pasta to be a mountain of creamy goodness, but instead it was just swimming in oil. My dining companion had the shrimp tetrazzini, which was predictably rather bland and creamy.

Here's what I look for in an Italian restaurant: fresh ingredients, unusual combinations, maybe even some homemade pasta. The menu at Benvenuto's made it look like this type of place, but for me it didn't deliver.

If you're someone who likes the Italian-American classics (fettuccine alfredo, veal parmigiana), then this place is probably fine for that, but honestly I think Olive Garden does it better. Sorry, Benvenuto's."}
{"text":"Pasta was good. Steak was nothing special. I can make better. Not my favorite place but I'll come back."}
{"text":"I went there around 6 pm in a week day. The service was a little bit slow. I got a pizza and it was really really good!"}
{"text":"Good, reliable Italian food. A surprisingly nice restaurant for this neighborhood. I often order the lemon-basil salmon, done medium, and I like it a lot. Risky to order fish at an Italian restaurant, but it's mostly very good. Pizza is terrific, too."}
{"text":"Our first impression of their service wasn't too stellar. We had no utensils and appetizers were placed on the table....and the servers didn't seem to notice until we asked! Oh well. 

The rest of the night was pleasant.

We ordered scalloped stuffed mushrooms (White mushroom caps stuffed with fresh scallops and garlic, then wrapped in bacon and topped with a baked parmesan crust). It was hands down our favorite part of the whole meal. Too bad they only give you three! Love that their focaccia bread was all warm and sliced into bitesize pieces.

TIP: Skip the olive oil that they hand you for the bread. Dip it in the garlic sauce the stuffed mushrooms came with. With a squeeze of lemon? HEAVEN!

We also ordered the pasta trio (fettucine alfredo, chicken parmigiana, and beef lasagna...and a meatball for $2) and the steak gorgonzola (Fettuccine with fresh spinach and a gorgonzola alfredo sauce, toped with grilled beef medallions and drizzled with a balsamic glaze). 
 
The pasta trio was humongous. Bf said it tasted decent, the meatball was too salty though. The steak gorgonzola was also a big portion. it was too creamy and rich for my liking, especially after stuffing my face with the appetizers, but it didn't taste too bad when I brought it to work the next day. 

Overall a good and belly-bulging night. Definitely wanna come back and try their french dip sandwich. Apparently they use the previous weekend's prime rib and soak it in au jus for a week before serving it as their sandwich. *drools*"}
{"text":"We went there last night for our anniversary.  It was a great evening. Deb was our server and she was super. Enough attention to keep our needs met and yet, not hovering. Lots of personality and very attentive. My husband had his shrimp tetrazzini and I had a rib eye. Both meals were delicious. The atmosphere near the water falls is very soothing. It was an especially lovely evening."}
{"text":"We ordered a Prime rib dinner.  When asked how we wanted it prepared, we requested rare.  When our order arrived, it looked more like well done pot roast.  We immediately showed our waitress, who apologized, acknowledged that it should have been rare, and took it away.  The manager then brought the plate back and said that because of the way they prepare it (slow roasted over night), rare wasn't possible.  This was an odd explanation as we have ordered this at this same restaurant before with no issues.  The manager then took it back and got us a steak, but it came out burnt on the outside and completely raw in the middle.  Needless to say we left.  We did provide this feedback to the restaurant's website.  Someone did respond and apologized.  They sent us a $10 gift card for our trouble.  In general, I would say stay away.  Service and service recovery are not a priority for this restaurant."}
{"text":"When I stepped into this restaurant I was hungry, really hungry! Having not had any breakfast all I was hoping for was for the service to be as fast as possible, and I got just that. Even before I write about my food, I would like to mention our waiter Jake. He was super attentive and friendly. I had my drink refilled almost a second after I took my last sip. Being super hungry, I really appreciated that. 
Coming to the food, the menu is very limiting to vegetarians. What is bothering is that while most restaurants can adapt their recipes to accommodate vegetarians, no such an option exists here. We ordered the 10\" Margherita pizza (our only other option was the 4 cheese) and the Eggplant Parmigiana (which had only two other contenders, a cheese ravioli and a tortellini). The Margherita certainly was not authentic, but was still flavorful. The addition of minced garlic was a surprise. I assumed the garlic bits would dominate the basil and cheese, yet nothing of that sort happened, which was pleasantly surprising. The spaghetti accompanying the Parmigiana was perfectly cooked and the sauce was just about right to go with the eggplant. Both the dishes did not disappoint nor did they amaze us, they did more than just satisfy hunger though.
I do believe this place has promise and wish to see them deliver it."}
{"text":"Awful! Everything is loaded with cheese and grease. Wish I read the reviews. Even lettuce on the Caesars salad with light dressing was soft & soggy. Go elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken parmesan, noodles dry and not enough sauce, chicken burnt and lack of cheese is a joke. Ordered french onion soup and was given minestrone.  Onion rings tasted nasty and the only edible thing was the salmon.

Greeter on the phone needs to learn english as we had to repeat things multiple times, maybe she has adhd.

McDonald's down the road has better quality."}
{"text":"Expectations weren't high as I realized it was a chain but it is a definite step above Olive Garden or places like that.  I didn't feel like going out and this was the restaurant in the hotel so I figured I would give it a go.  Glad I did because they served me one of the best fried calamari dishes I have yet to have.  Excellent batter, tender Calamari, top notch really.  The Penne Supreme dish was good as well.  I would definitely try if I were in the area and would go back if I were in the same hotel and did not feel like going out.  I believe they do the room service for this Holiday Inn Suites but you might want to check first."}
{"text":"Oh such a disappointment.  I ordered the parmesean crusted salmon but they got my order wrong.  I ended up with grilled salmon which was very salty.  The salad was very crisp & fresh.  The next day I ordered the vegetable flatbread.  Oh it was horrible.  I only ordered from here as it was close to the location I was staying at.  I was just pretty disappointed.   The only thing I liked here were the cheese sticks."}
{"text":"I went to the Benvenuto's on the south sidee, you can see my review there, but this is nothing special.

My cousins and I ate here before a movie with their friend. They like it, and they have the bread that's pretty good, but the menu isn't really the same and I was disappointed that they had only three soup options.

For an appetizer, they give you a pretty decent tasting bread. It's soft and there is olive oil to go with it. They brought us two baskets for our table of 4. Not bad.

I wanted to order soup, but all they had was Tomato Basil and Minestrone. Neither of those sounded really appealing so I ordered Portabella Penne. She asked if I wanted a salad or soup to add, and I asked what my options were. It's a house salad or a Caesar salad, but there is an upcharge, which she didn't tell me. I thought perhaps it was like Olive Garden and it came with the meal, but no. It was extra. 

As I said in my other location, definitely order the dressing on the side. I practiced that again and boy was I happy I did or it would have been drowning.

Overall, it wasn't terrible, but it was nothing to write home about. I wouldn't go there again if I didn't have to."}
{"text":"I will give this place 3 stars for their bread as well as their lunch service, it was friendly and attentive.

My mother and I ate here, she said she liked it. She had a pasta dish, and I had the unlimited soup and salad, zuppa and Caesar salad.

The soup was good, but extremely meaty, with bacon. I don't prefer bacon so  I ate the broth. It was still tasty and if you like soup, but the Zuppa Toscana at Olive Garden is much better (sorry, sad truth).

If you get salad, ask for the dressing on the side, which is what I usually do, or it will be drowning. Also, definitely try the bread, it's warm and quite delicious.

Finally, we shared the salted caramel cheesecake. The cheesecake was probably a B. I'd eat it again.

I wouldn't eat here for dinner and I wouldn't choose to eat here again, it seems pricey for what I had, but I would eat lunch here again with my mom if she wanted to eat here."}
{"text":"Love this place. Awesome customer service and very affordable. Our server Cody went above and beyond. They all write their name for you before they serve you to give you a phenomenal experience with your sever. You also get bread with a delightful olive oil dipping sauce before your meal for free. I highly suggest you go here!"}
{"text":"Wow, so I was not expecting to like Benvenuto's as much as I did.  It has a reputation for being overpriced and stuffy.

I could not disagree more!  The atmosphere is friendly yet private.  The restaurant has cute alcoves with booths that allow to have a private dinner with your significant other.  At the same time, it is bright and clean inside.  

My husband and I went in there for a couple of drinks and appetizers.  Their Artichoke and Spinach dip is amazing.  Wow.  It is served with Focaccia bread.  It is just delicious.  Their regular prices are great but if you go during happy hour, appetizers are half off.  

The service was great and I can not wait to go again.

So why not a 5 star rating?

The parking lot is so cramped that it is difficult to maneuver.  The bar area is a bit tight.  I appreciate that they left room for a patio and a spacious dining room but I feel like the bar could be a tad bigger."}
{"text":"We've gone here twice for dinner and we have really liked it. Try the scallop stuffed mushrooms, they are awesome. Great lasagna, chicken parmesan, and terrific focaccia bread. If you're in the mood for something Olive Garden-y, but you're like me and you hate the O.G., try this place. A great place when you want to eat somewhere and not be annoyed by a TV (they have a bar for that).

Perhaps a tad expensive for what you get, which is why I downgrade from 5 to 4 stars. But 5 star food and service both times we've been there."}
{"text":"I stay in the hotel regularly. I have eaten at the restaurant several times out of convenience.   However the food is horrible! It is over priced for greasy badly seasoned food.  I have had the stuffed cod, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, truffle Mac & cheese. All have been a high disappointment. 

However they have great bar prices for drinks sooooo I recommend sticking with that! :)"}
{"text":"Considering all the rave reviews I'd heard about Benvenuto's, I was pleased when my ex-boyfriend wanted to take me out to dinner there.  Mmm, Italian, right?

Nahhh.  Not so much.  It was like a slightly souped up version of the Olive Garden.  The food wasn't bad, but it was truly unimpressive.  I got something that should've made my head explode with deliciousness (because, honestly, what's not to love about sausages, peppers and pasta with spicy tomato sauce?), but instead I was left feeling quite \"Meh\" about the whole thing.  Plus, the place was noisy and lacked any inkling of ambiance.

If you want a good Italian chain, go to Biaggi's.  If you want good Italian, PERIOD, go to Lombardino's."}
{"text":"Changing my review from 4 stars to 1.

We've been ordering here for 3 months now buying lunch for my wife's staff at $150-200 per order.  Not counting all the times we've been there for family events and date nights.

The most recent order was around $200.  We called it in at 11am, when they opened, and was told it would be ready at 11.30.  When the food was being loaded in my car I discovered one item from the order was missing.  We found that I was not charged for the missing item, but instead was charged for a pizza we did not order that was presumably in one of the bags.  I asked if it was too late to switch the pizza for the cajun pasta (the missing item).  The manager on duty said no, because it was already in my car.  I said, can you comp us another cajun pasta then?  He said, \"we're not in the business of giving out free food.\"  I said, it's not free, we paid for something we did not order.  He said, \"I was the one that took the call, I'm certain you ordered it.  And we went out of our way to have your order ready on time, since you didnt call us enough in advance.\"  I said, is there anything you can do, because we just ordered $200 worth of food and you're about to lose a customer?\"  He said no and I left.

I think this is probably the first time I've ever had a restaurant REFUSE to correct an inaccurate order."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. We had the Benvenudoes pizza, I highly recommend it. Today was a birthday party for my Mom, they did great job with fast and friendly service for our large party of 10."}
{"text":"Had to wait a little bit to be seated this past time I went. But nothing to horrible. Prices are a little high but the staff is always friendly and the food always tastes really good. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Food was great however the service wasn't good at all. I had to ask for the bread and dip, we had to ask for refills on our drinks. And Our bill was incorrect. Wasn't very impressed with our server."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night so it was extremely busy, which is to be expected.  

However management obviously didn't plan staffing well because the waitresses were in a frenzy trying to keep up.  Our particular waitress was clearly unnerved and looked miserable.  It wasn't hard to see that she didn't want to make small talk, she just wanted you to hurry up and order.  So we did.  It took a really long time for the food to come up.  We waited at least 45 minutes for our main entrees.  The food was just ok, and our waitress messed up my dining companion's order and when we asked about it she was like, \"oh sorry!\" as she dashed away and that was the end of that.  

So the food was average, not great.
The service was rushed and unfriendly.
Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Not super, but not bad either. After sitting In a really long class the last thing I wanted to do was climb in a car. Ick. Enter Benvenuto's.

I placed an order to go with a nice young man.

Ordered the ribeye steak. While it wasn't the best I've ever had, it hit the spot and satisfied my hunger and yearning for a steak done medium rare. It was cooked as I asked. Not the most flavorful, but it came with a little packet of A1 which came in handy.

I ordered the spicy chicken Cajun pasta for my husband which he said was pretty good. 

Nice option. Close and decent food."}
{"text":"Here for a business lunch. Good service. Eggplant parm very good. Minestrone soup was terrific. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"First I would like to start off by saying that I would have given a 4 star but they changed the sauce they use in the lasagna. I've never had a sauce with carrots and celery until now. Didn't like it one bit. 

Other then that this is one of the better places to eat on the north side. My wife and I love to hit up the bar for Monday night football. The bartenders here are really great. I don't need to ask anymore what I want to drink because they remember me (makes a person feel liked). Plus, I've never had a skunky spotted cow here. Don't know off they sell a ton of it or what. Beer and food prices are average. Pizza is better than average and topping taste fresh. 

I see people like to gripe about the name in crayon on the table. Who the hell cares! I stink at remembering people's names. I go here because it is casual."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here, or a bad customer service experience. I tend to bring my more finicky friends and family members here because it's pretty standard, run of the mill Italian without stooping as low as Olive Garden. The bread that comes before the meal is fantastic!!! There are usually decent specials and the price is fair. My bit of criticism is about something that may not matter at all to some people... but for me is such a big deal. The wine glasses are tiny, sad, and pathetic. This place prides themselves on having an extensive wine list (which they absolutely do). So then why not invest in proper glassware? Bold reds are not meant to be drank out of chintzy little wine glasses. You have to let it breathe! Rant over."}
{"text":"Well.. Went here for dinner and drinks on Saturday night around 6. Nice atmosphere not too loud. I ordered a vodka tonic to start the evening and our waitress brought that right up my girlfriend however ordered a French martini and that took a bit. Upon bringing her her drink she said sorry if it doesn't taste good that's the first time he's ever made one. Seriously? Bartender never made a French martini? It was ok but didn't taste like any French martini she's ever had. The food was good tasted fresh. The chicken parmesan and the fettuccine Alfredo were safe bets so we ordered that. Not too long of a wait and nice portions. Wouldn't mind going back but probably not a first choice :/"}
{"text":"Nothing like the Fitchburg location.  I brought a group there for a business lunch.  The place was completely dead, which made for a stunted, awkward lunch; a lively room makes a group of coworkers more willing to get social and have a little fun.  Despite the lack of customers our food took forever.  When it did finally come, they brought all but 2 of the meals, creating that awkward situation where we weren't sure if it was ok to start eating before the boss gets his food.  I took a chance on this place an it was a big fail.  My food tasted fine, which is why they got 2 stars.  I love Benvenuto's Fitchburg, but I'll never return to Benvenuto's West."}
{"text":"We are always satisfied here.  Good prices on beer.  Tasty food in big portions.  I don't think any dish I've had was particularly memorable - kinda typical mass-market Italian, but it never disappoints."}
{"text":"They said they were open 11 to 11. We made a long trip to go there. When we got there they were closed. Apparently when they say they're open 11 to 11 that is not true except for the bar. I was very upset to have driven so far with my family for a late dinner only to find out they have no food available in the evening."}
{"text":"Benvenutos is exactly what you'd expect of an Americanized \"Italian\" restaurant. They've got your fresh baked bread with olive oil, a wide variety of parmesan filled or topped pastas, a bunch of red wine that doesn't technically go with your meal, and some ridiculously cheesy music that really only should be played in a movie when someone is riding a gondola in Venice. Sometimes this is exactly what you want, a definite dad pleaser for my family. Sometimes you want something that actually comes from Italy, which probably couldn't be further from the menu here.

Tonight I had a six ounce sirloin with some seasoned veggies. The sirloin was medium rare as requested, but pretty charred on the outside. I suppose ill stick to pasta next time, it's what they do the most of. I also tried their chili which was good but had no kick at all. Perhaps they meant minestrone? The best part of the meal was the fresh bread. I mean that not as knock to the meal and more as a compliment to the bread. It was seasoned really well and had a nice hardness to the outside to give it an awesome texture. Great starter!

The service was about as good as you can get from a restaurant that had their waiters write on your table in classy crayon. The place looks nicer than a Chilis, but when they start the meal by demonstrating your tablecloth is actually a roll of paper it sets the tone for a pretty laid back meal."}
{"text":"I have only been in here a couple times.. Both times I have not been pleased by what was handed to me especially this last time I was there with my family.. Both my dad and I ordered the Alfredo and my mom and sister ordered steaks. All meals came with a salad that had Browning lettuce when handed to us. We mentioned this to the server who simply said, \"yeah, we have had a lot of complaints about the salad tonight\" so we returned the salad and wasn't offered a substitution. When we got the meals, the steaks were decent. A bit overdone but the Alfredo was so funny it wasn't sticking to the noodles. Also didn't have much flavor.. Was more plain and was more like colored water.. We said our complaint and the food was removed from us but not the bill even though we ate nothing. So we were disappointed and unsure if we will go back seeing how both times have not been very satisfying. Sorry."}
{"text":"Our family took my mom here for her birthday- what a huge mistake.

Our reservation was for 7:00 and we were sat immediately, but no one came to our table to even give us water for 15 minutes. It might had been longer if we didnt go back up to the hostess and inform her that no one had helped us or even so much as checked on us. 

From there, we had to ask twice for the complimentary bread (which was salty beyond reason), the waitress had no knowledge whatsoever of the wine or beer selections, and I had to ask twice for a beer I ordered because the waitress forgot to put the order in the first time.

The food didn't make up for how completely awful the service was. It wasn't bad but it was nothing to write home about- in my opinion the menu is a little overpriced.

We were comped tiramisu in place of a small birthday sundae and that was quite delicious."}
{"text":"Benvenuto's is a charming little restaurant attached to the Holiday Inn. The service was friendly and cheerful. In deciding what to have for supper, the server was able to describe the entrees as well as the garnish. This is important, as my wife has many sensitivities. They start you off with a little focaccia bread and you prepare your own dipping plate. My wife ordered the scallops with risotto. The scallops came out with a fantastic sear, hard to get in some of the best restaurants, but no problem here. The Caramelized Onion Risotto was fantastic. I ordered the Rib eye and it was perfect. The best part was yet to come
. I was not expecting such an outstanding meal with great service for such a great price. We will definitely remember Benvenuto's"}
{"text":"Easily one of my favorite restaurants for many reasons! It is a little on the pricier side but well worth it. There truly isn't a single item on the menu that you can go wrong ordering and you will always leave with delicious leftovers due to their generous proportions. Wonderful atmosphere, I never feel rushed through my meal like at some other restaurants and also never find myself waiting an unreasonably long time. Recently I had a dark haired girl named Molly who's service was impeccable, easily some of the best I have ever had anywhere! Will be sure to request her as my server from now on."}
{"text":"I'm almost embarrassed to write this review because I really enjoy this place and the other reviewers do not seem to feel the same way.  Regardless however the man and I go to Benvenuto's quite often for lunch and dinner and we both love it. 

The entrees are served with bread with olive oil and Parmesan cheese flakes that we love!  They also come with a soup or salad option as well.  We always sit at the bar and though the bartenders are never particularly rude they also are not overly friendly.  Despite that though I enjoy coming to this place and have many favorite dishes. 

The man orders the baked spaghetti and meat balls; that's actually the only thing he orders because he loves it so much.  I'm not sure what my favorite dish is there but I've ordered pasta with a red creamy sauce with chicken and sausage that I love.  I have also ordered their pizza and have loved that also.  

All in all, I love this place and always look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I jumped on Yelp to look up the hours for Benvenuto's and was very surprised by the many bad reviews.

My wife and I regularly eat at Benvenuto's in Fitchburg because I find the food to be good, prices reasonable, and service perfectly fine.  Benvenuto's doesn't try to be something it's not.  I don't believe their goal is to be fine Italian dining, but rather a restaurant that has a variety of Italian meals, with a mix of American options for those looking for something different.

I've tried a variety of items at Benvenuto's, including Burgers (large and good), Angry Chicken Pasta (great), Pizza (very good), chicken parm (standard fare), etc...we also enjoy their fresh bread and olive oil which is served before your meal.

Service has always been perfectly fine.  Glasses always full, food served quick, pleasant servers, etc.  We've had one entree that wasn't what we expected.  It was the  bruschetta chicken and unfortunately it had way to much garlic.  We told the server and they quickly brought out a new plate that tasted so much better.

Last night we went for New Year's Eve dinner.  We have an 18 month old, so we're kind of limited on our options.  This place is great as we can get in and out quickly.  We had two great surprises.  Monday night Kid's Eat Free.  So our daughter's meal was free.  Secondly, Monday and Tuesday are half-price bottles of wine...another win for us!

Anyway, don't go to Benvenuto's expecting fine Italian Dining.  There are plenty of great places in Madison for that.  Instead, go to Benvenuto's for good service, a variety of food, and reasonable prices.  

Lastly, for a place that gets such bad reviews, I'm surprised by how busy this very large restaurant gets.  Be prepared for a wait if you get there during prime time on a Friday or Saturday evening."}
{"text":"For a neighborhood Italian place, there's great variety here, from pizzas and sandwiches to fancy entrees. It's a bit pricey for just a weekday dinner out, though. With two pastas, a garlic bread appetizer, and two drinks, you can easily hit $50 (before tip for the wait staff, who are always friendly and helpful). 

Much of the food is traditionally heavily sauced, cheesed, or fried, with not many lighter entree choices. But if that's what you're looking for, it's quite satisfying. Sign up for the rewards club to earn coupons for free appetizers, glasses of wine, and other ways to help with the bill.

I've never had a bad meal here, but I've only ever had one outstanding dish (the seasonal bacon jam scallops risotto, not currently available). Most of the time, the food is just ok. My husband, though, loves the only thing he ever orders, the fettuccini Alfredo. And as I said, the service is great."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  It's a basic Italian-American restaurant so we ordered basic food - their trio dish - lasagna, chx parm and fettuccine Alfredo. Chicken was overcooked and then slathered with so-so sauce and cheese.  Lasagna was really bad and the fettuccine wasn't worth a second bite.  If you can't make these basic dishes, close up shop."}
{"text":"I am really in the middle when it comes to rating Benvenuto's. They have great drinks but the food lacks authenticity and flavor. 

My last visit here, I ordered their Truffle Mac N Cheese and had grilled chicken added. Maybe it was my fault for not reading the menu as well as I should have but my Mac N Cheese had these gigantic size chunks of feta cheese in there. At first, I thought it was chicken until I but into it then realizing it was feta. To me, this was the death of the entree. I would be OK with a few pieces but it was as if the cheese would not stop showing up in them meal. Feta overkill to the max! 

Honestly, I am not sure why they have feta in the dish to begin with. It completely overtook the the taste of any other ingredient. I may order this meal again minus the feta and see if it's better the second time around."}
{"text":"It was my dad's 70th birthday weekend in January. I flew into town to celebrate with our family. My parents don't eat out much, but my mom wanted to plan something grand for my dad's special day and chose Benvenuto. She met with an employee of BV before the big day and spelled out her requests of how she'd like to decorate. The restaurant seemed ready to accommodate.
Unfortunately when we arrived at 4:30, to prep for the party at 5, a baby shower was still in our private back room. They were to have left by 4 but the best excuse we got from the manager was \"It's impossible to get a room of 25 ladies to leave.\" Uhhh, not our problem. But it was - because when no one asked them to leave I ultimately had to speak with their group and politely let them know about our party at 5.
The room was a mess. There was cake on the floor and the room was in shambles. By 4:45 they began to clean up.
All of the careful thought and planning my mom had discussed with BV was forgotten because it was never written down, and her original contact was not there that night. 
In all, the room was clean and decorated by 5:30. We had to detain my dad's friends in the entrance while my mom frantically set things up. She was stressed, my dad was stressed, and it really showed how little this place cared. When my sister asked an employee to vacuum he rolled his eyes at her and said, \"Whatever you'd like.\"

The rest of the night went better and to be fair the food was delicious and everyone had a good time. Our server Michelle was incredibly sweet and nice to us. She didn't even know about the party but seriously saved the day and improved my mom's mood. BV also comp'd two x-large pizza appetizers, which was a nice gesture we appreciated.

But 5 stars goes to Michelle, 4 stars for the food and negative 20 for the stress they gave my family that night."}
{"text":"I had the appetizer sampler. The chicken tenders and curds were awesome. The other stuff was just ok. I also got the Portabella Penne. It was perfect. The Caesar salad that came with it wasn't anything special.

So basically, half the food was ok and the other half was fantastic. I'd give it 4.5 stars, so I'm rounding up. I'm not sure why the ratings are low because this place has some great food."}
{"text":"I had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was great! That's my favorite meal and I'm Italian so I set a high bar for it. The service was absolutely outstanding as well, Jarek did a great job."}
{"text":"Ordered room service while I stayed at the hotel upstairs. 

Their calamari is to die for, their rib eye steak is really good, go for the 16 oz. I added fried shrimp but it was really nothing special, would not suggest the shrimp. 

The tiramisu was the star attraction, in fact one of the best tiramisu I had ever had!! So moist and decadent, a must have!!

All in all they serve some really good food for a family run chain, as close to being authentic as you could get."}
{"text":"When I first came here, the staff was friendly and very attentive. The food we ordered wasn't so good, the fried seafood was very chewy and it also came with soup which resembled vomit. 

Because of the service, I decided to come again and give it another shot. My boyfriend and I had a good lunch, salmon blt and alfredo pasta, but our waiter, Jessica, gave pretty bad service. It was empty besides a couple of people and she always checked up on them and never came to check up on us until she served our food. My boyfriend and I decided to give her a small tip because of the poor service and when we paid in cash, she tipped herself and didn't give back our change. We complained on the survey and they awarded us with a gift card to come back. 

We came back to Benvenuto's after a couple months and they did the exact same thing; took our tip except this time, they gave us some change (the coins) back. 

The only good dish here is the salmon blt do yeahhh, never coming here again."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner tonight. We waited a bit for a table. It was training night with new servers, one of the newbies kept saying to the front folks that we needed to be seated (yay newbie), but it took the fourth server to finally seat is. I hope light bulbs aren't a problem during trading nights, but I digress. Our server apologized for the delay and was nice. 
Partner had the veal parmigiana and I had the chicken parmigiana. It came with soup or salad. We chose the salad after hearing the soup choices- tomatoey something or, hmmm, can't even remember what the second choice was. 
My salad looked like they had mixed old Romaine with new leaf lettuces. Good to spruce things up.? They took care of bringing my plate out as ordered, no cheese and sauce on the side. The veal and chicken were breaded. Partner was able to peel her very salty breading off, and found that all the sauce on the spaghetti was too spicy for her. I wasn't so lucky. The chicken was way too salty, the breading nice and crispy but the chicken inside the light coating adhered to it was just this side of tough. 
We did not order deserts nor did we have other than water to drink. Bill with tip was 40$.
We might go back again for the meatballs, but, meh."}
{"text":"It is ok. It is a really hit or miss. It is not uncommon for pasta dishes to be on the greasy side. I do love the bread and oil that comes out ahead of the mean. The salads are good. My husband enjoyed the salmon."}
{"text":"Quasi Italian.  My husband ordered the shrimp and prime rib, and was happy with his meal. I ordered butternut squash ravioli. They were out at 6pm! I ordered minestrone. It was as thick and gritty as chili. Eggplant parmesan was burnt, and covering it was extra sauce and cheese did nothing to disguise that fact. A new dish was offered and accepted,  but the amount of breadcrumbs overpowered the eggplant. Great service, pleasant manager."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for drinks and snacks after kickball and volleyball on a Sunday afternoon. Beautiful interior, very quiet, nice tap list, a quietly efficient and polite bartender, and tasty apps, all good. Nice way to wind down the weekend."}
{"text":"I gotta admit that I've been into Benevenuto's quite a few times. Their happy hour includes appetizer and $1 off drink specials in the bar area from 3-6pm, every day. Their 23 ounce domestic tap beers are $3 all day, every day. They also offer 1/2 off bottles of wine on Mondays and Tuesdays in the bar or dining room! One thing to note: Their apps are not the healthiest items on the planet though. I suggest you don't ask for the calorie count on any of these items. Sometimes there may be a larger group celebrating in the bar area after a long or hard work day. The bar area can get packed and quite loud pretty quickly. A few of my favorites from the menu include the chicken tenders (quality chicken used), the bruschetta, the cheese bread (must have cheese), the hot supreme sandwich, margherita pizza and the crab cakes.
Ask about their customer rewards membership card. The card can be used to get additional discounts on appetizers, desserts, etc. 
Kids eat free every Monday (up to $5.50 off) with the purchase of an adult entrée. Limited to children 12 and under.
Veterans and individuals with military experience receive a 10% discount off of your entire table. As a thank you for your service, Vets eat free on Veteran's Day! (Some exclusions apply)"}
{"text":"Stayed in the hotel, so didn't really have a lot of choices. Its an ok place if you have to eat while you're staying in Holiday Inn, bar is pretty good.

Service: OK , not the best but definitely better that's some other places 

Food: not good at all, this is why only 2 stars. Pasta was tasteless and greasy . Steak was overcooked and not well prepared at all. 

For the price point definitely not the best choice, but if you just have to eat somewhere then maybe fine"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal here. Pasta is always perfect, the pizza is wonderful and the calzones are huge and excellent. I had my rehearsal dinner here for a pizza party and it was TOP NOTCH. I'm still getting comments about how good the pizza was. The service for that large party and whenever its just the hubby and I has always been great. DO NOT miss the Tiramisu here!"}
{"text":"I came here because I wanted to check it out because I was in the mood for Italian. 

I am usually seated right away. The bread they serve with the olive oil is always yummy. 

I've ordered the spaghetti with meatball once - there was nothing special about the spaghetti. I also ordered the chicken fettuccine Alfredo once. The fettuccine needed more sauce.

There is nothing special about this restaurant but it's good if you are in a bind."}
{"text":"Its ok.
Food is ok but not extrordinary. Basic italian with no standouts.
Service is less refined than the white tablecloth implies. It is quick though. Cheesy risotto was fairly casserole like.
All in all we took food home but really havnt thought about it since. These leftovers will probably be sacrificed to neglect. That should be explanatory."}
{"text":"Here's the deal... that noone has seemed to mention yet.

Benvenuto's delivers. What else do you need know.

Name an italian restaurant that delivers: Benvenuto.

The Cajun Grilled pasta is great as well as there soups. There other more common italian goods are good but you won't get the best lasagna you've ever had here. But you could have it delivered.


Pizza's good.  I mean whatever I'm not a pizza guy but. It's pizza. So,

Pizza was good. 

Ive eaten here almost a dozen times and had picked it up/delivered it every time. Zero mistakes as well.



Also this italian restaurant delivers

Thanks bye"}
{"text":"We had great service, food was great but our night was ruined by the GM coming to our table and telling me I can no longer frequent this location, \"because of your emails, your reviews online, etc.\" She brought the bill over personally, ruined my daughter's celebratory dinner. She asked me snide-like if I got sick, yet, being one of my visits did in fact cause food poisoning and is documented. 

I said, \"I'll take my check\", as she's standing there 
making a fool of herself with family on Skype. This happened to be the same family that was with I mentioned on a previous review.. She 'smacked' my check in my left hand and continued with more unnecessary talk. Pretty unfortunate event.... I turned to my daughter and said, \"These are the people we need to forgive for they know not what they do...or say. Some people can't handle truth.\" 

I almost didn't tip the server but then realized it's not our server that was the issue. Our server was great!"}
{"text":"We go to Benvenuto's a couple times a month after work for drinks. The bartenders are always friendly and efficient.  Such a gem to have on the Northside of Madison."}
{"text":"I ordered lasagna to go. The environment seemed nice; except the unprofessional male waiter with black finger nails and crazy hair. The food was substandard since it was full of salt and the noodles were over cooked. Not impressed :("}
{"text":"The first time or two that I came here I thought it was great. But in the past year or more, I haven't had one good experience.

The food has only been of moderate quality, yet the prices are that of a higher level restaurant. And the service has been horrendous. The last time I was there, our server, after barely attending to us when we were his only table, up and left near the end of our meal. We watched him walk right out the door and drive away without saying anything to us. After about 10 minutes, I grabbed my coat and was ready to walk out. Then the manager finally came over with our bill. It wasn't until after I paid and we were leaving did she tell us that she sent him to their other location.

To abandon your tables without even explaining anything to them is absurd. For management to condone it is even worse. Maybe they don't understand that they need customers to stay in business.

Whatever the case, I won't be wasting my time or money here again."}
{"text":"10 of us from work stopped in with a reservation for lunch, and were seated at a table set for 8.  An hour and a half later we were late for a work meeting, because the service was so slow. Simply getting our drinks was a half an hour.  Then we had to place our order, then 10 minutes to get the bread. So on and so forth. I found the food to be fine. The bread was very tasty as was the soup and my pasta.  Nothing was special, however the salads looked amazing and I think I might go back and give those a try. Basically it just took so long that it was really awkward. I might go back to try the salad and the dessert menu sounded really good, but there's a lot of other places in Madison I would try first."}
{"text":"The food was very delicious and the ambiance was pleasant. A bit overpriced, but very good nonetheless."}
{"text":"This restaurant was once a place my family loved to come, my Dad in particular.  For some reason, it lost favor with him so it had been years since I had been to this North side establishment.

On this date, I had to pick a North-East side location for a dinner with a couple and their young son.  Our original plan fell through and my pal suggested Benvenuto's.  As I got there, the bar was full and looked inviting.  But knowing we would have a toddler, we went into the dining room.  There are both open or intimate tables.  My friends ordered beer and they came in tall glasses.  I was just had iced tea.

We ordered pizza for dinner as it would be the easiest for the little guy.  We had the Bacon Cheeseburger and the Pizza Special of the Day=Chicken Ranch.   Both were tasty but greasy.  My friend laughed at me for eating pizza with a fork and knife.  But I may have had the last laugh as I only went through one napkin to his two or three.  There are better pizzas around Madison but we enjoyed our slices.    Good food but it was the service that really shined.

After a few minutes of little guy in the booth with his Mom, he was put in a high chair.  He tossed his crayons, his drink, his food on the floor every chance he got, and the wait staff were just so awesome about picking things up.  Even when his Mom told them it was okay to leave them, that she would get them, they still were helpful.  We were checked on frequently and I feel we were well taken care of.

Good for families.  Good service.  Good food."}
{"text":"What can I see, it's your typical Italian chain. I've been here 10 times or so and never been disappointed. Prices are fair, service is always good. Huge menu selection with large proportions. 

You're not going to be wowed but you will not leave disappointed or Hungry."}
{"text":"Disappointing delivery.  You dont get everything that you would if you dined in even though the price is the same, for example our $30 prime rib had no bread.  We were told it is unlimited complimentary for dine in only.  Pizza is very good."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I love the Fettuccine Alfredo ANNNDDD the bread! I feel the service has been iffy at times and the prices are expensive but I think overall it's a great place for a fancy dinner with the family."}
{"text":"Went here twice last week with clients. I was very impressed. Had a great salad one day and one of the best pieces of salmon I have ever eaten...and it was extremely affordable and I was very impressed Service was great too. To all of the reviewers that complain that it is not authentic Italian...please remember where you are. The Italian population in WI is like 2 percent"}
{"text":"I've never sat down at this restaurant to eat, but did call them for delivery. We ordered chicken wings appetizer, truffle mac, and a couple other things. The truffle mac was pretty good, very large, very filling and wasn't quite executed as I'd prefer. I actually think Noodles & Co.'s truffle mac was better, but they don't sell it anymore. The onions that were in the cream sauce were still a bit crunchy instead of having been sautéed til nicely soft and caramelized. Maybe they had a new inexperienced kitchen staff member working this day. 
The salad that came with my meal was simple but deliciously perfect. 
The side of French bread was interesting. The crust was covered in a garlic, salt and..... sugar coating??? I don't know. That was a new experience for me. Maybe if the sugar had been added with a very light hand I could have tolerated it, but as it was, it was off-putting and just odd. 
I'll give them another shot one day, but will for sure keep in mind that one pasta entree can easily be shared between a family member and I, and will remember to expect and unusual taste sensation if I decide to try the complimentary French bread."}
{"text":"This place is attached to the Holiday Inn where we have stayed three times now.  It is so nice there is such a great restaurant close by ....we never leave to go anywhere else!   Kids eat free with hotel stay is a great deal.  We have eaten dinner twice there and both times it was amazing.  I had prime rib both times and my husband had lobster ravioli this last visit.  We have ordered the pizza for lunch and it is so good!   We still talk about it when we go home!   Service is great as well."}
{"text":"Seated right away. Staff was excellent, food was filling and tasty. We enjoyed our meal and place was quiet and delivers. Will defitnally go back next time we're in town"}
{"text":"Took friends and family there on 3/1 for a dinner. Service was good, but the food was really disappointing. Steak was not very tender or juicy, penny was slightly better than frozen ones from the grocery store. Bread was sub-par and the olive oil was not served with the bread immediately.

Okay, the price tag is low which I got it, but please improve the food, service is good and I do give good tips. But let me make my point, restaurant was supposed to deliver taste at a top priority."}
{"text":"OK.  It is not a 5-star place.  But I had to give the 5 stars in order to offset the ratings to date.  I went there because the Isthmus Annual Manual said it had great wood-oven pizzas.  I ordered their signature Benvenutos pizza (with ingredients similar to some chain places' \"supreme\") and tap water.

This was an extraordinary pizza.  The crust was explosive, the ingredients were pleasing  (I went to a boutique, Sicilian-personally-owned pizza place in Madison last week - - which I charitably did not rate on Yelp - -  where the otherwise-droolingly-pretty and well-assembled aggregations somehow tasted plain and  DULL - - you have to BUY good basic INGREDIENTS).

The truly odd thing about Benvenutos are the aesthetics.  It is situated on a desperate strip mall, with a hideous bland exterior, that makes you think it is some pretend restaurant, living on pretentions alone.  The pretentions continue as you go to the giant counter.  And then there is this quasi-industrial interior, with huge industrial ceiling-fanned ceilings, cute semi-Vegas-italian- buffet faux-italain scrawlings on the strange pompous facades, all amidst these massive spatial proportions that are wholly intimidating, and make you think you are either in some very, very SPECIAL hallowed unknown reclusive monastery purveying mama's most lustrous home-style concoctions (which you know isn't true), or you are in the most prepostrous strip-mall farce that has ever been created

It's a little of each, but amidst this aggregation of disparate elements, the proof is in the pizza, and the pizza is incredibly good.  A  billowing perfect crust - -  superb textures all around - -  ingredients with satisfying flavor - -  a PERFECTLY constructed pie (texture, flavor, appearance - - you name it).  Nice serrvice.

I'm going back."}
{"text":"Service was really mediocre. Ten minutes to get water and lemonade. Another ten minutes to order. Had the stuffed mushrooms which I was super excited about but they came out raw and cold. Each mushroom was the size of my fist so I knew it would take a minimum of 20 minutes to cook that dish in the oven. We received them after we had finished our soup and entrees ( more on that later) and they were very good. The soup special was a sausage and kale and I enjoyed it very much, shame it isn't on the menu because I would go back for that alone. My entree was disappointing. Had the penne pasta with portobellos and balsamic butter. The pasta was drowned in balsamic and after five bites I just couldn't stand the acidity any longer. I had it wrapped so I could take it home and finish it with a touch of cream. That did make the flavor softer and more enjoyable. I forgot to mention that my mushrooms and artichoke heart were also not cooked thoroughly and at one point I had an ice cold artichoke that I couldn't even bite through. The one bright spot was my friend's truffle mac and cheese. Divine! I will not be returning to this location but will try the Middleton location and order the Mac and cheese for myself."}
{"text":"Great flavor only down side was the temperature of the food when we got it. The server Erin was absolutely the most wonderful and fun person we could have had. The meal took a while to get to us even tho there wasn't many customers."}
{"text":"Very slow service with limited customers. Waited over 10 minutes for someone to come to the table. Food was ok"}
{"text":"I tried ordering with their online service and it doesn't even work, so I had to call them and was told they randomly decided to not deliver to my home address where they've delivered a million times. I spoke to the manager Collin who has the shittiest customer service skills and stated they are too cheap to hire more than 1 driver so they can't deliver to me. I asked what will he do about this and he said nothing. 

I have worked in many restaurants growing up and this is completely unacceptable. Especially for COLLIN THE manager. 

Horrible service for just mediocre food. 

Watching for this place to get shut down. HA HA"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is so good. Staff are polite. Honestly the bread they bring before the meal is amazing, usually my favorite part. I have such a big family so the bill can be pretty expensive, but I still love to go here!!"}
{"text":"I don't know what's happened to this place but it's went all the way down hill.... horrible food experience tonight. The service was not that great especially for being slow. I've had better when it's been packed.  Everyone's salad was brown and wilted. Sent mine back, I think I got the same salad back just moved around a little. Warm beer. Kids each ordered pink lemonade. One was fine the other was undrinkable. My wife's fish (lemon cod I believe ) wasn't fully cooked. My Angry Chicken was good but hardly any chicken. Maybe half a breast. For $18 kinda bs. Are bill was $80?!?! Whatever we won't be back. Use to be a reasonable place to take the family with good food/service."}
{"text":"Their chicken Ceasars salad is prob the best I've ever had.   They add seared lemon halves!  Also.   Pizza is awesome too."}
