{"text":"Used to be a great place but not anymore. I dont know if it is the Original owners or not but the food quality and the service suck now. The last 3 times we ordered from Mona's they forgot half our order and had to call back to get what we paid for. The last time they called back and said that we didnt pay for the order missed and they could resend the delivery guy out again. Sorry, 3 strikes your out"}
{"text":"I ordered food from Mona's Pizza and Pasta online through justeat.ca. I never ended up getting up my food because the number that I talk from day in-day out apparently \"did not exist\" for them. When I told justeat.ca to get in touch with them for my order, they refused to deliver the food to me saying they were too \"busy\". This is after I had made a pre payment and tipped them for my order with my credit card. THIS WAS JUST OUTRAGEOUS, the worst experience I've ever had with a restaurant. I thought I'd give this place a try because its close to my place but never again. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE, I AM SURE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS DISGUSTING AND EXTREMELY RUDE"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in Calgary. Always have had fast delivery and, if you ask, they'll throw in wings or pop."}
{"text":"Like the wings. The pastas are good but the garlic toast is terrible. Pizza is average."}
{"text":"The best Greek salad you'll ever have! The portions are huge for a small price! And it's loaded with cheese and veggies! Wow. The shawarma plate comes all in separate .. I wish it was all in one container and with rice. But i wont complain .. No rice but it was good! Taboule was delish, tahini sauce was fresh and yummy, chicken isn't the shawarma chicken the lebaneese style but it's ok. The best part is the hummus that comes with the meal : what a huge container :-) i love it. It was tasting so good and fresh. I am usually picky when it comes to hummus because it's part of my culture. This one was amazingly well done! I will order again & again from this location! Fully satisfied."}
{"text":"NEW OWNERS. We never had a problem with the previous ones to be clear but new management either way. The food is awesome and they treat us like gold."}
