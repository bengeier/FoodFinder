{"text":"A tiki hut in the middle of Kensington adds a feel that you are having a picnic on the beach in Martinique or Guadeloupe, the French Caribbean.  The food is French Creole.We had the Salt Fish fritters and the shrimp fritters, the salt fish was my favourite with a nice firey hot dipping sauce.   Also had Christophine au gratin, a white squash also kown as Chayote in Central America. Skip the salad with rice, its tasteless and forgetable in both texturea and interest. The Yucca fries were dried out and a dissappointment, and I think a  steamed Yucca would have been more appertizing.
 The best dessert is the Plantain which is perfectly caramalized and just enought sweet enoughtand a hint of cinnamon. 
The owners are delightful, friendly and hardworking but I would suggest they offer come combo dishes such as the salt fish cakes (Accra) with a green salad and one other salad dish and find some more interesting salads that do not have all that rice.  A suggestion would be a cole slaw made with raw grated christophine and carrots with dressed with a lime and oil dressing.
it was fun and interesting."}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful vibe with smiley friendly staff accompanied by reggae. The salt fish cod cakes were excellent as was the coconut flan. The price point here is incredibly reasonable- a great addition to this strip."}
{"text":"So I'm walking through Kensington Market with Jim Halsey and Nash. Jim says: \"I want to eat something different.\"
I laugh and say: \"That's what the Other Guy said!\"
And the Other Guy was right! The French-Caribbean flavour of Le Ti Colibri is a winner. Salt fish, pineapple, sliced beef patties with sluce bish, 12 hour brisket and ham, raisins, apricots, nuts. It's not just tropical, it's CRUCIAL!
Next time I'm bringing Captain Estridge to see what he thinks."}
{"text":"I had a sandwich. Their bread is actually a large round piece of deep fried batter. The bread is quite chewy and flavourful.

Came with lots of lettuce and some fresh tomatoes, and good sauce. Mine had cod in it, and the cod smelled too fishy. I think it was dried or preserved or something, which must be why it was chewier and smellier than the usual cod that comes in a sandwich.

Not my cup of tea, personally. I expected more based on such a high yelp rating.

Also, their back patio smells a big like stale garbage...I'm guessing there is some garbage behind the wooden walls of the patio."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic West Indian food and incredibly friendly service. As a non-vegan, their vegan (and gluten free) options are great. They even went so far as to chase me down to give me the bread I'd forgotten when I left the restaurant. I'll certainly eat there again."}
{"text":"Can you say awesome?  I can!!  Clean, little, new place in Kensington.  Seating only on stools at counters around the place.  Steps up to door and washroom in basement.  Nice paint job, lots of vegan/veg options.

Great french Caribbean music playing, ie. french reggae and rap, very cool, I love to go into an establishment that plays music from it's country of origin.  Definitely good vibrations music.

Everything I tried was awesome delicious.  I bought a deal voucher, otherwise I would not have known this place opened.  I am so glad they had the deal and even happier that I bought it.

First, I started with the codfish fritters.  They were so good, they came with a homemade hot sauce that I wouldn't call hot, but full of flavor and so tasty, yummy.  A little salad came with the fritters, and whatever dressing they made for it was simply delicious.

I had the...  was it cassava? fries.  I think so.  Now for me they were a tinny bit dry, but that's bc there was no vinegar to shake on them.  they young lady didn't even know that us Canadians do that sort of thing and seemed very surprised when I asked for some.

Then I had a sandwich, it was the cod, avocado and something, I forget... but no matter, it was so damn good.  I couldn't stop telling the owners how good it was while I was eating it.  the homemade bread, was so good, it was an enormous deep fried bun, kind of like a West Indian dumpling but softer.

I ordered the sorrel, ginger drink, uh... yum.  It was a perfect balance of ingredients.  Once again...homemade.

For dessert, the pineapple cake.  It was an individual upside down pineapple cake, it came to the table warm, mmmm.  It was moist, a cross between fluffy and spongy but not quite either, so what does one call it?  Frickin' good, that's what I call it.  And where was this tasty cake made, well in house, of course.

All of that cost me $25.  an app, main, side, drink and dessert.  totally worth every penny and a generous tip.

The owners are a friendly, young couple, one from Guadeloupe and one from Martinique, who will be happy to help you practice your french.  I watched them prepare some things while I was there and all the little steps of chopping what looked like the hot sauce, was done by hand.  A lot of love is put in the food here and I think you will taste it in every bite.

They prefer you bring cash instead of credit card.  It's a mix between counter and service."}
{"text":"I was finally able to try this place out. The food is quite tasty and does pack some heat if you get the hot sauce. We tried the creole platter which had salt fish fritters and saltfish dumplings with salad on the side. I loved the salad, very tasty! The fritters were tasty as well but oily. 
We also got the saltfish avocado burkitt sandwich with casava fries. Lots of flavor, though the fries were a little too hard for my preference. 

Overall good meal but a little on the oily/deep fried side. They need to offer more fresh options"}
{"text":"Excellent french caribbean food. Me and my girlfriend had the Augusta sandwich, which is made with hot fried bread, avocado, cod, tomato and lettuce. The staff is very, very kind - and genuine."}
{"text":"Great little caribbean spot with friendly service and nice patio in the back.  I went here with a friend that bought a voucher for me as a birthday gift.  I ordered the 'Le Augusta' sandwich and it was divine.  Served hot, with the bread made on the spot.  Very tasty with lots of flavour.  I had a glass of house made sorrel to wash it down and it was refreshing delicious on a hot summer day.  As mentioned, we used a voucher that was purchased for my birthday.  The staff was so nice they gave us some pineapple cake as a birthday treat.  If you're in the Kensington neighbourhood looking for something a little different than the burrito and mexican spots around, I definitely recommend trying Le Ti Colibiri."}
{"text":"I hate writing this because I've never actually gotten to try the food, and I've attempted multiple times. This is additionally quite bizzare because I live up the street and used to go all the time when it was Indo Pak.

They state their hours are open until 8pm, but I've tried entering the business to order at 7:30pm and have been told they're closed. This is after I walked in their open door, after standing outside contemplating the menu for a while, trying to decide what to get (this was also the third or fourth time attempting to eat there). They could have easily told me they were closed when I was outside, or had the door closed, versus having me wait in a line of just myself for another few minutes just to deny me service!

The worst part is I don't think I'm the only one this happens to. Just yesterday, I saw a woman rapping on the door at 6:30pm, but the lights were out and maybe nobody was home. I hope that hungry woman survived.

I'm not the type to usually complain about this stuff (see my other reviews) and am fine with variable, flexible, or adjusted hours - JUST LET ME KNOW/POST A SIGN!

The TTC gives me enough trust issues by not showing up on time!"}
{"text":"First time here, so what should I order?

I asked for recommendations and was willing to try anything representative of French Caribbean food.  

The cod and avocado sandwich was really good.  The bread was freshly made.  The fritters were pillowy soft and I wanted more.  They came with a mini-side salad garnish which was a nice touch.  That hot sauce served with the sandwich and fritters gave a real kick to the food (ate every drop).  The sorrel drink was refreshing and flavourful.  

Given this was my first introduction, it was a pleasant surprise.  Friendly and helpful service.  They offer catering too!  

Since everything is made fresh to order, you might have to wait a bit, but well worth it.  

Note: There is a patio in the back and it's under construction."}
{"text":"French Caribbean food. More vegetarian with fish sort of menu. The food was delicious but I do find the portions to be a bit small. The staff are lovely."}
{"text":"We ate a very unique and delicious sandwich here.  They roll their dought out in front of you, and deep fry the dough fresh right as you order.  A homemade spicy sauce along with fresh tomato, romaine lettuce, and literally fresh cut avodacdo along with any type of meat/fish you like -we had vegetarian beef.  So many interesting flavors in the sandwich, but most impressive was the spicy sauce.  The best part was easily the bread.  Nothing better than non-sweet deep fried dough."}
{"text":"Dropped by this place today had the codfish fritter, stuffed crab, calaloo, fries and salad. All items were fresh, well prepared and tasty. We sat in the back patio as indoors is counter seating only.  I highly recommend this place for a quick bite to eat. Would be even better if they had a liquor license."}
{"text":"We love coming to Kensington for the great food options. This is one of those original and authentic holes in the wall. The food is made fresh in front of you and is delectable. Probably not a good dieting option but that's not why we're here now right?
Sandwiches are really tasty. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place! 

1) Food: Absolutely delicious. One of my favorite menu items is the cod and avocado sandwich. The callaloo and cod combo plate, served with plantains is also delicious. I have had many different items on the menu and I have never been disappointed.

2) Service: The service is always friendly and consistent. It is clear that the staff care about the customers and are interested in providing both product information and a positive experience to those that come in.  

My only complaint is that I wish it was a bit bigger! On a busy day it can be hard to cop a seat!

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"French Caribbean food has hit the Market! This little takeout place (seasonally dine-in, hit that patio now!) has a menu that looks to be largely seafood based. This is probably due to the fact the chef is a pescetarian (he's cooked for a couple of Toronto's favourite vegetarian restaurants, including Urban Herbivore). 

I'm not a huge fan of seafood but my sweet tooth was craving, so ordered fruit punch and plantain and hit the back patio. 

PATIO was decorated with bamboo and plants for that island feel, which would be corny but for the ramshackle assortment of rickety tables and benches and the feeling that this place is the real deal.  

JUICE was incredible, fresh and cool and as sweet as natural fruit juice can be. A lovely couple piped in, \"Isn't this place GREAT? If only we had rum in these drinks!\" 

PLANTAIN was sprinkled with brown sugar and lime zest. I was silently making a huge deal about how good this was by nodding my head vigorously, so much so that a man from another table approached us. We offered him a bite, and he agreed the lime zest was wicked! He also explained to me how to cook prepare my own plantains to get either a savoury or sweet dish.

I wish I liked seafood because there were these sandwhiches on deep fried buns and these little croquette lookin things that looked DOPE. 

Best part about this place is the vibe... from the moment we sat down, we were chatting with other patrons. WILL RETURN. YOU SHOULD COME AND REVIEW THE FISH!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.

Had salted cod fritters as an appetizer and a vegan sandwich.

The fritters were good but I have this memory of my mom's fritters and it was not as good! The sandwich was really good as well.

Owners are nice! I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Wow, this place turns out tasty food. 

I've been twice for the Vegetarian Sandwich and it's absolutely fantastic. I guess when you deep-fry dough and stuff it with tasty veggies and TVP it's hard to go wrong, but I've never had anything like this before. Definitely worth checking out when you're in the market. Blasts any sandwich at Urban Herbivore out of the water. 

The atmosphere is lacking but who cares with food this good? (except I've heard great things about the back patio, haven't been in the summer yet). 

Sandwich is big enough for two to share if you aren't really really hungry!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were out strolling around Kengsington Market when we decided to grab a bite to eat. She spotted this quaint little restaurant and walked in as we both love caribbean food. This isn't your typical caribbean restaurant. I believe the owners/chef hail from Guadeloupe (still a colony of France) and the cuisine is quite different from what I have been used to.

Their menu consists of either vegetarian or seafood options. We ordered the following, though I'm not sure of their actual menu names: fruit punch, shrimp and scallop fritters, sandwich consisting of fish and guacamole. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of seafood, but man those were one of the best, if not THE best shrimp fritters I've had. I would never have thought that guac and fish paired well, but that sandwich changed my perception of that. Everything on our dish was so flavorful, spicy but not overpowering. As another reviewer stated, the fruit punch was out of this world; quite difficult to go back to the store bought punch from concentrate after having this.

I really loved their patio as it gave us the feeling of being in the islands. The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 stars was that the interior of the restaurant wasn't quite well done, and space is quite limited. To get to the patio, one has to walk through their storage/dishwashing area. They had just opened the restaurant about a month back, so I'm sure once they are settled in they can perform the necessary renos. 

Would highly recommend to check out this restaurant if you are in the general area! Typing this review is making me quite hungry now..."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from someone and was excited when I passed by the Kensington Market. 

Food: I ordered fish sandwich and a homemade drink(had ginger in it). The sandwich was big and delicious! The homemade drink had a tiny amount of sweetness, which I enjoyed. 

Service: A friendly young man suggested some things to try. His recommendations did not disappoint! 

Vibe: It felt cozy and intimate(the place was small), but at the back, there is an outdoor patio. 

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
Again, another place I didn't knew existed in Kensington Market but a great find! I love, love, love the back patio here. It has a tiki hut with a dash of ramshackle. There's reggae music playing in the background and it brought back memories of when I was in St. Kitts. 

A note about the bathroom: The light for the bathroom is at the top of the stairs. Yes, I navigated a dark bathroom with my iphone...

WE ATE 
The shrimp fritters were fantastic and the hot sauce is a medium (I like mild, usually). The sauce does have a bit of \"kick.\" 

I really liked the cocunut, tuna quiche. It was delicious and hearty! 

The sandwiches have a lot of bread/dough to them. I wasn't as big of a fan but if you're hungry this is the place to come. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK
I won't remember the name of this place but I will remember the food. Very island style. Fun place in bohemian Kensington Market!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoyed the shrimp fritters and tuna coconut fish. Absolutely DELISH!"}
{"text":"Parfait endroit ou se ressourcer dans une ambiance antillaise que jadore. Et le tout dans le quartier que jadore de kensington market ! 
Il faut oser passer le pas le pas de la porte pour découvrir ce petit endroit caché, une terrasse a lantillaise. Sous l'air d'une musique créole. Concernant les repas proposés cela est tres original (les fameux sandwich) un peu gras a mon gout. Mais etant partie sur les îles cest ainsi ou presque que l'on mange. Par contre jai adoré les plateaux !
 A découvrir."}
