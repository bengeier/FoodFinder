{"text":"J'aurais vraiment aimé donné un excellent review à cet endroit parce que le potentiel est incroyable: Situé à deux pas du Centre Bell avec une déco parfaite pour le genre et un arrangement tables/bars/TV/Écrans géants excellent... La première chose que je me suis dit en entrant est: \"Wow, un match des séries des Canadiens ici doit être insaaaane! On a trouvé notre sport pour nos soirées sportives!\"  Le très gros problème de l'endroit, comme il est décrit dans plusieurs autres reviews, est le service...  Nous étions un mercredi soir, l'endroit est environ 30% plein et ça nous a quand même pris 30 minutes pouvoir enfin commander à boire... et il a fallu faire signe au serveur pour finalement avoir son attention....  Mon ami me racontait qu'à sa dernière visite, il y avait plusieurs erreurs dans les commandes et c'est exactement ce qui s'est passé pour nous aussi... Mauvais plat, extra oublié, etc.  Déjà, j'étais plus ou moins convaincu de l'endroit qu'à ma très grande surprise, un peu après 22:00, le serveur vient nous voir pour nous annoncer que c'était le \"last call\"! 30 minutes plus tard, toutes les lumières étaient allumées et c'était fini.... à la prochaine la gang?  C'était la première fois que je voyais un resto et/ou bar fermer si tôt alors qu'il restait encore tout de même beaucoup de clients à l'intérieur alors pour le concept resto/bar sportif... on repassera! :("}
{"text":"My recommendation is to eat before you arrive. The TVs are cool... very well designed, but everything else was no bueno. The food took a VERY long time, very poor quality, the staff is extremely kind and pleasant but very confused.  I'll come back in a few months and see if they made any improvements."}
{"text":"Think of this place as a station de sport but much much fancier. The food is very good, a bit pricey, not sports bar prices tho. When we went the place was preatty empty. The waiter told us that January and February they close earlier because there are not a lot of clients. The giant screen is amazing. I would definitely recommend this place to watch an important match. They have almost all the channels in the world. It should be packed in the summer with the World Cup."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the Montreal sports bar scene, which frankly is pretty lacklustre.   The decor at 1909 is terrific and of course includes an abundance of TV's. One of which is about two and a half stories tall and boast a spectacularly crisp picture.   You might be caught off guard slightly when entering the resto. When you come in off the street you enter a space that feels more like the entryway to a condo than a restaurant, but you are in the right spot. We were greated by the hostess who directed us to the elevator bank (used exclusively for the restaurant) and we headed DOWN to enter the restaurant.   Other than being an excellent sports bar, which over three floors provides a multitude of different areas from which you can watch the game. 1909 also has good food. We tried the onion rings, chicken wings and tacos, which came with fries. The portions were generous and everything was really tasty. The Friedman were particularly good! This is great as the food available at many of the other sports bars in town is not even suitable for being fed to my dog. Keeping in mind that we were there the second or third day after they opened, my only comment was that the food came out lukewarm. I'm sure that they will overcome this in the coming days or weeks."}
{"text":"NEW Resto-Bar, has 1200 seating places. The 1909 Taverne Moderne has 3 floors, the main one (1 beautiful bar) and 2 sous-sol, where there is a IMAX screen that you could see from both floor. When you are heading downstairs, you do not feel like you are going underground, the way they decorated the place is beautiful, they really did a great job. There is a tv screen everywhere you turn and bars all over the place.  Food wise, I tried some appetizers to share, classique nachos and chicken wings, both were very good. Alcohol wise, the drinks were perfect, they have a very big selection of beer and my friends that drink beer said it was awesome.  Service was great, staff is friendly. Thank you to our server Terry, he made us have a great evening. Hope this place makes it way in Montreal, it has a lot to offer."}
{"text":"Positive: I had a great time with my friends, in a very classy atmosphere for a sports bar concept.  Negative point: You have noticed that I did not mention the food, or even the drink or the service ... Well, guess what? There weren't any! I'm going to sound blasé about this, but I'm a bit tired of those places that are all about design and hype and forget about the basics ... Yes, people go there to watch games on big screens, but hum eventually to drink and eat too, right?   We arrived at 5 and the place was. not. full... At all. Our waitress asked if we wanted a drink, took our orders and informed us that another colleague in training would be working with her that night. I ordered the cocktail of the day and apparently, they understood that I wanted a glass of ice because it is exactly what I was served ... I would have liked to order food but hum... nobody came back to our table! Got caught up in our conversations and realized that 1 hour had passed and nobody came to take our friend's order (she arrived a little late) and ours, so we got the attention of a waiter, who told us that it is not his sector but that our waitress would be back shortly ..... 30 minutes later, since no one came by we asked for our bills. Then there was a little confusion on their part as hum the waitress came to take our orders (finally!!), then the manager came and asked if something was wrong, we explained the situation and she offered us the \"drinks\". I will not be returning at least not before a very long time as they are clearly still in their running-in phase."}
{"text":"- Partie de Gatineau avec 2 amies pour aller essayer le restaurant 1909! Très belle accueille a notre arrivée par l'un des gérants, celui-ci nous a très bien expliqué ou aller s'assoir pour être devant l'immense télé! .. La serveuse sympathique, connais son affaire et le menu, nous conseil même certain choix \" d'a coté \" pour aller avec notre repas! J'ai pris un mojito pour boire et il était bon..  Mon repas principal était un Tartare de Saumon, déjà là, le tartare a lui seul a value le 5 Étoiles!  Ce n'était pas un soir d'événement(mercredi soir) nous étions environ 60-70 clients dans tous le restaurant! Un petit bonus avant notre départ, M. Claude Julien était assis directement devant nous, alors nous en avons profité pour une photo!  Bref super beau restaurant,personnelle sympathique, qui connais son affaire! Je n'hésiterais pas a refaire 2h de route pour y retourné! Bonne continuité!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but $70 was steep. We asked for onion rings instead of french fries. Paid an extra fee of $3 to get only three small onion rings. Wtf! Our first night experience was good, but the second night left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Absolute crap, a zero on all levels. Service, food ambiance as bad as the Habs this year"}
{"text":"We are on our way to attend a concert: Tribute to Leonard Cohen: Tower of song. Since we are early; we decided to to have a sit down dinner. This is only restaurant we found nearby.  It's beautiful inside, we got seated at long table on high chairs.   Our waiter was really friendly and enthusiastic. I loved his energy. My friend ordered a vegetarian burger with fires and I ordered salmon tartare with polenta. Both dishes were exquisite.  The service was slightly slow, but the ambiance was good."}
{"text":"Good spot for sport events and drinks. Lots of open space, huge screen (probably biggest I seen in a restaurant) and good drinks variety. Food is overpriced and subpar. 30$ burger not worth it, fries are not cooked properly, oysters Rockefeller style were disgusting, nachos by far the saddest nachos I've seen (not enough garnish not enough nothing). Onion rings were good but then again 5 pieces for 10$ is excessive. Service is hit and miss, sometimes takes long before you see waiter again, perhaps understaffed for the 1200 seats..."}
{"text":"On the 25th of April 2018, several universities collaborated to organize a social event for a conference taking place in Montréal. After careful considerations and months of planning, we decided to rent the lower level B3 in 1909 Taverne Moderne. Our contract included access to the location for max 600 people from 7:00 PM until 1:00 AM, over 900 drink tickets valid throughout the night, a variety of food and snacks and access to the wall displays to advertise our work.  Everything started out fine when we, the organizers, arrived at 6:00 PM to setup our material and discuss the events of the evening. The wall displays were functional and the food was being setup.  However, the first conflict arose around 7:00 PM when we were told that the level above us had rented the big screen to watch the hockey playoffs. As our event was supposed to be a social event, the loud noise of the hockey match was not something we had anticipated. We did come to an arrangement where the volume was lowered and during breaks the music was put on again. I would suggest the venue to inform organizers of such conflicts beforehand.  Somewhere between 10:00 and 10:30 PM, the head of security, which turned out to be the owner, informed us that he found the room was full and that we were not allowed to let more people in. At that point, our Eventbrite system reported a total of less than 400 attendees, more than 200 less than initially agreed upon. This resulted in us having to deny registered people access to the venue. More conflict with the head of security arose when we did decide to allow entry to one of the professors partially paying for the event as he arrived a bit late. By the time we reached an agreement to allow more people access to the venue, most had gone already and those wanting to come were stopped at the front door by an additional security guard.  Around 10:45 PM, we were informed that the drink tickets would not be valid after 11:00 PM. We were not able to solve this issue with the head of security while he informed attendees of his decision through the microphone. Additionally, he started discussing that the event could not last until 1:00 AM as they usually close much earlier. To add to the confusion, the same person started arguing that attendees were not paying enough tip and that we, the organizers, should mitigate this.  After long discussions, one of our professors had to intervene. By looking over email conversations and the signed contract, the only consensus we were offered, was to allow drink tickets again for half an hour, of course without informing attendees through the microphone.  Luckily, most of the people in the venue did not notice the discussions and had a great time. While the waiters and waitresses did a great job and both the food and drinks were very good, we are saddened by the unnecessary conflicts that took place between the organizational team and the head of security. Nobody wants to get out their laptop to go through each and every email during an event at 11:00 PM after a hard day at a conference.  Usually, one might forsee these kinds of situations by explictly stating every detail in the contract. However, the agreements clearly described in the contract, were not upheld."}
{"text":"Je suis allé un vendredi soir. Le resto bar avait en effet beaucoup de place et offrait une variété de bière. Cependant, la cuisine et la bar à cocktail avaient de la difficulté à imprimer les commandes cette soirée là et ils fallait souvent faire un suivi de nos commandes."}
{"text":"This is for the restaurant in Downtown. We had a special screening for the World Cup, no reservations were to be taken.  They took them, though.  When arriving, the hostess was terribly arrogant and I was told that since I didn't have a reservation and it was just one person, I had no choice but to sit on the bar.  I met my friends who were inside and I stayed there for two hours: Didn't get a glass of water, let alone what I ordered (there was not enough food, apparently) On top of that, the waitress was following me with the bill (?!) Extremely poor management for an event that was requested at least a month in advance."}
{"text":"Watched the Habs 8-3 victory over the Sens on 30/10/17. Best TV for sports in the city, but the food and service falls way short of the high prices. They only recently opened so hopefully it's just a matter of working out the kinks. Montreal needs a great sports bar, but so far, this isn't it."}
{"text":"For all the money that was spent on design and construction its incredible this place has so many flaws.   The TV is way too big. Its hard to watch it.   The rest of the TVs in this place are situated in such awkward places it makes it difficult to watch a game if your not looking at the big TV.  This place has no identity. I was there with a group of 10 people watching the World Series - get this, they dont play the audio unless its for habs games. Who are these guys running the show? Everyone is watching the game but forced to listen to ridiculous / terrible music. Typical Molson / Montreal garbage. What a pathetic sports scene...they will play the audio for the 2-6-1 Habs but not for an epic Game 2 of the World Series on a nite where the Habs were NOT playing. Everyone there wanted the audio and was watching the game...in the end we left after eating to watch at Cage.   There were other good games (Raps v Warriors) on but this place had the Monday nighter between Eagles and Redskins on repeat (it was Wednesday nite) playing on the other half of the screens. Management sitting with their heads in their _____.   On a side note, our waitress was great and worked hard to get us the audio - which she succeeded in doing for an inning- before management switched it back to music.  If you want to watch a game go to Cage aux Sports. And if your not watching a game there is no point coming here . The service staff were very nice and sympathetic, the food is pricey yet mediocre and the ambience is just bizarre. This place doesn't know what it is...definitely not worth going out of your way for a group get together w friends when you dont need to be downtown. With 2 floors closed, the place has a hollow vibe to it. They think they are a club w music/DJ, they pitch themselves as a sports bar....truth is, they dont know what they are and thats the biggest problem."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new place so it has its positives and negatives. The location itself is huge and well laid out with lots of room for groups and huge screens for sporting events. The place has a great lively energy without being too loud and is in a great location close to the bell centre. We came here with a group of coworkers and loved the ambience. Our waitress was very friendly and did come and check in on us frequently. However , the prices were way too high especially when it comes to the food. They charge way too much for small portions of food where the quality is mediocre at best : arancini way overcooked, bland and soggy poutine , stale nachos and tasteless small burger with a stale bun. The menu comes off as elevated gourmet bar food but the portions are small and the quality of the food is just not there at all which doesn't help to justify the prices. Their old fashioned was small and just okay and the beer was good but slightly pricey and we weren't offered/didn't notice any happy hour specials. Overall this place has a lot of potential but they absolutely need to do something about the food and maybe slight pricing adjustments. I really hope I can come back here at some point and be able to give a better review !"}
{"text":"I came here Friday night with some friends. We were 7 people and the service was pretty slow. I was expecting a slower service because it was busy on a Friday night but some of my colleagues came for lunch a couple of weeks ago and the service was fast even though they were 20 people.   Now I know it was a pretty busy night but it was taking long for the waitress to bring beer and sangria which is simple enough to get. We are polite so we waited for everyone at the table to get their drinks before we each started to drink and we waited again for everyone to get their food before eating. Needless to say there was a lot of waiting around and we were thirty and hungry.   My bf and I had a Bloody Caesar each and it was pretty good and salty. I ordered another one after that which came very fast and then got a Blanche beer (Kronenbourg 1664)later on.   For food I got the salmon tartare with fries. The salmon tartare had sesame oil and tempura. Its not mayo based. It was ok. Ive had better tartare elsewhere. It wasn't as fresh as I would have liked it to be. The fries were good though. They were salty,  long and crispy.    I took a bite of my boyfriend's chicken sandwich. The chicken was breaded and inside the sandwich was arugula, confit garlic aioli, and tomatoes. My boyfriend didn't really like it. I felt it was just ok. He much preferred the burger that he had there for lunch a couple of weeks ago.   This resto-bar would be fun to go to watch a Habs game. It has the biggest tv screen I've ever seen. It's pretty impressive!"}
