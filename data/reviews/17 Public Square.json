{"text":"Three of us had dinner here this week and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The chef was kind enough to make us some cheese curds even though they were only on the Happy Hour menu and it was later than applicable.  And they were delicious!  My son lives in Madison WI, the home of cheese curds so I've had my share.  Two of us had burgers, very juicy and cooked as ordered, very good.  Our companion had a salad which was fresh and delicious.  The lighting is much better than it had been in the previous restaurant that was here and the renovations they have done made it feel more spacious and open.  A beautiful old historic building, this is a great spot to meet with friends and enjoy a good meal at a reasonable price.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place so took my mom. my sister, and niece here.. from the moment walked in started off on wrong foot.. hostess was not pleasant.. seemed like we were bothering her..

no booths. that is fine. my mom is 87 years old though and easier for her with booths.. but anyway..

two burgers, salmon, and steak ordered.. steak, ordered medium was very dry.. for $ 34 to say it was underwhelming would be an understatement.  burgers.. also overcooked.. salmon, undercooked..

wait was long for the food,  had to ask for bread for my mom's salmon dinner.. overall not a good experience at all.."}
{"text":"Nothing to go crazy over. The menu is pretty pricey for the portions and quality of food you get. I got the asiago chicken sandwich and it tasted kind of like it was a microwaved patty with good toppings. Someone else got the tacos and those looked pretty good. Kids meal is $8 and you only get three very small chicken tenders and about 8 or 9 steak fries in the chicken finger meal. The waitress will not give you more ice when she refills your water unless you ask. So make sure you ask for more ice before she pours room temperature water into your cup - not very refreshing. 

The lay out and interior of the place is cute. Way better than the place that was there before. But they need to step up their quality of service and food if they want to charge what they do."}
