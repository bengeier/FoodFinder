{"text":"This place rocks.  I went on Monday night and  The service was so fast and friendly,  we sat outside with a heater and had the best time with our waitress who suggested the best drinks..  I think mine was called El jefe or something but it was sooooo great. And they have slushies we got to sample some flavors which was so fun mmmm watermelon was my favorite.  I think for a late night kick back after partying all day this place is the spot.. I can see it being fun for summer and sports they have TVs everywhere.  Hope when we come back we can have the same waitress she was the nicest most fun server we have had here on our trip. Everyone seems so grumpy and she  had us laughing and smiling the whole time. definitely helped her tip."}
{"text":"Great service and food, the bartender Joe was amazing with our group for a bacheloret party all the way from long beach!!! Thank you fatbar and Joe ;)"}
{"text":"Make sure you get your 2 for 1 drink cards from the street promoters. This is a full bar. Kids are welcome at tables or inside. The food is great. There's sweet potato fries not on the menu. Breakfast is great too. Veggie burgers are fantastic!! The Slushy bar sells alcoholic slushys. NOT kid friendly!! Do not give these to your children!!"}
{"text":"This place fucking sucks it's a very expensive virgin slushy .......... Or someone forgot to put the alcohol in the mix because I drank a whole half yard and don't feel anything"}
{"text":"Always hit this spot at least once per visit to Sin City. Great burgers and I also enjoy a breakfast burrito if I head there in the morning (ish). Geo and Tamar always treat me and my posse like family!"}
{"text":"We stopped here as we walked down the strip to grab some slushies and souvenir cups. (I'm a tourist, not ashamed.)   Two girls in skimpy outfits were working, not surprising for Vegas. They had horrible customer service, though. Sorry I don't have a dick, but I still know how to tip when someone earns it.  They let us sample, which was nice.  I am pretty sure the drinks didn't have alcohol.... I could be wrong, but it seemed like we wasted $20 on something we could have gotten at the 7/11 next door for $2. They didn't ID us (not too surprising), but there also wasn't a liquor license posted.   Not pleased, won't be going back."}
{"text":"The burgers are BIG and very good good place to eat sucks you gotta buy everything separate but overall good got a free shot with \"yelp\" app"}
{"text":"I have to post more than just #omnomnom but that's really it in a nutshell.  We went inside first where the hostess tried to sign us up for some site tour (yeah, right, 2 girls in Vegas for 3 days...shuuuuuuuur I have time to see your hotel) but we went outside and sat at the bar.  We were able to each customize our burger to our wants.  Shared some fat fries and each got a HUGE Miami Vice.  I have a pretty high tolerance but this actually made me take a nap =)  I highly recommend as an alternative to run of the mill burger joints, though it does cost a little bit more."}
{"text":"Best Burger on the strip. Our server Mallory was amazing. Super energetic and told us about all the options and specials for beers and cocktails."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place.  Yummy Fat Burgers with Booze.  How cool is that?   The only bad thing about this place is that out door bar is not suitable for Heat.  Yes they have misters outside but it is so freaking Hot and miserable if you eat out there. They do have indoor seating but not as cool of an atmosphere.  We had a really sweet waitress she was on top of things.  We also got some 2 for one drinks so we definitely got our moneys worth.  The food was above average or maybe I was just really hungry but I left here melting and satisfied :-)"}
{"text":"I went there wii my friends to have a drink and we sat by ourselves and for minutes and minutes nobody came to even say hi so we approached to the bar and stayed there until the rude bartender decided to come just to say he was not gonna take our order until he could and yeah literally he did , he didn't take our order or anything , horrible service , no manager , mean and rude employees"}
{"text":"Best place to grab a quick bite or people watch in the summer with the misters on and umbrellas out! Alcoholic slushes in souvenir cups and 2 for 1 at the bar with promoter cards. Such a fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is the best people watching spot on the Strip. I sat  behind the glass fence and watch a non stop parade of people from all over the world. As I ate the best burger I've had in a long time I became fascinated with the non stop march of humanity on the other side of the glass. People who walk the strip come from everywhere. What distinguishes them from other busy streets is they are only there to have a good time. I watched family groups of all demographics pass before me. I saw small and large groups of people. It was fascinating to link the families as they spent 90 seconds passing. I felt safe behind the glass and yet very close to the people who walked 6 feet away from me.   Service was excellent and fast.  They have a full bar and the food selection mostly is burgers and fries. I had a really well made turky burger and a surprisingly good salad. My friend had a XL burger with cheese bacon and egg. They say the egg was added when someone didn't know whether to order breakfast or dinner. It was great.   They have many large screen TVs showing sports and a super sound system playing music to suit the location. open  24 hours and amazingly they has plenty of free parking even though everyone else on Strip charges $10 on up   If you are on the Strip and want a great burger while you watch the world walk by: this is your spot"}
{"text":"I don't give out many one stars but when I do you know they deserve it. Let's begin with the flies everywhere. Cycle the garbage folks. Then the shitty service. Its not a fast food counter ladies grow a personality. I order a whiskey neat and get ice. Okay take a bartending class too. Finally, don't play SEC football west of the Mississippi. Lasg time I checked Nevada is not a KKK state and half Vegas tourists are from Cali. Play some Pac 12 asshats. Fatburger is from Cali. Have some dignity"}
{"text":"Since the Fat Burgers in Illinois all closed, I was thrilled to be able to walk out of the Aria and see a Fat Burger -with a bar - that we could have lunch at while sitting outside.  We also got hit with the \"2 for one\" drink tickets, so make it a burger, a chicken sandwich, some fried and two fat tire.  All this for under $30.  Yum!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been vacationing in Las Vegas for a week now and are flying home tonight. We have been to Fatbar at least once a day our entire vacation. They have absolutely super consistent great service. An especially big thank you to Joe, Rolan and Johnny for taking care of us and being really great at your job! It's not easy working in food service but you guys do it with class! BTW, the food is great also!! Get the wings and chili cheese fries with a side of hot sauce... you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Got a groupon for 2 of the 50 oz alcoholic slushies and an order of Fat Fries. For the price we paid they were well worth it. My girlfriend's was Passion fruit flavored and she said it was tasty. Mine was vodka flavored. Well, it was supposed to be Blue Raspberry. It was blue, that's for sure. It was not raspberry, it only taste like vodka.  I guess that's not a complaint. I felt afterwards like I had drank half a bottle of vodka. Good thing I didn't have anything else to drink beforehand. I'm not sure why mine was so much stronger. Made my night pretty inexpensive alcohol-wise, which is always good. The service was decent. Seems at this place they at least let the female waitresses choose how much skin they want to show, which is good. Some were wearing short shorts and \"FatBar' bras, others were wearing t-shirts and regular shorts.  They of course had the expected eye candy. The two most scantily-clad servers luring people into the bar. I'm always confused how \"Fat\" and \"Sexy, skinny servers\" get connected. Same as how just up the road Heart Attack Grill serves heart-stopping burgers from skinny women to 350 pound men for free. Oh well, it's beyond me."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying that Fat burger is the best burger and  inside the service has always been amazing, but here at Fat bar the service is horrible.  We sat for over 10 minutes and didn't get a waitress until I asked for one. They walked by and looked at us, but not a word. I will always come back because of the food, but the service outside made me realize it's best to eat inside. They have plenty of staff and it's not busy so there is no excuse. They staff spends too much time socializing with eachother.  A couple of them must be dating because they were kissing in the corner by our table and didn't even care that we were sitting waiting. Horrible way to run a business."}
{"text":"Modelo on Tap!!!! Bartenders are super friendly and hold good convos. Great Job Jorge!!! Outstanding service"}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick meal, plus they are open 24 hours. Check in on your Yelp app and get a free shot! Staff here is quick and tentative. Not a lot to choose from on their menu...I mean, this IS a burger joint. But the burger itself was not greasy and the fries were nice and crispy. All in all a decent meal for $10+  They have indoor and outdoor seating at the bar and it never seems too overly crowded. Lots of various drinks and specials to choose from!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, great environment, kind of pricey for the food. I guess that's a natural in Vegas"}
{"text":"Great burgers on the strip!  Eat outside and enjoy the sights and sounds of the Las Vegas experience.  One of the few places you can get a burger with a fried egg in it... give it a try!"}
