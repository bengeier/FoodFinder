{"text":"Pho was good.  Place was very busy and seemed they didn't have enough staff to cover all the tables. 

I usually go to Saigon Noodles but they were closed this day, which gave me an opportunity to try this place.  Worth giving a try if in the area."}
{"text":"Food is average. Service is bad... really rude! I have tried much better pho places before. Won't come back."}
{"text":"Great place for quick pho take out!  I love the fresh spring rolls and the Thai Iced Tea!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Pho.  I had it every weekend growing up.  I grew up just outside \"Eden Center\" in Northern Virginia, which is the Vietnamese hub of the East Coast.  Oh, and I'm half-Vietnamese.  I think that gives me a lot of credit for this.

My wife and I gave this place two tries.  We really wanted to try to like it, I swear.  I always want \"my peeps\" to do well.  The decoration is nice.  Service is passable.  But all the other food sans the pho is barely passable.  

It clearly isn't authentic Vietnamese, but I also don't think they are trying to do \"authentic.\"  They are making relatlvey bland Vietnamese food palatable to most, and I think they generally succeed, but this is NOT the place I would go if you wanted to show your friend \"Vietnamese food.\"

Their Pho is average.  If you're craving pho and this is the only place in town I would go here.  Otherwise I cannot recommend this place.

The rest of their dishes, be it their Vermicelli or their Rice dishes, are less than adequate.

Again, I want this place to succeed, but personally will not be coming back here.  Saigon noodle is by far your better bet, though unfortunately they are a victim of their own success and are getting quite busy!"}
{"text":"Service was fast & food arrived quickly. Appetizer #1 egg rolls- they are quite good but dripping in oil. This could be improved without so much oil on them making them soft rather than crunchy.

Main dish #8 Pho. It's not bad- little to salty for me. The pho should be able to hold it's own but it falls rather flat. 

Not sure I will come again- might stick with Saigon Noodle who does have the best pho in town."}
{"text":"We literally woke up one morning over a weekend, read a review on Yelp under the recent activity page, and decided to give it a shot. For people who know me, visiting Saigon every weekend for the spicy beef weekend special is a must, but the bf and I decided we wouldn't be able to stop thinking about Pho Nam until we give it a shot, mainly to see how it compares with Saigon, and then decide which would be our go-to. 

So the usual weekend shopping gang ended up at Pho Nam around 1 pm, still considered lunch time especially for the weekend. But it was sparsely occupied. We were seated immediately. I ordered the spicy pho (#7) and the others at my table had the deluxe pho (#14). The deluxe pho was priced comparably with the large version at Saigon, but there was very little meat here in comparison (Jason I have to agree with you on the meat part). Overall the serving portion here is small. The broth is light but flavorful, so for the flavor-hearted, there are hot sauce and hoisin sauce to help with the taste. 

The spicy version is also pretty distinct. Pho Nam only offered the boneless version, slicing up the beef into pieces for you. It is slightly more expensive than Saigon, but it offers more meat compared to their deluxe pho that my friends had. It was a mix of beef and flank, I very much preferred the flank. Again it looks more spicy than it actually is. 

Being significantly less busy I thought service would be better. It's true that they take your orders fast and the food comes quickly and you get your check promptly. But they did not offer to refill our waters once even though someone's cup was empty, which was a little strange.

Personally I prefer Saigon's flavor. And the fact that you get more food and meat per serving helps seal the deal. I have no problem walking to the counter after my meal and settling the bill there directly. I'm glad we checked out Pho Nam. That puts our hearts at ease =)"}
{"text":"Pho Nam is great.  Good food and good service.  I usually get take out and its ready within 10 min.  I've had the Pho, spring rolls, Bun and even their chicken wings (which I surprisingly some of the best in the area.)"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times. And we have gotten food to go just as often. The food is always great! The venue is very quiet. If you like good food, or if you like quiet restaurants, then Pho Nam is the place for you."}
{"text":"I stopped in around 5 on a Sunday and there was no one there at all, but I ordered the pho, and got my food in minutes. I am not very familiar with pho, but I thought it was delicious. I can only imagine how fantastic this place would be in the winter. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and excellent pho.  I had the shredded chicken pho and my husband had the pork wonton pho.  Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty good vermicelli bowls (bun) and fresh spring rolls. Peanut dipping sauce for the spring rolls was excellent. Main reason for the 3 star review is the prices. Pretty high at $8-10 for a bowl of pho or bun, and spring rolls are. $3.75 for 2. Friendly staff though-- just not a good value."}
{"text":"I'm from California and was in Madison for Business.  Went to this place on Sunday evening and boy the place was so dead.  We thought that with all these great reviews the place would be jam packed but that was not the case.  We decided to stay since we didn't want to drive out any further for a pho restaurant.

My husband and I both order number 14 pho with everything.  The service was fast and when the waitress brought out the veggies out for the pho noodle; the beans sprout seems to be old that they just give it to us since they don't want to \"waste\" it.  

This is one reasons why I gave it a low review and the broth was salty that I had to ask for more limes.  The after taste of the pho was not good as it left me so thirsty.  I will not be going back for any more pho in Madison as I don't think they compare to California pho imo."}
{"text":"Never had Vietnamese food before but the stir fry with rice noodles was really good."}
{"text":"I ordered luxury pho and friend egg roll. Both of them are really good. Next time I will try their fried tofu. My friends told me the fried tofu is good too"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here because I like the authentic Vietnamese and the kind and attentive owner/waitstaff. Try the vegetarian spring rolls and vermicelli bowl during the summer and a nice bowl of pho ga (chicken) on a winter day."}
{"text":"Just went to the grand opening last night. Don't miss the spring rolls. They are delicious. The quality of ingredients is higher here than other vietnamese restaurants around. For my entree I ordered the beef pho with tendon. This is some of the best pho I've had in Madison. Delicate, yet complex broth. Served with basil, lemongrass, and sprouts. Absolutely delicious! Service was good too."}
{"text":"We frequent Pho Nam regularly and enjoy the consistent good service and food. Great for a no-fuss lunch or dinner of noodles or Vietnamese spring rolls; they also serve entrees and dessert as well, including che dau, flan, and a surprising variety of drink options (from fresh coconut to Vietnamese iced tea). Disappointed doesn't cover it when we decide to go and realize it's a Monday -- the one day of the week they're closed!"}
{"text":"This place is pho-nam-inal! My grandmother grew up on Vietnam and makes us pho sometimes. The pho here rivals hers. The prices here are exceptional especially considering the amazing quality of the food. The service is quick and friendly and the atmosphere is calm and relaxing. A perfect place for a date or just an excellent meal. We will most certainly be coming back for more of their traditional Vietnamese and excellent service. Thank you for a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Came into restaurant with moderate expectations  - no music, dimly lit and ...empty. No menu intr=oo from server, no welcome - just seated us and walked away. Two in our party- both had Pho. One chicken, one beef. Broth / stock a real budget version of authentic dishe - it was like scented water with cilantro and glass noodles and the meat could be measured in teaspoons...
I cannot recommend this spot and would not return due to the low quality and flavor less broth...yeah, i get it about the bean sprouts, basil and lime, jalapenos- they were old, dried out and unless one happens to like a red chili sauce squeezed into a flavorless stock, it would be worth it to steer clear of this mediocity. What ARE all you 5 star reviewers eating on days when you are not gushing about the great food here??
BTW - the stock is NOT done with bones / marrow...."}
{"text":"Both of us enjoyed the Spring rolls and Pho. Service was great, prices were very reasonable. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I went to Pho Nam for lunch while in the midst of trying to shake a nasty cold. The idea of a giant bowl of hot, spicy soup really appealed and they did not disappoint. As a vegetarian I was a little weary at first but was relieved to see that they had several veggie options on the menu. 

For starters I ordered the coconut juice. I was expecting to get a glass of ice and a can of coconut juice but was pleasantly surprised with an actual coconut with a straw sticking out of it. Next I had the Udon veggie soup. The vegetables tasted fresh (not frozen) and where slightly underdone, which is how I prefer them. The noodles and the broth were perfect.

I can strongly recommend Pho Nam to anyone looking for something a little different on the westside."}
{"text":"Great food, rich and filling. The pho was savory, flavorful and delicious, the vermicelli was salty and sweet and absolutely wonderful.

Pho Nam had excellent service and very friendly staff as well and for the price, it can't be beat if you've got a craving for Vietnamese noodles."}
{"text":"I have tried them twice, and both were not pleasant. First time I ordered their grilled chicken rice. The dish was flavorless. Had to put a lot of sriracha and soy sauce into the dish. Second time I ordered their deluxe Pho. The meat was not fresh, beef tendon and stripe tasted really weird. The soup and other things were ok.

Service was good. Will not repeat due to low food quality."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! Speedy and polite service. Very helpful waitstaff. We didn't wait long at all! We were going to Outback.... which always has a friggin super long unnecessary long wait.... 45 min+. So we stumbled upon this place and absolutely loved it. Great selection of tastes to light up your senses. You'll enjoy!"}
{"text":"Like this better than Saigon, although this one is a little bit far away from where I live and work, its quiet environment and light traditional music can be an attraction. The price is a bit lower than similar restaurants, maybe it's because its location, while the taste is always as good. I recommend spicy beef noodle soup and noodle soup with beef tender loin. Soup is always good, and the service is good."}
{"text":"I tried their pho and pork chop with rice.  I am quite disappointed.  There was hardly any noodles in the pho, mostly just soup.  The pork chops were flavorless.  Service was horrible.  The was only two tables and we could not find the waitress half the time. I will never come back here again!"}
{"text":"Having visited Vietnam I was craving the great papaya salads I had there. The one I had at Pho Nam was very tasteless. The spring rolls were just mediocre as well. Saigon Noodles has much better food."}
{"text":"Let's start of with a good atmosphere and helpful service when we had a question about the food they will help us witch I found really nice! The food was ok the Wontons were ok! The egg rolls were a little oily but had good flavor! The soups for me lack seasoning and the Stir fry was really oil but the vegetables were nice and fresh!  Overall it was a ok."}
{"text":"I grew up on Vietnamese noodle soups and also had the privilege of growing up near the Twin Cities where Vietnamese restaurants are plentiful. I've been generally disappointed with the Vietnamese food offerings here so was pleasantly surprised when I finished my entire bowl of pho tai with meatballs at Pho Nam and was satisfied. The meat and noodles were well done, and the broth was clean and tasted right. The appetizers were average (we tried the spring rolls and egg rolls). All-in-all, I was happy with the pho, and ultimately, that's all that matters. Whenever I have a hankering for it on those cold, winter days, I know where to go.

The new restaurant is located in a new strip mall out near the suburbs. They do a good job with their space, keeping it clean, simple, and functional. The staff was friendly and really seemed to care about running a good restaurant."}
{"text":"This has become a favorite place to eat out. The pho is by far the best I've found in Madison and I like the flavor differences between their beef pho and the vegetarian pho. The family that runs the place is very friendly and it's partly their service that keeps bringing me back. But mostly, it's the incredible flavors and freshness of the food."}
{"text":"It's the best Pho in Madison, hands down.  I don't really have anything else to say, I go here almost every weekend.  When compared to the big boy Pho joints in Chicago, Seattle, L.A., one will find some nuances missing, but this is Madison and I'm grateful as heck that we have a good Pho joint."}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful family owned restaurant. Delicious, consistent, quality food. Beef vermicelli noodle, combo fried rice, and chicken pho are our favorites."}
{"text":"Very \"pho hum\"--lovely decor, good service, fresh ingredients, but lacking in flavorfulness or spice.  Why not go to a better Vietnamese restaurant just down the road on Odana?  We were hoping this noodle house would offer good competition, since the Odana restaurant is often crowded--but we would rather wait in line, frankly.

Update--Still \"pho- so\"--gave it another chance nearly seven years later and found little had changed.  The atmosphere is still peaceful and pleasant, the service prompt and efficient;  no blaring TV or elevator music like some of its competitors; but food seriously lacks zing of nearby competitor."}
{"text":"Pho Nam is a great place to get some yummy pho.  I've gotten take out from here, and their service is really pleasant and fast! They give a decent amount of veggies, and the broth is really flavorful.  Also I like to ask for extra sauce when I order spring rolls and they were so nice to accommodate.  Great food, great service, will come back again :)"}
{"text":"This is my first experience with pho but it was delicious.  I got vegetarian pho with vegetable spring rolls. The pho was so comforting on a super chilly winter day. I will try the udon vegetable noodles next time to try. Service was crazy fast and pleasant.  Give Pho Nam a try!"}
{"text":"All Pho are beef based except vegetarian. Plus...at 830 on the owner starts to rush and literally kicked us out. They didn't even want to refill our drinks or offer us any dessert. 
Genuinely the worst place I have ever dined at and will not be returning to this place again."}
{"text":"Best pho broth in Madison. I said it. They also are the only place in Madisin to have culantro on the garnish plate. Thumbs up! 

I always get deluxe pho wherever I go; the kind with all the weird jiggly cow bits. Undercooked tendon (read: crunchy) turned me off a bit, but once I got all of it out, I was a very happy camper. We also ordered some pork spring roll-esque appetizers that didn't fare as well. The pork was almost desiccated, bordering on inedible. 

My two complaints certainly warrant another visit and an update. If it were closer to home, I'd definitely go back more often for that amazing broth."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch on a snowy day of running errands. I ordered the pho with beef off of the lunch special menu (though to be honest I did not see a major price differential between the lunch special menu and the regular menu), and it was brought out to me in under 5 minutes! Maybe the items on the lunch menu are ones that are ready-to-go? This quickness might be worrying in some cases, but my noodle soup was perfect! The noodles were at just the right done-ness: soft, yet with a slight chew factor. The beef was really flavorful and savory, and the broth, with onions, scallions, and a squeeze from a lime wedge, had just the right balance and salty and sour/sweetness. YUM. I got a Pepsi, tipped 20%, and it came out to just under $12, which felt just right for such a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"We really like Pho Nam Noodle House. We stick to our favorites, such as Thai Iced Tea, Fresh Spring Rolls, and Pho Noodle Soup. We have noticed that in the last 4 months their broth has been on point. Not sure if they changed anything but it is extremely delicious. We like the simplicity of the menu options. I think the amount of meat in the soup is fair. Besides, the meat is not the highlight of the soup, I believe it is the delicious broth."}
{"text":"I was excited to check out Pho Nam on a lunch break the other day. It's about a ten minute drive from my office so I knew I'd be a bit rushed but had heard that service at lunch time was lightening fast. And man oh man was it! The words \"beef pho\" (#8) barely left my mouth when a steamy bowl of broth and noodles and a plate of sprouts, fresh basil, and lime appeared in front of me. The pho was perfectly seasoned - I only needed to add a squirt each of hoisin and sriracha to add a bit of a kick. Perfection!

In addition to the delicious meal, the prompt service and reasonable prices make this a great lunch option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We use to come here to ordered pho and thought it was really good.  However, today we drove for 8 hr and staying in the hotel near by.  We checked on the website and said they open until 9 pm today.  We went there at 8 pm to place a large take out order.  As soon as I get to the door and the door was close and a Asian woman came and open the door so I told her that I want to order take out.  She said they are closed and I told her it was only 8 pm? She said it was quite today so she sent the cook home.  I was thinking what kind of business are they running.  I went ther 1 hr before closing time not 15 mins to and she has the nerve to close 1hr ealier.  This is totally bullshit if you are going to open a restaurant then commit to the opening and closing time.  This is very rude of them, we won't be returning!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese  food and service. Clean and friendly. We come here more than once in a weekend when we visit Madison. The best pho and egg rolls in town. The papaya salad is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is comparable to pho in Chicago. Broth is rich, but a little salty. Their menu selections are legit, and portions generous. Their vietnamese coffee comes premade in a mug, rather than with the press on top, but it's still pretty good. I would come back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pho and spring rolls! Greeted nicely and always checked to make sure we were taken care of, would recommend and will return."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in the mood for some pho so we decided to try this place out. We came on a Sunday afternoon and the place was dead.

The food came pretty quickly. The broth was salty and it wasn't piping hot like it should be. Overall I wasn't too impressed. There are certainly better pho places in Madison."}
{"text":"The vegetarian pho chay is so darn good I've eaten here 3 times in one week. Generous portions of basil, tofu, and jalapeños. Delish!!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the other items in the menu but the beef pho I ordered hit the spot- bright, spicy, brothy, meaty.
The veggie spring rolls were tasty, fresh and the peanut sauce was great.  
But was really a step ahead was the service.  The food came quickly.  I was brought lime water and they were very attentive.

This might just be my new favorite near work treat.  Ugh.... too much food, sleepy, must limp back to the office."}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in Madison. They have great service and food. They're lunch specials are also great. Everything is priced very reasonably and the food is really authentic. I have experimented with many different things across the menu and have never been disappointed. Their spring rolls are great to start with a delicious peanut sauce. Enjoy your experience here!"}
{"text":"We tried Pho Nam Noodle House for a late lunch Saturday afternoon. We had to park about a block away, but once we reached the restaurant it was bright, airy, and clean. We were greeted at the door and our waitress escorted us to our table and gave us menus. The menu had lots of delicious sounding options at reasonable prices. We ordered the egg rolls, papaya salad, pho, grilled rice plate and lime drink. The egg rolls were perfect;  crispy, crunchy, shells wrapped around a flavorful pork filling. The papaya salad was not what I was expecting. Instead it was strips of green papaya w/slices of shrimp and pork and basil. Served with a delicious vinegar sauce this dish was also really good. My pho was served with a large portion of bean sprouts and basil. The broth didn't have quite the complex undertones I hoped for but it was still very tasty. Some of the beef was a bit gristly. The pork on the grilled plate also contained gristle but the flavors were spot-on.

Overall we really enjoyed the food. The prices were quite reasonable and the service was fine. If we're in the area we would not hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"I'm definitely no expert on Vietnamese cuisine, but I like to consider myself an adventurous eater. I've had good experiences with the sort of \"Asian fusion\" noodle houses that you can find in most cities, and being new to Madison, I wanted to give this little Vietnamese place a try. 

Wow, we were not disappointed. Because it is one of the most traditional Vietnamese dishes, I wanted to try the pho. We could hardly believe our taste buds. The broth was rich and flavorful, and the accoutrements served along with the pho were fresh and tasty. The beef was thinly sliced and pink in the middle. What a treat. We've been back several times since - this is the sort of place that's good enough to cause random cravings. I've been other places to try pho since, and I haven't found anything to compare. Do check this place out!"}
{"text":"Hit the place for lunch almost weekly. Pho Nam says it all."}
{"text":"Best phò I've had in Madison!  I had the Spicy Phò; the noodles were delicious and the broth was aromatic and flavorful. The Vietnamese coffee was a too sweet for me, but otherwise, a very good meal!"}
{"text":"Superb experience tonight at this off-the-beaten track restaurant. The owner greeted us with a very warm smile, obviously grateful that we stopped in. I ordered an egg roll appetizer and beef fillet Pho. The egg rolls came out promptly, piping hot (I love that), crisp and flavorful. The Pho was excellent! Being an extreme spicy flavor guy, I added Sriracha sauce and jalapenos (served on the side). Quiet, relaxing place and immaculate as well. This was our second time here, and it became one of our favorites tonight. As a plus, even with appetizers it was inexpensive. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pho Nam is a fantastic Vietnamese spot!  If you are seeking Vietnamese in Madison, this is your place.  The Pho has an excellent flavor with a typical Vietnamese flavor.  Those of you that seek Pho in the Midwest know the lack of the Vietnamese style in the area.  Their Bun bowls are excellent and again, have the Vietnamese flavors that are so delicious.  I also enjoy their combination fried rice.  It is nothing like your Chinese styled fried rice but that's why it so good!  Their egg rolls and spring rolls are outstanding.  If you need a pick me up, order the Vietnamese iced coffee.  Lastly, they make their iced tea with Jasmine tea and throw in a lime wedge...  outstanding!!!  The owners are fantastic and extremely friendly.  I look forward to returning each time I am in Madison.  I hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went to Pho Nam Noodle House with The Wife for Mother-To-Be's Day. The service was good and the food came out REALLY quickly, but, unfortunately, the food was severely lacking in flavor.

The Vietnamese Spring Rolls (#2) were good, but the sauce's flavor was really weak and what little flavor the sauce did have was overpowered by the spring rolls themselves. If you know me, you know that this is a problem since I LOVE sauce.

The Wife had the Pho with Beef (well-done flank) (#9), which she enjoyed; however, I tried it and was not impressed. The beef was flavorless, so the only flavor in the dish came from the lemongrass broth, which I found boring and \"flat.\"

I ordered the Beef Vermicelli Noodles (#25) which comes with stir fried lemon grass beef topped with peanuts and vegetables. When the dish was placed on the table, I was disappointed to discover that there was almost no beef in it. Seriously, there were maybe eight SMALL strips of beef and that was it. Needless to say, I didn't find the meal satisfying ... My dish also came with a small bowl of sauce on the side, which was lucky because the dish itself had literally NO sauce on it. NONE. After dumping the entire bowl of sauce onto my meal, I was again disappointed to discover that it was totally flavorless. Even The Wife, who enjoys low-flavor foods, was surprised at how absolutely flavorless my meal was. I ended up having to douse the entire dish in hoisin sauce, which the restaurant luckily has on the table, to enjoy it.

I will not return to Pho Nam Noodle House."}
{"text":"Very good food, it just takes some getting used to if you are not used to authentic pho.  I do wish they provided a little bit more meat with their pho."}
{"text":"Our 2nd choice of pho to go to the night we find out the other pho place is closed for a while. We have been here a couple of times and enjoyed our meals, but this time...everything was off. The Vietnamese eggrolls had a dark brown tinge on one side, looking burnt. With closer inspection, I think the filler meat, usually pork, is really the boiled shredded beef from the pho stock doused in some sauce. Really?! Wth is that all about? Cutting corners?! The taste was not even close to other Vietnamese eggrolls I've eaten in the past. The cabbage was soggy and just added a different crunchy consistency to the eggrolls. They were accompanied with a bed of sad iceburg lettuce, the end of an unripe tomato, and a slice of cucumber-the highlight of the dish.
 
The pho broth was decent except there was an unusual spicy heat to it. At first sip, the broth made me hack. Either the broth already had the essence of jalapenos cooked in it or the two slices I put in were extremely potent. We quickly took out slices and found it was too late to avoid the heat. It made the meal experience unpleasant and rushed with each of us needing to down two glasses of water and constantly blowing our  noses. 

It will be a while before we come back."}
{"text":"Actually more like 3.5 stars. Got the pho tai (flank steak). Broth was too salty and one-dimensional, and the meat slices were a little thicker than I would have liked, resulting in a chewy meat. Overall it was just ok."}
{"text":"While on business in the lovely white snow laden city of Madison, where the temp dipped to a lovely naught today...that's zero degrees Fahrenheit...I was craving a warm soup like substance that also had noodles in it...there was no other choice than but to search out some pho. And my God did Pho Nam come through. 

Now when in an Asian persuasion place of gastronomics, one should always get a beer. But please...do not order Kirin or Asahi. These are made in St. Louis. One must get something more...well Asian. Tsingtao? Check. Happiness? Check. 

I started with the minced pork eggrolls. These were crispy on the outside and lovingly chewy on the inside. Seasoned to perfection with an excellent proportion of veg to meat the flavor on these were intense. The dipping sauce was subtle and a little salty. Delicious. Of course, judicious application of their house made hoisin was also appreciated. 4 stars for these tube form crunch monsters. 

The main event. The fillet and meatball pho. I read some reviews where the \"did not have enough meat\". I guess they just caught the place on an off night. Mine had 7-8 pieces of shredded fillet and 5-6 pieces of meatball. Not sure if I was just that cold or what, but it was perfectly temped and did not burn like Hades wild fire in the mouth. The broth was delicious, slightly salty, very savory, and a lovely clearish brown. The veggies in the pho were par soft with just a little crunch. The noodles were outstandingly prepared. Slightly past al-dente vermicelli provided epic slurpage as I made a mess load of noise slurping this stuff down. I put a little extra cilantro, jalapeno, and sprouts in along with a dash of the aforementioned hoisin and just a splash of Sriracha. Spicy, sweety, smoky noms ensued. 

Now...when I say it was damn good, I come from a city where Pho is not taken lightly. And this was on par if not just a little more special considering the temp outside. Warmed me to the core and made the taste buds dance. Yes. 5 stars. 

Service? Brief. But to the point. The food came relatively fast and all the servers had smiles on their face. So well done in this regard as well. 

Did I mention I had Tsingtao beer(s)? There may or may not have been more than one placed on my table. I plead the 5th. 

If you are in Madison, in the winter, with an absence of temperature outside, and need a damn fine noodle fix a la Pho style, you cannot go wrong here. Period."}
{"text":"Having just returned to Wisconsin after eight months in Hanoi, I was eager to try the local Madison Vietnamese Restaurant scene and was happy to find Pho Nam just around the corner.  I've now been their twice and have been very pleased.  

Their pho is very good.  The chicken pho has a tasty broth and generous slices of white breast meat.  The \"extras\", herbs, limes and sprouts, are all fresh and very high quality.  Definite thumbs up on the pho.

We also tried the springrolls and, while tasty enough, they weren't fresh (which is the antithesis of Vietnamese cooking).  They were good sized and full of good, quality ingredients, in spite of being \"pre-made\".

I also tried the my xao which is essentially meat/vegetables served over egg noodles and it was very good, although Pho Nam fried the egg noodles (as opposed to serving them simply steamed as was the case in Hanoi; a regional variation maybe?).  I prefer the later, but wasn't disappointed.

One of my favorite things about Vietnam was the iced coffee there, so I was very happy to see \"ca phe sua da\" on the menu at Pho Nam and it didn't disappoint.  Fresh, Veitnamese coffee served with sweetened condensed milk and served on ice is fantastic and Pho Nam does this very well.

The service was fine if not somewhat inattentive.  The restaurant itself, in a strip mall, is clean and bright.  Prices are decent.  

All in all, I'm happy with Pho Nam and will return again whenever I need a little taste of \"Hanoi\"."}
{"text":"My office is close to Pho Nam so I end up eating here about once or twice a month. I really enjoy the noodle dishes; both the bun and the vegetarian rice noodle dish are excellent. I really like that the vegetables always taste fresh, not like some restaurants that use freezer burned, soggy vegetables.

They offer a good variety of sauces to fine tune the taste of your dish.

The egg rolls are a decadent treat. Some may find them a bit oily, but I enjoy the right out of the fryer taste and aroma. The skin is perfectly crisp.

The service is always very friendly. I'm not sure if it's a family that runs the place, but you get to know the servers and they get to remember you and what you like.

Would recommend if you're on the west side and want something delicious and filling to warm your belly."}
{"text":"Though not as well known (yet), I think Pho Nam is slowly stealing customers away from Saigon. They serve essentially the same dishes, but Pho Nam is ever so slightly cheaper. I have friends telling me the pho here is better than at Saigon, but unfortunately, I can't tell. Take it as it is. In addition, this place has a dessert menu!

However, Pho Nam is a small and cramped restaurant. I foresee issues when their client-base grows. But for now, it's still doable if you go in groups. Another down side is that both Pho Nam and Saigon are closed on Mondays. Come on, Pho Nam! Switch up the off days and win some business!"}
{"text":"good service and great food?rice noodle is just fine, but the spring roll is a must try. Ps. The coconut is very fresh and sweet!"}
{"text":"This place is pho-nam-i-noodle.   ;)   :)

I ordered the hot & spicy rice noodle soup with beef (Bun Bo). I do not have a very high spice tolerance, so it left my lips and tongue tingling. I enjoyed the warmth of the broth and the noodles. 

I also tried some of the Vietnamese Iced Coffee, which was good and strong and just the right about of sweet for my sweet tooth.

My sister ordered beef vermicelli noodle (Bun Bo Xao) that came with sweet and sour sauce made with fish sauce. It was very tasty and refreshing.

My mom ate the combination fried rice (Co'm Chien Xa Xiu, Tom Ga). With a little bit of chili paste for the selection of table sauces, it made for a good dish."}
{"text":"So I went to a pho restaurant and didn't order pho...I had fried rice noodles with seafood. It was very good! It had  a nice flavor and the squid wasn't overcooked and chewy (which is rare). I will definitely be coming back to try the pho."}
{"text":"We've been coming here about 3-4 years now quite regularly. I'm a strict vegetarian so they have great options - all of which I alternate between because they're all so good.

If you want more vegetables in your soup like broccoli, I recommend the tapioca noodle soups. The pho is also quite good with the fixings and sauces you can put in. The tofu appetizer and spring rolls are my favorite and switch between those also. The two noodle dishes in vegetarian(egg noodle and the smaller noodle fried) are great also."}
{"text":"My family has been going here for years. My absolute favorite restaurant in Madison! The pho and noodle bowls are the best! And that's coming from a former Seattleite!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been waiting for this restaurant for a long time since we are huge fans of Viet. noodles. I read the reviews here before I went there myself and I should say reviews on Yelp gave me high expectations. 

First of all, pho was great. we both liked the broth very much. If you are a fan of Saigon noodles on Odana Rd., you would think the portion is smaller than ones at Saigon noodles. 

We ordered two appetizers(egg rolls and spring rolls). I give 3 stars for egg rolls and 4 for spring rolls.

We ordered a combination fried rice for my son but it was not as good as ones at other Asian restaurants. My son is 4 years old and of course he likes fried rice everywhere but he kinda stopped eating at some point. You might like it if you are a big fan of curry flavor.  

The reason why I am giving this restaurant 3 stars in rating is the service. I was very disappointed with the service that my waiter was giving us. I understand his language barrier made everything look worse than it really is but I still think the owner or manager should put someone who could at least communicate with their customers.

It was worth trying and food was good enough. 
I will give another try soon and am hoping they will get better."}
{"text":"Warning: this restaurant heats up dishes in the microwave. 

The restaurant was so extremely quiet that you could hear a pin drop. Breaking up the silence inside Pho Nam were the constant sounds of microwave beeps and microwave doors slamming.

Our food was okay but quite bland. The peanut sauce for our appetizer was great. My fish soup (my main dish) consisted of a whole lot of broth, a whole lot of noodles, a whole lot of green onions and four pieces of chewy fish. 

Not returning."}
{"text":"Yay! A new favorite! I can't comment on the authenticity because I've only had Pho one other time, but I was craving something Asian after eating Thanksgiving leftovers for three days and this hit the spot! 

My fiance had pho with beef and I had the asian noodles with wontons and pork. His had rice noodles and a beefier broth and mine had ramen like noodles and a chicken broth (I think).  They were very different but equally good! 

I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"We are huge fans of pho. I have been eating pho my entire life, so I was pretty excited to find out that a pho place opened so close by! 

The pho was tasty and the portion size was good for the price. The one downside to the pho is that the broth was too thin - it was more watery than it was broth. However, I will be back for the pho. The spring rolls were not freshly made, but there was a lot of shrimp included. 

That being said, we got our food quickly. The service was great. My boyfriend got the coconut drink and asked to have the coconut cut open once he was finished drinking so he could eat the meat, and they gladly did it. We will be back to try more things from the menu."}
{"text":"Tried this for the fist time as I was in the area and saw the positive reviews. Ordered the chicken pho and I wish I could bottle the smell! It was heavenly (and tasted good too). We also ordered the spring rolls and the peanut sauce lived up to the positive reviews. I ordered the food to go and the staff was friendly and my ordered was filled quickly. I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"We ordered 2 pho, 1 with beef, 1 beef & meat ball.  Pretty stingy on their meats, the meatball was cut into thin slices(why call it meatball!?).  Server took our order, brought our food and never saw her again.  We went up to the counter to pay."}
{"text":"We came in on a Tuesday around 8 and the whole place was empty. The pho and bun bo hue were good but just wasn't enough of noodles in either bowl to be filling. But this is a reoccurring theme in most pho restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Favorite place to dine in Madison area. Very delicious and good price. The staff were all very kind. I regret not saying goodbye or the last time before moving to New York, but whenever we went there to eat, they were always happy to see us. There's a big TV so that'll keep you busy hahaha
One of my favorite memories is when we went there on Mother's Day (I didn't even realize that) , and the waiter gave my mom a free drink! It was very good I was told."}
{"text":"Excellent little place! I go to Dragonfly Yoga a few doors down but for some reason never stopped in. I'm sorry it took me so long! My bf was actually in the mood for a burger so we went to a nearby place but left after being seated then ignored. Best thing that could have happened to us on a lazy Sunday afternoon. We wandered into Pho Nam. Even though it was about 2ish, the place was nearly packed. We were seated quickly and waters seem to materialize out of thin air. A nice lady quickly showed up to take our order. We started with the spring rolls and they were outstanding. Love love love that sauce. I think the sauce at Saigon noodles may be slightly better but this was good stuff. The bf had the house special pho which seemed to be one of the more popular menu items. The broth flavor was excellent and the side plate with all the goodies was huge. Everything seemed very fresh. I had the stir fried noodles and even though it could have a used a kick or two up on the spice factor, it was excellent. Plenty of veggies cooked perfectly. Great value too.

Dear Pho Nam: I'm sorry it took me so long to come try you. I'll be back soon :)"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Asian stir fry noodles, and Pho Nam is in the top 3 for me in the Madison area (along with Ha Long Bay and Monsoon Siam). I have eaten the seafood with rice noodles at Pho Nam three times, and I keep going back. The dish is loaded with fresh veggies and seafood. Many restaurants give you mostly noodles. Pho Nam is generous with veggies and seafood, with a good balance of noodles.

Many restaurants overcook their seafood, such as squid, octopus and scallops. Pho Nam prepares these perfectly, cooked for a very short time to keep delicate seafood soft and juicy.

The flavors are fantastic. My one request? More vegetarian options. It would be great if the lunch specials were offered with tofu or something. The only vegetarian lunch special is veggie pho (and noodles with broth are not my favorite). There are a lot of vegetarians in Middleton, some working at Epic. I don't work there, myself, but I have friends that do, and there are many people who do not eat pork (shocking, I know, to many--you know who you are)."}
{"text":"This place is great! Attentive service, fast and cheap, and great food. I favor veggie dishes and suggest mixed vegetables with tofu, vegeterian summer rolls, and vegetable pho. Also works well as a to-go meal."}
{"text":"The one time I ate here it was absolutely disgusting. They used a microwave to cook our appetizer which was rubbery. The actual meal was flavorless. I had an upset stomach for the rest of the night. If your at this place just walk next store to Brew Brothers or the Mongolian grill. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Tasty but even though the waitress asked how our pho was, and I told her it needed more meat, all she did was say,\"I'll tell the chef.\" Nothing happened, and seriously, it only had 6 pieces of beef in it. Also, misspellings on the menu..."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly busy on a Sunday night out in this suburban location...I think the number of visitors was unexpected, as our waiter wasn't a real waiter...he was a relative of the family just helping out in the rush. But, he was great! Talkative, and helpful, sharing the 'right' way to eat Pho (or maybe at least, his way to eat it). 
Nevertheless, about the food: 
We started with wontons. Filling was good, but you had to get through the overly-deep fried wontons to taste it. I will get the veggie egg rolls next time. 

I had Chicken Pho, excellent portion, good flavor, super-filling, and would definitely order again.

Husband had a grilled chicken and rice dish that he ate every bit of, along with a considerable amount of the spicy red sauce on the table. 

Hands down the cheapest dinner I've had in a long time. Would have been $19 for 2 sodas, app, and 2 entrees if they charged us for the appetizer. But they didn't, so the bill was only $15 before tip! Amazing value.

Promotion is a free appetizer, but unsure of how long it's running."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The seafood noodle soup is out of this world. The broth is so flavorful with a  delicious garlic aroma. Seriously, it's amazing. The chicken pho is really good too. I love the portion size and the price. It's excellent."}
{"text":"We were driving through Madison on our way home to Minnesota after Thanksgiving in Illinois and attempted to stop for a light lunch at Salad Creations next door. Lucky for us, they were closed for the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and we got to to try Pho Nam instead. We ordered the Vietnamese Spring Rolls, Pho with beef meatballs, Egg Noodle & Wonton Soup with BBQ beef and the Hot & Spicy noodle soup.  Service was fast and friendly and the soups were flavorful and delicious. The spring rolls were pretty typical but delicious as well. Obviously freshly prepared and authentic foods. Our 9 year old loved the Pho, especially the generous plate of bean sprouts that came with it. We will definitely make a detour to stop here again."}
{"text":"This is my second time here, and the Pho is good, and it was under $20 for two of us to have huge bowls of pho.  It was really clean, well lit, and the service was very quick.  In and out within 35 minutes."}
{"text":"Very cheap and very traditional. I never have eaten inside because I get the food to go. Always good and fresh. I'm a big fan of Vietnamese soup, so I love the fact the soups are always large. Some other places in town have a difference in size, but here you get a good portion every time. Staff is always friendly when I call/pickup."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm Excellent meal. 
I am no expert on vietnamese food, but this was mighty tasty. The atmosphere is not high end, but it doesn't need to be.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We checked this place out due to the good reviews we read on Yelp.
We were not disappointed.  Pho Nam was actually better than I expected.
It is a really nice really clean place.
We were greeted right away with a very friendly smile that made us feel like they were really glad to see us and we were there at an off time for a late lunch.  
The restaurant is nicely decorated.  The menu is simple and straight forward which we love.  So easy to decide on what to get.  The waitress was helpful with our selections and the food arrived in perfect time.
Everything was very fresh and had good flavor.  The Hoisin sauce is the best I have ever had.  It was so very good.
The music was very nice and set at what we would call a perfect volume level so that we can hear the music and also our conversation and the interesting conversations nearby, hehe.  
The bathrooms are spotless and decorated nicely.  They need a place to hang your coat in the bathroom.
It was such a wonderful experience we went back for supper and had the Bun Thit Nuong, Cha Glo and the Mi Hay Hu Tiu Xao Do Bien.  (26b and 32)  Rice vermicelli with pork and shrimp and stir fried noodles with seafood.  The noodles with seafood was the best.
I missed it the first time I went by.  It is on your right as you travel south on Junction.  Go past and pull around back into the private lot.

Update.  I have to lower this rating a bit because I recently stopped by here and my dish was not made well.  I ordered the Grilled Pork and Grilled Shrimp Vermicelli Noodle just to try something different.   The vegetables have always been fresh here so all was good but my shrimp was way overcooked and dry and the pork as well was also overcooked.   Needless to say, I won't be ordering this again.   I will stick with the pho.   Darn, I really wanted this place to do well on all the food and this was a real let down."}
{"text":"Best pho broth ever!  Very authentic.  Pho broth is suppose to be understated with rich depth of flavor."}
{"text":"We started coming here years ago when they first opened, and we are regulars. The food is consistently yummy. This past summer, I found out that the family who owns it is related to one of my college buddies! I was happy to report to her that we eat here all the time. :)

We aren't pho fans in general, so we tend to stick to the other style Asian soups, stir fries and Bun (rice noodles). We've never been disappointed. Both the egg rolls and spring rolls are delish as well. And try to save room for the Vietnamese flan! The hubby's fav meal is the wonton soup with ramen noodles - also has char sui (Chinese BBQ pork) in it. I've tend toward either the seafood soup or the veggie soup - I always ask them to substitute the egg noodles for the rice noodles, and to bring me the platter of pho accompanied yummies (bean sprouts, jalapenos, culantro, Thai basil, limes), They always accommodate my needy requests, and no extra charge. Food arrives incredibly fast, and the staff is really nice - especially the owner (disclaimer: we had this opinion before we found out he is my friend's uncle!). Love the fresh lime in the glasses of water, and the hot tea is really good as well.

Really nice that they have a vegetarian section of the menu, which makes it easy to order (and there are tons of options in this section!). Also great that they list the ingredients on the hoisin, Sriacha and chili sauces that are at the table.

We never leave hungry, that's for sure! Have your couch ready for you when you get home."}
{"text":"I had a business meeting on the west side of Madison. There were several choices for lunch before my meeting, but once I saw a Vietnamese restaurant, the decision was made.

I started out with the Vietnamese salad with green papaya, shrimp and pork. Textures were soft and crunchy. Flavors were sweet, salty and a little spicy. All around this was a great tasting salad.

Next was the Deluxe Pho with sliced beef, meatballs, flank, tripe and tendon. If you're going to eat pho, this is how you do it. You get all of the meats, even the scary sounding ones.

The broth was lighter in color than I expected, but I confirmed it was a beef broth. The flavor of the broth was good, but not the best I've had. I still had to add hoisin and chili sauce to match what I was looking for. The noodles were cooked perfectly! 

The standard fixings of lime wedges, basil, culantro, bean sprouts, and jalapenos arrived on a side plate.

The bowl was very large and a great value at $8.95. I would recommend this restaurant to others. I'm not sure what the competition for Vietnamese is like in Madison, but I hope to find out on a future visit."}
{"text":"Really good Vietnamese food with great service. Have eaten here a few times. Spring rolls with peanut sauce are very good. Have also got the pho and bun Bo hue.
Gives you just enough greens!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and it was fabulous! Egg & spring rolls were on point and the pho was delicious. Definately will be back!!!"}
{"text":"There are better choices in Madison.  Specifically the one on Odana."}
{"text":"Pho-nominal!!! (okay, I had to do it)

The pho is so good! It's amazing how a few simple but good ingredients can make a great meal! I have stopped in twice, the first time having the sliced medium rare beef, and the second a mix of the beef and meatball. The broth is clear and delicious. This is just a fresh, tasty meal. I wasn't a big fan of the meatballs in the pho, though. They had a funny consistency, which I later realized reminded me of hot dogs. Not the greatest. They did add chili sauce at the table(which was a good accompaniment) as Yelper Stina had requested. 

The space is as good as a \"strip mall\" location could be. Less than cozy, but clean and bright."}
{"text":"I've never been so happy to live so close to Pho Nam. I stopped by the restaurant to get some pho to go. I've gotten to-go twice here, and the service is phenomenal. I can guarantee that you'll have your pho, ready to eat, in less than ten minutes. The broth has deep and spicy flavors that make you dig for more; for the prices you pay, it's worth the visit and more.

One of the best experiences I have had with carry out has been with pho Nam. A few weeks ago, I called on a Sunday around half an hour before closing time. I asked for two bowls of pho and two spring rolls for carry out, and I told them that if it was inconvenient, I would order food another time. The man I was speaking to was so kind and so accommodating, and he said that my order wasn't a problem at all. Made me feel so welcome, and I appreciated the food all the more.

I believe I was serviced by the same kind man again today when I ordered my pho. He is just the nicest man with a kind smile, and I feel welcome when he took my order. I couldn't wait to come back.

Amazing food, great location, great service, best take out, and still some of the best spring rolls I've had. I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"Great food, and employees are very friendly! I have been here multiple times, and the service is always great."}
{"text":"I used to think there was only one place in Madison to get Pho... Well this may be it.   Wow.  It was amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent service, I routinely order to-go from here as it's close to work. They recognize you by your voice the majority of the time, and I have never had a bad order from here. Personal favorite is the #34 fried rice with pork and shrimp. Even though it's known for it's traditional pho, the fried rice options are just as good."}
{"text":"loved.  great, fresh ingredients in the pho with enormous servings.  really friendly staff.  clean place.  decor is a little uncomfortable but not bad.  minus one star because our waiter was about 14 years old and while totally sweet, he was a little slow for a saturday afternoon where there were only two other tables with customers.  

i felt like i was eating in someone's house but that might be because we were so close to the kitchen we could see the cans of mountain dew they opened and poured into glasses.  the sriracha on the table was dirty - i mean, small stuff.  the food was totally decent.  would go again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Receive our food quickly and it is always delicious. Portion size is plenty- always take 1/2 home for a second meal. Staff is always very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I can't claim to \"know Pho\", but i love the food here..."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Quick coming out with food and cheap too. Got the spring rolls and the egg noodle soup with roast pork and dumplings. Pork was lean and delicious. Would recommend to anyone, looking to go back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Bun Bo is the best I've ever had anywhere!  Pho Tai is tasty, and vermicelli and beef bowl is my other favorite."}
{"text":"I drive by this place pretty frequently but I've always been a loyal Saigon fan. Up until this weekend, my friends and I decided to branch out and try Pho Na, as it was a lot closer to my place. 

I'm a huge pho aficionado, as I do occasionally make pho broth at home myself too. What I like about the pho here, is that the broth has a tinge of sweetness to it, which goes really well with the fresh thai basil and lots of green onions floating in the bowl. My friends and I had the fresh spring rolls to start, and we all agreed that the peanut dipping sauce here was more flavorful and more balanced than Saigon's hoisin peanut dipping sauce. My boyfriend ordered the fried wontons, and the portion size was very generous. I liked the wontons too, as the filling was a lot more flavorful than say, crab rangoon. It was stuffed with a ground meat and vegetable mixture, and the wonton was not too oily. 

I did remove a star, because I felt like my pho did not have enough meat in it. One of my friends also agreed, and we only counted out three little slivers of meat and about one and a half beef balls each (I ordered the combo pho and he had the sliced beef and meatballs). However, the other two people in our party said that they had plenty of meat in theirs. Maybe this was a fluke, and they didn't split up the meat proportionally, but still, I expected more meat in ours. 

All in all, I do like this place, and as winter's approaching, I definitely will frequent this place more for their hot, steaming bowls of pho!"}
{"text":"Fast and courteous service, and cheap food? Pho Nam-enal! Small restaurant but it provides plenty of room for people to sit comfortably. When we entered, the place was empty, but it was 4 in the afternoon on a Friday. The hostess showed us a nice seat and gave us time during which we ordered pho. She literally walked into the back towards the kitchen and came back with two bowls of pho. It was really damn fast. The pho was very hearty plain and came with culantro, which isn't as common as you'd think. The waitress met all our accommodations which included more water and chili garlic oil, but unfortunately, they didn't have peanut butter for us. The portion size was the only problem we seemed to have with the food there. For our American sized appetites, our noodles were probably half the amount we were used to. I think for the amount we paid, we would expect as much food as Ha Long Bay gives out. I might be back cause the pho was worth the drive to the west side, but I'll be ordering extra noodles."}
{"text":"Pho Nam must be short for pho-nam-men-nal! Oh no she didn't! Oh yes I did!  I was here for lunch today and it was so good!  Though my visit was around lunch time this place was pretty empty which I would generally take as a bad sign but the glowing reviews this place has let me know that I should not judge a book by its cover. 

The restaurant is large, clean, and bright; it's sometimes hard to get all three of these things with a restaurant.  The hostess was pleasant as well.  She was very attentive and sweet.  

I ordered the combination fried rice and my guest the spring roll and a noodle dish.  We both really enjoyed our dishes. I asked for my rice to have an extra bit of kick to it and I was not dissapointed. The portions at this place are also really large.  I pretty much stuffed my face and looked down and realized that I had barely made a dent in my lunch.  You know what I call that?  Lunch for tomorrow! Hey!

Yes, I love this place and I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Pho Nam opened less than a week ago, but I'd say they're off to a phenomenal start! Puns aside, I'm a huge pho fan and have been a little disappointed with Madison's offerings in the Vietnamese arena. Enter Pho Nam's delicious, fragrant, and very comforting pho noodle soup ($6.75) that I had this afternoon--my new fave! The broth was complex, the noodles extra thin, and the beef came medium rare and very tender.

The restaurant space, located in the same complex as Hu Hot Mongolian Grill, is bright and calming with many windows and high ceilings, allowing for a lot of natural light. This is key to me, and I find that Saigon Noodles and Ha Long Bay both fail in this ambiance department. If it's a lazy weekend afternoon, if I had one too many drinks the night before, I need a clean and welcoming space in which to recover with my restorative pho.

The best part of our first visit? Free appetizers! During their first month of opening, Pho Nam is giving away one free appetizer with each order. So for the two of us dining, we received two appetizers! The fresh spring rolls ($3.25) are amazing, but I wouldn't recommend the \"Bread Deep Fried Special\" ($4.75). I don't know what we were thinking when we ordered it (should have just gone with the egg rolls!) but it was basically very greasy toast squares with a ground pork/pea pod/egg/onion topping. Next time, I think I'll try the green papaya salad instead. I also want to try their Wonton Soup ($4.75) and their Grilled Pork Vermicelli Noodle dish ($7.25).

On our way out the door, the owner asked us how everything was and inquired if we had any advice, since they were just opening. I mentioned that we'd love to see some spicy chili sauce as a condiment on the tables. But I forgot to also request cream puffs on the dessert menu! Oh well, there's always next time."}
{"text":"This is definitely the most authentic Vietnamese food that I have had in Madison.  The beef pho was perfectly prepared and really hit the spot on a cold Wisconsin night.  The service was great too.  I will definitely come back here again soon."}
{"text":"I have not had good pho here in Madison so this was a nice surprise. A little lighter in flavor than my favorite non WI joints, but still tasty."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of months ago. Upon arrival, we were seated at a table by the window looking out on Junction road. I ordered the noodles and a Pepsi. They were both fantastic. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"For a new business to open in a suburan area, this place was quite busy. 
The reataurant was in a \"L\" shape format, which I thought was quite different from other Asian restaurant I have been to.  The menu was easy to look at.  I was amazed by the quality of paper that it was printed on and to add on, there were even picture of some dishes on the same page where the number was and description of it..  In my opinion, it made it pretty easy for people to know the name of it. 
The food:  Spring roll, ( I love spring roll and I always ordered it whenever I go to a Vietnamese Restaurant) It doesn't have that much noodle but enough for you to enjoy it.  I don't really like a lot of noodle in my spring roll anyways so I was happy about it.  There were more veggies than noddle which is a plus... To add on, there was mint leave in it... a plus again.  The sauce for the spring roll was also amazing too.  It wasn't too thick or liquidy, but perfect to taste it...Chicken wings was good... The Fried wonton was good... there were enough suffing to take it...The only thing I'm not sure if there was any sauce that goes with it... Other than that it was amazing without it.  THE PHO:  Without adding additional sauce besides the greens, it was good already.  By far, It was the best pho I had in Madison.  
Price:  The prices were reasonable.
Good for group:  I would say yes and no... Yes if you make resevation already...or you are just lucky to go there... There is a space by the registered that is big enough for a group of people.
Service:  Service was good... if they forget something, they will make sure to go  back and get it done quickly."}
{"text":"Absolutely dead on tues evening at 7pm. Lightning fast service. The pho is dece but it did not blow my mind. I've had lots of pho and this is average."}
{"text":"This is the first Vietnamese restaurant I try here in Madison, and I thought it was good. The broth was good, but the ration of meat and chicken was very small compared to the size of the bowl. We also ordered the fried wontons and they were definitely a first for me. I have had wontons but not fried in breading. However, I did enjoy them and they were accompanied with a peanut sauce. The staff was great and super friendly. Our waiter even gave us tips about the sauces that you can add into your pho. The establishment is pretty clean as well. Prices super affordable, we where there for lunch and for one chicken pho, one beef pho, and the wontons it was $20."}
{"text":"Best Pho in town! Everything always tastes very fresh and iv always had great and quick service there."}
{"text":"The service was ok and the food was so-so. I went to this place bc a reviewer for Loung Prabada reviewed it to be better. The pho broth is missing the bone flavor. I'm sure they did nit gave bones cooked with the broth. The meat was chewy and low quality. They also did not use pho noodles. I skipped most of the meat and sipped just the so-so broth. It's a Chinese version of Pho!"}
{"text":"Pho Nam Noodle House has my favorite pho in Madison! The food here always seems very fresh and the portions are large. We got spring rolls and BBQ meatballs for appetizers; both were excellent. The pho comes with a large side dish of fresh bean sprouts, jalapeño slices, and basil. 5/5, would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here to eat with my SO on a rainy afternoon after waiting at Saigon for almost half an hour with other people in front of us. That place also has good pho but can get really packed! When we walked in, there were about 7 customers including us. Service was prompt, courteous, and quick. Their pho was awesome and the spicy wings we ordered were nothing short of excellent. I honestly think it's one of the best wings I've had. It wasn't breaded or overly flavored or anything like that... just deep fried and tossed in spicy sauce. Overall, a great experience and will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"The best cure after a night of drinking is a big bowl of pho. 

My friends and I called into the usual places around Madison and no one answered so we presumed they were busy so we decided to give this spot in Middleton a chance. 

We arrived to Pho Nam and was greeted and seated immediately for as the restaurant was empty. My friends ordered pho and I ordered the Bun Bo Hue aka the spicy beef. 

The food came quickly with fresh garnish on side, my spicy beef smelled so wonderful and tasted even better! They also gave me a big portion too, I was going way too full. 

I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Great service amazing food! Me & my boyfriend tried this place it's now our favorite place to go! Beyond delicious!"}
{"text":"I wasn't very satisfied with the Pho at Saigon Noodles and checked out this place with my gf. We were both very pleased with the Pho here. So far, this is the best Pho I've had in Madison, and I will definitely be coming back again. I however, don't recommend the egg rolls."}
{"text":"I ordered the #34. My chicken was poorly cooked and rubbery, vegetables were overcooked and wet, noodles were hard, and overall the dish was extremely salty. Generally bad. The egg rolls were ok. Our food came out quickly, but service was otherwise lacking. Atmosphere was also pretty sparse. I'm not quite sure where all the great reviews are coming from, but I would not recommend Pho Nam."}
{"text":"Best PHO!!!  Took my mom and sister here when they were visiting Madison and they loved it!  My mom had never had Pho before and it was a great experience for her.  The place was very clean, and the service was great.  The best part is the big selection!  The cold coffee was great.  I will be back soon!!

Since our visit, we have tried PHO restaurants in Green Bay and Appleton and neither place could compare to Pho Nam Noodle House in Madison!  Pho Nam ROCKS!!"}
{"text":"So excited to have found Pho Nam before heading into the dark, cold winter.

Dined with friends (party of 3) around 6:30 on a Friday night. Parking was a little sparse (crowded lot shared with other businesses), but there was no wait for a table, and we had appetizers within five minutes of sitting down.

Ordered two kinds of spring rolls, egg rolls, and pho. Everything was delicious, but the pho was definitely highlight. The broth was flavorful, meat tender, and accompaniments plentiful.

I'll definitely enjoy Pho Nam again."}
{"text":"I had Stirfried Egg Noodles with Chicken which was good, the chicken was well flavored, but the noodles and vegetables weren't as flavorful.  The Veggie Egg Rolls were really good! My sister had the Pho with Meatballs.  It was good, very authentic and had enough extra ingredients to put in(basil, sprouts, lime and pepper). 

Nice environment! Friendly Staff!"}
{"text":"While a fan of most any Asian food, and especially noodles, I'd actually never had Pho before last Friday when I stopped in with a friend for a late lunch. I'd heard rave reviews from a few friends and decided to give it a try. I am so glad I did! How could I have missed this place until now?

I'd be surprised by the \"bland\" comments if I didn't know that the average person generally eats food that is overloaded with salt. I ordered the egg noodle wanton soup with roast pork slices. I found the broth to be a little salty, but with roast garlic and some green onions it was definitely enjoyable. I added a dash of Hoisin sauce for a bit of sweet flavor, and found it balanced the overall flavor well. I was also pleased that the dish was heavier on noodles than the wantons or pork slices - I prefer to eat less meat-centric dishes and I found the amount of everything to be perfect for me.

Both of our dishes were served piping hot, so we sipped the broth to start with. Mmm. My pork was sliced thin and was tender without any large fatty bits. The wantons were quite tasty, but I am a sucker for dumplings of almost any kind. Same with the tasty and sweet Thai iced tea, which I couldn't resist ordering. I found myself completely satisfied with leftovers for later. Same for my friend, who was also pleased with the vegetarian options on the menu.

Service was just fine; our orders were taken right away and we had our food in no time. The hostess/waitress was very friendly and checked in with us here and there, but not too much since we had all we needed. I don't mind that the music was quiet and the space somewhat sparse - ambiance really doesn't matter to me when the food is good. The prices were great. We'll definitely be back. In fact, only three days later and I'm seriously craving more!"}
{"text":"Just okay. We went at 6:30pm on a Friday night, and we were the only people at the restaurant. Probably because everyone else who wanted pho went to Saigon Noodle. I wish I had too. At least the service was good. Pho Nam has okay pho, but the broth is a little too salty, and the sprouts and basil leaves on the garnish plate were not fresh. Definitely go to Saigon Noodle instead."}
{"text":"As Pho goes, this place is the real deal.  From broth being made from marrow to the sauces that accompany each dish, this place has Lao written all over it. 

A hidden gem west of town, do not be dissuaded by its appearance from affar.  Spring rolls with tasty chunky peanut sauce & traditional Pho will more than satisfy your craving."}
{"text":"Earlier this week, my acupuncurist recommended that I pick up the vegetarian udon noodle soup from Pho Nam to help in fighting a cold. I thought it was an odd prescription, but since I really wasn't up for cooking, I decided to give her suggestion a whirl. One whiff of that huge bowl of steaming soup convinced me that she was right. It is truly soul warming...Just what the doctor ordered, if you will.

My first visit to Pho Nam was five days ago. I've now been a  total of 3 times. At the moment, I am hung up on (some might use the terminology \"obsessed with\") the soups, so I can't comment beyond that. But do I really need to?  

I've had speedy and pleasant service with each visit. The atmosphere is cozy and clean, but light on customers. It's unsettling to me to see such a great place not have a busier dining room. In fact, that's precisely the reason I signed up to yelp today and wrote my first ever review about Pho Nam. Get over there and patron this fantastic little (locally owned) Madison gem!"}
{"text":"As far as pho goes, this place is just mediocre. However, it definitely fulfilled my pho craving and I'll definitely be coming back. I ordered the Pho Tai (only one size) and it came with the standard vegetable plate. Sriracha and hoisin sauce were available. 
The restaurant itself is nicely furnished and very clean. The servers were friendly and quick. My pho came out within five minutes."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a companion.  First of all, I have to say that their prices are very reasonable.  Pho with sliced beef is only $7.  The pho is the star of the menu. It comes with all the fixings on the side (bean sprout, mint, peppers).  There's also a little guide on the table of how to eat it if you've never eaten pho before.  My companion also had had a noddle dish (cold rice noodles with vinegar hot sauce and pork), which was good, but not as good as the pho.  Also young coconut beverage is available. Only complaint here is the service.  After dropping off the check, the server mysteriously disappeared into the back.  We had to flag down the busboy to give us a takeout container and process the credit card."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a sit down dining experience that's quick and delicious, this is the place for you. 

I've been eating Vietnamese food for most of my life and had plenty of sampling opportunities, so my expectations are pretty high. Staff at Pho Nam are always super welcoming and friendly. The service is always top notch and servers are very attentive. 

This is my favorite place to grab a comforting bowl of pho in Madison, especially during the super cold winters. All soups come paired with fresh basil, lime leaves, bean sprouts, lime, and jalapeño."}
{"text":"Love this place. Their portions are definitely bigger than Saigon's for sure. My favorite dish is the #32 grilled beef. I get it every time."}
{"text":"Pho Nam has a decent offering of Vietnamese style noodle soups, rice dishes and more. Although, I usually get a pho dish without green onions, scallions or cilantro (other commonly known as \"veggies\"), while my boyfriend prefer rice dishes instead since he's not a big pho fan. In essence, there's a little bit of everything to please everyone. 

The broth in the pho is light and refreshing, and the noodles and beef blend well together. Personally, the meat portion in the pho is enough for me, but even I did notice that the amount of meat is definitely on the lower end (so if you're super hungry, might want to ask for an extra order of meat and/or noodles). 

Additionally, we almost always get the tofu appetizer which is surprisedly delicious but it has toppings on top and usually come out extra hot (so be careful while eating and definitely lightly blow on it to cool it down). It may also be an acquired taste for the toppings, so forewarning if you're not a fan of the tofu appetizer (it might just not be for everyone). 

The Thai iced tea I got was on the sweeter side, and had more coconut milk than I would've liked, but it was still deliciously sweet even though I didn't finish the whole drink. I like that they provided it in a take our container in case I wanted to take it to go with me, but since we biked over, I didn't want to take the remainder with me. 

Overall, definitely check out the this tranquil and relaxing pho place. It's definitely less busy during the times we've visited, so our food always comes out quickly, and usually others speak lightly when eating, so it's a calmer atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was coming from out of town in need of an authentic bowl of pho and it was a big dissatisfaction. Pho was super sweet and salty. Got #14 with everything and portion size was small and did not come with everything that was listed. Meat was not fresh. If you are looking to taste a true authentic pho, this not the place."}
{"text":"Pho-I ordered deluxe combination bowl. Before I begin though I have to be upfront about having been spoiled with a mom who cooks very well. I enjoyed the aroma at this location but the taste of the broth is sweeter than the traditional pho. I am impressed though with the herbs/veggies on the side which were true to the real deal.

Chicken wings- perfectly crispy without being too salty or heavily spiced. 

The older gentleman host/owner was pleasant and I enjoyed the peaceful environment away from bar/noisy TV scenes. 
Come when you want hot soups and fresh good-for-you food"}
{"text":"Well the noodle is good, I guess the only issue for me is the size. I need to order two if I would like to be full.."}
{"text":"YAAAAAAS! I am addicted. To the #29 on the menu. Noodles with sliced pork and shrimp. bean sprouts and veggies, a sliced egg roll and some wonderful sauce with carrot slivers floating in it. It is so damn good. The egg roll gets soaked in the sauce but it's still crispy. I always save it for last. Sometimes the shrimp is a little overcooked or the pork is a little drier than I'd like, but it's still really amazing.

Be forewarned, if you come here at lunch, it may take you longer than you expected. Almost an hour and a half for me one day. That doesn't affect my recommendation for you to eat here, though. Do it."}
{"text":"I so want to give a 5 but the service knocked it down. The food gets a 5. I had the stir fry with rice noodles and beef. The noodles were amazing. My husband had the spicy pho. I tried it and it was a bit spicy for me but the flavor was amazing. We shared the vegetarian spring rolls and the dipping sauce is making my mouth water days later. We were one of 2 tables when we arrived during weekday lunch and it filled up but nothing too busy or crazy. That said, I'm not sure why my waitress was hard to find. We never got water refills and had to ask someone else. Then she dropped off the bill and took off before offering my husband a to go container. We waited and she never showed so we had to ask a different waiter. Even with the less than perfect service I will return. I would come back if the wait staff was rude and I had to fill my water myself because the food was that good."}
{"text":"I'm glad we decided to go to Pho Nam. We thought they missed out on a great name opportunity - \"PhoNam-enol Noodle House\", but that's besides the point.

I got the Pho Dac Biet, of course. I wasn't too thrilled with the tripe and the tendon that came with it. The broth and the rest of the beef was really good though.

We ordered the spring rolls to start. They were pretty standard but still delicious.

Service was pretty quick and staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the 1st time a few nights ago.  It was great but just lacked a few things.  I had the beef Pho and it was good but there was not much meat.  They need to be a little more generous with the meat because the flavor was great.  Also, I realized after I ordered that the waiter didn't ask me if I wanted anything to drink.  Luckily, I really only wanted water anyway but that should have been the 1st thing he asked me.  Other than that, the Pho was good as were the spring rolls I ordered.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"After being a regular customer for the last year, I've finally gotten around to reviewing  Pho Nam. Small, family owned restaurant, they've always provided delicious Vietnamese food and great service. We frequent this restaurant for Sunday lunch, particularly in the winters and our orders usually consist of pho with rare beef and vermicelli with pork."}
{"text":"Yes, I know it is a Pho place, but every time I come here, I get stuck on ordering #32.  Great pork plate!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place, fantastic owners and employees! I went here for my birthday for a quick lunch before work and had an amazing experience.

I started with the Korean BBQ Meatballs and had the meatball Pho. The BBQ Meatballs were flavorful and the sauce was good enough to eat the vegetable garnish with! The Pho is always Pho-nominal. 

Since going vegetarian I miss this place immensely, but I tried their vegetable Pho and found the tofu and mushrooms very tasteful and well cooked."}
{"text":"Decent tasting pho, but one size bowl and a lot of broth.  Very little sprouts, lemongrass, etc. 

I would only return if I were close by and was jonesing for pho."}
{"text":"It is a rare occasion that lunch for us actually happens at lunchtime, and we were dressed up anyway, so we strayed from our budget to splurge on something trendy... Pho. Nothing fast about that food, ate as fast as we could and still left most of the broth behind. Also, you have to concentrate so hard on not splashing slurps of noodles all over that you cant have much of a conversation. That said, its freaking delicious. I suppose it might be good for you if you didn't actually care what your date did with their day. Happy Pho!"}
{"text":"I had such a good experience here. I got the vegetarian egg roll and vegetarian pho with jasmine tea. It was so good! Full of veggies like I wanted! The service was really nice and they modified the meals for me, no problem. The owners are very kind. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"PNNH makes the grade. I've been here twice and tried both of my standard dishes: Pho and Bun (Rice noodles) with roasted pork and veggies. The Pho hit the spot, better than the last \"best\" place. PNNH wins there. Beefy, good amounts of noodles. Excellent!

The Bun bowl arrived and the noodles were warm! At first I was surprised. All Bun bowls I've ever had on the West Coast were cold. Kind of a rice noodle salad, etc. But these were warm and, after a few bites let's just say I warmed up to the idea.

PNNH is a bit of a drive but it's my new spot when I know what I'm lookin' pho."}
