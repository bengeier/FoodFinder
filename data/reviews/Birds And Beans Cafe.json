{"text":"I love this place, because their coffee is the best from all the other coffee places in the area. Rich and fair trade. I love their cappuccino !!  I like the vibe of the place. Don't mind the service. Some may get offended cause the workers don't smile constantly at your face \"pretending\" but taking orders and preparing the coffee with skill. I find it real."}
{"text":"Given the rest of the approach at Birds and Beans--sustainability, fair trade, and how they walk the walk in those regards, all of which I respect and get behind, I had reluctantly given Birds and Beans a three-star rating  and lukewarm review, because the service had been somewhat desultory and unpleasant on my previous visits. 

At the time, I mentioned that I would go back to see if things had changed since my last visit, which was maybe a year or so ago--when I had been sufficiently put off that I was loath to return. 

Admittedly it's only one visit, but today when I went in for a coffee and to do some work (away from the many distractions at home), everyone was friendly, brisk, efficient and all those good things. I had a lovely afternoon, sipping a tasty Americano in the back room, looking out on the snowy landscape outside. The people working there were chatty with their regular customers and there was a great neighborhood vibe to the place, and so I'm really happy to post an update that is unambiguously positive! Recommended for a coffee, fabulous cookies and general yumminess!"}
{"text":"The coffee is excellent, but the coldness and attitude from the staff make it a bit less easy to swallow..."}
{"text":"Yay for places like Birds and Beans!  Everything about this place makes me want to come back again and again (except that it's waaay out of my neighbourhood).  This is a cozy cafe at a convenient location, filled with worn wooden tables and seats, relaxed and friendly staff and patrons.  There is some lovely jazz on weekends, too. 

I ordered a soy latte and it was just as good as my other favourite places for latte and for the same cost.  The staff even added some complimentary sprinkles of cinnamon and chocolate on top!  I would have ordered some scones or cookies if they were allergen/gluten free. 

The highlights of this cafe include the cozy, chill ambiance and excellent fair trade coffee products.  I'm an ecologist so I loved that, for once, birds get some badly needed attention! I found the eco-conscious information was there for those who were interested, quite informative but not in an obnoxious sense.  

Mimico residents are quite lucky to have this thoughtful, relaxed coffee house in their neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Rustic coffee joint with character. The bird theme is throughout the coffee shop which gives this place a good vibe. Coffee is organic and they have lots of options including delicious baked goods and fair trade coffee for purchase.  The only downside is their hours, they close at 6pm which is earlier than usual."}
{"text":"I love this spot.

Beautiful coffee, friendly staff, socially conscious, connected to the neighbourhood, lot's of seating, and a fabulous breakfast cookie.

Wish it was open past 6:30 p.m. as I would spend a lot more time there."}
{"text":"I'm sure the coffee is very good here but I've never had one. I usually come for a sandwich on the weekends and I love their breakfast cookie! 
Great atmosphere and if the weather is nice, grab a seat out back in their mini oasis."}
{"text":"Tried the soup of the day (Cream of Potato & Chives, excellent), Spinich Empanada (tasty), Brownies (also excellent). Atmosphere was definitely cozy, without being too much.

Excellent spot to grab some organic beans, and definitely plan to go back in the future. As a side bonus, also picked up my Aerobie AeroPress!"}
{"text":"Organic fair trade coffee for sale here! Try their blueberry soda, it's amazing!!  I like the warm and cozy feeling"}
{"text":"First and last visit here.  An americano coffee is a 1:1 ratio of espresso to hot water, unless otherwise directed by the customer. I got a medium takeout cup filled (first) with hot water and then a single shot of espresso dumped in. It was 85% water. 

At first I thought they were making a tea for someone. When the 'barista' handed me the cup I said, 'oh, that's a lot of water'. She said 'yes, you ordered a medium'.  The size of the order doesn't determine the ratio of water to coffee. I again highlighted the fact it was mostly water and she said 'next time you might want to order a small'. 

No offer to remake the coffee, but I guess that's implied when you're told you should have ordered a different size. 

My partner had the featured 'Ontario' coffee. It was super mild and lacked flavour.  The banana walnut muffin was overly floury and dry. The dark chocolate cookie was very good.

What the hell? We stopped in to support a local coffee shop in our neighbourhood instead of hitting Starbucks. Mistake. Starbucks baristas know how to make an americano.   Always 1:1 with 2 shots of espresso, 3 shots in a medium."}
{"text":"This place is an oasis in an otherwise desolate stretch of \"up and coming\" Mimico. I live there and love it so I can be a little tough-love about that part of Toronto. Anyway, I am thankful every weekend for Birds & Beans. Otherwise we'd be crap out of luck for anything resembling good coffee near my house. Next nearest is Cherry Bomb on Roncy. But back to B&B. Not only is the coffee delicious (kickass Americano), it is fresh roasted (they have their own roaster off site) and certified bird friendly, shade-grown, fair trade, organic, etc. It's got all the stickers. They also serve organic milk and cheese from an Ontario dairy, eggs that are from free-range, happy, steroid -free chickens, etc. You get the picture. Lots to love. Note: They no longer have live jazz on weekends because they turned that upstairs space into an apartment."}
{"text":"Great local coffee shop. Wonderful selection of coffee. Nice little patio with a view of the lake. GEM of the Lakeshore award 6+ years running?"}
{"text":"Great lattes, and my hubby loves their cortados.   We also love their fair trade bird-friendly beans, which you can even have delivered to your house via subscription!

Haven't eaten anything other than their chocolate chip cookies, but I can't go there and resist them.   They have milk and dark chocolate options!   They also sell a gluten-free cashew cookie.

Fridge has organic eggs and milk for sale, along with some soups and juices.   

Nice back patio, and close to the water, so always my choice for a stop before a waterfront walk!"}
{"text":"I think we can all agree that we've had a stellar summer (2014 was garbage, yes?). So we've spent most of it outdoors and biking. We always see this little cafe at the tail-end of our ride and we always say we'll stop there next time. Behold, it's September and summer was almost over when we finally did. We should have stopped by earlier because this place is awesome!

Coffee, sandwiches and empanadas were good but the star, for me, was the breakfast cookie. Healthy, with the right amount of sweetness, chewy and crunchy, perfect. I can eat a dozen of those. 

And their patio out back is nice as well. Like you're in somebody's cozy backyard with the lake just at arm's reach. 

Definitely a neighbourhood gem."}
{"text":"This is going to be short and sweet and straight to the point.  The coffee is good, the interior is comfy, and the back patio is really nice...however, the food offerings are boring and bland, the hours of business are awful, and the so called \"Baristo\" staff are rude and seem to all carry identical  attitudes.  
I go to this coffee shop because it is the only one in the Mimico strip.  PLEASE!!!!! someone open up another one that will blow this snobby, yuppy café out of the water!!!  It's funny how the owners are said to support the community, yet hire staff with no personality, and, from what I see - are only friendly to the regulars.  I've lived in this community for 17 years and I'm appalled that a community business such as this can continue to bring in such good business!  I'm straight up with anyone who asks what this café is like - good coffee...that's about it.  Maybe if the owner was more selective on who they hire, my review would go up a notch!  Stuck up, snobby staff and poor customer service are all major turn-offs for me and will keep me away more than anything else!   On my most recent visit over the Easter weekend, after having a coffee,  I wanted some water.  A jug of water is kindly left on the counter where the coffee condiments are.  I picked up a glass tumbler to pour the water into and it was filthy.  I asked one of the oh so friendly staff if they could give me a paper cup as the glasses were not fit to drink out of.  She responded, no, we can't do that -  \"it's only water stains\".  No offer to find me a clean glass or give me a paper cup.  Really, is it that hard to have clean, non-grungy drinking glasses for your customers???
So, if you like decent coffee, and snobby, rude and obnoxious staff...this is the place for you!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this little spot. They have a great little outside area you can sit at and it's right off the walking path. You can have your dog outside on the little patio too which is great! And they have bowls of water out for the critters which is double bonus.. I had the egg salad sandwich and it was good. It was pricey..6$.. but it's organic... I know organic is good but normally I'd just get a sandwich at metro for 3$ and be just as happy . The iced coffee is so good and people are friendly.  It's a nice little spot. I'd recommend"}
{"text":"Tough to review. I love the coffee and the baked goods (yum breakfast cookie!) But many of the staff are so brutally rude and snotty. I would never stay with a coffee as the glares from some of the staff are pretty hard to stand.
*update*
I don't know what it is, but I'd been going for years and enduring the consistent bad attitude and it seems to have shrivelled up. nothing but polite smiles for the past 6+ months. A great shift!"}
{"text":"Best drip coffee i've ever had. I'm a regular customer and I get their House Blend, dark choc cookie and breakfast cookie (a little too sweet for me). Will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Cool and convenient coffee spot in an up and coming area. I like the fact that is a local service, with v good customer service from the diverse employees. Atmosphere is cosy which sometimes means that it's necessary to bring headphones in to drown out particularly animated people. During the warm weather there is a really nice back patio...it's a race to grab one of those chairs! Good spot, good people."}
{"text":"This is my favourite coffee shop hands down. Their coffee is not only delicious, which is essential, but it is  also Eco friendly. If you're not a fan of bitter coffee but like a smooth flavourful blend then this is the place for you.  They also have some delicious treats and food items like empanadas, cookies, muffins and soup for you to try. 

They have three seating areas. One in the front and a section in the back with booths and a couple comfy chairs. There is also a great patio in the back with Muskoka chairs as well as some tables.  This coffee shop is located right along Lake Shore and backs onto the Waterfront Trail, so you have great views of the lake. 

The prices are great and the employees are very friendly. Highly recommend this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"West-enders, I've found your local answer for getting your caffeine fix on Lakeshore, but look alive because if you're not careful you'll drive right on past it.

Birds and Beans Cafe, is a no nonsense cafe with all the essentials that coffee-nerds (and work from home types - like myself) are looking for.

Fair trade beans... yup, they got'em by the bagful (and then some)!

Ample seating... yup, front and back, church pews, high-tops, sofas, loungers, low tops, the works really

Strong FREE WiFi... definitely, east to connect and just ask the barristas for the password (it escapes me now... but ask and ye shall receive). Quick connect and no authorization steps like at MCD's, Tims or S-bux

Collection of local peeps that make lurking over your laptop a ton of fun? Oh yes... awesome next level creeping for those looking for a distraction :)

Most importantly... how's the brew? Stellar, even the Decaf Americano gave me a little buzz and the taste was spot on a full caf version black with no pollutants (sugar/milk/cream).

It's cheap, local, does the trick... what's not to love!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to go to this place based on the good reviews. I love organic and the cause...but the staff not so much. When we went there it was super busy(we thought it's a good sign) we got two cookies and two sandwiches. They were good. The only thing that stopped me from buying coffee after having my sandwich was staff. Not a single smile
Or thank you or you welcome. Im not asking for a lot but friendly smile would be appreciated. So yes...i had my food and went for coffee somewhere else. Im sure coffee is good there but i rather get my coffee from a person with a smile on their face."}
{"text":"This cafe, located near the water front, is fantastic. I don't know why I enjoy it so much. Perhaps it was because while I was strolling by the water front in the winter, and freezing my hands off, I found a quaint little cafe that offered scrumptious hot chocolate and biscottis.

I came back in the summer to take my dogs to the water front and the same amazing biscottis were there, as well as perfect lattes made with organic beans. I love supporting small, fair trade establishments and our barista was a friendly, quirky guy.

He didn't say anything to us about our howling dogs on the back patio, and the atmosphere is so laid back. It's like stepping into a cottage. It really fits the area and is one of my favourite cafes in Toronto--certainly #1 in the West."}
{"text":"A neighborhood institution, Birds and Beans has great staff, great coffee, and is a real hit with anyone environmentally minded. (Birds and Beans is actively involved with big projects as a core part of their business model, check their site if you'd like to learn more)

Prices are mid-range, a medium sized \"fancy\" coffee will set you back about $4, but a medium filter coffee only sets me back like 50c more than a medium Timmy's - a premium that's more than fair to me, given the quality of the product and given that some of the money is going to a good cause.

Their lattes are p-h-e-n-o-m-i-n-a-l. There's something about them that's just extra rich and creamy and comforting. I've also enjoyed everything I've eaten - the breakfast cookies being a favorite.

Be sure to browse their magazine rack - it has all sorts of cool little neighborhood initiatives. Fliers for bird walks, communal sketchbooks, that sort of stuff."}
{"text":"Came in here just for an hour but the barista was friendly and made me a beautiful matcha latte with half water, half coconut milk. Wifi speed is good and I love the fact that proceeds go to help the songbirds."}
{"text":"Birds and Beans is a favorite local spot!Excellent coffee and fast, friendly service in a relaxing atmosphere with a nice patio. 

The food looks good although I haven't tried it. They also sell some basic items like milk and eggs in the fridge by the counter."}
{"text":"Great coffee!Every type. very good service & a delightful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is a coffee shop so it's all about coffee.

We happened to be in the area so we give this one a try. As soon as you walk to the entrance,  a burst of nice coffee aroma come rushing to your face.. which is a good sign! So we go inside and the decor has rustic touch to it and it has quite a bit of seatings so we didn't have any problems finding a table.

So we ordered latte and Mocha. The latte and Mocha both came with two shot of expresso .. woohooo ... It is a good cup of Latta and Mocha with nice aroma and decent expresso taste. Again, I am not a coffee expert so I am just relying on my taste buds and nose to tell me if I like the coffee or not... which I like them. :)  

The reason that I gave it a 3 stars instead of 4 based on two things:

1. There is no latte art ... is it a big deal to you? you will have to answer that yourself. :) For me, I guess it would be nicer if the latte/Mocha has some nice design on top, which I get used to seeing in Toronto coffee shops.

2. The not-so friendliness staff. I came with a group so we ordered several cups of latte with variations (e.g. one latte with 2 shots expressso and another one with one expresso and one decafe ... ). So when the Latte is made, the barista mentioned the name of the latte but we missed the name. so we asked again which one is which and the look of the barista facial expression wasn't pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is thriving. They've got your coffee and your pastries, your lunch and your snacks. It's homey inside, but the staff are always on the go filling orders. The service is charming and the overall atmosphere is comforting. I always try to pop in when I'm in Mimico and I suggest you check it out too! There's some spaces for those who need a work space, including a patio in the back. And it's conveniently located, right along Lakeshore Blvd."}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood cafe and I must say that I really like their food and their philosophy on serving ethical coffee. Their staff are mostly pleasant, decor warm and inviting and the atmosphere is the antithesis of hipster-ish pretentiousness.

It would be a wonderful place to do some reading, or chat with some friends. However , my only qualm with this establishment is their preference to play rather loud music at most times. I love music, but I'm not sure if a cafe is the best place for it. Most people visit cafes to work or chat, not to rock out. It seems like its only for the enjoyment of the staff. 

I noticed that I wasn't the only one to be frustrated by this. If they played their music on low volume (much lower than now!), I know that I would visit much more frequently and as would the people I know who go there.

Apart from this, I like to support local establishments and will continue to drop by this place occasionally - at least until they consider changing their audio levels and then I'll consider visiting more often and recommending this cafe to others who want a original, inviting cafe to hang out while drinking great coffee."}
{"text":"This cafe has such a great community atmosphere! Located in the heart of Etobicoke along the Lakeshore, this place was bustling with activity around 9:30 AM on a Saturday morning. 

There's a decent amount of seating (tables at the front and back of the cafe), and a variety of people visiting - families, couples, the token student on a laptop, etc. A very warm, comforting environment - mind you, it isn't the fanciest place (this isn't a Starbucks or a fancy Dineen Coffee by any means). But, it's homey, and they have great coffee (I ordered the cappuccino the morning I visited, and it was quite good!).

Their menu indicated a variety of caffeinated drinks, cold drinks, pastries, and they even have certain meal options in the form of sandwiches, soup, and other snacks (they had empanadas, roasted red pepper soup, and a 5 types of sandwiches available on the morning I visited).

A great spot, and good for a morning coffee, a casual lunch, neighbourhood meet-up, or snack."}
{"text":"Went in there last week and ordered a cappuccino and the girl made us lattes.
Told her we ordered cappuccinos and she told me the lattes and cappuccinos are the same.  
No clue what she was doing.  Gave us attitude, and told us we should ask for more foam next time.
If they are the same then why do they have different names? Girls working there have no clue."}
{"text":"Birds and Beans.
     Scratch my head curiosity ensues, huh?
          What does Birds have to do with Beans?
               WOULD you know the commonality of those Two?

Education, it seems is a wonderful device.
As long as it is in a Flyer format with Photos.
As I read about Certified Bird Friendly Coffee.  
Sounds gimmicky like what Organic use to be.

Copy & Paste (birdsandbeans.ca) -

The best way to help our migratory birds is to purchase certified Bird Friendly® coffees. Rather than being grown on land that has been cleared of all other vegetation, Bird Friendly® coffees are planted under a canopy of trees that provide habitat for birds. In addition to being shade grown, Bird Friendly® coffees are also organic, meaning they're grown without the use of chemical pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers that poison the environment.   3.5'd

{"text":"I went for a bike ride along the harbourfront bike trail and ended towards the last part of the west end. My friend suggested to go for drinks at a local coffee shop that has a nice patio. The place was quite small but the patio works up as a nice place with a garden nearby. 

All of us ordered cold drinks from the place which was the same price as other coffee chains. I guess supporting the local economy helps the community in the long run. The fruit smoothie was nice but a tad sweeter than I would have liked. Given that it was a hot day after a somewhat long bike ride, I drank the smoothie quickly. It helped get me back to near my house with a stopover by Ontario Place for a TIFF movie and music festival."}
{"text":"I love coffee and have been everywhere in the city - even roasted my own beans- but birds and beans is literally the best coffee in the city! Tip: try their Mexican dark roast."}
{"text":"The espresso is very good.  The cafe has a pleasant ambiance.  Staff is friendly not overly so.  The TV also provide Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"This is a nice cozy cafe... The coffee if organic and bird friendly and their milk is organic as well as the sugar which is pretty rare nowadays.. Some nice baked goods too.. 
Also they make a few sandwiches on site.. 
I always order their coffee and espresso from the website.. 
The owners name is Dave very friendly.. 
Just wish it was closer to home and had some more food choices that were organic too.."}
{"text":"Word 'Nice' comes to mind.. Boring stretch of the city, so it's nice to have a good coffee shop. Extended hours would be appreciated."}
{"text":"The perfect neighbourhood coffee shop.  Friendly baristas, lots of tables filled with chatty locals, delicious baked goods (chocolate chip cookies to die for) and fantastic coffee!  Also - environmental, sustainable, feel goody."}
{"text":"Good coffee beans.  Too bad they are roasted off site as I like the smell of a roasterie.  Nice cookies."}
{"text":"You can always count on great coffee at Birds and Beans, however the staff never seems very interested in being there. I've been going there for several for my coffee beans and the occasional cup of coffee in the shop.  I recommend them for both the amazing coffee and their efforts towards conservation."}
{"text":"This is a shining spot on a rather drab strip of sad looking, character-lacking retail. I ordered a small regular coffee and a spinach empanada. I don't believe the empanada was fresh but it was edible with a sprinkle of oats on the pastry. It is definitely a very different style of empanada. They've taken the Latin base and elevated it to a baked treat.

There is a modest lunch menu and enough desert treats to satisfy you."}
{"text":"Great iced mocha I have ever had in Toronto! Thanks for having such an amazing iced mocha for me... their bakery tastes pretty good as well!!! great vibe and patio!! Great place to hang out and chilling along Lakeshore"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite coffee shop. The owners are so nice and friendly. I live in Vancouver now but I still get my beans from this place. Love everything about it!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats the Americano's from Birds and Beans.  Wonderfully strong and flavourful.  Their Rainforest Espresso blend is to die for!"}
{"text":"Cute rustic cafe along Lake Shore west and not far from the trails. The staff was very friendly and there is plenty of seating some of which are repurposed church pews.

We ordered dark and mild roast coffees both of which were really good. I also had a cashew cookie which was really good and tasted like it was just made."}
{"text":"Great little coffee shop for the area. Have tried the chai tea latte and it was great. Worth a visit to!"}
{"text":"This is just based on grabbing an Americano - to-go - but this café seems like the antithesis of pretentious.  Sorta reminded me of a slightly newer version of High Park's Alternative Grounds.

Gleaming hardwood floors, a coupla vintage, wooden church pews, and the rest are a mish mash of random chairs.  Eclectic, quaint, but clean 'n bright!

In comparison to McD's/Timmy's, small = quite SMALL, but perfect size for me!  (I'm a coffee savourer.)  Americano, that I turned into a Ghetto Latté, was smooth, very smooth.   

Note:  Street Parking ONLY!  So drivers beware.

BONUS:  In addition to the fair trade beans, both cups + lids are compostable."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  It's artsy and beatnik, with live jazz on weekends and art on display by local artists.  Walk out the back door and take a few steps to the beautifully scenic beach boardwalk.  These guys are a block away from my home and I go as often as I can for their incredible bird-friendly coffee.  Also, you can enjoy delicious snacks and sandwiches, home-made ice cream and soups, all cruelty-free...right down to the cage-free eggs!  The owners of this establishment are wonderful and know most patrons by name.  The staff is young and friendly and, for people like me that always order the same thing, they're quick to learn your order so the next time you come in, they already have your coffee ready before you pay!  I love this place and would definitely recommend them to anyone!"}

{"text":"Coffee is great, food is yummy ( especially the tuna wrap!! Not too much mayo and tons of crunchy veg ) but it'd be great if they had more non- dairy options that weren't soy. Most specialty coffee shops have at least a non-dairy and non-soy milk option. Almond or coconut milk would be a great addition and would have me come in more often for my latte fix. 

Tl;dr - If you're not into soy or dairy: beware."}

{"text":"I feel like I am in a LOVE fest when I hanging and enjoying my Americano at Birds and Beans Cafe. 

Here all the coffees are organic, shade grown, fairly traded. Their house coffee is certified Organic-Bird Friendly. The Harmony Organic Milk uses to make the latte is coming from \"cows treated with love and respect\"...... 

Even the eggs they used in their baked goods are from \"happy chicken\" from Chicken Out! (http://www.chickenout.ca/index.html). The tuna in the tuna salad is certified are certified to be caught with minimal \"by catch\"... 

Nice patio at the back looking out to Lake Ontario.. if you prefer then stay inside for a more cozy home like atmosphere, with information about how coffee plantations in areas of the world has effect on different species of birds!

Having a coffee here at Birds And Beans Cafe supposed to be an earth loving, bird, cow, chicken loving and ethic experience... and with free WIFI but how come my Yelp friend didn't feel the love?? Oh he got stuck sitting right beside the washroom..."}
{"text":"Wonderful little coffee shop. A great place to hang out whilst studying or to meet a friend for coffee and a snack. Their home-made breakfast cookies are delightful any time of day.

Free Wi-Fi helps you stay connected and the multitude of times I've been there I've never been encouraged to leave even once I've finished my coffee. Seating is limited, but I've never found it difficult to find somewhere to sit.
I love sitting in one of the lazy chairs by the window and watch people walking by."}
