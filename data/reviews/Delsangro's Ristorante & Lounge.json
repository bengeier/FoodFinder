{"text":"Terrible survice and they barley ever stock their buffet which wasnt that good either"}
{"text":"This place is amazing now that Jimmy Paponetti is back.... food is great.... glad this place is back in the right hands.... a must stop destination if your in the area"}
{"text":"For price you get lots of food. Wonderful Italian food. Nice staff"}
{"text":"(BEWARE) This food would have been okay for a ten year old practicing Italian cooking for the first time . Beware of the management she is a smart ass. because she wants to charge big prices for jar sauce, dry chicken, tough eggplant, that's not worth eating . Bet they don't stay in business long!!! Don't waste your money should of went up the street to Goody they have better food."}
{"text":"Went there on a Monday evening, not very busy, I should have left then. The service was slow, I ordered veal Marsala, not real sure what I was served, it was one of the worst pieces of veal I have ever been served. It had been tenderized so much it was falling apart, the Marsala sauce was burned so badly and served with red peppers a first for me. Pasta adequate at best, the only thing that was worth the visit was the bread."}
{"text":"This place was a disaster.  Went here with my wife for a nice New Year's Eve dinner and it actually ruined our evening.  I was compelled to complain about the awful service and even worse food, which embarrassed her and led to a fight.  The place was empty and our service was still slow.  We ordered Chicken Marsala, menu price of $16 and was then told it would be $18 for the same plate but it was more because it was New Years Eve!?!  The food was uneatable and I would put it on par with hospital food.  We were served INSTANT mashed potatoes!!!  A $60 check for a meal that was worth $20, at best! Infuriated!!!  I don't even want to drive past this place again."}
{"text":"Visited here for Valentines Day in \"the old neighborhood \" where I grew up.  The decor inside has not been changed since 1990.  The sauce left MUCH to be desired.  It was like eating an unseasoned bowl of tomato soup.  Desserts were dry and bland.  Service was probably the best thing here as the waitress was attentive.  The food needs some major seasoning!  Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"I really don't need to write this review because I agree with the other reviews 100%. But I will.   The food was pretty much disgusting.  The service was awful.  The smell? Awful! It smelled like a ashtray mated with a urinal cake and had a restaurant named Delsangros.  Take heed - I don't hand out many one star reviews."}
{"text":"Garlic bread is A++++, worth it to go there for that alone.   Very pretty inside. Alfredo is good too."}
{"text":"Don't even bother. This place does not get any bussiness for a reason. Old and worn down inside. Food is bland and over priced. Only thing that tastes good is the bread...which BTW you have to pay to get extra brought out to the table. What restaurant does that?? Having to pay for extra bread that comes with your meal? Its ridiculous. They only have about 3 menus inside the entire restaurant so tables were actually sharing!! Servers are clueless. They have no idea what is even on the menu, let alone what kind of pop they even serve. Save your time this place needs to get shut down. Hopefully soon it will."}
