{"text":"I had the Weiner schnitzel and my girlfriend had the Gypsy's cutlet. It was good, not great. I have to deduct points for inattentive servers and expensive fare ($43 for two people - just too much). Also they feel the need to remind you several times via their menu that it costs them money to accept credit cards - come on. They also automatically threw on a 15% gratuity. OK experience but I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Cleveland!
Friendly, great service! And the food. It makes me sad there isn't a Hungarian presence in more communities so that this food was more common!
But if you want Hungarian food done well look no further than here.
Also I recommend a glass of \"Bull's Blood\" wine. One of my favorite types of wine ever.

Take a group so you can all order something else and share!"}
{"text":"I come from a Hungarian family and we love going to Balatons. Their potato pancakes and weiner schnitzel is amazing. My aunt gets the duck moat of the time and she says it's the best duck you can get anywhere except the Czech Republic. Great family owned restaurant and every time I've visited it has been wonderful."}
{"text":"This Hungarian classic restaurant is now located in Shaker Square in Cleveland, Ohio where it moved from Buckeye Road.  The portions are large and the food is authentic but lacks the kind of home made flavor one would expect.  The atmosphere is similar to entering a relative's home and is punctuated with homey furniture and tchotchke.  I wish the food had been better but unfortunately, the flavors were indistinguishable in both the stuffed cabbage and the chicken paprikash.  Remembering the Balaton from years ago, I was disappointed that the food had not retained it's former lushness.  Prices are fairly low especially considering the amount of food presented but sometimes less is more.  I'd much rather have less food with more quality any day."}
{"text":"This place is quintessentially Hungarian. The people working there reminded me of relatives of mine that were directly from Hungary. In fact, the lady that waited on us reminded me of a significantly younger version of my Hungarian grandmother in looks and personality.

To begin this review, if you know anything about Eastern European food, it is not for those watching their waist line.  However, there were vegetarian options for you non-meat eaters.

The restaurant was very neat and clean. This reminded me of all the old hunky ladies in my family who where EXCESSIVELY tidy.

To be honest I did not think the service was fabulous but it did not surprise me and I did not expect it to be all that great.  Most eastern European people (but not all) I've known personally are not all that warm and friendly.  They are very \"down to business\" type of people. But we did have a brief and pleasant conversation with our waitress who was very helpful answering our questions.

The beef goulash I ordered was wonderful. I loved my food! The beef was fall apart tender and bathed, deliciously, in the paprika sauce. I had the option of getting speatzel, mashed potatoes, Hungarian rice pilaf or fries. Who the hell gets fries with their goulash?? I opted for the speatzel which made my meal very filling. The meal is also accompanied by a simple salad of lettuce, red onion, tomato and a few slices of cucumber in a white vinegar dressing. . .very simple but delicious.

Prior to your meal, a basket of (I think Vienna) bread and butter is brought out to the table. Toward the end of our meal, I had to walk over to the kitchen to ask for more bread because there was quite a long while when there was no wait staff out in the dining area. However, when they saw me get up and walk over, they came out right away to, very pleasantly, accommodate my request.  

Oh yeah, I also ordered a merlot which was on the sweet side. I'm not a big wine fan but that wine was pretty good.

I tasted my husband's pigs in the blanket (cabbage rolls) and they were the best I've ever eaten. . .ever. So savory, tender and delicious. (I'm sorry grandma!)

We also ordered a slice of dobos torta to take home with us because we were so stuffed. Also delicious.

I loved my food and if in the area again, I would definitely come back to Balaton."}
{"text":"???????????????
??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I came to Balaton with my daughter for dessert.  Making a selection was difficult, partly because of so many good choices but also because the choices were of an Hungarian authenticity that made them unfamiliar.  My daughter avows that the texture of dobosh torte was just right.  The desserts were lovely and delicious.  The decor and service were charming.  

After observing the various dishes being served, we will be back for dinner."}
{"text":"Huge portions, fair prices, and pleasant servers! I ordered the vegetarian Hungarian Lecso. A hearty, healthy meal consisting of stewed tomatoes, yellow peppers, banana peppers and onions served over dumplings. Loved the white bread that came with the meal!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Delicious, authentic food and excellent custom service. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"delicious. all of the hungarian favorites are served here. creamy chicken paprikash With dumplings. goulash made the right way DELICIOUS hungarian wines. i can't forget the freshly baked bread and butter. the house salad dressing the dinner salad will make any hungarian feel at home"}
{"text":"I lived in Budapest for six months, and had heard about this restaurant before coming to Cleveland. I was overall pleased with my meal.  I hadn't really eaten all day, which was a good thing.  I had the Hungarian Platter, which is probably better shared and gives you a nice sample of a few things.  My only critique is that they had no Unicum or Palinka, which are very common Hungarian spirits and I was a little disappointed they didn't have either."}
{"text":"I read the reviews, so was expecting large portions. I was still surprised! The Hungarian platter lasted me 3 meals! This was my first time at a Hungarian restaurant, so I have no point of comparison regarding the food itself. However, I can say it was delicious and the flavors of the different dishes in the Hungarian platter complimented each other well. 

The service at the restaurant was also friendly, professional. My water glass did empty twice though, before being refilled, but I attribute that to be being thirsty on a warm summer's day opposed to inattentive service. 

Note: the decor of the restaurant was also quaint and lovely. Would recommend for a quieter night out and if you actually want to hear what your dinner companions are saying."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to say the service was shockingly bad and slow we won't be returning. We used to go there when it was on Buckeye and it was great.  Now our experience was so bad our beloved family tradition of going to the Balaton has ended."}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  Best Hungarian food in Cleveland.  Wiener Schnitzel is a must, the stuffed cabbage is excellent, and the Paprikash is also scrumptious.  As far as I can tell, everything on the menu is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is a classic, been around for over 50 years. Warm Old World decor. Friendly service. I ordered the Gipsy Cutlet (Cig√°nypecsenye): \"two slices of Hungarian seasoned pork-chops grilled with garlic and paprika-cream, and served with a mound of fried onion-rings\". I was a bit disappointed with it because it was rather greasy, but the onions were cooked to perfection. When i'm in the area again, i'll go back. I'm willing to give it a second change. Maybe i just ordered something i didn't like."}
{"text":"What makes Balaton the best Polish restaurant is Erica and her extended family serving traditional Polish and Hungarian culinary dishes! 

The portions will exceed your expectations. Service is first class an exceptional! Pastries are made from scratch, and the good thing you can purchase and take home!

The restaurant has a charm of the old world!  Do not hesitate to go...you will not be disappointed! You will walk out raving about the food and moderate pricing!

I am from Atlanta and came for the week! I will return home wishing Balaton Restaurant was in my home town!

Thank you Erica for a grand experience! I will return!"}
{"text":"Balaton was the perfect place to host our wedding rehearsal dinner. We recommend them for anyone looking to host a larger gathering. They serve family style food at an affordable price that includes salads and soft drinks, dessert and coffee. And the food here is incredible. Old-world Hungarian/German food made from scratch. The owners and their daughters were very helpful and managed our rowdy group with ease. They have a larger room that can hold up to 50 people, but we had 30 for our event. The room was very warm which is the only complaint I have. The servings were huge and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Family owned restaurant with good food.  Be careful to avoid the deep fries.  The hours of operation in Yelp do not match with actual hours.  First comes bread.  Appetizers are great.  Good vibe."}
{"text":"A little disappointing overall.  My mother is Hungarian and I was looking forward to eating here while visiting Cleveland.  The portions are large but not the quality was average at best.  The Wienerschitzel was dry and I think deep fried.   The staff seemed disinterested and I had to ask a second time to bring the wine to the table.   I will not be making a return trip the next time I am in Cleveland-there are too many better restaurants in town I have been to.   That is a shame because I am always looking for a good Hungarian Restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant and one of our favorites when it comes to Hungarian/Polish food. We tried it about a couple years back and was an instant favorite. Would definitely recommend Chicken Paprikash and Stuffed cabbage. We generally end up getting \"The Hungarian Platter\" which has both of the above mentioned dishes and Schnitzel and dumplings. 
In addition, it gives a very nice mom n pop restaurant feeling than the typical chain restaurant. 
Definitely, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Huge portions. Friendly service. Delicious, rich Hungarian food. Get the mashed potatoes as a side. Potato pancakes and stuffed cabbages  as starters. The family platter starter and the meat board is more than enough for 4 or more hungry people. Would be great on cold winter nights!"}
{"text":"Fantastic as usual!  Tilapia with risotto and steamed vegetables. Wiener Schnitzel with sp√§tzle.  Cucumber salad.  Took 2 Napoleons home for dessert."}
{"text":"This is Hungarian Clevelanders' best kept secret... The classic dishes such as Chicken Paprikas, Viennese schnitzel, lecs√≥, guly√°s and others are consistently prepared to perfection. The cig√°ny pecsenye (a plate of grilled meats) comes highly recommended. It's perfect with the cucumber or tomato or house salads, with homemade salad dressing. I get the Viennese schnitzel every time I go, and always end up taking some home because the portions are plentiful. Make sure you save room for dessert! There are few places in Cleveland where one has the chance to choose between classic European coffee house delicacies such as crepes, kr√©mes (french napoleon), hungarian Dobos (chocolate layer cake), chestnut cake and my favorite somloi galuska (walnut sponge cake layered with custard and rum soaked raisins with cream and chocolate sauce). Perhaps only restaurants in the quaint Hungarian countryside can compete with the dishes at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to Balaton for Valentine's Day. His family is Croatian, so he's a huge fan of the stick-to-your ribs, heavy Eastern European food. He also has a grandmother that cooks the best food I've ever tasted, so going into this our standards for ethnic cuisine were fairly high. 

Luckily, our meals did not disappoint. I ordered the \"small\" plate of Chicken Paprikash with spatzel and he chose the \"small\" plate of Wienerschnitzel with spatzel. They were both fantastic, but as many others note \"small\" here does not actually mean small. The man next to me ordered a large potion, and let me just say --  it was obscene. Unless you want to be eating spatzel for days, stick with a small. 

We took advantage of the dessert menu and order two things: dobosh torte and  cheese strudel. The torte was good and schmancy-looking, but the hands down taste winner was the strudel. The pastry was light and flaky; I'm a sucker for cheese so I was happy. 

The Balaton was great. I'd recommend it to anyone who craves hearty food. Be careful how you get there, though. It's located in a nice neighborhood but, no thanks to my Garmin, the route we took there was pretty rough. I'm no stranger to the city (i heart cleveland), but the the parts we drove through were down right scary. I recommend taking 480 and going through Beachwood if you're coming from the West side. It might take longer, but if you even slightly value your life -- it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. I prefer my own Hungarian cooking, but that's because it isn't *quite* as authentic. Lang√≥s, chicken paprika, sweet pickled cucumber salad, palacsinta with dios or t√∫ro, r√©tes, b√©gli, this place has it all. And the owners are sweet. It feels like sitting down in one of the hillside √©teremek overlooking the danube. Great location. Great for families. But be forewarned: Hungarian food is HEAVY. Now go!"}
{"text":"I loved it. Finally langosh how it should be. And stuffed cabage was the best I had in years! From first bite everything was so delicious. Thank you so much bringing this authentic cooking to the New World!"}
{"text":"Excellent Hungarian food served by nice people in a nice place.  Enormous portions."}
{"text":"It's places like Balaton that makes me rave about Cleveland dining. I've never tried Hungarian, Central European cuisine before. So one night, my girlfriend and I wanted to try a new place and after reading all the good reviews about Balaton, we decided to layer up and head out in the snow.

The restaurant is located in Shaker Square, where as you know is pretty developed and have a number of places to grab dinner and drinks. Balaton is located on the Northwest quadrant.

From recommendations on Yelp, we shared a cucumber salad and an order of the Wiener Schnitzel. I really really wanted to try the stuffed cabbage and the homemade potato pancakes, but I knew this place serve huge portions and the extra appetizers would have been too much. 

The Cucumber salad was good. Somewhat sour and tangy, but has a good crunch and complemented our main dish really well. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing. It really does have a feel of a home cooked meal. The dish is a generous veal-cutlet in traditional batter, then fried perfectly, and served with a side of applesauce, and speatzels. Even though we split the dish, it was still two full portions for each of us.

At the end, I had just enough room for the cafe expresso and Dobosh Torte. It's true what one reviewer said \"it'll be stupid to come here and not order the Dobosh Torte\" - eight layers of rich cake, with seven layers of smooth creamy chocolate, covered with hard-caramel. Holla !!"}
{"text":"Who can resist a warm and cozy-looking restaurant with ceramics and a beautiful antique Singer sewing machine in the window? It was lovely to be transported to Hungary for an hour or so at Balaton. The dining room is homey and comfortable, and the cooking is homestyle. We had two appetizers (the summer stew and the stuffed cabbages) and a side of speatzels, which was just right for a light dinner for two with no leftovers. Looking forward to trying the potato pancakes and goulash next time."}
{"text":"Delicious meal!  I had the weiner schnitzel (small) and it was plenty big.  Spouse had the Hungarian Platter with weiner schnitzel, veal paprikesh, and stuffed cabbage.  It was great_ lots of food.  The salad was the only non-great thing- it was awash in diluted wet dressing- obviously premade.  It was fresh lettuce though.  I had the 5 raisin dessert wine- so very sweet!  The dobosch torte was homemade and fantastic!   Our waitress was swift and professional.  I would return on another visit."}
{"text":"This is a badly run restaurant. The service is extremely poor and the regard for customers is low at best. We were looking forward to eating here and made a reservation. We asked for 830 and they told us that they close at 9:30 so we should make the reservation for 8 o'clock. We did. When we arrived early at 7:50 we were told that our reserved table would be available shortly. After an almost 1/2 hour wait, we left. As we left, we saw several empty tables that had either not been cleared or we're just empty. They don't know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Food was just OK. Service was absolutely terrible. We arrived received water and then were forgotten for 30 minutes. Waitress was rude when we reminded her we needed service, then all food came out at once apps, salads, and entrees. 

Portions were large, but lacked much flavor. The food did make up for rude slow service."}
{"text":"Good authentic hungarian food. Luved the nice friendly atmosphere. The food and wine selections were amazing. Service was very good . Enjoyed hanging out with friends. Will most definitely come back. Highly recommend this place for good authentic hungarian cuisines.
Thx 
DR MD"}
{"text":"This was the perfect place for date night. We ordered the Hungarian platter and had a sample of three dishes. We also had the amazing chocolate cake! So authentic I can't remember the Hungarian name. Haha. They were all amazing!! The convenient across the street location from the shaker movie theater makes this a great date night location."}
{"text":"First introduced to Balaton when it was on Buckeye Road.  Now the restaurant is located just east of Cleveland's \"Butcher Mile\" at Shaker Square.  It is EXPENSIVE for the value of the meal.  Wiener Schnitzel is not veal as is the traditional recipe, but the cheaper pork version.  Still has a nice flavour, but again for the prices.  I enjoy my once in every three year visit to the Balaton, but be prepared to shell out $$ and also, food quality isn't up to snuff."}
{"text":"Just like nagymama used to make! If you are of  Hungarian descent (which isn't much of stretch around Cleveland ;) ) you will feel like you just came home! The food portions are huge and the food is delicious. Planning on spending time...trust me, it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Balaton is slipping. We live in the square and eat here from time to time. The potato pancakes were almost burned and dry, saved only by sour cream. The goulash is greasy and fatty. The stuffed cabbage was tough. This place isn't cheap and Sokolowski's is a better value. Maybe they just can't compete with my Mother. We bought cookies to take and they were passed their prime. We probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Hungarian food, and I was very pleased with my experience! 

The decorations in the restaurant gave it a very homey vibe. This appears to be a family owned restaurant, and all the servers were extremely friendly.

I came here with a group of 6 friends, and we ordered 2 Hungarian platters to share. This was definitely enough food for all of us! I'm normally not too big of a fan of fried food, but this place has changed my mind :) The wiener schnitzel and onion strings (forgot what they're called) were just the right amount of crispy! I also really enjoyed stuffed cabbage! 

We did run to some problems at the end, as this restaurant does not split up the bill to more than 2 credit cards. However, this usually isn't too big of a problem! Overall, I'm very happy with my dining experience here and would love to come back again!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Balaton since it was on buckeye when you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the restroom! I am Hungarian with my father off the boat in the late 50's. The food is phenomenal and so is the service. The family owned restaurant has seen 4 generations of my family as well as we have seen 4 of theirs! Every good thing that was mentioned before me is right on point. Although i like the cucumber salad i prefer to go with the regular salad because the dressing is wonderful! As far as the desserts go, you people have it waaaaay wrong. The chocolate cake everyone is referring to, is a dobish torte. Its supposed to be a little stiff so it will stay together. It only has about a dozen layers! The caramel on top is like a hardened jelly and the easiest way to eat is is by taking the top off. The napoleon is also dynamite!!!! I hate salt i never use it and for people to say the food was salty are out of their mind!! any bad review you might see about this restaurant is from people who have no clue what good food is! The wine can be a little much for me at times. I like sweet wines so if your like me ask for the yellow desert wine, that's the best!"}
{"text":"The best Hungarian restaurant in North America. This place has a fabulous menu filled with house specialities that are all worth trying and coming back for. The Schnitzel rivals the best I've had anywhere, and that includes Austria. Great Paprikas, Stuffed Cabbage, soups and deserts. The Kremes is outstanding. The atmosphere is genuine, romantic and so comfortable. It truly is one of Cleveland's greatest culinary treasures. One of a kind in the US and not to be missed."}
{"text":"The food was OK but the service was horrible. We had to wait 1.5 hrs for our food on a Wednesday night. I had to ask 3x for my refill on water! I don't think I will be coming back here. Also not a fan of the stuffed cabbage."}
{"text":"A family favorite since they were located on Buckeye...I will always love the Balaton. Also, this is one local Hungarian restaurant my Grandmother did not get into an argument with the cook over authenticity. A story for another time...

As far as Hungarian meals go there really is no question that this is the best you will find in Cleveland. Portions are huge and easy to share or take home for tomorrow's leftovers!! I'm skipping right to the main dish. Sure the Potato Pancakes, Goulash Soup and the Cucumber salad are good, but you know you are going there-for one thing and one thing only. The main attraction. The Wiener Schnitzel is on the House Specialties list for a reason. It is battered and fried to perfection and the speatzels don't come in some wimpy portion size. Comes w/the perfect amount!! The Chicken Paprikash...tho isn't my grandma's...is pretty darn close and the dumplings are a must. My 3rd pick would be the Hungarian Goulash. Really you can't go wrong here!! WAIT! Did you save room for desert?? I think over time I have had almost everything on the dessert menu. Can't seem to remember a miss yet...

A family run establishment since the 1960's will soon win you over. Oh! Don't forget to say hello to the owner...who is usually seated in the back."}
{"text":"Had dinner on July 30 with 2 others.  I know the cuisine first-hand (I am a Budapest native).  The veal (borju) and nokkedli (like spatzle) were excellent; the servings were very large.  Bread was inferior.  Cucumber (uborka) salad was excellent.  The cuisine is authentic.  Service was good.  Balaton is for those who enjoy really good cooking, but it is not for calorie-watchers!  I had a bottle of Sam Adams -- this was a beer meal, not a wine meal, so I wish they had draft micro-brews.  Recommend."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. This restaurant reminds my wife and I of the German restaurants we ate at while in Germany. This includes the wait staff. Here you have to sometimes flag down the server for a refill or whatever. And we have had to ask for our bill. This is the same as in Germany. This is not a typical American chain restaurant where the server sits down at your tables he/she is your friend or brings your check two minutes after you get your food. There is no rush to push you out the door to make room for other customers. This what my wife and I enjoy about coming here. The food is delicious and filling. If you leave hungry then you have a problem. This is on our list of restaurants for repeat visits."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, came out fast and fresh. Great comfort food! We shared the Hungarian platter and it was perfect for 2; stuffed cabbage, chicken paprikash, spatzels, and Wiener schnitzel. The service was okay, a little slow to get seated and have our order taken even when it wasn't that busy but was well worth it the wait!"}
{"text":"Love this place!

Service can be a bit slow (tough to get someone's attention), but food is delicious and generously-portioned."}
{"text":"First time in Ohio and we decided to check out this place. It was the best decision we made! The staff was super friendly! We had a young woman with short blonde hair and she was such a sweetheart. The whole setting...food, people, decor was very authentic to the culture. 

Food was AMAZING. I can't remember exactly what we got but it was so delicious. I remember the stuff cabbage.... oh myyyyyy! So good! Dessert was amazing as well. Chocolate cake with hard caramel on top! 

Definitely worth the money you spend..... wish we had something like this in West Chester, because I don't know when I'll ever be back in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Amazing... Love it... Will definitely make another trip or should I say trips from Alliance to eat here! Yummmm"}
{"text":"Huge portions of delicious food. We ordered goulash, langos, chicken snitzel with potato pancakes, veal paprikash, and dobos cake. We took about 4 boxes home and had food for the next day."}
{"text":"This is where I go to eat when I want to go home. I can find stuffed cabbage at Polish or Slovenian eateries, but at Balaton I find what it should be. The same can be said for the beef gulyas or chicken paprikas. 

Many reviews compare the cooking at Balaton to good ole granny's. Well, as far as I know people have not been paying to sit at your granny's table for fifty years. I also know although my Hungarian grandmother was an exceptional cook always one of us did not like some thing she made. Thus do not expect to like every dish or for it to taste like what you grew up with. I have a friend who is widely recognized as being the worst cook anyone knows. But her grown daughters remember the wonderful dinners good ole mom made. So much for home cooking memories. 

Portions are large so well worth the prices. If I were Chinese I would find comfort in congee, if I were Southern I would find comfort in grits and butter. I am of  Hungarian descent so my comfort food is Balaton's nokkedli with paprika gravy. 

Surely the Wiener Schnitzel is the best you will find anywhere. 

Rarely have I or my companions had room for dessert. When I can, I order the walnut torte. No cassatta cake or red velvet cupcake compares."}
{"text":"I went there on a tuesday at like 5 o'clock, so it was pretty much just my wife and I. So the service was fantastic and everything, but I dunno what it would be when it is more full. The decor was nice, I don't really know a lot about Hungary but it all seemed Hungarian enough.

The food though was mostly quite good. Both my wife and I had the wiener schnitzel and that was quite tasty. She had mashed potatoes with it but those were quite flavorless and sort of clay like. I had the spaetzels, and those were some of the best I've ever had. Wife had some potato pancakes that I thought were awful and needed at least two spoonfuls of apple sauce to get past my gag reflex. She loved em though, so I must just hate potato pancakes.

I would definitely like to go back and try something I am less familiar with and some desserts that I hear are pretty good too."}
{"text":"When we visited Cleveland, we wanted to try some Hungarian food since there were many Hungarian restaurants over there. I did some research and we found Balaton. I really loved everything we tried in that restaurant, their bread was good, the stuffed cabbage soup is a must try and I also ordered the goulash! We didn't regret driving all the way there just to try their food. All great! The server was also very attentive and friendly. The place itself is really clean, has a nice atmosphere and the interior decor made it looked like you are dining in Europe. I would definitely recommend it and I would absolutely want to go back too!"}
{"text":"A little horseradish in your beet salad?

This is a great place that has hearty, satisfying, tasty food.  If you aren't familiar with Hungarian (and I'm no expert) I would definitely try it.  It is not what I would call challenging - most people will find things they like and it is different enough and excellently done.

On a couple different occasions I've tried several great dishes:

Beet Salad and Cucumber Salads are both fresh and great.

Their soups are amazing.  It's tough to get one because their portions are so big, but they are well worth it - get one as part of a meal sharing plan!

Their Hungarian Lecso is a flavorful, hearty (this word will get used alot) and filling stew with sausage.

Their Schnitzel is famous for good reason, and I totally agree with the recommendations of squeezing lemon on top, generously.

Also have enjoyed their Stuffed Cabbages (not quite as good as grandma's, but good) and Paprikash (including Mushroom, which is vegetarian).

My wife asked for gluten-free options and was given several.  The server was conscientious about suggesting things she could eat and even checked the ingredients on the dressing for the salads (luckily gluten-free).

I also enjoyed the Sour Cherry juice (not very sour) and tried a Hungarian white wine, which was nice.

I'll also echo the comments about portion size.  The larges are easily shared and the smalls will not be finished by many.

I loved the food in Hungary on one trip, and this definitely reinforces the goodness."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to admit that even though my own Grandfather was born in Budapest, I did not grow up with a lot of traditional Hungarian cooking. Sure, I had some stuffed cabbage and potato pancakes occasionally, but nothing else. And you know what? I'm pissed! 

I can't believe I was missing out on all this glorious, Eastern European goodness. Potato pancakes alone are reason enough to be upset--but then again, I did get to enjoy those frequently as a kid. 

Having recently tried a few other Eastern European restaurants, I can honestly say this is one of the better ones, yet. I mean, just the feta dip is mind-blowing. Seriously? The warm, homemade bread is delicious and the stuffed cabbage, although a little bit different than what my Mom used to make, is really, really good. I could go without the sweet salad dressing, but I'm definitely coming back to the try the chicken AND the mushroom paprikash. And don't sleep on the cold cut platter, or the family platter appetizers, just know that you'll most likely be too full to eat your dinner. 

I also really liked the traditional Hungarian wines and the family vibe. It might not have the kitschiness of Sterle's, but that \"family-run\" feeling makes up for it. 

I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Zomg! Perfection!

Can't count the number of times I've eaten here in my lifetime (50+) and have never had anything other than great food. Be warned: portions are ginormous! Szekely Goulash has no equal anywhere. I can't even make it this good, and that is saying something.

Walnut torte alone is worth a trip. 

Seriously, go here. Eat here. Make it a ritual."}
{"text":"Great food! Everything that I have had reminds me of my Hungarian grandma's cooking. From the decor to the staff, the moment you arrive you feel like family. Feels like you arrived at nagymama's ( grandma's) house. I suggest the schnitzel, its ridiculously good. While siting there and conversing with family, you hear them in the back pounding the veal. Again, it makes you feel like you are at nagymama's. Keep up the great atmosphere and fantastic quality of food."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. I have been a loyal customer for over twenty years, although for the first ten years I had no choice in the matter since I was merely a young boy. My parents used to take us out here at least twice a year, and I try to make it out there at least a couple times a year--although this is proving to be a difficult feat at the moment considering the fact that I live near the Pacific coast!

So why is the Balaton so good? This is just simply the most delicious comfort food out there!

I like to start with the Cucumber Salad; it's absolutely delicious and they have a really tasty dressing they use for it. Then I proceed to get a cup of the Goulash Soup. Next, I always order the Wiener Schnitzel and dumplings. It's a simple dish (similar to Milanesa), but they always make it so well here. It's basically thinly breaded veal fried to the perfect golden, crunchy texture. Be sure to squeeze the lemon over the meat. Oh, and if you go with a date, just order the large portion.  There will be more than enough to share, and perhaps take home for a friend. As another reviewer noted, the Boor's Blood wine is a nice tasty drink, and though I am not a wine connoisseur, I remember liking the way it interacted with the veal. Also, you may want to order extra dumplings because they are really addicting! They are unequivocally the best dumplings I've ever eaten.

Finally, I always like to order some dessert here, which, in my opinion, is absolutely phenomenal. I respectfully disagree with another Yelp reviewer who claimed the dessert here was mediocre. I actually think the crepes are delicious, and the seven layer cake is amazing. (My mom always orders the crepe and I order the chocolate cake). Each layer of the cake has a creamy chocolate filling followed by a crunchy layer of toffee or caramel --I can't remember which."}
{"text":"Interesting menu--Hungarian.   I chose veal paprikash for lunch.  Came with \"dumplings\" that I call spaetzle.    Wonderful taste.  Purports to be veal tips, but mine was veal stew meat.  Still plentiful, and good.  Fresh, crisp salad with various kinds of lettuce, tomato, and onion.  Good, friendly service."}
{"text":"A rare family-run, non-chain place - what my Hungarian mother would have cooked, had I had a Hungarian mother. Hearty portions, authentic tastes and atmosphere. The chicken paprikash is the best you can get this side of Lake Balaton. We say Igen!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It feels like home inside.  I'm not Hungarian, nor do I really know much of anything about this part of the world or the food, so I'm not sure how qualified I am as a reviewer.  However, I think I have a pretty good idea when food is good.  The chicken paprikash is delicious.  The bread is freshly made.  The desserts are amazing.  

They have a great location right on a corner in the heart of Shaker Square. If you're looking for a good spot to eat in the area, this is the one."}
{"text":"Crazy long wait for my food late Saturday evening.  They were so packed that a staff member came from the kitchen to help wait tables.  In the end, I waa last person to leave.  Had the mushroom appetizer and veal crepes with paprikash sauce, accompanied by excellent cabernet.  Owner and staff chatted with me at the end, regaling me with tales of the Hungarian history of Cleveland. All this made the wait worthwhile for real Hungarian food in a warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I live nearby, I am of Eastern European descent, and have recently traveled to Eastern Europe.  I have not been to this restaurant for a few years, but decided to return.  Parking can be a challenge, especially if people are rude and do not park correctly in the metered street parking and take up more than one space.  The building is nice, clean, well lit on the outside.  Inside, the motif is definitely ethnic.  The menu is basic, with a variety of ethnic delicacies.  The appetizers we chose were OK.  The potato pancakes were just OK.  We ordered the feta cheese dip, and did not enjoy it.  The side salads were fresh, small and tasty with the house sweet and sour dressing.  Then there are the entrees.  Made for carnivores, definitely.  The schnitzel was simply the best i have ever eaten.  Fresh, crispy, not greasy.  Even the small portion was more than I could handle at one sitting.   The spaetzel is great.  The stuffed cabbage and chicken paprikas was very good.  Then there are the desserts.  Nice variety, and worth saving room for.  If you like Eastern European food, this is worth the trip.  Service was definitely slow, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I stopped in here before heading out on an 8 hour drive back home to NJ. The place seemed a bit fancy and has a very quiet and formal atmosphere so I felt a little out of place alone and in sweatpants. The staff was very nice and the food was absolutely delicious - I had to fight my primal urges to not finish it right there and then as I was afraid of falling asleep during my long drive. I ordered the chicken soup and the stuffed cabbage leaves with dumplings. The portions  were a good size and I basically got 1.5 meals for ~$25. My only complaint is its too damn quiet - otherwise 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I went here with a party of 4. I had the Lesco with smoked sausage, my wife ordered the vegetarian version of the same dish. The stew was a composite of tomatoes, red and green peppers with herbs and paprika. It served on a bed of crumbled dumplings. I rather enjoyed my dish even though it was a little too salty. The sausages had enough salt for the entire dish. I would definitely visit again and try the other dishes. 
Please stay away from their unremarkable desserts. The crepe we ordered was dry and stiff, and the flambe refused to catch fire. The 7 layered chocolate cake put up quite a fight as if it had been refrigerated too long. It had a caramel layer on it that chipped and spun of the plate
The service is exceptional and the decor is part of the fun."}
{"text":"I know I am about to be heckled by all the fans of this restaurant but my chicken paprikash was a very average overpriced meal. I did like the atmosphere of the place and the wine. And the sight of the owner cleaning up the tables was simply breaking my heart. I plan to return and let the galore of the European dishes convince me otherwise. But so far dining there felt like going on a date with a guy who is good on paper but you just don't feel it for him. So here I said it - I wouldn't have married my paprikash. That's all. Sorry."}
{"text":"Made a reservation.  When I arrived on time , I was told that I would have to wait.   He didn't even check the book for my reservation.   15 mins later,  we were seated.  It took another 20 minutes after seating to get some water.  After our order was finally taken, the wait staff basically rushed us out of the restaurant.  Food was okay, but the cabbage rolls and chicken pa prikash  werw both dry.  Salad dressing was watery.  Their dressing is usually thin, but it now seems that they are stretching it.  Overall, an underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"A family restaurant and has the best Hungarian chicken around and all of America that I've tried"}
{"text":"This review is from our visit on Sunday, May 25th.  
We made a reservation for 11 of us to celebrate my parents 50th anniversary.    When we arrived an older gentleman, I assume to owner, told us our party was \"in the back\".  Having never been there before we looked around to see where to go.  That is when he again said \" I said in back!\".  Um, OK.  We did finally see where to go and joined our party.

Let's start with the service.  Three of us arrived 10 minutes after everyone else.  The waitress never came over to ask us if we wanted something to drink.  We ended up ordering our drinks with our dinner.  Also, she never asked anyone if they needed refills during dinner.  If you wanted one you had ask and she seemed put out by the request.

Now let's talk about the food.  The salads all had old, dark wilted romaine and they had slimy parts in it.  The lettuce should have been thrown out and not served to anyone.  The dressing was watered down and tasted like sugar and vinegar.  The Wiener Schnitzel and the Chicken Schnitzel were very good.  The veal Paprikash had some very tough meat and some very tender meat.  The liver Paprikash was good.  The veal goulash was good but salmon was very dry and the thyme on it had been burnt to a crisp.  It should have been removed instead of served. Speaking of the salmon, my son ordered the tilapia but was told they didn't have any which was why he ordered it.  I ordered the family appetizer for my dinner.  It had breaded mushroom caps (excellent), potato pancakes (good but too crispy for my liking) and two cabbage rolls (filling was good but the cabbage was tough).  I didn't realize until writing this that I never got the chicken livers.  The chicken livers and potato pancakes were my main reason for ordering it.

While we were still eating the waitress started bringing out boxes for leftovers.  We found that to be rude and felt rushed to pack up and leave.  The waitress never asked anyone if they wanted coffee or dessert.  My sister-in-law had to ask for some apple strudel.  On the menu they list four kinds but she was told they only have cottage cheese.
Overall not an experience I would repeat."}
{"text":"Have been to Balaton 3-4 times.  The food has been very good each and every time.  The 3-star rating really is just a reflection on the service.  They are quite slow and sometimes a bit curt.  My most recent trip was with four other people and we were going to dinner here before going to see a movie at Shaker Square Cinemas.  We got there an hour and forty-five minutes before the movie, and we just barely made the showtime.  We had to knock on the kitchen doors to get the check from them.
Aside from the service; however, the food has been delicious every time.  I would highly recommend the stuffed cabbage and the potato pancakes.  Although it is a little pricey, you get a salad, bread, and a very large helping of food for the price (even when you get take-out).
Overall,  I would definitely recommend Balaton. But be prepared for a fairly long meal."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service.  Note that many entrees are offered in \"regular\" and \"small\", where \"small\" means substantial and \"regular\" means ginormous.  I've always been impressed with the deserts there as well.  Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I love Balaton . I can't even think of any thing I don't like . It takes me back to a civilized time like the Cleveland I grew up in . The children and grandchildren of the original owner are still working at Balaton and the service and the food is always delicious . I tend to stick to the chicken paprikash and a cucumber salad .. and I also love the homemade chicken noodle soup , especially good on a cold winter day . The Shaker Square setting adds to the charm .. if I could give Balaton 10 stars I would"}
{"text":"Although my grandmother was off-the-boat Hungarian, I didn't appreciate her cooking when I was a kid. Toffee cake? No thanks, I'd rather have a Snickers. Veal paprikash? Schnitzel? What, we can't go to Taco Bell?

But when I come to Balaton I realize what I missed. This place has seriously some of the best Hungarian home cooking there is to be offered in the states. You know it's old-school ethnic when there's a guy sitting around the dining room sipping from a glass of wine, and it looks like his only job is to smile at people as they walk by. 

As for the food, it's fantastic. The bread alone is worth it, but definitely order a cucumber salad with a veal, chicken or mushroom paprikash, and you will leave here a better person. They have two choices for most dishes: small and large. I ordered a small, and it still looked like they dumped the whole pot out on my plate. Daaaaamn good stuff. It almost makes me want to go to the east side more often. Almost."}
{"text":"I just had one of the greatest meals of my life at this place. Staff is sweet, the portions enormous and the flavors blew my head off. The fried bread that you slather with oil/garlic and sour cream? I was beside myself with happiness. The beef goulash was just beyond belief. Very, very happy."}
{"text":"This food is AMAZING!

First, their homemade bread is delicious. Their salads were nothing special, but the dressing was very good.

Sizing: get the \"small\" if you want a regular meal. Get the \"regular\" if you want 2-3 meals.

My dish: weiner schnitzel
This dish was tender, crispy and moist. The speatzel was delicious and the sauce and breading had a well rounded, perfectly balanced taste/seasoning. I was served 2 HUGE cutlets. Seriously, I couldn't even finish one! It was served with chunky applesauce and 2 wedges of lemon. My brother doesn't even like veal and he kept asking me for another bite.

Dish #2 (that I got to try): beef goulash
The meat was tender and mixed with the perfect amount of onions and stewed tomatoes. The sauce, served over speatzel, was well balanced and left you craving more.

Dish #3 (that I got to try): stuffed cabbage
The filling had a mild seasoning which continued to develop your tongue even after you'd swallowed the morsel. I don't even like sauerkraut and I thought it was delicious!

The atmosphere is open and family-oriented. On the sound system played a pleasant mix CD of \"piano bar\" music, mixing classic tunes and showtunes. We came during the mid afternoon. Due to the lofty ceilings, I imagine it would be hard for older people to hear during the busy times.

On our way out, we bought a loaf of poppy seed roll fresh from the oven - literally as it was being taken off of the baking sheet.

The acoustics and the salad were the only thing keeping this place from a 5."}
{"text":"For those of you unfamiliar with this type of food (as I am), the wiener schnitzel is a breaded and fried piece of pork that looks and tastes exactly like a Japanese tonkatsu.  In fact, so much that I kind of wished I had some tonkatsu sauce while eating it tonight.  Also, apparently dumplings aren't dumplings so much but actually more like gnocchi.

But anyway, this is a nice cozy restaurant in shaker that serves very homey, tasty Hungarian food in extremely large portions.  The menu makes it seem pricey, but actually my girlfriend and I were both full after sharing a hungarian platter (schnitzel, stuffed cabbage, and paprikash) for $26 total.  We were here with friends and everyone ordered small portions of their meals and still didn't finish it all.  The food was all very tasty, and we were glad we tried something new.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"A great restaurant that has both great atmosphere and food.  Family run and with a great old country feel, the food is solid. I has the stuffed cabbage appetizer and the Lesco Stew with sausage. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Went with the family and an extra friend for dinner before seeing the Christmas lighting ceremony at Public Square.  We ordered the Hungarian Platter and a side plate of cabbage rolls to try.  The cabbage rolls were not my favorite, but everything else was delicious.  We tried an assortment of tiny cheesecakes that were all great."}
{"text":"I grew up on Buckeye Rd, where the original Balaton's was located. My mom didn 't prepare most dishes at home, so after grandma died, Balaton's was the place we went weekly for home cooked Hungarian food. For me the tradition has carried forward in my post-Cleveland years. Each and every time I visit, this is one of two stops. I rotate between the  weiner schnitzel, chicken paprikesh, and stuffed cabbage.  In most instances the meal is complemented with spatzels (mini-dumplings). So while over the years they've moved to Shaker Square and their prices have increased, nothing has changed in terms of the quality of the food served here!"}
{"text":"The navy bean soup is amazing.  Quite possibly some of the best soup I've had in some time.  We shared the Hungarian platter, which was wonderful.  The schnitzel was perfectly crispy, and the cabbage rolls were my favorite, very flavorful.  The chicken paprikash could use some more flavor, but maybe it was the strong flavors of the other entrees on the plate that drowned out the more subtle taste of the paprikash.  I wasn't too impressed with the dessert.  I had the chestnut cake and it was dry and a small portion for the price and quality of it."}
{"text":"I spent 10 days eating in Budapest, so I feel qualified to comment on the authenticity and excellence of this establishment. Balaton is great!

Potato pancakes ($7.95) are an excellent appetizer, crispy wonderful served with sour cream. Ask about cherry juice. It goes well with the food here.

Order the Wiener Schnitzel ($21.95 large/$16.95 small) or Veal Crepes a la Hortobagy ($17.95). I also love their Stuffed Cabbage rolls ($15.95).

The schnitzel is tender and thin inside, carefully breaded and crisp fried outside. The veal crepes Hortobagy are absolutely delicious - hot savory, pancakes filled with tender veal and smothered in creamy, rich paprikash sauce.

The homemade dumplings or Speatzels here are fantastic. Fresh, tender and beautifully complemented by the sauce and the meats. ($3.95 as a side)

Portions are large. If you cannot decide what to order, try smaller appetizer portions of the entrees or have a combination plate. This will help you save room for dessert, which you should because the Hungarian strudel is really quite lovely.  ($3.50)"}
{"text":"My Hungarian girlfriend and I were planning a celebratory dinner and were looking forward to it all week. We know the place closes at 9, so we arrive at 8:15. When we get there, they tell us they are done serving dinner and the kitchen is closed. My girlfriend speaks so highly of this place, so we are both incredibly disappointed and cannot believe a great restaurant like this would stop serving dinner at such an early time. Especially before they close. This is unacceptable. If you are going to stop serving food 45 minutes before you close, then close when you want to stop serving food, so we don't get excited for a dinner that may never happen again."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Cleveberg I had a taste for some classic EEF, [Eastern European Food] & I remembered an old haunt, The Balaton. So we headed over to Shaker Square, the Original, of the now trendy Old Neighborhood mini mall concept malls popping up all over America, to get my ethnic fix.

SS had a sidewalk renovation a few years back & a lot of the old places took the opportunity to bale out of this Classic bit of Americana but the Balaton stayed, thank the Force! Anyway I was not disappointed. The place was the same as it was the last time I was there maybe 8 years ago. Spotlessly clean with the same simple classic old Budapest cafe decor!

Ah, now onto the great classic food. The first to arrive was the Classic Vienna white bread & butter. This in itself could be a meal in itself! The bread, made with lots of yeast is superb when slathered with great real butter. Needless to say I had to force myself to stop eating so I would have room for what I was dreaming of, the Chicken Paprikash. My SO decided on the beef Goulash mit Spaetzle which had me doubting my choice for a bit. Anyway to cut to the chase, the food arrived in a very timely manner & needless to say we were not disappointed. My Paprikash & her Goulash were plate licking outstanding. Just the right blend of sour cream, butter, herbs & spices, onions, garlic & the secret, caraway seed! Ah I can still taste it now & after just having home cooked beef Goulash from my own recipe which, BTW, is pretty outstanding itself!"}
{"text":"Being of Croatian descent I know something about the items on Balaton's menu and have to say this place has been a big disappointment.  We have eaten there on several occasions the latest with 2 organizations whose members chose Balaton of dinner.  This last Christmas season we ate there and the food was cold, one person was smart enough to send it back but we had already waited too long.  The next group dinner not much changed.... and they shorted us the dessert which was supposed to be included.  There are far better places in Cleveland which serve central Europen food.... and at half the cost  The only thing positive is the decor"}
{"text":"Old school chicken paprikas, cucumber dill salad, and some dobos torte for desert.   Simply outstanding.  

If you are looking for old school Cleve and Hungarian home style cooking, Balaton will make you weep for more.  If I was a local, I would eat here weekly.     

What a gem"}
{"text":"The portions are astounding, the quality is exceptional, and the staff are very exciting people.

If you are ever going to have a wild weekend in Cleveland this place should be on the list of places to go."}
{"text":"Wow, what a lovely place. I was aware of this before our trip to Cleveland, as my heritage is Magyar (Hungarian) and I was checking out places we may want to visit. I had not intended on driving out of downtown for this place, we were going to make a stop at the R&R Hall of Fame, however, after spending a lovely morning with the ladies at the Cleveland Hungary Heritage Society Museum, we were in the mood for it. They highly recommended the place, and I'm so glad we decided to take their advice.

This was about a 15-20 minute drive from downtown. It could potentially be faster as it is only about 6 miles away, but there was a lot of construction on the way and on Shaker street, where we ran into some detours. On the way there you will drive through some neighborhoods that look a little down, or just working on a turn around, but don't let that discourage you.

The restaurant is located on Shaker Square, which is a lovely area with some small shops and restaurants. There is a good amount of on street parking, but you will need some quarters for the meter (1 quarter=30 min.) The store front looks a little sleepy, at first I was worried it wasn't open, but when we opened the door we found a good amount of people seated, enjoying their meals; we went for lunch about 1pm.

We were greeted promptly and a table was set up for us. We only waited a few minutes between our arrival and being seated to be asked about drinks. All of the staff we encountered was welcoming and eager to please. Very interested in how we found out about the place, as well as finding out about our shared heritage. The person who spent the most time with us was a blond with very, very short hair who was more than happy to talk to us about her cooking, offer some tips, and direct us to a little Italian store that happens to have some Hungarian products available. She made us feel very welcome.

Now for the food...really, really good! It was great to see so many authentic options on the menu: starters, entrees, desserts, etc...and while my mother and I are both born and raised in the US, with our trips to Hungary and having Hungarian heritage on both sides of my family, we've had a good amount of this type of food. This was as good as anything we have had when in Budapest. They also some Hungarian wines on the menu too, my mother had the furmint, and they have Tokaji asz√∫, which is known as 'The king of wines, the wine of kings.'

For a starter my mother got the cucumber salad. A favorite of both of us, but something we don't make nearly enough of. They use an english cucumber and slice it wafer thin, as much water as possible is removed and it is put in some rice vinegar, sugar, paprika and some garlic on it. Served with some sour cream. Really nice take on it.

My starter was the beef goulash soup. I generally prefer my beef and veggies to but cut a little smaller so that I don't have to bite things in half and so that I get some of each ingredient in every bite...aside from that, it was fantastic as well. Mild flavor in terms of spice, although I would imagine you could ask for it a little hotter if needed. I generally like it hotter, but I was happy with the taste. The mini dumplings in it were tender. 

My mother's entree was a small order of stuffed cabbage which can come with dumplings or mashed potato. She went with the potato, which was awesome when you had some of the delightful sauce on it! The sauce for the cabbage was so flavorful, perhaps the best I've ever had. It only had the slightest amount of tomato in it, and I'm imagining my mom will try and make it this way as well.

My entree was the potato pancakes, small order. Couldn't finish them because I was too full after the bread and soup. I did have half of the dish and the apple sauce, both were great! It is also served with sour cream. 

There were many traditional desserts, as well as some cookies and strudel and poppy seed roll available for purchase to take home. We opted to take a poppy seed and apple strudel with us since we were so stuffed. I had both the next morning for breakfast, wonderful. I'm pretty sure some of the desserts are made in house, and some may come from a local bakery that does Hungarian desserts...either way it was all good stuff.

Highly recommneded, will be returning when we go to Cleveland again, no doubt about that."}
{"text":"Front door wide open restaurant was full of flies.  My wife actually had half of a fly and a wing in her salad. Brought it to waitress attention her reply was doesn't matter how many times they was it that happens sometimes.  No apology at all  never asked to refill our drinks.  Mediocre food with high prices.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"The best Hungarian food I've ever had!  The portions are huge and so delicious!  Goulash, and Chicken Paprika are to die for!  Love it!"}
{"text":"From the early 1600's & on, my family originated in Luckovice, Bohemia... so we are no strangers to good old fashioned traditional made from scratch home cooked Hungarian meals. Even when my grandfather came here to the US, the women in my family continued to make, grow and utilize everything themselves. So since the passing of all of my extended relatives, my father hasn't eaten Csirke Paprik√°s   since his mother passed away because no one makes it like mom. My sister was really excited to take us here for Father's Day this year and we all had very high expectations for the food in hopes that my father would finally break his anti Paprikas streak. Our experience was so terrible I was overwhelmed with disappointment & truly find the experience to be saddening. It's not that the food was bad, although it wasn't like my grandmothers (traditional Csirke Paprik√°s is made with a sour cream sauce not a gravy with a dollop of sour cream) but the unforgettable customer service - there are no words. 
   We had planned on having a party of six & had made reservations, upon walking in your are taken away by the beauty of the woodwork & furniture. What you're not taken away by is a hostess or even a server. We stood there waiting, and waiting and.... and even though we were definitely  seen we were not seated. My mother got annoyed and we all moved towards a large counter were we continued to be ignored as server after server walked past. Once we were finally seated it literally took 30 minutes just to get three drinks and an additional 30 minutes to get additional drinks when the rest of my family arrived. 
  My husband had become very ill with the flu & couldn't make it, so I had placed a take out order at the same time my original order was placed. My soup never arrived with my meal but my Lapcs√°nka's were so huge that I didn't have room for it. I thought that maybe our non vocal and practically non existent waitress had misunderstood me and placed the soup with my carry out order & thought nothing of it. During the entire meal, our very short blond haired rude waitress NEVER came back to our table, once! She never checked to see if we received our food, if it was okay, for refills, etc... nothing! The only nice employee there was an older gentleman who was busing tables  who we flagged down after waiting over another 20 minutes for our check. And, of course, I was charged for the soup I never got...this is when the evening went even further downhill. 

   Since it was our first visit & our waitress said not one word, I didn't know if she would come back & take my payment or if there was a register somewhere so I stood at the servers counter and waited an additional 15 minutes before (whom I assume is the owner) finally spoke with me. He was crisp and clearly confused when I tried to explain that I was charged for the soup and kept disappearing into the kitchen and running around like a complete nut. Instead of offering to just get my f*cking soup so I could get the hell out of there he made the biggest deal about removing the $3.00 charge from my bill. I mean he REALLY went out of his was to be a complete *sshole!!!! He took his good 'ol time (over 20 minutes!) and then had the nerve to tell me he refused my method of payment (a debit/credit card) because it is a requirement that your bill must be $30.00 or more to use a card -WTF!!!! 
   First off, I could see a $5.00 requirement due to the rising cost of using a credit/debit machine but $30.00! I'm pretty sure this jerk was lying to me but I didn't feel I had much of a choice other than to leave without paying. Thankfully I had some tip money in my purse and was able to barrow additional money from my father but most people don't carry cash these days & even so- why isn't there a very clear sign directly on the door stating the outrageous pricing requirements!?! Then when I gave him the cash he took an additional 15 minutes to complete the transaction. 

  I will absolutely NEVER suggest or return to this awful place ever again unless its to punch the owner & waitress in the face!"}
{"text":"By far one of the most delicious comfort food meals ive eaten in recent years. The place was as welcoming as my grandmother's kitchen and just as stomach filling. I garuntee you will leave full, happy, and with plenty of money left in your wallet. Service is a bit slow but its worth it!"}
{"text":"This place is located in the busy shaker square area. Not that extravagant compared to the restaurant nearby but definitely is a good place to try! The dinning environment was very honey and I really adore the old restaurant owner. When me and my bf ordered a whole platter, he said that's a lot of food lol very nice of him but we wanted to take the leftover home. The platter itself was very big, probably enough to serve 5 people or even more. I liked the sausage, the chicken and veal ( I guess that's everything). For the side we ordered the homemade dumpling - a must try!, cabbage noodle and red cabbage. The price was pretty reasonable too. Service was ok. I only gave it four star cuz I'm not a big fan of breadcrumb covered fried food, but if it is your jam, you should try it out!"}
{"text":"We loved the food, the atmosphere, and the warm friendly service. This took me back to my Hungarian roots. Just loved being there!"}
{"text":"If you are reading this, then you should know to drive Shaker Blvd. west until you reach Shaker Square, then look for Balaton in the northwest quadrant (i.e., to the right as you approach the square).  Further west, your surroundings deteriorate.   

Miss G. brought my parents, my daughter and me here for dinner on a Sunday night.   Great service and ambiance, and portions are generous.  Great bread.  I drank iced tea.  The small wienerschnitzel and spaetzle I ordered were quite large portions, especially after the stuffed cabbage and potato pancake we had as an appetizer.  Miss G and I wish we would have split it.  The large version of this entree should be large enough to split even without any appetizer or bread.  Dad had a few boxes to carry home that night."}
{"text":"Im Hungarian from Budapest and my mother in law lives around the corner from Balaton. When we come to Cleveland we always make sure to stop there, and I can say that it is truly authentic, spectacular Magyar food, exactly like back home. And the owners are lovely. Thank you and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Balaton has been featured in the Sterns' book Road Food, and we got the opportunity to try it out this trip. Located in a strip of shops in Shaker Heights, you may need to drive around to locate parking. 

The interior of the restaurant is beautiful, very rustic. Service was efficient and we were able to enjoy our meal quietly. The menu is laid out with Hungarian and English names, well described. There are quite a few vegetarian options for entrees, which was a nice surprise.

You are given soft bread and butter to fortify you while you gaze at all the menu selections. Many, many traditional items on the menu, as well as Americanized standards. I ordered the Lecso with Sausage - a tomato-based stew. Great flavor and plenty of ingredients. The spouse ordered another stew, the Hungarian Lesco - which was another tomato based sauce with peppers, onions, and rice - and very much enjoyed this dish.

Glad we made the trip down to Balaton, and plan to visit their other restaurant in Lakeview when we are next there."}
{"text":"I don't complain much, maybe they had an off night. I dunno- but by far the worst meal I've had in my life. I was thinking of what would Gordon Ramsay say? Do Clevelanders have low expectations or something? Issue one: we got seated and no one came by for at least 10 minutes. Servers were walking around as if we were shadows and the place wasn't crowded. Issue two: when the server finally did come by, she asked if we were ready to order. No drink order? My wife and I ordered. I asked if I could have a Grolsch. That took another 10 minutes. My wife ordered the stuffed cabbage and I had the wiener schnitzel which I swear was double breaded in sand. The stuffed cabbage was meh- edible but that's about it. The Spaetzle was missing one key ingredient- flavor. I also ordered the potato pancake which was gastly. I could taste flour and grease but no potato. They looked like those crab like thinks in Alien that stick to your face, which probably would've tasted better. THe Wiener schnitzel hardly had any meat in it and was pounded so thin you couldn't see the damn meat inside and it was double breaded for that oh so good greasy bland bread crumbly taste. It was so dry I may use the leftovers to exfoliate my skin. If you want a better option of Euro fare- go to Sokolowskis in Tremont or Das Scnitzel house in Parma. I apologize for having the slam this place- but son of bitch! It was awful."}
{"text":"I am in Cleveland frequently enough for work and to visit family and I try to sniff out the local fare I can't get at home. My sister's boyfriend recommended this place and I am glad he did. Ridiculously generous portions. We got the Wood Plank.... a meal that servers \"2-4 persons\" or so says the menu. More like 4-5. A veritable carpet of schnitzel and pork chops with sides, salads, and bread ensue. Really, all of it was quite fantastic and reminded me a lot of grandma's home cooking and what I ran into abroad in eastern Europe. Not sure what all the \"it was bland\" is about in some reviews. Schnitzel isn't exactly a complex dish and the goulash was plenty paprika spicy... the pork chops were smothered in onions, bacon, and seemingly sun dried bell peppers. Also, get the summer stew. The sausage in it are like these little buttery slices of heaven. Hardly bland by any standard. It is a tad pricey though... thus 4 stars."}
{"text":"We wanted to find some good ethnic food on an art-centered visit to Cleveland, and we were not disappointed in Balaton. I'm not of Hungarian extraction, so I can't speak to how \"authentic\" the food is, but it's really good--not haute cuisine, but like a really talented home cook would make. I had the pork goulash, which was flavorful and satisfying. The pieces of pork fell apart at the touch of the fork, and were well-trimmed (So many restaurants are careless about serving fatty, gristley meat.) Cabbage, onions and sauerkraut gave the dish a rounded, earthy element, and the sauce was redolent of paprika. (The paprika tasted toasted, but not burned--another mistake I often find in paprikash preparations.) The dumplings soaked up the gravy, and had a proper bit of tooth to them.

A (good) warning: I am a big eater, and I was starving when we clocked in at Balaton after 1:00. I ordered the small portion, and left 1/3 on my plate. I can't even imagine who could eat their \"large\" portions.

The restaurant was super clean, comfortable, and the service was efficient and friendly. I will return to Balaton for my next Hungarian food fix."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for very rich and delicious food, then Balaton is a good bet.

I keep coming back for the chicken paprikash with spaetzle and a side of purple cabbage.
It's so good I can't get myself to try anything else on the menu.  The portions are large.  So, they offer smaller versions for those less hungry.  

Some desserts are seasonal and one of my favorites is a chestnut pudding."}
{"text":"Three generations of my Hungarian family dined at Balaton.
Though my family is from Hungary, I being American born and bred never tasted true traditional Hungarian food. I  figured the tastes would be similar to German food, but with more paprika and sour cream. I was pleasantly surprised. 

I had the mushroom paprikash with sliced portobello mushrooms, onions, buttery spatzel, all served together in a stew like consistency. My dish was light, delicious, and comforting. 

The 2nd generation had veal schnitzel or weiner schnitzel. Tender veal 
that cut elegantly with a knife. The dish came with spatzel and a small salad with a lightly sugared vinaigrette. 

The 1st generation had her mother's favorite recipe to cook which was the stuffed cabbage. With every bite my grandma recited stories of her childhood in Hungary. Grandma even said that the violinist who used to play at the restaurant was an old friend of hers after she moved to Cleveland.

Overall Balaton was a beautiful introduction into Hungarian cuisine. My palate has opened to food of my heritage and I can't wait to try more delicious entrees.

{"text":"Entering Balaton is akin to being teleported through the doorway of a kindly old Hungarian woman's home.  The decor and the staff really are quite pleasant, however the food and the pricing left something to be desired.  We had the Stuffed Cabbage and the Chicken Paprikash, both of which were not the most flavorful dishes.  Honestly, the chicken tasted nearly identical to the copious amount of dumplings we received with each meal, bland and dry, relying heavily on the slathered gravy to add body to the meal.

The staff was quite attentive and our meals were brought out quickly, however pricing was rather atrocious.  Most meals ranged between $14-$16 for \"small servings,\" and larger portions nearing $20-$25.  Certainly I have no qualms with spending some money on an excellent dining experience, but the quality of the food and the atmosphere of the establishment don't garner that kind of expense.  Perhaps Balaton could pass as a quaint family run dinner, but it certainly isn't the cultural and existential food experience that yelp plays it off as."}
{"text":"We come here EVERY time we're back in Cleveland with my family~its become tradition to come here to celebrate birthday's as well. It's an authentic Hungarian restauant set in quaint Shaker Square. 

I always get the chicken shnitzel (or weiner shnitzel) with dumplings- yum! Always sub your salad for the cucumer salad. And of course you must dine with some Hungarian wine. For dessert, finish off with the chesnut puree, topped with whipped cream! You'll feel like your in Hungary here!"}
