{"text":"Quite enjoyed. Delish food. Good service. Huge, clean, and lovely space. Will return."}
{"text":"The shell of the xiao long bao is thin and taste good. However not as good as in China.  The beef noodle soup. The soup base is very clean and noodle is cooked to the right consistency.  Unfortunately, they got my order wrong so took a bit longer than I would like to.   New restaurant so the layout and decor is very clean.    Price point is average. portion size is fair."}
{"text":"The price at Xiao Long Bao really deep, the food was ok. The waiter greets you all the time .  However this restaurant seems to be targeting people that were more on the wealthy end, that is willing to pay.  Make sure you packed enough cash when you visit here.  You can easily spend $50 and more for a simple lunch.  If they lowering the price to make it more reasonable, I am sure they will draw in more customers."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings here are among the best in Scarborough . Though the other dishes can be kind of oily/greasy. The price is not cheap but would come again"}
{"text":"This have a spacious decoration and comfortable seating.  Came here on friday night and immediately got a seat. The several times i have been here, their xiao long baos are quite good and juicy, it is a must have every time. However i have tried their spicy beef noodle and their sweet rice roll they are nothing special. I feel like the quality of their other dishes is just on par with some of the food courts out there.  However I do like the fact that they have excellent service and accept credit card unlike most chinese places.  Overall I would only come here for the xiao long baos and go elsewhere for an actual meal."}
{"text":"Best xiao long bao in Toronto! I think it's better than ding Tai Fung. Beef pancake was so so. But will be coming back here for the soup dumplings! Got some to go too! Very addictive."}
{"text":"Read a lot of good things about Xiao Long Bao and wanted to try these dumplings at this location.  Not sure why so many people gave this place more than 1 star.  The restaurant is in a large plaza with easy parking, lots of tables and clean looking.  Staff was attentive but the xiao long bao were not good.  They were made with pork and so the xiao long bao were full of pork fat not soup.  The restaurant did not offer a variety of meat dumplings.  I would have enjoyed the dumplings more if there was chicken dumplings.  The only item we thought were okay were the snowpea leaves stir fry with garlic.  Try a different place if you crave xiao long bao.  We are not going back here."}
{"text":"Foods are nice and restaurant are very Clean. This is one od the restaurant that we will come back to visit next time we are here."}
{"text":"It was pretty good, I wouldn't say I'm impressed by the food. It could be because I've had Xiao long bao from Shanghai"}
{"text":"So the restaurant named is actually called 'Xiao Long Bao' just like the name of the steamed bun soup dumpling. We had about 7 ppl eating, and we ordered loads of food and might I say it was quite pricey for Asian Cuisine.  Things ordered for this group: 4x Xiao Long Bao with pork and crab (6pcs) each 1x mini steam dumpling (12pcs) each 1 order of beef wrapped foil. (3-4) cut up roll 2x order of pot stickers (5pc) each Hot & Sour Soup Braised Pork Belly with Egg Drop Soup and Steam Rice Jelly Fish App Beef Braised Soup Noodle Eggplant veggie. Shanghai Noodle Egg Souffle Dessert (4pc) per order. Looks like a baseball size! Shrimp Mayo with pineapple sauce!  All this stuff to feed 7 ppl and I still can't say we're all full, because 3 hours later writing this review, I am HUNGRY!!! Price was about $30 pp with tips!!!  Pros: XLB were good and fine.  Pot Sticker Dumpling were good size portion. Egg Souffle Dessert were good size and nice try with black sesame. Very Spacious Restaurant. Nice and clean. Prob cuz its a new place.  Cons: Small portions most dishes. I guess you can call it 'Tapa Style' for Asian and its meant for sharing.  Overall...I guess I may pop by in the future if I have a craving for this as its not too far from my area...But other then that, I may pass."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very spacious with a large window to the kitchen as part of the open concept. Great thing about this is that one can easily see how clean the kitchen is as well as how the food is handled. The downside to this establishment is that it can be very loud. By that, I don't mean only the customers that are loud. Throughout my entire visit, I could hear the very loud humming what I thought was the air conditioning. Paper menu ordering sheet that is provided is also in Chinese only. On top of that, the food here is also pricier by Chinese standards; I most likely won't be coming here again due to the price.  Siu Long Bao, #14 - $5.99 It's your average soup filled pork dumpling done right. Dumplings here aren't torn in any way, have plenty of flavourful soup inside and has a soft skin wrapping it. Some places have a more tough skin but this is not the case here. Dumplings were decent but still not worth the price.  Veggie Dumplings, $5.99 Your typical veggie dumpling.  Shanghai Stir Fried Noodles, #59 - $10.99 What happened to this dish? I suspected that it would be fairly bland before even eating it from the almost anemic looking colour when served and I was right. It was like the chef forgot to finish seasoning it, decided to add a lot of veggies and only put a bit of meat in it. On the plus side, it didn't look like it had a lot of oil so I suppose it should be a good pick if you're elderly or want something healthier; basically if can only eat bland food for health reasons.  Steamed Bun with Sweet Condensed Milk, #23 - $3.50 I believe #24 is the fried option of the same menu item. I just prefer the steamed version as it is slightly healthier. Bun was freshly steamed, soft and piping hot when served. Combined with the sweet condensed milk for dipping, this dish was very tasty. I would be worried if the kitchen could not make such a simple item properly.  Ja Jeun Mein This item I didn't order but I noticed that it had a spicy symbol on the menu. Authentic Shanghainese food is known for being sweet and oily. This dish is never spicy so I guess it is a Beijing style Ja Jeun Mein."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food that is equally as great! I visit this location quite often and always get the soup pork dumplings, which are my favourite. I also order the chicken and egg fried rice, the pork dumplings and the wonton soup. Any complaints I did have in the past were fixed with great customer service, which is exactly how a business should be run. I have given feedback to the workers at this location, without expecting or asking for anything in return, and they have surprised me by fixing the issue or accommodating me, without even being asked! Highly recommend, this place is great! If you've been debating it, stop - just get in your car and go try this place out"}
{"text":"Great food, spacious atmosphere and pretty quick service.   Personal food recommendations: the XLB obviously, green onion pancake, and dandan mein"}
{"text":"Ordered the Shanghai style noodle and the double boiled beef noodle soup and there was no meat in both bowls. Soup had no taste. Definitely not worth $20."}
{"text":"We got here pretty early (one hour after they opened on Sunday) and even the main hostess (supervisor) hadn't come in yet. We were led to our table by one of the servers who wore a permanent glower on her face. For the remainder of the meal, we always approached her colleague dor anything we needed. Perhaps it was early but we received a pot of water and one for tea...but the only difference was how one was clear and was one slightly tinted yellow-- the only way we could figure out that they hadn't made an error and gave us two pots of water.  I hadn't come here for half a year and much has stayed the same. I'm usually a fan of the xiao long bao (signature dish) itself and it did not fail to disappoint. Meaty, juicy filling encased within a thin wrap.  We also ordered a savoury chi fan (fresh crunchy dough fritter and decent amount of shredded pork bits although it all fell apart a bit too easily), spring onion cake (crispy and savoury), braised beef noodle in soup (the meat was a bit tough), pork pot stickers (meaty and somewhat juicy) and the red bean filled pastry. I liked the red bean dessert as it was crispy, a bit chewy and contained a decent amount of red bean filling (some places may put in very little).  Overall a good lunch experience and good value for money."}
{"text":"This branch of the Ding Tai Fung is absolutely outstanding!  The Taiwanese food that they serve are all very freshly made and you can see the chefs making them through the kitchen window! As other Yelpers have mentioned, it has a very modern and clean, open-concept design, and it also has free Wi-Fi.  The service is excellent. Whenever you need something a waiter or waitress will also see you as soon as you raise your hand, or even before you do that. If you accidentally drop your eating utensils someone will bring you a clean one wrapped in a napkin almost right away.  This restaurant is very consistent and will definitely not disappoint you and your guests. I would definitely recommend it!  Washroom rating: 10/10"}
{"text":"They have more portions than your typical dimsum place. We tried xiao long bao, siumai, fried rice, beef pancake and dumplings. Xiao long bao is a must try. Fried rice was expensive for its portion."}
{"text":"My love for ??? continues ... so we need to keep find new places with good ??? to eat. We tried this restaurant tonight here in Scarborough, it is suppose to be the sister restaurant of ??? in Markham. The restaurant was big and spacious, not like the typical Chinese restaurants where the pack all the space with seats, lots of room between the tables.  We ordered a few dishes: ??? (Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings) -  very juicy, thin dumpling wrapping. ???? Double Boiled Chicken Soup - clear chicken broth, the noodles were very chewy. ??? (Dan dan noodles) - it was not spicy, but fill with peanut sauce, the same noodles as the other noodle dish, very chewy. ??? (fried beef pancake) - steaming hot, juicy on the inside. ???? (Red bean pancake) - hot off the fryer, crispy on the outside, but needs more red bean paste inside.  Overall, the food quality is pretty good on the dishes that we got. I like it better than ??? for sure. Seating is more comfortable so that might made the meal more enjoyable. Let's see if this quality would keep up overtime."}
{"text":"Good Shanghai food, underrated, will come again. Not a lot of people, good tones. The main xiaolongbao dish is on par with the bigger names out there."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favourite places to grab xiao long bao in the city!  It can get pretty busy at times, but the food is consistently delicious. Perfect for a meal with friends, brunch with the family, or simply to go for good old-fashioned Chinese comfort food. It's also my go-to place to order out when I have a cold; there's absolutely nothing better than a warm bowl of savoury soy milk soup for the heart and soul.  The Good: The restaurant itself is clean and modern with spacious seating. The food itself boasts amazing flavours that are both rich and comforting at the same time. My boyfriend and his family first took me here a few years ago, and I've been in love with xiao long bao ever since. The ones here are made fresh (there's even a little window at the back where you can see the chefs prepare them!), and are always bursting with soup and juice. Also really enjoy the savour soy milk soup here. My friend Lisa recently introduced me to the wontons in a spicy chili oil - they're delicious! Definitely try those, too, if you have room to spare. Even if you don't get the wontons in spicy chili oil, I'm a big fan of the spicy chili sauce that they have on each table here and love dousing my dumplings in them.  The Bad: Can get a little busy at times, but the wait never gets too long. Also, sometimes the seating can be a bit awkward just because of the size of the tables (i.e) a table of four often gets seated at a large, circular table for 6-8 people, etc.) Nothing too fussy, though!  The Ugly: How much I end up ordering and devouring when I get there. Definitely can't be good for my health, but #YOLO, no \"ragratz!\" ;)   Bottom line: Amazing food at decent prices, with flavours that never fail to disappoint. Call me a fan. I'll definitely be back...multiple times."}
{"text":"Food is A-OK.  The freshly made dumplings were good but pricey."}
{"text":"This place looks to be an offshoot from Ding Tai Fung in Richmond Hill.  Menu and layout looks the same.  In my opinion, Ding Tai Fung has the best xiao long bao in the city and this place did not dissappoint.  A convenient local Scarborough location for those craving good Shanghainese food.  I will come again.  Spacious, clean and wheelchair friendly."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday at 7pm, no problem getting a table for 3 adults and an infant...we figure it's because this located in the corner of the complex, may not be catchy enough to draw attention. Delicious and authentic Northern Chinese cuisine...I prefer this place over Asian Legend! Service is better than most Chinese restaurant, clean and bright inside, able to see preparation of handmade dumplings and noodle via glass window which is a nice feature. We had the traditional xiao long bao; tasty soup inside.  Also had traditional pickled veggie pork noodle (noodle made in-house), wuo tip (pan fried dumpling), pork & veg wonton in soup, radish pancake and of course hot sour soup.  Everything was tasty and came out in a timely manner! If you are looking for some reasonably priced tasty Northern Chinese cuisine in Scarborough, definitely check out this place!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered 6 dishes and they were all mediocre. Ding Tai Feng is a lot better."}
{"text":"Came back here with my folks for a quick lunch.  Had the crab meat xiao long bao, which were just ok (lots of soup inside), the pan fried buns were soggy inside and the meat was terrible.  Shanghai noodles were just ok as well, I like the soy to be a bit more complex and flavourful, and then drunken chicken was pricey as they remove the bone but it's mostly drizzled with alcohol sauce and not nicely marinated (plus sliced too thin to enjoy the fatty chicken skins).  Overall a disappointing meal, even my parents said they wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and has a great interior. We ordered some cold noodles, the xiao long bao (with crab meat), sticky rice roll with dried pork, onion pancakes, dumplings in spicy sauce, and red bean pancake dessert. I liked the overall quality of the dishes. Especially, the xiao long bao had the hot rich soup inside that kept me going for more. The bill was a bit expensive, but I'd say it was worth it. I would like to come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I Kung Fu Panda these babies so. Dang. Hard.   No, no, I'm not going around punching children.  I'm talking of course about the soft and pillowy, soup-filled namesake dumplings.  Available in regular pork or crab tomalley/meat filled variety, the xiao long bao are delicately encased in a semi-sheer wrapping with the delicious hot broth swirling inside.  The proper way to enjoy one is to place one on your spoon, take a small bite from the top to allow the mouth-burning steam to escape, dribble the tiniest bit of ginger & red vinegar inside, then eat it whole to allow the fillings and broth to flood your tongue at once.  Alternately, I've also heard the best way is to actually sip a bit of vinegar from your spoon as a palate cleanser, then dip the dumpling into the vinegar, place a sliver or two of ginger on top, then place the whole dumpling in your mouth and allow for maximum pork fat broth goodness.   Really though, I think any method of dumpling eating is fine.  As long as you don't pierce the skin and release the soup by accident. That's dumpling murder, and will bring shame to your family. For shaaaaaame!   The rest of the dishes are OK.  I like the beef tendon noodle, spicy-peanutty soup Dan Dan noodle, crispy and mildly spicy pork ear cartilage too, but the real draw is the xiao long bao.   Man, I love dumplings.  And pandas.   The restaurant is much larger and more modern than their sister restaurant, Ding Tai Fung at First Markham Place, and does allow payment via credit card. The acoustics of the room are terrible though, and even at half capacity it will be as loud as a busy dim sum morning. Get reservations for prime lunch and weekend evenings or risk standing to wait for seats."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this place is only 3 stars! I thought it was so good, especially the dumplings. The service wasn't the best, but the food was delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go to for shanghai style dim sum..All the food is made to order (including the steamed dumplings) which means it takes a little bit longer to get your order.  Prices are reasonable (we spent $40 for 4 people). The food is not overly oily like I find at other northern chinese places.  Menu ranges from dumplings to fried pancakes to noodles and rice to meat and veggies dishes.  There's something for everyone."}
{"text":"At first when we came in; it looked very spacious and the atmosphere was very clean and comfortable. The Xiao Long Bao was great, however the pan fried buns were a big disappointment, the steamed bun part was mushy and hardly crispy on the bottom. The Dan Dan soup noodles were watered down and was tasteless. We also had the Spicy Eggplant dish and was very greasy. We also have Pea shoots with garlic which was pretty good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to get my fix of dumplings. It is a great sign when you walk in and find a glass wall around the kitchen where they are and assembling dumplings. There are towers of bamboo steamers waiting to be filled with various dumplings and cooked.  We tried several and none of them disappointed. We had the pork and shrimp dumplings, pork soup dumplings and wontons in chili sauce.  I would order each of them again, but preferred the wontons in chili sauce.  I will be creating these. We also tried the green onion pancakes and sticky rice rolls. Everything was great and I would go back."}
{"text":"So I have been selfish... been putting off reviewing Xiao Long Bao cuz I want it all to myself. The restaurant itself is big and bright with lots of parking. I've been here with different number of groups from 2 to 12 and were able to get a table fairly quickly.  Super fresh dimsum come out very hot, juicy and delicious. XLB - main reason why I go here. They have the mini one but I'll stick to the tried and true. If they made a jumbo one... well then that's another story. Siu Mai - huge dumpling with the shrimp on top. Squid Tentacles - seasoned and fried very well.  Other dishes like noodles, beef and soups were pretty tasty but portions are a bit small.  I have to say that i really like the service here; very quick, attentive and they are all smiles.  They don't get the full 5 stars cuz there's no har gow (probably not a Shanghainese dish) and the other dishes are pricier than usual. But I will definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"So far the best Shanghai restaurant in GTA in comparison to the bigger brand names or well known Shanghainese restaurants around the area/ Markham.   Their food is great, servers are attentive, prices are reasonable, spacious and clean.  Xiao Long Bao was tasty, skin was thin, juicy pork and lots of soup inside the bun that's not fatty or greasy.   The fatty pork rice with preserved vegetables was amazing! I had it with vegetable rice. Sauce was just right in flavor, not salty. The pork was tender, fatty (you can cut those part out) but that fat is what brings out the flavor of the dish. Over all I will reorder this for sure!"}
{"text":"Service is actually amazing and the interior of the restaurant is pleasant. However the food is below par in my opinion and the price is a little high for what it is. I probably wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 star. I much prefer this place over Ding Tai Fung despite being from the same owners simply because it feels like a more spacious eating environment and I personally feel that food quality is more consistent here.   On 2 different visits I've tried the mini xiao long baos, the regular xlbs, the crab (?) xlbs, shanghai fried rice cakes, wonton noodles, and pan fried pork buns. What I found was that your best bet is to order from the column where you get the XLBs, so essentially the cheaper snacks.  I found that the more expensive dishes were actually less well executed than the cheaper ones so I guess they're just trying to deter people from ordering what they're weak at w/ a higher price? The quality of the xlbs are always consistent (I saw a supervisor literally staring down the ppl in the kitchen making sure everything was done right) but I really suggest trying out the other snacks like the pan fried pork dumpling as well!  Service is also fairly good, especially for a Chinese run restaurant. Waitresses great you with a smile as you leave and enter the restaurant. I do wish that the paper menu would have both chinese and english though since I'm chinese illiterate. Luckily I visited with my parents on both occasions, but it makes me wonder if there are less selections in the English menu or whether prices are marked up there or something. Someone should go and compare the two menus! [Maybe I will in the future]  Overall, good place to go for lunch, but nothing truly exceptional. Would come back when in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"The xiao long bao are good at Xiao Long Bao.  Not as greasy as their other restaurant, the fake DTF in Markham.  We ordered a few other dishes: tried pan fried meat pockets which were tiny, the chive and egg pockets were just okay as well.  The sticky rice roll was alright too.  It's very spacious, clean, and shiny.  Good for large groups and sharing family style.    Just get the xlb.  The other stuff is overpriced and the portions are small."}
{"text":"I came here a few times now for lunch. The place is super fancy for an XLB house, but the food remains decent so the decor is really an added bonus. The first time I came, they handled our large party poorly, bringing duplicates of plates and forgetting others. It was a weekend and they were crowded, but it left a sour taste in my mouth. When I came back again, we were a much smaller group on a weekday and the service was much better.   The XLB here are decent, juicy and flavourful but the skin is a bit thicker than I would like. I also ordered the chicken noodle soup which is perfect if you're just gathering a cold - it's so homey and the broth is fabulous. We ordered a plate of bok choy and fish in an insane chili sauce (so spicy!) and both plates were great.  I wouldn't mind giving it one more try to see how the consistency plays out, but if you're looking for an XLB place and you're too far from The Dumpling King, this is a good alternative."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a sister restaurant to the famous Ding Tai Fung at First Markham Place. In comparison, I prefer Xiao Long Bao because it is more spacious and the impression is that it is cleaner.  Food wise, I would recommend the classic xiao long bao itself. The food is definitely comparable to Ding Tai Fung. Xia long bao portion is decent and all has soup inside the bun. Next thing I would recommend is Beef Noodle Soup (BNS). BNS noodle is thick and texture is firm. I personally prefer thicker and firm noodles because it has fewer chance of being soggy.   Last dish I would recommend is \"Long Chao Shou\", which is spicy dry wonton. The specialty of this food is that it has the spicy touch to the wonton that we normally eat. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Expensive. Low value for money IMO.  Xiao Long Bao and dumplings were tasty enough but you can get much better value for dumplings at \"Dumpling Restaurant\" at Sheppard and Brimley, \"Mother Dumplings\" / \"Dumpling House Restaurant\" in old Chinatown on Spadina.   Shanghai fat noodles were stir-fried nicely but the portion size was embarrassing. The noodles portion were about 1/3rd what any other congee / noodle house would serve you.   Beef rolls were dry and lacking flavour.  We came for lunch and paid $52 including tip for a Shanghai noodle, xiao long Bao, steamed dumplings, potsticker dumplings, beef rolls and a beef soup. $13 per person that worked out to a small bowl of noodles, 4 dumplings, a beef roll, and half a bowl of soup. We left hungry.  You need to pay $20+ per person to get your fill.. but for northern Chinese style food? Nah bro, that's too much.  If you want to help Xiao Long Bao pay for their high rent charges and renovations, by all means... But we will not be back."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings on point! Toronto didn't disAppoint with good food. Definitely will be back here again!"}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch today. We arrived at 2pm and the restaurant was pretty full. We ordered a variety of dumplings and other foods. Xiao lung bao were ok. We ordered the regular ones and the pork and crabmeat ones. There wasn't much soup in them and they were quite small. The steamers are much too large for an order of 6 per portion. We got steamed chive dumplings, these were bigger but filling was too loose. Pan fried dumplings were nice. Stir fried rice cakes were nice. The preserved veg and pork soup noodle was ok. The worst food we got was the beef pancake roll. Not much beef and too much hoi sin sauce. Really small pancake, not worth getting. The garlic snow pea tips tasted ok but there wasn't many on the plate. My cousin had been here before and said the dish was twice the size before.  Place is huge and there's not that many servers. Quite hard to flag someone down to refill tea, get extra napkins etc. Would not come especially here just to eat. Food is not that great and I've had much better at other places."}
{"text":"Excellent xiao long biao, pan fry buns, and potsticker dumplings. This restaurant is across from the Chartwell Plaza at Scarborough, with the original in First Markham Place."}
{"text":"I'll put this one as 3.5.  This restaurant is huge. So spacious, clean and modern. It's a completely different feel from the Ding Tai Fung at First Markham Place but I liked it a lot.   We stuck to the traditional items such as the Xiao Long Bao, Panfried Pork Dumplings, Green Onion Pancake, Panfried Pork Bun but added an order of Shrimp & Pork SiuMai to spice things up.  Xiao Long Bao ($5.99 for 6) is fantastic here! The dumplings were filled with the right amount of soup and came out at the perfect temperature to eat right away without burning my tongue. They were soft, tasty and perfectly-sized.  Panfried Pork Dumplings ($5.99 for 6) were also enjoyable. They were panfried just enough and the filling was wonderfully in proportion to the wrap.   Green Onion Pancake ($3.75) was just OK. Maybe it was personal preference since my boyfrend liked it but I thought it was very plain and had too little green onions. Although crispy, I like the ones at Chinese Dumpling House more. These are also slightly more expensive than average.  Panfried Pork Bun ($5.99 for 5) was a total miss. There was barely any filing and pretty much 90% dough. It's such a staple item but they don't make it well here. I'd skip this one for sure and now that I think about it, this was probably what affected my rating for this place the most.   Shrimp & Pork SiuMai ($6.99 for 6) was quite big in size and had a shrimp on top. This one also has a soup filling and the opening at the top makes it nice and easy to drink the soup. These tasted and looked great!  I didn't have any problems with the service - helpful and attentive.   Solid place overall but there are some major misses on the menu. I would return for more of their XLBs and to try their noodles."}
{"text":"Never knew about this restaurant, thanks to yelpers, came on a weekday.    The service was quite attentive, someone was always walking back and forth, waiters with their heads up seeing if anybody is waving for their attention, dishes cleared off quickly after they were done.    The renovation of this place is nice and spacious, very comfortable seating.   The menu is in English and Chinese with pictures. Nice touch is everybody gets their own dish of ginger to mix with vinegar. Don't need to share with others.    We ordered the 6 piece siu long bao, very juicy and filled with soup. Didn't realize they had the mini ones, otherwise I don't mind trying those ones!   We got the fried silver bun with condensed milk (3.50). Really yummy, fresh bun, but the condensed milk was watered down, so when dipping the bun, the condensed milk dripped everywhere.   We got the savoury soya milk bowl. This one was really good (2.95). Had some slices of dough fritters, pork floss.  Went down really smoothly, and the bowl is pretty big, enough to share for sure!   Onion pancake, this was the most disappointing dish. Not sure what made it taste mediocre, it wasn't too crispy, soggy inside maybe because of the amount of onions in between it was kinda soggy.   Lastly we got braised beef (soya marinated) rice with veggies.  Comes with a soya egg and a bowl of corn soup. The soup wasn't that good, but the rice had a lot of flavour and when mixed together, it was tasty, not too salty.    The prices are very reasonable, and the quality of the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Heard about this resto from my coworker and finally got to try it. I was not disappointed! The food was very good and fresh. The soup dumplings never broke and the soup was very good. Ordered tons of different dishes to try but the ones that stood out for me was the: seafood egg whites, the sticky rice roll, scallop soup dumplings, crab soup dumplings, and the steamed pork and chive dumplings. All the dishes that we ordered were good but those ones were the ones that got me hooked. This is definitely not a cheap place to eat if you are expecting a huge portion of dumplings but it is a great place for fresh delicious dumplings. I cannot wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout the other day.  Had:  Steamed Soup Dumplings w/ Pork Filling (6 for $5.99) - surprisingly good, considering they came in a foil container topped with a cardboard lid. After a 15 minute car ride home, all six were still in pristine condition (meaning the soup in them was still inside of them, and the xiao long baos had not popped). They're quite delicious, and there is quite obviously soup (broth) in them. That being said, I was not sent reeling. I just came back from Shanghai and it's quite hard to compare this to what I had there (in both price and taste). I'm thankful they included the red vinegar dipping sauce with slivers of ginger. Some places do not give you sauces when you order takeout, and that bothers me.  Green Onion Pancake ($3.75) - four decent sized slices. This is the flat kind of green onion pancake, and not the one that is rolled up and looks like a snail. I prefer this flat kind, but this one did not have enough green onions in it. It was crispy though!  Minced Beef Pie (3 for $5.99) - I don't know why my father ordered these, as we have never had them before, but I am quite glad he did. Let me try to describe what minced beef pies are. They have the circumference of a tennis ball, but resemble a flattened, pan-fried steam bun. Upon opening the container, I was quite apprehensive. Pan-fried steam buns tend to be a disappointment because the bun to filling ratio tends to suck. There is usually a whole lot of bun and very little filling. I am glad to say that these had a very good ratio of bun to filling. The bun was not super thin, but it was just enough to hold the filling, and the soupy broth the filling released when cooked. The filling was lovely and savory, and I enjoy finding soupy liquid in all my dumplings (when the soup does not spill out unintentionally), so that broth was a plus. For the price, I don't know if I can justify getting these all the time (I'm cheap), but they're definitely a nice treat.  Stew pork & Preserved Vegetable w/ Steamed Rice (Soup & Marinated Egg Included) ($7.99) - The name is a tad misleading. It's pork belly with preserved veggies (Cantonese Romanization: mui choy kuw yook). There were about four slices of pork belly. I had one. It was not as flavorful as I would have liked, but it was more tender than I am accustomed to having this dish, which is a good thing. Being slightly health-conscious, I remove the fat before eating this kind of pork belly. Unfortunately, this often has the side effect of me eating a very dry piece of pork belly meat. This piece, as mentioned before, did not have that problem. It was not the most succulent piece of pork I've ever had, but it was by no means dry. The preserved veggies were not in the chopped up bits I'm used to. They were slightly larger pieces and resembled actual leafy greens. They were also not as salty as I'm used to. The soup was corn and egg drop. It was decent, but not particularly noteworthy other than that the soup being corn and egg drop, and not the standard pork bone, carrot and turnip soup that usually comes with authentic Chinese takeout was a nice surprise. I cannot comment on the marinated egg, as I believe we have yet to eat it. All in all, if you want what seems like a slightly more health-conscious version of this dish, this is the one for you.  The food here is quite good. I only wish the prices were a tad lower."}
{"text":"I've been there 5-6 times with my family, and have tried most of their dishes. Spacious and nice decor. Most of the dim sum are fresh and delicious. Noodles and rice cake dishes are nice with generous portions too.  Set meals/rice are okay, some of which, such as braised pork belly meals (???), don't have that particular Taiwanese taste (considering it's one of signature dishes of Taiwan)  Stirring fried dishes are 1/3-1/2 more expensive but with relatively smaller portion and quality. So I don't really recommend it. I used to order Sweet & sour prawn and pork chops with sweet & sour sauce together since the Chinese names look different. (???&?????they actually use the same Cantonese style sweet & sour sauces and veg mix, they are jokes for Chinese customers but the western customers might dig it ;) Don't order Black pepper beef, just not worth the price ($15.99)."}
{"text":"I'm always scouting for XLB shops wherever I go -- this is a new one that sprouted up since my last visit to T.O. It's the sister restaurant to the Ding Tai Fung restaurant in First Markham Place (which is not to be confused with the Taiwanese institution Din Tai Fung -- the mother of all XLBs).  Verdict -- not too shabby.  In fact, I like it better than their First Markham Place sibling. They offer both the regular-sized XLBs and the mini ones.  My kids love the latter, but I still prefer the standard size ones as the smaller ones don't seem to be as juicy or meaty.  Also tried their green onion pancakes, wonton soup, red bean bun, stir fried bokchoy and siu mai (yum!).    Service also is a little better here, as with the location and ambiance.  Lots of parking, although it still gets packed.  Come early as its a popular restaurant!"}
{"text":"Popped in this plaza last night looking for a restaurant that had been recommended to us.  We thought this was the place, but found out after, oops wrong one. We didn't give a flying fig. The menu is totally in Chinese, but they have an English one for us mutton chops.  Everything we got was perfectly cooked, totally fresh and juicy where juicy needed to be.  Of course our eyes were way bigger than our bellies and thankfully I have left overs for supper tonight.  A touch more pricey than your standard jam packed run of the mill dim sum spots, but the portions here are bigger the dumplings are bigger, the ingredients are fresher so I'd suffer the extra coin for the taste alone.  They don't have your usual condiments and that's probably because you don't need them.  The first thing we got that I didn't manage to get a pic of cos we ate it so quickly was small dumplings in a spicy sauce, they were so tasty nom nom nom.  We had to leave room for dessert so we opted for the mango pudding.  It was a lovely milky pudding almost panna cotta like, with a mango puree layer over the top, absolutely light and lovely.  I will be back and I'll be bringing more people.  One thing I recommend is bring a fleecy jumper, the AC was on full tilt and it was pretty chilly.  Understandly needed when you have a full house and the steamers are going like ninety, but we got there before the rush, so be warned.  It's nice to explore your neighbourhood and find a treasure.  P.S. there was only two of us, piggy piggy"}
{"text":"Xiao Long Bao--yes, as in the dim sum soup dumplings--sounded like a damn-must-try when I first heard of it in the ongoing search of a good suburban Asian meal. In between the glass wall looking in the kitchen and the flicker of the TV stuck on the fireplace channel at the back, this place is huge, and brimming with staff standing around like soldiers ready to attack with efficient spartan service, like you'd might expect any other Chinese restaurant would.  The restaurant's namesake xiao long baos are definitely tasty, juicy and a must-order. Whatever hype there is of this new Scarborough dim sum place however, it died when you drift beyond the little xiao long bao dumplings. From their fried noodles to noodle soups, almost everything else we had were either a tasteless cold dud, or something that hits the spot on one end (such as texture) but lacks a lot in others. I honestly had better Chinese food even in grimy Chinatown, and the overall food experience at Xiao Long Bao is not a remarkable one that makes me want to drive back here for more and more.  We managed to bore ourselves with approximately $15/person worth of lunch. People can stop complaining about being handed menus in languages they can't read--their menus are now done in bilingual Chinese and English.  {TTC: the 21 or 169 will get'er there. Xiao Long Bao is tucked in in its own building within the Chartwell Shopping Centre complex at the SE corner of Brimley and Huntingwood Dr--and yes, parking can be difficult, especially when competing with traffic for the adjacent Bestco supermarket. Downtown driving has failed to prepare me for this.}"}
{"text":"One of the best hot and sour soup and xiao lung bao!  My only concern is that the ordering sheet does not have English. We've accidentally ordered the wrong item because we checked off the wrong number. They didn't hold us to that item which is great. Service is fast."}
{"text":"Been here a few times after finding out there was finally a place nearby for Shanghai dim sum. The first time I came here, I had noticed the menu was identical to Ding Tai Fung in First Markham Place. I always order the xiao long bao every time I come here and it's delicious!!"}
{"text":"I went here months ago with my family and since it was new we decided to give it a try. The food looked nice. But as soon as we finished eating here 2 of us within a few hours got a little sick. The next morning I thought I had a simple cold. And a few days later after that I started getting progressively worse and worse. In the end it turns out I had pneumonia. It took me a month to recover. I will never ever go here again. I don't know if it was whether the cold food or the hot food since we had both. But I feel terrible for other people who went there the same night as me and could've gotten sick as well. So eat here at your own risk. No restaurant in this day and age and especially in this country should act like this."}
{"text":"Xiao Long Bao - pretty good, thin wrapping but the pork was a bit dry to me   Hot & Sour Soup - the best I've had in GTA. Prominent hot & sour flavors and the texture is on point - not goopy/starchy like other places!  Dumplings in Chili Oil - favorite of the night  Beef Noodles - pretty good noodles and beef, but I think soup could have more flavor.   Sticky rice roll,  Shanghai fried noodle.. all standard  The complimentary mango dessert is more like a white panna cotta pudding with thick mango syrup on top.   Overall decent Shanghai food, on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Since my favorite Chinese restaurant closed (Hi Shanghai) i'm trying to find replacement with similar cuisine. This place has less menu items and compare to Hi Shanghai 4/5, price little bit h. Spicy tendon was good, shu mai same as Xiao Long Bao just shrimp on top, but both taste good. Black peper tendon good. Decore not fancy but restaurant clean and not noisy. Can come back some times."}
{"text":"yeah, ok.  very small portions.  tons of waiting staff on hand.  open kitchen is nice.  they even gave my daughter some dough to play with when we went up to their window.  we had some dumplings and the skin was very thin with lots of proportionate filling.  we also had some noodles in soup with some beef.  the noodles were pretty good.  hand made, you can tell.  i just thought that you did not get a lot of food on your plate for the price you pay.  the food is pretty darn good.  nothing frozen, freshly made."}
{"text":"I was pretty stoked about coming here. I left a tad disappointed.   This place is on the pricier side. I'm talking about relative to other restaurants that do the same thing. The quality of this place compared to other places is on par if not a little worse. This gives me very little incentive to eat here over others.   The service was attentive. Any requests were handled diligently and quickly. Food was served fast and when requested, the bill came quickly too.   In terms of the environment, I feel like this place is too spacious. It gives me an eerie feeling, as if this place just opened and it's not fully furnished yet. I found it more distracting than anything else. If a restaurant is at full capacity, and there're still echoes, there's too much open space.   Food - 7/10 Value - 5/10 Service - 7/10 Environment - 6/10"}
{"text":"The Xiao long bao was great. The bamboo appetizer was great as well. I wouldn't reccomand the crab Xiao long bao as it didn't taste very good, and the pan fried bun thing. The service was okay."}
{"text":"How wouldn't I not order xiao long bao (steamed soup dumpling) in a place called Xiao Long Bao?!  They came in 6 in a bamboo steaming basket.  The thickness of the wrappers were just perfect and kept the soup inside nicely.  My only complaint was that they didn't provide dark vinegar.  Dark vinegar is the perfect match with Shanghai food.  Shanghai fried noodle was a bit oily, and the portion was a bit small. Service is excellent.  The manger, Michelle, told us that they take reservation.  They have a private room with a table for 12 which can be reserved with no minimum charge."}
{"text":"Spacious design, great for family dinner & friends gathering.  Normally you won't find so much room in a Chinese restaurant.  Love the dried scallop xiao long bao, super fresh & juicy!"}
{"text":"Great place to come with family or friends for xiao long baos and chinese comfort food. Definitely order the pork xiao long baos. They are decent in size and filled with delicious hot meat and soup. The pork potstickers are also pretty good. They have that crispy crunchy bottom and soft top, and the meat inside is similar to the XLBs in juiciness and flavor. The shanghai style chow mein and the stir fried rice cake dish are also great fillers.   Usually at these types of Chinese restaurants the go-to dishes are the xiao long bao, the green onion pancakes, and the beef noodle soup. However in my opinion I thought the green onion pancakes at this restaurant were small, had bad texture, and not enough green onions. The beef noodle soup was also lacking in flavor and needed more richness in the broth. But even though the other dishes themselves were subpar, I am giving this place 4 stars because the xiao long baos are absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I love Everything about this place.  It's a fairly large restaurant and it's nice and bright, which you don't get often for a Chinese restaurant. The food is amazing! It tastes like authentic Chinese food I ate in Shanghai.  If you go, go for the mini xiaolongbao!"}
{"text":"Just outstanding.  That's all I have to say.  I don't mean the food but the whole dining experience is possibly the most comfortable of all the Chinese places I've dined in.  I'm not talking about how fancy the food is or the decor, presentation...etc.    Xiao long bao delivers in consistency.  Their food is nothing fancy but all done with care and tasty.  I've now been here more times than I can count and every time is with my daughter (2.5 yrs old) who enjoys playing with the dumpling dough the staff generously provides upon seeing her little nose pressed up against the kitchen glass.    They have a handicap/family washroom with a change table which makes my life a whole lot easier when we're out for a long family dinners.    I will continue to patronize Xiao long bao for their \"right on\" kind of comfortable dining approach."}
{"text":"Ordered:    5 types of xiao long baos; Stewed pork belly; Braised tofu; Gelatinous tendon; Fried tentacles; Steamed chicken; Sweet & sour pork ribs; Onion/chives fried bread; Dan Dan mien (peanuty-version)  Ambiance/washroom:  clean - modern. Prices- reasonable. Taste- very good.  Tip:  Their Dan-Dan noodles don't have meat; other Shanghai restos have a better rendition.  When tipping, ALWAYS base your tip on the SUBTOTAL not on the total (tax included).  I always use \"Other\" rather than the pre-programmed percentages."}
{"text":"Very modern and clean look with an open concept design. Tons of seating and tables spaced apart very well. Ordering is really simple; you just check off what you want on the paper menu they provide. The paper menu was all in Chinese but they do have an actual menu as well with English. We ordered a variety of things to try and all were very good. Everything is made fresh to order.  Steamed pork soup dumplings, aka (xiao long bao) $5.99 for six dumplings. Very soupy inside and these are probably the best pork soup dumplings around.   Fried pork dumplings $5.99 - these come in five dumplings but are much larger. Inside is still soupy but not as much as the xiao long bao. Tasted great but next time I would skip these and just get another order of xiao long bao since I like those better.  Minced beef pie $5.99 - these come in three pieces and are pan fried. The beef inside is not soupy but very juicy.  Soup noodle with spicy and peanut sauce $6.99 - the noodles were cooked a bit on the softer side and the soup was not spicy at all. It just tasted like peanut sauce to me. Still tasted good but I would rather have the ones at 369 Shanghai.  Steam black sesame paste buns $5.99 - these come in six pieces. Inside is sweet black sesame paste and the outside is wrapped in the same casing as the pork soup dumplings. A very good dessert. I could have eaten all six myself :)  Souffle ball stuffed with black sesame paste $7.49 - these come in four pieces. Its basically sweet black sesame paste on the inside with an egg white batter on the outside which is deep fried. The egg white is fluffy, airy and light. It is also topped with powdered sugar. It looked appealing when I saw the picture online but I didn't really enjoy it as much.   The place was super busy but service never really faltered."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  I'm willing to actually say Ding Tai Fung's sister branch is better than Ding Tai Fung themselves.  Xiao Long Bao opened a year or so back, and is a completely open-concept/modernized Ding Tai Fung. The restaurant is also much bigger, so waiting time during peak hours isn't as bad as DTF, where if you don't reserve during peak hours you're likely waiting north of an hour.  I arrived on a Sunday night at 8pm, and the place was 3/4 full, which was about what I expected. The menu is the exact same as Ding Tai Fung, so if you're used to the menu over there it shouldn't take long to determine what you want to order. I had the chicken marinated with wine, steamed soup dumplings with dried scallop, shrimp, and chinese okra (new thing on the menu), steamed soup dumplings with pork, steamed silver roll, minced beef pie, and the sesame paste souffle balls.  I highly recommend you try the new okra soup dumplings, as I believe that one is much better than the regular pork soup dumplings, as you can really feel the dried scallop taste. The chicken marinated with wine is an excellent dish to start as it's served cold and you get that nice alcohol taste. The steamed silver roll (steamed, not deep fried!) is an excellent alternative to white rice, and I definitely suggest ordering the rolls over bowls of white rice. The minced beef pie was extremely juicy, so if you're not a soup dumplings fan but want something juicy, go with the beef pie. The souffle balls, unfortunately, were the worst part of our order, as the sesame paste wasn't runny at all after it cools down; A La Kitchen unfortunately does a better job here.  Service was excellent, much better than Ding Tai Fung I find. Personally I'd save Ding Tai Fung for the tourists who may not know about its sister branch, cause I definitely found this place to be more enjoyable."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant a couple of times. They have some comfortable seat and they have enough spacing between tables to tables.  Tonight, I think their food weren't that consistence. We ordered this noodle soup for the second time. The first time we had, their noodle did it just right but this time it was a bit soft but still taste good.  Today, I think their food were quite salty, and hope next time I try will be better."}
{"text":"Heard this is the sister restaurant of ding tai Fung at fmp, it's pretty big inside, modern with lots of seating....you can see the cooks making the dumplings in the very back...we ordered the XLB $6 for only 6 pieces, kind of pricy and nothing special, also got for stew pork and it was too dam salty....overall this place is pricy and the quality of food is not that great  The original location is better"}
{"text":"I have been craving for Shanghai food for a while so I suggest coming here tonight after hitting the gym. I arrived early and was on the phone while walking inside, the male host/server saw me trying to open the door and he actually came out and opened the door for me. Wow. He promptly seated me near the middle and poured me some hot tea.  So my group of 5 decided to order a few shanghai style dim sum and a few other dishes to balance it out. Ordered the Xiao Long Bao - obviously! It was great, the exterior is really really thin and when you pick it up you can swing it and it won't break. Delicious soupy interior and I didn't even need other condiments as it was already really tasty.   Leek patties were a let down, they forgot our order so we had to wait an extra 10 minutes for them and it came out oily. It also had a very thick exterior and was quite oily. The filling was mediocre, a little boring and bland to be honest.   Friends also ordered a few cold apps that was organs/intestines which I'm not a fan of, according to them it was mediocre and was bland as well. Either it lacked the correct spices or it wasn't sour enough.   The beef noodle soup had a very strong cumin smell to it and I was expecting it to have a strong bold taste, again it was bland.    The snow pea in chicken broth was pretty standard.   Fried Tofu was good, nice crispy exterior and soft on the inside without being too dry or bland. The spicy dipping sauce was way too oily and wasn't spicy enough.   Spicy chicken smelled amazing and I see a lot of chilies so I was expecting a strong flavor, it wasn't that spicy so it was rather meh.  Overall I'm not sure if the chefs were having an off day or if their standard is suppose to be so bland. The food didn't taste bad but it was bland for the most part. The portion to price point is higher compared to the local competition but I do like how clean this place is. I wouldn't mind paying a little bit more for a clean place and good service."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum except I heard the Sio Mais aren't good. The xiao baos are great. The Shanghai rice cakes are bland though and the waiters don't speak or understand a lick of English which is annoying."}
{"text":"Yeey, this place is good. Actually it's a copy of Din Tai Fung. The food is almost as good as in Din Tai Fung but not exactly the same. From my experience, I noticed that XLB dumplings are very thin and fragile, they broke so fast. Vegetarian dumplings were good and delicious. I like that this place is bigger, not so crowded, and it is much easier to find a table; no need to wait for 30 min or more on Friday night. I highly recommend their dumplings and veggie dishes, except the ones with garlic - it was way too much garlic. And most desserts are very oily. Last time we tried Soufflé Balls and Red Bean pancake, and we couldn't even eat half. Soufflé balls were just fried bread that smelled like fish with tiny amount of sesame paste inside, and Red Bean Pancake was too oily and sweet. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Asian Legend had been our go to for years. When my in laws told my husband and me there was a new xiao long bao restaurants they wanted to take us, we were skeptical.   We stuck to ordering all the traditional items we normally would share in Asian Legend. Pork, crabmeat soup dumplings, beef pastry rolls, chive dumplings, string beans, crabmeat in egg white - everything was as tasty as I remembered but much milder in flavor compared to Asian Legend's. Not that we are writing off Asian Legend but family and I personally enjoyed the milder, cleaner taste.   We completed our meal with their sweet black sesame and red bean xiao long baos like the ones my husband and I had in Tin Tai Fong in Taiwan! Light on the dough/skin (much better than tong yuan) - loaded with sesame and red bean paste - they were simply the perfect, bite sized treats!   Our new go to for Shanghainese cuisine? Can't say for certain yet, will definitely return to sample the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"The xiao long Bao here are the best in town. The soup inside the dumping are tasty. The dumping skin itself also very good, not too thin not too thick can hold the soup inside. The mice beef pie which also a surprise, you need to try that out. The braised beef noodle in soup are also very good. The noodle are fresh and bouncy n the beef was very tender.  However the pan fired pork bun was very bad. It had no filling or should say very tiny little stuff in there that can't really taste what was it. also the pan fired pork dumping also disappointed. The pork inside the dumping was tasteless.  Overall the restaurant looks clean n organized. Even though some food are out standing and some are not even restaurant quality, will still come back for their \"xiao long Bao\"."}
{"text":"+ great soup dumplings + courteous staff + large and clean space - a little overpriced  - most non-dumpling dishes were pretty bland  Recommended Dish: Soup Dumplings"}
{"text":"Let's see... where to start.  First off. No Water! Every restaurant I have been in offers water as a basic.  Water was not offered.  No beverage suggestions from waiter.  The menu was in Chinese only. And lucky me, my wife can ready it. I can't read a lick of it.  The staff were more concerned with wiping the place clean then serving.  Really how many times can you wipe a table?  And then they all kinda cluster in the back part of the restaurant from time to time.  Can't seem to get anyone to take our order.  Moving along...  Very hard to get the cheque as well.  I could walk out and come back and they wouldn't notice.  My wife noticed that the other patrons (only 3 other tables) have what appears to be water jugs at their table.  Still waiting to flag someone for the cheque...  Got someone.  Aaargh she doesn't understand English?!  Okay as for the food.  The soup filled dumplings are extremely salty.  Hate to see what the sodium count is.  The other item we ordered was bland at best.  I'm going to try the other place that other members have cited at a later date for comparison."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We come here often, the XLB are fantastic, as is just about everything else on the menu. Ingredients are extremely fresh and high quality. The service is great too! My only tiny complaint is that I wish they were licensed."}
{"text":"Xiaolongbao is very clean for a Chinese restaurant! Very impressed. The food is pretty good too, their xiaolongbao is OK but their choice dumplings are great. Spacious, clean, comfortable, even their washrooms are quite clean, I went on a weekday though around 2 pm so there weren't many people there."}
{"text":"$16 for the Shrimp Fried Rice after tips and tax. There was way too much rice and not enough Shrimp. Tasted not bad but not great either."}
{"text":"Came to this place with a recommendation from a friend to try a new place.  Place is very new and looks big and clean. Love the atmosphere.  Menu seems identical to 369 Shanghai Dumpling at Kennedy & 7 but the food doesn't taste the same.  I would say the dumplings here are average, definitely not the best I've had.   We came on a not so busy time with about 5 tables, but we still had to flag down a waitress because they were busy doing other things...  Probably won't be going the extra mile to visit here again, there are similar and better places in Markham."}
{"text":"By far one of the top Shanghai restaurants I've been to in Toronto, good for large family gatherings, too.  Came here with a family of four on a weekend. It didn't take too long for us to be seated which was good. The place itself was huge; close to the size of a dim sum restaurant. Decor was also quite modern for what you would expect with a Shanghai restaurant. You could also see the kitchen in the back through the glass which was pretty cool to see them cooking and making the dishes.  We ordered the Xiao long bao, 2 different flavours (original pork and crab), followed by the fried rice cake, egg whites with broccoli, sour and spicy soup, noodles in broth with shredded pork and nappa cabbage, plain stir Chinese broccoli, deep fried bun with condensed milk, spicy stir fried pork, deep fried egg whites with red bean and sugar.   The restaurant name itself, their Xiao long bao were definitely good. I preferred the pork over the crab. The inside was very juicy and meat was tender and flavourful. Must try here if you're into this dish. The fried rice cake was nothing out of the ordinary though, a bit greasy actually. Egg whites with broccoli was delicious - broccoli wasn't too raw or overcooked; expect this one to be a bit on the greasy side since egg whites require more oil to cook in order for it to not stick to the pan. Sour and spicy soup wasn't bad either, the sourness and spiciness was pretty balanced. Noodles with shredded pork and nappa cabbage was... what it is. Not much to say there besides a nice clean dish - might be good for vegetarians minus the meat. Chinese broccoli was crisp and fresh. Deep fried bun with condensed milk was simple yet good; the bun wasn't over fried and the center was nice and soft. The stir fried pork was a bit salty, although there were a lot of ingredients in there; would go nicely with plain white rice. Last but not least, dessert - a must order when you go to a Shanghai restaurant is the deep fried egg whites with red bean. They are only good if they come to you hot and these ones did not disappoint. The amount of red bean was not skimpy (some restaurants do because they cheap out) which made it a nice ending to a satisfying meal.  Give this place a try if you're in Scarborough as it's pretty close and accessible."}
{"text":"I came here multiple times and I really enjoy the food here. It's a fairly large restaurant and the place is very clean. When you wait for a table, it usually doesn't take a long time!   The last time I came, I ordered the soup dumplings, hot and sour soup and a few others that I love but that my friends ordered ! See the pictures!   Definitely would recommend it!"}
{"text":"We went on a weekday during dinner time. No wait, a few tables of guests. Food came out pretty fast.   //Menu\\ The paper menu they hand you is entirely in Chinese, but they do have flip menus with the corresponding numbers and titles in English. If you walk in speaking English, they will likely hand it to you. If not, you can ask. Their English is limited, though. So if you're going to order/ask about something, make sure you're both on the same page before the server walks away or you'll end up ordering something you only inquired about.  The menu is like a dim sum menu along with typical Chinese dinner fare. What I thought was weird was that for a place called \"Xiao Long Bao,\" the menu didn't have many xiao long bao to choose from, or maybe I just didn't notice. It could be the Chinese menu lists more than the English judging from Yelp photos. The beef wrap rolls seemed popular. They're sweet stewed beef rolled in a Chinese pancake. The flavor was akin to char siu bao flavor. It was a little too sweet for me, but the kids enjoyed it. If you prefer savory over sweet, don't order it.  //Service|Vibe\\ The space itself is nice, bright, and spacious, although the tables are a little too high for the chairs. It's almost this awkward feeling of being a child sitting at an adult's table. Overall, everything still looks pretty new.  The food is not bad, but the service from the staff can be uncomfortable. At least for us it was, because the staff kept circling over us, always turning the corner at our table and walking very ostensibly by our chairs. It doesn't make for a relaxing meal when you see them do this at two minute intervals and constantly eying you from the server's station in the back. Everyone at our table walked out feeling this way, which negated the actual enjoyment we had from the food. It made the experience itself a 2-star."}
{"text":"Was craving for some xiao long bao. The menu is entirely in Chinese so you may have to ask for translations if you're not fluent (I am not). EDIT: Apparently they have an English menu but I was not privy to this - so ask (I'm used to seeing bilingual menus, like many dim sum places have).   We ordered a ton of food but the xiaolong bao themselves were pretty good. They had lots of soup and didn't break when handling, though the dumpling wrap was thin. Be careful of the direction you bite it as it may explode with hot liquid. This can be a great gastronomic experience or a disaster. They have a display window for you to watch them make it too.  Also, the black sesame tongyuen was delicious. They had a ozmanthus sugar broth with flower petals suspended in it - Really light and refreshing."}
{"text":"Awesome chinease foods?Best tastes of sticky rice dumpling??????and juicy pork dumping????? Service is not good?price is a little bit high."}
{"text":"Service was very good. Place is pretty new open and clean.  Dumpling had good flavour   The noodle was disappointing. They seemed old and not fully cooked   \"Tan tan mian\" traditionally is a spivey noodle soup with ground meat/pork some scallions and group peanuts or peanut paste. This one was not spicy and no ground meat so it was a warm peanut soup with poor noodles.  I guess you can tell which part of the meal I didn't like.  Setting aside quality the prices also seemed a bit higher than average.    A lot of other people seemed happy so for now I will assume it was bad luck."}
{"text":"This place had the most delicious soup dumplings! The soup inside was very flavorful. You could tell everything was made from scratch here because they had so many workers there perfecting their soup dumplings. Must try this place if you are ever around this area. Perfect for this snowy weather."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  Xiao Long Bao??? probably one of my favorite Shanghai Dim Sum.. But I love steamed Chives Dumplings and a lot of other Shanghainese dishes.  Xiao Long Bao Grand Opening today. The menu reminded me of Ding Tai Fung in Markham and Xiao Long Bao is really the sister restaurant of DTF! I am just glad that finally they comes to their senses to open up another branch in Scarborough and have a new name, not trying to pretend to be something else...   The interior is really spacious and the tables are set far apart. There are quite a few tables for big groups!   We shared:  ??? ($5.99) Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings  ????($5.99) Steamed Chive and Pork Dumplings  ????? ($10.99) Fried Shanghai-Style Noodle  ???? ($6.50) Double Boiled Chicken Soup   Everything was tasty and we really enjoyed the friendly service.   The only reason it is not getting a 4 star is maybe the price point to portion. The Shanghai Noodle for $11 was just so small. The portion is half of what I would have get at other restaurants in the area at $9?!  I would be back when I have cravings for soup dumplings when I am in the area. I love the Steamed Chive and Pork Dumplings!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time recently with my family. We came on a Monday afternoon around 2 PM and there was lots of seating available. They do Shanghai-style dim sum here, which is interesting and differs from HK/Cantonese-style dim sum, which I am used to. I had a good experience here, as our food came quite promptly and I thought all of it tasted pretty good. Although we only ordered 5 things for 3 people, it was sufficiently filling because generally each dish is larger than what you would get at a typical dim sum place (i.e. 6 dumplings rather than 3-4). I'm not an expert at all when it comes to Shanghainese food, so it's hard for me to judge the quality or legitimacy of the food... but personally, I did enjoy everything. We tried their xiao long bao (soup dumplings), green onion pancake, some dumplings stuffed with rice, some kind of bun with condensed milk, and a rice roll thing. I would say it's worth a try, just because the food is pretty interesting."}
{"text":"The first impression I have on Xiao Long Bao is the decor is really pretty.  The restaurant looks more like servicing contemporary, fusion cuisine than traditional Chinese food.  Yet the food is most definitely traditional.    We ordered Xiao Long Bao, Sticky Rice Siu Mai, Fish with Wood Ear, Bean Sprouts, Beef Tendon Noodle and Red Bean Sugar Donuts.  I really like the Xiao Long Bao because they had a generous amount of soup.  The skin was thin but it didn't break.  The Sticky Rick Siu Mai was my second favourite because sweet and savory coexisted in the siu mei.  The texture was chewy.  Fish with Wood Ear was standard.  The fish was average fresh.  The Beef Tendon Noodle was forgettable and hardly had any beef tendon in it.  The Red Bean Sugar Donuts (Balls?) were not fluffy enough.  Their presentation was very appetizing, though.  I kept comparing the food here against Asian Legend's.  The xiao long bao here is better than Asian Legend's.  The fish dish, the beef noodle and the sugar dobuts are not as good as Asian Legend's.  I have not eaten siu meis at Asian Legend yet, so I cannot compare.  The overall impression is the decor is nice. The price is comparable to other higher end Northern Chinese food restaurants.  We paid $75+ all in for a dinner for 5 people.  The services is proficient.  Other than xiao long bao, the food is average.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Xiao long bao: 4/5 everything else: 1/5 it was greasy and bland. For the price of everything, totally not worth it unless you're just coming for xlb's."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and quite large. I came here because I wanted my first taste of the famed Xiao Long Bao (soup filled dumplings) and where better to try it then a place named after the very food! I totally get the appeal. Juicy and savory. The xiao long bao here are very good and very satisfying, much more than your average steamed dumpling.   We also had the shanghai style pan fried pork buns which are also really yummy, albeit a bit oily.  Pan fried pork and chive pockets. These are delicious but oily.  Spicy & Sour Soup - The small is perfect for two people who are very hungry. Nothing particularly special.  Everything was seasoned perfectly. Service was a bit brisk and cold but at least food was brought in a timely fashion and the staff was easy enough to wave down.  Overall I really like this place and would come here again, maybe frequently. Definitely want to invite people out to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just as good as DTF. Much more spacious then DTF. That's why i decided to visit here. The beef noodle is the bomb. Even my picky eating 3 yr old eats well here. 10 stars if I could."}
