{"text":"This restaurant is most definitely the most clean of any Chinese restaurant within China town. The service is mediocre like any other restaurant in Chinatown. It's really expensive and the quality of the food is what makes it stand out. I personally enjoy the spring rolls and siumai. All in all, the food is really enjoyable, however and service is lacking."}
{"text":"Went here for dimsum on a week day. Food was standard fare. After trying the whole slew of dimsum places in Chinatown, I'm convinced that all they do is heat up pre-packaged, frozen portions. They all taste the same! Anyway, I don't know if Rol San is one of these places, but the food is nothing spectacular.  After the meal, my head started throbbing like crazy and my mouth was dry. Must have been (surprise surprise!!) a whole lot of MSG in there.   Service was virtually non-existent."}
{"text":"Ever since I was young, my parents would bring my brother and I here to eat dim sum EVERY WEEK. The dim sum dishes are excellent! My favourites are the egg tart, har gow, and deep fried shrimp dumpling with salad dressing! As well as the beef fried noodle. The service is great and friendly. However, the pricing is a bit on the expensive side but I understand since the food is pretty amazing. The restaurant is usually packed so get there early!"}
{"text":"Great place for dim sum in the city! This is a no frills establishment but the food is good and worth the price. Service is fast!  Open late, this is a good spot for a late night meal if you are looking for something better than your average late night eats.  There's a large dining area in the back and different table configurations so it can seat big groups."}
{"text":"Transitional dim sum place, small setup but really popular. When we have family came to visit, we always bring them here to have Chinese comfort food. The only problem is the waiting time, have to arrive early to avoid it. But then some dishes are not available before 11/12."}
{"text":"One of the better dim sum restaurant in Chinatown. The dim sum here is actually quite good, better than what I had expected. Each of the dishes we ordered came out nice and hot. Service here wasn't to bad either, it didn't feel like we were being rushed out like what happens in most Chinese restaurants. I will definitely come back here when I'm craving for dim sum again."}
{"text":"I love dim sum and have eaten it in many cities.  Rol San has amazing dim sum and is definitely worth the trip.  The Har Kow (or shrimp dumplings) is a favorite of mine and many.  It comes out very fresh here and is always tasty and wrapped in a very light rice paper.  The cuttle fish (baby squid in a curry sauce) is yummy and tender, not rubbery.  Usually comes out super hot which is great, as cold cuttle fish is awful.  The steamed barbecue pork buns are tasty little delights, especially when dipped in a combination of the hot chirashi sauce mixed with sweet and sour.  The sticky rice comes in two individually wrapped packages and is just the right consistency of sticking together with a wonderful flavor and almost every package includes a piece of spicy Chinese sausage.  The shu mai is a masterpiece here - you can taste its homemade, bursting with flavor in a very light wrapper and topped with an orange caviar.  The turnip cakes almost always come out hot (if cold, they are gummy) and have small chunks of turnip in them, which I love.  Any of the steamed dumplings I've tried are wonderful - hot and full of flavor.  The greens are amazing, especially those in a black bean sauce.  The atmosphere is okay, the staff is usually helpful, although you come across the server that from time to time is a bit grumpy.  The plastic cloth on the tablecloth must be ignored in favor of the delightful food.  I've eaten at other dim sum places in Chinatown on Spadina and this one is tops.  Would totally recommend as a regular customer.  Really worth it for taste, cost, and overall choice of traditional dim sum dishes."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Rol San, and while some dishes were of consistent quality others were seriously lacking. Recent price increases have the more popular dim sum items like Har Gow and Siu Mai at over $4 per item. These generally only have 4 pieces per container. These probably cost 10 cents each to make so i was feeling a bit ripped off at the lack of value for these. While the taste of the items was excellent the portion sizes were lacking. The meat in the lotus leaf sticky rice was not up to par, but otherwise an okay visit. We got watered down hot mustard and not-sirachi hot sauce...The service was pretty crappy too we were ignored and stared at by staff for the first 5 mins and the waiters were rushing around oblivious to customers almost running right into me as he cut me off on my way back from the washroom."}
{"text":"This place was the one really dependable dim sum house in the city for many years.  Family and friends used to eat here quite often both dine in and take out.  The food was fair tasting and service was fine if you don't arrive during the peak times.  Every changed a number of years back on one particular occasion when we saw the waitress wipe the dirt off her shoes and then wiped the table with the same cloth.  Without trying to stereotype, she was one of those recent immigrants from my home land where such practices are likely normal.  So it came down to two choices here: ignore the fact that these things probably happen at most restaurants and we just don't see them (especially the kitchen) and continue coming here to eat or stop coming cos I can't seem to get that image out of my head.  I choose the latter.  Without getting into too much detail, I'll just say eat here if you can block out what I just told you here or bring your own table cleaning cloth and wipe all your utensils before eating.  I'm not sure if she still works there but I'm not taking any chances. I prefer other finer/cleaner establishments regardless of the price.   3 stars here for the food, price, service and one star for cleanliness."}
{"text":"Like all good Chinese boys from Ottawa, I make my pilgrimage to the T dot for its Chinese food. I chose this spot because the sign in the window said Dim Sum all day!  The dim sum was hot and fresh and the \"zhin dooey\" was very unique, using a sesame paste filling instead of the lotus or red bean paste.   The tea they served was boring pu er (bolay) but I didn't bother to ask for another kind.   Big surprise when came time to pay:  server- \" sorry, no mastacard, only visa or cash\" me- \"do you take debit?\" server- \"only visa o cash\"  That made for an embarrassing evening with my friend"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, got stuffed from the food there. The staffs were okay they weren't that friendly but they are not mean. The mango pudding melted in my mouth and left a sweet mango taste afterwards. The shrimp dumping was scrumptious. I enjoyed every meal at there and it was a very fun time with my mom there:)"}
{"text":"Good place for dim sun on Sunday, but i think they offer dim sun everyday."}
{"text":"My mom and brother came to visit me and we wanted dim sum, so we went to the usual Bright Pearl. However, that place was closed for a private party, and we saw a huge sign in a restaurant across the street advertising all-day dim sum. I am so glad that we went there instead, because it was Rol San. What a pleasant surprise! This is the best dim sum I've had so far.  First of all, as many other reviewers have said, instead of the common dim sum set-up where they bring food around in carts and you take as you wish, you actually get to order what you want and they bring it to you per order. I much prefer this because the food is fresher that way and it's easier to get exactly what you want.   Second, the food was amazing! My favourite kind of dumplings are siu mai and the classic Chinese pot stickers. I have tried both in many, many restaurants before and I have to say these were the freshest and best dumplings I have ever had before. Besides the dumplings, all of the other food was freshly made and delicious. The service was also very non-Chinese friendly, especially for Chinatown.  Finally, the price was very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food and downtown location. The three of us paid $40 for everything, but my brother also eats a lot, i.e. probably more than most normal people.   Suggestions: siu mai, har gow, BBQ pork buns, pan-fried pork dumpling,  beef short ribs, seafood dumplings, sesame rolls, and egg tarts (desserts). There's probably not much you can go wrong with! Enjoy =)"}
{"text":"Normally go here and sit in the very back of the restaurant during dim sum. The back staff is very rude. The older Chinese lady and the younger Chinese guy wearing glasses and with the white shirt.. so fucking rude. Food is okay, but wouldn't go back because of the horrible service."}
{"text":"Rol San..infamous for their dim sum! Havin' eaten dim sum in quite a few restaurants in downtown chinatown, Rol San is one of the cleaner ones. For example having your shrimp deveined in the har gow and the wrapping to be extra sticky is wonderful.  So you miss out with the ladies calling out the dishes, but guess what?? You're dishes will be served piping hot and fresh! Large Pork Siu Mei Dumplings, Deep Fried Shrimp and Chives Cake, a variety of Rice Rolls, and Chicken Feet are mouth watering just to name a few!  A must try!! It's a bonus if you get seated in the back room since it is much more appealing to the eyes! Take a peak even if you don't! Hope you'll all give this place a visit :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum.  Good service.  Good location.  Nothing above average, but pretty decent for what you're paying, especially downtown.  They had a really cute sweet dish of pumpkin fried dumplings.  I would go back again, but probably not order quite so much food."}
{"text":"BEST DIM SUM IN CHINATOWN! I hate the dim sum places that serve by cart. By the time the cart arrives at your table, the food is cold since it's probably been around the whole restaurant TWICE and has been left out too long. Personally, I think it's gross but that's my opinion. At Rol San, every time I order anything from the menu, the food ALWAYS comes out piping hot, that's why I love it here! I guarantee that this is the best place to eat Dim Sum in Chinatown where the food actually has taste and flavour in it for a good price. I've never had any problems with the service; it's so quick that I get my orders instantly! Some of the servers don't speak or understand English but other then that, I would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I liked this place, but it was a bit odd. The peel away table clothes and curt wait staff, put me off a bit. Food was good, not great. I would go back."}
{"text":"OK for dim sum. Terrible for a la carte Chinese food.   Dim sum is decent. A go to for some families I know. Went there once for late night Chinese. Abysmal. Made for gwie lo if you know what I mean and expensive for just terrible Chinese food. You can get much better quality for the same price at Asian Legend and that's saying something.   3 stars for their dim sum. 2 stars or less for their other food."}
{"text":"A lil' disapponted with the food. Was expecting a very gd dim sum after the many days of American food, after reading the reviews.   Fried squid was too tough. Chicken Cheong fun was tough too. BBQ pork buns were not soft and meat was hard.  Overall: Not recommended."}
{"text":"I called Rol San Restaurant to place an order for delivery after researching the net and finding that they offered delivery. The person answering was quite rude: I asked to place an order and he responded by saying \"We don't deliver\".. and then abruptly hung up before I could respond. No apologies, explanation or customer care. Highly dissatisfied with this service. Would NOT visit a restaurant with so little customer care."}
{"text":"Ate here last on December 14th, 2012.  This is a great quality restaurant which serves authentic Chinese cuisine. Was there during lunch hour with a group of peers.  The place was very busy, but we lucked out and got seated right away.  Their dim sums like shrimp dumplings (har gows), sponge cake (ma lai goh); friend shrimp dumpings; friend chicken wings, egg tarts, custard buns, beef ribs, steamed beef balls, etc all taste really good.   Service: Friendly & highly efficient  Parking: Metered street parking available on Spadina Ave."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. It's quite the busy place! The food was good, we were served relatively quickly and it's reasonably priced. One thing - when you ask for water at a table, it usually means the entire table wants it!  How many times do you have to ask for a glass of water? Other than that: the only drawback - they don't accept debit cards. What's up with that?"}
{"text":"I was pretty hesitant going to Rol San, due to the negative reviews they had. However, the service was pretty good; they were fast and efficient. I really enjoyed the food served here, especially the shiu mai. My only complaint is the cleanliness of the table-wear.   Next time, I will bring some wooden chopsticks with me! ;)"}
{"text":"Great dim sum and baos. It's packed in the morning and there's another dining area in the back. Waiters don't speak much engilish and some understood few chinese, needs to point on menu for ordering and have no chance to ask questions. Quick motion in every aspect and not a good choice for relaxing breakfast."}
{"text":"Rol San, let's talk about the service/ambiance/hygiene of the store and the food in two separate parts shall we?  To start off, I'd gladly give 5 stars to the food. Everything here tastes marvellous. The shiu mai, the har gaw, the shrimp rice rolls, the deep fried squid tentacles, in summary, EVERYTHING.  Come at lunch time on the weekends, and you shall see for yourself! The line-up is absolutely massive. I overheard many people in line saying that they were willing to come all the way downtown and wait in line for what is known to be \"The Best Dimsum Place in Downtown.\" I agree with them completely. There is not a single item on the menu that lacks taste! If you like Dimsum for the food itself, you must come here!  The store itself, this is the reason why I took 1 star off the rating. The ambiance has no \"dimsum feel\" to it. No carts pushing around. The store isn't so fancy looking either. The tables are covered with white plastic bags. Although they are quick and convenient for clean-up, they ruin the restaurant atmosphere.   The washroom...let's not go there...  Personally, I don't like the way the restaurant is designed. The front is very small, and the back is huge. However, they seem to be two separate place, and there is, in fact, another line-up at the back.  The service ranges from terrible and decent. The people there don't leave you alone until you tip them, even if you haven't left the restaurant yet. They sometimes forget your requests that don't involve ordering more food (e.g. if you ask for one more bowl), and nothing they do is gentle. They'll slam plates on your table. I don't mind the slamming, but I know many people do, so I'll consider that in my review.   Overall, if you can ignore the service, please come here! The long line-ups prove that it's still worth the time to dine here!"}
{"text":"Yummy dim sum. I don't eat pork but they make their shrimp and veggie dim sum so delicious too. Their fried rice and chicken dishes are delicious too."}
{"text":"The food was terrific (supporting the rave reviews online), with speedy service. All in it was $12 per person and we left stuffed!  If we go again (and that would be awesome) we will make sure to get there even earlier - the line ups are loooong!!  Visited: Feb. 16, 2014  Update: The food was basically as good as we remembered (har gow, sui mai, bbq pork buns, chung fan). Some items were subpar: the squid was rubbery to the point of toughness (and the batter looked to me like it was the wrong type, so it didn't have that light crunchy texture), and the turnip cake was barely touched. We agreed not to order that again at any restaurant. It just never seems to get made in a way we like. We ordered more food than we could consume and left stuffed and happy. All in it was $16/person.  A few dishes were notable: the milk tarts were delicate and flaky; the pumpkin/cashew dessert dumplings were amazing; and the spring rolls were well done, crisp and flaky.  Visited: Jan. 18, 2015"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, and authentic when compared to most of the other places on Spadina. I like their congee with preserved egg and pork (?), and most of their dim sum is fresh and delish.  That being said, I don't foresee myself going back any time soon, because THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!! It is  1) impersonal: a bunch of people, ranging in age / understanding of english / friendliness, all share the entire restaurant. This means you don't get your own waiter, and no one waiter feels the personal responsibility to tend to your need. The waiters come and drop by food without announcing them. At times it's hard to waive anybody down.  2) rude: some of the waiters are not afraid to give out lots of cut eyes, and seem to talk about their guests in front of them (at least those who don't appear to understand the language)  3) incompetent: I've been there twice. The first time, we were given one wrong dim sum dish. When we brought this to the waiter's attention, instead of apologizing and taking it back, he INSISTED THAT WE, THE CUSTOMERS, WERE WRONG. He only took it back after going back to the order station, verifying with the sheet that we ordered dim sum on that it was actually his mistake. No apologies either.... But nothing beats the second time, when we ordered some dim sum and some items off the menu, remembering our experiences from the first time, I wrote down the EXACT NUMBERS for the stuff we wanted off the menu. The older lady who took our order still wanted to confirm them, which was fine by me. I reiterated our orders AND POINTED EACH ONE OUT ON THE MENU. She wrote down some other notes, and guess what? TWO UNEXPECTED DISHES.... When we politely pointed this out to them, she started yelling at the other waiters in cantonese, I don't understand the language but it was pretty clear that it was about us. She then stood there starring us down for a good few minutes while some other waiters brought our food. The most bizarre thing is, she ended up being the one handing us our bill, and she actually SMILED AND SAID THANK YOU.... it really threw us off to be honest, I guess she either wanted a big tip, or, it was a sinister kind of smile that she put on, secretly knowing that she spat in our food....   Anyway, fresh, authentic and delicious food... just don't expect too much from the service."}
{"text":"Must haves:  sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves- aromatic, warm, with chinese sausage and pork in the middle.  Steamed beef short ribs- seasoned with garlic and black pepper.  Garlic lovers must try!  Stuffed eggplant-  the eggplant was cripsy on the outside and tender in the middle.  Great texture.    Skip on: sesame balls- the taro filling was in liquid form, rather than the paste.  steamed beef tripe- pieces were too thick, no flavor.  Service was fine.  Tables had a stack of plastic table covers for easy clean up.  That's fine, and many restaurants do that, but they were stacked so high, everything kept sliding off or shifting."}
{"text":"Large portion on the dim sum, I guess five pieces for two is just good enough. I don't recommend the eggplant because it is too greasy and salty for me, but the tofu and bean curd is really fresh. Like the Chinese dough in rice roll, soft and chewy at the same time."}
{"text":"Food is okay. Service is awful, but it's a no-frills place, so come in with those expectations. The fact that it's open late is a plus, too.   Not enjoyable sober."}
{"text":"Walked in with my family last night for dinner & surprisingly each & every dish that was ordered had a Wow factor. Definitely recommend this place which is right in the heart of Chinatown Toronto."}
{"text":"Dim sum carts seem to be scarce in Toronto and Rol San is no exception.  One of the cheapest dim sum eateries in Chinatown, it can get pretty crowded during lunch, despite having a surprisingly expansive second dining area in back.  The dishes are typical dim sum, nothing too adventurous to see here.  I found most of the steamed items to be quite good (the shrimp in particular), but not extraordinary."}
{"text":"Doesn't even compare to your garden variety Highway 7 dimsum. Was PACKED when I went, but not entirely surprising given the demographics of 'Chinatown'. Better to go for pho!"}
{"text":"The foods are above average and the price is fairly cheap. The service of the waiters are excellent. They constantly refilled our tea. My husband and I had ordered 10 different dim sum for lunch. So yummy. We'll definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"If you're with downtown people who know their shit about Chinese food, you can't take them to just any old MSG joint after a nigh of funneling microbreweries on Queen St. You have to hit u the Rol San where the waiters take no shit and they understand the word \"spicy\" to mean exactly what you said. They also have a pretty good dim sum brunch on the weekend if you don't want to get into the big joints like Bright Pearl."}
{"text":"While Rol San advertises itself as a place for Dim Sum (on a big banner out front, no less), I've exclusively come here for big, heavy meals at 3 in the morning--usually sloshed, tired, and very, very hungry. It's good stuff, the price is right, and it fills you up; it's best to come with a group and split a few dishes for some variety.  The service is pretty typical for old-school Chinese restaurants: lightning fast and nearly invisible (again, perfect for those late-night binges). Though it's not a very big establishment, especially by Chinese dining hall standards, they still have the requisite classy trappings like clean white tablecloths and nice place settings."}
{"text":"The service was horrendous and the food was mediocre. Our waiter was horrible. The way he treated us made us feel like he did not care to serve us for some reason. He was very short when we asked a question, he rushed us through our order and walked away before we could even ask for water and never checked on us if we needed anything else. What a waste of a meal during our only night in Toronto! We stumbled upon Rol San since all of our original choices were closed that night. We did not realize it was a Canadian national holiday on the day we visited Toronto. Lesson learned - when on vacation, check for local holidays that can cause closures!"}
{"text":"Excellent Dim Sum. Service was great. Remember they only take cash or Visa. The steamed pork buns are amazing, the crispy squid and Sui mai were excellent. All in all, great dim sum in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed here, typically go with a party of 5-6, service has always been very quick and dim sum top notch!  Have had to wait in line on occasion over the weekend but this is expected for such a popular place.  Our favorite dim sum resto has always been Golden Court in Markham, but can say that Rol San is definitely comparable and so much closer for us."}
{"text":"I simply just love this place. I have been eating here ever since I was a kid and to this day, they never disappoint. Food is awesome, service is great! A must for people who love dim sum."}
{"text":"It was worth a 15 minute wait. Portions are generous, food is delicious and the service is fast - even though the place is beyond busy. Great choice! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been on the search for some decent traditional dim sum, the kind I had when I was a kid, no frills, no fancy schmancy ingredients, just good ol' dim sum.  Rol San has been a breath of fresh air. It's old school good tasting dim sum (sans dim sum ladies pushing carts around). Still, it brought me back to my childhood of weekend dim sum with my family in a noisy busy Chinese restaurant.    The pork siu mai is very yummy and if you like chicken feet, it's really tasty!  Other favs of ours are pork ribs, beef balls and the toasty milk tarts.   There's a huge sign that says 'all day dim sum' and from what my friends tell me, the dim sum tastes just as good at 2:30am after a night out. Go give it a try! :)"}
{"text":"I love dim sum, I went this place many times. but never go weekday.  Weekend  dim sum is fresher. couple of time weekday dim sums were not so good. However this dim sum place is my fav in Toronto"}
{"text":"Never again.  The service was practically non-existent and our server was extremely rude.  The food was pretty good but I have had better at much lower prices. The atmosphere was average but the plastic tablecloths were a bit of a turn off.  Overall the restaurant appeared clean (not much in the way of decor) but the service was very slow considering there were not many patrons in the restaurant. The bill came to us written entirely in another language with no price breakdown. When we asked for a  breakdown they simply pointed at the total. It was clear that they charged whatever they felt like charging us in hopes of gaining some extra income. Having tallied the items in our heads (based on the prices on the menu) we realized we were overcharged by around $20.00.  Deciding not to create a scene, we paid our bill but left a marginal tip. Our server became very aggressive when he saw what we had left and physically pushed me aside to start clearing the table.  Inexcusable behavior!  The place should be shut down."}
{"text":"I had the all day dim sum.  This place is cleaner and has brighter lighting than most of the other Chinese establishments in the area.  Food tastes fresh, and you can tell things were made in-house, rather than heating up some stuff they got from some vendor. Every item was tasty. Very flavourful, to the point of being a bit too salty and sweet, and some items oily (like any other dimsum place), but no unpleasant after-taste at all, so it is all enjoyable and good indulgence.   It did not knock my socks off, and it is a little higher priced than other dim sum places, but it is definitely worth the price, because food and atmosphere is better. Service was also good. Tea was refilled quickly, and food came at a reasonable time. This is not a cart-dimsum place. You fill your order out on a sheet and they bring it to your table, which I like. Also, they take credit here!  This will be my go-to place for dimsum in the area."}
{"text":"This post is a must... I feel compelled to warn you of the following:  For all those old skool Rol-San lovers who went there back in the days for the Szechuan chicken, chicken corn soup, KCUTSA discount, and lighting fast service... Sadly it no longer exists. I came out of there so angry and still hungry and told our server blantantly that the food taste like shit and that I'm never coming back. So save yourself the thought of a nostalgic stroll down memory lane and avoid this place. New owners and new servers have driven this great past time into the gutter."}
{"text":"Ended up at this cute little dim sum place after finding that the pearl place across the street was mysteriously closed.  Well, we are so glad to have found it!  Was bummed that they don't have rolling carts, but they did have all of my favorites, made fresh to order. Everything was good and oh so cheap.  Would highly recommend and definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Getting a table here was quite an ordeal (at 3 o'clock on a Sunday, too -- not exactly what I'd call a lunch rush) & apart from handing us the dim sum menu, no one ever actually asked us what we wanted (tea was provided so drink-wise this wasn't a big deal, but my lemon tart hopes were somewhat dashed when we were unceremoniously handed the bill).   Overall, though, my complaints pale in comparison to the deliciousness of the food. I'd definitely go there again -- it was worth the wait & the slight disappointments."}
{"text":"The best dim sum I ever had. We were on vacation and I must say that everything we ate at this place was excellent. Everything was freshly made and the rice rolls and shu mai are a must try if you love dim sum. The only draw back is the line is long but it's worth the wait for good food. You will not be disappointed with the dim sum they offer."}
{"text":"Did you know you can make reservations here?  THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.  The food is on par with what you can find at other downtown dim sum places--sticklers may feel like it's not as good as what you can get in Markham/Agincourt, but it's still very tasty AND it's TTC-accessible.  Order the squid.  It's so worth it.  The one thing I don't like about the non-cart places is it's really easy to over-order when faced with a giant list of food, and we totally did.  I will never learn.  I ended up losing the bag with the leftovers while I was shopping on Queen later that day and I am still kind of embarrassed about probably leaving my greasy yummy takeout in some fancypants shop."}
{"text":"Gotta love the Dim Sum and Rol San makes some really good Dim Sum. I went with a group of 8 and we thoroughly enjoyed the variety and quality at Rol San. The dumplings were all fresh, and large, and were all really delicious.  I'm a huge fan of all Dim Sum with the exception of perhaps tripe, and the selection at Rol San is decent considering they are open until 4am.  I know there are better places to get Dim Sum, even in the GTA, but I haven't been to those places yet. I had real Dim Sum at Canton Dim Sum and Seafood in San Francisco, and the cart ladies totally made that visit, sum of the parts you see.  But it's nice to know I can get good Dim Sum whenever I want here at home too."}
{"text":"Came in for dim sum on a Sunday morning. Was quickly seated, ordered, and shortly after... the food came out hot and fresh. The restaurant was clean and bright, and we didn't feel rushed out the door. Do note that the Dim Sum at Rol San is standard typical. Limited menu with the staples / about 30 greatest hits of Dim Sum.  Its not chef inspired or elaborate. However, it is not greasy, the food is fresh, and they use lots of meat in their recipe/ don't cut corners.. For example when eating a BBQ bun or Spare Ribs, some places use a small amount of meat or super fatty portions of meat, but not Rol San. Same with Sui Mei caviar topping. Its not the cheapest Dim Sum in town, but you do get what you pay for. And its also available all day. So if your are craving a serving a lotus leaf sticky rice head in!"}
{"text":"My friend brought me there for the first time, quite a few people were waiting on line. The food is good. Service is okay. Food selection is not as much as some other dim sum places. My friend said the quantity of some dishes are getting less and less....:(....not sure about that....will go back for one or two times with my family to test more."}
{"text":"This restaurant is good for quick meal.  Each DIM SUM is very cheap, so you can try variety of menu if you are more than 2 people.  always quick serve and very hot. however, nothing special, not bad but also I was not able to find out my own best DIM SUM menu. (Of course I have not eaten all menu yet.)  Table are not crowded together like other Chinese restaurant. It is interesting to note that, table covers are just white plastic sheets which are layered many over. but actually its very practical way because I hate greasy and stinky restaurant table."}
{"text":"Nice they serve dim sum all day but the dim sum is sub par. Pretty heavy on the grease which sits like a brick in your stomach. So much hype for this restaurant so it's always pretty busy and lots of line ups. Been pretty lucky, never had to wait for a table. But don't think we would if there was a line up. Anyways, give it a shot, never hurts to try new places."}
{"text":"Gave us tea that we didn't order, and charged us for the tea. I complained, and got told that it is on their menu that they will give customers tea, and charge for it. Strike 1. Received wrong amount of bill like everyone else below. Strike 2. I had nothing but Rol San food on that day, and when I got home, I was in food poisoning. Strike 3. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I've been to this place for dim sum on a weekend and after clubbing on a Friday night.  The dim sum is ok.  I've had better uptown but by downtown standards, its totally adequate.  The worst thing about this place is that as you walk in, there is no numbering system while you wait. The guy who is the host just eyeballs you and you hope that he remembers the order when people came in.  There is also a back section that i've never been to but the line up system at the back is equally as confusing.  The service is fast and the staff is typical for Chinatown. They take your order without too much small talk.  When i asked questions about some of the dishes (since my chinese is not fluent nor can i read every character), they are patient and polite in trying to respond in english eventhough it is clearly not their first language.  The nightime menu items are pretty decent.  I would not recommend the striploin beef ribs there.  It is tough, chewy, and does not taste great.  The cantonese chow mein or chicken/salty fish fried rice are good.  The food comes fairly quickly.  Overall this place is decent and probably one of the better places in Chinatown which doesn't say much.    The bathroom is as good as it can be in Chinatown. The ambiance is not exactly 5 star with all the noisy hustle bustle & loud talking but the place is clean (or as clean as it can be for Chinatown)."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum! I usually go in Scarborough where the price and quality is amazing and I've also had dim sum several times in Hong Kong so my standards have become rather high.  This place was pretty good quality and experience overall for my first dimsum in downtown Toronto. I still miss the actual rolling carts and am not the biggest fan of the order card system. Their speed of service does not really help things."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place for dim sum, a little pricey but it just tastes real good. Line up could be longer than your patience allow, go early, or go to the back room with separate lines, or else go grab Kinton Ramen instead. I personally love the tripe, beef ball and fried chicken wing."}
{"text":"The most striking feature? Everything runs incredibly quickly here.  I was seated, ordered, received tea and water, and received my food in less than five minutes, seriously.  I'll reiterate that the food is yummy. And the tables are clean! That's the magic of disposable plastic table\"cloths\", I guess. And while the portions are a bit smaller than average, but the prices are accordingly lower ($3.28 for shrimp dumplings!)  Even though it was busy, I never felt rushed - I only noticed afterwards the huge room in the back.  $9 for one person, yum."}
{"text":"i've been to rol san before, a LONG time ago and i thought the dim sum was alright back then.  decided to come back one saturday morning since i was in the neighbourhood.  ordered three dim sum dishes - rice roll with barbecue pork, pork dumpling, and siu mi.  the food was awful.  i couldn't believe how bad it was.  it was worse then bad.  i barely touched the food, paid the bill, and just left.  the siu mi looked and tasted like congealed meat.  the glutinous rice wrap on the pork dumpling was too thick and did not taste good.  i don't expect rol san to have the best dim sum but at least be edible and decent.  The best dim sum is out in markham and i guess i'll just stick with going up until they open up some decent dim sum restaurants downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and yum-filled.  Also, slow, rude and forgetful.   A reasonable trade-off? I haven't decided yet."}
{"text":"They serve dim sum all day, so if you're looking for a dim sum fix go here. The dim sum arrives hot and pretty good quality. We went on a holiday Monday at 2pm and it was still very busy. Very good taste in comparison to any of the SF Bay Area or NY Chinatown dim sum places I've been to recently. Their noodle dishes were really good too. Table neighbor ordered a Seafood Fried Noodle dish and it smelled so good and the seafood were so big we got tempted to order that dish to go for dinner later. It was still good reheated for dinner that night.  Good casual place for dim sum in Toronto. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum, pretty mediocre service and atmosphere, pretty average prices. Get there early to avoid the crowds because both service and food go downhill the busier they are; 10:30 on a Saturday was a perfect time for us. I like the food and go here quite often because it's central. Oh, and the custard buns - SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Garbage bags for table cloths? Dim sum was ok. One star for the mosquito floating in my order of tripe. The cleanliness of this restaurant is questionable indeed."}
{"text":"I came to Roi San because of the good reviews here for \"all day dim sum.\" I loooove my dim sum. The hao gao here WAS really good, tofu/shrimp thing was really delicious too, and the mango seafood deep fried triangles were alright. Service was a little slow but food was hot, fresh and yummy... I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"A change from the roll carts, this dim sum place has you ordering your food from a bilingual order form.  On the plus side the food always arrives fresh and hot from the kitchen and it's never sold out by the time it gets to you.  Three minuses: some prefer the 'experience' of the dim sum ladies barking out the food that they're pushing; for the inexperienced dim sum lovers there's no peaking at the food before ordering it; and you have to make sure they give you all the food you've ordered.  Th last one is huge.  We had a total of 3 missing items (which they counted as filled) and 1 surprise dish that showed up and devoured before anybody noticed it wasn't one of the ones we ordered.  If I hadn't kept an eagle eye on what we were getting, we'd be short changed about $10 (offset by, say, $3.50 for the surprise item).  Pretty hefty and led me to knocking off one star.  After all, how enjoyable is the meal if one has to keep track of all the food?  Boo-urns to that.  The food itself was decent, the har gow, shui mai, sticky rice, beef tripe, spare ribs in black bean sauce, mango pudding, etc and the standard dim sum fare were all tasty and piping hot, which almost compensated for the missing food.  Almost."}
{"text":"Just average (or a little below). I was expecting Toronto (Canada in general) to have a great dim sum offering what with a strong Cantonese population. I've had better in LA. Pricing is higher than LA, too, in my experience.   Oh, I will say in their favor that their siu mai is authentic and moist unlike recent icky versions."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my dim sum here.  Very fast; as always.  The food is delicious and the service fast.  Not sure what else you need.  It's not fancy but the prices are reasonable.  Would recommend and return."}
{"text":"Rol San has been our default Toronto dim sum spot for a while now because they consistently provide quality food at a good price.  There is usually a line-up on the weekend, but it moves pretty quickly. It doesn't look that big from the front door, but they have a back section that's even larger than the front. Note that there are lines at both sections, but your technically not supposed to go to the line at the back room unless they send you there.  Once seated at one of the large round tables with your big group, go nuts ordering as much as you want because the bill will end up being reasonable. Last time I went with 5 friends and we had to pay $15 each with tax and tip.  Order the favourites like shiu mai, har gao, steamed pork buns, and dumplings. But also experiment with tripe, chicken feet, and other unique options. I also recommend the taro dumpling filled with beef & shrimp - it's in the dessert section. Delicious."}
{"text":"Good ol' Rol San, it's been an Toronto institution since I've first visited this city. Whether it's an early morning dim sum or a late night snack this place is always consistent for Cantonese style Chinese food. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Good variety and quality of dim sum. Excellent choice of non-dim sum options also, which were served in huge portions. Extensive and very tempting specials.  Nice spacious interior which was much more inviting than many other competitors in Chinatown. Service was good and prices very reasonable.  Will be back."}
{"text":"WOOO I love this place  This is my go-to Dim Sum spot every time I'm craving it. It never fails me! You don't go here for the service and I wouldn't expect it to be amazing because this restaurant is always busy with every table filled and a few waiters.  I always make sure to get har gow!!!"}
{"text":"Last year, I moved from LA to Buffalo and have been desperate for some good, authentic dim sum. When a friend took us to Rol San, I thought my prayers had been answered! The food was delicious and well worth the drive to Toronto. That was during the summer. Today I went back and my experience was not nearly as promising. :(   I'll start with the positives: The pea pod leaves with garlic were tender and flavorful, the Buddha's feast wrapped in rice noodle was cooked perfectly and had an amazing dipping sauce, and the sesame sweet bean balls were light, crunchy and not greasy.   The negatives: The deep fried squid tentacles were shockingly tough ( I thought my jaw was going to wear out), the turnip cake was bland and chalky- maybe it was the high flour to turnip ratio. The meatballs had a strange lumpy consistency and odd taste, and the fried noodles with vegetables and chicken (chow mein) were a bit soggy and underwhelming. Next time I'll either order with caution, or continue my search for a consistently good dim sum restaurant. I welcome recommendations."}
{"text":"For dim sum downtown, it is a decent choice, far better than Bright Pearl across the street. This is our default choice for Sunday mornings, because of course we can't afford Lai Wah Heen. Everything tastes like it should for Cantonese dim sum; not better and not worse.  For non-dim sum, I am a bit baffled by the raves this place gets by my co-workers, who admittedly may be more into Chinese-Canadian than Chinese. Much better Chinese food can be had a few doors north at New Sky. I'm not sure if they are open to serve the post-bar crowd however."}
{"text":"Every restaurant in Chinatown offers dim sum, but this one seems to be a very popular choice. I can see why though - the place looks much cleaner compared to the others and the food I must say is very tasty. It's a very packed place, so I can see that being the reason why the service is a tad slower as well.   Why am I giving this place only 2 stars? Service....the waiters/waitresses are TERRIBLE - especially if you are students; do calculate your bill yourself before paying! When we got our bill, it was much higher than we originally calculated before ordering. My group of friends and I recalculated everything and found that they were overcharging us! When we told the waitress that there's an error on our bill, she quickly snapped back at us! She told us that we calculated it wrong and the number that she put on our bill is correct. She kept saying that we are uneducated students and that we shouldn't blame the waitresses for miscalculating the bill. She kept yelling at us about how students never pay fully and on and on. My friend, unfortunately, snapped back at her and it became a typical asian argument in the middle of the busy restaurant. We all just couldn't believe the women was actually yelling at the customers and isn't even considering about recalculating the bill to confirm with us. In the end, we did recalculate the bill in front of her and found out that they did in fact overcharged us! They even charged us for the tea and each time we asked for a refill ($3 each pot!!!) - this is the first time I ever heard of chinatown charging us for tea during a meal!!! They also add in tips into your bill if you are students and they won't tell you, so if we didn't double check, we would have been paying double tips! After the whole argument, the waitress finally recalculated our bill to the correct amount.  What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a little baby. I am now 23. I come every week or every two weeks and usually order the dimsum. BEST DIMSUM IN TORONTO. It is fast, tasty and fresh!!!!! Hot cooked food at your service. LOVE IT!!!!!!!!   Seriously you need to try this place out....  The Regular menu is good aswell!  It isn't the best costumer service, but the food is so good that I don't even care LOL!!!  Seriously if you love good Chinese food and dimsum please come here :D"}
{"text":"Good place for dim sum around downtown location. Limited selection but the food is good! Line up can be a bit long during the weekend lunch hours. But it's all day dim sum so if you are having a late lunch during the weekend, it works out well. I went around 3pm sunday and there was no line :)"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for dim sum and this place hits all the right places. No, the service isn't fantastic, but what's dim sum without a sassy waiter? Have you never been to the places with the carts? Cart ladies always have attitude. However, they can be forgiven as they fling baskets of shrimp dumpling gems across the table, and the cart-less staff do the same here. Rice rolls forever!"}
{"text":"15 years ago this way my favorite place in China town. After returning to Toronto, I was VERY disappointed at how the level of service has declined to unbearable. I am not expecting white linen service in China town but overtly rude and screwing up our order more than once, I'm out! The quality of food has declined over the years and in my opinion there are much better places to spend hard earned money and not be treated like cattle."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and the food is pretty good. The only thing that wont have me coming back this time is their horrible service. The waitress we got was impatient, rude, sarcastic, and just a horrible server. Our food took forever to come out and came out of order. She only spoke in Chinese and even gave us our bill in Chinese and when we asked her for a bill in english so we could see what we were being charged for she made a huge fuss about it and took forever to bring us another copy. When she did she over charged us 95 dollars for things we didn't even order. She insisted we did order.  At that point we paid the RIGHT amount and left. as we got up to go she demanded a tip. She actually DEMANDED we tip her.  I don't tip unless I feel like I should. And in this case i definetly did not feel like tipping her."}
{"text":"This place has the best dim sum I've eaten in Toronto so far. I'm from Vancouver, and I've always found the Vancouver Chinese restaurants to be much better in general (but Toronto does have some pretty good ones too, you just have to go and find them!). I've really had a tough time finding good dim sum in Toronto, but I think this is a place to go to. They even have all-day dim sum for those who want it late at night.  There was a line up that was close to going out the door. My mom, aunt, and I had to wait for maybe 10-15 minutes before we got a table. We were given a sheet with a list of dim sum items, checked off what we wanted to try, and gave it to the waiter. Within minutes we got our food. - My guess is that they have people making this stuff all day and it's ready to go once someone orders it. I must say, the dumplings we got were some of the best dumplings I've ever had. My mom and aunt ordered a huge assortment of dumplings, all of which were all fantastic; in particular I loved the vegetable-filled dumplings.  The staff are so busy. They were just going, going, going non-stop. No one was really a waiter or waitress, just a server of the dim sum. We had trouble getting someone's attention when we wanted to get something to drink or when we wanted to pay. I swear these workers were practically speed-walking to the tables to hand out the food, go back to the kitchen, and then do it all again. They were all extremely efficient when it came to getting famished diners out and the next batch of hungry diners in.  I'll be back here again the next time I'm craving dim sum. I'd recommend this place to anyone wanting delicious dim sum or are coming to Chinatown."}
{"text":"Four stars for the dim sum food. Very authentic style dim sum. Comes hot out of the oven. Long waits at peak hours. Har gao was notable. The decor and set up is nothing to be desired. Plastic table \"cloth\" greets you when you sit down. The green walls and signage doesn't cry good taste, but thankfully the food does that well for Rol San."}
{"text":"ONLY the dim sum is good here, the a la carte menu items are terrible, I have tried a few times and regretted it each time, so now I only come here for dim sum and nothing else. Four stars for dim sum only, zero for a la carte food (it is greasy and off flavored and just gross).   The dim sum here is reasonably priced and good, it comes out pipping hot which is a plus for me. You can usually be stuffed for about $ 15 per person.  The food is fresh and generous in portion size and is clean.   During the weekdays you can get a seat whenever without a wait since they serve dim sum all day, every day! However, during the weekends during brunch expect a 30mins to 1 hour wait, and you can't really leave to come back, since they call out a number that you are assigned, and if you aren't there they skip you."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with two other friends today and ordered a reasonable amount of food. It was a bit greasy but overall I had no issues with the food. I personally prefer Sky Dragon because they have the carts and you can see what you want to eat. I am not of Chinese background so I am not always familiar with going by just the name and descriptions. Neither were my two friends.   The reason I am giving it two stars is because they OVERCHARGED us rounding our total amount to 70 dollars flat. That seemed  odd to my friends so both recalculated and found out we actually only owed 65.30. They also charged us for tea 60 cents BY THE CUP which is pretty ridiculous.  Tea is usually complimentary. They weren't rude and when we pointed out the mistake they didn't fight us. We decided to tip them poorly according to the fact they were almost about to get more than they deserved and I'm sure they've gotten more from other customers who didn't bother to check their checks before paying. PLEASE RECALCULATE YOUR BILL before paying. They seem to like to overcharge by 5-10 dollars."}
{"text":"Rol San is cheap eats. The decor leaves a little to be desired with the plastic table cloths and cheesy posters on the wall, the truth is you don't come here for the atmosphere. It's cheap, it's good and if you don't get there early on a Sunday morning you will wait for an hour.  While you can order regular Chinese fare here, I wouldn't bother.  Where they really shine at is \"Dim Sum\" or \"Yum Cha\".  Dim Sum is like Chinese Tapas.  The nice thing about dim sum at Rol San is you order it, it comes; unlike traditional dim sum where the staff wheel around cart and you pick things off. The dishes are small but plentiful and with the large menu there is something for everyone. The secret to Dim Sum is to go with as large of a group as you can, the more people the cheap it gets and the more dishes you can try.  For the hard-core there are items like chicken's feet and ox tail but the tamer there is shrimp dumplings and xaio-mai.  I recommend the squid tentacles, lotus leaf rice and mango pudding (my 3 musts for any Dim Sum visit). The squid should be golden and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The lotus leaf has rice, meat and a quails egg inside and should be steaming and fragrant. The mango pudding has chunks of real mango and evaporated milk on top. You should order it last though otherwise it sits there as dessert until you finish the rest."}
{"text":"Rol San is absolute mayham on a Sunday at noon. Ladies wielding bamboo steamers navigate through the tables and the hungry patrons standing and waiting for tables. Standing, in the middle of the restaurant. Really.   The SO and I managed to score a table after a 20 min or so wait.   We sampled shrimp dumplings, some shrimp and pork, the eggplant with shrimp paste, assorted veggie dumplings, the steamed egg custard and bean curd, sticky rice, fried pork dumplings, tofu with shrimp, squid tentacles and tea. To be honest I was really disappointed that we did not go to Markham. The dim sum was really \"meh\" - with the veggie options being particularly sub par. The squid tentacles were the standout.  Food came fast, but it was also on the pricier side. I was full, definitely, but not really impressed.   And GOD I hate plastic table covers. If you are stuck downtown and need your fix, its alright. Not at all worth the wait however."}
{"text":"My friends told me it's good. I disagreed. Ok food. Bad service. Not going back."}
{"text":"While in Toronto last week we asked our tour guide if he had a recommendation for a good Dim Sum place in the Chinatown area and he said Rol San was the best.  We went slightly before dinner time so we could avoid the lines.  The place is VERY unassuming but the food was decent.  I am not a big Dim Sum person, I enjoy Dim Sum, but I don't go out of my way to have it regularly, but I did enjoy the Dim Sum we had that evening.  My favorite dish was the deep fried shrimp and scallions.  They were terrific!  When you sit down they give you a little paper to write down what Dim Sum you want.  You can also order al a carte (instead of or in addition to).  We ordered several options.  I wish was had asked what was in everything, the descriptions on the menu were minimal and when I got one of the dishes I noticed there was meat in it (I don't eat meat, so that was an issue).  I tried to send the dish back but the language barrier was so great that the waitress didn't know what I was asking.  The service was slow, I'm not sure if that is cultural.  Being American I'm used to fast service and a waiter urging me to finish and get the heck out, so I perceived the service to be slow.  They were not quick to fill my water glass which was a problem when I mistakenly added a TON of hot sauce to my vegetable dumpling thinking it was much milder than it was, and my mouth was ON FIRE!    Overall it was OK, but I wouldn't say it was much better than that."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food.  Usually come here once a year with a bunch of girls and we have a waiter named Jason every time.  Always good fresh fast food service is excellent just love it.  The prices are amazing"}
{"text":"Late night dim sum - check   Taste nothing like it should  - check  It's a convenient location to meetup with friends at dimsum and it's open late too. But the grade of the food is just barely passable. Suppose they can get away with serving this slop to the folk downtown, but the uptowners Markham and Richmond Hill folk or out of towners from Cali/Vancouver will just cry. It's so bad.   If it were a toss up of this and a big mac. This would win because there is no McD nearby."}
{"text":"Dim sum is as good as it gets and still great after hours! Beats uptown dim sum! The service isn't great, typical Chinese restaurant service. Other dishes are not so greats. Stick with dim sum when visiting."}
{"text":"Very good dim sum restaurant.  My friend has been a regular for 17 years.  We had a wide range of items and all were very good.  The service is no-nonsense but decent.  Prices were typical for Toronto Chinese food."}
{"text":"Finally had my chance to take in some Downtown Chinatown dim sum and I was definitely impressed. The quality of the dim sum is comparable to the places in markham.   The har gow (shrimp dumplings) were juicy yet did not fall apart half way through eating as so many places suffer from this issue. I recommend that the bamboo and black fungus, fried tofu with shrimp, and the fried eggplant with shrimp paste are ordered.   Their only lackluster dishes were the soup dumpling and the fried dumpling.  I would come again but considering the mid range pricing it isn't an everyday place for me."}
{"text":"I'm not big on Dim Sum at all, but this place is pretty good at it, as far as I can tell.  I dunno.  I prefer the carts.  I'm writing this review because, as Blue B. said, they will rip you off if they can.  $5-$10 per visit sounds about right.  I wish Blue B. had said it without using racial slurs, though."}
{"text":"A middle of the road Dim Sum experience at best. I really can't believe the hype over this place and the NOW mag Best Dim Dum award just makes me scratch my head.   Found the Har Gow wrapping and the rice rolls to be far too doughy to be considered decent. The Dim Sum here is also far greasier than most other places and eating here left me with an intense desire to just go home and crawl into bed and sleep it off.   Also the large pile of full garbage bags and the mountains of dirty dishes left to rot in the busy hallway and waiting area between the two dining areas was quite the appetite turn off. Seriously who piles the garbage in plain view of diners who are eating?  Pro tip: Bring cash. Debit was not accepted when I was there and no one had cash so I had to walk all the way to Dundas just to find an ATM."}
{"text":"During our recent Toronto visit,  we were treated a place which advertises itself as an all day dim sum restaurant.  During our Sunday luncy, this place was pretty packed at 1pm. Overall,  everything which we ordered were good. Service was efficient.  The only thing I have to complain about would be the restroom needed to be attended better by the restaurant staff."}
{"text":"Rol San is my go-to place for dim sum in Chinatown.  Love the order from the card menu when I'm hungry and don't want the push-cart experience. Plus they serve dim sum all day.  Dim sum for dinner is absolutely divine at times when the cravings hit (no I'm not pregnant, but do get food cravings from time to time).  Prices may seem a little higher than other places in Chinatown, but food quality is good as the food served is always hot and fresh and very flavourful.  Service is friendly, fast and efficient.  Plus being a regular customer, I always get acknowledged promptly, but I still would have to wait for a table like all customers, so they're quite fair on the first come first serve policy.  And when it's busy they would ask if customers mind sharing tables which makes for an interesting dining experience and I'm totally in favour of that.  I had some fascinating conversations while seated with complete strangers.  Only one occasion so far that I dined alone which was a first at Rol San for me and the server was quite surprised as he thought I was ordering take-out, but still treated me like usual in his friendly manner.  I think the fact I can speak Cantonese is always helpful and they're not judging at all, but treat everyone equally.  You know the place is good when there's always a line-up and on weekends if you're not there by 10:30am, expect a long wait for dim sum service."}
{"text":"Never had I ever given a restaurant one star nor tip zero, but this one definitely deserved nothing more than a star with its crappy service and terrible food.  Went there in the midday to grab lunch with my friend. It was not even half packed by the time we arrived. One of the dish we ordered was a crab and pork dumpling in soup as shown in the pic below.   The wrap of the dumpling was broken into pieces and the pork that's supposed to be wrapped inside the dumpling was basically floating around in the soup. Thus, we politely asked a server if they can possibly serve up another unbroken one for us, but then she was like:\"All of them should be broken like this cuz otherwise the pork wouldn't be fully cooked.\" Which is apparently a ridiculously unreasonable excuse. So we asked to talk to their manager, and this is where she started to act so rude and literally *yelled* at me and my friend and be like:\"THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD CHANGE IT FOR YOU, EAT IT OR GO!\"(I wish I had a record of this as a proof but unfortunately I didn't and she's speaking in mandarin so yea :(... ).  Trying to prove that she was just making up excuse, we actually did found a pic of the dumpling uploaded by other customer on Google (actually many more out there on other review platform), which is perfectly wrapped up as a dumpling. (PC: Dan Hsieh)  Def won't go there again after been thru this whole unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Waited 45 mins on our 3 pcs dimsum. A white couple just walk in got their fried rice and general Tao chicken and hot and sour  after sitting for only 10 mins. We felt discriminated. Finally got one of the dimsum after 45 mins. And found out that we got charged for the tea that they served without even asking us if we want it since they are charging. Got 3 pcs of  dimsum cost 2.88 plus tea and tax for $4.60!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for fast, late night Chinese food this is the top option. I've been going here for 15 years and it never disappoints... it is better with the addition of Dim Sum. Great late night order. Crispy Ginger Beef, Shanghai Style Thick Noodles, Calamari ... then sleep"}
{"text":"Reasonable priced. Fresh baby squid seasoned with curry. Famous shrimp dumpling. Might be the only place that is so popular and always has a long waiting line. But quite worthy of waiting for!"}
{"text":"This place had quite a line when we got there= the start of a good sign. Things got better when we saw how remarkably fast the line was moving. I must say, you don't go to Asian restaurants in AsiaTown for small talk/ butter you up kind of service, you go for the quality and authenticity of the food. The most popular and common dim sum such as xia mai (sp?)- yellow casing with little orange balls on top and the clear wrapped shrimp dim sum were good. The steamed pork buns were also good. Not impressive compared to other dim sum restaurants but their crispy taro was delicious! Unlike most places that consist of mainly a paste inside, Rol San's had larger, noticeable chunks of meats and vegetables inside! Dim sum is always better with a table of about 4 so you can order more but yet try everything. It was only 2 of us, so we didn't sample as much as we normally do, but the quality and freshness of everything was great. Service was prompt and items that were needed when called upon were received quickly as well. We thought we were ordering soup dumplings that would be bite size and to our surprise we got one massive dumpling with many surprises that burst out of it. It was unique and good. Prices were really good. Rol San is cheaper than many other dim sum places I've tried in Houston, Vancouver, SF, NY, and Austin.  Must visit for their fried taro (not sure how their flat taro rice cakes are), quick service, great prices, and hot, good food. It's convenient that their dim sum is also served all day. Hats off to this well run establishment."}
{"text":"There's a lot of tasty dim sum in Chinatown. You'll find Rol San to be very busy, with lines inside and another in the front reception area.  Dim Sum is not cheap here, but the food is made with care and delicious. Standout was the pumpkin fried dumpling with custard. Why only three pieces??? Gimme some more of these delicious pumpkin shaped dumplings. It is fried, so best eaten on the spot. Though, I don't need any more urging after one bite, sweet, hot custard comes oozing out!  Har Gao and shrimp rice roll was delish with fresh tasting shrimp. The mushroom dumpling had nice, complex flavor and was also a favorite. The fried squid tentacles had nice flavor but could have been more generous with the portion, and the seafood dumpling was my least favorite. It wasn't bad, but a little more bland in taste. There are no dim sum carts here. Instead dim sum are made to order so be patient and expect to wait. If you have to budget how much you can eat, due to high prices, any of the neighbor bakeries is a good try for Chinese styled pastries."}
{"text":"Food is good. Price is ok (bit higher than most dim sum places I've been to in Markham). The worst part about this place is the line up out front - they don't give out numbers and they get confused as to who is next in line. It doesn't make sense to me. Everyone's wait is apparently 15 mins."}
{"text":"Vous aimez le 'dim sum'? Cette cuisine cantonaise où vous pouvez déguster une quasi-infinité de petits mets passés à la vapeur ou à la poêle? Rol San est sans conteste le meilleur 'dim sum' du quartier chinois. Le personnel peut parfois sembler braque, il suffira de faire un sourire ou de leur montrer votre connaissance de la cuisine pour gagner leur amitié.   Quelques conseils : si la carafe de thé est vide, retournez le couvercle ou mettez-le en biais, on vous amènera une nouvelle carafe. Pour vous servir comme un véritable cantonais, prenez les mets avec le haut des bâtons et mangez avec l'extrémité plus fine de celles-ci."}
{"text":"Very busy when we went on a Saturday lunch hour.  Yes, lots of  \"gwai los\" here.    The plus - everything is fresh since you're ordering off the menu. The minus - you can't see what you're ordering - so if you don't know what it is you could be in for a surprise.  I ordered tofu and it was just 2 tiny pieces of tofu with green onions on top.  The minus - they charge you for tea! The minus - because it was so busy they told us it would take long if we wanted certain items on the menu. The minus - cash only or above $20 Visa only no Mastercard  I'm not sure if I'll come here for dim sum again - I'd rather go somewhere where I'm not rushed and waiting..."}
{"text":"Over the holidays I was downtown shopping and made the mistake of coming to Rol San for dim sum. The food is \"ok\". Nothing unique or outstanding. Standard old school dim sum. But the whole place is absolutely filthy! Including the clothes of the workers, furniture, plates, cutlery, etc. Plus it's the worst customer service! Avoid this place - there are so many better dining options."}
{"text":"Originally, we wanted to go to OM Restaurant.  But Friday rush-hour traffic was just too horrific.  I don't know what we were thinking, traveling to the West-end at those hours.  Anyway, we ended up at Rolsan instead.  As usual, we had to order Crispy Beef in Ginger Spicy Honey Sauce.  If you haven't tried it, you should.  I just love the crispness of the beef and the blend of sweetness and spiciness of the sauce.  We also ordered Sauteed Scallop and Chicken in Chili and Pepper Sauce.  That wasn't bad either!  Still a fan!"}
{"text":"Awesome meal. Cheap, good variety with with efficient service. A smile from the waiters would get them an extra star."}
{"text":"The perfect hangover food on a Sunday afternoon. Cheap, amazing food that fits every budget keeps you 100% satisfied all the time! Plastic tablecloths make for quick and easy take down. We've tried other dim sum places but nothing compares to the almighty Rol San. We've been here at least 10 times now and keep coming back for more. Nom nom nom..."}
{"text":"Recommended.    Went for dinner yesterday to celebrate a friend's birthday.  14 of us showed up and were accommodated around a giant round table - a refreshing alternative to the conversation-killing \"banquet rectangle,\" as our whole party could be a prt of the dinner chat.  As one friend put it, \"this is the best restaurant in Toronto with white plastic table cloths.  In fact, the tables are lined with layers of them - just peel one off for each new seating.  Rol San isn't much for decor, but it was the food and company that we were interested in and Rol San delivered on both fronts.    On top of affording us a 14-person dinner conversation, the food was fantastic - we enjoyed some of their famous all-day dim sum (har gow and barbeque pork buns), and sampled for a host of dinner-time staple that included peppercorn beef tenderloin, sweet and sour pork and the classic chicken with mixed vegetables.  The family-style service and the ridiculously low prices (we got stuffed for $20 per person, all in) just made the celebration all the better."}
{"text":"Great place for canton din sum!! Good for family & friends. The waiters speak Cantonese, Mandarin and English. One thing bad is only receipting VISA and cash."}
{"text":"What a great find thanks to a friend. This place seems small but it's huge , Great Dim Sum fast service great prices . It's one of my fav"}
{"text":"I'm so glad I have leftovers from Rol San sitting in my fridge right now, beckoning me to eat at the slightest rumble of my stomach.   Almost everything was tasty and fresh -- not greasy, not heavy...i wish the meat pieces we got didn't have so much fat on them, though...I had to put that aside...mmm dim sum!"}
{"text":"Sadly another restaurant which used to be great and is now only hit or miss. I used to dine here frequently but the last year or so my experiences here have left me wanting.  There is nothing really specifically horrible about it but an apathy pervades both the food and the staff. Most recently four of us sat down to dine late at night and 3 of us ordered right away while the 4th took her time deciding. When she did try to order a few minutes later, a plain bowl of congee, she was told it would take 25 minutes! \"I just want a plain bowl of congee, can't you just spoon some into a bowl for me. Please?\" She said sweetly. \"No! There's other people that have ordered before you and their food will come first! If you wanted congee you should have ordered when you came in!\" She was so taken aback that my friend didn't order anything at all but picked at my food instead. That is, when it arrived, 20 minutes later.   The shrimp in my dish was frozen since the time when woolly mammoths roamed the earth and was rubbery. There were few of them, even though it was meant to be a shrimp stir fry, which may have been a blessing.  Another recent time I went for dim sum and while nothing was specifically wrong, it tasted as if they were ordering all their dim sum in packages pre frozen then keeping them constantly heated on steam.   I'm rounding up from 2.5 in honor of the wonderful meals I used to have at this restaurant... years ago."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Rol San Restaurant Cuisine: Chinese Location: Chinatown Address: 323 Spadina Ave Price Range: ~$10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4 Service: 3 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3  Extra information:  *Heart of Chinatown *All day DimSum *Visa only over $20 order and up  Rol San Restaurant is in heart of Chinatown and they serve Dim Sum all day (perfect for those who wants Dim Sum but can't wake up early!). They get very busy even after peak lunch hour and the line can get really long. The restaurant is quite big but there is no waiting area so everyone is squished together.   Each table is covered in plastic sheets and once people are done eating, they just wrap up everything (including the plates and cultleries) into a bag and take it away. This makes cleaning so quick and efficient for everyone.   Condiments already provided on the table are, Hot sauce, Red Vinegar and Soy sauce. I only ended up using Hot sauce from here.  Once you sit down, they give you this sheet and a pencil. Basically you write in how many of you want in the box beside that specific dimsum dish. I find this system to be quite convenient since I can order at my own pace. There were 4 of us and we ended up ordering around 8 dishes.  Ordered: SIU MAI, 4 pieces ($3.98) This is standard when you go for DimSum, it's always safe and usually yummy. This Siu Mai was big and plump with pork bits inside. There put bit of cod roe on top and this was delicious with the hot sauce.  Ordered: HAR GOW, 4 pieces ($4.28) This is my sister's favorite DimSum. Sadly, this specific HarGow had really thick and dry skin and it felt tough in my mouth. It was probably one of the worst HarGows I've ever tasted and I would not get this again.  Ordered: STIR FRIED SNOWPEA LEAF(Regular menu, $10.99) We just ordered this off of a regular menu because we wanted some veggies. This dish is pretty big and it had lots of garlic in it which is always good! This was good without any extra sauce.  Ordered: FRIED EGGPLANT WITH SHRIMP PASTE, 3 pieces ($2.88) This wasn't very good, there wasn't much shrimp paste inside and the eggplant was really tough. The sweet soy sauce poured over the eggplant was good but that's about it.   Ordered: DEEP FRIED SHRIMP DUMPLING WITH SALAD SAUCE, 4 pieces ($4.28) This came so hot and fresh out of the fryer. The wonton skin is very thin and it's filled with lots of shrimp. This was really good with the salad sauce (sweet mayo) that comes with the dish. I would def get this again.  Ordered: DEEP FRIED SQUID TENTACLE ($4.28)If you eat squid tentacles (just like calamari!), this is a must get dish. For $4.28, you get lots of deep fried squid and this was good with the salad sauce that came with my shrimp dumpling.  Ordered: CHINESE DONUT IN RICE ROLL ($4.28) I wanted to order this last time when I went to Spadina Garden but didn't get to so I jumped at the chance that I could. This dish was really big compared to other DimSum dishes. The donut was fresh and chewy and the rice roll was tasty with the sweet soy sauce and peanut sauce. I love this dish!  Ordered: DEEP FRIED SHRIMP ROLL, 4 pieces ($4.28) I didn't eat this because I was so stuffed by the time this came, but everyone who did told me it was really good. It's basically a shrimp spring roll. They told me the skin was really crispy and it was good with the sweet&sour sauce that came with the dish.  The bill came to $62.77 for 4 people. Everyone was so stuffed and couldn't eat another bite.   SUMMARY:Their service is quick and efficient and I really enjoyed their food. I recommend going a little early or later in the afternoon to beat the crazy lineups. Also, most of the dishes are served with 4 pieces so it would be better if you can find group of 4 to visit this place.  *chomp chomp*"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I feel about all the great reviews for Rol San.  While it's great to see Chinatown still relevant, the food truly is mediocre at best.  The restaurant seems to have become a victim of its own success. It's pretty evident that both the staff and food there seem to cater to a particular crowd (i.e. the non-Chinese folk) - very telling when some of the waiters are shocked to be spoken to in Cantonese.  No doubt this is the restaurant to go to after any night of clubbing and you're not ready to go home.  The place is like an afterhours club filled with drunken Mississauga clubgoers.  It's popularity might be owing to the fact that they used to serve \"cold tea\" after last call, but then again so was half the restos on Spadina.  Generally good for people watching, beautiful people with little substance eating so-so food with lots of substance.  I always keep my fingers crossed that the smashed Barbie-doll looking chick, who keeps flashing her panties, will wash off the rest of her runny mascara by planting her face in a bowl of chicken corn soup.  On the other hand, there may be random moments of community restaurant singing between the General Tao's chicken and Yang Chow Fried Rice - which actually in a very garish way is kinda special.  The majority of Rol San's business are people to drunk to eat to begin with, so it might be the reason most of dishes seem overly flavoured, and lack the subtleties that Cantonese cuisine can have.  There are certainly options for Cantonese food that are infinitely superior, when not inebriated like New Sky , as suggested in Ernest C's review.  As for dim sum, while it may be one of the better options in Chinatown, it's not passable vs. any number of Markham dim sum places.  There simply is no comparison.  And if you doubters don't believe me, ask any of your Chinese friends who live Markham when they last drove down on a Sunday afternoon to get to Rol San.  The dim sum caravan is usually going in opposite direction.   It would be redeeming for them to serve them on the carts (even if it means an occasional dim sum lady loogie in your beef tripe!) for nostalgic purposes, which many of the uptown dim sum houses lack.  Rol San - what can I say, but such a delightful necessary evil."}
{"text":"This will be the last time I eat at this place. Been going here for a long time and the quality of food has gone down greatly. But my issue is that this time the waiter decided to make a scene during payment. The tip was miscalculated and instead of coming to us and letting us know in private he decided to full on shame and embarrass us in front of staff and other guests. Everyone started staring and shaking their heads at us, we also noticed on our way out the waiter was already arguing with another customer about their bill. Our bill was settled and we left, upon arriving home we decided to recalculate our meal considering that we paid $165 after tax and tips, it seemed very high. We soon discovered that we were overcharged and our bill should've come up to $110 after tax. My advice would be to keep a copy or take a picture of the order form so you know exactly what you ordered and how much to expect your bill to come up too. Be prepared to argue with the waiters as they are rude, pushy and hard to understand if you don't speak chinese."}
{"text":"For some unexplainable and unknown reason, Rol San is one of the most hyped up dim sum restaurants in Toronto. It's just okay. The dishes are overpriced and you'll starve before getting a table. There's better places within walking distance."}
{"text":"The food was a tad below average compared to other Chinese restaurants around the area. The other restaurants were too crowded so we stumbled upon this one because it had available tables. What disappointed me the most was their rude waitress and her impatience when taking our large order. When we asked for the bill, I handed her my credit card. But I was immediately told they do not take Mastercards. There was a large sign at the entrance indicating that they take all major credit cards as long as they meet the $20 minimum. Our bill was $141.75 Canadian dollars. Another tourist trap? Thanks for the lesson!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant while in Toronto and loved it. It was very busy when we went on a Thursday afternoon but the staff is fast and efficient. This is no frills dining with plastic table covers that double as a fast way to clean off the tables (everything is picked up like a trash bag). We had the pork buns, deep fried octopus tentacles, seafood dumplings, pork and shrimp soup dumplings and shumai. The octopus tentacles were a little bland but everything else was very tasty."}
{"text":"My roommates and I went for a late Sunday brunch. It was packed but did not wait that long (about 15 min) until seated.  Since it was busy, it was hard to grab attention from waiters. Food was not awesome, but good."}
{"text":"Some of the best Dim Sum in the city. Yeah the decor is tacky and it's super crowded but the food makes up for it. Expect to spend $20-30 between two people. Note, they don't take reservations so make sure to go there early. It fills up fast."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best dim sum restaurants in North America. Chicken feet and steamed pork ribs are to die for. On the dessert side, they have this amazing pumpkin flavored pastry and I definitely recommend exploring the menu items if you have enough time in Toronto and/or you're going with lots of people.   Four stars only because they don't serve dim sum on carts - I know this is a weird reason but that's what dim sum is supposed to be like!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dim sum, good service, little wait. We went on Sunday for dim sum despite other reviews of long waits and poor service.  That was not at all our experience.  We had a five or so minute wait and good service throughout our dining.  The dim sum is fantastic, the best I've had, even in China.  Shrimp dumplings had real shrimp, not a paste.  Pork buns were pillowy with generous spicy filling.  Soup dumplings were not Shanghai style, but dumplings in broth and excellent.  The hit of the meal was minced beef and preserved vegetable in rice roll, think enchilada. Fried pork dumplings were excellent but similar to others we've enjoyed."}
{"text":"Love that you can order off a menu and don't have to hope for your favourites to come by on a cart. Like most dim sum places, go as early as possible to avoid peak time line ups...I'm talking as soon as they open cause there will be a line up after 11:30am. Items are a tad pricer but look bigger so it all balances out."}
{"text":"Went here seeing it was one of the most popular dim sum restaurants in toronto. However no one has put into thought the demographic of the group. To the average Chinese family this place would be mediocre. Pricing is relatively expensive and they provide priority seating to the non-Asians as they are the ones who would go all out and earn more revenue with.   Other then the above the food ain't bad. Hot, fresh,  and tasty. But can definitely find better else where.   Expect a good wait in line on a weekend."}
{"text":"Nice servants. Delicious food. Liked the lobster, char siu, steamed free run chicken, ong-choy, steamed fish!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Rol San for 20 years plus.  First off only go during busy hours.  That is, in the mornings.  Dim sum traditionally is eaten for breakfast or brunch, not dinner.  And you will find the best prices during morning hours - even late morning.  Night prices are broaching $5 per dish.    Rol San is on the expensive side. Their shumai is $3.88 - when traditionally this dish is one of the lower priced dishes.  I think these people have totally lost perspective here.  I mean $1 plus for each shumai??!!  Are u kidding me? Another thing that annoys me is their sticky rice - can you get any smaller?  That's the dish in dim sum that you order if you are big eater to fill you up.  Everything else should be dainty.  And the tea.  The tea should be complimentary.  I just came back from New York city not too long ago and ate at places in New York that charge $1 per dish!!!!  This got me thinking...  Hmmm... If New York can charge a $1 per dish, Rol San should definitely be able to charge better affordable prices.  And that goes for 90% of dim sum places in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm from San Francisco and grew up on Cantonese Dim Sum.  I've been to Toronto several times and Rol San is #1. It's so good it's the Dim Sum by which I judge all Of Canada. Expect to wait except on holiday weekends. Long Bean with Garlic is a favorite bit I recommend trying any of the assortment of entrees are great for everyone."}
{"text":"Dear Rol San,  Thank you for providing us with late night dim sum!  For a midnight snack or after a night of clubbing, you are always open.  What would late night dim sum be like without: *Being able to watch a drunken fist fight *A homeless dude passing though leaving one of those please-give-me-money-smiley-face cards at your table *Hungry triad members scarfing down dumplings  Even though I know you don't make your dim sum fresh, it tastes pretty decent, especially the spicy squid.  Sure, I've had tastier. Sure, you don't have the most exciting menu Sure, the clientele is questionable at times.  But that's okay!  You are still awesome.  Thank you again for always being there throughout the years.  I wonder what you look like during the day time!  Steph"}
{"text":"We`ve decided to give up on Gerrard Street East for Dim Sum, the har gow last time tasted like it was steamed in dirty dish water and the mouse that ran across the dining room kinda turned me off.  So Spadina is our new location for our early morning start.  We went Saturday early morning just before 10am they don`t have an early price but i don`t care anymore about that I just want to eat good food.  The order was:  steamed spareribs sticky rice in lotus leaf curry cuttlefish 2 stuffed bean curd with shrimp steamed bean curd roll har gow pan fried dumplings shrimp rolls 2x tea and one pop  $39 plus tip  (we had enough for leftover takeout for 2 kids)  The curry cuttlefish has great flavour but a bit overdone and chewy.  Everything else was piping hot and fresh.  The spareribs were a bit fatty.  On other visits we have had the chicken feet they are great but didn't feel like those this time.    The staff was attentive and all speak english really well (not a big deal if they didn`t but sure helps sometimes).  I will try to update time to time on how subsequent visits go.  The only thing about ordering from the card early in the morning is that everything comes at once some may not like that."}
{"text":"the customer service is bad. the food is heavily fried.  i have gone for years and the quality has just gone down while the prices have gone up."}
{"text":"I went there on a Sunday around 12:30pm. My parents and I had to wait about 15 min to get a table which I think is reasonable for such a busy spot. Despite the line up at the door I was impressed with how the server would routinely come by and acknowledge the new people that arrived and keep track of how many in the party. The line also seemed to move at a steady pace so it did not feel like we waited a long time.  Items on the menu were between $4-5.  About 40 items on the menu. Food arrived fast but also timing was nicely spread out. We ordered about 7 items and our bellies were content. Everything tasted good. They bring you tea automatically but it is $1 per person. We felt the service was good. We had interactions with about 3 different employees and everyone seemed to understand English. Bathroom was clean. Not more that I could ask for.  They only take VISA or cash."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"99% of the times I go there, it's around 3am after a night out, and I'm completely hammered. It's good! I usually get a bunch of different dumplings and share.  3.5*"}
{"text":"Really good dim sum that is available all day. No carts - you order off a menu. Numerous options on the menu. We ordered the seafood lo mein from their regular menu and it as a watery slop though, so if we go back, we'd stick to the dim sum menu only. Fast and efficient service. Hole in the wall setting."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum place, probably the best one in China town, freshness and delicious. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I have been going to Rol San for years.  Open late, great tasting food, fast (and you can say that with hyperbole - FAAASSSSTTT) service.  I'd say that a lot of people consider this a 'go-to', because it's incredibly busy on the weekends.  But for good reason!  Food selection is huge, and I've also found the guys are willing to accommodate custom orders if you're looking for something that isn't on the menu!  Because it prides itself on fast 'in and out' service, it wouldn't be the choice for sit-down ambiance.  But the food is great, and for out-of-towners I'd even say it's a part of the Toronto experience.  Consider this place if you're looking for some late night eats."}
{"text":"Quite good for dim sum. Really enjoyed the dumpling soup, so much so that we ordered it again. Pork buns were also good, as were the veggie dumplings. Beef spare ribs were a bit too fatty but tasty.  Limited veggie options. Service was good. Unable to order off of main menu before 11:15am."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto while on vacation. Looking for a good dim sum restaurant, was a little skeptic about many bad reviews but we tried it anyway. This place is SO GOOD!! Everything we tried was really really good! We were really happy with this place.   Try fried rice with salted fish!"}
{"text":"Remarkable dim sum! Delightful and flavorful. The buns were pillowy and soft like clouds. The fillings spiced perfectly. The shumai was my favorite. One advisory: the hot and sour soup is quite awful. The table cloths are made of disposable plastic, so when it's time to clean your table, they grab the whole thing like a bag and go!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of four hungry rugby players at 11am on a Sunday. The wait was quick (~5 minutes), although the line looked longer when we left. Once seated, service was very quick. Don't expect fine dining - the tables have layers of plastic tableclothes, so cleaning the table just consists of picking up the tablecloth and hauling it out of the dining room. The prices are very reasonable, 57 CAD for four hungry rugby players is very good.  Each of the 11 dishes we had were flavorful and hot, and the hot sauce was a big hit as well. In particular, we enjoyed the pork sticky rice, the shrimp dumpling, and the pumpkin dumpling for dessert.   -1 star because, as a dumb American, it was hard to order from the card without pictures or knowing more about what each item was. Really, that should be one star taken away from myself, as every item we got was tasty. However, I still walked out looking at other diners' plates and thinking, \"that looks good! what was that?\"."}
{"text":"Friend \"A\" reserved for a big group (20) to celebrate friend \"B\"'s birthday. The staff was very accommodating, holding two round tables for us, and when fewer than expected showed up (16) they had no problem with our idea of pushing the two tables together.   The food came fast and furious, from very attentive servers. We mostly had dim sum, and everyone was happy with it, but we did order a few vegetarian dishes for variety. The garlic broccoli was very good, the snow pea greens delicious, and the Buddha's Feast...well...it was bland like at every other Chinese restaurant. The hot & sour soup was weird.   We all left happy."}
{"text":"This place was great.  What could be better than dim sum all day.  Got here around 2:00 on a weekday.  Service was pretty good - helps if you can speak Cantonese.   We got 12 different dishes - all the dim sum was great.  Agreed - the room in the back isn't as nice but still okay."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dinner tonight. All Dim Sum items were great, noodles off menu not so much. Fried turnip cake was excellent. I was forewarned about overbilling but the bill was perfect. We would come back again!"}
{"text":"Food is ok, nothing special. I'd rather pay a bit more and go to the Pearl which is superior to Rol San in all aspects. They also don't take credit cards for orders under $20 which is a bit of a pain."}
{"text":"Been trying to come to this place for a year, but the line is always so long. Finally got a table quickly today. The prices are comparable to other dim sum restaurants around Chinatown. In terms of quality, I thought it was relatively better. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Rol San and Yummy Yummy Dumpings are my favorite Chinatown restaurants in Toronto.  Rol San is always crowded, always rushed feeling when eating there (i.e. they kind of rush you out the door once you're done eating), but it's that way for a reason: the food is good!"}
{"text":"The service here sucks. They're always yelling at you and no, it's not because I don't understand them, they're just mad all the time.  They have such a small selection of dim sum to choose from as well. Food was average, nothing special."}
{"text":"Authentic food. Poor service. You have to know what you're doing when you go in. If you don't, you won't get help. It's almost like a cattle run. Funnel people in, feed them, funnel them out. The place is huge & was packed at lunch on a Thursday. The food is very good, tho. Just go prepared, ask for water, utensils & anything else you might need as soon as possible because trying to get the server's attention is impossible."}
{"text":"This place is pretty busy but the line moves pretty fast. When you enter from the street, bee line to the back where they can give you a number. Food was excellent and cane out very fast. I was really impressed and left stuffed. My table of 3 over ordered but everything was very very good. I would definately come back here."}
{"text":"A couple introduced us to this place.  Since then we've been back several times.  Food is delish BUT always check your bill.  We went for Dim Sum last nite.  Our last two visits I was over charged on the bill.  The table two over overheard me and checked their bill only to discover the same.  Good food but real crooks!!!  FYI There is a hidden $0.60 charge per person for tea."}
{"text":"I've been told this is the spot for late night food. I was kind of disappointed that I wasn't more impressed with the food. I had the deep fried noodles with shrimp, it wasn't that good and neither were the shrimp rolls. They do have all day dim sum, I did try the har gow. It was really good and super fresh. If I were to go back it would probably be strictly dim sum."}
{"text":"We went to this Toronto chinatown dim sum restaurant on a Saturday. It was busy but we were promptly seated.  Unfortunately, this restaurant's dim sum are very expensive. A serving of \"har gow\" (shrimp dumplings) were $4.88. For lunch for two, the total with tax (not including gratuity) was more than $26, which is unacceptably expensive for restaurants in the area.  On a more positive note, the quality of the food was very good. Service was reasonable, and interior decor was acceptable as well.  Too expensive for my tastes, but if you want quality dim sum (at a price), this restaurant will fit the bill."}
{"text":"Came here for the dimsum and was a little disappointed.  There were so many positive reviews that I was expecting to be blown away... sadly I was not.     Service is very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Good tasty food for everyone. Our family stop here for dim sum and everybody enjoy it. Most of the staff are good."}
{"text":"As a Dim Sum fanatic, formerly living in the San Francisco Bay Area I was expecting real Dim Sum. The long line was promising. But they don't use carts, and have to say that nothing was good here. From benchmarks like har gao to chicken feet. Rather pricey. Will not be back"}
{"text":"Food is good...service is terrible. We came in a group of 5 and wanted to split the bill but staff here gave us such a terrible stink about it. We each told them what we ordered, but surprisingly I still got overcharged somehow. When I tried to look at the menu to see exactly what they're charging me for and how much the items were, they grabbed the menu from me and hid it. I had 1 order of the chicken wings and siu mai from their dim sum menu (about $5 each), and an order of the beef flat noodles in black bean sauce on the regular menu (approx $11). My total with tax should have been no more than $25, but I was charged $30. When asked why it was so high, I received no response. On top of it all, once again, service was terrible. It took more than 10 minutes to place an order no matter how many times we tried to wave down a waiter saying we would like to order. With that being said, we chose not to tip them. They were not too happy about this and caused a scene in front of everyone saying that we are no longer welcome to come back unless if we tip. The owner said to go to some fast food restaurant like McDonalds instead. At least I'm sure I'll be welcomed better at Mcds!!! Anyway, worst experience ever. It seems as if you're not a regular Chinese customer of theirs, they do not give you as much attention as the others."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty! One of the better dim sum places I've tried. No carts- you check off what you want on paper and they bring it out piping hot as it's ready. Walking through the front door it was a bit confusing as a couple people were waiting but there was no one checking us in now anywere to put your name down. Turns out there's a ticket system out back, in the larger dining room. Once we got our number the wait was maybe 20 minutes, not bad for a Saturday morning. The line definitely grew faster after we checked in though. All in all, a delicious meal at a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious dim sum. They make your food when you order it, so it's fresh. Easily fed a family of 4 for about $40 (including tips)."}
{"text":"I came here for dim sum w my family. They have some unique dim sum. I really like the boneless duck feet. It was delicious. The egg tart was also good. I never had white egg tart before so it was a good experience. The beef offals wasn't good. It lacks favoring. The egg plant with shrimp was good. Overall, it was a nice experience to have dim sum in Toronto."}
{"text":"The restaurant is much larger than it looks because it goes very far back so that's pretty nice.  Went in around noon and was worried I would have to wait but got seated quickly in the back room.  I liked how they let you order from the checklist.  Most places in Hong Kong these days don't push carts around anymore so I'm used to just going through the checklist.  The prices were pretty good; each item was around 1.88 - just over 3 bucks.  The food came pretty fast and seemed fresh enough.  It's a solid no-frills place in Toronto.  Thanks for the other reviews on Yelp for convincing me to try it."}
{"text":"I feel like the popularity of this place can be explained by the following conversation: \"Where can we get some cheap dim sum?\" \"Well, there's this place in Chinatown that's apparently got all day dim sum\" \"Oh, you mean the big red sign on Spadina?\" \"Yep.\" \"OK.\"  There are better places for dim sum, even in the downtown core, at pretty much the same prices. No, they don't all have giant red signs, but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make. I felt like I was eating gelatinized rice flour with a little bit of shrimp for the shrimp rice rolls.. and aside from that i don't remember much (and nothing being especially good, either). That being said, it's not actually bad for the price.  I would eat here again, but only if I'm passing by and felt like cheap dim sum. And rice flour."}
{"text":"Restaurant could use a bit cleaning!  Nothing like the smell of mold and unwashed dishes to incite my appetite.   Tables were covered by what seems to be white plastic garbage bags?  Easier clean up?   As for the Dim Sum, not fresh at all. It did however taste fresh from the freezer..."}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum!! Service is super nice and fast. I'm super picky about dim sum since there's an amazing place near my house and it certainly lived up to my expectation! Was pretty surprised at the lower ratings, I thought this place was great (and perfect for a hangover meal haha)"}
{"text":"The food here is decent. It is not that cheap compared to other dim sum restaurants. This place charges about $5.20 for most items and other places are much cheaper. The inside is kind of old and outdated and the utensils, plates and cups were not that clean. I had to use an alcohol wipe to clean them again for fear of food poisoning. The service is like most China town establishments, very hit or miss unless you speak Chinese. You won't get a refill of water."}
{"text":"I think there are a few reasons that Rol San is one of the most reviewed spots for Dim Sum in Toronto (location, amount of seating, location, they offer Dim Sum all day, and location).  Is it the best DS I've ever had? No no, it checks the boxes, looks and tastes mostly as it should but compared to some of the spots north and west of the downtown core, it's definitely nowhere near as good. I will say that they perform very well on items like Sui Mai, Har Gow, Chicken Wings and BBQ pork buns.   Due to the fact that it's in Toronto it follows why the price per order is nearly 1/3 to 50% higher than places outside the city. The average cost of a basket of items is about $5 vs $2 - 3.50 outside the city. We ordered a variety of items and our bill came to over $100 for 3 people - easily the most I've ever paid for Dim Sum @ any time of day.   I mentioned location because it is super convenient right in the heart of Chinatown on Spadina so there is no shortage of foot traffic here, and the fact that they offer Dim sum all day AND the venue is HUGE inside, are all contributing factors as to why Rol San has such a large number of reviews (average in rating however) over most other DT TO spots.  Would I return, sure. I think there are better options in Toronto and outside the city in terms of price and quality, but if I'm in the area and get the DS itch, I'll be back  Eatcret Out"}
{"text":"Good restaurant for decent and cheap dim sum! But the line-up on weekends is no joke.   The server who greeted us at the door had a mental list of who arrived first (which was around 10 groups at a time), so bravo to him.  TIP: There is also a back section of the restaurant and you can head to the back, past the counter, to wait for a table there. I haven't been but there are two queues happening.   You order by checking off what you want, although sometimes they come around with dishes. No cart service. All the dim sum we ordered were on point and we left very happy and quite full. Barely made a dent in the wallet.   This was an excellent find in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"Very good dim sum! Flavored are perfect. Not greasy or too salty. In LA we don't get dim sum This clean. Just as good as Hong Kong. Portions are bigger than what I'm use to, so order with that in mind."}
{"text":"One of my favourite dim sum restaurants in the city. I only come here for what I can \"Chinese brunch\".   Their dim sum is a tad pricier than other locations in Chinatown but it's offered all day (literally). I've been here after midnight on many drunken occasions stuffing my face with dumplings.  There's usually a small lineup at the front door but the restaurant has a back room so don't be discourage if you see a line. I'm usually seated in under 10 minutes.  Would highly recommend especially if you're looking for a step up from your standard after hours pizza."}
{"text":"They need to grow their business larger! It was packed on the Sunday morning and there's always a line of people waiting at the door. We were seated maybe after 20min. But once you are at a table, food arrives pretty fast. Due to limited space, they don't have strollers of food like a typical dim sum place. However, you can order from the a la carte menu and there are also entrees you can order from on a different menu.  The manager there was very nice and made sure everyone is taken care of even on a busy day like that.  Food was on par with other dim sum places I've been to. I didn't like their pepper sliced beef too much. And the congee doesn't look very appealing but tastes the same as other places. All other plates were pretty amazing."}
{"text":"BEWARE! RAT INFESTED!!!  While going to the washroom I was bit by a rat!  Was harassed by employees when I told them about my encounter and showed them by bleeding leg. Have never had such a terrible experience at a restaurant. Ever! Writing this from hospital, the doctors informed me that the rodent was likely infected with rabies for it to act in the way it did. They had to remove a tooth and I had to get stitches. I was in agonizing pain before the anesthesia. I had to leave the restaurant with a bloody leg, my son is still crying. No amount of legal settlement could be worth the trauma I experienced. Hopefully I don't get an infection.   Cannot believe that there are such dirty places in the city. Should be closed down before anyone gets hurt. Please don't risk your wellbeing by going to this place, especially if you're bringing any younger children."}
{"text":"Mediocre food lol   Had a better expectation considering plenty of HK celebs were here and I've heard good things about this place. Food was just.. meh alright, it's all I can say. Tasted like your average dim sum with nothing special, some chef's recommended dishes turned out to be far more mediocre than we expected."}
{"text":"This dim sum joint is a fixture in Chinatown with its rock solid stable reputation as predictable as can be. While not the cheapest place to eat, they do touch all the bases with Chinese food and cater to tourists and anybody looking for a dim sum fix any time of day. Add to that a menu including the classic dishes to go with your dim sum, and it is a winning combination. Best selection was an all-mushroom one, fresh, delicious and not too salty."}
{"text":"Come here if you want to enjoy the rudest staff in Toronto, the most mediocre food, be over charged, and then yelled at publicly when they don't deem your tip (that they don't deserve in the first place) is inadequate."}
{"text":"Right in the middle of China town, this place serves the classic dim sum dishes (shiu mai, har gow, etc.), but also have other unique one too.  What I like about it: affordable, good location, fast service (once you're seated)  What I didn't like: in line with what others have voiced, the long wait is the biggest issue (you also have to decide/gamble which line you want to wait in because there's another line in the back of the restaurant!)"}
{"text":"I wish I never stepped my foot into this place. The waitress and waiters here do not treat their customers like people and they feel entitled to provide bad service because they think they will always have the line out the door, because it's one of the only dim sum place downtown.   They wrongly charged our bill. Did not bring two items to our table. Good thing I took a picture of the food to prove that we only got one serving of two dishes instead of 2 orders which they have charged us for.   One of the old lady yelled at us and gave us attitude because we had a baby stroller. The waiter gave us attitude when we said the table near the door was too windy for my elderly grandma. Getting the money back which they wrongly charged us for was like pulling teeth.  Also, when we pointed out the bad service to the server, she goes \"yea, I never smile, so what?\"   I don't expect amazing service from these restaurants, but treating people badly is just not acceptable.  MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR BILL. Because on the receipt they do not write down all the dishes you are charged with."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was typical but hate the plastic table clothes.  Some of the dim sum was really good, I.e crispy shrimp, beef balls, and hargow.  The beef satay noodles were the opposite- do not recommend that dish.  I would have given 3 stars but super annoyed that they took only visa or cash... No interact or othe credit card."}
{"text":"Worst customer service in town. We ordered a soup but they didnt give us spoon to eat and i have to ask for couple of time for them to give me one. The worst thing is before we leave there was one woman came to my table ask for tips and saying that she wants exactly 10%. We just wanted to pay for our bill because the service really bad here. But she insisted on tips so we left around $2 or more. But she asked for more. So rude. We were just saying thats all we got for u n left.  Seriously, where the hell did she come from? I didnt see her the whole time. She didnt even serve us at all"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The food is full of flavor, piping hot, and super affordable. It is a packed house any time we've come here.    Their in house made hot sauce is amazing. The service is average overall unless you get one of the younger girls serving you. Can't say anything bad about this place."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty good, I would NOT get the fried squid tentacles like some people have recommended. The food is above average for a dim sum place. My major complaint would be that their cups and dishes are bleached and the smell remaining is pretty awful."}
{"text":"Rol San is consistently sighted as one of the better places for dim sum for the people who can't venture to the suburbs for good dim sum. My last visit here was very underwhelming and not memorable. We went on a weekday and on an odd hour (read no line ups as we were a bit late for dim sum) service was quick. Most of the items were ho hum and the yardstick for dim sum: Har Gow  was very ordinary. We ordered several other items but could only order so much as there were only two of us. The final tab wasn't low so its not inexpensive as well. I could have been far better off by going to Crown Princess or even Pearl Chinese in Harbour front. They have a much better/cleaner ambiance and quality IMO."}
{"text":"Rol San - your a trusty friend at 3:30am following a night of delicious beer drinking. Your opened late and you taste pretty good (at least I think you do!).  Never really had to wait for a table but I tend to get there well after the 2am initial post club rush. Lots of large tables for big groups. The servers are friendly and efficient. The owner is always smiling and making jokes. The Restaurant appears clean but the washrooms can be a little rough late in the evening.  My favourite dish is the Chicken and Black Sauce - always hits the spot. Give me a bowl of steamed rice and I'm a happy camper. The noodle dishes are also good but sometimes the sauce can be a little runny. Veggies are fresh.   That's usually all I remember...  BK"}
{"text":"Dim Sum is awesome!!!  The turn off is they try to gip you on the bill.  WATCH YOUR BILL!!! My husband and I caught them, we got the heads up off another review site (sorry I have to post it so that you know I'm not lying)...  http://toronto.ibegin.com/restaurants/rol-san-restaurant  So we took heed, sure enough they tried their little scam on us too.  We know that this is calculated and premeditated by them because when my husband went back, even cooks and stuff came out concerned about what was going on up front.  My husband worked at a chinese place for years and knows the workings, so we caught them.  Our guess is, they split the extra money gipped off the customers, which trust me, at the end of the night on dim sum days - Sun thru Thurs - can add up to a lot!   We were told they always charge at least 5 - 10 bucks more on your bill and if you don't watch it that is what happens.  We got gipped about 7 bucks.  I paid on my credit card and so they gave us cash back in our hands after we told them about it and they recalculated it.  I'm telling you these guys were sweating.  Let them try it again and they'll see what happens...humph.  Anyway, it was nice to see them sweat.  I was p*ssed off about it.  It's never nice to be taken advantage of, especially when you work hard for your money and they are barely workin' at the time you spend in their restaurant since there is so much staff on dim sum days... On this particular event we went late on a Sunday so they had more employees than they needed at the time and it was slow, so a lot of them were just standing around chatting (I guess while plotting on how to scam US!).  Joke was on them though.  I suggest, that when you order you take two slips from the waiter, one you will give to them and one you keep for yourself to tally up your items."}
{"text":"Very very average for dim sum.  I have had better in other places in North America.  Plus, it's Toronto, I expect better.  I would not go back to this dim sum place.  We have better in Philadelphia.  Plus, the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Been here twice and had the chicken feet, turnip cake, fried squid tentacles and the Shiu Mai dumplings. All well executed especially the chicken, although dumplings a long cry from home made ones. Interior and service without frills but adequate."}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero I would have.  I am not a picky eater and I have never in my life walked out of a restaurant before coming here.  I tried ignoring the long, black hair I found in my Cantonese chow mein but I could not ignore the dead mosquito floating around in noodles sauce. Enough said.  I nearly threw up after seeing this, politely pointed it out to the waiter and left the restaurant. I called the city's health inspector and hope this place closes down if there are other health violations."}
{"text":"I feel like Rol San is O.K with a capital O. The Dim Sum is cheap, cheerful and pretty decent. Some are hit and miss, with the hits being the shu mai and some of the other dumplings. Some of the pork spare ribs were grisly to the point of being inedible so I would avoid that. Service is the standard China town speedy."}
{"text":"It was my second time here. I wanted to have dim sum for New Year so here we came!   There was a waiting line when we got there. However, it didn't take too long. The waiter handed the line very well. I was glad that I decided to come here on New Year day.   We were seated in front of the cash register. It was like in the middle of the dinning room. The restaurant is bigger than its look. They have another dinning room which can accommodate for big parties at the back. They also use PLASTIC tablecloth for dinning tables which makes it easy for them to clean and set up tables in a few second. Is it good? Umm.. I'm fine with it though as long as tables are not dirty.   DIM SUM is served ALL DAY which is perfect. They open until 2 am. So, it's good for night owls right?   We ordered Shiu Mai, Har Gaw, Deep fried squid tentacle, deep fried chicken wings, Steamed BBQ pork buns, Sesame paste balls, Pork meat & shrimp dumpling in Chiu Chow style and crab meat with fish maw soup. The best part was Shiu Mai!  They were so big and yummy!  Now I knew why every table ordered it. The rest of our order were delicious too.  Only Har Gar and Fish Maw soup were just OK.   How was the service? I didn't expect to talk to our waitress much because she didn't seem like to speak english. It was good enough for me (again) as long as she got our order correctly. It's Chinese restaurant and I always understand that.    Definitely come back again DIM SUM DIM SUM ;)"}
{"text":"Ok, so good is pretty good, portions are decent, and staff is friendly.  That said, service is slow, and some items lacked decent enough quality to push to a 4 star.  Solid for sure, just nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"This is our go to dim sim place, always good food,fast service and good value.   There are usually line ups on the weekends, but don't be discouraged, they seat you fairly quickly, and it's worth the wait.   Dim sum is ordered through a menu that you check off, very simple, but not the standard style of cartts moving around the dining room.   Love the fried  squid tentacles!!  mm mmm mmm!  This place is very consistent, i'll always be back"}
{"text":"Great dim sum spot. Food was all tasty and came out quickly. 1 star off because the steamed BBQ Pork buns were inadvertently mixed up with steamed buns with chicken, mushrooms and ginger. The waitstaff wasn't readily available to swap those out and refill water, etc.  would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This is my go to dim sum joint. A few must try's if you're ordering of the dim sum menu: Hargow Sui Mai Steamed BBQ pork buns (!!!) Fried bean curd with shrimp paste Beef short ribs Tripe Eggplant with shrimp paste  Fried squid tentacle Black sesame paste ball for dessert   They get really busy around dinner time but they are really good about managing the volume. I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 20 mins for a table."}
{"text":"The dim sum is ok but the service is lacking and there was a leak from the ceiling onto our food. When we told they didn't do anything about it. There is no order to their lineup. Ive been there twice with my bf and sometimes they tell you to line up outside or inside."}
{"text":"I was really thinking about giving this place a 4 star rating as the food is really quite good here but in contrast, the service is mediocre and their prices are just a bit more expensive than other places in the area that serve similar quality food.  Getting back to what makes this place good is the food. You can't go wrong here with either their Dim Sum or their Dinner options. The quality is solid every time! Since there are so many other good restaurants in the area, these days I'll typically only find myself coming here for Dim Sum during no traditional hours because on weekends, their line-ups usually exit the out the front door.   Really, the find word is that you won't go wrong at this place but you have great options to explore in the area as well."}
{"text":"Rol San has a very no frills appearance, from the plastic table cloths to the big banner proclaiming \"ALL DAY DIM SUM\" below it's front sign, but as we all know appearances can be deceiving. I think this place serves the tastiest Chinese food I have had in the city (although to be fair, I don't eat Chinese food often so I am probably not the *best* judge). My personal favourites include the BBQ pork buns, shu mai dumplings, fried noodles with shrimp (like cantonese chow main but just with shrimp - what's not to love!!), and the spicy crispy honey ginger beef (SO flavourful).   They are open until ridiculously late - making this place a dangerous temptation for late night binges. But once in a while, it's totally worth the splurge."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum. You won't be disappointed. Very cheap too. 6 of us and its only about $80. Usually it would cost at least $120 in the US. It was Saturday brunch but the wait was not too bad. Very busy but very fast service as well. Definitely will be back next tome in Toronto."}
{"text":"There usually a line up at this place, which usually leads me to head to Noble Seafood for their dim sum instead (I hate lining up!), but this time I decided to wait it out and surprisingly the line moved quickly and we were seated within 10 minutes or so. There were a couple of items I hadn't seen on a dim sum menu before which was refreshing, and the fried eggplant with stuffed shrimp paste in soy sauce was incredible. Everything else I had was your standard dim sum fare but I give them extra points for everything coming out quickly, and being really easy to flag down a waiter whenever we needed something. My favorite part of the experience was the way the waiter grabbed the tablecloth from all sides and simply swooped up all the dirty plates, revealing a clean tablecloth underneath ready for the next customers. Awesome!"}
{"text":"food comes out fast and steaming hot!  decent prices and decent selection.  pretty good place for chinatown dim sum."}
{"text":"Came here twice during vacation in Toronto.  The food on the whole here is very good, as it is pretty authentic as far as chinese food goes. In particular, I thought the shrimp dumplings and the lotus wrap were really good. Although it is a staple of dim sum in general, I'd actually recommend staying away from the siu mai, as it's not as great as it could be.  On prices, I suppose things are fairly priced, as far as things go for food in Toronto. Keep in mind that you should try and keep track of what you ordered, because when you pay, THEY DON'T GIVE YOU A RECEIPT OF WHAT YOU SPECIFICALLY ATE, so there is a good chance that the bill may be incorrect. If you're one of those types that doesn't really pay attention to this kind of stuff, then disregard the point above.  The most important thing to note is the wait times. If you're going to go on a slow day, then you're thinking the right way. If you want to go on a saturday or sunday however, please try to get there early, as you REALLY do not want to show up at like 1:00 PM and have to wait for 1.5 hours for a seat.  The ambiance is similar to that of dim sum places in Hong Kong/China. Don't come here expected too much quiet or anything. In terms of service, it might take a server a while to get to you, so try not to be too annoyed about this. Considering the number of people here, it is somewhat to be expected that they take awhile. But once you order the food, it should come pretty quick, as they really want to get you out fast in order to seat more people. If service sucks, just tip poorly."}
{"text":"Best ALL DAY DIM SUM in Toronto. We have loved this place for years and will keep coming back. Try the black pepper beef ribs."}
{"text":"Best. Almond. Chicken. Ever. It is unlike anything you have ever had before, I promise. It was not a chicken dish with a few scattered almonds (which, hey... I *do* like!) but it was chicken tenderloin coated in slivered almonds and deep fried. It was fried chicken with almond as the crust. Mind blown! SO GOOD!!!   The portions were very large when we went for dinner, too, so when we go again we will likely order less so we're not carting leftovers all over town with us.   The service was friendly without being overbearing, too, so that was good. Prices are excellent. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since 1990.the food was excellent but not anymore.i have been overcharge on my bill twice this month.the fist time by 10.00. I had already given a tip.Second time by 11.00 ,I bought takeout  and when I check my bill and called a very rude guy said he cannot speak English.the shrimp egg fuyueng had about 3 pieces of chopped shrimp and I was charged 15.00 for that.I also bought another mixed veg with shrimp and I got 4 small shrimp in the order.The dim sum is still okay but do not buy off the menu especially shrimp dishes.very poor service.I loved their food but it's not the same anymore and they rob you blind. Something weird is  going on there."}
{"text":"The Dim sum was very good, service is kinda slow. BUT the fried  shrimp dumplings they were some of the best I ever had. I ate one order by myself!! The main courses are good but not as cheap, but then again the food in Toronto is all a little higher. I would go here once a week just for the great fried shrimp dumplings. Portions are large and place was reasonably clean. There are a few small dumpling stores across the street which are cheap and really good. Our only real restaurant disappointment was at the Dumpling House up the street, the food was tasteless. Eat here and try their dim sum.. Ohhh the fried shrimp dumplings!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Dim Sum in the city. If you don't mind the lack of decor, this place is fantastic! Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Been here more times than I can count, usually with just one other person. We usually get six dishes between the two of us and gorge ourselves.   What's great:  Leaf-wrapped sticky rice. Never dry and flavourless like some other places tend to make 'em, and always chock full of little bits of meat and Chinese sausage... Har gow: big pieces of juicy shrimp in rice wrappers! mmmm... Eggplant stuffed with shrimp: the eggplant gets a light, smoky flavour and delectable texture from the frying, and the shrimp compliments it well with a stronger, denser taste.  WARNING: avoid this place on holidays! We came here for Easter and both the front and back rooms had lineups. Considerable lineups. They seat people by numbers, rather by when you get there (reason for the -1 star). So if a family of five comes in fifteen minutes after you do, and a table for five opens up, they'll be seated before you do. Which makes sense for business, but doesn't make me happy!"}
{"text":"Cheap and good dimsum.   We had the har gou, xiu mai, wrapped noodles (with shrimp), sticky rice with chicken wrapped in lotus, deep fried calamari, deep fried shrimp, deep fried sesame balls stuffed with red bean, crab and shrimp dumpling in soup... packed during lunch but fairly fast turnaround"}
{"text":"Simply delish! I tried the vegeterian and seafood dim sums and it was great. My faves were the veggie steamed dim sum and the steamed shrimp dim sum. On the sweet side, the pumpkin and sweet potato dim sum was out of this world good!  Their seafood dish (#101 on menu) was pretty good too. I'm definitely coming back here!!"}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, I was happy to have experience dim sum in Chinatown. I'll be honest at first when I walked in it looked like they could only seat about 10 people forreal. But then after walking a little more to the back I was surpirsed that they had a nicer, and larger tables to fit bigger parties. The service was just as a typical dimsum restaurant. They had some pretty good siu mai! Probably will go next time when i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Average dim-sum restaurant amongst many in Chinatown. But this one is ALL DAY DIM SUM. I came to Rol-San because they had many reviews on yelp compared to the other dim-sum places (perhaps because they're \"all-day\"). I was seated immediately, given an \"order-card\" and got to work. I ordered 10 dishes ranging from veggies, meat, soup, and a milk tart dessert. My total came out to be around $50, they also charge each person $1 for tea! The dim-sum dishes were either a hit or miss, but my favorite had to be the rice noodle with donut inside. Service was decent, and I have no complaints there. However, I'll stick with NYC dim-sum from now on, theres just something about the dim-sum carts rolling around with piping hot dishes that just makes my mouth water!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst dim sum experience I've ever had.  Flavorless, the cheapest ingredients available, fatty, greasy, and to boot, the service was totally inattentive. Although this was recommended by two different people, we found it dreadful and would never return."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's day and had HORRIBLE and rude service!! The older woman with short black hair, who is probably the owner, that was serving us was very rude. Plates and food were thrown on the table when order arrived, were dirty, and didn't bring us napkins or water even when asked multiple times. We had to flag down a male waiter to get them. No please and thank you's for anything. When she dropped the dim sum bamboo steaming bowl on the floor because she was in a rush I picked it up and handed it to her. She grabbed it and said nothing and walked away. Wow, rudeness. Also, there was a teapot on the table when we arrived that we didn't order and ended up being charged for it in the end! When we tried to ask her a question from the menu about the sauces she didn't want to explain or she didn't understand and just left, never even sent someone else to explain. If I could understand Chinese I wouldn't be asking. After we finished and we were paying by Visa she took my Visa card to insert it herself into the machine (a little weird but not life changing) but I noticed she skipped the option when it says 'hand to customer' prompt and went straight to 'ENTER TIP' WITHOUT ASKING ME!! Are tips not optional in Ontario? Why can't I choose? I told her I don't want to leave a tip, so she asked why, was the food not good? I said no, the food was fine but your service was horrible. I already paid for the food (mind you it was overpriced as it is), I don't need to pay for it twice. Just for that and being greedy I did not want to leave a tip, I was furious with the whole situation and her attitude. She insulted me after and said I was a 'special customer' in front of the other patrons. What a great way to show what a disgusting and small minded person you are. Did you? ever think if your service was good? When you screwed up the order I didn't say anything and was missing one of the dim sum orders, we didn't complain. I was willing to give her a tip even after that. But when she attempted to commit fraud with my Visa that was the last straw. No tip for you!!! Also we were a party of 2, so gratuities would not have been auto added for us I believe (only for large groups). Never again at this place!!! There are too many better choices around here to be insulted by a mean rude owner who would commit fraud to get a 2 dollar tip. The food was okay, but not good enough to tolerate her bad attitude!"}
{"text":"FIRSTLY - YOU MUST MUST MUST MUST GET THE MANGO PUDDING! You will thank me later! :)   I come here often. Food is great - very authentic in my opinion! Price is a bit pricey in comparison to neighbouring dim sum restaurants. Extremely casual ambiance with the hustle and bustle. Hard working staff!"}
{"text":"Pretty dirty place. But will get your dim sum fix downtown. Nothing stands out. But nothing is bad. I would come back again. It's consistently at this same level. No surprises!"}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum.  Restaurant is much bigger than you think. I really liked the back room.  Service is fast. Food is fresh. I have eaten my fair share of authentic Chinese dishes and this place did not disappoint.  With so many places in Chinatown to try I was glad it was recommended to me while on a food tour.  Definitely go back.  Tried many dishes on surprising one was beef tripe. If you didn't know what it was you'd assume it was calamari.  The classics like dumplings and bao were great.  If you've never tried dim sum bring a group of friends and an adventurous appetite. Take your time and enjoy sampling a variety while chatting."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum was priced relatively cheap and the food came out pretty quick despite the restaurant being packed. We had some of standard Dim Sum items like Har Gow, Sui Mai, etc. and it was alright though nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Decent place for dim sum. Not sure what the fuss is but that's what brought us in there  (twice, no less) on two of the coldest days of the year so far. First day we attempted Rol San, the line up was out the door and along the street. Wasn't about to wait that long. Not even for the most badass of Har Gow. We returned later in the week and had the a la cart dim sum. It was good. Somewhere in the top 10 of my favourite dim sum places in the GTA but nothing extraordinary. The food is sweeter than your average chinese fare. The hot and sour soup in particular was a disappointment. I'd go back if I were in the area but I still wouldn't do the insane wait."}
{"text":"Downtowners. Yes, you have all the late night fun. Yes, you get the sports teams. Yah, you get the concerts and big events. The TIFF and Caribanna? Ya, you have that too.    But Surburbians? We have Dim Sum! Dim Sum I say! And nobody can ever take that away from us!   People regularly tell me that Rol San is one of the better dim sum joints downtown. If it is, I pity the downtowners. For $3 - $5 for a plate, you get very average quality dim sum. Not bad, but not great, and certainly not near the value you'd get uptown (and value is a very important aspect of dim sum, ask any Chinese person!)   I suppose it'll do if I'm craving some har gow and milk tarts, but I'll stick to my uptown faves."}
{"text":"Rol San feature all day dimsum, located on Spadina! The food here is good but not exceptional, the staff are kind and straight forward too. However, unless you're buying a lot of dim sum, you might not may be full from the dishes.The prices are relatively affordable, but some dishes like shumai was around $5 which is on the expensive side compared to other places I've been to. I do think they offer a good deal though with all day dimsum and quick service!"}
{"text":"I guess I was one of the unlucky customers... I came here at midnight because of the great reviews. I got hot and sour soup, shrimp dimsum, pork + chives dimsum and deep fried squid tentacles and hated everything. Didn't finish it and left the restaurant still hungry. The best part was my yummy fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Strong 4/5. Been quite a few times and the experience is always consistent.  Don't be afraid to ask the server for the disposable wooden chopsticks, as the big plastic ones set on the table can be cumbersome to maneuver. Aside from the menu you could also ask for a portion of choy sum - sautéed chinese cabbage-to add some fiber to the dumplings and such. My personal favorite is the taro puff balls while the recently discovered deep fried shrimp dumplings are also worth a try."}
{"text":"1.5 stars:    Being of Chinese descent, I know what's good dim sum, and Rol San just doesn't serve it. Believe me, people. The food here is dry, bland and lame. So not worth the calories.  Okay, maybe it wasn't good because I went during off-peak hours?  But then again, I did order a non-dim sum item, and that was also bland and lame. So there.  You want good dim sum? Go up north to the burbs like Richmond Hill, Markham, etc. Spring Villa and Sam Woo are good. I loved Ambassador, but sadly it closed :(   I know going to the boonies for good dim sum is a pain, which is why I rarely go anymore. Sigh.   But if there is someone else here of Chinese descent who knows of a good dim sum place in Toronto's Chinatown (or near downtown), please tell me where. Pleeeeease...  :("}
{"text":"Went here with my friends after the club.The food was so bad we gave it to the homeless guy outside. I hate most Chinese food anyways"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here I am not disappointed.  I always order the Deep fried squid, Special fried rice, and Beef with gai lun and it is always really really good and consistent!  Come here with big groups after the club and you are always sure to enjoy good entertainment from the post club patrons.  Last time I was here we had a concert in the restaurant...well it was actually some drunk girl singing Justin Bieber songs for about 5 minutes but it was awesome! Haha!  She was actually pretty good.  Anyways...the service is typical chinatown service.  However, the food is impeccable and always delicious.  Watch your bill at the end to make sure there are no \"secret\" charges of course...."}
{"text":"Absolutely HORRIBLE service - save yourself from an angry lady yelling at you in Mandarin and don't waste your time.  The waiters/waitresses were slow, rude, unhelpful, and seemed to have an attitude that the customers weren't worth their time. They failed to greet us when we walked into the restaurant, and our orders took much longer than average to arrive. When we asked for extra plates and chopsticks, they would give us one less than we needed, and it would take them at least 10 minutes before they would give us another one. When we asked for the bill, we held up our credit card to gesture that we needed the machine, but one of the waitresses came and wordlessly took our bill away (without the credit card), walked around in a circle, and then gave it back to us for no reason with no explanation.   Given the poor service, my friend and I decided that they were not deserving of a tip so we simply paid the full amount for the meal. The lady who gave us the machine noticed, and then proceeded to harass us loudly in Mandarin about why we didn't tip and if we were planning to tip using cash or credit. My friend and I were so shocked that she had the audacity to call us out on it that we didn't say anything. She then left and we got up to leave quickly. My friend walked out first and I began to follow her, but the same lady stopped me in my path and wouldn't let me leave until I paid tip. All I had in cash with me was $1.50, so I put it on the table, but she screamed at me that it wasn't enough and asked to see my credit card. When I took it out, she grabbed it out of my hands, took it to the machine, and inputted a tip amount for me without even letting me choose how much I wanted to tip. By then, she had already caused a scene in front of the entire restaurant by yelling at me so aggressively that other customers began to turn around and stare. She wouldn't let us leave without paying tip, so eventually I paid and left without a word.  While walking home, fuming about our horrible experience, we checked to see if the take-out we got was the correct order. It was not. We specifically requested shrimp dumplings by marking it on the paper, but they gave us Tsui Mai.   Do not waste your time here. While the actual food is good, the staff clearly does not respect their customers and they have no problems with using verbal harassment to get what they want. There are many other dim sum places in downtown Toronto that have equally good (if not better) food, and I'm sure their staff are half-decent human beings unlike the ones here."}
{"text":"This place is chinese equivalent to your hometown greasy diner that serves all day breakfast and doesn't care if you waltz in wearing a tank top, pajama pants and slippers because you're hung over and you just don't give a rats ass what you look like but are in serious need of greasy (sometimes overly greasy) dim sum.  It's not the greatest dim sum on the planet, far from, but everything you get is solid, and tastes the way it should.  As another yelper mentioned, everyone knows this place because if it's incredibly large and tacky \"ALL DAY DIM SUM\" sign out front. You can't miss it."}
{"text":"This place is great!! The food is delicious, the service is fast and the waiters are nice. Not to mention the prices are very cheap. I walked in hungry and I walked out happy, and full.  They're a lot of different choices from the menu, dessert everything included if you just want to experience Dim Sum or you can order full entree dishes, and they offer this all day which is amazing!!  The dimsum wont be the best you've ever had but if you really wanted more you'd choose a place thats a lot more expensive, but going out for Dim Sum in Toronto NOT SCARBOROUGH this place is a GEM.  The place is clean, well kept and the service is very friendly and everything came out fast and hot.  I will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"This is your typical dim sum restaurant in the downtown area. Largely popular due to its local in the heart of Chinatown. The quality of dim sum served @ Rol San is a hit or miss. I have visited a couple of times and have experienced different levels of quality. I find that the weekend lunch service is often better than dinner.  I would recommend this place for those that are craving dim sum for lunch on a weekend/"}
{"text":"Pretty good food so we might return but we are still looking for the perfect location. This place isn't bad but my family prefers the places with the cart that allow you to choose dishes throughout your meal. Ordering from the card in advance doesn't let you see new items you might like or slowly add to your meal depending on how the first few items are sitting."}
{"text":"Some of the best dim sum I've had. I would have never found this place. Thank you Yelp. Great find.   Pros: excellent flavors, texture and affordable   Cons: long wait. Prepare to wait. Atmosphere is typical Chinese restaurant. A little run down and lots of wear and tear. Come for the flavors and not the ambiance."}
{"text":"Rol San is one of those restaurants that's a good introduction to the Chinatown experience and will give the courage to try out smaller restaurants in the area. It serves up good dim sum in a quick fashion for the right price but not being a hidden gem of  Chinatown expect it to always be crowded. I haven't had a bad experience here, I don't expect very friendly service since they are always crowded the staff expect you to know what you're doing and order in a timely fashion. Can be intimidating but it's not like they will give you death stares if you decide to take your time deciding.   I always worry that they would bring over the wrong dish or forget a dish because the very few times it's happened to me trying to sort out things can be confusing. But it's an affordable meal and you can be left full for under $15 a person. I've not been disappointed by any of their items nor have I been really blown away by an exceptional dish here, so overall it's a pretty safe bet to visit here."}
{"text":"Have been to Rol San many times and went today for Christmas brunch. The food never fails to please. Great dim sum. Must try are their black pepper beef spare ribs... The best ever! Very well-marinated and flavorful. Shrimp dumplings are awesome. One of the best dim sum places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place gets really busy and the staff turns over the tables really quickly.  The food is at a reasonable price, but it was mediocre at best.  We tried PLENTY on the menu, beware of contents, some may be graphic.  I've been to many dim sum places in my day and we always measure the value, the size of food and the taste!  I love dim sum and I always compare based on the HAR-GOW.  The HAR-GOW was not the greatest, small and the skin was doughy and thick.  The SHRIMP RICE NOODLE was lots of noodles and little tiny shrimp.  We ordered the BRISKET and COW STOMACH, the brisket was alright, but the COW STOMACH (which I've enjoyed in other restaurants before) was flaky and gross.    The TURNIP CAKE was delicious, full of flavor and with fresh turnips embedded in.  The RICE WRAPPED IN LOTUS LEAF was tasty, good size and taste.  My accompanies really liked the PAN-FRIED DUMPLINGS, they were huge in size and filled with fresh ingredients!  The BBQ PORK BUNS are always a fan favorite, and although they could have added more BBQ pork into it, the taste was divine!  The service... very interesting.  They pretend they don't hear you and are always giving you the cut eye.  But they hear you, bring you everything you ask for and is quite efficient in their service.  So, they get it done but they are kind of rude.  I am big on service, even in these mom and pops shops.  So that's my take!  Would maybe go back again, but I do think that there are definitely better dim sum places out there to be explored!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place to have dim sum downtown. They make the best xiajiao (Shrimp dumpling?) Unfortunately, they usually have a big line during the weekends around lunch time. Speaks for their popularity more than anything, since the interior is actually quite big."}
{"text":"Rol san is my staple dim sum place, but you need to order the right things from the menu as I think they've perfect some dishes and neglected others. They changed the formula of the clamari as it is now more sweet than savoury, it's improved but not worth ordering. What is best is the spareribs (cant get this good anywhere else), tripe with ginger (the best), short ribs with black pepper sauce. I also like the pumpkin cashew dessert items."}
{"text":"Walked in sometime around midnight on a weekday looking to satisfy the munchies after a concert. First time here but I was looking forward to some dim sum.  Ordered Deep Fried Tentacle, Har Gow (Shrimp Dumpling), Beef Tripe, Spare Rib in Black Pepper Sauce and Mango Pudding.  Fried Tentacles were greasy and not as crispy as I like from other dimsum places but the flavors are still there.  Har Gow is pretty average. I only ate 1 piece but the bf wolfed down 7 pcs before I could eat more.  The braised beef tripe for me was the standout. Very tender and not overcooked/rubbery. Loved it!  The other dishes were your standard low-end comfort dim sum. If you want tasty cheap Chinese eats, then Rol San is your place.  Service is prompt and very typical Asian. They'll ignore you until you wave them over but they're quick to clear empty dishes and refill tea."}
{"text":"I was looking for some good lunch and came across Rol San thanks to my Yelp app. It looked decently promising as the food pictures looked legit. We walked in around lunch time and were told to walk towards the back section of the restaurant where there is a separate room, a room with poorly painted neon yellow and green walls. After awkwardly standing there for what felt like a long time and being ignored by the male and female servers, we were finally told to go sit over at a small table by the rude man who gave us zero eye contact. I looked at the menu and noticed that there is a charge of $0.80/person for tea. Charging for tea is absolutely a norm at most dim sum restaurants but I was annoyed when the man gave us a teapot automatically without even asking if we wanted tea in the first place or what type of tea we would like. I was actually not planning to drink tea because I am currently on a caffeine-free diet but I ignored it. Then when I finally noticed that my fork was dirty with a piece of saucy food stuck to it, we just had to get up and leave. Hey, I don't have high expectations from Chinese restaurants to be clean but I would like it to be at least to the naked eye - I don't think that is asking for too much.  What a shame."}
{"text":"We agonized, for quite a long time, over which dim sum restaurant to visit on a recent visit to Toronto. We ruled out some of the pricier and higher end options, wanting a more basic (and honestly affordable) experience. Making that decision was tough; everyone had an opinion.   Usually those opinions seemed to come back to whether or not a location was better or worse than Rol San. So we decided to just bite the bullet, trust the wisdom of the crowd, and visit the place that everyone seemed to be using as a benchmark.   We were thoroughly pleased with our choice.   I have no doubt that there are better dim sum restaurants. But having had dim sum in a variety of cities, Rol San was as good or better than most that I have had. The staple dishes, like shiu mai and har gow were more flavorful and had more nuanced flavor than many that I've had.   And while I was put off at first by the absence of a cart, the fact that the dim sum was made to order meant that it came out hotter and fresher than I've experienced in most places.   The downside of the menu ordering process however is that it deprived us a little bit of the sense of discovery. With no pictures, and nothing to point to as it rolled by our table, we didn't venture too far outside of the usual dim sum staples. And while we certainly had plenty to eat, I wouldn't have minded trying something new and different. (But really we could have, our ordering was on us at the end of the day.)"}
{"text":"Rol San is located in the heart of Chinatown. You do not come here expecting great service or amazing ambiance. Rol San is known for its affordable dim sum (and Chinese food). The restaurant looks a little run down. The tables are covered in plastic sheets for easy cleaning and turnover.  The food is not bad. It is not the best, but then again you are not paying top dollar - so you get what you pay for. The service is quick and efficient. Rol San is consistently busy on the weekends as it is one of the better dim sum places in Chinatown."}
{"text":"This place was great for dim sum! You get to order everything so your food comes out piping hot instead of food being carted around for who knows how long. Only downside to that is that you can't see stuff you may want to try before ordering it.  Service was fast and the food was good, so check it out."}
{"text":"First tried Rol San when I was looking for a dim sum place that opened early. This did not disappoint.  It gets very busy very quickly on weekends. I've waited 30+ minutes for a table of 2. But it's always been worth the wait.  Ordering from the menu instead of carts means everything was delivered fresh. Dim sum mainstays (har gao, shiu mai etc) hit the spot. The taro puffs are delightful. The sticky rice comes personal sized, which was both adorable and appreciated. Out of the dozen or so dishes ordered on our most recent visit, only the curried cuttlefish and the tripe weren't a hit with our table.  Note that although they serve dim sum all day, the menu changes (and shrinks) mid-afternoon - go for brunch or lunch for the full experience.    And yes, they only accept cash or Visa. Which is odd. So grab cash ahead of time."}
{"text":"Rol San has always been my go-to place downtown for Dim Sum. Just make sure u make reservations or you'll be waiting for a while!!!"}
{"text":"Saw the superior reviews and tried to come here instead of Sky Dragon, but Rol San's got a sign on the door that says they only accept cash and Visa. And there's a $20 minimum on Visa (not that that would have been a problem for us).  So it's a little misleading to suggest they accept credit and debit. Not the end of the world, but a heads-up for anyone who might plan on eating here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite dim sum place. Most items are addictively delicious. The few vegetarian options are my least favorite. Anything with shrimp in it is delicious. And I am not a huge shrimp fan. Actually I only like shrimp the way Rol San does it. Steamed shrimp dumplings are a must. Eggplant stuffed with shrimp is my favorite.   Con: I have a suspicion that the shrimp is extra good because they flavor/ cook it with meat broth (beef or pork maybe?) So if you have dietary restrictions you may not be able to eat much here. Also, there is shrimp in many of the dishes so if you absolutely hate shrimp you will be limited."}
{"text":"May I say, Rol San's dim sums are as authentic as the ones you can get in Hong Kong (this is a great compliment as I grew up in Hong Kong and was in a dim sum restaurant twice a wk for 20+ years). All types of dim sums are on an order sheet. So, we can choose what we want without dealing with the pressure given the stuff pushing the dim sum carts. Because of the amount of customers, most dim sums are freshly steamed and hot! Temperature is the key to deliciousness. Must tries: Steamed pork dumplings (??), steamed squid (???), and sticky rice pastry (???)!!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but dim sum is definitely better uptown and cheaper too. They have all your standard items like ha gow, Sui mai, turnip cake, BBQ bun etc. But the prices are higher and taste was average. Nothing really stood out for me but it is a decent dim sum place for downtown.   It is really crowded on the weekends!"}
{"text":"BEST dim sim hands down in the city, at least to me! Maybe I'm just used to Montreal dim sum where it's really medicore to below mediocre, and makes Rol San shine triple fold. But anyhow, I really just find the quality of everything from the hargow, siu mai, cheun feng, turnip cakes, tripe etc etc to be so tasty My favorite is the cheun feng which is the shrimp rolls with the sweet ish tasting soy sauce, and also the crispy dumpling/wonton that comes with some sort of mayo sauce.  The beauty of this restaurant is, you get dim sum...ALL DAY. That's right, you can have it anyyyy time of the day you want. But the cheun feng is almost never available if you try to order it for dinner time. So if that is one of your fav go to dishes, I suggest eating at rol san for brunch.   I highly recommend trying the dim sum here. I refuse to go anywhere else. Rol San, or nothing."}
{"text":"I am a normal customer here. Food is good but service is really bad. One of the customer confronted the server (he normally work at the back room..the guy with the glasses) on taking extra charge on the bill for tip. And the old lady server (she normally ware the green vest) keep taking tips on the side. That's the only time she will bring you water or come by to check on you. I would give me zero star if it is for the food. If you don't care for service, this is the place you should come. They do have the best food. But over time, I am very disappointed with service in this place"}
{"text":"Read this review with the pretence that I am a dim sum novice! I have read some of the reviews re Rol San and I had a completely different experience. A group of friends and I visited on a Saturday for Dim Sum brunch...group of 7. We had some pretty decent dim sum...I wasn't a fan of the beef short ribs as they were a bit fatty but the dumplings, sticky rice, buns, squid were all really tasty. Curried cuttle fish were ok but needed a stronger curry base imo.   Food came out hot hot hot and pretty fast. Service was fine, waiting staff friendy and attentive even though the place was extremely busy. Overall I liked it enough that I will return"}
{"text":"Quality Dim Sum served here at Rol San. I've been a patron ever since the beginning of undergrad so it's been 5 or so years. Things have remained pretty consistant.  Everything has always been tasty and satisfying. They have the classics like har gow, shu mai, and bbq buns. Squid tentacles, chickens feet, black bean spare ribs and shrimp in rice rolls are also traditional.  I like the fried shrimp dumplings with salad sauce (miracle whip) and har gow the most. They do both very well here, they don't skimp on the filling or portions.   I can't complain about at Rol San, just that it's always full on Sunday and it's a 20 minute wait on average. Come a little less hungry below starving, you'll reach that point when you get seated. Teapots are accidents ready to happen, it takes technique."}
{"text":"To me one of the best fried rice in Toronto, I keep coming back for more!! Can't go wrong with the Dim Sum options.  I particularly like their Egg Fu Yung."}
{"text":"Fried rice had no taste, (boiled)rice with a scent of soy sauce...egg roll was dry...sweet sour chicken was so so... Would not go back, food had no flavor?  What happened to the good Chinese restaurants?  BlogTO dismal ratings for restaurants."}
{"text":"The service is worst than terrible!!  Our bill was not explained properly!.  Never going back again!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great and the food isn't really the issue but the staff. They are insanely rude and would ignore you on purpose! I tried to order something and get the worker's attention they would make eye contact with me and pretend to not notice after! Everyone that works here looks like they want to murder someone, and they are constantly yelling even infront of their customers.   When I paid the bill they obviously added the tip onto my bill so I paid the exact amount and they came up to me and lied that the tip is not actually included. Its shady because on the bill it said tip % included and the bill was more than it should be! They basically made me pay extra tip and scammed me."}
{"text":"The food at Rol San was delicious. Fresh and comes out hot and the drinks are cold!!  The presentation was great!  My husband is a vegetarian and he had many dim sum options and he told the head waiter, Ben, he wanted noodles and Ben knew exactly what to bring.  I ordered the spare ribs in black bean sauce which came out piping hot and full of flavor. The pan fried beef short ribs were seasoned to perfection.  The meat and shrimp dumplings had lots of flavor. The vegetarian options we ordered were quite tasty. For dessert we ordered coconut red bean cake and sweet mango pudding. You could taste the coconut and you could see the red beans. The mango pudding had bits of mangoes and was delicious!  This place was packed not only with tourists who yelp but many locals were there. Their hours during the week are 9-2 so get there early!  You'll be glad you went!!"}
{"text":"Good cheap dim sum. I wish there was good dim sum in Seattle or the Eastside. It is easy to miss this place as it has a sign buried with other signs. Upon entering, the restaurant is massive. It's deceiving from the outside. All the dishes were passable. Nothing really stood out. They have a dessert speciality which has an egg custard inside a ball. Not sure what it's called, it was pretty good. Their handwriting is hard to read so when we got the bill, we had to call the waiter to verify the amount. Nothing beats Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong that I know of in terms of cheap and superb quality."}
{"text":"Rather fancy prices (up to 5$ a plate) for less than ostensible pretentions!"}
{"text":"How do you invoke \"Will Power\" (as in \"Will\" Shakespeare) in a restaurant review ?  Read on.  In its hectic, halcyon days of yore (think when the band - not The Band, but Guess Who - was playing 'Shakin' All Over'...\"), Rol San was THE eating establishment for authentic Cantonese cuisine in the venerable Spadina strip in Toronto. Every day, pilgrim diners flocked to this little mecca, paid their obeisance, dropped their gold coins, and left shaking their heads and rubbing their bellies with glee.  Thursdays and weekends, the line will often be literally out the door, lunch and dinner, even if it's 20 below outside with a thrashing wind. Soon, the reputation spread, to a point where the hole-in-the-wall expanded - they took on extra space in the back, and STILL the hordes gathered patiently at its door step.  So on a visit to TO last week, we were anxious (and curious) to check out \"House of the Dragon Come Alive\" again.  But oh, what a falling off was there - this \"Hyperion\" has indeed become a satyr.  Rol San used to be great value - that was one of the allures.  Now the word \"gouge\" is well ingrained in their lexicon.  You don't WANT to know what they gouged for the \"market price\" double lobster in ginger and scallion.  But here's the thing - if it tasted half as good as before, I would not begrudge success a few extra pennies of profit.  The food was not bad, but thoroughly ordinary.  The \"crab meat\" fish bladder soup was made with Krab!  The tsuen tsiu chicken was adorned with those deep fried green leaves mysteriously having been chopped up almost into little bits, making them highly grease-retentive.  Equally mystifying was how, in the seafood nest ($14), they cut what were pretty good size shrimps into three pieces, making for a horrible presentation - the shrimps and the entire dish looked scrooge-y when brought to the table.  Most of the dishes were almost indelicate, amateurish attempts compared to the many many lesser-known and less expensive alternatives pretty much in any major neighborhood in Toronto.  So we left shaking our heads, albeit for a different reason; instead of rubbing our bellies, we were rubbing our behinds, where it felt like we've been dealt a swift one."}
{"text":"Rol San is a staple in Chinatown but the food is overrated. Sure it's no frills and the all-day dim sum is a plus but it really doesn't appeal to me. The food is standard if you've been to Asia and experienced dim sum there. My party ordered har gow, siu mai, chicken feet, BBQ pork bun, spring roll, and some side dishes such as kung pao chicken and a pork dish.   Fast service coupled with friendly staff but one thing I want to point out is how the line up is out the door at peak hours during the weekend. The 3 of us waited less than 10 minutes for seats and one thing I noticed is how non-Asians were promptly seated in the back of the restaurant. Didn't even know there were 2 sections (front and back of the resto) until I spoke up after witnessing 5-6 different groups get seated in the back. Hmmmmm.   3 stars. Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum.  Chicken feet, steamed dumplings, seafood dumplings, stuffed crab balls, and more...YUM!  The wait was quite a while, but I understand why (food is delish).    Seat yourself, don't wait for someone else to do so. That's what we did."}
{"text":"Awesome when you want your dim sum fix. A little on the greasy and unhealthy side but that's partly the experience of dim sum. I am used to places where you get to choose from the cart but this is also great because it comes out from the kitchen still steamy. We tried a variety of dumplings and my favourite was the green snow peas. Yummy steamed custard buns and coconut gelatine for dessert."}
{"text":"YES, I wish I had more of this where I live. Awesome DIM SUM. When we got there the place was packed with no tables so they opened up a back room and BOOM, plenty of tables!"}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite as this place can always be counted on for quick service. There was no line up despite it being the long weekend (or maybe it wasn't busy because of the long weekend!) so we were seated right away and in the back section of the restaurant.   I felt like docking one star because they always forget to bring our hot sauce but the food is too good so it's five stars from me :D  It was just me, hubby and the baby so we ordered two dim sum dishes and a small hot and sour soup. Soooo good! Got a beef chow fun and shrimp hargow.   Small hot and sour soup: enough for at least 5-6 small bowl servings. It's the red hot and sour soup (not the brown one they serve at some other Chinese restaurants) more on the sweet and vinaigretty side (which I love) but it was a bit too sweet for my husband. I noticed the taste isn't always consistent here for the hot and sour soup but I personally love the more vinegar-y taste so it doesn't matter too much to me.   The hargow and chow fun are amazing- AS USUAL- so I can't complain about anything at all!  It came out to $20 with tip and tax and we came out full and happy so I'd say that was a small price to pay for some awesome, quick food downtown!"}
{"text":"id say 3.5. great food quality.  seems consistent.  wait times though seemingly long, turnover of tables isnt too bad.  the reason i gave 3 or ideally 3.5, stars is because in comparison to dim sum in markham and richmond hill it doesnt compare.  quality, emvironment for dim sum in markham is so much better..as well staff seemed to handle so much all at onve at this restaurant you almost feel bad for their excessive balencing act.  they need to hire more staff.  no one deserves to work that hard.  the waiters and waitress staff are on top of things and great but they deserve more pacefulness and less stimulation."}
{"text":"This place has great Dim Sum. Mind you it was my first time having Dim Sum, however I really enjoyed it and my experienced friend said it was pretty good stuff.  There is no lady push cart thing, but this is better because you order exactly what you want and it is made fresh.  We ordered a variety of dim sum, such as the shrimp dumplings, pork cakes, etc...  The service was fast and the food piping hot.  Only 4 stars because it drives me insane that they use those cheap grocery bag plastic table clothes."}
{"text":"One star one star one star, I have only given one 1 start until yet. I never rate restaurants according to customer service, because frankly I'm there for the food. But i have to do this, for other Yelpers.   I usually keep my reviews long and interesting to read like what I ordered how it tasted etc etc.   The customer service has 3 levels,   1. Excellent 2. Good 3. Poor  I had the most horrible experience ever. I had a question about the kind of noodles, this waitress who I think was the head waitress, old Chinese lady, with short hair, she was wearing a green jacket, other servers had black jackets.   She told us to read the menu properly, made a very rude face and just walked away. I thought May be sure is having a bad day, I let it go.   The food came, we have a 14 month old, and I'll be honest he made a little mess on the floor, she came and scolded my 14 month old in Mandarin.   Now the best part, while she was doing all this and pointing towards the food on the floor, she tried to STEAL my I PHONE. She picked it up, and started walking away with it, I saw her and she hastily kept it back on the table and just walked away mumbling something.   SHE TRIED TO STEAL MY I PHONE.   Beware beware beware."}
{"text":"Really enjoy their fried calamari. Didn't enjoy their baked milk tart, the pastry dominated the filling."}
{"text":"Great dim sum and great prices. Me and my girlfriend come here once every 1-2 weeks or even more often. The food tastes delicious and comes out fast. As is typical per Chinese restaurants, don't expect great service. With that being said, however, I have noticed some new faces at the restaurant that are always smiling and happy to help. Shrimp and donut rice rolls are a must!  Expect to wait a bit if you come during lunch rush hour, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"AWW - I've been to Rol San before for their regular Chinese menu and was always super happy with it, but I went today for their dim sum, and was really disappointed!  Not only were the shrimps gritty and tasted like they hadn't been washed - the service was terrible!  Now my husband is Taiwanese, so I'm used to talking with in-laws that really have no idea what I'm saying and pretty much only ask me if my hair is real and if they can pull it, but if you're a waiter in a restaurant please at least know the English for things on the menu!  I asked for the steamed pork buns and the girl was like: oh no we no have.   Really? Cause you JUST brought them to the table beside me.   UUUGh. I just wanted some pork :("}
{"text":"Not the best dim sum place I've been to in the GTA. While the food wasnt that great, it definitely is the best in the area. Although prices were average, the service I received broke my experience."}
{"text":"My friend called me up in the morning on January 1st to ask if I was game for dim sum. Salad in my fridge or Chinese food : it was a no brainer so I went for the latter. I was naive and thought that I would be the only Torontonian out at 10:00 AM on New Year's Day; however, I was so wrong! The subway was packed as was the streetcar I rode on along with Rol San. We waited for a good twenty minutes, but it was worth it. Rol San is quite clean compared to some other places in the area. I didn't realize how big this joint was; they have two dining rooms. They don't have the ladies with the carts, but I feel that this is becoming obsolete. Between the two of us we ordered: sticky rice, pork buns, shrimp dumplings, and shrimp rolls ... all for under $20. I can't wait to return with a big group so that I can try more of their dishes.   Good for: dim sum"}
{"text":"Saw this place from the street and it looked busy with lots of locals going in so we decided to eat lunch here while in Chinatown.  With so many choices in the area I am glad we lucked out and decided to come here. We were promptly seated in the back dining room area and given a dim sum check off sheet.  I would have liked pictures or something. I like the dim sum places that roll the carts around but this place was really busy and everybody seemed to know what they wanted anyway.  Taking some time to look things over and see what was coming out of the kitchen we realized quickly that the portion sizes were rather large so in order to try the things we wanted we were going to have left overs. We ordered several dishes and didn't have to wait long before our table was full of food.  Pepper ribs, ribs in bean sauce, noodles, eggplant dish, tripe and fried fish. Everything was great! I didn't eat the trip that was my friends choice but everything else had great flavor, came out really hot and was fresh tasting. The noodles were especially good and had a nice spice to them. I've added a pic of our spread of food.  Service was OK and they seemed to handle a full dining room with efficiency.  If you want fast and good food this is the place."}
{"text":"If you are about the food, 4~5 star.  If you are all about the service, where you like to have your waiter/waitress be attentive, friendly and conversational, don't go... They're quick to seat you, take your order, and serve your dishes.  In that sense, service is good, where there are no delays.  If you are limited on time and want good food, this is the place to go.  One of the better places I've had dim sum and I would go back just for the food.  :)"}
{"text":"I've been trying to hold off on this review as long as possible but I just had to give in after my last visit to Rol Son.  Dim sum is more than just a bunch of dumplings sitting in bamboo steamers.  It's a culinary experience like no other.  On with the review:  +++PROS+++ 1. Everything comes out steamingly fresh 2. Decent quality for downtown dim sum 3. Bathroom is not haunted (see Bright Pearl) 4. No visible mice droppings, which is always a plus for any restaurant in Chinatown  ---CONS--- 1. You order off the menu.  A big part of the dim sum experience is to see those old Chinese ladies wheeling around those dim sum carts barking \"ha gow! shui mai!\".   You don't get this here. 2. No fear.  Part of the real dim sum experience is the fear that the dish you really want to eat won't actually be available when you go.  Ordering off a menu eliminates this fear. 3. No fried taro balls - blasphemy!  My favorite dim sum dish isn't even served here!  The menu is a bit limited as well. 4. Too many whiteys.  There's a lot of gwai los that come to this place, which makes me think that the old Chinese couples are dining it up at another finer dim sum establishment.  But where are they?  5. Busy, long waits.  Don't show up during prime dim sum hours expecting a table in anything less than 20 minutes.  Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is good for dim sum.  The price is reasonable, the food quality is good and the service is good too. The seating although can be tight is still relatively comfortable compared to a lot of other chinese restaurant in china town."}
{"text":"I would have walked past this place 100 times and not gone in - thanks to a recommendation from a friend, we ate like kings! The food was unique, fast, fresh and very reasonable. The place was very busy (in a good way) and the service was very friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I can only attest to my own personal experience with the five or six dimsum dishes and the pea shoot stir fry that I've tried but everything was pretty good. A little on the salty side, maybe.  The ha-gao was pretty good, especially slathered with red vinegar, which was ultra diluted down but worked for me since they didn't bring me a sauce dish and I just ended up using my plate. Stuffed with shrimp and the wrapper didn't break at first touch. The shumai had plump fish eggs on it, making it look ultra delicious, but in reality was a little on the salty side. And it was super juicy! Which was great. The bbq pork steamed buns were good and apparently a THING in Toronto, or Rolsan, don't know which~ but by far the steamed custard bun was waaY better. I will admit, the bun was a tiny bit tougher than I like it to be, but I'll take it.  The spare ribs, or short ribs, or something... was alright. But there were others in my party LoVEd it. A little on the tough side and I was not in the mood to use my hands.  And we had another dumpling but I have no idea what it was and it was mediocre. Too mushy. The peashoot stir fry came out way too soon in comparison to the dimsum we ordered, but I guess it was good we had some food early since some of us were pretty hungry. Overall, good dinner. I have no complaints about this having been my birthday dinner. My 30th birthday dinner at that.  Next time, I'll try the duck."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Four words: All day dim sum!!!  My friend recommended this place and I also heard about it from a travel YouTuber that I follow as well. This is not your typical dim sum place where they have the push carts. They give you a menu card and you would mark down what you want. There are about 54 dishes to choose from and you can refer to my Yelp photo for the menu. The food took a while to come out since everything is made/steamed to order.  We got seven dishes: 1) Steamed BBQ Pork Bun- Recommend. It's a soft dough bun with roast pork filling. 2) Shrimp Dumpling (Har Gow)- Recommend 3) Sticky Rice with Pork Meat in Lotus Leaf- Recommend. They give you 2 pieces. It's very filling. 4) Fried Eggplant with Stuffed Shrimp Paste in Soy Sauce- Recommend. The dish came out piping hot. 5) Shrimp Rice Rolls- Recommend 6) Chicken Feet Chef Sauce- It was OK and I think they used the roast pork seasoning since the chicken feet was in a reddish color. But, the chicken feet was cooked pretty well and meat falls of the bone. 7) Beef Tripe with Ginger & Scallion- Recommend  We paid about $32 CAD (including tax & tip). Good value and we did get a lot of food. The service was alright. The waiter was a bit rude in the beginning. But, I'll still return one day when I'm in Toronto since the food was pretty good. I also like that I could come here any time of the day for dim sum too!"}
{"text":"Very rude service. Ignored on arrival for more than 10 min, then waived to sit, without any word of how long. Another long wait.  Once at table, ignored again for a long time, with servers walking by but not stopping or acknowledging us. We might never have been able to order if another diner noticed our plight and sent a server over. Then all the food came at once, with one wrong dish, but servers didn't stop long enough for us to tell them. Same treatment when we were ready to pay and leave. We had to go up to the register with our coats on before someone handed us a bill. I don't know how they stay in business - the food is ok but not worth that treatment."}
{"text":"Came here for the food but was utterly disappointed by the service. The waitress literally snatched the ordering sheet from my hands while I was folding it just so she could confirm the order, without saying anything. My friend found blood in her food and so we left a smaller tip than usual.  Bad move. Our waiter and another lady working there came up to our table and yelled at us to go eat at a food court if we won't tip more than 10%. The waiter then harassed us to give him $2 more but we refused to because the service was bad and they wouldn't stop harassing us because our tip was lacking 47 cents."}
{"text":"Came here for a late night craving of dim sum, place was still pretty busy considering the time. We were seated promptly, and were given tea along with the menu. Sadly, they do not tell you that tea is 1.00 (?) per person. They didn't even ask if we wanted it they just assumed which I didn't like. They also did not have any of the classic dim sum dishes either- (no rice rolls, no shrimp dumplings...) which really sucks because those are a must wherever you go. So we ended up ordering a variety of things, prices were really jacked up at this point. But the food came promptly and the taste was very good. I particularly enjoyed their soup dumpling, more then I expected to. It isn't your typical soup dumpling... it's a giant soup dumpling!  Overall, I'd come back here if this was the only place opened for dim sum but knowing that they don't have my favourite dishes I might as well look for somewhere else to eat. Prices are higher during the night -as expected. But don't expect all of your dishes to be available, the menu was pretty small to pick from."}
{"text":"Great dim sum! Second time I've tried it! First time, friends from Buffalo told me about it, and we went on New Year's Day.  Everywhere else in Toronto was asleep, but this place was absolutely packed! I enjoyed it even more the second time, and brought my sister, and two friends who don't eat seafood or pork.  I was a little worried, but shouldn't have.  They had a lot of variety, I was able to actually order a variety of dishes off the dim sum menu.  Piping hot dishes, nice and fresh!  I found it easier to circle what dishes I wanted while I was waiting, and then just give the waiter/tress the sheet.  They're quite busy - so it was a little hard to get their attention for glasses of water, and the bill.  Worth it, though.  Will be sure to eat here again the next time we're here in downtown Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Late night dim sum - check Plastic table cloth - check Average service - check  I had a pretty good experience here.  Bright Pearl was closed, so we just walked across the street to this joint.  I'm a fan of any place serving dim sum late, so there's a win right there.  In a city with 5-6 different Chinatowns, It's pretty much your run-of-the-mill restaurant for chinese food.    We got full on $20, it's pretty cheap. Not the most righteous food I've ever had, but I was glad for late night dim sum that wasn't terrible.  The siu mai, the buns, the dumplings, all solid offerings.  Staff was friendly, but slow at times.   Pretty boring review."}
{"text":"While the food is not especially bad, it's not as good as some of the other dim sum places just down the block on Dundas. The shrimp dumplings were a bit stiff and rubbery, and the skin was too soggy. I don't understand the huge lineups during weekends; it's not worth the wait. The inside is crowded and dark, and service is a little spotty. Again, Rol San is not terrible, but given better choices close by for similar prices, I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and overall, the experience was good. I recommend it if you don't care much for service.   Food: 4/5, we got bunch of food but the deep fried items were the best and the leaf wrapped rice. The steam did make a lot of the dim sum to stick.  Service: 2/5, they are very hard to get a hold of and they forgot one of the items and we will like we got charged a little more than what we ordered. They should really have the list and check off each item as it comes like the restaurants in markham.  Ambience: 2/5, it's just really loud and people walking everywhere. I wish they would leave some space.  Price: 3/5, $2.88 for small, $3.68 for medium and $4.88 for large and most are large.  About $20 per person."}
{"text":"Okay i came here sooo many times I need to write something about it.   Sat/Sun brunch before 11 am, be there! okay everything is delish and super fresh, i've taken many friends here, i've taken my parents here, and I just visit here randomly cuz I love the dimsum in this place.   Honestly order anything - from chicken feet to har gow, from banboo bean wrap to calamari. this place's got it all.  one side of warning: sesame balls are very hot! don't burn yourself."}
{"text":"Ha ha...it is the Seinfeld soup nazi experience, but the dim sum is mediocre.  You just can't take offence to this behaviour. I've tried something new while eating out at rude Chinese joints, just play with them.  Just continue with your conversation when they throw food at you. Since service doesn't exist, the server's existence is inconsequential. I'm only upset that the food wasn't awesome to justify spending almost two hours of my Saturday in a dingy hole."}
{"text":"Landed in Toronto and came straight here.  Yes, we were very hungry and yes, this restaurant hit the sweet spot with us.  No waiting, eating within 5 minutes of turning in our order.  The dim sum pieces were larger than I've had elsewhere.  The flavors were exceptional and the service was good.  Would recommend Rol San for anyone interested in good food without the frills."}
{"text":"Cash only-They do accept credit card but it's kind of bullshit that they only accept VISA. They also round up the bill so don't worry too much about tipping unless their service blows you the eff away"}
{"text":"I have been going to Rol San for over 17 years now. I've seen them go through their renovations and upgrades. The prices for their dim sum is slightly higher than what you would find at other traditional dim sum restaurants, but their portion sizes are a lot bigger as well. Prices have gone up lately costing almost $4 for 4 Har Gow shrimp dumplings. They are always jam packed on the weekends. So come early and be prepared to wait. Occasionally they get our order wrong where they miss a dish completely and then we get changed for it. It's happened so many times that we know to check and keep a count on how many dishes we have ordered. For example, if you order a bowl of steamed rice and for some reason did not receive it even asking 3 different servers, keep a look out for that extra $1.50 charge on your bill. Since they have recently gained more popularity they are unable to keep up with their standards since they are so busy. There are other dim locations in Chinatown if you are looking for cheaper eats."}
{"text":"Vivek S - you're a genius! Usually, I like the tradition of seeing what I'm going to eat: steaming carts, trays and the like, but the order by number suited us find. Plus, truth be told, I think we ended up ordering way more than we would have had we seen our food first, which gives way to the obvious: getting to try dishes!  It's uncomplicated and traditional dim sum. There were a number of hits, and a couple of misses - like limp rice noodle wrapped donuts - but that's what a culinary adventure is all about. Who knew I'd actually like cuttlefish?   My craving for har gaw satiated, we moseyed on into Moonbeam where we proceeded to share a little sphere of food heaven (sesame balls) with another coffee connoisseur hanging in our self-dubbed \"Mac\" corner."}
{"text":"This is the favourite dim sum joint of some of my good friends, so I have eaten there quite a few times.  It's still the best dim sum I've had, but I can't help but feel like there's much more, and much better, out there.  Everything here is tasty, the service is great, and the lightning quick table cleanup (thanks to tear away plastic covers) is certainly a cool novelty, but again, the food's just... good.  Cheap, quick, and good.    Of particular note, the turnip cakes are divine -- if you go, you must order them.  Delish!  Outside of that, however, the dim sum menu is a bit limited and, after a half dozen times or so, I feel like I've exhausted my enjoyment of it.  Time to explore the wide world of Toronto dim sum beyond Rol San!"}
{"text":"Pretty good.  Kind of a solid 3-star. The service is pretty crapola with a token smile. A sweet family came in asking for a high chair and they got told they had run out... but with a really big smile. It's all good, there are barbequed pork buns to be served!  (Plus, I don't even think the management cares much if you tip $5 or $0.05 anyway). Food was alright, super fresh, nice and hot, but nothing out of the ordinary from any other dim sum spot I've been to. The turnover is really fast though. I came looking for a table for 2, and within about 5 minutes I was parked beside some randoms.  Within about 8.5 minutes, food I had ordered 30 seconds prior was already in front of me. Good eats, cheap, zero service, fresh shiu mai, no obvious mystery meat, no complaints."}
{"text":"The food was okay. The server was very nice. But once we went to pay, turns out there is No Amex,  No Debit, No Mastercard, No ATM and a $20 minimum for using your Visa. Also there is not signage or menu notes about this so you don't know until your already finished. I know Chinatown doesn't have the best payment options, but this place is particularly insane. In addition to this, they added a gratuity to my bill, which I didn't actually realize until I had left. No mention of an auto gratuity ever, and it wasn't even a large group."}
{"text":"Holy shit this place is good! Thank you Rol San for reminding me what GOOD dim sum tastes like. Yank Sing in SF? It can suck it! And not only the food heavenly, it is CHEAP. My friend and I got stuffed and our check was $22.   And you'd think a cheap, affordable restaurant would be pretty ghetto. Well the front room is rather bare and dull, but the back room is quite colorful and actually has some artistic posters on the walls. So yeah, this restaurant rocks in pretty much every way.   That being said, do NOT get the egg plant/shrimp dish. It was quite bland and dull. It was the only subpar food we had here. Everything else here is top notch."}
{"text":"The food is spectacular. Lived most everything we ordered.  The service? Slow, apathetic, and not at all friendly. Be aggressive when ordering as needed.   Of the food want so good, I'd never come back."}
{"text":"The food was good.   Here's where things went downhill for us. It took about 25 min for food to finally arrive at our table - this was because our waitress messed up on the order sheets. She was supposed to give us back a copy of our order for reference while the staff has another copy so that they can process our order. Fine. We had to wait a bit because of a mix up. I found it a bit sketchy that they did not circle or otherwise mark down what foods they've served as we were eating. I wish I had read the reviews regarding the scams that this place supposedly has pulled off properly prior to coming here. Fortunately for us, we were not overcharged for anything.  The thing that really pissed me off was when it came to the bill. The same waitress had the audacity to come up to me and ask me to give her a tip. WHO DOES THAT!? I don't care if you're not from Canada. You should know better NOT to harass customers for tips. She even had to crouch right next to me to ask. I was counting the change when she asked me to tip her. I wish I did not tip her because I did...and the only reason I did was because the food was good and because I knew that tip will go to the kitchen and to the bus boy (who did his job properly). When I told my boyfriend what happened with the waitress when we left (I was speaking to the woman in Cantonese the whole time), he told me that his brother has apparently experienced the same thing with bills at this restaurant (and likely with the same waitress).   If you have to come to Rol San, beware of a short-haired waitress wearing the white blouse and vest uniform (not purple polo shirts like some of the other staff were wearing). She will likely mess up your orders and then ask to be tipped."}
{"text":"Good dim sum, fast service, fresh food.   There were a lot of people jammed into the entrance on a Sunday morning and very little communication on what to do. I fought my way inside and asked if I needed a number, to which the lady asked how many were in my party and sent me to the back. Looking around, it looks like they have smaller parties go to the back room while larger tables are in the front. Not bad I guess but wish we knew that going in instead of wasting time in the first line.   Food wise, I liked Rol San enough during my trip. I've very much used to the dim sum flavors of Boston, and these were good but not as great. Flavor was maybe 75% there, and just needed a touch more help.   We ordered 10 items and they came as soon as they were finished cooking. We sat in the back and were able to watch the food come out. Unlike the States where dim sum is pushed in carts, this is made to order. It's wicked hot when it hits your table and it not overcooked after sitting in a stem push cart, which I appreciated.   The tables are lined with layers plastic sheets for easy clean up (they scope up all of the dishes in the plastic after your done and are ready for the next service - genius!). They do charge for tea and put it down right away so if you don't want it, tell them ASAP. I will also throw in that dim sum is customarily eaten with tea to help with the oils in the food, and I recommend keeping it.   I don't know if I'd readily come back, but if I was in the area and someone wanted to eat here, I wouldn't be opposed."}
{"text":"Solid dim sum. Prices are a bit high but portions are nice. Service is a bit brusk and you have for things like tea or water which should just come out right away."}
{"text":"My opinion of Rol San hasn't changed, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I was just there over the weekend and the quality of the dim sum, level of service and prices have pretty much remained the same.  BBQ and apple pastry is still my favourite."}
{"text":"The food for me is pretty good and m addicted, even though m vegetarian... the only issue I have is with customer service... last time the servers started eating their dinner while we were there for dinner... and the food being spicy we weren't served water...so we asked for it and none of them got up or bothered about serving water... so we decided to leave and didn't tip... one of the server asked us why we didn't tip and when we explained his reply was, \"no tip, don't come back again\".. after that I have never been there for dine in.. but the food is addictive and I end up with take away..   This time the lady was nice, food was good, only issue they didn't give me their chilli... but I still love the food!"}
{"text":"We came to Rol San one weekend because I had a desperate craving for dimsum. Back then, we had moved to Toronto and we didnt know where to look so we decided to give this place a try.   First, the wait was over 30 minutes, cramped in a little corner, with people entering via both front and back doors (they had two entrances and two lines and two rooms??!!). The whole thing was very confusing.   Food wise, nothing really stood out in the menu, we just went for the staple dimsum fares. Overall, we weren't impressed with the quality, everything was very oily (we didn't even order friend food). The price per dish also rivals with the price of higher end dimsum places which I have trouble understanding why..."}
{"text":"As a kid growing up in the GTA our family would go out for dim sum once a week. It was tradition.  As an adult it's been years since I've had dim sum.   I was looking forward to going to Rol San, both because of the reviews and my craving for those little bamboo containers of steamed goodness.   Rol San is as traditional as it gets when it comes to dim sum. All the regular standards are there on the menu with little in 'new' variations.  Most dishes were on the shy side for fillings. Har gow and cheung fun could have had a bit more shrimp, etc but overall quality of food is fine, not great, but comfortingly edible.    Pricing is average. Service good (though I was disappointed they forgot our deep fried taro with stuffed pork dumplings), establishment clean (for Ctown)."}
{"text":"The dim sum is one of the best in towns. The service is good, and the place is clean relative to other restaurant in Chinatown.  I don't have anything specific to recommend, you can just try different dim sum at each visits. I believe you will come back. The hours are very flexible, they are open for lunch and at 3 am. They say they don't take debit, but visa. I doubt about this, FYI they actually take debit, if you don't have visa with you. : )"}
{"text":"Best shumai I've ever had, parking at the corner of spadina and dundas, large back room, excellent service, awesome glutinous sweet dumplings with pork inside. Everything was great from all the dim sum and then sum. My folks in the Toronto area recommended this place and they were right on target. I stayed away from the chicken feet because you never know where they've been stepping. Cheers."}
{"text":"Some of the best dim sum I've ever eaten. Everything is moist and tender and flavorful and I wish I could teleport this whole restaurant back to Seattle.   They got pretty rattled when we tried to add an additional sticky rice to our order, first bringing us a sprite, then a bowl of plain rice, then sticky rice about 15 minutes later, but it was crazy busy in there, so I wasn't bent out of shape about it. We were too blissed out after eating most of our meal to lose our patience."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday and it was a long wait for a table for two. Service was fast and efficient. Ordered 7 items, received 6/7 and we ate it under 30 minutes. Hostess comes over and orders her employee to give us the bill as we are done, but we corrected her and let her know our 7th item has not arrived yet. Hostess snaps back at us and says it's none of our business what she tells her employee to do, we tell her it is our business if we're paying for something we haven't received, she doesn't care and ignores us. We eventually finish and go to pay the bill with the owner, told the owner what happened and that she shouldn't treat customers like that. Owner laughs at us and doesn't comment. I get that the place is packed and they want to move people in and out as fast as possible but we weren't even there for very long, and the experience and taste was OK until the very end when the nasty hostess and the nonchalant owner left a bad taste in our mouths. Rol San is VERY LUCKY to have the customer base they have, any restaurant would dream to be this busy, but unfortunately their customer service is poor and we won't be coming back. Not worth it to eat average dim sum here with terrible customer service. No apologies just a laugh."}
{"text":"Tasty!! Tasty! Never disappoints.. Always fresh. I have been coming too this spot for as long as I could remember. Always friendly and fast service. Try the shrimp chive cakes... You'll be sorry if you miss those babies"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Toronto dim sum because I heard great things but I was sorely disappointed. This place serves all day dim sum which sounds cool but I like the experience of the cart. I'm not Chinese or that knowledgable of dim sum items so reading the menu didn't really help me figure out what to order.  We got the standard shu Mai and har gow. Both were probably the best things here. The Shu Mai was a bit pink inside so that was weird... The shrimp noodle crepe fell a little short for me. The rice noodle wrap was super thick and it had like 2 shrimp in them.  I was really put off with how pink the beef meatballs were. If we saw these on the cart, we wouldn't have ordered them.  The dessert dim sum were not as good as I usually eat. We got the milk tarts and the black sesame filled balls. The milk tart's crust was super thick and I prefer egg tart filling way more than milk filling. We also preferred red bean paste in our sesame balls and the black sesame was not good... It's sad that I much prefer dim sum from Maryland than to here!"}
{"text":"Thanks Neil T for the invite for dim sum today. Also thanks to Susan for arriving early and snagging a table, thereby allowing us to sidestep the very loong line!  Maybe I just missed the spectacle, but I prefer dim sum with the carts. No idea if it's more authentic, but it's certainly more fun! Without the carts, it's just another restaurant, and in this case, it didn't speed up the service any!  Good food, though. While I didn't like the tripe's icky texture, I did try the chicken feet. Better than I thought! Tastes like chicken! I know..groan!  The shrimp dumplings and fried squid were really good. And the turnip cake!  All in all, very filling for $13 each.  Yea, so no carts, slow service. Oh yea! The bathroom was cold, too bright and uncomfortable. Plus, they had a Costco-big sized container of soap. It was weird. Something new in a restaurant bathroom. Something new and not alive. Is that +1 or -1 star?   So 3 stars. I've had better dim sum, no carts, and very slow service. Also the girl never gave me another dish of hot sauce, but Neil T did say something to her, so maybe he told her not to bring it? Just kidding, Neil. I blame the waitress."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was fast even during the lunch rush. Will come back again when next in area."}
{"text":"Our goto place for downtown dim sum, food is great and reasonably priced. Most recently we had an incident where someone walked by our table and accidentally knocked over our dish on to the floor and after explaining the incident to one of the servers the server replaced the dish with a full order even though we were almost finished with it. I'm happy with how this situation was handled and it was great service on their part so I recommend Rol San and will continue to be going here if I am downtown and in the mood for dim sum."}
{"text":"Weekly customer of 18 years, and will no longer be returning. The service has gone downhill since the manager of many years left. Frequently my order is wrong, and the service is flat out rude. Food is good when it's correct, but your experience will no longer match the old reviews."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum. Just wish they had a few greens on their dim sum menu like other restaurants we have been ti"}
{"text":"This Yum Cha place is legit! The dim sum served is so comparable to the top-notch dim sum places in Hong Kong.  We ordered the following dishes: - Century Egg Congee - tasty, unlike most congees which are just bland. - Shiu Maai - they were HUGE and succulent and juicy! Almost the perfect shiu maai! Only if I could have 5 of them in a meal. - Buddha chow fan - veggie alternative of the typical shrimp chow fan - delicious! - Fried Turnip Cakes - the cakes had chunks of smoked sausages in them - best turnip cakes ever eaten in my life! - Shrimp dumplings - TWO GIGANTIC SHRIMPS basking in a chicken-flavoured gravy! I don't think I have encountered haa gao containing more than 1 shrimp in life before! - Chicken's feet - I am not a big fan of this dish and so did not try any. My friend who ate the entire platter said they were really good.  Dim Sum fans, this place is a must-visit!"}
{"text":"We lucked out and arrived before 11:00am when things get really busy. The service was excellent, hot sauce, tea and water all promptly arrived upon seating. Everything came out hot and delicious in a reasonable amount of time. The only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because my gf thought she had better."}
{"text":"Dimsum is always delicious. But WARNING: make sure you take a picture of your order sheet before you give them the order. Of the 3/5 times I've been there, they gave us the bill with an average of $5 added onto our bill. When confronting them about the wrong calculation, they would give the bill back right away with the correct amount as if they knew what the correct amount was all along. I can't hate on the food, but the frustration with them jacking up the prices is just wrong."}
{"text":"My go-to dim sum place  (1/1) Price vs portion  (2/2) Taste + food presentation  - right amount of seasoning, not too salty or bland - steaming food - just what you expect for the money - good desert   (0.5/1)  ambiance + customer service - quick  - no rush - some servers are courteous but some are not - old and shabby, some modern renovations would be nice  (0.5/1) Wow factor - Consistent positive experience, not \"wow\" enough for full point  Recommendation for a good experience:  - Tip as you would in non-Asian restaurants - Bring cash and ask for paying in cash - Good for group"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend of mine for dinner after an exam. We had dim sum there- deep fried squid tentacles, some shrimp dishes, assorted dumplings- along with one of the mains. Admittedly, I haven't done deep fried in a while and realized immediately that I'm definitely not a fan, but all of the food we had was pretty greasy and unappealing. Service was meh. Overall, a somewhat negative experience."}
{"text":"Let's be honest.... Most of you have been here after a long night of adult beveraging and exercising at the local clubs. This place has become a TO landmark for late night munchies at is open till very late. The first few things you will notice about this spot when you walk in at night is that 1) it is crowded as all hell 2) it smells and looks kinda dirty. This place could seriously use a scrubbing but I only noticed this when I came here the last time and I was dead sober. The three or four times I came prior to this, I could not tell how clean this place was and it looked like a piece of heaven.   The service is a little less than average even for a Chinese restaurant. While I find the \"no cart\" concept interesting sometimes it is just easy to see the quality of the food as it is rolling around on the cart. All of the food is just OK but nothing really special. There is no doubt that the cost of the food is extremely cheap as my friend and I ordered a bunch of plates and it all came out to a very cheap price. There was nothing really memorable about the food but nothing that made me cringe either hence the \"OK\" rating. Maybe I am spoiled with great dimsum in the bay area but this place could not just stack up against places I had been to which is a shame because TO is so famous for great dimsum. Definitely a spot I would be more inclined to go to when I am a bit high on life after a long night of beverages."}
{"text":"This place was pretty average compared to dim sum places I've experienced.  I've had way better Dim Sum from Los Angeles, Vancouver, Hong kong, to San Francisco...   At least the Siu-mai here was decent and the egg-white dan tats (egg tarts) were pretty tasty.  Otherwise, if you're looking for special dim sum, this place isn't it.  3 stars."}
{"text":"I've been eating dim sum since I was a child. It was my family's classic sunday 'brunch' every weekend. With that being said, rol-san is straight middle of the road dim-sum.  I used to love the place in college because first of all it's open till 4am and when one is out that late, tastes are usually not so discriminating for obvious reasons. The price is really cheap too so I couldn't really complain. There usually is a wait but for the most part it goes by fast.  It was when we started coming here for lunch that I noticed it really wasn't the best. Honestly I don't have much to say about this place, I've tried a huge variety of dishes, none of them were spectacularly bad,  but the food quality was a bit low. I usually felt pretty gross after (though I have to admit you could do a lot worse in chinatown).  Good place to go to late-night and on the cheap.  Would I return? Meh. There are a couple of better options in the city (even though everyone knows the GTA is really the best place to get dim sum)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, not the greatest atmosphere, bit bright and servers were a touch abrupt. But the food was solid!"}
{"text":"If you are into dumplings and dim sum. This is a must go. Ambience is okay but its a must go for the food & service."}
{"text":"Prices are very, very competitive for dimsum here and their food all comes out steaming hot and very quickly. You're also expected to eat relatively quickly then leave - this isn't a place to chat and linger for long. Service is okay, although staff can seem quite rude. Their food is okay, but still a long way behind the dimsum you'd find uptown in Scarborough/Markham/Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Rol San was listed in many \"best of\" lists for Dim Sum in Toronto because of its value.  Nothing on the menu is over $3.50 for a portion, and the quality is quite good at that price level.  While this probably won't be the best dim sum you've ever had if you are a connoisseur, this is perfectly fine for the vast majority of eaters.    Service was quick, seating is plentiful, and there are no dim sum carts.  You fill out a list, as though you were ordering sushi.  Items arrive in shifts from the kitchen -- and you never know when you'll get something!  Our dessert arrived in the middle of the meal, but who cares!  It's fun!    Siu Mai was excellent, as was the crab and chicken soup dumpling.  We did not order anything exotic, and what we saw on other tables and the smiles on other diners' faces convinced me that pretty much everything is above average here.    Not the highest food quality but still a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  If you are confused by the many offerings in Chinatown, give Rol San a try -- I doubt you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I am Chinese and have grown up on Chinese food, particularly dim sum.  The food here is decent. It's not drop dead amazing by any means, but when you're craving dim sum, it's a good place to go. It's authentic and yummy, so what more do you really need?  The service and atmosphere is what you would expect too: it's loud, there's plastic on the tables, very little decor, and the servers are rushed and speak in broken English. So basically, it's a typical Chinese restaurant. I know it might turn off people who aren't used to it, but I would expect nothing else.  I've gone a few times and will return, as always."}
{"text":"Not the best dim sum in Toronto but certainly full of options. The service is quick and the prices are very reasonable ($2-4 per order of 3-4 dumpling pieces). There is often a line of tourists to get a table so other places in the area without a line may be a better bet. If you order off the regular menu, the portions are huge and should be shared by 2-3 people."}
{"text":"The perpetually hanging \"We Serve Dim Sum\" banner neglects to tell diner they do it all day and all night long. Absolutely nice to know when you're craving some siu mai, deep fried squid tentacles or turnip cake at [whatever time it is right now]. Also nice to know: maybe don't eat here after midnight if you hate the idea of being around hungry hungover clubbers and hipsters who know where to get their late-night downtown munchies.  But why not? Rol San dishes out some steamy and tasty quality food that makes it one of the rare can't-go-wrong choices for Chinatown dining, something I have come to usually otherwise avoid. Table service dim sum done on tables clothed with those layers of white plastic tablecloths (do I need to explain why?) so typical of Chinese restaurants like this one it's practically nostalgic.   The service is quick and spartan, only attentive when called for (kinda sadly typical also of most Chinese diners). The siu mai are spot-on juicy hot and big, alongside a mix of delicious dim sum and other Chinese options from an order sheet menu that is not as overwhelming as the restaurant's popularity. The price per item however, at around $4 and up, is at the boiling point when it comes to affordability."}
{"text":"First time to write a review here~ I visited this place two months ago, and I was brought to Rol San by my boyfriend who is a Guangdong resident. He recommended this restaurant highly as the best Guangdong food in Toronto. And it was no surprise that Rol San satisfied us so much!  Don't be worried about making a bad order because each dish here is amazing. Just think about what your stomach wants to have this time. But I would like to recommend desserts like egg tart and crispy cake since I'm a big fan of Guangdong style desserts. No matter oder them as appetizers or after meal desserts, you'll find them quite appropriate to match entrees and tea.  Little Tip: Ask the waiter to serve you their capsicol (??, an eatable spicy oil usually served as sources).Most of Guangdong dishes are light-taste so the capsicol can add a heavy taste if you're into it."}
{"text":"Hit or miss, Dim sum is fresh but sometime flavourless and just boring, other times not bad at all"}
{"text":"Ah the low rating is a bit harsh don't ya think? They do a wonderful job here, let's give them some credit, dim sum isn't easy to pull off and their restaurant isn't packed because they are bad at what they do.  Service was great, the place was packed and they did a great job from organizing the lines, flipping tables, taking orders, and bringing the food out. Great team here in my opinion.  The food was great, fresh, tasty, and all the dumplings we ordered were spot on. I was really happy at the end of my meal, dim sum takes a lot of team work and strong effort since this is a tougher service to pull off and they were doing a fine job.  I can't get this much in Iowa so this was a easy choice for me, but for the experienced pros this is a great option for you."}
{"text":"This place be lit. Open late means you can get that after exams or when you are wasted. The prices are cheap and the food is amazing. The beef buns are worth it on their own and everything else is pretty great. Would recommend out of 10"}
{"text":"This place is always busy, so when I saw that there was no line on Saturday afternoon (it was a crazy hot and humid day so probably a lot of people opted to stay home) we gave this place a try.   I'm giving it 2 stars b/c I really expected a lot more from this place.  The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't that great either. Don't get me wrong, it's decent dim sum but it's just not so good that would justify the crazy crowds it draws.   It also wasn't overly cheap either.  It's average price for average dim sum.   Note: this is a order-from-a-card place, not a push cart place."}
{"text":"Average some of the staff are rude.  Lots of better places in Markham.    Would be nicer with out the mainland shitty attitude"}
{"text":"Rol San is always my first choice for brunch, though I get up early usually. They serve dim sum all day and everything is very fresh.  Some may say service there is not good. Waitresses barely talk and are somewhat pushy. I wonder if it's because they are not native English speaker. So give them some patience and encouragement, maybe you'll feel better next time."}
{"text":"After a late night out and when the hunger pains hit this joint always saves the day!  Hot food fast...what's better than that at 1am?  If you are expecting something fancy...well...keep on expecting.  This is the place that had white plastic trash bag like tablecloths to help with customer turnover.  We ordered a bunch of dishes - chicken feet; har gow; fried rice; noodles, beef balls; beef short ribs and a few others which I'm sure I'm forgetting at the moment.   Everything was tasty - not exceptional but pretty good for soaking up the late night fueled alcohol evening :)  The service is quick and not overly friendly but wha cares at 1am.   Cheap and satisfying - what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Woohoo, finally found some good Dim Sum downtown!!! After my horrid experience at Bright Pearl across the street, I was pleased to see Rol San could actually make and serve proper dim sum with very reasonable prices.   So don't expect any carts here or anything like that, this is the mark down what you want type of place as they tried to cram the place with as many tables as they could. They have very reasonable prices ranging from $2 - 3.50-ish per item and all of the dishes we had today were all really tasty! We ended up spending $10 each (3 of us) and we were all pretty full by the end of it.  The place gets full pretty fast during lunch time so be prepared to wait a couple minutes. They serve pretty quickly though so the turnovers are pretty fast and they work very quickly at clearing tables and keeping the place clean."}
{"text":"Huge wait times on weekends but we knew that before heading there.  Food and service was good.  Prices are a little more expensive than usual but was still under 40 for the 2 of us.  They have those annoying plastic table covers that they take off after each diner.  Other than the wait times and table cover it was quite enjoyable."}
{"text":"WISH I COULD GIVE 0 STARS: DO NOT COME HERE! HORRIBLE PLACE   My boyfriend and I previously came to this dim sum place with a few family members one Sunday afternoon (it's really packed at this time) and had a quite pleasant experience. So much that we decided to come back just the two of us today for dinner.   The first time we came here, our relatives ordered for us since it was our first time so we didn't exactly know how to order when we came back. We ordered some siu mai, har how, shrimp rice rolls, and some deep fried shrimp dumplings. We had no complaints about the food (it was average) except for the fact that we were left with so much leftovers since the tiny order sheet doesn't specify how many pieces are given in each and the waitress was so quick to grab our order sheet that she couldn't even answer any questions we had. They move so fast for no reason and when they walk away it's hard to catch them again- I was trying to order drinks and she walked away from me. As if it was so busy and I was wasting her time, when really only a few tables were filled in the restaurant at the time.   The bill arrives at your table, and let me tell you: this bill does not specify what you ordered whatsoever which makes this place even shadier than it already is. SO SHADY. They just circle a bunch of random numbers and put some total beside, as if they're just expecting you to pay whatever they write. I didn't have a right feeling about it so I asked for a breakdown of the bill and it turns out they tried charging me for extra dishes than I had ordered and received. This changed the bill amount SIGNIFICANTLY when I pointed out this mistake!!! Wth really?! In their drink menu it also said $1.50 per iced tea can and when it came to the price breakdown it they charged me $2.50 per can. At least be consistent with your pricing, come on.  After this whole confusion, I was already about to leave with a negative feeling about this place thinking it couldn't get worse. The waitress passes me the machine to pay and puts it % tip automatically and hands it over. Of course I was going to tip her, but I looked over to my boyfriend and asked him how much % would be reasonable and she INTERRUPTS ME and tells me to put in 10% or 15%! Excuse me?! Last time I checked, the customer will decide how much they would like to tip you. I then asked her if she could wait as she was just standing right beside me watching what I input in the machine. Just cause she did that I tipped her 5% (I should've tipped her NOTHING) and when she saw she laughed and said \"really 5%?\", threw the receipt on the table, and walked away.   After this, we were so ready to leave but we waiting on our dessert and we couldn't cancel it cause we already paid for it. We waited for 20 minutes because the waitress wouldn't even walk our way (she would just stare at me from afar as I'm waving my hand in the air) and my boyfriend had to go up to one of the employees to demand we get it soon. After he did this, it came out a few minutes later-- turns out they didn't even process our dessert order in the kitchen but made us pay for it.   These people only care about their money and it's sad when they shame you on your way out because of how much you've tipped. They are all SCAMMERS!! You should not trust this place!!! The food is average anyways, definitely not worth coming back ever again. The customer service here will definitely make you have the worst possible dining experience ever. I have never been treated so horribly at a restaurant. I wish I read these terrifying past reviews before I decided to go here."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp for helping me find a good place for dim sum in the heart of downtown china town. I'm never sure what's good... especially when every restaurants seems to serve dim sum, and this one in particular has a giant sign, which leads me to believe that they need more business!!!!!  I walked in on a Friday to make reservations on Sunday - yes they do take reservations. I was thinking thank goodness because the restaurant seemed pretty small and not too many large tables. Walking promptly in at 11am, they didn't really care that i had a reservation but advised i go to the back to get a table... the back???  yes there is a back of the restaurant.. looked like a completely different atmosphere. much louder, more crowded, definitely a good crowd.  I scanned the entire dim sum sheet, noticing a lot of the usuals, but also some new items i've never tried..... we put in our order and the goodness begins to happen. food starts coming out within minutes, piping hot like it was made to order. I watch the waitors and waitresses on the pass - they are very careful with finishing each dish with the proper fixing, the proper sauce that I was pleasantly surprised at how committed they were. The service was attentive and people were speedy. Some straggling items look a little longer to arrive, but it gave my stomach a bit of a break. Everything got eaten and I really could not say which one was my favourite.   My standouts - the usual shrimp dumpling - clean and large, the sesame pastries - a little bit oily, but oh so tasty. the short ribs smelled so good and my brother and husband scarfed it down.  and the grand total for 7 people........... $50 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately Lee garden is closed so we tried next door Rol San.  After a long wait they took our order.  Our first mistake was we ordered soup and main dish, because they served both at the same time. We asked the waiter to keep warm the main dish in the kitchen, but we were told they have no room in the kitchen. So we had to decide which dish to eat warm and the other cold. But the most important mistake we made is to go to that place. The main dishes tasted bland and we left most on our plate.  We were puzzled how the restaurant going public is willing to accept such poor quality food.  But if you could not care much about the quality of food, you may find the quantity more than adequate."}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum, decent price, crappy ambiance (plastic sheets on the table) and the waiters aren't really attentive nor do they speak English very well but well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious! My favourite was the shrimp dumplings. Not the best looking restaurant and there usually is a bit of a wait. Their turn over is pretty quick since they just pick up one layer of the plastic table cloth and wrap all the dishes in it like most of the other Chinese restaurants in Chinatown. The service isn't that great but I haven't been to many dim sum places with outstanding service anyways."}
{"text":"Great dim sum place - I took all kinds of people here and everyone loved it. This place has a secondary large seating area in the back and gets packed during weekends so you need some patience and - get a number and wait in line. If you have a larger group come during off-peak times.  Must orders are shrimp dumplings, siu mai, calamari, fried noodles, and mango pudding. You can order these at night too, they do all-day dim sum.  The main attraction is the food at a reasonable price. This place isn't pretentious about putting truffle or gold on your dim sum, and is strictly street food style. I'd come here for the food, not for the refined dining experience or customer service. It's the typical Asian brusque style and you might get ignored a bit but they've never been rude. Also don't expect things to be super fresh or healthy at all, but it's pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Rol San = one word.  Barf.  I can not recommend this restaurant.  One look around and you see a sea of non-Asians seated at the tables and you should not walk, but RUN out of there.  I went tonight on a rainy Tuesday night with 2 girlfriends, and we ordered a feast of food (thinking there would be a 4th person to our trio).  From an overly doughy cripsy spring roll, to the dumplings in a broth that tasted suspect; General Chicken that had no heat and tasted oddly of fortune cookie batter, to the Cantonese noodles with bean curd and vegetables that was very \"meh\"; the overly garlicked green vegetable, the over usage of water chestnut as a decoy for actual scallops in a scallop dish, and the obligatory few dim sum choices like the shrimp and veggie dumplings that were very chewy and very un-al-dente.  And the sticky rice with pork that was bland.  Ugh.    This place was just awful...they use MSG in *EVERYTHING* and you will feel it during your meal and worse, afterwards.    If ever hunkering for Chinese food, I can positively vouch for any Asian Legend or Pearl Harbourfront.  Rol San is just garbage...I'm still reeling from how I will never see my $40 again..."}
{"text":"OVERCHARGING ON PURPOSE  I would normally give Rol San a 3.5 or 4 because I like their food and its consistent. But I will NO longer be going back because they are dishonest.  I had read the filtered reviews from Yelpers:  http://www.yelp.ca/filtered_reviews/O1TvPrgkK2bUo5O5aSZ7lw?fsid=zcwMI2fW3IOrep0y3L4KXg  that mentioned the bills at Rol San are always inflated i.e. if you ordered 4 dishes and they were supposed to be 25 including tax the bill said 30 or 35. The last time I went I asked to see my original order receipt during the meal (where you tick off what you want) and made a note of the dishes we ordered and received. And lo and behold when we GOT our bill, they had added an extra 15 dollars to the bill!  I told him about one dish we hadn't gotten and he took it off but it was still 10 dollars extra than what I had calculated including tax and drinks. Someone had mentioned in the filtered reviews that if you're students they add on tip and DON'T tell you. We tipped well on the bill in spite of the fact that it was more than it should've been and they said NOTHING.   They write the bill in such a way that you don't notice it, and normally as you're in bigger groups the extra 10 dollars may not be noticed. I've been here at least 10 times and only starting checking recently.  Honestly, as much as I love their taro balls and hagow I refuse to go here again because it's so disrespectful that they would do that to their customers and not even bat an eye."}
{"text":"I always love to eat at rol san. The dim sum really have a good taste. But every time i eat at rol san, i must queue at least 20 minutes before i got seat. But it was okay, since the dim sum taste really delicious."}
{"text":"Went here in the evening for dim sum, it was pricier and had lesser items on the menu than when you go earlier in the day. The Ha Gow was not as good, it didn't have the usual stickiness to it instead it was a bit hard.   Had mediocre service from a waitress who rushed us for the bill and tried to take it away while we were still counting. She counted the bill in front of our table and dared to ask us to add more tips as it was 'not enough' even though we had already added tip...  I would not recommend coming here in the evening. I've had better experience here during morning-lunch time."}
{"text":"Is there a way to give a restaurant ZERO stars? This place would get it. Food quality wise, it's a good place to eat. Most of their dishes are great (don't get the pork and shrimp dumplings). However, the service here SUCKS. The waiters/waitresses were unfriendly and extremely pushy, especially when it came to paying. My friends and I paid a total of $80 for everything we got and the lady rudely PUSHED us to give her an $8  tip. She would not allow us to leave without getting her tip, even though we had no intention in leaving one due to the crappy service.   I wouldn't advise anyone to come here, unless you're able to put with terrible service. That's just my two cents."}
{"text":"I'm not a dim sum expert but this seemed just average. The ha gow and siu mai were good but did not like the chicken wings or deep fried squid tentacles. We also got pork dumplings, egg plant, and curry cuttlefish and they were decent but I doubt I would order them here again. The service is not great but we knew that going in."}
{"text":"Rol San is a great bet for your dim sum fix...some personal faves include the BBQ steamed pork buns (a must!), minced chicken and chive soup dumplings, shrimp dumplings (har gow), crispy shrimp rolls, sticky rice in lotus leaf, and sesame balls.   No need to show up before 4pm....dim sum is served here at all hours (till 2:30am).  Dim sum? More like Dim YUM! (Sorry.)"}
{"text":"They say Toronto has some of the best dim sum in the country, so I was excited to start trying it out. And Rol San had reasonably priced & decent quality dim sum at 11:30 pm on a Saturday. What's not to like? Nothing fancy admittedly, but I wasn't looking to be pampered - just for some good eats to satisfy my craving.   We ordered three of the classics: har gao (shrimp dumplings), shu mai (pork dumplings) and fried radish cakes. For that and a pot of tea, it came out to ~13 CAD. The har ao and radish cakes were above par and the shu mai were pretty average. So overall I came away with a decent impression of the place, but nothing terribly mind-blowing. If you had to pick just one place in all of Toronto to eat dim sum, I'd probably go elsewhere, but given the timeframe, I'm pretty sure this is as good as it gets for late night cravings."}
{"text":"Big menu and everything is seasoned and cooked perfectly! They make the best dim sum I've had and at a great price!"}
{"text":"Rol San is a staple in our household on Sunday mornings. It's a no-frills experience, which I don't mind and actually sometimes prefer. Its main draws for me are the relatively cheap prices and quick service (make sure to arrive before 11AM!!). The food is also pretty decent -- nothing to write home about but still very satisfying."}
{"text":"Mediocre dim sum quality. But hey, how can you say no to all day dim sum? Their prices are fair and service is fast. Would definitely come back to satisfy my late night dim sum cravings."}
{"text":"Just going to give a quick run down of what I thought of each of the items I ordered. In general, though, the food here came out fresh and hot - albeit, one by one. IMO, it's better than the ones I've tried in NYC!   In order of what I liked most to least:  Beef Spare Ribs in Black Pepper Sauce - MUST ORDER. The beef is extremely tender and the sauce is very fragrant.   Siu Mai - Loved how they put roe on this. The siu mai is firm and springy, and the filling is very abundant yet not overwhelming. It's also not bland like manny other places.   Shrimp Rice Rolls - You can definitely tell that the rice rolls here are fresh, as the texture is very springy. Shrimp were plump, although wish there was maybe one more per rice roll.   Chicken Feet in Chef's Sauce - The chicken feet here was extremely tender and fell apart, so it was very easy to eat (didn't have to gnaw at the bones). However, wasn't too big a fan of the sauce, as it wasn't as flavorful and fragrant as the kind I'm used to having.   Deep Fried Squid Tentacle - While many Yelpers recommended this dish, I thought that the squid was very hard to chew. I didn't even end up finishing as a result. However, the outside is nicely battered and seasoned.   Pan-fried Turnip Cake - They did not provide any sauce with this. It also came a bit cold and was bland.   There was about a 20 minute wait 12PM on a Saturday, which was not bad."}
{"text":"Coming from San Antonio there really is a strong presence for a vast selection of Dim Sum so I was hella (trying to stay hip y'all) excited when I was visiting Toronto for the first time. Not only was it my first time (obvi) to Chinatown in Toronto but I knew I'd be in for a great Dim Sum spot.  Don't let the size of the restaurant deceive you, it's like Alice in Wonderland as they have a back dining room once you past the kitchen and bathrooms.  Don't expect some fancy schmancy dining experience, this is where you come to get your grub on and know that it's true dining.  The ordering process is fun as you select which items you want them to bring out (PLEASE NOTE IT IS NOT IN ANY PARTICULAR ORDER, JUST WHENEVER IT'S READY) and the quantity of each one.  My table ordered about 15 different variations including chicken feet, pork steam buns, soup dumplings (dumplings in soup), and so many more.  It was a great dining experience and just remember you must spend a minimum of $20CAD in order to use your credit card."}
{"text":"The reason I gave Rol San a 3/5 is mostly because of the cleanliness of the store itself. The bowls and plates are not washed as clean as it should be.(Maybe they re-use their dish water?) Anyway the foods good, certain dishes better than others. For instance the chicken feet in black bean sauce is to die for, though I could be a bit bias since I love chicken feet in general. If you're planning on giving Rol San a try I recommend the chicken feet, and fried tentacles."}
{"text":"I have very mixed feelings about this restaurant.  Some people swear by it, some people hate it...I'm somewhere in between.    The PLUSES: --Dim sum all day, everyday --Generally tasty food, not outstanding, but good --Late night hours --Moderate authenticity  The MINUSES: --Disgusting plastic tablecloths that look like garbage bags.  In fact there's like a stack of 25 on your table.  Big, big, big turn off. --Poor service, even for a Chinese restaurant --Dim sum is somewhat pricey for the quality --Difficulty communicating in both English and Cantonese...seems it's a Mandarin-only joint."}
{"text":"Anything wrong with eating dim sum at 10AM? Certainly not. I've eaten dim sum plenty of times in Chinatown but not here and I regret not eating here earlier on. This restaurant is very simplistic with the decor. The only con I have for this place is the tea pots...like really? Damn tea was going into your tea cup and onto your table...Frig, so annoying. Anyways...moving onto the menu. It's rather simple. The waiter gives this list of the dim sum items and in the box, you just write down how many orders you would like of each item and then you wait. It doesn't take that long for the food to come out. If you come really early before noon, the service is fast and you can actually take your time eating instead of being rushed out *cough* Sky Dragon *cough* The porportions are really huge. I really love how savoury, soft and big the har gow is, other places make them too small. The mango pudding was very delicious, not too sweet or creamy. Finally by the time, you're done, just go up to the cashier, pay, and leave :D I will definitely come back next time for more."}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum places I have been to.  The service is fast even during lunch/dinner rush, the waiters/waitresses are attentive and warns you if you are order quite a bit of food, since their portion size is pretty good compared to other dim sum places. Though they can be forgetful at times, so you have to make sure you know what you ordered.   The price is a little more expensive than other dim sum places, but that's understandable since they do not cheap out on their end product.  Definitely would go there again!  Food: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5"}
{"text":"always delicious. always packed and for a good reason, back of the restaurant is kind of ghetto but the food is delicious and high quality and that's what matters. no push cart here but that just means everything's made to order so hot and fresh. fave is the shrimp rice roll. i'm always in markham richmond hill for chinese food but rol san is the only place downtown i always trust for GREAT dimsum"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. All day dim sum, and they weren't out of anything we ordered which is a plus. The chicken feet are a must-try. The beef rice roll is amazing. Everything else was pretty standard but I would vote against the onion pancake unless you like yours very sweet. I guess I'm used to the Korean style pancake that's more savory. We ordered a ton of food for the five of us and the bill barely surpassed $10 a person."}
{"text":"DIMSUM (my sample of 30+ meals): 1) Avoid peak hours. Noon-1:30 on the weekend is an absolute must avoid. 2) Know what to order  Recommended: - Shrimp dumplings [ha gow] - Squid, non-curried version - Egg tarts - Sesame seed balls [jin doy] - Tofu fa (if available) - Steamed BBQ pork buns [Cha siu bao] - Stuffed eggplant - Chicken feet (acquired taste)  Good: - Turnip cakes [law bak go] - Stuffed green pepper - Taro dumplings [wu gock] - Shrimp cheung fun - Sticky rice in lotus leaf [nah mai gai]  Hit and miss: - pan fried beef ribs (when they're good, they're the best thing on the menu) - siu mai - beef tripe   DINNER  I think the dinner is only 3 stars. It's not my favourite, but it's passable. The quality of food is decent, especially compared to some of the other late night options  BONUS: You can see in to the kitchen. That makes a big difference in china town."}
{"text":"Expect to wait a loooong time if you are coming on a weekend dimsum. It gets packed quickly and there is very little standing room to wait inside. The place is divided into two sections, the front section is run by a man that remembers the sequence of people coming in. While the back section requires you to grab a number. If you have enough people in your group, I would recommend dividing and waiting in both lines for maximum efficiency.   Once past the frustration of being seated, check off what you want on paper (in both English and Chinese) and they will bring the dishes hot to your table. They didn't miss anything on our order and the food comes out fast. The quality of food is okay, I've had better and I've had worst so it's a solid choice if you are looking for dimsum downtown. Most dishes comes with 3 portions, so order accordingly for your party or be prepared to fight for a piece."}
{"text":"I think i can live of of dim sum so I'm quite fond of all day dim sum places. Came here with the family for a Sunday lunch and skate. From looking at other tables there were too many good looking items to try.  Had squid tentacles, siu mai, har gow, rice rolls, ribs, eggplant with shrimp, onion pancake, dumplings and tripe. I think I may have missed a couple but all tasted pretty darn good. Can't really say anything critical with any items. The place was also typical Chinese restaurant but a little more spacious. Service was OK. Some dishes were very slow and I didn't like the fact that they don't keep your order sheet on the table. It's hard to remember all orders with a big group. Other than that it was pretty good and definitely will come back."}
{"text":"The service is just REALLY terrible. When I try to ask about something, the servers either ignore me or when he does answer, he will just keep repeating the same thing for many time as if i don't understand. I WILL NEVER GO BACK!! I will tell my friend never go eat at that restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype about this place. So- it's a decent dim sum place with no pushy carts. It really does bug me when there are no carts. Sometimes, I don't know what I want until I see the cart and look at the quality.   We ordered: Haw Gaw (Shrimp Dumplings) Black Bean Pork Spare Ribs Pork/Shrimp Chive Dumplings Shrimp Rolls Something else that was not memorable?  All and all, the service is really poor and the prices are average/a little more than average. Even though we ordered everything at once, the dim sum came in 5 minute intervals each. I like my dim sum all at the same time.   I didn't have the best experience and I'm still on the hunt for some other dim sum places in Toronto."}
{"text":"All staff were mute and so rude. One of the worst service in Toronto. Won't go back again."}
{"text":"Its O.K.  While the dim sum was steaming hot, I missed having it served on carts where you can see your options.  If I ever need some shrimp dumplings, I will def come back!"}
{"text":"Thank you fellow Yelpers for leading me to this gem in Chinatown.  I don't usually give 5-stars to anything, but after one visit to this dim sum joint, I couldn't resist.  Don't pay attention to the fact that a) This restaurant is in Chinatown and most restaurants in any Chinatown (SF, LA, Vancouver, Seattle, etc.) suck!  b) Rol San has no direct Cantonese translation and c) There is a cheesy Dim Sum All Day sign up front.  This place is legit!  Like most yelpers commented, this place doesn't have carts.  For those of you stuck on carts, get over it!  Most of the best dim sum places I frequent use the dim sum menu card.  This system almost always guarantees fresh food over stuff in carts that may have been sitting for hours.  Highlights were piping HOT har gow, siu mai, deep fried shrimp dumplings with mayo sauce and a righteous Beef Chow Mein HK-style.  Mediocre items included ham sui gok (chinese footballs--OK), and beef cheung fun.    Couldn't stop eating the Beef Chow Mein as noodles were golden crispy with a gravy that wasn't over cornstarched and salty.  The beef and vegetables in the gravy were stir-fried just perfectly and went extremely well with the noodles.  If I wasn't watching the carbs, I would have finished that plate of noodles off myself!    Don't get me wrong, Rol San isn't the best dim sum I've experienced, but it was a pleasant surprise after being deprived of decent Asian food while hanging out in Belleville, ON for work.    Rol San is a great place to eat while checking out the Kensington Market area.  Highly recommend if you're in Toronto Chinatown and want a nice dim sum lunch.  BEWARE: They don't have wu gok (fried taro puffs) or daan tat (egg custard tarts) so if that makes/breaks your dim sum meal be prepared to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Initially I ended up here because the other two places we tried to go were full. Also, I was sad about there not being any waiters pushing carts around, but that didn't make the experience any less yummy.  They had seating enough for 9 of us at the last minute on a Saturday even though the rest of the place seemed busy too.   I really enjoyed all of the dishes that we tried, especially the pork buns and the potstickers.  I wasn't adventurous to eat the chicken feet, but the people who were thought they were good. It's nothing against this place. If I am offered the foot of any animal, in any circumstance, there is an extremely high probability that I will say \"No thank you. Please enjoy that all to yourself\"."}
{"text":"Really Rol San??? We show up early, the front room isn't even busy but it takes you 15 minutes to take our order and then you bring us lukewarm food. Pot of tea gets fully cold before our food arrived. Lots of staff around, not many customers, back room not even open yet..disappointing. Perhaps I'll have to shop around for a better dim sum restaurant who treats its customers well."}
{"text":"I'm not a torontian so I can't compare this place to other dim sum joints. We came just before midday on a week day. No gossipy ladies pushing carts: you fill in your order and hand it to the waiter.   The food is pretty damn good, we ordered shu Mai, zha liang, mushroom dumplings and Cha shao su. Of which I would at least recommend the first three.   Atmosphere and service goes as any other cheap Asian restaurant: not amazing."}
{"text":"This place used to be so awesome, now they sting on the portions. Had General two chicken and it was so thick with batter. I've been coming here for 10years. Their quality is slipping."}
{"text":"My first dim sum experience in TO!  Honestly there were alot of hits and misses it seemed. But i'll start off with the good stuff .. absolutely loved their sticky rice chicken wrapped in leaves (you know what it's called in cantonese). delicious! the starchy white rice rolls that wrap meat and is covered with soy sauce wasn't bad either. everybody else seemed to love and have this cuttlefish dish that we didn't opt for.   What to NOT go for: the \"cha siu so\". it's a pastry type baked good with bbq pork inside. awful! they used really cheap and/or fake shortening ... and so when you bite into the thing, it doesn't crumble properly and instead, sticks to the roof of your mouth. super weird. super FATTY! YUCK!  the cha siu was okay though.  so all in all .... very average. i would like to try out other TO dim sum joints to see if there's better. oh, and we ordered a plate of beans fried with beef ... it was ten bucks so the overall bill wasnt' cheap for sure!"}
{"text":"I like the food but don't like getting ripped off. We ordered 8 items ranging between $2.80 and $4.65. The bill came up to $42. I was surprised, paid it + 15% tip. I took a picture of the bill and did a count for myself and it came up to $37 with tax included. Rol San must think all of its customers are suckers and will pay anything they they tell them to. In my case I was a sucker since I paid it and added tip on top. I won't be coming back here cuz of the shady way they do business. If you do decide to go here don't bother with the tip, they've already snuck it in there. Adding more will make you a bigger sucker."}
{"text":"Late night Chinese food after clubbing. Can't go wrong with Rol San!! Food is reasonably price and great choices for the salty food cravers out there.  We got a variety of food including deep fried squid, beef and broccoli, chow mein, sweet and sour pork and beef fried rice. With the portion we received, we were able to feed 11 hungry people and a little leftover.  The place itself was pretty busy, they are well known around the neighborhoods. It is small but clean and very friendly and quick staff.  I will definitely give this place my blessings for people to go for quick eatery and satisfy the salty cravings."}
{"text":"Best all day dim sum in the GTA. Only because it's convenient, open late, and offers variety of dishes."}
{"text":"ALL DAY DIMSUM - literally! The best dimsum in Toronto. The place is ALWAYS packed. We were there this morning, walked in at 9:45 am and 30 minutes later there was a lineup! Took 10 minutes to get a menu and order, 20 minutes to get the food, and 15 minutes to stuff our face with dimsum goodness. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for dim sum, served piping hot and full of flavour. Tons of options to choose from. We've been going here for years and have tried other spots but we always come back to rol San... rice noodle rolls are amazing . Very busy spot, avoid peak times if possible ."}
{"text":"atmosphere: it's pretty average food: they actually have great food!  price: not bad! 45$ for four people  service: this is where it sunk- the employees were rather rude and they seemed bored, not pleasant to be around at all   first of all, they have nobody waiting at the front desk, they just wave fingers lazily as a question as to see how many people are eating   never came for refills, but they did come for bill  they almost never wore a smile   last but not least, they forgot like three dishes on our dim sum   rating: **/*****  if you're willing to eat nice food with bad service, then this place is perfect for you"}
{"text":"The dim sum here was excellent and very fresh.  So why am I only giving it two stars?  First, the dim sum menu could be a tad longer, but that is just minor. The main issue was the extremely rude service.  When  we asked for a soft drink the server did not bring one for quite a while, so when one of our party asked where it was, he mocked him by saying \"I will bring it NOW!\" with emphasis on the now.  When the check was presented, the plate it came on came with a small not about the payment methods they accept.  I did not have my reading glasses on and did not notice they only take Visa (not MasterCard for some reason, nor Iterac) and cash.  So I put a MasterCard down and the proprietor said no, the only credit card was Visa.  I then asked them if they take Iterac and instead of simply saying, \"I am sorry, we only take cash and Visa\" the hostess shoved the plate with the note in my face.  I paid with a Visa but we will not be back.  There is no excuse for that kind of rudeness, especially as our bill was quite large."}
{"text":"Great food.Great dim sum. Great for big groups. I like that the dim sum is made to order, but I miss the experience of having the carts!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this unassuming all day and all night dim sum in TO's Chinatown and we're coming back!  We eat dim sum almost every weekend and out of the 14 items we tried at Rol San we'd order each one again! The chicken feet were plump and nicely sauced, sticky rice was packed with flavour, I could've eaten the Pork Ribs in Pepper Sauce all day, soup dumplings a burst of goodness, and the hot oil was actually nice and spicy!  Rol San will be a dim sum mainstay for weekend brunch"}
{"text":"Yelp reviews were very accurate - rude waiters ( could put up with that) extraordinarily hot food, and two out of the three tables when I was there including mine were overcharged. You don't know the price of the beer even though I asked twice, and you have to recall what the price was of the dim sum. When I got home I figured I was overcharged four dollars on a $22 bill, however I also found  I mistakenly took their $.49 BIC pen. So there Rol San -  Karma!!!!"}
{"text":"Saw shark fin on the menu. Asked a server if it was for real, and was told yes. Walked right out without spending a single penny."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good although pretty pricey ($3/$4 for each dish) One thing though that urked me was their service.    The food took quite awhile to come and it was a bit of a wait with each dish. They forgot some of our orders and at the end ASKED for a tip. When asking they mumbled and just kept saying that we owe them a certain amount for tip.   I'd go to this place for a last resort. It's a bit sketchy and they have horrible service.  I do recommend their black bean ribs, shrimp roll, sesame ball, rice roll, and xiu mai(I think that's how its spelled)"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Quick attentive service and great food. Some favourite dishes of mine include the har gow, pork dumplings, shrimp and chive dumplings, pork buns and stir-fried veggies (from the dinner menu)."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday afternoon. It was busy but not much of a wait. The restaurant is basic, but it's still nice and comfortable. Service was friendly and the food was great! We ordered a lot of dishes and they all arrived quickly, the only dish that took long were the fried dumplings. For ten dishes the bill was $40. Not sure how that compares to other dim sum in the city but for that much food it seemed like a good value. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday afternoon and lucky for us, no line! Sweet. The restaurant is split into two parts and I was definitely not expecting the restaurant to be so big in the back. No carts when we were here so we ordered off the dim sum menu.  We had a couple of dishes which we shared: - Ha gow ($4) - Siu mai ($4) - Steamed bbq pork buns ($2.50) - I didn't get to try them but we brought them home as leftovers. - Steamed squid ($4) - delicious, tender squid goodness - Steamed chicken and mushroom on rice ($4) - Shrimp rice roll ($4) - Steamed pork meat and crab dumpling soup ($4) - this wasn't what I was expecting when I ordered it but it was very good. One massive dumpling and soup full of flavour.  Service was fast and typical dim sum style. You don't come here for the atmosphere so I don't know why people are complaining about that. Good tasty dim sum."}
{"text":"Best dim sum food and hot sauce that's made fresh! Highly recommended. Fave dishes to order are squid tentacles, Siu mai, sticky rice, shrimp rice rolls, and bean cured stuffed tofu."}
{"text":"We were in Chinatown during a weekday, and wanted to try some dim sum in Toronto. We had heard that this is one of the long standing dim sum places, so we decided to try it out. It was at the end of the lunch rush, and were seated right away. Overall, based on the standard dim sum dishes that we ordered (no carts), the taste was just average. Combined with the indifferent service, I would not return again."}
{"text":"Though they don't smile, nor check up on you, they get everything done efficiently. Not a long wait time for food; mind you that they're not the typical trolley dim sum, but via direct order. Their food is good and hot, at an affordable price. Their variety is also fair, and atmosphere is alright. Typical crowded Chinese restaurant design."}
{"text":"The food is not bad for the price but nothing great, you can definitely get a lot better in Toronto. The service is not great and really slow, it took over an hour for my friends and I to get our orders and it wasn't even a large order."}
{"text":"Funny my second restaurant in China town that have disappointed me.. Rol San use to be a popular downtown dim sum spot, like always when tourist starts popping up food Quality and service goes down. Dim sum came out cold food was over priced... wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"The service is borderline non-existent, but Rol San serves mighty fine dim sum in the middle of the afternoon.  I approve.  Get the BBQ Pork Buns.  The doughy bun and the filling were so good and sopped up some of the booze in my belly from earlier.  We also had the Pork Dumpling, which was good but not memorable.  The Beef Short Ribs in pepper sauce were very good.  Compared to the other dishes we ordered, the portion was quite large.  I don't remember what we spent, but for the amount of food we got, it was very inexpensive.  When it comes to traditional Chinese restaurants, aloof service seems to be the norm, so I accept it for what it is.  Just know and accept that you will have to ask to order, ask for your check, ask for water (and refills), and ask to pay for your check.  Considering how often you have to flag someone down, they sure like to avoid eye contact."}
{"text":"This is my GO-TO dim sum spot in Chinatown of Toronto. We normally park in the parking lot and walk over to grab dim sum. I was surprised that the second time I came here for dim sum was on a Saturday afternoon and I was expecting a long wait time but we ended up \"Daap toi\" (which means sharing table with strangers) without waiting.   So once you get seated you can start filling out on the paper what dim sum you want. LIke most dim sum places it is in English and Chinese. The dim sum here is not bad and the food comes out pretty quick. Also take note of when the order comes out and you are sharing table they might give it to the wrong side of the table or miss out on the order.  I think I would still come back here when I am back in Toronto since I have not found another dim sum place as of yet. The price is also very responsible too."}
{"text":"????? ?????????????? ????????????????? ????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??????"}
{"text":"Excellent dim sum in Chinatown- if you are in the area don't  miss this joint- low key - good price and tasty- I will come back many times - as many restaurants in the area cash only"}
{"text":"Good dim sum, not the best I've been to, but decent enough to get your fix."}
{"text":"I love all day dim sum. I thought the dim sum here was better than what we have access to in manhattan. The dumplings were fresh, the bbq roasted pork bun was fluffy and not overly sweet and the har gow were good too.  We ordered a side of chinese broccoli on the side (gotta get your veggies).  Actually we ordered a ton of food. And at the end of the meal we paid only $10 a piece. Pretty sweet!"}
{"text":"I went there last night around 9pm for a late dim sum dinner.  We started with the hot and sour soup, which was not hot and sour but actually sweet and sour and was magenta in color.    We then ordered an assortment of dim sum: Sticky rice-  DELICIOUS!  YOU MUST GET THIS Pork buns-  SOOOOO much bread, very little pork. Pan fried pork dumplings-  very good Spare ribs-  I didn't like them, but my friend did...perhaps I'm just not a spare rib type of gal. Garlic Filet-  Pretty good, nothing spectacular Har Gow-  Pretty good, nothing spectacular Shu mai-  Petty good, nothing spectuacular  So as you can see the food was hit or miss.  Aside from the soup we didn't get any non-dim sum items, which may be the way to go at the this place.    Service was only ok, but prices are good as we ate all of that plus two glasses of wine for $44."}
{"text":"Went to rol san tonight my girlfriend and i cuz every one on here say its really good so decided to try it out and cuz i dont no if we was young and black the savace was really poor the food was ok not what i expected they was very disrespectful to us so my girl told them we paying customers they can't speek to us soo they told us next time just dont come back to them stay home and eat and a next they over charge us $10 just never said nothing bout it cuz just wanted to live so i just pay its not all  that like what people talk bout the  place"}
{"text":"Honestly the dim sum was nothing special ... Was good but I don't know what all these people are raving about I've had way better dim sum in Toronto. As well the staff was rude, the over charged us 6$ I assumed it was a tip added to bill since the bill was in Chinese and scribbled. Turned out wasn't a tip was just over charged and they followed me and my sister out onto the street yelling about no tip. There extended menu is nasty and I wouldn't recommend anything but the dim sum. I honestly will never go back. PS WHO PUTS TOMATOES IN HOT AND SOUR SOUP?? What on earth gave them that idea I dono  THEY ALSO ADDED ON 10$ extra to my bill and charged me for tea... I don't even drink tea they just give it to you. I wish I read the reviews before going"}
{"text":"Points for having dim sum all day.  Minus those points for having a terrible system for waiting in line.  They don't have a list for who came first so it's all up to one guy to try to remember everyone's face which fails miserably.  People were cutting and there definitely seemed to be preferential treatment for certain ppl who knew the guy in charge.  But when it came down to the food, Rol San was good on most dishes - ham sui gok was one of the best I've had.  Everything else I ate was above average except for the soon juk goon which included large pieces of vegetables unlike usual."}
{"text":"Service is so bad. The old lady who served us has a shitty face all the time and acted like everyone owes her 50 bucks. I decide to leave a 1% tip just to show how I value her service. You know what? She chased us to the street demanding a 10% tip. She explains that the boss of the restaurant is not paying anything to the waitresses, all of their income comes from tips. IF THAT IS TRUE, PLZ NO ONE GOES TO THIS RESTAURANT BECAUSE IT'S A FREAKING SWEATSHOP!!"}
{"text":"Dim sum restaurant open late nights! Good food and good joint after a night of easy! ;)"}
{"text":"This Dim Sum place is awesome ! They opened early and we were able to beat the lunch rush . The  dim sum here is the best I've had ! The tapas were made fresh to order , so it did take some time for it to come out but so worth it !"}
{"text":"The best dim sum place downtown Toronto. Food is fresh and tasty, service is fast, and place is (relatively) clean. There are cheaper, cleaner, and better dim sum places, but they are all at least half an hour way uptown in Richmond Hill / Markham / Scarborough (current fave: Dragonboat Chinese Cuisine at Hwy 7 & East Beaver Creek).  My fave dim sum dishes: har gow and crispy fried taro dumplings (see description: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro_dumpling).  This place is also great late-night after clubbing, but be warned, they only have all day dim sum Sundays - Thursdays (so not available Fridays & Saturdays). We were a bit disappointed, but made do with congee, cantonese chow mein and salt & pepper pork chop instead. Still good!  ** A tip when going there for dim sum. It gets really busy on weekends and you always have to wait if you go after 12pm, so go early. If you can't make it out before then, and have to wait, be sure to try the back part as well as the front. There is a separate list for the section at the back, and I've found that it's often faster."}
{"text":"As an Asian American coming for the states, this food was great! Loved the sesame balls, lo bo gao, and shrimp rice noodle.   The only bad things were that the line was pretty long and there is no wait system. But overall well worth the wait. Noted 2013 best dim sum in Toronto!"}
{"text":"It's the weekend, you are hangover or just seek a great place to brunch for a friendly price in a buzzing atmosphere? Look no further, you must try Rol San.   First of all, avid bruncher, you better arrive early as the line up an get very long past 11am. They also give you the option to share a big table with strangers, and believe me it's a good occasion to make new friends.   Classical Dim Sum menu and all the dishes are well executed and delivered in a speedy fashion. I cannot have enough of their Siu Mai, squid tentacles and turnip cakes.   Service is always friendly even if they are busy."}
{"text":"This place is really good for dim sum, but I also love this place because it opens really late!  The food is always fresh and super super quick.  This place should get 6 stars for taste.  When we come late at night, we order off the non-dim sum menu too and that's great too.  Regardless of whether the place is super busy or empty at night, I just feel the servers sometimes ignore some of our requests for white rice or hot sauce.  This is a little irritating, but the food is so good and speedy that I don't care and I'd still rate this restaurant 5 stars!"}
{"text":"First:    Jules W., Rol San is not Taco Bell, you are supposed to tip, and the amount you left is pretty unacceptable.  I completely side with the restaurant on that one.  You gave them $0.50, Canadian standard tip is 15%, so that means you should have given them at least around $3.50.  $0.50.  Wow.     Now on to the restaurant review:  I usually prefer Forest View for dim sum, but since it was closed for renovations, and my friends and I were starving, we decided to give Yelp recommendations a try and went to Rol San.  The total bill was around $70 for 4 people, so we definitely tried many different things.  Why I will never go back:  - no carts.  gotta have the carts (but this is a personal preference thing).    - the dumplings all tasted the same.  The shrimp, the pork, everything was pretty indistinct.  - the tofu skin with shrimp paste was FOUL.  Weird texture, sort of like that of a plastic wrapper that had been accidentally steamed onto what we were eating.  Nearly impossible to bite through.    - I can't read kanji, so when I saw the name \"soup dumplings\", I thought \"Yes!!! They have xiao long baos!!\"  Nope, it was literally soup WITH dumplings.  huge frown, but that was also my fault for not clarifying.  still, felt a bit salty.     - egg custards had  zero flavor.    - The staff is definitely not the most pleasant and friendly bunch of people.  We felt like we were inconveniencing them when we wanted to order beverages or were ready for our bill.    So, all in all, not terrible, but definitely not worth going back for."}
{"text":"Dim Sum and service are soso. No picture menu so this is not for amateur. Try the boychoy and the pork steamed buns. I hope this is not the standard dumpling in TO. Next to try is Crown Princess."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I'm downtown and craving for some late night dim sum. My most recent trip here was after a Raptors game - rather than spending $10 on 2 chicken fingers at the ACC, my friends and I came here right after the game and ordered the standard ha gow, beef tripe, curry squid, congee, etc. The quality of the food is decent - definitely not as good as the nicer places uptown or Markham, but good enough to leave you satisfied. The service here is very efficient and the food comes out fast."}
{"text":"As far as the Dim Sum experience Rol San is pretty famous in Toronto. Very popular. With that said the dim sum is just fine. Reasonable selection that you order off a sheet. No carts. Fine with that. What I'm totally NOT fine with is a place in a major world city that does not accept Mastercard. Seriously?!? My wife and I ate quite a bit and when we settled they dropped that bomb on us. I am traveling so I go light - one credit card and just enough cash to get a coffee. So, I was told to go to an ATM...I did not bring my card. This was a terribly inconvenient way to end an ok dinner. I should also add that they accepted my Mastercard last year so I'm not sure what happened. With as much business as they do they should eat any small fee to make it convenient for those of us visiting."}
{"text":"i would say best dim sum in TO. Not the cheapest but worth every penny.  Worth the line up, their service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. On my first visit, my BBQ steam pork buns never came out. We also had to wait 15 minutes between each dish to come out. While on my second visit, it was almost a 45 min wait! I was so mad when he sat another couple that came 20 minutes after me before me! Eat with Chinese people, they seem to get seated first.  The waitresses are amazing. I probably would have lost my mind working here. Also, the dim sum dishes here are delicious! I have had the shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, BBQ steamed buns, calamari, chicken feet, fried shrimp rolls, beef short rib, and pork short ribs.   The portion for the calamari is good but the calamari itself was a disappointment. I would give the food at 3.5, but due to service they get a 3."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. A smorgasbord of quality dumplings and other dim sum treasures (and decent looking entrees, though I've not tried any yet) as well as soups can be found here. The place is authentic, friendly, and delicious. My friend and I ordered a few dishes and it turned out to be an absolute feast. We both left the place sated and warmed."}
{"text":"Rol San is amazing for dim sum at any time of the day (all-day dim sum rocks)! The pricing is fair, and dishes are always proportionate and tasty!  I frequent this place pretty often since I live close by. It looks like a dingy little place, I won't lie... I discovered this place when my friend and I were desperate for some dim sum late in the day and we just randomly chose Rol San because of the giant all-day dim sum sign. But I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, despite the exterior of this place. If you're looking for good, cheap dim sum, this is the place for you!  I haven't tried any of the dishes here other than the dim sum so I can't really comment much on other dishes that they have.  My favs: Har Gow Sui Mai Deep Fried Taro with Pork and Crab Chicken Feet Short ribs"}
{"text":"I would come back here again even though I had to wait around 30 minutes to get a table. That's saying a lot for me. I've been known to walk out of Shoppers Drug Mart when I stand in line for more than 3 minutes, and if you know how much I love SDM...well, enough said.  Once you get a seat the service is fast and the Dim Sum rocks. Bonus points if you bring two or more friends - more people to share with :)"}
{"text":"After craving dim sum for quite some time now, we finally made our way over to Rol San. I could not remember (based on the name) whether or not I had dined here before. I knew there were all kinds of all-day dim sum restaurants on Spadina, but was not recalling the names of all the ones I had frequented. I did, however, recall enjoying one place in particular and my husband was insistent that it was Rol San. He was right!  We came here for dinner, so we managed to avoid the crazy lineups I've read so much about. It was after 8:00, and the dining room was emptying out, but there were still a few groups of people there, many families, and some with kids running around. I've come to expect this kind of behaviour when dining at establishments that welcome families and children and I have just decided to not let it bother me.   While arriving a bit later did get us seated right away, it did also mean that some of my favourite menu items were no longer available including the rice noodle rolls. That being said I really did enjoy all the other favourites that we ordered. We maybe went a bit overboard, and had to take some food home with us, but I have no regrets.   The food came out quickly, it was all really hot, almost too hot to eat at first. My favourite dish of the night was the grilled eggplant.   My only complaint if I had one...and I know this is something very common in many Toronto restaurants (particularly in Chinatown)...they don't take Mastercard, or Debit. Only cash or VISA.   I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Looking for somewhere late night for a bite in Chinatown, this place is open until 2. The dim sum menu is extensive and has something for anyone and everyone, some traditional offerings and some less so. I didn't bother looking at the other menu. The food isn't great, although the seaweed rolls were very tasty, if chewy. Har gau were small and not particularly tasty. The place is dirty and the characters hanging around late evening aren't overly friendly. That the staff was talking about the customers in Cantonese in clear site was also unpleasant. Walking by the kitchen to the graffiti-laden and filthy washroom yielded scents of desserts baking- making no sense in a dim sum restaurant. Staff was functional only, a gent who appeared to be the boss stood around the dining room while ordering far busier staff to take orders and bus tables left for quite a while despite the easy cleanup afforded by plastic tablecloths. I won't be returning with the number of other options available."}
{"text":"Was here on Christmas Day for some delicious dim sum as as expected other than Chinatown most of the shops and restaurants were closed. Arriving at just before noon and the place was already packed. Apparently there is a separate dining area for smaller parties in the back that we didn't know until after the host informed us. Fortunately we didn't have a long wait only about 5-10 minutes after getting the seating number.  They definitely stress on turnaround efficiency due to the volume, the tables are already laid with layers of plastic covers for easy clean up and I saw on the menu that they have an hour dining limit. Not sure if they really enforce it but I can see why that's needed when we left the place there are about at least dozen+ people waiting for their seats. Service is what you can expect at a crowded dim sum place, pretty much have to flag down the staff in order to get what you want. Plus they use a write in menu making it harder to get more later on. Despite the crowd the food is definitely worth a visit if you're a fan of dim sums  Actually tried out a few new items and had a very pleasant experience. The fried squid is definitely a must as they're very chewy and don't really need any sauce on top. I also really enjoyed the crab and pork dumpling soup, at first I thought we were getting soup dumplings but it turns out to be one giant dumpling in soup. Quite flavorful and definitely a bit trickier to share.  Mango pudding was another must try, although we had to remind the staff we had order it for them to bring it out but definitely worth the wait. The price was quite reasonable too although its my first time in Toronto so I couldn't compare to other dim sum establishments in the area."}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure place for Dim Sum.  I love Dim Sum and this place is great! It is very Chaotic in the morning. It is a mad rush, with people going in and out. A server is directing people in and out. I just do not know how he does it, the tables are turned over at a fast rate. The wait is not that bad on a Saturday at lunch time!   All the classic dishes are there. I find that Ha Gao (Steamed Shrimp Dumplings) and Siu Mei (Steamed Pork Dumplings) a bit pricey ($4.95) but its worth it!  I go here all the time for Dim Sum and it fails to disappoint! You would probably see me here on Saturdays eating Curry Cuttlefish and Fried Squid in complete bliss. Chinese food just does that to you!"}
{"text":"Yowsa!  Fantastic dim sum at a great price.  From outside, you might think it looks like a bit of a dive, but inside is clean, spacious, and well looked after.  I love how, after patrons leave, the waiters just grab the plastic table-cloth and scoop up all the dishes in one big bundle.  There's no cart service, but if you find cart delivery to be intimidating, that's a bonus.    The har gau and siu mai are as good as it gets.  Try also the rice steamed in a lotus leaf, and the dumplings with shrimp and bamboo fungus (sounds awful, tastes divine).  Let's face it.  Dim sum is addictive.  Rol San is a fantastic place to get your fix."}
{"text":"With service this bad, the quality of the food is irrelevant. Slow, unhelpful, hostile. Staff ignored being called. Didn't bring water when asked multiple times. Berated and accosted when got a low tip.  Stay away.  PS. If you're still interested in the quality of the food, it was rancid. Marginally edible."}
{"text":"A Chinese restaurant where applies racism to Chinese people lmao. Never go to this restaurant again. I've posted their racist actions on social media. We will see."}
{"text":"I chose siu mai, shrimp and chive cake, and fried dry shrimp and minced pork dumpling. What was advertised as fried dry shrimp and minced pork dumpling ended up being only minced pork dumpling! Upon inquiring about the discrepancy, the short waiter indifferently said the menu is old! What an epic screw up! Later I presented my visa as payment and they flatly said I could not use my visa! Their banners inside the restaurant clearly stated \"Visa or Cash only\" so why is it that you refuse Visa?!  They then said I need to spend a minimum of $20 to use Visa! My total was $16 and the waiter offered to change the price to $20 without allowing me to order an additional item! Wtf? I ordered a single pop to add to the total and paid $20 on my Visa!  I will never return to this shithole and service-deprived cesspool! They are a blatantly dishonest business."}
{"text":"Estimate wait time is usually a lot shorter than the actual amount of time you wait for a table to open up.   People working here are surprising nice for a Chinese restaurant in Kensington Market. Went for their Dim Sum menu during noon and a week day and we waited for about 20 minutes. The selection of Dim Sum is tiny compared to any place in Markham!! Food was below average.."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time and at a right time I must say because I was desperately craving for dumplings, must say that I loved their dumplings both fried and steamed their fried shrimp dumplings are a must try!!"}
{"text":"* take out only and food review   Was in town for a weekend and had a lot of places to get to so got the food to go at 9am. Friend went in and ordered so i never got to see decor or experience the service.   but the food was really delicious. We got har gao (2 orders), shu mai (love), some kind of pork steamed dumpling, har chong, chicken buns, fried salty sticky ball (with ground pork inside), radish cakes. This was enough for 2 Asian girls for both breakfast + lunch and a total of $35CAD.    Even when we had the semi-cold food at lunch time, the fried salty sticky balls was crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. radish cake was outstanding with the right firmness of texture and lots of radishes and meat bits that you can actually discern.    Would definitely go back when I go back to Toronto next time. Friend mentioned that a lot of regulars were there when it opened at 9am on Sunday."}
{"text":"Most things that need to be said about this place have been. But my idiosyncratic 2 cents:  - crispy beef is the reason to go here! because it's fantastic, though not 100 percent consistent. (sometimes more 'battered' than others, but stil great.)  - when they have all day dim sum (sun-thurs) you can get a plate of crispy beef, two steamed sticky rice packets, and some bbq pork buns (or insert your preferred dim sum items) for under 20 bucks. then you and a couple other people can be pretty full.  - the thing that keeps this from being 5 stars in my books is that they don't have the lotus paste sesame balls, and they DON'T DEVEIN THEIR SHRIMP! if this grosses you out a lot then definitely avoid things with shrimp in them. myself i just eat my har gow in one bite and think about something else."}
{"text":"I don't have to drive to Markham for good dim sum anymore!  First impression: the biggest jar of savory pepper oil was on our table. I was overjoyed because fancy dim sum places give you only a dab to last throughout the meal. Needless to say, I lavished each dumpling in red pepper oil!  Fave dim sum baskets:  -The plain chang fun (I think they called it a rice roll) was gooey-chewy goodness on its own, and had a hint of jasmine tea infusion, seemingly. The sprinkle of sesame seeds on top plus the peanut dipping sauce added just enough incremental flavor.  -The tapioca custards (maybe called \"pellets\" on the menu) were gelatinous and had the consistency of tiny clear pearls like from a boba drink! Delish hot and sweet, but also good cold!  Minus one star because the shrimp weren't de-veined =( That's an absolute essential with me. And I went waaay overboard eating my last sesame ball. Yes, it was so good I totally stuffed myself!  Convenient. Fast service (at 1PM on a Saturday). Lotsa tables. Inexpensive. Easy to read menu that still allows for some \"surprises\"!"}
{"text":"Pretty expensive for the quality, and is always packed for dim sum lunch. i've only ever come here for dim sum so I can't speak for anything else. The dim sum menu has all the classic dishes but nothing more."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC dim sum at a great price!! Such an unexpected surprise. We asked our taxi driver to recommend a great dim sum restaurant and he drops us off at Rol San. It has a small and unassuming storefront and we were shocked to discover a very packed back room filled with happy customers.   To feed the four of us, we ordered:   Bokchoy, chicken feet, shrimp dumplings, shrimp wrapped in rice, shrimp and pork dumb kings, barbecued pork buns, turnip, squid, and beef tripe.   Everything was full of flavor and at a great price, totaling $52!   The restaurant asks customers to stay for just an hour as they're packed all day! Fast service and hot and high quality food. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I was so ready for some cheap and delicious dim sum last weekend. At least I got one of the two.   My friend and I got here around 10:00 am on a Monday and were seated promptly. The restaurant was probably 80% full. We ordered a moderate amount of food and finished a good percentage of it. Don't let the tiny plates fool you, we were absolutely stuffed off what appeared to be tiny portions of food.   The deep fried squid tentacles and curry cuttlefish were great, as were the shrimp dumplings. The shiu mai were okay and I've definitely had better elsewhere. We ordered some desserts (coconut red bean pudding, mango pudding and deep fried pumpkin balls) to finish off our meal and were not disappointed. Everything came out hot and was satisfactory. They could stand to use less salt and MSG but as long as you're not eating here everyday, it's not something to lose sleep over.   The prices are what turned this would-be 4-star review to a 3-star review. Like I mentioned before, we ordered a moderate amount of food. The amount we paid per person was $20. I've never paid that much for Chinatown dim sum in my life. I'm not confident it was an overcharge as I've done the math and everything almost adds up. Maybe we should have been more conscious about what we were ordering (prices were mostly $4.88 and below) but seriously, for $20 and some change, I could have had a really good dinner at a different establishment.   Not return-trip worthy. I'll take my $20 and seek out a dim sum place with real tablecloths rather than a stack of plastic ones!"}
{"text":"Best Dim Sum I've had.  Use to always go to the one in the sky, but never again.  You won't be dissapointed.  Had the Sizzling Duck, which came out HOT and was delicious.   Safe bets are the chicken wings and rib tips.  Good portions and delicious.  If you are adventurous try the feet or calamari.   You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Generally good(except the chicken feet looks and tastes weird)and all-day dim sum. Great Cantonese food! You have to be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Not bad.  I love the fact that they serve all day dim sum, the shrimp dumplings are awesome. The prices are slightly higher than other places but the portion sizes are good."}
{"text":"Living in Toronto for the first time, I felt that it was essential that I find myself a good Dim Sum place. Why? I'm an addict.  So far, this place is the best I've found. Always packed to the brim on the weekends though, so if you're going then, go really early or go really late.   The only criticism I could make is that they have chili oil instead of proper hot sauce - my addiction extends to hot sauce too.  I recommend: Shu Mai (pork and shrimp dumplings) Sticky rice in lotus leaf"}
{"text":"Bad experience! Plates and bowls were not clean beforeI used them. The deep-fried eggplant tasted like leftover. And don't recommend the vegetables dumplings!"}
{"text":"Pretty good dim sum spot! I'd definitely come again. They have a great selection and each dimsum is different in texture and flavour, really good prices too.   Came here on a Sunday with some friends at around 3:15 pm, there was a 10 min wait and we were seated. Granted the service here isn't top notch, but it's a dimsum place, if you can serve my food in a.timely manner and refill my water/tea when I need it, then I'm pretty happy.  Loved the shrimp dumplings, the sticky jasmine rice, the shrimp stuffed eggplant, and tons of other memorables that my gf ordered. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed long waiting time, the  manager has a shitty attitude and left a whole table for ten empty and let us waiting for more than 40 minutes, shitty attitude with no respect for customers at all, one star for sure - will never go here again."}
{"text":"There's  a complete other world out there and i had no idea Rol San had dim sum.  What is rol san to me? It's my drunkard chant after a good night of drinking. Rol San is open ao late that it becomes the place we go to after the bar. and literally, you end up bumping into a lot of friends who've chosen to party and eat after.  what's special about rol san? it's good, cheap and where else can you order lobster at 3am if you really wanted it?   now i must go there for dim sum....and break all my cardinal rules and go there in day light. i feel dirty."}
{"text":"I must have come on a \"off day\" because the dim-sum was mediocre and the service was exceptionally bad at Rol San. We waited to be seated for 30 minutes, even though there was no line when we arrived. The attendant ignored us in favour of waving in Chinese speakers which was especially frustrating. The food itself was greasy and sub-par compared to my previous dim-sum experiences. We ordered deep-fried squid tentacles which were dripping in oil, and chewy, indicating they were probably frozen. The traditional dumplings (har gow, etc.) were decent, but wrapped in a very thick dumpling wrapper that was less palatable than the wrapper at comparable restaurants. Considering the prices, it wasn't awful, but it was certainly greasy, unsophisticated and mediocre."}
{"text":"Decent all-day dim sum food with each dish averaging around $3. You can't beat the price but all the foods are a little overly flavoured.   Go for: freshly made dim sum food with a price you can't beat  Don't go for: the best the city has to offer"}
{"text":"I stand corrected.  We went back for dinner last night.  Note: do not get the shark fin soup.  We tried to return it because first it was too salty and then it was too bland; they said they'd take it back but still charge us for it....! (I know, I know,this isn't the kind of place to order shark fin soup)  It wasn't the soup that turned us away, it was the response of the waiter and the subsequent poor service.  As soon as my husband paid and signed the receipt, the waiter rushed over and noted \"oh you didn't leave a tip, are you sure?\"  That put me off...  The traditional dim sum options are still good and fairly priced... Pay for the food not the service type place."}
{"text":"This was ok not great not good lo mein was watered down but general to's was really good. As i sit here the chinese beer was prety good. I wouldnt run here and considering all the other places in the area i would have chosen another place.. This was recommended but the hotel desk clerk (ugh)!"}
{"text":"We have an office in the hood and this is among the best (top three) we've found so far for lunch time dim sum as a group.  Five can eat until 110% full for less than $50.  Great dumplings!"}
{"text":"Decent dim sum - the service is very efficient and fast. Don't get fooled by their front seating size as they have a massive seating area in the back.  I usually have shrimp dim sum and fried pork dumplings. They also seem to have special dishes but many special menus are only in Chinese so I can't read them (I wish their menus are bit more english friendly).  They open 24/7 and this is THE go to place for dim sum especially you have a large group!"}
{"text":"Although the food is good, be very careful, THEY WILL OVERCHARGE YOU. rude service too, will comment on your tip."}
{"text":"My favorite dim sum place in Toronto. Their service is pretty okay too, the servers were attentive and we got our food in about 15 mins. Their hargao/fried squid tentacles/curried squid/tripe are all very delicious. I made the mistake of ordering the crab soup dumpling. I expected 4 small succulent soup dumplings and instead I got 1 big mediocre dumpling sitting in soup and lard..."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a while , food is very good , staff do not take order properly and you get really really disappointed. In short service sucks."}
{"text":"This was recommended by my buddy, we had a group of 6 persons.  There is no reservation.  So we turned up at 10:30 am on a Saturday morning.  It is right in the heart of China town.  The dim sum is good but not exceptionally good.  There are a lots of choices though.  My favorite is the most common item i.e. Pork Siu Mei (Steamed Pork Dumpling) and the Baked Taro Pufff.  Everything is good but not exceptionally good.  I had better dim sum in London, England or of course in Asia.  However, the atmosphere is very lively, close to what one has in Hong Kong.  Plenty of chatting and lively conversation and non stop eating. Don't expect to stay and chat on a busy weekend.  Once you finish your food, the bill will be presented to you without asking!! All in all, it is a kind of eat and out place.  Was this review ??"}
{"text":"Spadina, Chinese food -- is there really anything you can complain about? Its not like you don't know when you're already going into it. \"All Day Dim Sum\" --- UHHH YEAH?! The best.   It was a busy Monday lunch and there was a small wait ahead of us. They definitely accommodated. Big tables was asked to be shared with groups of two. The table turnover was quick, however they most definitely did not rush anyone. The food came out in a timely manner and tasted absolutely delicious. Honestly other than the back room being closed for renovations there is not alot that you can really complain about.   Definitely hit the spot. har gow, siu mei, deep fried shrimp dumplings, shrimp rolls, squid tentacles, steam rice. DELICIOUS!  Great for Brunch -- and for those super late nights ;)"}
{"text":"The yin yang fried rice is good and so is the Shanghai fried noodles.  The dim sum dessert in the shape of a little pumpkin topped with a cashew nut and filled with runny custard is just amazing, and I have enjoyed those lil' pumpkins so much!  Food service is prompt and the servers are friendly.  Open til 2am on weekdays and til 4am on weekends, voila!"}
{"text":"Super busy on a Saturday at noon, but they had us seated within 10 minutes.  Food came quickly and was pretty decent dim sum, though definitely not the best I've had. Would go back again."}
{"text":"2 dim stars for this one.  Walking into Rol San, I was greeted by a smell that reminded me of the garbage strike in 2009. Roll San, you've got to febreeze it up or wash them dishes. The plastic sheets on the table tops reinforce the garbage motif. Not good.  The dim sum was dimly flavorful. The duck tasted pretty miserable. Lots of assorted aka mystery meat in the rice. No party in my mouth."}
{"text":"This was fun! My boyfriend took me here after he had gone for lunch with a colleague a couple days before. I was skeptical as I would much prefer Vietnamese food over Chinese. I'm usually not into gluey.. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised. When we walked inside the place was huge! There's a front dining room, a middle dining room, and a large back dining room.  Each table had a stack of white plastic sheets on it. When people were done eating the waiters would come around and just take the 4 corner from the sheet and remove all the plates everything at once! Quick turnover. Never saw that before.  At the table there's a sheet of paper where you make your selection of how many of each thing you'd like. They start you with tea for $0.60 per person if you wish - it was delicious. We ordered 5 or 6 things. I remember the pork buns - yum! Also the pork dumplings were very good. I didn't like the short ribs - those were a little gluey, but had a good flavor. We got these rice ball things covered in seeds for desert - those were filled with black bean, absolutely delicious! Fun atmosphere, everyone is eating and having a great time. Check it out. My first \"All Day Dim Sum\" experience."}
{"text":"BEST DIMSUM RESTO IMO  Yeah ive been to quite a few high ends ones too but i just love rol san  Its open till really late and they have the friendliest servers (maybe it only applies if you speak canto) they are so considerate though!! Like when you went out of tea you dont even have to ask they just come very promptly to refill  Their pumpkin dimsum is bomb must have!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Dim Sum; rock solid in just about every area for quality and taste.  Especially fantastic was the Snow Pea Pod leaves with Garlic Sauce, the Pork Dumplings (both Fried and Steamed), and the Fried Squid.  BEWARE though...lines on the weekends between 11-2 can be insanely crazy!  Toronto remains one of my most favorite places for great food...jealous we don't have Dim Sum of this quality in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.  I came here on a Monday morning with my partner. We were able to find nearby street parking and were seated immediately. Easy breezy!  We had...  Shu Mai Ha Gow - Steamed Shrimp Dumpling Steamed Mushroom & Bamboo Dumpling Deep Fried Shrimp & Chive Dumpling Chicken Feet & Black Bean Sauce Tripe with Ginger & Scallion Steamed Minced Beef Ball Deep Fried Squid Tentacles   I thought the dumpling skins were a little too thick but overall good. I liked everything except for the tripe. The tripe didn't taste clean to me. It needed to be washed a little more. I couldn't continue eating that but everything else was tasty enough. The squid tentacles were delicious! I loved that it was all tentacles (my favorite). If I had more room in my stomach I would have easily ordered more things. They had a pretty good selection especially for not being carts and just menu options.  The restaurant wasn't very clean. We had to wipe down our dishes and rinse our silverware but come on... don't act surprised when going to these kind of places. Just make do with what you got or don't go to Chinatown!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch on a Wednesday and had a great experience. The restaurant wasn't that busy since it was a weekday, so we didn't have trouble getting a seat, nor did we ever feel rushed - though this might not be the case if you come on the weekend. The restaurant ambiance and decor aren't that fancy, but it's charming in a home-y kind of way.  The food was very good - better than most dim sum I've had before. They don't have the traditional carts, which is a bit of a bummer - I enjoy seeing the food wheel by and picking what I want. But the upside is this means the food is all made fresh to order - no worrying about food sitting out for too long. Just make sure you have some dim sum experience and know what to order, though, since you won't be able to see the food and just pick what looks good. Dumplings are always a safe choice (except the soup dumpling - that was strange). For the adventurous, they have good squid, cuttlefish, and chicken feet. They have a special hot sauce that you can get if you ask - I didn't particularly like it, but you're welcome to give it a try.  Overall this was a really good restaurant. I haven't been to other dim sum restaurants in Toronto, so I'm not sure how this one stacks up. But if you're looking for good eats, you've found a great place."}
{"text":"A long established dim sum restaurant in the heart of Chinatown Toronto. I can get quite busy and packed if you go on a weekend, but you can easily secure a table if you show up early, like 10:30-11am.  Unfortunately for Rol San, the dim sum scene in Toronto has changed considerably in the past 10 years, and the plastic sheet covered tables, the out-dated decor and the fairly standard and \"safe\" selection of dim sum means that they will have to do better. The prices are average, but I think it needs to be even cheaper for them to stay competitive.  Personally, I am open to coming back here if friends wants to eat here, but given a choice, Rol San would not be a place I'd choose."}
{"text":"Meh, I guess I'm too cheap, the dim sum are categorized by price ranged, the smalls are 2.88, har gow and siu mai are 4.88. The siu mai had shrimp in it, its good, but too pricey.  Don't get me wrong, its fresh and way better than the T&T dim sum for 2.50.  But when you go eat dim sum, you always order har gow and siu mai, and for 4.88 each, its pricey.    When I went in, it was busy but not too busy, so we got a seat pretty quickly.  Siu mai came right away, and the rest of my order almost came in all at once.  Service was good, waitress seemed a little shy but I got my food which was what mattered.    Really nothing I can say bad, but the price.  What's the point in paying over double when you can go to Markham and get it for half price, plus i don't have to pay for parking.  I completely understand why people go north for food now.  btw, the prices that are in the images, are not up to date, not sure if i missed morning or it was a sunday, but the images of the prices on the menu, add 1 dollar to each items."}
{"text":"Dim sum was mediocre and a little expensive especially given the quality. Have had much better in Chicago, SoCal, NYC, and DC. Was visiting Toronto during a long weekend. Service was not an issue. The fried squid had a sweet out of place tasting batter, similar to that used on corn dogs. Agree with other yelpers that the all-day dim sum is a positive. Would probably not go back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: The restaurant is spacious. It is decorated well with some of the specialities written and used as a wall decoration. The tables consists of a white plastic table cover  which (after the meal and they've taken the plates) they remove. Aesthetically it may not look great but it does save time rather than cleaning/scrubbing an actual table cover. This is an establishment that is also very clean!  Food: I've mainly gone here for dimsum. From har gow to friend tentacles and delicious chicken feet. I really do enjoy eating dim sum here. Rather than them moving from table to table with a cart of dim sum, you are given a paper menu listing what they have and you order from there. The food arrives hot and delicious!  Price: Rol San is on the pricier side. I think I'v spent more money there compared to other dim sum places but then again as I stated above, thee food is delicious and the place is clean!  Service: Depending when you go, service can be really slow. Sundays around noon time you'll be waiting in a line for around 30-45 minutes. Once seated, the servers attend to your needs asap."}
{"text":"My first DimSum restaurant in Toronto, and I was definitely not disappointed. I loved their shrimp dumplings, snow pea leaves, rice roll with crispy donut, their green beans with pork and chicken & mushroom steamed buns the most. We ordered a lot of other dishes that were delicious as well. For a large group, on a Sunday, the wait was less than 20 minutes despite being incredibly busy.  Service was prompt and pleasant. Price was extremely reasonable. All in all, a winner!"}
{"text":"This is the best Dim Sum in Toronto. They have the best har gow I've ever had, and I've had Dim Sum at great places in Hong Kong. It's order off a sheet, not carts, which I prefer. They do a great snow pea leaves with garlic sauce, which makes a great veggie accompaniment to the Dim Sum."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening for dinner and enjoyed some 'all day dim sum.' Food was good, but I don't think I'd ever return. The bowl still had hardened rice leftovers and a strand of hair sitting on the plate. Could have left but stayed as was too lazy. Food was good tho. Thus the three stars."}
{"text":"Went for dim sum on Sunday night. Had the shrimp shiu mai, har gow, beef ribs, turnip cake, curry squid, chicken and chive dumpling soup and the long noodle with the shrimp.  I liked them all but the standout was the shrimp dumpling. You can tell that they were made fresh. I was not too happy with the turnip cake as it didn't have too much ground pork in it.  For 2 people with a container of rice, it came to about $45 including taxes and tip.  I will definitely go back. Good to have a dim sum place in the city when you don't feel like driving to Markham or R. Hill."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and staff. Basically a dive. Looking for more to say because the yelp app says my review is too short but there is nothing really to say. Very poor experience all around."}
{"text":"I use to frequent this place during my university yrs and early 20s.  Met a friend there today and ran into my neighbour who happen to be seated next to our table.  Looking back I realized the service we received from initially walking in was a tell tale sign of how things would unfold.    A staff member pointed us to the back of the restaurant where the 2nd dinning rm was.  There another female staff in a green vest says in cantonese for me to wait to be seated. A server in front with a white shirt signals me to be seated 3 tables over, I take one step forward and the lady in green says don't move until I tell you where to sit.  I tell her another lady infront signalled me to be seated, she looks and spks to the other lady to confirm and let's me proceed.  My friend arrives and we order about 8 dishes.  We count 7 dishes and was missing one.  By this time my neighbour arrives and is seated next to us coincidently.  We ask the lady in green about the last dish, recalling a mushroom bean curd wrap we ordered that has yet to arrive.  She goes to check in the kitchen, meanwhile another lady brings us the missing dish within 1 minute.  My friend and I realized we were too full to eat it so I offered my neighbour the dish.  Shortly after i put it on their table, the same lady in green walks out and says loudly we never ordered the dish to begin with hense it was not delivered.  All the while throwing the order form on my table for 2 seconds before taking it back.  As if i can review it that quickly.  Then proceeds to take the dish in question away.  I tell her it's ok and to leave it there and that it would be my treat to the ladies beside me.  She gives me the dirtiest look and says no you didn't order it so don't bother treating anyone.  Then quickly proceeds to take the dish back to the kitchen.  I was in shock.  First of all we wanted that dish hence we ordered it, if we ordered the wrong one she didn't give us the opportunity to clarify correct or add.  Secondly I wanted to treat my neighbour and she said no!  Wow!  Never again will I step foot into this place. She treated me like a child, almost scolding me and absolutely disrespectful.  We don't live in the area but frequent it for lunch.  Next time I want dim sum we will be heading elsewhere.  The food itself was nothing special.  Usually they leave a yellow copy of the order on the table so u can confirm that you have recieved your complete order.  Not so in this case."}
{"text":"Definitely appreciated the no-frills quality of this restaurant.  My server barely spoke English, but it's ok because we both spoke the language of FOOD.  I ordered the Deep Fried Tentacles, half because I actually really enjoy squid and/or octopus (whichever one they would turn out to be), and half because the name of the dish really amused me.  It was exactly what you think it would be.  Hot, greasy, delicious.  Then ordered the Siu Mai, steamed shrimp dumplings, and the shrimp rice dumplings.  I ordered Crab and Pork Soup Dumplings... thinking it was the soup dumplings I'm familiar with in NYC, where there's scalding hot but delicious soup inside the dumpling... but instead, it was a bowl of soup with a very large blob of dumpling in it.  Difficult to eat and a sore disappointment from my expectations...  Also, the bakery next door was pretty awesome.  Wait, let me go write a review on that one separately..."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday lunch. Waited for 30mins.  Ordered sticky rice, deep fried pork dumplings, pan fried dumplings, steamed dumplings, calamari, & milk tarts!  Total of $27++ for 2 people and we got enough food and price is on point.  Heads up! They charge you for tea (even though they instantly put it on your table without asking if you want it). It is written in very small font on menu that they do charge for it (but also menu given right AFTER they give you the tea) 60cents/person in the table.   A lot of people are complaining about customer service. Some waitresses are nice. But hey, pls do understand that they get really busy at times and they have so much on their plate already so.. might as well.. Ask for everything you need, order whatever that you want all at once.   Would I come back despite the long wait? YAAAAAAAS. For sure!!"}
{"text":"One of the best dim sum I've ever had! They come steamy hot just the way I like them. :D  We ordered: -Har gow (shrimp dumplings)  -Siu mai (pork dumplings)  -Bamboo fungus and mushroom dumplings -A soup containing some crab meat, shrimps and a pork dumpling wrapped in a lettuce  -Lotus leaf sticky rice   I thought all the dishes were really good except the soup took a little getting used to of the taste. Dumplings were all yummy goodness.    Food was 5 stars out of 5 stars. Service was fast. My boyfriend did warn me that this place is not your typical date spot though. They didn't have the best tea or the best tablecloth but who needs either of it when you got delish dumplings. Go for food, not atmosphere. I'd definitely come here for dim sum again and I'd try their non-dim sum food as well. They accept credit cards for bills over $20."}
{"text":"Came here after a less than special experience at another restaurant on the same strip, with friends one late Saturday night.   We were greeted by friendly staff and even though it was past 10pm, people were coming in and filling the tables.   We went for the holy trinity of dim sum: the  Sui Mai pork dumplings (my favourite), the how gar shrimp, and the sticky rice with pork meat wrapped in a warm lotus leaf-like opening a yummy steaming present!   We also got pork fried rice and some sort of sizzling beef and veggies in a sauce which we saw being delivered to another table, and just had to ask for-the smell wafting was killing us! Both were enjoyable and the meat was tender.   Good conversation, yummy food and funny staff makes me want to come back again!"}
{"text":"I've come to this dim sum restaurant for about three years since I moved to the GTA.  In many ways the quality of GTA Chinese Dim Sum is tops in Eastern Canada followed by Montreal.  Alternately, you'd have to go out west.  This is a no frills dim sum place and the food does not disappoint.  As in my previous reviews on dim sum the litmus test consists of three staples that a restaurant must not, cannot, and should not fail.  The holy trinity is Har Gow (shrimp dumpling), Sui Mai (pork dumpling), and Sticky Rice in lotus leaf.  In short, Rol San passes with flying colours as the flavours are on the mark as is the texture.  Keep in mind this is your typical plastic over the table, no nonsense Chinese restaurant.  If that turns you off then the place is not for you.  Otherwise, enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.  Rating 4/5 (minus one for the condition of the rest room)."}
{"text":"Their shrimp dimsum are tasty and affordable. Very clean too. Definitely will visit next time when i crave dimsum"}
{"text":"This is now my favourite dim sum place after the one one dundas (seafood noble house) closed down. I've been here multiple times and they have delivered each and every time, that is why the restaurant is so packed. This time, my friends ordered something new and I really enjoyed it:  steamed pork meat and crab meat soup dumpling  fried eggplant with stuffed shrimp in soy sauce  pan fried prok dumplings  pan fried bean curds skin rolls  these new dishes were very flavourful and delicious...but then again can you really go wrong with dim sum? their originals (sui mai, har gow, squid tentacles, fried shrimp dumplings) were really good also. I'd recommend trying a new dish when you go for dimsum cuz it might just blow your mind!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had a pretty good experience.   We ordered 8 dishes and it ended up being around $38. The portions are pretty generous and we did end up having leftovers so we thought it was worth it, though it is a little more expensive than normal for a dim sum place.   The shumai was probably our favorite and I would definitely recommend getting that.   The soup dumplings come with around six in a soup bowl, they aren't like the soup dumplings that are filled with soup but are still super good.   Everything else was pretty standard dim sum, if you get the fried fish fillet, it comes with 6 pieces which was a good deal.   All of the other dumplings and desserts we got were pretty good.   Service wasn't too friendly but they were fast and we got our food in a very timely manner. The tea served with the food.   I would definitely coming here if you're looking for standard dim sum (except without the dim sum carts)."}
{"text":"Great dim sum and prices. Always fast service and open very late. Har gow and pork buns are staples."}
{"text":"I have been going to Rol San it seems like forever.  My favourite dish is hands down the spicy chicken with scallops and crispy seaweed.  Yes, it did give me food poisoning once many many moons ago, but that was not enough to turn me off of it for long. And their spicy squid is so damn good too.  Today I went with my parents for dim sum... as usual I got  my lunch favs - the shrimp rice rolls, shrimp and chive cakes, and sesame balls and all were perfect.  But I can't say the same about the dining experience.  As anyone who has dined there before knows, there is nothing fancy about this place.  The eardrum splitting noise of dishes and cutlery being gathered up in the top layer of the stack of plastic table cloths is constantly jarring.  The fact that there seems to be no smaller tables in the front dining room so sometimes two or even three parties are forced to share a large family sized round table.  The general noise level is a little maddening.  I know all this like the back of my hand, yet I keep coming back.  A lot of people are telling me to give up on Rol San in favour of Asian Legend.  I don't know.  I guess I'll try it and see what I think.  Or I could keep going to Rol San... it just comes to down accepting the fact that I can't go at any time when the majority of the rest of the population wants to eat lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've had both dim sum and many dinners at Rol San.  There aren't a lot of options for decent dim sum in Chinatown so when we're meeting friends that can't drive to Markham or Scarberia, we suggest Rol San because of it's easy accessible location.  We'll generally try to go a bit earlier than prime dim sum hours but on this particular Saturday, we arrived right at noon.  We were directed to the back room and given a number.  Surprisingly a table for 3 became available after only 10 min. of waiting.  I like the check-list style of dim sum because all the food arrives hot and fresh.  I did have to keep an eye on dishes coming to the table because I've noticed that there's an issue with bringing either the wrong dishes ordered or not bringing them at all.  So we counted up the number of dishes we were expecting and mentally made note of how many arrive.  We usually order 9-12 of the common dim sum dishes.  Price comes out to roughly  $40 with taxes and tip."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. That one star taken off... I'll explain later.  We arrived here on a Monday at lunch time hungry and excited. I've noticed its high reviews on Yelp and Google Maps so it was now time for me to check out the buzz.  We ordered the classics: siu mai, har gow, chicken feet, and spare ribs in black bean sauce. The siu mai was plump and juicy. It contained a lot of flavour unlike the ones I've tried at other dim sum joints. I love the har gow only because the shrimp was so juicy and the dumpling skin wasn't too thick. Spare ribs, like the siu mai, were extremely flavourful as well. I loved the chicken feet the most. It just was so nostalgic to smell the wonderful flavours of the dish. It had at the right amount of sweetness and saltiness. They also gave us a huge portion of it!   We ordered some other dishes just to try it as we usually don't eat these as often. They included the pork meat and shrimp dumpling, fried bean curd and shrimp paste, deep fried chicken wing, deep fried taro puffs stuffed with pork meat, and the baked milk tart. The chicken was RAW (minus one star), the shrimp paste was phenomenal, deep fried taro puffs were interesting but I came to love the flavour ~ definitely getting that again! The dumpling was okay. My favourite was the milk tart. What a decadent custard that instantly melted in your mouth! I love the flakiness of the tart. This was such a yummy treat!"}
{"text":"We came for - of course- dim sum during a bustling Sunday lunch. I was slightly disappointed to see that they didn't have the rolling carts, but I got over it quickly. Despite the plethora of seafood and meat dumplings on the menu, ordering dishes for the vegetarian in our midst did not prove challenging in the least. We probably ordered many items that are not \"typical\" of dim sum (e.g. no har gao, no siu mai, lo bak goh, etc) but there were plenty of delicious offerings in the form of crispy tofu-skin rolls, steamed vegetarian dumplings, plain cheong fun rice noodles, flaky custard pastries and melt-in-your-mouth fried sticky rice balls with black sesame. The meat eaters also sampled shrimp and veggie dumplings and BBQ pork buns. We all left completely stuffed for $10/pp. I'm withholding my last star for next time when I try the more typical dim sum dishes, but dang it if they didn't all look mouthwateringly good."}
{"text":"After hearing multiple recommendations of this place, I finally had the chance to check out what the buzz is about. It is definitely worth going to if you want some dim sum! All the dishes are SO flavorful and delicious!! It can get packed so go there during off times. The great thing about this place is that they serve dim sum till 2AM! I highly recommend this place if you're in Toronto for some good dim sum!"}
{"text":"If you like dim sum, this place is pretty authentic. The food taste great! Dinning environment is good except they don't serve the dim sum in the traditional way--pushing food carts around for you to choose, because of the size of the restaurant. You order with an order sheet with descriptions, which may not be a bad idea for people other than Chinese if you are not very familiar with all kinds of dim sum. The only things are the service is a bit slow and the restroom is not very pleasant to use, which was the reason that I gave the place only 3 stars."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT HERE!  SERIOUSLY!!!  I have gotten SICK everytime I have made the mistake of allowing someone to convince me to go to Rol San.  Just DON'T!"}
{"text":"\"Wait, I'm only just about to review Rol San now?\" - That was the sentence screaming in my head a few seconds ago after realizing I had not yet reviewed probably the sit-down restaurant I frequent the most in the city. A place where I've ate at twice already the past week. A place that I should have reviewed first instead of stupid ass Pacific Mall.  MARK, YOU DUMB ASS!!!...  Well, that's enough with the being angry at myself, on to the review....  Like I said before, Rol San is probably the restaurant to hold the honour of feeding my fat ass more than any other restaurant. I've ate here as late as 2 at night, as early as 4 in the morning and I ate at every single table including the ones at the back room, and when you see that this place is never empty, you know you're doing something right. This joint and Swatow are the two restaurants in Chinatown that have a deep seated place in my heart. Unlike Swatow though, I really think the food here is delicious even when I'm sober*.   They don't go out of there way to say it, but this place specializes in dim sum. You can tell by the way they serve it all day long or how busy this place is during proper dim sum hours. The dim sum here is some of the best I had in the city.  Since you have to order it here instead of picking it off a cart, your food comes out super fresh. The siu mai is savoury and comes with fish roe on top of it which makes it even better. The har gow is excellent and the deep fried squid tentacles are so soft and are mildly sweet.   The more traditional offerings are pretty solid too. They do their seafood dishes right and their soups hit the spot all the time. The noodle dishes though can be hit or miss. Ordering a seafood chow mein can mean ordering chow mein with a lot of veggies with a couple of shrimps on it; pretty bad meat to veggie ratio.  Service is hit or miss here too.  The dim sum ladies working weekend mornings are in the miss spectrum. They will at times ignore you so much, that you just want to walk out and leave. They also mix up orders but that I can understand considering how much stuff is leaving the kitchen during weekend mornings. The guys at night though, including the one and only Ming, are some of the best in town. They're fast, attentive and super friendly.   Lastly, this place is super clean as far as eateries in Chinatown goes. They do have plastic table coverings but I wouldn't mind bringing a date here (albeit not a first date).  *Yes, I know I did give Swatow a star too much because of the nostalgia I get rather than the quality but it just wouldn't be fair in my heart. Sometimes, you can't help being a little bias.   Review TL;DR?..well in summary...Good food, good service equals good rating."}
{"text":"My favourite dim sum place in Chinatown. Other places have soggy har gau and siu mai. The decor is decent except for the plastic patio chairs they use at the tables. The price of dim sum is mid range and definitely not too overpriced. They do not have egg tarts which is one of my favourite dim sum dishes. If you are going on weekends, go early, there will be a line. Service was attentive and the server refilled our tea very quickly."}
{"text":"Every trip from Buffalo we stop at Rol San.... casual, fast, efficient   We typically eat dim sum with a plate of fried rice  Deluxe won ton soup starter was nearly a meal for two.  Plenty of American and Chinese vegetables crowding the won tons.     Pros: Hottest spicy oil in Toronto.  Shu Mai  Shrimp dumpling BBQ spareribs  Steamed pork buns  Excellent BBQ fried rice   Cons: Dim sum has turned into fast food.... order from a menu, they bring it to the table.... I liked the carts in the old days ;-(     and don't expect cloth tablecloths."}
{"text":"We had family visiting and they really wanted some good dim sum in downtown Toronto.  Seeing how most of the family had no cars, we couldn't really bring them up to Markham or Richmond Hill.  Someone mentioned Rol San and off we went for Chinese New Year dim sum.  This is one of the old stalwarts of Chinatown.  It's probably one of the best options here and probably the most cleanest as well.  Thank goodness someone booked the tables cause we saw the line up of waiting tables spill out into every part of the hallway and dining areas.  The staff was unpleasant at best.  It was near impossible to get their attention and when they did, they clearly were irritated.  Seeing how we're used to the curt but efficient service of most Chinese restaurants, this was FAR FAR worse.    Then menu has many of the dim sum standards... deep fried squid, cha siu bun, rice rolls filled with shrimp or beef, siu mai dumplings, and har gao.  We pretty much ordered over 24 dishes for our group of 12.  The first comment was that this was more expensive than the average good Markham places.  The food quality was ok... some of them clearly has been sitting in the steamers for a long period of time because the dumpling skins were gooey and fell apart easily while the pork inside was tough.  All the food did come very quickly so we were never left waiting for more food.    Overall, this isn't a bad place but it certainly doesnt match up to the good places in GTA East.  If I had a choice (and more cars to bring people places), i'd spend the extra 30 minutes driving to get better food and service."}
{"text":"After going to Rol San for the 3rd time, I had reaffirmed myself that their food is way too greasy for my liking. My gf and I felt weird in the stomach after we shared beef tenderloin Chinese style and fried vermicelli. Whenever I'm in Chinatown, I prefer to go to Ajisen. The quality of food at Ajisen is consistently good and their pork ramen is one of the best in town, if not THE best. I have yet to find a good Chinese restaurant in Chinatown with tasty and non-greasy items on the menu."}
{"text":"Rol San is being downgraded to a 3 star for me. Not because anything has CHANGED at Rol San per say, but merely because I've discovered there is really a lot better dim sum around, even downtown.  Dim Sum King Seafood which opened up on Dundas West recently definitely has better food quality and the prices are on par, if not cheaper, than Rol San.  Rol San is still a reasonable option if you want All Day Dim Sum, but don't expect to be blown away by the food, unless you are a dim sum newbie!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to dim-sum place! It's affordable and delicious. if you're coming with a large group of people, you can order a large variety of items without being broke. I would recommend going here for some cheap Sunday dim-sum."}
{"text":"We ordered the fried rice, duck in plum sauce and a few dim sum dishes between two people. It was wayyyy too much as the portions are pretty big. Had leftovers for days. I enjoyed the fried rice and duck in plum sauce but the dim sum was not that great which was what I was excited about."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for many years. I also brought with me many a friend or family, that wanted to eat around this area (Spadina/Dundas). NEVER AGAIN!!  Not only has the staff become progressively ruder, but in all honesty, the food has been going downhill lately. Maybe there's new owners, maybe new chefs, but whatever it is, the food is mediocre at best. Too many other places in the area, to put up with rude service and poor food."}
{"text":"3.5 What is really great in this place is that the dumplings are not all looking or tasting like those usual ones you can eat everywhere (i.e. small, always shaped the same 3 or 4 different types). You will discover unexpected size, shapes, presentation and tastes. Congratulations! That being said, you wil encounter some really weird mixtures in some of these unusual dumplings, which do not allways fit with the basic palate and tastes. So great experience, good quality, but be prepared for unsual tastes, which you may not like sometimes.  Otherwise, they seem to have very nice, good looking and smelling sizzling plates."}
{"text":"Love Rol San, service is fast, food is definitely decent. Fairly reasonable prices depending on what time you show up."}
{"text":"This is the real deal.  Amazing variety of dim sum, authentic flavors and experience.  Price is also very reasonable at about $5-6 per selection.  Be ready to wait a bit as this is a popular place, full of locals.  Classic dumplings have a tender yet firm outside, bursting with flavor inside."}
{"text":"Went back and once again all msg goo and shitty service The male server was great, the woman was argumentative and impatient"}
{"text":"Rol San is such a staple dim sum place in Chinatown. Even if you don't know the name of the restaurant (like myself for many years), it's always \"that place with the all day dim sum sign\". And for all day dim sum it's actually pretty good. The flavours are there and nothing tastes like it's been sitting out for too long. I'm not a fan of fried foods but the deep fried tentacles are a must here - crispy and never too oily. This place is always busy but the turnover rate is actually pretty fast. It's pretty effective that they just wrap all the dirty dishes up with the tablecloth and then it's onto the next. This place is open late and serves a wide variety of Chinese food aside from dim sum."}
{"text":"My old stomping grounds... I just has to stop in to see how things are. One thing's for sure, business hasn't slowed down a bit! The place is still packed. Reservations will help a little, you'll be put to the front of the line, but they won't seat you until your entire party is present. So make sure your entire party is punctual.  If you're a night owl, the place is open 24/7 and they serve dim sum anytime. I used to frequent it afterwards when I worked afternoons, but since my career changed, it's been mostly dim sum when I'm downtown.  My Chinese and Dim Sum scene has transferred to the GTA over the years, so its been several years since I've been back to the downtown core, and lots have changed. It's really not Chinatown anymore, it more like Asiatown as there are many Vietnamese shops and restaurants.  The dim sum was decent, but not exactly how I remembered it. Disappointingly I remembered it being better. The Har Gow (shrimp dumplings) were small and not as juicy as I remembered. The fried bean curd was mushy, the flavour of the fried turnip was off, and the deep fried squid tentacles were fully battered! Some of the dishes that still remained on par include the chicken feet, the fried shrimp dumplings, the steamed shrimp rice noodle wraps, the short ribs, shrimp and pork dumplings (shiu mai), and the beef tripe.  Overall, I would have to say I now prefer GTA dim sum. Perhaps I'll be back for an evening meal to see if that too has changed, but for dim sum, I'm giving Rol San 2,5 stars."}
{"text":"Literally all day good dimsum. The price isn't really the cheapest ($2.40/dish), and it isn't the best dimsum you can find in Toronto, in fact, some of which can be a little bland. But being able to have legitimate dimsum any time during the day or night, is A-OK to me."}
{"text":"I love me my cheap dim sum. I love it even more when it's served on a plastic covered table.   Whenever presented with this dining scenario, I can't help but zone out and imagine myself on a greasy slip-n-slide, hurtling through puddles of marginally dumplings, fried vittles, rice rolls, and accoutrements....yes.   So back to the actual point of this review: the place is really just kind of OK. The people who run the place are nice, but the service is pretty average. Some of the dishes are good, while others are, you know, not so much (shrimp rice rolls...blech). I'd love to know what people are actually expecting when they come here though, because it doesn't give off any air of it being anything more than what it looks like.   One thing I will say is that by virtue of the fact that this establishment can have all day service of dim sum and not be awful warrants them a damn trophy. That said though, if you're looking for some exceptional food, it's not really going to be found at Rol San."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and stuff were friends, but wish wasn't too crowded. They have fresh dim sum and speedy delivery"}
{"text":"Standard dimsum place. Great price, great food, and not the best service. They're rarely friendly, but who cares when their food is so good!   One guy spilt tea all over our table and didnt apologize and walked away. Another time another person just chucked out food on the table knocked a few dumplings out of its crate.  But hay, I leave that place completely satisfied in my tummy without having to completely empty out my wallet so that's all that matters.  On Chinese new year, my friend and I went and spent $90 on dimsum. We were at a communal table too so we got some surprised looks. We ended up taking 8 to go containers, while we munched down 8 plates in front of us.  It was a great day."}
{"text":"I've going to Rolsan on Spadina since forever.  Food is great but got pricey like everything else.  No problem.  When we got the bill it was $9.00 extra.  Must have been an honest mistake.  He apologized and issue solved.  We went back the 2nd, 3rd, 4th time and the same thing happened.  What the heck was happening here?  We looked around and realized that they are taking advantage of intoxicated party goers especially in large groups and charging them extra.  They write your order in Chinese with no price, just the final total.  NOTE TO ROLSAN:  We weren't drunk/high on anything.  You should have had better judgement since you're ripping people off every day.  Weekends specially.  Watch your bill everyone."}
{"text":"When a friend suggested Rol San for dim sum, I was disappointed because they don't do the carts. For me, a huge part of the fun of dim sum is stopping one of the carts, having the little grandma open up the steaming hot bamboo basket, peering at the dim sum, and finally nodding or shaking my head.  Still, I can't complain about the quality nor the price of the dim sum here. The dumplings were plump and juicy. I really enjoyed everything we ordered.   The restaurant is exceedingly loud and a bit disorganized. You receive a ticket and check off which and how many of the dim sum that you want. Then they deliver it to you as they are made. Check over your order carefully because they forgot a couple items that we had asked for. After we pointed it out, they speedily sent out the rest of our order.  I left stuffed and paid $12, which was a great deal considering that we ordered mainly seafood and a platter of Cantonese noodles."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this due to the raving reviews my friend kept giving me about this place. Went here during lunch time and the place was around half full. With tables covered with white plastic, the ambiance was like at any other Chinese restaurant. The food was mediocre, I wasn't wowed by anything, it had what other dim sum places offered as well. I'm glad that I did get to try it but I don't think I'd return."}
{"text":"Having moved to Toronto from the burbs... good dimsum is definitely hard to find in Toronto.  I've heard Rolsan was a place to try and after having dimsum in neighbourhoods like Markham and Scarborough that tastes substantially better, with more on the menu and half the price it's hard to make Rolsan one of my go-to places for dimsum."}
{"text":"Amazing dum sum in the heart of Toronto's Chinatown.  They were very efficient, and we loved everything we ordered.  We went on a Sunday around 11:15, and it was packed, but the friendly host got us a table within a few minutes.  Right after we sat down, though, the line was out the door!  Go early.  We liked the vegetarian steamed dumplings, the sesame balls, the dumpling soup, the pork short ribs in garlic sauce, and some tofu dish.  Everything was great, and I would absolutely go back next time I am in Toronto!  Also, for four people, the entire bill was $33.  Can't beat that."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places for Dim Sum in regards to the food. The service = not too much. The waiters are not attentive. I came here with my cousins a few days ago and our empty dishes were piling up. Many waiters walked by and yet none of them cleared it for us. The dishes were cleared when our other orders came.   Every time I come here, it is always packed. The restaurant is separated into two sections. Normally, for those who were going for the All-Day Dim Sum menu are seated in the back section. This room has no windows which seems pretty weird if you ask me. Anyway, those we were ordering Chinese dishes were generally seated in the front section.   The food will not disappoint you. Everything on the Dim Sum menu is delicious. They do not push carts around. Everything is ordered by penciling in the item and quantity.  Lastly, I only have an issue with their service. One thing that really bugged me was when the waiter came to take the bill away from me. The bill was right in front of me as I was counting cash from my wallet. It was really rude for her to just reach over for the bill.  Normally, waiters are notified by their customers when they are ready to be cashed out/not. That moment right there just restrained me from leaving her much tip."}
{"text":"This is a solid dim sum joint. No fancy trolleys, plastic table covers but good food comes fast. Here is my top 5 items from their menu starting with the most delicious. 1) Steamed BBQ Pork Buns 2) Sticky Rice 3) Fried Eggplant with Stuffed Shrimp 4) Deep Fried Squid Tentacles 5) Steamed Cuttlefish."}
{"text":"Ever heard of the switcheroo? Well, this Chinese restaurant was the equivalent of one. On the outside, this over-rated, over-priced place appears to be a busy all-day dim sum venue. On the inside, it's cramped, making you feel like domesticated cattle as you wait to be served subpar har gow and siu mai. As you stare around, dish after dish of unsatisfying greasiness, you can't help but ask \"Why the heck are all these people eating here? Is it just me?\" Never again.  Menu - 3 stars: There's a fairly large selection of dim sum and traditional Chinese food. You'll get a small checklist for you to pick from the most popular items. As for the larger dishes of chow mein and soups, ask for their larger menu.   Food - 2 stars: The har gow and siu mai arrived at our table warm. I thought this came straight from the kitchen - did our dish take the scenic route to our table? The first bite was the same as the rest: lacking flavour but portions are average.  Drink - 3 stars: Tea was standard and was cold. At every Chinese restaurant I've been to, tea is served piping hot but here, perhaps it's summer and management wanted to serve ice tea, but it arrived cold and our second pot was cold too.  Hours - 5 stars: 9:00 AM to 4:00 AM every single day of the year. Yes, even Christmas and Chinese New Years. But their poor staff and their families. It's no surprise that this place is a huge attraction for tourists looking for Chinese grub.  Location - 5 stars: You can't get better than this location. A skip, hop, or jump just north of Dundas and Spadina. You can see this joint when you take the streetcar southbound. Front parking is limited, so be ready to fight for a spot.  Wait Time - 3 stars: For a table of 5, we waited 15-20 minutes. Did you see how fast they turn their tables? Don't blink because they just grab the white plastic cloth with utensils and all, and voila, a clean new table for the next customer.  Service - 1 star: Service at most Asian restaurants are usually unfriendly with no pleasantries. This place was no different, but staff kept messing up our orders and placing more food on our table. Make sure to check what you ordered!  Venue - 3 stars: Large tables, all of which are covered in these white garbage bag covers that act as the linen - how classy. There's a room in the back for groups, but this doesn't mean you won't have to wait. It's another separate line!  Cleanliness - 3 stars: You won't see any dead rats here - not during the day at least but you won't see an IKEA kitchen either. The feeding troughs - I mean, dining area was free of litter and the kitchen looked well maintained. Hooray!  Washrooms - 2 stars: I've peed in worst venues. The toilets are located in the back, after the main dining hall. Can anyone spell tripping hazard? Outside the washrooms are boxes and garbage bags. It's their new free obstacle course!  House Rules - 3 stars: Cash or credit. Most restaurants don't take debit because it costs them too much. Not a huge annoyance for the expert foodie, who's always ready to deal with such mishaps, but they could have posted a sign.  Cost - 2 stars: For 5 people, the bill came to about $60, not a considerable amount but when you factor in the inconvenience of having to plug our nose every time we had to swallow their MSG-laddened food, it felt like highway robbery.  X factor - 1 star: The only thing memorable about this place was their pasty cold dim sum. No warm smile, no thank yous, and careless servers. Management needs to focus more on the dining experience rather than turning tables.  Rol San Restaurant, if you are the best dim sum restaurant that Chinatown has to offer, then this is tragic news. My advice to Yelpers is to stay clear or expect disappointment. Advice to management is to have a ticket system where people wait outside of the restaurant, instead of creating a fire hazard. Secondly, ensure that staff are correctly filling orders and not overcharging. For those thinking a bustling venue means good food, be in for an unsavoury surprise."}
{"text":"On our second visit we took our friends as they've never been here. We ordered our typical fare and everything was delicious and came out fast. Water was refilled often and as well as tea. The best part... between  4 of us it came to 60.00 ... what me and husband usually spend.  Totally coming with friends from now on! Filling yummy and cheap as always!"}
{"text":"they send out food quicker than you can say ho fun. this place is great for that late night craving of chinese food after a night of heavy drinking in the entertainment district (10 min walk). ive never waited in line longer than 5 minutes even during the peak hours of 2-3 am. I suggest having the corn soup, cantonese chow mein,  and any of their stir fried veggie dishes. the service is fairly quick because they have a lot of staff and no single waiter is dedicated to any table. you can wave down any waiter for service. well worth the money for this chinese joint"}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best Dim Sum place I've tried. I think this place is even better than a lot of the LA or NYC places. Price is very reasonable with the quality of the Dim Sum. Service is okay but that's what you expected when you go to a Dim Sum place. Definitely a long wait during weekend. They tend to seat large group (5+ people) first than small groups even if you are top of the list which was a bit annoying. Accept Visa or Cash. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who's planning to visit Toronto."}
{"text":"First off, we didn't order any dim sum so I cannot comment on that. The food we ordered was good, but for whatever reason the plain rice took forever to arrive even after reminding the waiter. That's a let down since you don't want to wait until your dishes get cold to have rice. When we were leaving, my friend had some communication difficulties with the cashier. The cashier was being really pushy for a big tip which soured my friend's mood. I'll chalk that up to a one-time incident here hopefully."}
{"text":"I love this place. Open almost 24h in weekends, if you go there at 2:00am on Saturday night you may think you got confused and think it's lunch hour..  Awesome food, good service;  My favorites: Ginger Crispy Beef (it's sweet and spicy) and Hot and Sour soup."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with dim sum at 1am? Rol San has served to me what is delicious fresh shrimp dumplings, which are my favorite. I have yet to try better dumSum but I'm sure there is much to explore. I recommend this place for the Space, service, speediness and affordability."}
{"text":"Best dim sum in downtown Toronto, I feel like I'm in Hong Kong. Dishes are cheap and arrive at your table piping hot. Yeah they probably do use MSG but so do most Chinese and Korean restaurants pretty much...everywhere. Rol San is not for the health conscious."}
{"text":"I dont even care that this place is full of drunk holligans at 3 am!  The food is amazing, the waiters HATE everyone there, and they will kick out other tables to get new people in.  For years I've been eating their crispy ginger beef and I still love it.  So tasty, but not good warmed up the next day.  They also have amazing garlic bok choy, fried rice, chicken and all sorts of stuff.  I am not a daring chinese food eater, but I see some tables with wacky food and they seem to love it.  Rol San for life !"}
{"text":"The yummiest dim sum of them all. Although it's not your typical uptown cheap $2/dish dim sum places, it definitely holds itself in terms of value + quality.  Get ready to wait in line for quite some time tho.  Tip: ** Weekends are normally very busy but if you head straight into the restaurant, you'll find a section in the back that has their own waiting list."}
{"text":"Was in there on a Sunday and as expected it was crazy busy. None the less I waited twenty plus minutes for a table for two. After my experience there that day I don't think I'll be going back.   I've been to Rol San countless of times to the point of having \"regular\" status. The food is good and affordable. Service is most of the time not great but sometimes they will surprise you (watch out for this one guy who \"runs the show\". Totally rude. Hate him). Also, minor detail, they serve you tea and charge you for it even when you don't order it. Those things never deterred me from going there because I liked the cheap food and it's open really late.  I've heard of stories of people being over charged and I stupidly thought since I had been going for years and they knew my face it would never happen to me. Well it did. They added an extra item to the bill. It arrived at the table and when I said I didn't order it the \"show runner\" showed me the ordering card and there was a 1 next to this item. What total bullshit. Paid for it anyway as I couldn't prove I didn't order it. Then they begged for a better tip. Go Fuck yourselves.   Don't go here. Rol San is bullshit. Go to Noble Seafood around the corner on Dundas west of Spadina. Better. And nicer atmosphere. And they don't have the shitty plastic on the tables. Or that shitty guy."}
{"text":"Rol San Restaurant may be the best option to have dim sum in Chinatown.. But as an uptowner that frequent dim sum restaruant up in Scarborough, Markham and Richmond Hill, it is really not up to par.  I might be cheap.. but when I am used to all sizes one price for a late Sunday afternoon dim sum fix that is $1.60/$1.80/$2.0/$2.20... paying $3.68 for a Siu Mai or Hai Gow is really a lot!! With that price range.. I would have high expectations! But sadly they really don't deliver.  The only thing going to Rol San is the all day dim sum.. so if you are partying hard downtown and want to have a dim sum fix, this is the place to go!!  The service here is slow and impersonal... I really jumping up and down do a dance spin around in order to get some services!   I agreed with Neil... 50% eating here are non Chinese....wondering where they are going for dim sum.  I would come back if it is a yelp event since having fun eating with all the yelpers more than compensate for the food.. but it will not be the restaurant I would go to for my dim sum fix!  They accepts Visa and Mastercard."}
{"text":"I am going to keep it short, honest and be blunt.  After reading the reviews, that this place has been getting, I thought I would give my feedback after being here 4-5 times now in the past 6 months.  If you come here, prepare to get sub standard service.  You have to realize that majority of the servers here do NOT speak english and are getting paid WAY below the normal server wage.  The food IS great! You can't complain about the food prices either because it is really affordable.  The management can be hostile at the end of the meal.  Each time I come in to eat, after paying, the manager always counts the tips to make sure that we tipped.  On my second time here, Our bill came out to 80$ and not once did the server come to our table with water that we asked for since we arrived.  I decided since the service was poor at that time to only tip 10$.  The manager demanded that I give more for tips and would not let me leave.  Come for the food but don't expect much service."}
{"text":"I have to say this is some of the best dim sum I have had in a while! Tasty and nice sized servings.  I will definitely be back when I am in this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"The food here is good. Slightly better than the alternatives down the street on Spadina. The service is a bit better as well. They do have some questionable practices (more so deeper into the night or if they see that you've been drinking). On multiple occasions I've had bills with extra charges but they're always quick to 'fix' the 'error'. The dim sum is decent enough but it looks like it's not fresh as they run out of some dishes sometimes."}
{"text":"WE SERVE DIM SUM. Yes, yes they do. Delicious dim sum at that. Dim sum that you get to order off a list of items described in mangled English, instead of constantly trying to get the attention of the woman with the cart. But once you figure out what each thing is, it's heaven.  The staff are really attentive and nice, although this could be because they recognize me now from going so often. Regardless, the food is great, you can eat for two for under $25 (depending how hungry you are) and the food comes really really fast, so you can be in and out on a lunch break (I've done it before!).  I think it's one of the more reasonably priced dim sum places downtown, but it's not cheap compared to uptown dim sum. If you can travel, go up and over to Scarborough or Markham because you can get much better (and crazy cheap) dim sum.  And don't go to Rol San for anything except dim sum...New Ho King is just down the street and is wayyy tastier."}
{"text":"Visited from the US and was looking for a place for dim sum on a Sunday morning. Got there around 10ish. They weren't very busy, was able to get a table right away. No push carts, ordered from paper. Service was great. Didn't have to wait long for the food. Food was good. Just a typical dim sum place, nothing super outstanding, but nothing horrible.   Giving it 4 stars because when I was searching I was a little hesitant to try this place due to he 3.5 star rating, but after reading the comments from the low ratings, I decided the issues are that it's a typical dim sum restaurant in Chinatown. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Fresh dim-sum in Chinatown, and it opens till very late. The shrimp dumplings and pork buns are my favorite"}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant at around 1 pm and it was packed! The restaurant is pretty clean, especially given the fact that it is in the heart of Chinatown. I was expecting the food to be amazing given the lineup, but I was slightly disappointed. The food was decent, but definitely not the best dim sum I have ever had."}
{"text":"I like this place. I think it's one of the better dim sum places around the china town area. The food is pretty good and it's cheap, I'd say around $15 each time per person. It gets really packed during busy hours and in large groups I recommend reserving. I often reserve for 20+ people and they'll definitely split you up into two tables. You fill your dim sum order on a sheet and they come at a super fast pace, the waiters are really efficient even if they're not that smiley.  I'd recommend getting deep fried taro dumplings, har how, siu Mai, squid tentacles, and their milk custard egg tarts are lovelyyyy. All the other classic dishes are decent too, I haven't ran into anything I wouldn't eat or consider terrible. Their custard bun could be better. Wish they had the egg yolk custard bun though!"}
{"text":"I have been to Rol San a couple of times in the past, and have been overcharged 3/4 times. Those experiences definitely left a sour taste in my mouth and I didn't return until last weekend (after a year). Being overcharged by $8 the first time around was okay as we chalked it up as a server's miscalculation. However, being overcharged by a few dollars ($10+) on each of the other two visits (on separate occasions) has gotten me concerned about their practices so I didn't bother to return. Instead of Rol San, we usually alternate between these three; Rosewood, Dim Sum King, or Noble Seafood in Chinatown. I am not the only one who have had this issue, as there are quite a lot of online reviews out there that have indicated this as well.   Despite their lack of service or final bill discrepancies; Rol San has remained a popular dim sum establishment in Chinatown. I can definitely see why as they do offer all day dim sum, and the food was tasty here. As an added note; tea is an additional 60 cents per person.  The prices are relatively standard to a restaurant offering all day dim sum, and our meal was a little over thirty dollars. I actually did enjoy the food here as I found it rather flavorful, and the shrimp that they used for both the shrimp dumplings and rice rolls were plump and delicious. As for service; the main server didn't do much as all he did was stand at the front counter, and lurked around. Our food was brought out from the kitchen in a rather fast manner by one of the kitchen staff, which is good as it came out hot. Nothing much has changed in a year; good food and mediocre service."}
{"text":"The food portions were pretty big however the taste wasn't as good as it looked. The place is pretty clean for a Chinese restaurant. I would come back again if the dim sum places around were not open."}
{"text":"Worth the wait and the lack of service. The food here is *that* good - at least for the price.  Highly recommend the lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice, pork buns and the shrimp and mushroom dim sums.  SO good."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a quite a few years, and amusingly the inside hasn't changed one bit. It's still very retro-Chinese, plastic table covers included. The siu mai and har gow are still great, although the har gow have shrunk considerably, but at least they seemed to have kept the prices consistently low. The stick rice in lotus leaves is still amazing. The soup with shrimp and crab meat dumpling was not what I expected. I thought it was xiao long bao but instead it was a massive dumpling in a bowl of soup. That was the only \"okay\" dish of the night. Otherwise, this place is still pretty great and an excellent value."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Every time I come back to Toronto, I go to Rol San with my dad and sister.   To start off with, this place is always busy. And I mean always. What my family and I usually do is go around 10:30pm before the actual brunch crowd gets in and there is a huge wait line.  We usually get seated within five minutes if we get there before 10:45. We made the mistake of getting there around 11 and it was packed.  The place is fairly clean and they've recently did renovations. The bathrooms are quite small and inbetween the front and back of the restaurant. The decorations and paintings are quite nice and there are a lot specials on the board, but you should really focus on the dim sum here.  It was my first time here since August, and man, have the prices skyrocketed. Some of the prices went up by almost 30% and I even noticed that the portion sizes shrank. It was kind of a bummer (Even tea is now 80 cents a person rather than 60 cents!) to see how much the prices had gone up and the portions going down, especially since the food quality did not improve and neither did the service. The food gets there staggeringly, so sometimes it's like having a course meal and you have to be careful.   Be careful to check your bill and make sure that they are giving you what you asked for (we usually take a photo of the bill we fill out with the food) and to make sure they are not billing you for more than you wanted.   I will however say that the food quality did not go down and it has always been pretty good to begin with. It is delicious!   Some of my favourites: - Siu mai - deep fried taro  - rice rolls with beef - pork sticky rice in leaf - ha gao (but it is really small portions I warn you) - Chicken feet (It's good I promise, keep an open mind) - black bean spare ribs - Deep fried shrimp chive cakes (Really good, they have mayo with it)  Not sure if I would go again as there are other better places there, but it's always a good staple.   Tip: There is a back as well, so when you get in and the front is filled up, try going to the back to see how full/empty it is. You have to go to a server and give them the number of people you have and you'll get a number, so make sure to pay attention."}
{"text":"My second favourite Dim Sum restaurant in T.O. If you show up on the weekend make sure you get here before 11:45. At noon, the rest of Toronto shows up in search of steamed and fried excellence.   No carts: you mark down your selection and it shows up in a flash. I'm a big fan of the steamed pork buns, shrimp dumplings, and their desserts. Like most of the offerings in Chinatown, the prices are reasonable. Bonus: they offer a few large round tables, which is helpful for groups.  Obligatory Title Pun: ROLL on in!  Menu Readability: Let's face it, layout isn't really a big deal when you can't read Chinese. There's English as well though, and it's sufficiently descriptive.  Need to mention: I'm serious about getting here on time.    What this place teaches me about myself: I'm late for a lot of things, but Dim Sum is not one of them."}
{"text":"Second time trying dim sum. This place was really busy and the staff were really fast and helpful. Only issue I had is this is cash only but they clearly state that on the door and there is an atm two doors down. Got seated right away and we ordered a variety of items. We ordered 8 items but for two people got full on five totalling $40 and we had a bunch of food left over. Great value and all of it was amazing. Only complaint was towards the end the food was taking long to come out after we got full and paid the bill we were still waiting on 3 items to arrive and pack. And after we paid the bill we asked about the other items and they asked \" do you still want them \" as if they weren't planning on giving them to us and we said yes as it was still a lot of food to take home and we were paying for. So that was the only thing I found a little odd. Aside from that super good food with a homy feel."}
{"text":"Best Siu Mai I had in the longest time;juicy, tasty, meaty and not overly salty. Ahh i am craving for it again!   The sesame ball with sesame paste was excellent!!!   Deep fried squid tentacles were not that great. But really, I shouldn't be ordering that if I am here to eat real dim sum.   Chicken feet was amazing! The sauce was not too starchy and sweet. Just the right amount of balance  Spring roll with taro and pork were good but really not my kind of dim sum dish.   I like how everything came out fresh and piping hot from the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Our first time at this place.  We thought the price was inexpensive, food was good, service less than okay, the ambiance was okay.  Overall we give it A-OK.    There were no push carts.  We ordered everything off a menu sheet.  The items on their Dim Sum menu ranged between 2 dollar and change to $3.98.  We ordered like 8 small dim dishes that was enough for the four of us.  The stick rice with check was pretty good and delicious.  It was fresh because it wasn't mushy.  Shrimp dumplings were good, filled with big shrimp and no fluffs.  Sium mia was good.  Rice cake with daikon radish (low bok gow) was good and fresh.  It wasn't too greasy.  Stem pork ribs with black bean sauce was okay.      Service was okay.  We asked for Chrysanthemum tea.  It was too light for us and it didn't come with rock sugar.  The servers were very busy.  Beside dish out the dim sum when they were ready, they didn't bother to check on us.  We asked to refill our tea but it wasn't filled till we already paid the check.    We would probably come back here again if we are in the area and need something quick to eat.  We probably would skip this place if there was a line outside."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Atmosphere: 2/5 Service: 1/5  Passable food, but absolutely terrible service, and even worse payment options. Does not take any form of payment other than cash and Visa. No debit for some odd, unexplainable reason (even when banks have upgraded their debit cards these days to Visa Debit). Nope. Rol San does not recognize the 21st century.  Took about 10 mins to get our Har Gow, another 20 to get our Siu Mai, with us being very patient the whole time. And then the waiter yells at us for not paying via one of the many options we offered (debit, MasterCard, AMEX, cash).  We ended up putting down a bunch of cash to cover our bill (without a 15-20% tip like they were expecting), and they yelled at us loudly in Cantonese as if we understood wtf they were saying (we didn't - we  speak Mandarin and English and French - oops).  Not cool. And not appreciated, especially as a regular patron. Will not be visiting again, will go next door to one of the many other restaurants nearby instead.  Thanks. Bye!"}
{"text":"Rol San is so far the best dim sum restaurant I've been to in downtown Toronto (sample size of 2). Don't be fooled by the looks of this place from the outside, there's plenty of seating inside. We were able to seat a group of 8 without a wait for a weekday lunch. We ordered the usual: various rice rolls (shrimp, beef, and chicken?!), various dumplings, various buns, eggplant, etc. The food itself is not as high quality as the dim sum you could get in the GTA, but it tasted great. Rol San is one of those places where you order dim sum off a menu, which is great because I'm not a fan of push cart dim sum. The only annoying thing that I noticed was that they didn't cut food on some of the dishes, but instead handed us a knife and fork and told us to cut it ourselves. Lunch came out to $11 per person."}
{"text":"This place has been around for ages.  If you need some all day dimsum at anytime of the day then this is the place.  Food is okay and you get the classic dimsum dishes which is great.  It's a great place to eat for those late night adventures."}
{"text":"Chaotic...so get there early (we arrived at 11... when we left, we could barely exit the restaurant). We had a 20 min wait at 11 on a Sunday.  Food is decent-- lots of \"bun\"... but the cha siu bao filling was great. Nai wong was lacking.. the shu mai was big, juicy, and tasty... the chai siu in the pastry was deliciuos. the fried taro/veggie thing was excellent... the pumpkin custardy thing was decent-- pretty filling...  At the end we left stuffed...though, the 2 of us did order 8 dishes.  It was better than I was expecting (I think DC has bad dim sum, and am a huge fan of dim sum just outside of SF), except for the wierdos that kept pointing at the dishes we ordered next to us. C'mon I understand it may be your first time to dim sum, but I'd much rather have someone ask me what i was eating/ordered instead of pointing and making judgmental comments about it."}
{"text":"With a dim sum restaurant on (what seems like) every corner in Chinatown, it can be hard to know where to go. Let the massive line-up be your guide: look no further than Rol San!   We came in at lunchtime on a Monday afternoon, and the place was PACKED. The system for seating is a bit confusing, as there's two rooms that seem to be run by completely different hosts and servers, and no sign up list. They eventually sent us to the back room, where we waited for about 25 minutes before being seated. Whew! As with most (or let's be honest, all) dim sum places, the service is no frills. There's a polite hello and goodbye, but for the most part it's: fill out this card, enjoy your food and get the hell out so someone else can get your table. But hey, that's part of its charm, right?  The portions here are typical dim-sum size, with about 3-4 dumplings (or the equivalent) per order. Our group of three shared eight or so dishes, plus one regular sized dish off the menu, and we were super happy. Highlights were definitely the Sesame Balls, the Pan-Fried Pork Dumplings and by FAR the Snow Pea Leaves in Garlic Sauce. Those are a must-order! We'd also heard good things about the Fried Pumpkin Custard and the Milk Tarts, and they didn't disappoint.  Ways to succeed at Rol San: even if they're stuffed to the brim, the hosts will always tell you it'll be a 10-15 minute wait. Budget 30 or so, and you'll never be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The best dim sum I have ever had! As most people have said, they tend to go to Rol San after an evening of drinking. But how can you truly enjoy the meal when you'll probably just forget you even ate the next day?   I have been coming for lunch every other week for the past few months and absolutely love it! The food is fast, reliable, and delicious. The service is a hit or miss, but it really doesn't matter because I came for the food!"}
{"text":"Completely average. Staff is curt. Food is ok. There are actually a lot of tables in the back area, so at least you probably won't have to wait."}
{"text":"I came here as I was craving late night dim sum and this was the only place open at the time. The place was surprisingly pretty lively at 11:30. Food and service are both standard for a dim sum place. Food came out quickly. They had quite a large menu selection. Would come back again for more late night dim sum!"}
{"text":"While on a walk today we were craving dim sum and we stopped in a Rol San. The place is always really busy, and normally it is one of my favourite dim sum places, but today we watched the staff leaving half the tables empty while being really rude to some customers. While the food is still good it is hard to enjoy it when the staff is so rude. As dim sum places disappear from downtown I hope this is not a sign of things to come."}
{"text":"Yummmms for dim sum, yummmms for dinner. ALWAYS made fresh! THE BEST: Pumpkin cashew desert fried dumpling!!! Droooolz. Can't speak proper English until consumed and satisfied."}
{"text":"When this place opened up, dim sum in Toronto was mostly banquet halls with the red walls, gold dragon and phoenixes, and the carts! Here you sit and order. The dim sim is pretty decent here as well as the pricing. It is usually busy so expect to wait in line.  They have a room in the back where they may ask you to go sit. If you don't mind waiting, I would highly recommend waiting for a table in the front. Service in the back is worse and I don't like the atmosphere back there either. Otherwise, I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is good - some very weird textures here and there (chicken feet were overrated to me; it was just bone fragment and cartilage), but don't come here. As read in many others' reviews both on Yelp and elsewhere, we saw that the employees would try to charge you extra for food you never bought and hope you won't notice - and what do you know, our bill that should have been about $15 came to $19. Absolutely pitiful.   Do not give them your business."}
{"text":"Great dim sum. The shrimp hargow are awesome. Can be very busy around peak hours, so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I love you Rol San.  I can always depend on you to be open when I need some after-drinks late night eats.   You make my Cantonese chow-mein perfectly. Your crispy chicken is never dry. I can't get enough of your BBQ pork fried rice. Your pepper steak could be less peppery though. Your service is pretty quick but your waiters could smile a bit more, and thank you for not rolling your eyes at me because I'm the only Asian in the restaurant who wants a fork.   I've been coming here for years, and as long as they are open, I will be back for more. You can find me here anytime after 2am."}
{"text":"Ordered way too much. I missed the dim sum carts but the place was crowded. Tasty though."}
{"text":"If only there's a no star rating.. That's what I'll give them. Came here with a group of my friends last Thursday night cuz we're craving for some dimsum. I had a bad experience with them. So many drunk customers when we got there that we have to request to transfer to another table. Then when we we're about to pay, they over charged us with things we didn't get.. So make sure you double check your bill before leaving.. And to top it all, I lost my iPhone 4 here and when I asked the owner he said they don't have it. But my IPhone tracker is saying that it's with them. Not so good. Bad for the business. Gave me a bad impression with Toronto. But I know it's this place that's worse!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, was blown away by the actual size of the establishment (looks like an average size from outside but it is HUGE) It was fairly busy, but not uncomfortable. Try the shrimp dumplings, pork buns, ribs you cannot go wrong! I found service to be as expected for 1) a Chinese restaurant 2) in Chinatown absolutely no complaints there  I did find the bill to be heavier than expected but I quickly realized that they simply added the tip without mention. That was not appreciated and was my only let down to otherwise a great meal. I will be back. I strongly advise all to watch the bill and ensure there are no  indiscriminate charges"}
{"text":"Turnip cake, suckers. Turn up the stars! Four stars!   Don't turn up your nose to this classic plastic-table-clothed Chinatown dim sum joint. It delivers. From chicken feet, to sticky rice to buns to dumps and beyond, it delivers. (Metaphorically, I don't know if they actually have delivery service.)   This is my favourite cheap dim sum place in TO. There. I said it.   The a la carte menu items are less awesome, so it isn't quite a five star restaurant in my books, but it won't stop me from coming back and ordering dump trucks full of dumps after a night on the town.   Lastly. Really. Try the turnip cakes, they're shockingly delightful."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute delight and blows every single dim sum place in NYC out of the water. We ordered many of the same dishes that we would get in NYC-- spare ribs, pork buns, shrimp dumplings, etc. You name it, we probably ordered it here. The serving sizes make their NYC counterparts look like the kiddie versions, we're talking a full 1.5 times bigger for all of the buns as well as the spare ribs. It was comical seeing dim sum dishes not only bigger but about 20% cheaper (maybe even a bit more). We all know that the NYC chinatown is crap but man I just... this place just made me feel bad. I so wanted to somehow swap the two Chinatowns given how much better the Toronto Chinatown is than that of NYC's. I miss this place already and it's only been two weeks. Sigh."}
{"text":"Good dimsum. Good value. They let u linger long after eating.  Above average for cleanliness. Free green tea is also very soothing for a cold day!"}
{"text":"We came here for dim sum. No dim sum carts here but that's ok. The dim sum trays that came out were hot and delicious. We ordered the typical stuff - hagao, shiumai, taro puff, pork with black beans - all were excellent and not too greasy. Service was kinda slow. They also accepted US dollars."}
{"text":"Dim sum was ok, I've had much better but for the price, it's pretty decent.  Late night greasiness is where it's at."}
{"text":"The Dim Sum dishes were alright. I had the tripe, hargow and siu mai, the turnip cake, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf and chicken feet. I would say each dish is just average. It is nothing too spectacular where you would say WOW .   The turnip cake was not cooked throughout It was falling apart and raw on the inside."}
{"text":"I was buying drugs at the pharmacy across the street and asked the store owner for his take on dim sum.  Without hesitation they told me to go to the restaurant with a lobster sign.  Up and down Spadina I walked, and finally realized by lobster sign he meant lobster neon light in the window.  Who am I to blame though when I totally missed the giant \"WE SERVE DIM SUM\" sign.  Overall it was yummy to the tummy.  I ate solo and got shrimp har gow, tripe in ginger sauce, and chang fen with shrimp (rice rolls I believe they're called).  These three items cost me $15 with tip.  The service was efficient but did not rush me despite there being a constant line waiting to be seated.  When English failed, I used Mandarin.  When Mandarin failed, I pointed with my finger since my Cantonese is crap.  I sat at a communal table and got buddy buddy with two people sitting beside me.  Noticing I hadn't ordered dessert, they offered me a sesame ball.  In grand Chinese tradition, I did not disrespect their hospitality and swallowed that shit whole."}
{"text":"Not the best dim sum I've had but it is decent for Toronto. If you are heading here on a weekend be prepared for long line ups! (Go next door to Ding Dong Pasteries to grab some mini buns - 3 for $1 - to snack on during your 1 hour wait) The service is typical of any Chinatown restaurant - efficient but not always friendly. Food comes out piping hot and as it is made (you order by form and not by cart). They do have dim sum all day everyday, although the menu is more extensive on weekends. I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"Food ** Service ** Ambience *  I've gone to Roll San for years (only for 2 dishes....).  This place is disappointing because the food is poorly made, service is underwhelming and decor of the place out of the 1990s.    I've had dim sum at the spot and multiple later evening or late night dinners and other than the crispy Beef and deep fried squid, nothing is good.  (In full disclosure I am not a Dim Sum fan, but do enjoy and appreciate the good stuff... such as at Din Tai Fung in HK.). Suffice to say that I won't be returning.    PS.  If you are I'm the neighbourhood and want Chinese, go to Swatow just 100 meters south of ROL San, on the South side!"}
