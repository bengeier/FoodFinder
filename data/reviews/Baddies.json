{"text":"Although very tasty - paying almost $15 for a latte and a breakfast sandwich is ridiculous."}
{"text":"This place is ok. I want to like it. The people who run it seem nice. However, it's a little over priced and I don't understand why they close at 4pm and are not open on Sunday."}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time today just to grab a coffee. The barista was sullen and dismissive. Looks like I'll continue making the walk to The Common to get my coffee. The folks there are exceedingly more friendly!"}
{"text":"Before I begin, apologies for the rather long review, as well as a little background on me to put this review into context... 

I have been involved in the Hospitality industry for over 25 years now, and have opened more than 18 new locations (restaurants, bars, and even a nightclub) myself, or for corporations. I KNOW just about all the ins and outs of this wonderful, buzzing, and at times manic industry of ours (and no, I am in no way affiliated with Baddies, as friends, payment, or any other form), so please believe me when I say that this little place is totally worth the visit!!

We were here with my gf on a gorgeous Saturday afrenoon as I had looked online and wanted a place that was in the area and had some vegetarian options for her to choose from. Although there are other vegetarian places in the area, I opted for Baddies because I remember it when it was a pastry place before (great pastries, but really sucky decor and ambiance though. Thankfully Baddies has done a great job in transforming said decor and ambiance).

Walked in on a very busy afternoon with all the staff bustling about, and got the last open table. Shed our jackets, and the waitress managed to come over immediately and ask if it was our first time there (it was). She then got us menus and explained that we just order at the counter when we're ready, and then they'll bring it to us when the order is up.

Now from this point forward, everything just got better and better! Not only was everyone working here friendly, but the menu was compact and straightforward and everything sounded just wonderfully delicious! I went to the counter to order and pay, and took my seat. 

In the meantime the waitress had dropped off waters for us, and then came back with cutlery when the order was processed. We had a long black coffee with house-made almond milk, a and a Sitcky Chai tea arrive within 5 minutes of my order at the counter. The food then arrived not 15 minutes later (probably more like 12-13, and remember, it was a BUSY time), and the food looked AMAZING!!! We had ordered the Smashed Avocado on Prairie Boy sourdhough, and the Bondi Burger with the slow-cooked peri peri chicken for this musclehead, and it all tasted just as amazing as the presentation looked!

Our server promptly then came by to do a food check with us even though it was very busy (sometimes servers get so overwhelmed that it unfortunately falls in the cracks), and at one point another member of the team came over with an extra napkin as he had somehow noticed when my napkin had slid off my lap onto the floor, even though I hadn't (that level of attention to detail and care go a long way!). 

Lastly on the stop was the ubiquitous bathroom visit, and it was apparent that the management and staff also adhere to the adage of \"if you want to really see how clean a kitchen is, visit the bathroom\". Spotless, and even the liquid handsoap was a luxury brand and finished the experience on a fragrantly positive note.

Overall ratings (out of 5*):

Beverage: 5
Food: 5
Service: 5
Ambiance: 4 (even though great music, but just a tad loud for the middle of the afternoon and had to be in really close to be able to understand one another. Overall, really no big deal though)

GREAT JOB to the Baddies team!!!! Lets just hope that they manage to keep up this level of awesome Australian hospitality experience and afford more and more west end Torontonians the same wonderful surprise that we were afforded!

\"Good on ya mates\"! ;-)"}
{"text":"Visited Baddies for the second time today. The coffee is great, the food is gorgeous and equally delicious, and the atmosphere is bright and clean. We also had really excellent service - I'll be back, and often."}
{"text":"Stunning space serving breakfast and lunch offerings. Smash avocado, muesli, chia pudding, steak sammy, eggs to name a few. 

Came in only for an Americano- strong and piping hot just the way I like it.

Some things that caught my eye house made sticky chai tea and Belgian ganache hot chocolate. 

Will be back to try out the food and hot chocolate."}
{"text":"A hip cafe in Bloordale that'll quench your coffee crave with healthy meals for breakfast/lunch to go along with it. It's a pay first establishment and your given a number to place on your table.

The concept of the cafe is minimal in all aspects. There are a number of tables to sit at, small enough for twos but can easily be put together to seat more. If the tables are full, don't fret, there are bleachers at the back wall with crates stacked for table space. Large groups are hard to seat here, but if you are a bigger group the earlier you come the better the seating selection. 

If you've got kids, this cafe is very kid friendly, as well as baby friendly. There will be lots of space available for your stroller and the other cafe diners may even keep your babies attention so you can eat in peace (free babysitting - but maybe this was pure luck when I went...).

I ordered a latte, the pancakes and smashed avocado on toast. 

The latte was very good.  Deep roast and and great ratio of espresso and milk. 

The pancakes were moist and fluffy - a very filling dish. The sauce that comes over it is super green visually and flavourwise too. It's a great choice for kids, but I'd recommend getting the sauce on the side in case they are picky about the flavour of the sauce. My niece ate the edge around the pancake and avoided anything that touched the sauce. 

The toast was a favourite of mine. They load it with avocado! You can get the egg on the side, but I didn't add that option. To be honest, it's quite simple and can be made at home but it's tastes great here and is a nice treat to eat without the labour work."}
{"text":"I am a frequent user of Lansdowne station so I've always been passing this place in my travels. Today I finally got to see the caf√©'s atmosphere hiding behind their white blinds. The tiny amount of seating cheesed my partner, but I was really fascinated by their breakfast options which were fairly priced for quality and presentation. We scored the last table available and again, noticed as more customers came in, that if we had brought a larger group than the two of us we would have felt excluded for seating options. I ordered the Breaky roll which was a well- put-together breakfast sandwich from top to bottom. I got extra bacon on the side because I needed to experience its delicioisness in isolation. Also the filtered coffee had great flavour. No regrets in terms of food choices, but you're taking a gamble in getting a good spot for a breakfast/brunch date."}
{"text":"Small coffee shop with beautifully plated food, that is packed with fresh ingredients. The coffee is delicious. I had the cappuccino and the cactus juice (so refreshing)) to eat I had the frenchie which is topped with vanilla mascarpone and brown butter maple sauce. The brekki roll was incredible as well, the bacon covered in the blood brothers brewery bbq sauce was everything! I would also recommend the bircher muesli- it's so fresh and colorful. It filled me right up! 

This little shop is perfect for small intimate breakfast dates, meetings or just coming to read a good book with a damn good cup and yummy food!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, cool staff! 

Food is great ; brekkie roll will satisfy your brunch dreams ... avocado toast is also  

Will be back"}
{"text":"First meal of Toronto for a spring break trip! Honestly couldn't have asked for a better brunch to start this trip. We ordered the smashed avocado and the brekkie roll - both were amazing! The avocado toast looked like it had a whole avocado spread onto it, and the pomegranates were a nice addition to the spread. The brekkie roll was very flavorful and the bacon inside was so good with the barbecue sauce. We left satisfied, but not overbearingly full! Would recommend a small group because seating is limited. And the staff was very kind :)."}
{"text":"We visited Baddies on a Saturday afternoon. The location is right by the subway station and close to a green P. It's bright with big windows and about 10 tables for seating. It was busy at 1 pm and didn't quiet down, it was ongoing traffic through the doors. So it must be good!

You should know, the tables are not first come first serve but rather who gets to the table first. I almost got into it with a girl about that, which wasn't so bad except it's annoying to have to fight for a table. The waiter was nice about it and said they are still working out the seating.
So I'd suggest waiting by the door for a table cause at least anyone coming in after you will know you're ahead. Well, I hope...

We ordered the matcha latte and chai latter. Both were good. I expected a little more than the chai latte...
They were out of hotcakes so I ordered the chia pudding with avocado pudding and fruits. It was good, light and fresh. I felt full until dinner time, no snacking. So even though it was light it was quite filling. 
My husband got the avocado toast, with fried egg (the slow poached egg would've been 20 mins wait) and bacon on the side. He liked it. The sweet potatoes was a nice touch. The beets, he said would be better if it was chopped into small pieces. 

Overall it was good, apart from the seating situation and the chai latte. I would come back probably on a weekday to try the hotcake!"}
{"text":"My first time and I had such a lovely experience. The esthetic is so airy and relaxing which is a great start. We sat down and were offered menus and told to come to the cash to place our order. Decision was tough but I opted for the vegan and my friend got the avo toast. Our lattes were brought over in a timely manner and the wait wasn't too long for our meals. Once I saw them on their way over I was already drooling. The plating is perfect and the portions are large. I'm a quantity type of girl so I was more than pleased. I literally scraped my plate clean and finished my friends avo toast because it was so big she couldn't finish. I cannot wait to come back here and try more on the menu. 
Last but not least they had an awesome selection of hip hop playing in the background. Happy Monday!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmy! 

I had the lamb sandwich and a matcha latte - the latte could have been a bit stronger in my opinion but that might be personal preference. 

The sandwich was amazing; flavourful, tender, delicious. 

Staff was awesome and super friendly :)"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food back but it looked awesome. Can't wait to try the smashed avocado. Coffee was great! Had an Americano made with 49th Parallel Coffee. Loved the bleacher seating and overall vibe."}
{"text":"Everything about this little cafe was excellent. Being (another) Australian I was excited to visit for a taste of home and I was not disappointed.

The coffee was really excellent espresso style - strong and with the \"right\" milk ratio for an Aussie. The food is delicious, beautifully presented and really interesting. I had the avocado on toast which was full of seeds, citrus and other unexpected flavours which all worked perfectly together. The poached egg was perfectly cooked. My partner had the brekky roll and raved about it.

The fit out is really cute but the cafe is certainly small, so time your visit well- we went on a weekday morning and it was pretty quiet. The staff are really lovely and prices are very reasonable. 

Totally recommend this lovely place!"}
{"text":"Wow I just had the best French-toast I've ever had. Great little Australian style cafe. Coffee to go and a awesome menu for a visit with a good friend or a few. Definitely will come back. Open one of these in London please"}
{"text":"This is a great place to have brunch on a weekend with a couple of your friends. The tables are super cute. The interior design has hipster written all over it. The bench/bleachers that you can sit at at the back of the cafe (OH I LOVE IT ALL).

I came here with my friend one weekend (I don't believe they take reservations, but double check) and there was no line up for a table (yay!). We were seated right away. Both of us ordered a cappuccino to start (you go up to the cashier to order). I loved the barista who made our drinks. He was so sweet - in fact, everyone here was wonderful. He said it was the best cappuccino design he had made (definitely instagram worthy). Not surprisingly, all their items are instagram worthy. We ordered the avocado and toast as well as the beautiful pancakes. The presentation was A+ but so was the taste! 

I would definitely come back here! You've got to try it out."}
{"text":"I only need to say two words:

Brekkie Roll

I don't know what's on this thing but it's a taste of heaven. You flip it upside down and the egg yoke soaks into the bun. The staff is great, the look is great, the music is great. You can see right into the kitchen which I like, always gives me a feeling the chef is confident. One thing I will say is that it's really popular, so if you're going with a group bigger than 2, might be a wait. Somehow with 2 people they've always fit me in. They also have this great bleacher seating if you want to just post up there. Enough reading, go get the Brekkie Roll! Oh yeah, their coffee is also the best in the city."}
{"text":"It's really hard for me to decide what to rate this place because one thing was AMAZING and the others were horrible.  

The avocado toast (heirloom beet labneh, seasonal greens, sunflower seed, pickled beet, roasted persimmons, Prairie Boy sourdough) here is simply gorgeous!¬†¬† I added an egg on top for good measure but I think next time I might opt not to because the whites were way too soft for my liking.¬† I am not sure what exactly they mix into the avocado, but the seasoning is actually PERFECTION.¬† The bread was slightlyy on the hard side, but I don't even care, still the best brunch avocado toast I have ever had! (huge statement, I know).

The chia pudding is gorgeous as well, but sad to say that it looks much better than it tastes.  Lacks flavour and sweetness.  100% would not get this again.  

The pancake was also looking much better than it tasted.  It looked like a work of art, but the pancake itself was super dry and a bit crumbly.  Without all the fancy decorations, the pancake was actually horrible and I can make a better one at home with aunt jemima mix.  

So if you come, just make sure you eat the avocado toast and avoid the other two items.  I would definitely come again for the toast!"}
{"text":"Amazing avotoast + french toast, as well as lattes. A bit noisy and small so it was hard to keep a conversation going with my friend that I hadn't seen in a few months. Would definitely come again (perhaps earlier for breakfast). Such a cute little gem right outside Lansdowne Station!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, I love finding hidden gems close to home. I was so excited to try it and after a failed attempt to go there for brunch on a Sunday (FYI, they're closed on Sundays), I planned a lunch meeting here on a Tuesday.

They were busy when we arrived, so we waited patiently in the bleacher area for the 15 mins that the hostess said it would be for a table. About 25 minutes later, someone came by to tell us a table was almost ready. When we went up to the cash to order, they were out of the best sounding things on the small menu. When I ordered the avocado sandwich with a poached egg, they said they were out of poached eggs but could do an over easy one (not sure how that makes sense).

We also asked for a jug of water for our table, which the server didn't bring until my lunch date went up to ask for it again because she was parched.

The food was good and very fresh, although the crust on my bread was very hard (I think from overtoasting) and impossible to cut and even worse to chew."}
{"text":"I'm so blown away by this incredible brunch spot. Their French toast are, by far, the absolute best brekky item I've ever tasted. They make everything in-house, and my GOD it's stunning with the edible flowers. The lamb Sammie and the chia pudding with poached pear flowers are incredible."}
{"text":"Cute hidden spot right beside Landsdowne subway. I went for brunch with some girlfriends.  You stand up to order and they bring the food to your table.  There is minimal seating inside so I imagine it must get busy during peak brunch hours (we sat down at 10am on a Saturday).  Three of the four of us got the avocado toast with a poached egg, which was delicious.  I tried to vegan oat milk in a latte.  Very unique concept but they need to be able to seat more people."}
{"text":"It's like your one friend who tries so hard to be cool when they're already good."}
{"text":"Instagram worthy food with locally sourced, unique ingredients.

Instagram was the key driver for us picking Baddies for our Saturday brunch destination. While I arrived at 10:50am without a line, by 11am there were about 3 parties waiting to get seated. Because of the lineup, I was asked to give up my table since my friend did not arrive within a 10 minute window. Lesson learned - make sure your entire party is here before getting seated, or risk a few stressful minutes with the stares from the servers and other impatient customers in line!

Food wise, I had the Frenchie and a latte, while my friend had the Smashed Avocado toast and a cortado. Both of us agreed that the coffee here was amazing. The Frenchie was, as expected, quite an art piece. I particularly enjoyed the mascarpone, which was cinnamon-y and super delicious. I wish they stacked on a bit more! Also, be warned that it is one piece of toast, so you may want to order something on the side for a filling meal. My friend did not enjoy her avocado toast, which was a shame."}
{"text":"I'm trying to like this place, but I've been left disappointed each time I've eaten here. Prices are high, food *looks* great, but I continually leave feeling meh. Coffee is on point though. Perfect flat whites."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discovered this place on TOblog and Instagram. We are both from out of town and wanted to find a brunch place to eat. 

This place was designed as a small cute little coffee/brunch shop. It was a chill atmosphere vibe. As we arrived, we did not know we can just go to a table cause you usually wait till a host seats you. We just picked a table and you have to order your food up front. 

We ordered avocado toast, hot cake, and latte! Presentation was beautiful and it tasted great! I would love to go back :)"}
{"text":"Loveeeeeeee this place. If you are looking for good tasty food but also Instagram worthy food then definitely come here. The hotcake is delicious with fresh fruits, chocolate lavender bark and edible flowers on top. It's a def must! I'm usually not into chia pudding ...but this place makes it taste so yummy. Very cute place to hangout and grab brunch."}
{"text":"Lovely decor and great vibe. Great coffees and steak sandwich. Only complain is that the kitchen is open and the place did smell pretty greasy"}
{"text":"So I first found out about this place through two spots: blogTO and Instagram - two avenues that showcased some very \"pretty\" looking food. And overall, I'd say there's substance to those looks! Located at the northeast corner of Bloor Street and Landsdowne Avenue, we visited on a Saturday morning around 9:30 AM - to sum up the environment, this is a super hip caf√© with very clean, modern, minimalistic d√©cor, but it's still very relaxing and cozy! Very bright, lots of natural light. A great way to start your morning. 

We ordered a Latte ($3.75), a Belgian Ganache Hot Chocolate ($3.75), Brekkie Roll ($8.50 - breakfast sandwich with smoked bacon, egg, chimmichurri, tomato relish, and various sauces), and the Hotcake ($10.00 - vanilla bean pancake with matcha caramel and raw cacao butter). Overall, pretty good. The Brekkie Roll wasn't the best breakfast sandwich we've had, but it did the job, and was a nice take to a basic breakfast sandwich. The Hotcake was beautifully presented (check out those edible flowers!), and overall, while it didn't have very bold flavours, it was nice and light. 

The food was a bit pricey, but we'd come back! Good for couples, small groups, and families!"}
{"text":"We have frequent this coffee shop on the far west quite a few times now. Needless to say, this place is extremely instagram-worthy. However, the line does get a little too much at times.  

I have always rooted for this little coffee shop out west. It is one of the fewer places in town that served Aussie brekkies.  Their food is also very well-known to be very beautifully-plated. I have been a sucker myself for taking at least a good 15 minute each time to photograph every dish. The food usually also tastes as good as it looks. 

Recently, however, we did find that the lamb sammi was not as good as it was before. The lamb was a tad too over cooked and chewy, and the egg was made overhard. Without the runny yolk, the sandwich was a bit dry. And we were not able to get that eggporn shot either. The french toast and the avotoasts were both still made beautifully, and still tasted decently good.

Baddies has a small menu, and you can usually get through the whole menu within two to three visits.  Despite the Ig-worthy dishes, here's a question I have - is the taste of the food, the location, and the service good enough for us to keep returning and wait in line for two hours every time we go? 

The pros are you get amazing pictures out of that morning. The food is usually consistent. 

The cons are you can almost never get seated ever unless you wait for 1-2 hours on weekends. It closes at 4PM Monday to Saturday, and it's closed on Sundays. It is located quite far, and it's a trek if you don't drive. The tables for 4 are TINY, and it definitely is not a comfortable dining experience for a party of 4 or more. 

If you can get past all the cons, then sure, Baddies would be the place to be!"}
{"text":"This place is great for one thing and one thing only; hipster instagram pictures. Other than that, the food is pretty gross. I ordered the Chia Pudding (tasted really gross), the hot cake (which was just a jumble of pretty bland things), and lastly, their Belgian spiced hot chocolate.I was hoping the spiced hot chocolate would taste somewhat like Sonoma Chocolatier's Mayan spiced hot chocolate. How wrong I was. This tatsted like watered down hot chocolate with zero spice nor kick.

Do yourself a favor and don't come here."}
{"text":"I think it was the Instagram-worthy pancakes that drew me in to this Aussie-inspired brunch locale in Bloordale and I'm thankful that they did.

The interior is simple and small, filled with lots of light and decked out in white metal stools, dark wood tables, bleachers and Bondi beach inspired wallpaper for that oh so cool vibe.

You can brunch at Baddies Monday-Saturday from 8am-4pm, their menu offers tasty noshes like brekky rolls, muesli and the ever popular and oh so beautiful buttermilk hot cake. Espresso drinks can be imbibed hot or cold, they make their very own sticky chai tea, serve 49th Parallel teas, hot cocoa and house made juices to suit every discerning taste.

I wanted to try the pancake, I really did, but I'm a savoury gal, and the Brekky Roll with Cumbraes double smoked bacon, sunny side up egg, chimmichurri, tomato relish, Blood Brothers IPA BBQ sauce and the addition of avocado had my name on it, plus the girl behind the counter said it was the best in her cool Aussie accent.

The roll, which held all the goodness of this brekky sandwich together was light, yet had the perfect amount of chewiness and crumb. I asked the guy behind the counter if they made it themselves and he replied in his cool Aussie accent, that they are made by Prairie Boy Bread, which I made a mental note to go and check out.

I came during the latter half of the day, around 3pm, so I didn't give any of the coffee drinks a try. Believe me, if I were there in the morning I'd definitely be all over the caffeine, but I was hot from walking and shopping the streets of Bloordale, and opted for a refreshing lychee and cactus pear juice. Hot pink and fruity, it was the perfect refreshment to cool me off.
l
I'll definitely be back, the vibe was welcoming, the food was delish, the staff was friendly and who am I kidding, those Aussie accents will get ya every time!"}
{"text":"*BADDIES IS CLOSED ON SUNDAYS*

Okay, now that that's out of the way, allow me to fawn over this Aussie brekkie joint. OMG the food is so yummy and pretty! When I first walked past this cafe I was like *HOLD UP* because it's very slick looking and after 2 years of mastering brunch in Sydney, Australia, I know a good cafe when I see one. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this place is, in fact, inspired by the unholy kangaroo land itself.

I don't know if you know this, but brunch is an art form in Australia. Straight up. It's art. Just come here and find out what I mean. The presentation of food is taken very seriously and the food is damn good. Smashed avo is a staple food in Australia. It's probably considered a daily vitamin or on their balanced diet charts somewhere. Expect to be taken on a wild ride through avocado land.

Seriously just go."}
{"text":"Great third wave coffee at Bloor and Lansdowne, the second third wave joint in the neighbourhood after Propeller. They use 49th Parallel beans and steam their milk to an appropriate temperature, something I've found elusive in Toronto lattes. In my books, along with Propeller, this is the best coffee east of Roncesvalles (Reunion Island), north of Dundas (Tucana), west of Christie (Sam James), and south of Geary (Dark Horse).

What keeps Baddies short of five stars is the kitchen odours that have permeated the space every time we have walked in. So far we have gotten our to-go coffee from Baddies and stuck with Propeller for sit-down caffeination in the area."}
{"text":"This recently opened cafe is a rare find that combines great coffee and beautiful and tasty food options for breakfast/lunch in a sweet, modern space. I got the avocado toast which was super satisfying and brilliant paired with beet puree for a perfect contrast in flavours. 

The kitchen closes at 3pm, so this is for those of you who work non-traditional hours or are taking a staycation, because it is a quiet, weekday chill kinda place. They are open on weekends, but I'd guess it gets full pretty quickly since there aren't many tables. 

Leave your work and laptop at home! There is no wifi on purpose -- this is much more of a social kinda cafe. Location is super TTC friendly - right outside the entrance of Lansdowne station."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast with a friend this morning. It's a very small shop, the setup isn't super clear but you go to order at the counter and if there isn't a table available you can wait for one while sitting on the bleachers at one end of the room. You're given a number so the server knows to which table to deliver your food. The hostess/server was friendly and polite. The space is nice but it was crowded and the music was very loud. 

As for the food/drink it was a mixed bag - Had the smashed avocado toast (very average, not a lot of flavour - better when I added salt and pepper), americano (excellent), and an almond-strawberry muffin (excellent, very moist, unique). I added a poached egg to the avo toast which was underdone - definitely crossed my mind as to whether it was safe to eat or not (fingers crossed it was the pasteurized variety). Once seated at our table we were served small glasses of water but unfortunately they weren't refilled. 

If I'm in the neighbourhood again I wouldn't hesitate to stop by and get a coffee and muffin to go - but certainly won't bother coming back for a whole meal, and in fact would probably avoid going back with a friend as the background volume made it hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"The brekkie roll and avocado toast taste really good. It's filling but not too rich/heavy. I actually felt energized after instead of tired/food coma. I would definitely go back here again. They also have really cool juices, the ones in the picture I had were fresh lychee cactus pear juice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Got the smashed avocado with porched egg and the flat white. I just love the vibe in the coffee shop. Nice and friendly barista as well."}
{"text":"It's pretty. It's tasty. Easy on your wallet. Smashed avocado, the \"frenchie\" (out of this world!). Yum. Wow!"}
{"text":"My chance encounter with Baddies was on a weekday mid morning. Very comfortable and great time to chill. I ordered the Frenchie, it had many layers of experience. I think I heard the compote rotates, so yours might be a bit different depending on the day. I did come by on Saturday and it's super popular, you can get it to go but if you want a relaxing time, try a weekday."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best places in the neighbourhood for coffee. Dropped by on Thanksgiving holiday and it wasn't too packed (usually there's a bit of a wait). I would recommend the large pancake. Normally I don't like pancakes but this was one amazing."}
{"text":"My new favourite brunch place in Toronto. Visited with a friend last week. I ordered the lamb sandwich and their matcha latte made with house made almond milk. She order the brekkie and a latte. Everything we ordered was delicious. And their house made almond milk was perfect with the matcha. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a coffee on a Saturday morning. The staff was lovely and offered info on the coffee being brewed. I had a  drip and my boyfriend has an americano. They were both good. The space is really nice, cozy but functional. They serve brunch and have regular coffee shop staples, and a few unique things as well. Definitely is going to be a popular place, as it's in a perfect location and the coffee is worth returning for !"}
{"text":"Pretentious as ever. Food is just as bad as the crappy service. If there was an option for no stars I would select. Limited, and expensive menu. They are so pretentious that they won't scramble an egg for you, even when you ask nicely. Nothing on menu but sunny side up eggs, no options for scrambled....even upon request!  They refuse. Any 12 or 14 dollar sandwich should have an effing option of not eating goey egg yolk if you aren't into it, right?  Sitting area sucks with crappy uncomfortable bench's every where. Baddies is bad as in bad not bad as in good. If there was one good thing to say is that it's good we won't be back."}
{"text":"There was nothing bad about this brunch! I finally tried Baddies after wanting to go for ages! (I always forget that they are closed on Sundays).

If you've ever been to Australia, you will adore this place. It brought me back to some of my favourite cafes and restaurants in Aus - great food, laid back vibe and aesthetically beautiful. 

I ordered the \"not smashed avocado\" - which was a brilliant combination of cauliflower, leeks, adzuki beans, coconut pur√©e and a side of avocado. 

The presentation was beautiful and even more delicious! I also ordered a matcha latte that was great. 

The customer service is truly top notch at this establishment. They were busy and forgot my latte and after gently reminding them about it, they brought it out to me with a card for a free drink. This was a really kind and appreciated gesture. 

I can't wait to come back for brunch again soon!"}
{"text":"After months of trying to get here, I finally found the time, and wow was it worth it! The food here is delicious. The presentation of the food is a whole other story, it is incredibly intricate with however they garnish it, whether its edible flowers, icing sugar, or syrups. It can get pretty busy but it is definitely worth trying if you're ever in Toronto, the prices are fair. I would recommend coming here for breakfast or brunch! Overall a lovely environment"}
{"text":"Reminds me very much about being in Australia especially when the hot pancakes was served. 
Cool vibes, great healthy food options in their menu.  The coffee awakens your senses...hmm. love the bitter taste in my usual flat white coffee."}
{"text":"Love that this place is situated close to a subway and fairly close to home.  Almost perfect to what a Flat White can be is found here!  A complete Aussie experience wouldn't be without Avo toast--smashed avocado on toast!  

Short a star for their limited hours closing at 5pm making it difficult for the most of us who would like our evening flat white here a possibility.

It's worth checking out :)"}
{"text":"First time trying baddies! Had their bondie burger and it was awesome! I'd definitely go back again. Space is cozy so not too many tables but it's neat they have bleacher style single seating for people just there to have a coffee and chill a bit!"}
{"text":"Lovely lovely atmosphere! I went in on a weekday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. I got the mint tea and my friends got a matcha tea and an espresso, all of which were very delicious. I'm hesitant about trying the food because I often find \"trendy\" dishes at coffee shops to be disappointing, but the people next to us seemed to be really enjoying their meal! I will definitely go back to try! x"}
{"text":"I don't usually venture past walking distance when it comes to a lazy weekend brunch, but I had to come here. This place is so cute and perfectly instagrammable! We ordered a bit of everything: matcha latte, breakfast burger, side of bacon, and their famous pancake. Portions were small, but prices weren't bad."}
{"text":"OVERVIEW: An overdue revisit to Baddies back a few months ago! It's become one of my go to places for brunch. This time I tried two different dishes and they both tasted as amazing as they look 

DISHES: The first dish is their Hot Cakes which are butter milk pancakes topped with seasonal curds and chocolate lavender bark. As you all know, I don't love dessert as other people due cause I don't have a sweet tooth, unless it's ice cream BUT honestly these hotcakes are amazing!! The pancakes were super light and airy and the seasonal curds and fruits contrasted well with the chocolate lavender bark. 10/10 I would order it again when they have it back on their menu!! 

The 2nd dish is their Brekkie Roll which includes Cumbraes double smoked bacon, sunny egg, chimichurri, tomato relish, blood brothers brewery BBQ sauce. Yummmm!! 

SUMMARY: Surprisingly, out of the two dishes I enjoyed the hot cakes more because it was a unique take on pancakes with very natural flavours. After visiting two times now, I really got to say that you can't go wrong with anything that you order from Baddies because they really put a lot of heart in every dish they put out! Stay tuned for future visits because I'm sure there will be plenty more."}
{"text":"Baddies is a hip new coffee shop right by Lansdowne subway station opened by an Aussie. Bringing the Aussie coffee/brunch culture to Toronto, this cafe does not have any wifi. They encourage you to make new friends, relax, and enjoy what they have to offer. The interior is bright, minimal, and has a relaxed vibe to it. You can opt to sit at one of the tables or if you're feeling up for it, you can sit on the bleachers to the side of the cafe. 

I came by Baddies on a Wednesday morning on my day off thinking that the cafe would be quiet. However, I was wrong. I ordered an Americano and an avocado toast at the counter and managed to grab a table even though the place was busy. A number is given to you when you pay at the counter and the food is served to you once it is ready. Service was definitely friendly and attentive. My Americano arrived first and it was piping hot just how I like it. Im a fan of 49th Parallel Coffee Roasters so I drank my Americano black. My avocado toast came shortly after and the presentation was definitely on point. The beet puree that was served with the avocado toast made the whole dish pop with colour. The toast included avocado, tomato, sunflower seeds, and microgreens. All the components elevated the dish. Warning...this is definitely not just any avocado toast!

Definitely will come back for more! Delicious brunch and coffee."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch place. 

+ I've seen a lot of their pictures online - the food and the decor is indeed instagram worthy. 

+ I ordered the bircher muesli (the larger size). The dish looks super appetizing and healthy, and it looks quite deceiving because it is VERY FILLING. I was just able to finish the large size but I could have been satisfied with the regular size. I actually really enjoyed the fresh fruit and the muesli combination together. Would definitely order this again!

+ I also tried the brekkie roll - very tasty

+ The hotcakes tend to sell out quickly so come early if you want to get some

+ There is not a lot of table space and room inside so come during non peak times 

+ Tables don't look like they can occupy a party of more than 6 people 

+ Walls and decor are very clean and aesthetically pleasing - instagram worthy so take those pics!"}
