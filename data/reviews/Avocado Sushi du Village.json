{"text":"Sushi is OK, nothing to rave about. Better than the all you can eat places but not quite at level of a Maiko, Park Place or the old Koji Kaizen in terms of food quality, creativity, service and ambience. Note to Avocado sushi chefs: sushi rice should not be cold or hard! I wonder if some of the more common pieces were made in advance. The place is very small and cramped. The wait staff is friendly but it's clear they are not experienced pros. Maybe I expect too much from the wait staff. When you don't order wine, please remove the 4 wine glasses from an already cramped table. Also, keep an eye on the table so you can remove serving dishes as they are used. I had to ask them multiple times. What's with the plastified menus and magic markers? Paper too expensive? Overall, I thought that the experience was underwhelming giving how many great reviews it had. I probably won't go back for dinner (maybe a quick lunch) as there are better, nicer sushi restaurants in west island for about the same price."}
{"text":"This is the best new addition to the West Island restaurant scene. The sushi is a blend of the familiar sushi nigiri or sashimi with wonderfully innovative tartars and rolls. In either case it's delicious, attractive - and very importantly for sushi - served at the perfect temperature!  Make sure you try the butterfish - I have never come across it before but it's my new favourite. Salads are also attractive and delicious. Everything is made as you order and there is a very nice counter where you can eat comfortably while watching it all come together. Tuna carpaccio is brilliant. Our last time we asked the chef to  make her own selections for us - result was a truly splendid dinner with just the right quantities and lots of new things to try. The restaurant itself is warm and cozy and the service is well timed, friendly and attentive. Hurray for excellent sushi in the West Island - finally!!"}
{"text":"New restaurant in Pointe Claire Village opened fall of 2012. Heard that the sushi was very good and in fact it was! Made on the spot at time of ordering. Many varieties which are more than enough to satisfy anyone's pallet Have two Japanese beers available which is fine. Maybe a bit more selection in wines. All rather fruity or sweet but one may like this with sushi ?   Service excellent and you can tell they are trying really hard to deliver a good product and service. We will frequent Avocado again and hope others will as well. Need to have some choices in the Village. 4 out of 5 !"}
{"text":"UPDATE.... Guess what? Still great! Chef was there as always and she made sure we were taken care of and the combinations of fruit and fish were paired to perfection. As always a perfect choice :)"}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere located is a small house next to the shore the food is very tasty I would recommend if you are in the west island ,the rolls are very funky .you should go to the ice cream place wild willy around the corner for dessert"}
{"text":"100% my go-to sushi shop in the West Island. This place is amazing to go with a few friends or on a date, as the atmosphere is extremely cute and relaxing. I refuse to go back to some sushi places in the area since the service here is great (might not always be the fastest but they care about their clients) and the quality of food is worth every penny. Don't hesitate to try this wonderful place out!"}
{"text":"Amazing lunch specials! The sushi for 2 and the Avocado Bowl are both very high quality and perfectly crafted. I remember taking a bite and thinking \"wow this is the best sushi I've ever had\". The outside terrace is quaint but I love the small feel. I think it's the cutest sushi restaurant in the West Island by far!"}
{"text":"J'y ai rejoint des amies qui connaissaient déjà bien le lieu et avaient deja des favoris. Alors qu'elles étaient prêtes à commander leurs sushis et tartares habituels, quelqu'un a suggéré que l'on partage ce qu'on allait commander, tapas-style! Quelle bonne idée! Nous avons ainsi gouté à plein de trucs sur le menu, et mes amies ont aussi pu tester de nouvelles choses, revoyant leur champ de 'favoris '. Des tartares originaux, des sushis bien sur mais pas des makis ou rouleaux traditionnels, des mélanges osés et très beaux dans l'assiette. Nous nous sommes régalées. Mon tartare préféré a été le 'house' tartare appelé avocado.  Le lieu est petit, il fait réserver. Bel endroit pour un groupe de copines. Pas un lieu pour les enfants a mon avis."}
{"text":"I love this Japanese restaurant. Every bite you take is so delicious. Fresh and interesting choices of sushi and other foods.   We highly recommend avocado!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident while walking in my favourite village PointeClaire in quebec and found  a jewel. Great ambiance clean and very good food excellent atmosphere sushi clean fresh and good service with friendly people. Good price for the quality you get"}
{"text":"Delicious food, with unique menu and drinks. Avocado inspired creations! Me and my family enjoy going to this restaurant because of the atmosphere and it's food."}
{"text":"A little gem of the west island! A cute little restaurant with a la carte sushi and other dishes, I'm surprised this place isn't more popular. The food is tasty, much better than all those all-you-can-eat. Definitely a place to go if you're a small party of 2-4. The setting is very simple and charming, and the service is on point.  Definitely recommend the Avocado tartare (not actually avocado, see picture). There is a variety of tartares in there, with a hint of crunches (rice crispies?), but it's definitely filling and very well worth the 17$  The Asian twist is full of flavor, but a little confusing as it emcompasses salty and sweet at the same time, in the same bite. Texture is complex as it is crunchy yet soft in some other areas. The maple syrup adds a little sweetness after taste. All in all, that dish in particular is a mouthful, but i wouldn't discourage from trying.  We also had the Sashimi straight up. Very well made, although not totally impressed with the octopus. Maquerel isn't my favourite, it's a very salty fish, but the butterfish was delicious!  Would definitely highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so cute!! We came here on a Friday night at 6:30 pm because we were in the neighborhood for an event and our colleague recommended it.   I started with a cucumber martini which was strong but I didn't quite like it though so I switched to white wine afterwards.  We shared the Japanese salad which is just a regular lettuce salad with dressing that tastes like sesame. It reminds me of the Kraft Asian Sesame dressing that I bought at Metro. I think perhaps I should have tried the seafood one instead. I tried the Japanese salad because tons of people here on yelp were recommending it.   Next we had the avocado tartare which is made with spicy scallop and salmon, wasabi lobster, tempura and sweet sauce. It was good and reminded me of the xmas tree sushi that they have at Saint sushi but in a martini glass. I prefer the xmas tree though. Also I didn't feel like it was sweet at all which is a good thing. This was my boyfriend's favorite of the night.   My boyfriend  thought the makis were nothing special but I enjoyed both. We ordered the  Barenaked sushi roll (spicy lobster and scallops rollup in salmon sashimi and rice paper) and the Maki St Laurent (spicy salmon, rice, blueberry, teriyaki sauce rolled in rice paper).   One downer was that I had asked for spicy mayo when we got our sushi but I got tired of waiting and just ate. The time we finally got it we were done our sushi.  It's far to go for sushi but if you are in the area I recommend it."}
