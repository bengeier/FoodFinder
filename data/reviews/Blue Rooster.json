{"text":"Good food.  Good service. Nothing to complain about.   I had the spanish eggs benedict. Very creative.  Great for breakfast."}
{"text":"I love this place, I go so often that they already know what I want when I sit down. I can tell they throw a bit extra on my plate, because they're amazing! The staff is great, the owner is very nice. And I keep coming back for more. I usually once during the weekend. The prices are great too!! and the coffee is great!"}
{"text":"Just tried the Philly Steak sandwich. HUGE (had to be bigger than 1 lb) and delicious. Highly recommended, especially if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my breakfast here. Nothing fancy on the menu, great service and cozy atmosphere. Very impressed with the coffee."}
{"text":"Large portions, good priced breakfast.  They do lunch too. Elvis eggs benedict: eggs Benny with bbq pulled pork. Your choice of home fries /hashbrowns, grilled, deep fried or shredded hashbrowns!"}
{"text":"Came to check this place out because I was recommended by a friend. I was not disappointed. Came with my wife and son who needed a highchair and they had a highchair. Bacon is excellent cook very well I think it's deep-fried. My wife liked it also. The staff was very friendly and really seemed pleasant. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Good food and good service! It wasn't too busy even on a Sat morning. I had the Italian omelette made with egg whites, it was very very good!!"}
{"text":"Very very good, top notch breakfast, we enjoyed everything, ask for crispy bacon and get crispy bacon. Light fluffy pancakes I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Nothing to scream about. They can't beat Angelique's breakfast. It is very clean though. Just went to give it a try. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today after reading all the positive reviews. The service was painfully slow and I had to ask for whip cream twice for my pancakes. The breakfast was okay at best... Pancakes were extremely dense and had barely and chocolate chips in them. The rest of my party got a egg and bacon meal and they also said it was okay. Waitresses were more concerned with eating their own breakfasts behind the counter than their customers. I'll stick Michaels eatery on station street the next time I want breakfast."}
{"text":"My local breakfast place since I've moved to Ajax. Donna and Nivia are great and full of spunk.  The atmosphere is good. It can get busy on the weekends but you will get a seat.  Breakfast is straight forward and done properly. Healthy servings at a good price.  Did I mention I like the servers !?"}
{"text":"This place is like 10 minutes from me and I think I've found my new go-to brunch place! My friend loved her mimosa and I had the eggs benedict and it was sooo good. Yum! Prices are average. I can't wait to go back and try the other stuff :)"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. If you have a big appetite you won't be disappointed. Very friendly staff. Place is small so a bit crowded."}
{"text":"We usually commute from North York to this nice brunch place. I took my brother and his girl here before and they asked to come back again. So we arranged today, I usually order the Egg Benny with smoked salmon $12.75 and add avocado ($1.95) They give you three egg benny and the home fries are nicely done. You can specify how you would like your eggs cooked. The service is very friendly and they will keep asking you if you need refills."}
{"text":"This restaurant has recently rebranded itself with renovations and has the same owners. I'm unable to comment on the changes as I never visited before the reopening.   What I can say is the restaurant is well decorated and the furniture is new and clean. I like that there is a large window looking into the kitchen which is also very clean.   I compare breakfast restaurants by their midweek special. Everyone has their favorite easy to cook the eggs, style of potatoe and method to cook bacon. Here they serve homefries that are large cut and very thin sliced bacon (both deep fried). My wife likes her bacon crispy but I prefer a little softness which is impossible deep fried. I enjoy a crispy outside of my potatoes which were cooked well. My over easy eggs were cooked great with yolks still soft.   I'm rating 3 stars because it's just an average good breakfast. Price,  portion and quality are all average.   I encourage everyone (including the owners) to eat around the corner to compare to their competition.  For $1 more the hash brown potatoes are grilled with a large portion,  bacon is thick sliced and a great smoke flavor.   But as I said, breakfast is a definite individual preference."}
{"text":"This place was a'ight. It being cuter than your standard greasy spoon diner, I expected a bit more character in the food, but overall it was just okay. I ordered a veggie omelette with a side of sausages...it came with toast and potatoes of my choosing (I chose shredded). The portion was enormous! Seriously, was that a 9-egg omelette? Also, I was served enough shredded potato for an army. Overall, it was tasty enough, but I found the omelette to be a bit dry, the sausages too greasy, and the potatoes a bit cold and lackluster (not crispy at all, which I was hoping for).  Hubby's chicken wrap had too much dressing for his taste, but otherwise he enjoyed it. Although, his fries were a bit below average.  Sorry for the harsh review! Just keeping it real. On a more positive note, the service was excellent. And they seemed to have a lot of regulars. So definitely give this place a chance and decide for yourself :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nice and clean on the inside! The owner was very nice also. The service was fast! I ordered the \"Elvis eggs Benedict with pulled pork\" it was yummy ... the eggs were runny  and everything tasted good. The owner is very sweet and talks to her customers, also she has some very nice regulars!!"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast joint in Durham Region. Two words...breakfast poutine.   They offer gluten free options as well (sadly, not the breakfast poutine, yet). The eggs benny is soooo good, especially on the hash. The service here is beyond great. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"The service here was fantastic! The shredded hash browns here were really good and it came with a little side of baked beans that were phenomenal. And it was really easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"We've had great friendly experiences coming here.  The food is good... a little overpriced but that's ok.  It doesn't break the bank.   They make their bacon exactly the way I like it"}
{"text":"$4.25 for two eggs, home fries, four of slices of bacon, and some nice rye toast. The eggs were a tad overcooked for my liking, but other than that, everything was good especially for that price. Our server was very nice and our coffee was refilled often. I would deffo return here."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we decided to come here for breakfast and give it a try. Daughter didn't like the breakfast that was offered at the hotel we were staying at. Hubs ordered the Spinach and cheese crepes. He asked the waitress what kind of cheese was in the crepes and the kitchen told her it was Swiss. It wasn't Swiss, it was cheddar. Hubs wasn't impressed with the crepes because he didn't think it tasted like crepes, but it's good to try new things. He thought it tasted like gluten free and mochi-like texture. He thought it was ok but wouldn't order it again. Daughter ordered the Eggs Florentine Benny with Deep fried fries. The fries were nice and crispy. It was best order of our 3. She got 4 poached eggs instead of 3 and she liked it a lot. Finally, I ordered Belgian Waffle with Whipped Cream and Nutella . The Nutella was drizzled on top of the waffle. I liked it a lot. Can't go wrong with waffles and Nutella and whipped cream! Service was friendly and not rushed. Restaurant is in a strip mall so there was plenty of parking. Will definitely return to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"The staff is great, however the food is terrible.  I've been 2 times and both times something wasn't cooked properly one time the milk was gone bad."}
