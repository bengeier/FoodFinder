{"text":"Have been visit to this izakaya restaurant for couple of times, food quality has been kept in a good constant level. The most important is 'freshness' for izakaya restaurant.... they have never disappointed me. Pork bone soup not as salty as those in downtown \"well known\" one......only food items are not too much.... but I think, if their business is getting more.... items will definitely be added. I think they are the best izakaya among Scarborough. Also they do have variety of sake items can be chosen. Good food taste fresh and great. Worth to visit.Highly highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Sorry, just noticed I didn't post this.  I've been here several times since then.

Just opened 3 weeks ago.  Perfectly cooked ramen. Miso broth was great. Not the biggest bowl but just enough to satisfy. Not set up for interac and the owner said to pay next time!  That's some belief in your product. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Not sure where the bad reviews are coming from, or high expectation...But this place is pretty decent. Some stuff are a bit pricey for the portion they give, but you can inquire before ordering. This place is quite small and can maybe seat 25+ guest total, but their neat little snacks with ramen and other stuff is intriguing. 

I ordered their 'Avocado Stuffed Seafood' ($5). Its a decent size, and it takes 15 mins to make, but its tasty.

Got their 'Steam Clam Vermicelli Pork Soup'. ($9). This again is decent size, and the taste is very enjoyable again. 

Got their 'Pork Belly Ramen'. This is the same broth like the clams, but the egg was nice and soft runny. The pork belly was nice fatty and tender.

My friends ordered the 'Miso Grilled Eggplant'  ($5) and this eggplant is bigger than my friend's hand. It tasted nice as well. Although $5 for half an eggplant is pricey, but its once you try something like that.

The service is fine too, considering there is one or maybe max two waitress running around food and servicing customers. Overall, I would come back again and try other stuff."}
{"text":"V2 used to be a wonton noodle place at First Markham Place. They have reinvented themselves to be a japanese izakaya.

Lots of interesting snacks. The ox tongue is one of the best. 

The ramen is reasonably good comparing to the ones in uptown.

Even the complimentary jello dessert is not bad at all!"}
{"text":"I think the ramen is average with this price, so does the other dishes. But the black curry stone rice is nice, worth a try to be honest! I have been here quite a lot of times before, because of the curry rice, however, they seems reduce the quality of service and food. The waitress seems very piss off to everyone. Not very good customer service here. They used to have the Japanese red ginger serve with the curry rice and a lychee jello as a dessert to every customer. But now they don't have it!?... I hope this is only one time issue. :/"}
{"text":"Frankly, I would rather have this restaurant remaining a wonderfully secret dining place, than having everyone crowding out its quiet ambience, but some of the negative reviews on Yelp are simply absurd, hence the following review.

The only thing truly bad about this place is that it's location is somewhat inconvenient and hard to find. If it were not for friends' recommendations, I would have never found this place.

I do not come here for drinks, though this is an Izakaya, so my comments are limited to the food.

Ramen and rice ($9-12) are very good, not necessarily the best, but very good quality for the price. One previous review noted that the soup base was \"bland\", which can only be because the reviewer is more used to Ramen soup heavily laced with MSG, which you will NOT find here in any dish. (If you prefer MSG and crowded dining, please go to  Church and Dundas's SanTouka; for MSG and very expensive price, go to Momofuku at Shangri-La, for authentic Japanese MSG Ramen)

The one thing I have noticed about the food here is that the chef seems to have taken particular care in the designs, ingredients, and executions of most dishes. If you only try ramen or rice, you will have missed out, because the menu items that truly show you how good the food is here are the side dishes, call it appetizers or what you will, but they are the reasons I come back here again and again.

Try these and taste for yourself:

- Black Cod $12
- Baked Avocado $5
- Baked Scallop $4.50
- Okonomi $6

Above are listed because they are my favorites, and not once have these disappointed me.

I have never tried Beef tataki here, not being a fan of raw beef, so will say nothing further on this.

Overall, I come here for the cooked food, and I truly believe this place is highly underrated on Yelp, hence this review."}
{"text":"Small Japanese noodle bar very comfy to chill at. They serve special and seasonal dishes you can't find elsewhere.  They also important special Japanese alcoholic beverages hard to find elsewhere. They're soup bases are MSG-FREE and very nice.  They're dishes are well made and very authentic. 

They can do sashimi and other special items upon request but their Ramen noodles and curry rice are fantastic. A basic noodle is about $9.

They are closed on Tuesdays and accepts cash, credit and debit.

The service is good and fast. The resto seats around 48."}
{"text":"Portions were small for the cost. This specific wait staff (with tattoos) looked like she hated her job and did not properly answer our inquiries about the menu items. She wasn't friendly or seemed like she cared about our table. No wonder there were no customers there. I don't recommend this place at al."}
{"text":"Went to this place yesterday with a couple of friends and we had a good time. The food was good, the portions were a bit small for the price and my friend had to pay an extra dollar to make his soup spicy? That's absurd. 

The bad this about this place is the service really. We had to call the waitress multiple times to get her to come over here because she couldnt hear us calling her or wouldn't look towards our table. The big thing here was that when we were paying out bill, one of my friends did not tip. The lady who was different from our waitress instantly screamed out \"Excuse me! You did not pay tip!\"
It didn't end there. I was waiting to pay after him and as I was about to pay the lady again screamed \"You must pay tip!!\" to which my friend said \"Tip is optional\" or something along that line. He ended up not paying tip which outraged the lady making he tell him to get out and never come back again. 
I finished paying and was appalled at what happened. She checked my receipt instantly if i payed tip and glared at me as she handed it to me as if she was trying hard to remember my face. I don't think i'll be coming back here. Such a shame since the food was decent. I doubt my group will be coming back here as there are 2 more ramen places nearby. To lose multiple customers over a tip of $1.50 is quite something."}
{"text":"For a \"Japanese\" Izakaya restaurant, this seemed more like a Chinese styled restaurant, though the prices were intriguingly high for relatively small portions and mediocre food. 

Walking in, the interior design seemed fairly nice and it definitely had a nice tea set to go with the Japanese feel.

As for the food, the BBQ Pork ramen tasted like normal ramen with soup powder and really different BBQ pork. The pan fried scallops were small and expensive. I definitely felt ripped off. The curry beef rice in a stone pot looked appealing at first, but when I tasted it, I felt like I could get better quality at a regular Chinese restaurant. The rice rolls we got in the wooden steamer kept falling apart. 

I really hope improvement will be made later on!"}
{"text":"This location used to be a sushi restaurant but now it has been changed to a Ramen and Izakaya resto.

We came here to try to \"try\" something new, since Scarborough has a bit of a limited compared to the selection from foods downtown. We got here right when they opened and we got our choice of seating. Were offered tea while we flipped through the menu. 

Reading through the menu there is a mix of Ramen/Udon, izakaya dishes, some rice dishes and soups.

We ordered: 
-spicy miso porkbelly ramen (Kind of bummed that they don't have a spicy miso ramen but you have to add $1 to make it spicy :/)
-takoyaki
-ginger chicken
-bowl of rice on the side (we were really craving karage don...so we made our own xD)

We originally wanted to order the pork shokoyagi(?) in a stone pot but the waitress told us its very gingery. So we decided against it.

We asked for extra kewpi mayo, and the lady came out with the squeeze bottle to squirt more onto the plate...which was very odd since usually places just give it on a little plate.

Overall, the ramen base was very half hearted and bland. Didn't compare to other ramen places we've tried. The pork belly was very good melts in your mouth but only 3 slices. Lots of noodles, no extra ingredients like you would get at other ramen places.

Chicken was good with our rice.
Takoyaki was good.

In the end I would not come here again, I can say I've tried it and it's okay only if you're in the area. But if you're looking for something to eat and enjoy then I would suggest go to yonge and sheppard area/downtown for better selection."}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner on a Friday night. It was fairly empty with only 2 other tables seated. So the service was prompt. 

The best part was the owner, she was sitting in the corner with her gigantic plate of crab legs to herself and complaining loudly over the phone  and to her staff that she had no one to eat it with and must have taken 30 photos of the crab legs on her phone. It was just a hilarious gluttony sight to see. 

The food was alright, nothing to complain about. It came out hot and fresh which was good."}
{"text":"Rating: 2.5 

Been to this place a few times and it's alright. Their food is average. Nothing special really. Honestly speaking, I feel like some of their food (especially the ramens) really lack flavour. To me, it's more on the bland side. I have tried some of their other stuff too (like their takoyaki balls) and again, nothing special. 

ps. their god damn teapots are so heavy like holy i literally feel like i'm lifting weights. tryna get some guns while eating here i see 

p.s.s. they give out complimentary dessert (which is either green tea jelly or lychee jelly with those exploding lychee tapioca? balls?) [not sure if they still do it's been a long while since i ate here)

p.s.s.s. totally not slacking off and avoiding studying for my bio midterm by writing this review AYY TOTALLY NOT PFTTT"}
{"text":"This review is written after my third dining experience here (over 4 months).
The service was not very good on two of the three visits. The waitress would go behind the counter and not come back for awhile so it was hard to get any service. This happened on two separate occasions. On one occasion I ordered tenderloins ribs ramen and she brought me pork ramen, I even specifically pointed to the picture but she kept asking me what type of broth I wanted and took my order down incorrectly. 
The food is not good. The pork bone based ramen tasted bland and did not have much flavour at all. The Udon noodles were bad, tasted like flour, as though it was not cooked enough, however the texture indicated it was cooked, so it's not quite clear why it tasted like that. It was so difficult to eat, we didn't finish it. To things worse, the pork that came with it tasted old and stale. So the whole bowl of pork udon was terrible, so bad that we couldn't eat it. 
The ramen that I did eat, had no flavour what so ever, not even from the pork. The pork tasted stale, and I got a terrible upset stomach the following morning after this meal so I will not return- ever.
The only redeeming points are that the Izakaya type foods are decent, not good - just ok. They also serve a variety of sake."}
{"text":"Place to be when you are craving for ramen & stone pot rice uptown!  Choose stone pot rice, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since we have been here but we were looking for something different to eat for Sunday lunch, so we decided to give this place a try.
We walked in at noon on a Sunday and the place wasn't that busy, maybe just another table next to us. My friend who got there before me told me that they were trying to make them sit at a round table instead of the long tables, but in the end they did sit us at the long tables. 

Once we sat down, we were looking at the menus. There are enough choices on the menu, but not a super amount of variety in their dishes. Each one of us ordered a ramen (pork cheek, pork belly, grilled chicken and striploin beef). In addition we got a seafood pancake and ginger chicken.

The portions are not very large. I was not particularly hungry that day so I ate about 2/3 of my bowl, but compared to other ramen places, they didn't have a lot of noodles in there. Also they didn' thave much toppings aside from egg, black fungus (wood ear) and some green onions. I chose the tomato broth which is tomato with the tonkaseu broth. REally like this broth BTW. 

The pork cheek was seasoned quite well. The only thing I didn't like was that the pieces were HUGE. like bigger than the palm of my hand - i got 3 pieces, which i appreciate the amount of protein compared to some of the other choices my friends got... but seriously my mouth was all dirty because i had to bite into the pork cheek with such a large piece lol. But seriously, throw in some corn or something... it just seems so empty without much other toppings.
the noodles were cooked well, but nothing spectular about the noodles.

My friend got the pork belly. three thin pieces of pork belly, not much meat if you ask me.
grilled chicken was okay, didn't look that appetizing though. and then the beef... on the menu makes it sound like steak ramen. it is NOT steak ramen. it was literally the 'fatty beef' one gets from the grocery store for HOT POT. like 3-4 slices. seriously. I was so not impressed that i didn't even want to take a picture (my fiance got that option). 

The seafood pancake was quite good. there was a lot of cabbage in there and some egg, quite tasty, portion was a bit small (it's like the size of a pancake for 5 bucks).
The ginger chicken we decided to order. Seriously. I can go to destiny across the street and order popcorn chicken and feel that spending 7.95 on that was more worth it than the $6 i'm paying for like less than 10 little pieces of fried chicken. it was good, i could taste the ginger, but seriously, their portion sizes really needs some work.

Anyway, I've had better places, probably woudln't want to come back to this place if I had a ramen craving though."}
{"text":"This is probably the ramen place that my boyfriend and I go to the most. At one point, the staff started to recognize us and already knew what we were going to order. 

We always order the tenderous ribs ramen with a tonkatsu (B2 on the menu I think) and I would definitely recommend this. They are really generous with the meat and noodles so it's really filling and it also tastes good. You can also add extra noodles on the side for like $2 or something like that. Also, this place gives you dessert when you get the bill and I like that a lot. 

The only reason why this place isn't 5 stars is because the customer service is not really consistent. Sometimes the staff are friendly, but for the most part just want to get you seated, take your order and go. Would be nice if the servers smiled once in a while! However that makes the service quick, so I appreciate it when I'm in a rush. 

As for atmosphere, the restaurant is never busy when I go- only 2 or 3 other tables seated at max. V2 is also pretty clean, I've never had a problem with dirty utensils or tables. 

Overall, I would say this place is worth checking out. You can get good ramen here without a long wait or breaking the bank (filling ramen with dessert for under or around $10)."}
{"text":"I'll give this place 3 stars for the admirable effort in waitresses trying to attract us. Despite the fact the place was pretty much dead on a Saturday night, but the employees convinced us to eat here even though there were millions of other choices along Silver Star.

We're pretty much set on the fact this place won't compare to Izakaya Ju, Nomé, or Guu. However we still wanna give some of the unique dishes a try here. We tried the tako cucumber appetizer, tako sunomono, octopus skewer, tenderloin skewer, baked mushrooms in cheese, curry beef rice, and seafood cheese udon.

Both the rice and udon were satisfying dishes. The cheese in my udon actually melted better than the one in Kinton (for Kinton the cheese just turns to a giant ball). There could've been a few more seafood pieces, but it was okay. The skewers were all decently grilled. The octopus/tako dishes were all varying: The tako cucumber had that wasabi taste which was a nice spicy kick, but the tako sunomono was easily the disappointment of the meal as the tako pieces were still relatively frozen and it didn't taste to anything at all.

Service was pretty much blah outside from the first 5 minutes and the last 5 minutes. I never got a plate to have the dishes and had to resort to my miso soup bowl...they also never cleared the dishes until the udon and rice orders came; about 30 minutes after initial order, and we finished practically everything then.

I don't mind coming back to try out some new items, particularly their black curry (seems interesting!), or if I'm sick of waiting at Izakaya Ju all the time."}
{"text":"Menu doesn't have a lot of selections. 
The noodles weren't cooked long enough.
Food was ok only."}
{"text":"They use instant noodles rather than real ramen (stretched noodle). It is good to get fast lunch, but it is not a place to enjoy Japanese food."}
{"text":"I lived V2 noodle house way better when they were a wonton noodle place at First Markham Place. Great price,  big selection,  great tastes and quality ingredients.  I was sad they folded.  Tried this new V2 jap noodle house and was disappointed.  Same owners and management,  but average food quality and overpriced items for them quality and portion."}
{"text":"It's been over a year since my last review. I have not downgraded them because they are still as good as before. Very disappointed that they have not become more popular.
Their Ramen are good (not instant noodles), and soup base still as rich but not salty, the meat marinated perfectly. Their skewers seasoned perfectly.
I really don't get why crappy places are packed while this place is not. Are people addicted to MSG for a cheap fill?"}
{"text":"Food: 
Beef tataki: 0 star ($7.00 for 8 slices)
Takoyaki: 3 stars ($4.00 for 4 pieces)
Spicy mayo shrimp: 3.5 stars ($8.50 for 5 pieces)
Grilled chicken ramen: 2 stars ($8 & $2.50 for extra noodles)
Black curry tenderous rib: 2 stars ($10 & $2.50 to change it to black curry)

Overall, everything we ordered was a disappointment. 
We got our beef tataki first and there were 8 dry and lackluster pieces of beef served on a dish of ice with Saran wrap separating the beef and the ice. I'm assuming the ice was just decoration since the tataki was still partially frozen anyway. THE MOST HORRIBLE BEEF TATAKI EVER! AYCE places can do better than this. 
Takoyaki was alright. Not much to be said. Can probably get it elsewhere for a better value but it wasn't bad.
Spicy mayo shrimp was probably my favourite out of everything. Maybe it's the ton of spicy mayo that made it better than it would have been; I do love sauce. However, $8.50 for 5 pieces of crispy shrimp is totally not worth it and definitely something you can live without.
Grilled chicken ramen was meh. I found the soup really bland and watered down. There was barely any flavour in the soup, which is good for those of you who like a lighter soup. Didn't try the chicken. It didn't interest me much after I tried the soup.
After looking through their menu, I was enticed by their black curry. They advertised it like it was an item exclusive to their izakaya so I gave it a shot. It looked pretty cool. Sort of like slowly bubbling black tar. However, the black curry didn't live up to its cool appearance and hype in the menu. I honestly wasn't sure what I was eating. The curry is a little too thick and there was hardly any curry flavour. The ribs were tender so I'll give a star for that. 
I do understand that their prices are probably much lower than most other izakayas out there and you get what you pay for, but I would personally pay the extra dollars and get the real deal. 

Ambiance: 2.5 stars
It was pretty quiet in there and we could hear the waitresses speaking in Cantonese (explicit language included) in the kitchen. They weren't talking smack about us or customers in general, but since I could understand them, it really didn't add to the experience. I felt more like I was eating at a cheap Chinese restaurant than an izakaya. The interior itself is nice though. Simply decorated with little Japanese/Asian ornaments and lanterns.

Service: 4 stars
The service was really the reason why I didn't rate this place as 1 star. We came near their closing time and they still didn't rush us at any part of our meal. It would have been nice if they didn't start cleaning the floors while we were eating but I understand that they were just getting ready to close the restaurant up. The ladies were quick with ordering and serving us our food. One lady even noticed that they made a mistake on my curry while she was bringing it our table and brought it back to be remade."}
{"text":"Something is definitely lacking in my experience at V2 Ramen Izakaya.

I know this is not a Japanese \"Izakaya\", it is more like a Chinese idea of how a Izakaya/ramen joint should be. 

Tenderous Rib Ramen in Tonkotsu Soup ($8.50)
- just try not to drink too much of the soup, if not you will be like me, feeling thirsty....really thirsty after
- Tenderous Rib was quite tender, the noodle was cooked al dente with a nice bite, the half egg was a little overcooked...
- That's what I got for $8.50...  I was still hungry after eating that.... maybe I should order some sides? But this is Scarborough, and this is lunch?!

The photos they uploaded on Yelp are the same one as the menu... they just don't look delicious enough for me to come back... seriously house made cuttlefish balls Ramen.. that's just remind me a lot of what I got at Kenny's Delight in the same plaza."}
{"text":"I came here with two friends a while ago. I can't remember what any of us ordered, but everything was very average. No ramen stood out as particularly good, and it felt more like we were eating just for the sake of finishing our meal. 

I would not come here again."}
{"text":"Not bad at all for a place to get ramen in the Markham area, especially given the price.

I ordered a BBQ pork ramen with a tonkotsu broth (I tried to remain traditional as much as possible) for $8.50 and the results were satisfying for the most part. The noodles had a good springy feel to them and there was a good quantity of it in the bowl. The pork was quite unique; while some parts were a little rougher than I would like, it still maintained a good distribution of fat. It was also seared slightly for a bit of a \"smokey\" taste that bought a new element to the flavours. The egg was fine - nicely softboiled. They did not offer any bamboo shoots, but other traditional toppings such as green onions and black fungus were present. Unfortunately, the black fungus was not cut into strips and I would have preferred it to be cut into strips as in other ramen-yas. The broth was quite smooth and overall, the bowl was not too salty, which is surprising since more often than not, the ramen in the GTA area tends to be overly salty, leaving one dehydrated after the meal.

Green tea is free as soon as you are seated in the restaurant. Fortunately, they offer complimentary dessert as well; a nice lychee-flavoured jello to end off the meal. 

That said, during the time I was here, there was no air conditioning/ventilation, so the entire restaurant was quite stuffy."}
