{"text":"This restaurant is known for their Banh Cuon dish (BC2 on the menu is my go-to) which is a rice roll dish that is stuffed with ground meat and served with fresh herbs, pork sausage, picked veggies, squid party and fish sauce. In my opinion it's the best in Toronto!  In true Vietnamese restaurant style, they serve complimentary tea (hot or cold) to their patrons. They also have an amazing Vietnamese iced-coffee , although it comes from a machine and isn't made with the traditional French drip filters. The restaurant is family-run and seldom packed. Perhaps because the parking lot is an accident waiting to happen! Side street parking is available next to the plaza if there aren't any spots available in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Alright so its not pretty, nor is it anywhere accessible, but this place is the most incredibly authentic Vietnamese restaurant I have ever encountered in Toronto. Banh Cuon are super thin soft rice crepes filled with a mixture of pork and mushrooms. These simple things combined with a dipping sauce made with fish sauce is magical. No one knows about, but everyone should. This is the same stuff you get on the streets of Saigon. Soft supple porky awesomeness."}
{"text":"A great place that's kinda in the middle of nowhere but at least it has parking!  This is a great mom and pop place that has authentic food and a feel good atmosphere.  The first time we were there, we noticed a lot of Vietnamese families eating what looks like it was an omlette with lots of fresh herbs/lettuce to go with.  We decided to order it on one of our visits and it was pretty refreshing with the fresh herbs.    We always have the Banh Cuon here and it's always fresh.  I've learned that not all Vietnamese restaurants serve this because it is quite labour intensive.  It's almost like a Chinese rice noodle roll but not as dense.  Do try it!  Don't be alarmed with the different varieties of Banh Cuon they have on their menu as it's simply the different permutations of the sides with the Banh Cuon.    I love the homely atmosphere and it definately won't break the bank to bring the whole family here.  It's not a shi shi place by any means (read: has TVs for sports events) but it is clean and that's important!"}
{"text":"Decent little family-run Vietnamese place. Popped in before a sporting event for a quick bite and had the chicken com, mango smoothie and tea.  Exactly as ordered. Homey, filling and tasty. Grilled chicken was yummy, soup broth was fine but watch out for the little cup of chopped peppers - they are HOT.  Tea was delicious and so was the smoothie. We'll return for sure."}
{"text":"I went with my coworkers today and ordered a Vermicelli.  Normally this was a great place to go for lunch, however today I found a piece of a wire dishwashing sponge about 1cm long in my dish. I went up to the cashier and showed them what was in my food, and gave the lady the piece that was in my vermicelli. She said sorry then tossed it on the ground. We definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place started off awesome.  Their portions and quality have gone downhill while prices have remained the same.  They started off serving their rice roll order (the ones that come with squid patties) with 3 pieces of the squid patties which were larger than the 1 piece they now serve it with. Came here to eat a couple of nights ago and the rice rolls tasted like they were on the verge of going bad.  Some parts were hard (meaning they had been refrigerated rather than freshly made).  I will be looking for a replacement place for steamed rice rolls."}
{"text":"The best aspect to this particular place is how clean it is inside.  The servers seem very eager to please (although their grasp on the English language seemed iffy making communication a bit of a challenge)  and prices are pretty reasonable.  The food was good but not the greatest I've had (I tried the pork and shimp banh cuon) and the portions were on the smaller side.  Considering how out of the way this place is, not sure if I would return but it's a solid place to stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Steamed rice roll with squid ball is not as good as before; the squid ball is tinier. Worst Bun Bo Hue in town. Snail dishes are tasteless."}
{"text":"I've been eating here more often than I'd like to admit (thanks, dad).   The prices are rather steep for Vietnamese and considering the area, it's not really worth it. What I do like that it's spacious and clean. Service can be iffy at times.  Food: The Bun Bo Hue was not that great. I've made better from scratch with half the ingredients. The Vermicelli was better, loaded with grilled pork and tasty.  Next time I will try the Bahn Cuon, since it's in their name."}
{"text":"Great food very nice staff. I had the snail it was delicious. They closed at 9pm but they let us eat without rushing us. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Best Banh Cuon in the GTA hands down! Fresh, filling, and affordable. I always make sure to visit Thanh Truc's when Im in town. I always make sure to order the special plate of banh cuon which comes with the added dill fish cake, and \"Vietnamese corn bread\" tastes hella bomb."}
{"text":"Lunched here again and we opted for spring rolls; a rice dish with grilled chicken, egg quiche and fried egg; and rice rolls with pork and squid sausage and it was delicious!  Definitely hit the spot!  =====  One of a few Vietnamese restaurants in the same plaza, we decided to finally give it a try, in our quest to narrow down our go-to eatery for future visits.  It's a slightly smaller menu than typical; we went for a Pho special and rice rolls with pork sausage.  Both portions were very satisfactory.  The Pho broth was flavourful and tasted authentic, which is always a yay or nay for a Vietnamese restaurant.  Rice rolls with pork sausage was delicious; it came with a small side of herbs and boiled bean sprouts.  Restaurant is quite spacious, filled with ample natural light and tastefully decorated with an Asian flare.  Prices are a bit on the 'higher end', compared to standard pricing but in no way does it break the bank.  We normally don't venture this way out on St. Clair for Vietnamese fare but when in the area, would definitely return and recommend it!"}
{"text":"Banh cuon is made fresh, although they have become stingy over the years with the portion of meats. DO NOT order their drinks as they make it half ass and not authentic.  I ordered a soy drink cold, the lady who runs the place made it from packaged powder and hot water then added ice... face palm.  Took a sip and threw it out, horrible drink that costed $2.50 , more than the powdered soy from the grocery store itself.  Service is terrible, the owners do not have any sense of customer service and had an attempt to snatch the menu out of my hand when I wasn't finished ordering which resulted in a mini tug of war with the menu, a big wtf moment.  They only accept cash unless their son is working because he's the only one who knows how to work the moneris machine.. another face palm. Shouldn't run a business if you don't know how to accept payment and refuse to make drinks the authentic Vietnamese way.  1 star only for their banh cuon dishes and because I can't rate it lower than 1 star."}
{"text":"Darn, I should've tried the banh cuon as everyone mentioned it here. But I'm not familiar with Vietnamese dishes and wasn't sure if that would be a filling meal so instead I got the bun bo hue for $10! One thing I must say is the prices are really steep! Especially for this area? I could probably get the same for less at Jane Wilson.  Anyway, I found the bun bo hue at bit too salty towards the bottom but overall it was alright. I'll definitely try the banh cuon next time though!"}
{"text":"They serve the best Banh Cuon in Toronto.  I usually order takeout, but the restaurant is also very clean.   I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that every single time I go to Toronto, I probably come here to eat. Of course the banh cuon is delicious, the fish sauce mixed with it perfectly tasted!!! And pho is good too, the soup is fresh and clear, not really salty. Taste good when it's still hot. The rice noodle is also fresh. I don't recommend the avocado milk shake because they put too much ice, but as long as the food is great, who cares?! The owners is really nice and warm-hearted, they have a little super cute granddaughter!!! The atmosphere is perfect for family dinner. I even went here to celebrate my birthday last time. I love this place, this one is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant so far"}
{"text":"After my visit in Vietnam in my last trip, I have been a fan of Banh Cuon to a point where I crave it. Last night my gf and I tried out the other Banh Cuon place in our area. First impression is that look wise, it is better than the traditional Viet places in Toronto. The server immediately spoke to my gf in Viet which have made me think this must be authentic. After tasting their food, I have to say it is. Ironically enough, my gf had the Banh Cuon and I had pho. I know I will always get leftovers from her so I figure I'd order something else. Surprisingly, the pho was so traditional that it put me back having my first taste of pho at the bus station of Da Nang.  The broth was clean tasting and not so fatty like almost most I've had outside of Vietnam. You can tell that they remove the fat out of the broth. The meat was lean and the noodles were the skinny type. Quite tasty. I had some Banh Cuon from my gf and I think it is the best in Toronto. I used to love Phoga Banh Cuon, but I now have a new go to place. It was thinner, servings were better and the sides were tastier. It was closest to authentic I've had. My only issue is the spring roll that we ordered. It was oily and not so tasty so stay away from it. I also had a sinh to which I thought was a great way to end the meal."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place for banh cuon in the Toronto area for a while. The overall food is very good, except I found the ground pork filling a bit dry and lacking some other ingredients. Another thing I noticed was that the price of their other food items are quite a lot more than they should be. An XL bowl of pho is $10.50! Yikes!! I would most certainly drive back here should I be craving another plate of banh cuon."}
{"text":"I haven't visited in a hot minute, but in the months that have passed, I visited last weekend and noticed some changes: Management and food.  Managenent change is not for sure. I've just noticed before that I was always served by the same people as it was a family run business. There *appears* to be a new family running the business now. Service is quicker though, I must say. They had more hands on deck than the couple and their son that previously operated the establishment. Some pros and cons from the change:  Pros:  - quicker service - tea is more fragrant/less watered down - the pork in rice rolls is up to par in quality (STILL SO GOOD)  Cons: - portions got even smaller than before. I ate before I came here and after my meal, I still wasn't full... - The new shrimp cake is very crunchy at the sacrifice of fluffiness and size (still good, but not as good as before)  Overall, I would still come back here when I crave banh cuon because it's still pretty darn good, but I'm not sure the pricepoint is worth it for everyone at the portions they currently serve. Portions are okay, but at the price you pay, you'd expect 5 more bites."}
{"text":"I love my Bun Cuon so I'm constantly trying out new places in search for the best bun coun in town. This resto was recommended by a friend so I found myself in this part of the hood. My first impression was, the area is ghetto. The inside decor was a typical Vietnamese restaurant so you really can't expect much however when there are only 2 customers in the restaurant at 6:30pm, it says something.   More importantly, I expect clean tables so I don't have to look at garbage while I eat!    We sat down and was waited by an old man who didn't speak English, thank god all you need to do is right down your order number on a piece of paper.  The food came pretty timely however, the taste fell flat for me. The roll was very thin and fresh however, there is literally minimum amount of ground pork in each roll with no mushroom visibly in sight. It felt like I was just eating steam flours with pork sausages. A bit disappointed, I give this experience 2/5."}
{"text":"As the weather gets colder, my desire for pho increases.  Decided to try Bahn Cuon Thanh Truc as it was dangerously close to my house and we've driven by it many times.  I hadn't given it a second thought until a Vietnamese coworker vouched for it.  Arrived around 5pm-ish.  The dining room was quiet with a lonely diner at one of the many tables.  Our server brought over menus and I was surprised by the simplicity - only a few choices for pho and vermicelli.  We order one of each and rolls for appetizer.  Food arrived super quick.  Broth in the pho was tasty, not overly salty but I found the beef slices a bit thick and tough.  Generous portion size for the vermicelli.  Meal for $20 even including a pop and taxes.    Definitely will be revisiting as our other pho place in the Junction tends to be much busier.  We liked the ample dining space and the quiet low key atmosphere of this place."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time due to photos on Yelp - good recommendation guys.  We liked the banh cuon there, bun mam, bun Cha ha noi. The Bánh cuon was great and lots of Cha, but the octopus sausage was too small and Bánh Công was just alright. the best Bánh Công I've ever eaten this far is from St clair banh cuon but I like these banh cuon better.  We also tried the snails in coconut - just okay, difficult to eat and remove the snails, sandy and one or two snails were not fresh, would not eat this again. We also tried their Bánh khot w shrimp, again just ok, not as coconutty nor crispy as we like it as we had in Cali. I like it that they had unique specials - like ostrich meat and you can order by trays for pick up. Very friendly and great service. We would definitely return again."}
{"text":"This place is definatley my favourite Vietnamese restaurants to eat at. The very friendly staff add to the pleasant and casual atmosphere and the food is very delicious yet low priced. Also a huge bonus is their two large televisions that currently play the World Cup , and other times entertaining Vietnamese tunes and shows. I recommend the pho, banh xeo, bun rieu, and me being a vegetarian, their vegetarian options are quite tasty. And, if yuh would like an exotic experience, they serve VARIOUS types of snails!!! Personally I have not tried ( too scared) but have heard only great things about it. All in all, a great, yummy, fun restaurant !"}
{"text":"The name of this restaurant just keeped but the owner has changed. I came here bc of my curiousness. This restaurant serves some dishes very different, i can say that maybe only this restaurant has them. They serve some snails and cook them the same in Vietnam and in my country, students like me really love it. There are also more some special food i didnt have space to try all.  But, the taste was not like what I expected. I can say, boring, and hope they will improve. Banh xeo and banh cuon my family also didnt like them. I will try 1 more time go back here to have a new experience.  Service was good, no complain here."}
{"text":"Nova Era Bakery O Cantinho Bakery Vannis Ristorante Ellington's Music Cafe Mi Tierra Restaurant Banh Cuon Thanh Truc  E R  Banh Cuon Thanh Truc  is the Sixth Stop for our November Crawl.  Banh Cuon Thanh Truc did sound promising from the Yelp review, the decor here is a lot more chic and modern than what I would have expected.  Since this stop is really a snack between meals, so we decided to order some appetizers instead of anything substantial.  With Banh Cuon in the name of this location or course we need to order one of those!  Curiously, we ended up with 2 breakfast dish?  -  Banh Cuon Cha Lua Cha Muc Banh Cong ($8) Banh Cuon is a steamed rice roll stuffed with pork, which is a light dish, and is generally eaten for breakfast everywhere in Vietnam. I found the rice roll here on the greasy side and just didn't wow me!  - Banh Xeo ($8) Vietnamese crêpe-type pancakes is made out of rice flour and pan-fried and stuffed with slivers of fatty pork, shrimp, and bean sprouts. Served wrapped with lettuce leaves and stuffed with mint  and other herbs, and dipped in fish sauce.  Talking about humongous portion!! Both dishes though was so so, definitely not the best one I ever ate. Because of health risk involved in eating raw bean sprout, all of them were cooked before they were served to us.  As for my Yelp Friend, I think the most memorable moment at Thanh Truc was not the food or any cute waitress. The clarity of the Blu-ray movie we were watching over our breakfast food where the talk of the evening... and me I just could not get over the nasty smell from the washroom in the basement!  NEXT!"}
