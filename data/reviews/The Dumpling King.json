{"text":"Been coming here for years and its definitely a favourite for dumplings. Service wise, i never compare to standard western restaurants because it will probably lose all its stars. Can't go wrong with this place. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I don't think dumplings are my cup of tea.  People have told me that this place is pretty good compared to other places.  They all taste the same to me.  As soon as I dip my dumpling into the vinegar and hot oil, they all taste alike to me.  When you bite into it,  you get the hot water/broth that gushes out into your mouth and causes you to start sucking air in as quickly as possible to cool things down.  Sometimes, it comes back out and sometimes when you are hungry, you just swallow (this was the case tonight).    We also ordered the beef noodle soup which was alright.  nothing to get all excited about.  we also ordered pan fried dumplings and the goat pancakes.  again, nothing to get excited about.    we than saw someone order a hot soya milk drink.  it actually smelled pretty good as the waitress was walking by so we ordered the same.  the only problem was, our drink looks like it was sitting on the table a bit too long.  by the time it got to our table, there was no smell and it was warm rather than hot.  a bit disappointed.    price wise, not bad.  things are priced pretty good.  not expensive at all.  will i come back...  i don't think so.  not because it was bad, it was more the fact that nothing really excited me.  i was pretty hungry going in, and came out still a bit hungry."}

{"text":"Great food, loved the beef and noodle soup. The soup dumplings were good but Asian legend has better, I love those soup dumplings, they're my new favorite Chinese food. Looks like hand made noodles and dumplings and you can taste the quality."}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. It doesn't get any better than that. Always order the leek, shrimp and pork dumplings and the pork and cabbage dumplings. Takes about 15-20 mins for freshly cooked dumplings to be served.   It isn't the prettiest looking place to eat at, but the food sure is good!  If you dine in, don't forget to check-in on Yelp and get 10% off your order."}
{"text":"First of all, this ain't no five star restaurant, so don't come here if you're expecting a server to come by your table every 10 minutes to ask how your meal is going.   I come here very often, and the food is consistently delicious every time. I always get the boiled pork and leek dumplings and braised beef noodles. I have also tried the pan fried dumplings and green onion pancake, and they're delicious as well!   Pricing is super affordable! Getting full for $20 between 2 people is top notch in my books. Service is pleasant and efficient - none of that fake ish from servers who pretend to care about how your food is.   I love DK and will continue to eat here because they're the best!! :)"}
{"text":"Went back and got the usual pan fried dumpling with leeks which had soup in it as well (4pcs) and got a steam dumpling (12pcs) shrimp and leeks, and got the soup filled dumpling pork (6pcs) and got this noodle dish that is good as well L10 which is sauteed vermicelli with minced pork. Its glass noodle like jap chae style, but taste quite nice. Overall the food has remained consistent and service has remained the usual, not too troublesome...One problem though, we did see mice running around...EEEKKK, maybe it might be risky to eat there if by accident the chef....nvm I'll leave that for you guys to check out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Dumpling King serves up some of the best dumplings in Toronto, while it's location is far from transit and main highways, it's worth a stop for the fresh and expertly prepared dumplings.  The hot and sour soup is one of the best I've had, it was not too spicy, and full of mushrooms, carrots, pork, tofu strips and egg.  We ordered a huge variety of steamed and fried dumplings, both vegetarian and meaty and they were all flavourful, fresh and fantastic.  We also got the chicken fried rice and the seafood noodles, and they were less delicious, the fried rice was flavourless and the egg with the rice was mealy from over-stirring.  Stick with the dumplings, they are huge and certainly the strong point of (duh) the Dumpling King.   It's a small restaurant, probably seats around 30 people tops.  The decor is sparse, with lots of kitschy Chinese decorations, the tables and chairs were cafeteria style as were the place settings.  But for me, it's all about the food, baby!  I went with a group of 8 from work and we managed to stuff ourselves completely for about $10 plus tip. I'd definitely go again for a good, cheap lunch."}
{"text":"I always found it interesting how dumplings can be found throughout the world in different cuisines. Pierogies, mandus, ravioli, empanadas and samosas have a very similar structure, a piece of dough wrapped around some sort of filling.  In Scarborough, just north of Midland Avenue and Finch Avenue there is a restaurant that specializes in the art form of the Chinese dumpling. They make your dumplings as you order to ensure the freshest flavour and quality in their food.  All of their food is homey and incredibly delicious. The beauty in the flavours come from the freshness of the ingredients and how simple each dish was, with no more than a handful of ingredients per dish.  I'd like to note their lamb dumplings which have an excellent gamey flavour to it which goes excellent with a dab of hot sauce (refer to the picture for suggested serving). Their pancakes are also very delicious with the outer crust being flakey while the inside of the pancakes were soft and rich.

{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices! My go-to dumpling place. We attempted to try a new place but had a horrible experience! At the other dumpling restaurant, when we walked in the door, we were greeted by a rude waitress on her phone with a \"seriously?\" so I said F- it! Let's go to Dumpling King. Definitely the smart choice as we were greeted with warm hellos and delicious food :)"}
{"text":"My fav dumpling place.  Friendly service and good food at a very good price.  I have tried many other dumpling places closer to home but I always end up coming back here because no other places compare.  Must try the pan fried pork and leek dumplings, beef foil pancakes or pork layered pancakes."}
{"text":"they have many delicious dishes here. I love and always get the pickled cabbage vermicelli ( i think that is what it's called...) and pork and cabbage dumplings~~~ I also really like their large variety of appetizers including buns and pancakes. yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of dumpling and I usually go to Chinese Dumpling House at Metro Sq to get my fix but this time we decided to try out this dumpling restaurant for a change after hearing great things about it.  From the outside, it looks like a typical mom & pop run restaurant.  Nothing fancy.  The menu, however, has the widest selection of dumplings and other dishes.  We ordered the pork and chai dumpling, the dumpling soup, and their hot and sour soup.  I was pleasantly surprised how smooth their dumpling wrap was and their dumpling soup was amazingly tasty!  I'm not a fan of hot and sour soup but I'm sure it would satisfy picky spicy soup drinker.  Everything was well priced and portions were typical of any dumpling house.  This will probably be my new go to place for dumplings.  Again, this is no fancy shmancy restaurant so I would not recommend it for that hot date you have plans with."}
{"text":"Would typically place this into the \"great and cheap eats\" category but, everything looked so good (especially when I was staring at the food on other people's tables) that I had to order a lot.  soup dumplings: 5/5 (omg...wanted to eat my BF's portion...he usually give me more of something if he sees me eye-balling it but, he was too busy eating... should have just ordered two portions...yes...I will do that next time)  steamed pork and chive dumplings: 4/5  pan-fried dumplings: pork and cabbage 3/5 (was oozing with grease... not like bacon grease where you just want to douse everything with it but, excess grease...had to use a tissue to blot)  beef pancake roll: 5/5 (omg so good)"}
{"text":"This place looks pretty sketchy but serves up some good food. It was chosen as one of the best dumpling places in Toronto by BlogTO readers, so that should tell you something, especially since BlogTO hardly ever mentions anyplace this far north.  The dumplings here are of course the main feature and they're quite good. Other food is somewhat hit & miss. I recall that the eggplant was pretty good, the fried rice was good too. Service is basic, ie, you'll probably have to flag them down to get anything, don't expect them to come to your table to check up on you. The decor is pretty drab too, so it's not a place you'd take a date, but for some relatively cheap food it's one of the better dumpling places I've been to.  (Random story: The first time I was here with some friends of mine, we had just received our first dishes when we heard a scream from the kitchen, apparently one of the cooks had burned herself. :( So then we had paramedics on the scene. We felt bad and left an extra large tip for the poor lady!)"}
{"text":"Great place for those dumpling cravings!  Came here as a party of two at around 9PM on a Saturday night and were seated right away. For two people we ordered four different dumpling plates and dessert. All the dumplings we ordered tasted great. Our favourite of the night was the steamed corn and pork dumplings.   They only accept cash and debit as methods of payment. Our bill totalled to roughly $20/person (including the Yelp promotion). We left full and satisfied.   They also provide take-out options, and I overheard a customer mentioning picking up an order made through the phone.  Will most likely visit again!"}
{"text":"Not much to the restaurant in terms of decor. So don't expect anything fancy. But the food is on par! Dumplings are home made and are juicy - they come out super hot and steaming. Super tasty. Soup noodles are great too (beef brisket noodles). Definitely one of those places you want to keep going back for more."}
{"text":"Super busy place! Even at around 2pm, which is the time I use to visit restaurants when I want to avoid other people :P Seems to be a popular location among the Asian population, which I wish had attested to its food.  Unfortunately, that turned out not to be the case. While the dumpling fillings were flavoured quite well, they were really dry. Even the soup dumplings had almost no soup! THAT is a travesty in my opinion. I also thought that the wrappers were on the thicker side, although this is a relatively minor offence. The only redeeming grace of the meal was the hot and sour soup - but it's pretty hard to screw that up...  Prices seem a bit high (I think they've raised prices again compared to pictures of the menu I saw a few months ago). This is because the environment isn't that great - the tables were kinda sticky and gross, utensils were sketchy looking, and the staff looked unfriendly. Usually I don't mind this at other dumpling restaurants, which is the definition of comfort food, but those places are also dirt cheap. As with these family style places you should also expect tons of screaming kids and so on.  Moving on to hunt for other dumplings..."}
{"text":"What a find. Tucked away in the corner of a plaza dominated by KBBQ, hot pot, and the juggernaut Keung Kee, this quaint dumpling place is a treat.  They definitely live up to their name. The dumplings are plump, not too hot, and full of flavor. There isn't a lack of meat like a lot of other places, and all 3 types (steamed, boiled, pan fried) are good. I had the pork/leek dumplings boiled, the house special dumplings fried, and the lamb dumplings steamed.   Among other things, we had the lamb skewers. They come in a plate of 8 for $7.99. They aren't grilled, but instead fried, so expect that. A little on the oily end, but very flavorful and cumin-y, just how I like it.  This place is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This place has great comfort Chinese food. Lamb skewers, dumplings, beef noodle soup, etc. The food is very flavorful and quantity is good.  Interior of the place is just an average get in get out place and service is good."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome surprise when all dishes that we ordered were delicious and practically addicting.  It was a surprise that each bite of the steamed shrimp and pork dumpling was satisfying and tasty. I would also recommend the beef and mushroom stir fry. The sumptuous meaty mushroom held its own with the beef.  We will definitely be back once again"}
{"text":"This place holds true to its name- it's dumplings are delicious! All the other foods are pretty standard (hot and sour soup was terrible). Food portions are really large (can serve at least 4 people). The waitress failed to tell us that (there was only two of us) so be warned! I would definitely go back just to try the dumplings again."}
{"text":"The dumplings are awesome here. They give you 12 for around 6$ and it tastes amazing. I love going here for dumplings. It's probably my favourite dumpling place in Scarborough, and it doesn't hurt that it's right near my house. However, the people who work here don't seem very excited, but that is sort of the norm. Go here for the dumplings but not the service. I would prefer getting take out instead of dining in."}
{"text":"Food 4/5 (50% of final grade)  The steamed dumplings gush super hot lava of pork soup and flavour on the first bite. The pan-fried dumplings deliver an \"ouch!\" moment followed by culinary excellence. This dumpling place tastes pretty authentic and up to standard. Definitely a place to go back to time and time again for a small group of friends or family!  Ambiance 2.5/5 (15% of final grade)  The establishment itself wasn't extravagant at all, but a very typical Northern Chinese restaurant. That being said, they feel clean enough, and is definitely a place most natives would feel very comfortable in--not too extravagant and very homely. Up to par, so to speak.  Service 2.5/5 (15% of final grade)  Service is pretty standard for an authentic Chinese restaurant-- wave them down, or else they won't come to you, even when it's not busy at all. They did, however, deliver the menus right after we sat down, and came promptly on command, which gives them an up-to-par status. The food came at appropriate time intervals, but the service isn't something people would comment on, good or bad.  Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)  The price is pretty fair for the quality of the food, and the ambiance. Though not considered \"cheap\" for lunch, it is very nice for a casual dinner among friends. In general, affordable, but standard and not especially amazing quality for price, though the food quality was decent enough for me to consider it for dinner whenever I'm in the area.  Other 2/5 (10% of final grade) Brownie points round! My friend and I were seated right when we stepped through the door! That was pretty nice.   Final Grade = 64/100 = 3 stars!  Summary: Yum is its name! Definitely check this out if you want some casual Northern-Chinese food, and if you're in the area! Not a place for you to hike to if you aren't in the area though. I won't drive any more than 15 minutes for a place like this one :)"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant recommended by my friend. Shanghai food is one of my favourites and this place actually serves it well! I liked it a lot especially its dumplings (which they are famous for).  This is a small restaurant yet very authentic looking in the inside. Not many tables but good enough to accomodate. Service was good, nothing too much to comment - just remember to bring cash or debit only for the bill.  I had a chance to taste their steamed lamb dumplings, fried fennel and pork dumplings, typical soup buns (xiao long bao), and a plate of glass noodles with minced pork.  Both types of dumplings were delicious. Some people may not like the taste of lamb in general, but if you do it's a good choice. The fennel dumplings were very interesting, it gave it a dill pickle-like flavour. I loved it and recommend this too. As for the dumpling and bun outer layer, it wasn't too thick and was made well.  The noodles reminded me of korean chap chae but more saucy. Overall, it's a great Shanghai restaurant in the Scarborough hood if you want some place different than the chains."}
{"text":"This place is so good! It's a nice little restaurant and the food is amazing. I really like most of their dishes. Definitely recommend for this type of Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Ordered the sweet beef wrap and it was delicious. Would come to order it again next time"}
{"text":"HAIR IN FOOD! AND PISS POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE  Decided to come here for some lunch, had good reviews so i figured it would be a a good opportunity. Anyhow, got there and got a table right away. Rest of the service was very poor. Took a very long time to place our orders - it almost felt like we were the odd family out. They would go to other tables who were Chinese, but for us (not Chinese) they would either walk right past us or not even check up. It could be just me, but that's definitely what it felt like.   Anyhow, we ordered some soup bowl with vermicelli, dumplings, fried rice, some noodles, and some pork pancakes.   Vermicelli soup bowl: Presentation was really nice, but overall the soup was bland and not good at all. definitely avoid.  Fried rice: was MEH. For this price (I believe around $12), you can get it wayyyyy better at other places.   Beef pancakes: Actually not too bad - the only thing that was appetizing. We ordered only 1, but they brought us 2 and charged us for that. That's fine, but they need to pay attention to what the customer actually orders.   Dumplings: for a place that calls itself the 'Dumpling King'. Their dumplings taste like frozen ones from the grocery store at best. It was edible, but that's about it.   Fried noodles: I left this one last for a reason. A: it was below average and B: we found a long hair in our noodles. Probably only one person dug into the plate before we found it, but when we brought it up to the attention of the server she looked dumbfounded and went to her supervisor or manager. This person was more younger looking and can speak english much better than the others. But when we told her, she denied it and refused to take it back. Are you kidding me? She said, it could have been our hair that fell into it and that she isn't going to do anything about it. Probably one of the worst responses i have ever heard. Definitely won't be back there.   In summary: Poor food, poor customer service. don't go"}
{"text":"I can't read Chinese (banner in front of store) but there something going on.   ***Special Note regarding Banner: The Dumpling King is celebrating our 15th anniversary!  To thank our loyal customers, we are giving away frozen dumplings on orders with a minimum purchase of $30 before taxes.  You have a choice of 12 frozen pork dumplings or 10 frozen vegetarian dumplings. This special promotion begins on January 1, 2013 till June 1, 2013.*** Thanks Wayne C for translating!  Decor has changed slightly, still a hole in the wall.  A few food items on original menu was scratched off/taped over with paper but my favourites are still in tack :)  Not sure, if this is a promotion but if you spent $30.00 on food. You get a bag of their frozen dumplings. Waitress was cute because she tried to inform us that the dumplings are frozen and you had to boil them in English. We do cook, so I think she meant to say, steam dumplings :)"}
{"text":"I came here expecting the best dumplings from the dumpling king himself.   And that's what I got. The pan fried dumpling is fresh and were one of the best I've ever had. However, the popular siu long bao was lacking. The flavour didn't hit the spot as I was expecting from a very popular Chinese dish. They also didn't have red vinegar to pair with it.   Another must order dish are the beef noodles as stated in other reviews. They are the best I've ever had. Period. The meat is soft and the noodles are freshly made. The soup base is good and similar to the Taiwanese style iteration of this dish.   Prices are reasonable and is worth it for freshly made dumplings and noodles."}
{"text":"This place has some real good chinese food. They offer a variety of dishes, ranging from noodles to soups and dumplings. Wasn't a big fan of the sour/spicy soup but absolutely loved their popular pork meatball soup with bok choi and vermicelli--the broth was so deliciously light and delicate and the meat was tender and juicy. This is a must-try dish!! Loved their boiled dumplings as well.  Some of their dishes are on the salty side (cold pork belly, beef noodles) so although extremely flavourful, you can't eat too much at once--they are best shared with others in small portion.   Service was fine. Atmosphere could be more welcoming but the food is really more what I would come here for."}
{"text":"We were meeting a friend and got lost, and ended up first at \"Chinese Dumpling House\" at 4188 Finch Ave East.  It was disgusting.  I trust my friend, so I was really confused.  She called a few minutes later asking where we were; she was there but didn't see us?  Score! We were in the wrong place!  Ran outta there so fast...  Dumpling King is MUCH nicer.  Service was as expected, you have to remind them of things if you don't write them on the paper.  Food was good, hot, fresh.  So many choices on the menu (not very descriptive if you just read English so who knows what you're really ordering).  I'm never up there, but I'd go back if for some reason I was."}
{"text":"Small little place but it was surprisingly lovely! The food was good and the place is nice and clean. The dumplings were juicy and the soups were flavourful. The beef wrapped in a pancake was great and the service was decent. I'm pretty excited to find another dumpling shop to compare against my regular joint at Times Square (Leslie & 7) - and while I gave this place a good scrutinizing, it still held up really well against all my standards. I was happy to say that all the dishes we ordered were good.   If you're looking for a dumpling joint, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I LOVE dumplings and this place has SO many options. I love their boiled dumplings way more than their fried ones though.  Downside: sometimes the wait for my order is a tad long... but I guess it's understandable since it probably takes while to cook the food.  My absolute favorite dishes from here are their shrimp, pork, and cabbage dumplings (A2) and their xiao long bao (translation on their menu -\"steamed mini pork dumplings\").  I wished they opened earlier, because I would love this for breakfast too. Check in on Yelp for 10% off your order ;)"}
{"text":"This restaurant always seems busy, which is never a bad sign. We've been here 4 times and it never disappoints. The dumplings here are delicious and made in house, fresh and ready to serve. The smoked duck is awesome."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food at this place! Everything tasted very authentic. We had two kinds of dumplings, leek and egg pancake and kao mantou! The place is very nicely decorated and clean! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've been fortunate to be on a awesome Chinese food streak lately.  Much as I also love hoity toity restaurants downtown, the simple, yet complex flavours and methods of good Chinese cooking is something so drool-worthy.  Between the three of us, we ordered 2 plates of steamed (boiled?) dumplings - pork with leek, etc - which was decent.  The pan fried large dumplings were so good, with delicious juices simply floating inside the perfectly fried skin.  We also had the rice with various preserved meats topped with fresh shredded lettuce that was served inside a wooden container.  It is so bad for your waistline, but completely irresistible.  I'm sure it put my sodium count for the day over the top as well, but it didn't really matter as I gobbled it all up anyway."}
{"text":"Had the A25 pan fried pork and cabbage dumplings, they were really good- lots of flavour, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Good portion sizes. My friend had the steamed dumplings and said they were just okay.  The service was really slow...and there was an unfriendly vibe to the place."}
{"text":"Pretty good dumplings! I had the pork with leek. Also tried a bit of the noodles with the minced pork. Looking to trying more items from here next time when I actually have time to dine it. :)"}
{"text":"Dumplings and fried noodles were great! Fair priced and generous portion. Definitely coming back when I'm in the area. Cash and debit only"}
{"text":"You don't go to a steak house to order chicken.  You most certainly don't go to a dumpling house to order anything but dumplings.  This cardinal rule should be in bold when it comes to uptown dumpling houses.  Having eaten at Dumpling King three times, I've personally never ordered anything besides their rice-wrapped gifts, but, in the company of friends, I have tasted their other, less savoury dishes.  The short: avoid the non-dumpling dishes.  All three of my visits have been - from the dumpling perspective - great.  While there are no servers who speak English, they do keep a literally translated English menu for us wayward foodventurers.  Service is swift and stiff - we had no luck asking for spicy oil due to a communication breakdown, but I'm sure it would have arrived promptly.  Prices range from $4.50 - $6.99 per plate of dumplings.  The restaurant itself is pretty much a clean, kempt square.  Chairs and tables are typical plastic with the wrap-n-wash tablecloth.  There is absolutely no decoration beyond a large screen TV that kept the other patrons rapt in excitement.  Our server was prompt at providing water and taking our written order.  Pro-tip: the beer is cheap; if they had public transit, they'd earn an extra star.  Food took a swift 10 minutes to arrive, and when it did, it was steaming, enticing, and brief.  My friend and I ordered two batches of boiled dumplings and one pan-fried set.  The boiled dumplings were tasty, erring on the side of salty (the best side to err on) while still retaining the delicate flavours of the leek and pork, and shrimp, egg and chives.  Their pièce de résistance was their pan-fried mushroom and chicken: huge, wide, flat dumplings that hold a bowl of won ton soup inside their crispy folds.  My first bite was pure glory: bits of chicken and mushroom high-fiving my taste buds.  CAUTION: use protection if it's your first time.  These huge dumplings have a (hilarious) tendency to explode.  Our bill was a piddling $17, including beer for two.  The price is good, the food is standard fare.  There were no specialty dumpling options.  Dumpling King definitely scratches the dumpling itch, but if you're travelling far, there's tastier destinations."}
{"text":"Ive been to this restaurant a couple of times. I live on the west end of toronto, and I travel all the way to this restaurant just ro eat their delicious meals. So here is what i think of this restaurant:  Food: 4/5 - great selections of dishes.  Dishes are quite exotic such as pigs ears, intestines, liver etc. but they taste quite amazing. Dumplings here is amazing (fried or steamed) - one of the best dumpling ever tried. Im a dumling lover so take it from a pro ;)  ambiance: 2/5 - not the prettiest and cleanest restaurant. Typical chinesses restaurant. Definitely not \"date\" worthy. Great to go with families and friends  prices range: from $4 - $16 Most of the dishes worth $7.99  - i definitely would go back to try some more of their cold platters. And the rest of their dishes.  - if you want to go eat dumplings and have other varieties of dishes!! This is a great place to go to."}
{"text":"Went to Dumpling King today for lunch (first time, found the place on the Internet after a severe dumpling craving) but when we got there... YELLOW CONDITIONAL PASS sign in the window!!! Unsanitary food preparation/ storage conditions, etc. Needless to say we turned around. Maybe the food is still good (a few people with strong stomachs and/or bad eyesight were having lunch) but I didn't want to take a chance. Just thought I'd share this with other people before they drive all the way there."}
{"text":"After having tried Dumpling Restaurant on Brimley and Sheppard during high school, dumplings have become my version of McDonald's.  They are delicious, quick to receive, and come in a high quantity for a cheap price.  Therefore, I was psyched to discover a new dumpling restaurant in my part of the woods and that their fare fits into all the mentioned criteria.  The Dumpling King is located near Midland and Finch.  It's in the plaza that is right behind the Sky Plaza, and it is directly opposite to Latea Era and Snow Time. Effectively, this means that customers can conveniently go for dessert right after a few platefuls of dumplings. Proximity-wise, it's very close to JXY Dumplings in the Sky Plaza.  However, I highly recommend passing on JXY and going here instead because The Dumpling King's price, quality, and interior decor are up an ante.   With a party of three, we easily filled ourselves up with four orders of dumplings and a side of beer.  We ordered:  - lamb dumplings - leek, shrimp, and pork dumplings (A1) - steamed bok choi dumplings  - pan-fried cabbage and pork dumplings - tsingtao beer  Our order was large in quantity, but we didn't break the bank. Similar to other dumpling restaurants, you get a dozen or so dumplings for a little over five dollars. Here, the average portion to price ratio is about 7 dollars for 12 dumplings, so they are still relatively cheap eats, despite serving two or so fewer dumplings compared to Dumpling Restaurant (Brimley and Sheppard).  Plus, the beer is extremely affordable here; bottles of domestic beer are $3 each and the Chinese kind only costs 50 cents more!     My party and I were happy campers while we ate. I loved the lamb dumplings the most because the gaminess of the meat added depth to the broth inside the wrapper, and this is coming from someone who often dislikes lamb and other gamey meats!  The favourite for the other two in my party was A1, the leek, shrimp, and pork dumpling.  Personally, this variation was decent at best. It felt like a standard pork dumpling, but the shrimp was somewhat flavourless and functioned more for enhancing the texture.    While I can safely testify that most, if not all, the dumpling varieties here are flavourful, there are still a few caveats. Firstly, the wrappers here are on the thicker side.  Some, like my bf, prefer thicker wrappers, but I find that they don't absorb the broth that they hold inside as well. Secondly, there is only a moderate volume of broth inside each dumpling.  This may be a plus for some, but I honestly prefer having the broth gush out with every bite!  Thirdly, the bok choi dumpling did not have a ''milky\" broth and strong flavour. It was in stark contrast to the bok choi dumpling at Dumpling Restaurant (Brimley and Sheppard), which was so appetizing that it has become the epitome for me!  Lastly, their pan-fried dumplings are a little on the oilier side compared to ones I've eaten elsewhere.  However, they come in larger quantities compared to the pan-fried varieties served in other restaurants and there is a strong flavour for both the meat and broth, so I would still highly recommend them.    Overall, I can see myself becoming a regular here.   I love the affordability of the food, which, albeit the caveats that I mentioned before, is still in good standing.  Also, I love the convenience of feasting on dumplings here before going to Latea Era, Co Co, Snow Time, Double Ming, and all the other dessert restaurants that are within a 5 minute walk from it.  My bf really enjoyed himself here as well.  He was probably more excited than me, so we will probably be doing a combination of The Dumpling King and Snow Time for many future dates."}
{"text":"Love!! We had the shrimp and pork dumplings, lamb dumplings, steamed pork and crab meat dumplings and they were all to die for.  The service is super fast, and the waitresses definitely know every item on their large menu. Would highly recommend you give this place a try, when you are having those serious dumpling cravings!"}
{"text":"This is my second time here. What a delight.. I love this place! The food is definitely worth the price. The noodle soups do have a bit of MSG, but I can look pass that! The food is great, especially the dumplings. Holy hell, they are heavenly.. I've had dumplings that were like this, but those days are gone.. So.. thank God I found you I was lost without you lol  Thank you, Dumpling King! 4.75 stars! .25 deduction for MSG."}
{"text":"Today, I'm going to introduce you to The Dumpling King ! It's located in the same plaza as Korean Grill House and CoCo at Midland and Finch.  I came here with my parents and they did the ordering so forgive me as I don't know the name of these dishes.  Clear glass noodles with vegetables and pork balls in soup! This is probably one of the best dishes I've tried when I came here! It's a simple dish of soup, glass noodles, vegetables and pork balls. It comes in a stand with a heat source at the bottom, ensuring that the soup is always hot. I love the broth! It's very soothing and yummy. Love this dish!!   We also ordered some spicy pig intestines - which were so so yummy! This is biased because I love pig intestines because they're so chewy. This dish also came with quite a number of onions.  We got beef wraps as well. I only had one, they were okay to me as I couldn't taste much of the meat. If you order this dish, it comes with 4 wraps - perfect for families.  This Spicy Minced Meat Noodles also came with vegetables but not a lot of veggies. We mixed the noodles with the spice so it would be evenly spread but I could feel the spicy kick for this dish.  As their name states, I would assume Dumpling King is known or good at their dumplings dishes. We ordered their Pan-Fried dumplings as well as their Steamed Dumplings. I enjoyed their dumplings here, plus they actually make their dumplings in-house! You can view it near the cashier area. They also have tons of different fillings for their dumplings here.  I've been to Dumpling King a few times now, and I've always ordered the 1st dish, which was the glass noodles with soup! It's so gooood - can't find it anywhere else. And some variation of dumplings as well.  I definitely recommend this place, but their seating is kind of tight. They do have tables that fit about 6-7 people, but more tables of 4s. Parking here is also quite tight and somewhat limited but you can park in the back and walk.  Best thing about eating here is that I will grab bubble tea as dessert from CoCo after!"}
{"text":"Still my favourite place in the GTA for dumplings. They updated the menu so the numbers in my earlier reviews may not be the same but the items itself are still there. Look below/my earlier review for my family's staples!!!  They added a few more things to the menu including a side menu on a single card. Most things on that menu are really including the wood ear mushroom salad. Omg sweet tangy garlicy crunchy goodness.  As much as I love this place - they're not the best at everything. I recommend not getting the siu long bao/soup dumplings - not enough soup in them i find and tiny. I think that's the only thing i can recommend to not try - everything else I've tried is great!"}
{"text":"Superb! Had a great experience. Ordered chicken - mushroom dumplings and fish in chilly oil. Both the dishes were delicious. I am so impressed there fish. What a dish!  Taste, spice, quantity, flavor everything was perfect. Fallen in love with that fish. Will be taking my friends next week.  Service was a bit slow so one star less for that.  Overall a place to relish some good food."}
{"text":"3.5 to 4 stars.  We ordered the steamed leek and pork dumplings, pan fried mini pork buns and xiao long bao (soup filled dumplings).  I was pleasantly surprised the leek and pork dumplings were juicy!  The xiao long bao were good too but the wrap was a bit thick when compared to Ding Tai Fung.  The pan fried mini pork buns were not bad but would be better if there was more filling.  Overall, we were satisfied with our visit.  We also got a 10% Yelp check in discount.  We would come back when we have that dumpling craving!"}
{"text":"One of my yelp friends checks in here every single week and I've been so curious to try this place out and finally did a couple weeks ago with my bf.  We ordered boiled pork dumplings, steamed lamb dumplings, sweet potato and eggplant in sauce and a soup with bok choy, meatballs and glass noodles.   Everything came out fairly quick and tasted delicious, I can see why this place is a favourite amongst yelpers. Of the two dumplings dishes we ordered, I preferred the boiled ones better than steamed. The eggplant and sweet potato dish was really good and I really liked how the sweet potatoes were crispy on the ends.   The only thing I didn't like about this place is that it is a bit run down and my plates and utensils still had a greasy feel to it, like it wasn't cleaned properly. Other than that, everything else is good, I'd probably come back again to try out items on the menu."}
{"text":"My friend suggested we come here since I was craving for soup-filled dumplings and we were in the area. I was a little hesitant since I read on Yelp that they had received a yellow \"Conditional Pass\" from the city but I was happy to see that they currently sport a green \"Pass\" sign on their wall.   The interior was bright and seemed cleaned. They weren't very busy on a Friday evening.  We ordered the Pan-fried Pancake w/ Green Onions. This was pretty bland but I liked the texture and it was salvageable with their chili sauce. The steamed Bok Choy Dumplings were plump with lots of filling but I feel if they were seasoned a little more it'd taste even better. The Pan- fried Leek and Pork Pot Stickers were huge and very juicy! They were fried perfectly golden brown. Loved those! The Soup Dumplings were pretty good but nothing amazing.   Everything arrived fast and hot.  Service was polite and prompt. Nothing to complain about.   The bill for two was $20 + tips.  Overall I'd give this place 3.5 stars for what it is; cheap, fast, and tasty."}
{"text":"It's been rather good both times that I've come here. It's consistent and the food is flavourful with enough variety as well. It's in a convenient location and they're opened late enough if you're hungry after being out. The decor is decent as well for those who like eating in style."}
{"text":"Dumpling King!! The dumpling King is located in the Midland plaza by Midland and Finch!  Parking was not bad when I went at 12pm on a weekday - usually parking is super difficult to find in this plaza!   For a dumpling restaurant, many people go for the dumplings! There's a special dish of dumplings that a lot of people go for, which is the one with a thin layer of crispy pan fried dough right under the dumplings. Personally, I thought this dish was special, but oily!  I also got the rice wrapped around fried dough and dried pork pieces and the beef with noodles.   My favourite dish was the beef meet and noodles, it had a slightly different taste to it, though I couldn't tell if it was an added herb or something different that enhanced the taste. The other dishes weren't particularly special to me though."}
{"text":"I am a fan of dumplings. The dumplings at this restaurants were made from scratch (I was watching one of the ladies that worked at the restaurant make the dumplings) and filing was properly seasoned. The dough for the dumpling was good too. Over all I really enjoyed the dumplings.  I tried other dishes too and I thought they were good. But my favorite would have to be the dumplings."}
{"text":"A decent joint for affordable northern Chinese cuisine, especially for dumplings. There are over a dozen types of dumplings to choose from which include two vegan friendly dumpling options, which I very much appreciate :). A steamer of 12 dumplings will set you back $6-7, which is not a bad price. The dough had a good chew, but the bottoms were slightly soggy, so a few unravelled when they were picked up unfortunately. Other than that, the flavour was very good. Not overly salty nor bland; a perfect balance that reminded me a lot of dumplings I had back in northern China.   We also tried their corn bread which was unfortunately not very tasty. The texture was lumpy and dry. I would've much rather have had a man tau. Also a miss was their hot sauce. Usually a little hot sauce helps bring out the flavour of the dumplings, but their hot sauce is bitter and doesn't compliment the dumplings at all.   Service was also a little slow. It was about a 15 minute wait for our first dish after we placed our order. I also overheard another customer cancelling an order because it took too long to come, which is never a good thing. But, like the majority of authentic Chinese restaurants, great all around service is never a priority, so this really doesn't come as a surprise.   My boyfriend had their beef roll which he said good flavour, but it was lacking veggies/herbs, like scallions and cucumbers, that give a beef roll that crunch."}
{"text":"Update 2 Summary: it's DUMPLING king, not veggie king nor green onion pancake king nor noodle king  Top Must-Get: lamb dumplings Top Regret: Bak choy/appetizers  OKAY, you ever get that feeling while walking through a restaurant that you want to just grab some food from other people's plates because they look so good?  Well I don't, because that's weird. BUT if that feeling happened to you at Dumpling King, I'd understand. They have the best lamb dumplings and the best home style pan fried dumplings in town. Juicy, tender, yumminess and now served in classy new plates.  But everything else is sort of meh. The plate of veggies was small, and the classic green onion pancake tasted like green onion soggy bread. No crunchiness or crispness at all.  However... You come for the dumplings, and you stay for the dumplings, and it's what keeps this a four star."}
{"text":"I'll give it a 2.5. I mean, it's solid, but for value, it's lacking. Off the top of my head, I can easily think of 3-4 dumpling restaurants hat surpass this for price and value.   We had the pork and leek steamed dumplings last night. Going by the rather dry flap of dumpling wrapper on the top of each off the dumplings, I'd say either these have been sitting around for a while, or they don't have enough filling in them. Or both. At at least $7.50 for 12-15 dumplings, it's not the best dumpling deal in town. They were by no means bad dumplings. I've just had better.  We also ordered the sweet and sour pork chops. I think that's what it was. Not sweet and sour pork like the Cantonese red stuff. This was more black vinegar and less sugar. The meat was also super thin and almost like jerky. The sauce and the green onion/ginger/cilantro shreds on top were good though.  The xiao long bao (soup dumplings) had decently thin wrappers and were decently priced, but I had two of the six that came in one order and neither of them had soup in them. One of them had a visible hole in it before I even touched it. Not cool.   The pan fried pork dumplings with the fried lattice at the bottom were alright in price and taste, but the lattice at the bottom wasn't evenly golden brown. In fact, some places weren't brown and some were rather dark. The dumpling skins were also thicker than I'd like.  They have this really cute leaf shaped steamed bun. They call it a hot and sweet pork bun. It's hot. It's not sweet. It's filled with pork bits and a mix of veggies in some sort of hot sauce, and tastes predominantly like spicy bamboo shoots. The bun was pleasantly fluffy and the insides were rather spicy.  Service here leaves something to be desired. When putting down one of our dishes, one of the waitresses bumped into my dad's teacup and it splashed over the table. She definitely noticed it and moved as if to do something, but then didn't apologize or do anything and just walked away. Not cool.  If I'm in the mood for dumplings, I doubt I'll be back. I know there's better dumplings as close as a plaza away."}
{"text":"Not good value - poor service - mediocre   I cannot say I would recommend this place. I went on a Friday with about 8 other coworkers. It took forever to get seated and then it was a battle to get served. Everyone's food came out at different times and some of it wasn't even hot. The server actually looked annoyed to be there. At the end of it he didn't even want to split our bills... the whole thing was very awkward.  Finally we all had stomach problems once we got back to the office. Coincidence... I think not. Save yourself and please dine else where for your dumps people."}
{"text":"Ever since Ding Tai Fung in Markham went downhill I've been desperately searching for a dumpling place for my random dumpling cravings. I think I've finally found the place!  Most dumpling restaurant are old school basic ghetto but this place is actually not too bad and clean. Service is super prompt and the food is very fresh.  I enjoyed the sweet and sour soup, dragon soup dumplings and pan fried web dumplings. Lub them all!   I'll definitely be back for round 2."}
{"text":"Such a nice neighbourhood gem! I came here on a Saturday evening and its definitely almost a full house. It is quite small inside with not many tables. But staff and food are both good! I got the fried pork dumpling which comes in 12 pieces for 6.99. The skin was thin and very crispy. The filling was so good too. It goes really well with the chilli sauce with vinegar. Then came the sweet and sour fish for 10.99. Perfect amount of sweet and sour. The fish was fried to perfection. So crispy. Goes really well with the sauce. I would actually tell them to seperate sauce and fish next time because we ate it too slow and the fish got soggy towards the end. Seperating the sauce and fish will ensure the crispiness. Then we got the beef noodle for 7.99. The broth was extremely flavourful with a hint of spiciness. Im pretty sure the noodles were handmade because it was quite fresh and chewy. The beef was so tender and flavourful. I will definitely be coming back in the future. Everything I had today was fresh and czme out steaming hot. There was only one girl working today and boy was she busy. She was still really tendative and nice."}
{"text":"Don't let this unassuming restaurant fool you, Dumpling King makes some of the best dumplings in the city! It's a well-lit place with tons of seating so it's ideal for large groups. When you walk in you'll see the chef at a counter in the back making the dumplings fresh.   My staples are:  * Crispy pan-fried cabbage and pork dumplings - this comes with a crunchy skirt on top that adds great texture * Braised beef and pancake wrapped in foil - the best here! The beef is seasoned with a sweet hoisin-like sauce.  * Pan fried pancake with green onions * Steamed mini pork dumplings - these are soup dumplings! Careful, they're hot!  I also get dumplings that are steamed/fried with different fillings to try. So far those listed above are my favourites. There is black vinegar, chili sauce, and fresh ginger slices for you to dip the dumplings in.   Although I don't eat lamb, I was told the lamb dumplings are delightful and that not many restaurants have them. I would recommend that dumplings and the beef pancake in foil are your best bets here. I've tried other things on the menu that pale in comparison to the little bags of meaty goodness. Specifically, the braised beef noodle soup was quite bland. Five stars for the quality of the dumplings!!  Service is not the best, but the delicious food more than offsets that. Free parking is easily found in the lot right outside."}
{"text":"If you like dumplings this is the place. Reasonable price, clean, food is always good. I would highly recommend. I come to this place every week now."}
{"text":"I first tried this place a year ago and remembering having a much better time then... but unfortunately didn't remember what I ordered!   This time was hit and miss. I had the pan fried pork buns, which were well fried but so so dry on the inside (compared to the usual saucy filling). The spicy marriage cold dish was delicious, with ample cilantro which I love. I also liked the beef pancake rolls, but it tasted similar to other restaurants so wasn't that big of a stand out. The braised beef noodles was my least favourite - it looked good in other people's pictures but my order came with only tendon-y/skin portions, which was awful. It's too bad because the noodles and broth were good."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????d?????????????????????????????????????????????????????ok,????????????????"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My boyfriend and I always go and order 2 orders of dumplings as a late night snack. I would definitely recommend the lamb and carrot steamed dumplings"}
{"text":"Trying to find out the best dumplings in TORONTO, the YELP app and reviews kept pointing to the KING of KINGS for dumplings...aka The Dumpling King.  Little did I know this place existed in my backyard....literally a 5-10 min drive from the house.   Upon walking in the place was very spacious, clean, with a nice overal layout of the restaurant.  If you look towards the back you can see the actual work station where the workers actually make the dumplings fresh.  For the works, we ordered their steamed and boiled dumplings; pork & leek, pork & celery, pork & lamb, and their pan fried dumplings.  Thankfully with the Yelp mobile app I was also able to try their popular smoked duck, we opted for the half order $14.99 considering we had to still eat through the orders of dumplings that would soon arrive lol.  The average price for each dumpling order was approximately $6.49- $6.99.  Their size and portions were sufficient.  We had absolutely nothing negative about this place, it served our dumpling cravings and made our tummies full of joy.   now I've got a few local dumpling dives to choose from in the area....Dumpling king...thank you!"}
{"text":"came here probably over a year ago and never came back, should've known there was a reason. we came again last week for lunch, there was a group of 7 ... this lunch lasted 2 hours. mind you, we know better than to expect service here but the food was SO staggered, so SLOW. there was basically 1 server for the entire restaurant who just did not care to ensure our food was served.  we had dumplings and fried rice, one friend had the duck. the food is good, nothing life changing or memorable but it does satisfy your dumps cravings.   on our way out we placed 1 order for the pan fried dumplings to go, they neglected to give it to us before we left. when i called back to inform them that they had not given me the take out, he said it was my fault. no. it was not my responsibility to ensure the food was out in time. and we had given them at least 15-20 minutes before we got the bill.  i had to drive back after work to get my $10 not that it was worth the drive, i just refuse to let them have it. needless to say, don't come here if you don't have hours to waste."}
{"text":"Got so sick after eating here. Not worth it because the food wasn't even that good. I was literally wondering if their food was going to make me sick as I was eating it. It just came out way too fast. Got the chicken and mushroom and the pork and leek dumplings boiled and they were pretty tasteless and watery. The fried ones were super greasy. The hot and sour soup and jelly fish salad were decent but nothing to rave about. Even if it were good, nothing is worse than getting stomach problems the entire evening and the next day. Never again!"}
{"text":"long story short, to really like this place, you just need to know whats good and whats not and avoid the ones that are not . some items on the menu are drool worthy . my favorites ! some others ... are just the opposite .   my bf lives near by AND its cheap (w big portions!) so we're here pretty often . i always tend to order same things, in rotation . here are my favorites .  -  FRIED RICE WITH STEWED PORK & EGG . seriously . you NEED to try this . its like my favorite fried rice in the world . its not like your regular fried rice . it comes in a wooden bucket, covered in tin foil as if its been steamed (i think it is ?) with shredded lettuce on top . its so flavorful & moist and the crunchiness of the lettuce complements the rice perfectly . consistent EVERYtime . i promise you wont be regretting it . BEST thing my bf ever picked . EVER !  - SOUP FILLED DUMPLINGS . soup filled dumplings are my fav dumplings ever . they do it well here . not quite ding tai fung but just as good as asian legend's . its on the menu as steamed mini pork dumplings under dimsum section . i dunno about anyone else, but i wouldve never known that these are soup filled dumplings . they should make it clear so ppl like me dont miss out !!  - JULIENNE CUCUMBERS W VERMICELLI SHEETS . if you want to satisfy your foodie tastebuds w a taste out of your comfort zone, get this . i THINK this kind of taste like a korean dish ive had before but i cant really figure out what . AND i dont know why this is called what its called . it makes it sounds like cucumber is the main ingredient . instead, it should emphasize on its liquidity vinegary soy sauce w the peanut sauce . you mix it up all together and party in yo mouth ! its a pretty bold flavor so its perfect for foodie tastebuds !  - BRAISED BEEF NOODLE SOUP . sometimes when i wake up, i have an uncomfortable feeling in my stomache as if i had a glass of coke as soon as i woke up . thats when brunch just dont cut it . i need something warm and liquidy like congee or .. beef noodle soup ! they do it sooo well here; SOO much beef, HUGE portion, even bigger flavor . i hate me bland beef noodle soup . it tastes like it would be from a thick, dense saucey soup, but its not . its liquidy, light, drinkable soup . Ahhmazing .  P.S im pretty impressed by their website . this is a small mainland chinese restaurant . its not often a small chinese place has a website w its menu online !  P.P.S they ALWAYS have just for laugh on tv on rotation . weird . but good weird ."}
{"text":"Good fresh hot food. Great flavour. Lots of variety. Will be back for sure to try other stuff"}
{"text":"The pork and chives dumplings were nice though the wrap is slightly too thick for my preference. I love the pumpkin pancake and the fish in spicy oil, the portion was huge even for a small one. Overall the food quality is good"}
{"text":"My first visit to here, not disappointed. Dumplings is very good and flavorful. Braised beef with green onion yammmmy, has nice texture and some smoky flavor, very nice! Highly recommend it. Hot and sour soup has very good balance with hotness, sour and salt. We ordered pork and shrimp, pork and mushrooms dumplings, steamed mini dumplings, steamed pork buns, chicken and mushrooms pot stickers, sticky rice roll, braised beef with green onion, sliced pork hock in sauce and hot and sour soup for 2 of us . Only some soup left and we take it home. Bill was for 76$ included tax. Nice small restaurant. Probably not my last visit."}
{"text":"We've been here many times for lunch, and it's a solid choice for some classic northeastern Chinese food. During our most recent visit, we ordered three types of dumplings as well as a hot pot with vermicelli, meat balls, and bok choy. A must for a chilly day.  Surprisingly it wasn't too busy around 12PM on a Sunday, and we were seated immediately. This plaza does get pretty busy parking wise, but we were lucky enough to find a spot across the restaurant. Overall great quality."}
{"text":"I know this place is known for their dumplings but.. I would drive here just for their eggplant dish! Imagine made to order, fresh piping hot fried eggplant, topped with minced pork sauce and garlic on a sizzling plate all while maintaining the crispness of the eggplant!   Other notables are the lamb dumplings and any of their dumplings for that matter. The dumplings are home made as you often times see them wrapping it up fresh while you dine!   Definitely recommend. -1 star because we came here at 10:00pm one night, they said they were closed but the sign stated 11:00pm, as well service isn't very friendly."}
{"text":"Definitely not worth the 4 star rating it has. The crispy pork was hard to bite and not crispy at all, the beef noodle soup lacked flavour and the service was poor. Every meat entree was also extremely overpriced compared to other dumpling restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"I'm going to stick to 3.5 stars for now. We had the pork and cabbage potstickers and the vegetable dumplings (with mushrooms, greens and glass noodles). The pork potstickers were definitely the highlight. Seared with just the right amount of crunch on the bottom with a nice soupiness inside. They definitely know their potstickers' worth too - for the same price as the set of 12 veggie dumplings, you only get 5 potstickers.  Nothing much to say about the veggie dumplings - they were only mediocre :( This was what made it 3.5 stars rather than 4.  I'd definitely go back for their pork potstickers though and try the lamb that everyone seems to be raving about."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! I recommend getting the cold noodles in sesame sauce, and the dumplings are only $6-7 for 12. This is my new favourite dumpling restaurant."}
{"text":"The dumplings were ok tasting. We ordered pork & leek steamed, lamb, and the chicken mushroom.  They were all pretty underwhelming for a place claiming to be dumpling King. I've had better dumplings at humbler sounding dumpling restaurants.   I would've liked to have cilantro in the lamb to balance out the lambiness. The pork and leek ones were somewhat bland. I think the chicken mushroom was the best one out of the three.   Perhaps a little disconcerting is that the girl rolling the dumpling wrappers at the back was not wearing a hair net.   Verdict: been here before but it seemed to have tasted better then. Might try some other dumpling places to see how they compare!"}
{"text":"Let's just say that DK is not the cleanest looking place or the most comfortable.  But for a quick simple meal of dumplings and tasty northern Chinese dishes, it's right on!    We ordered various dumpling dishes, a casserole, cold appetizers and stir-fried dishes and they were all good.  I am not used to writing reviews where I say everything was good but with DK's food, it really is true.    All the dumplings, both pan-fried and steamed, were supremely juicy.  Compared to other dumplings and xiao long baos, DK's dumpling skin is thicker which I didn't particularly like.  Other than that, all the other dishes were perfectly seasoned, not too salty or too bland.  We tried a very refreshing vermicelli sheet with cucumbers (cold dish seasoned with tangy soy, sesame paste sauce), meatball casserole with bai-chai and a stir fried lamb with onion dish.    It really felt like I was eating at my mom's since all the flavours and seasoning were so perfectly suited for my palate.  I can't wait to go back to DK to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"By far my favourite place to go for good, cheap dumplings!  The restaurant itself is tucked into an Asian plaza, with a bland interior (in fact, it's not much more than tables, chairs and a TV constantly running 'Just for Laughs gags'). Like most Asian restaurants, don't come here expecting service, or you'll be sorely disappointed.  But the dumplings will be worth your while. I've had most of the dumplings on the menu, both steamed and fried, and have never been disappointed. A typical visit for my family will include two orders of dumplings (varies with each visit), their Xiao Long Bao (soup-filled dumplings), the rice that comes in a bucket (D15--I order it so frequently, I only know it by #) or their brisket noodle soup (D1)--ALL good choices!"}
{"text":"i honestly usually dont like dumplings, but this place, OMG, i would eat their dumplings everyday. theyre made fresh everyday and every dish is awesome. i especially love their braised brisket noodles and siu long bao, i come here so often with my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Very tasty !! Stopped in on a Saturday evening for take out. We didn't call ahead of time but didn't have to wait long for our order. Tried the leek and pork dumpling and pan fried pork and cabbage dumpling as well as the fried rice with pork. Dumplings were great and the fried rice was especially good. Would return !"}
{"text":"Honestly, after trying two different types of dumplings, and the pork belly appetizer, and pan fried buns, all I can say is, it was OK. A bit better then frozen stuff you cook at home, but no where close to being a good dumpling restaurant. The ONLY standout dish was the tofu. The braised tofu was a 5/5 and I'm not even a fan of tofu much. Pan fried bun was a 1/5. It was barely pan fried, too much skin, very little meat, flavour was boring, honestly just sad. Dumplings were 3/5. I don't know, maybe I'm just spoiled. My mama makes homemade dumplings all the time. Plus I've eaten a good share of dumplings in my life. It doesn't have to be fancy to be good but it does have to have the right ratio of skin to filling and it had to taste fresh and the dumpling has to be cooked just right. No soggy skins or dry skins will do!"}
{"text":"Mmm yum!  Dumplings galore!  Their dumplings and potstickers are definitely a hit.  I do agree that their other dishes aren't that great - we had some cucumber \"fun pei\" dish that was really poorly executed.  But everything else has been fantastic!  The general tao's chicken is also delicious.   Being a durian fan, I tried their fried durian dessert, which I was a bit disappointed with.  But hey...I'm at a dumpling place and like Jennifer K has already mentioned, why stray from that path?!   Definitely go there for their dumplings - favourites: lamb dumplings and also the pork & shrimp ones.  Both steamed!"}
{"text":"Something about the cheap prices here enticed us to order two dishes each. It ended up being so much food that we had enough leftover for a midnight snack at the hotel and lunch the next day!  I ordered the tomato egg noodles, an enormous portion for only $6. It was on the salty side, but I loved the heartiness of the sauce and the large amount of egg. The noodles were just great; pretty sure they were homemade. I also ordered a hot soy milk which was alright.  We came here for the dumplings, though, and sadly I didn't have as great of an experience there. I ordered the bok choy dumplings. They had tiny cubes of tofu inside them, which is cool. But they weren't flavorful--they had almost a grassy taste that needed a lot of soy sauce to balance it out. So sad! I'd try the vegetable dumplings next time, if I'm ever back in the area. My partner enjoyed his mushu and chicken dumplings."}
{"text":"The food is very good once we got it but the service was really slow.  It took them more than 30 minutes for 2 items that we ordered.    If the service was faster, I would have given a 4."}
{"text":"service was reallly bad... we waited half an hour for the waitress to bring us water... the food takes forever to come. We have to get up and leave..."}
{"text":"We Ordered the following: Chicken & Mushroom Dumplings, Leek, Shrimp & pork dumplings, pan fried pork dumplings, spicy minced noodle and vegetable soup.   Everything tasted really good!!! The noodle was ok, not in a bad way but in a comparison to the other dishes kinda way... Surprisingly we really enjoyed the vege soup (Seriously it is better than most Chinese restaurants plus big portion.) and the dumplings were tasty, \"juicy\" and they had a good ratio of stuffing and dough/wrap.  Service was good too.   We will definitely visit again. Wish I had order extra dumplings to go!   In short, we ordered 5 (yummy and big portioned) dishes for $40 and had left overs to go!  \"Tasty! Good portion! Cheap! Good Eats!\""}
{"text":"The food was alright. I ordered the pan fried pork dumplings and the mini soup dumplings. They were a bit on the greasy side. I also tried the beef pancake wrap, and that too, was a tad bit too greasy for my liking.   There were only 2 staff members waiting tables..in an almost full house.  Overall 2.5/5..."}
{"text":"Had pretty high expectations reading the reviews before coming to this place....parking is kind of hard to find in this dingy plaza..  This place is a a lot of variety in terms of steamed dumpling which I think we should have got but instead we got the fried ones, onion pancake and the minced meat fried rice in a wooden pot where I should have NEVER ordered!!!!!! It taste like fried rice from a Manchu wok, not saying it's bad but it's not authentic fried rice, it's more like chinese canadian fried rice, just total crap and overpriced, all looks but lacking the quality I was quite disappointed with the food overall, there r so many other good dumpling places in scarborough"}
{"text":"Came here based on past reviews.  I guess because of this my expectations were high.  Stick with the dumplings.  Anything else and you're on your own.  Pros: Good dumplings that are made fresh Lots of room inside Lots of noodles when you order them  Cons: When it's busy, expect to wait a bit If you don't get dumplings, you're on you're own  I do like this place honestly.  Just a couple of things that kept me from rating it higher.  Came on a weekend afternoon.  The place looks small from the outside but when you go inside, it's actually got a lot more seating than you expect.  We got lucky that there was a table free right when we got in.  Every other table was occupied.  Since it's called Dumpling King of course we ordered dumplings.  We got a boiled pork and fennel dumplings and a steamed leek, shrimp and pork dumpling.  2 bowls of beef noodle soup were ordered as well.  The dumplings were good.  There are workers in the back constantly making fresh dumplings right before your eyes.  They're not the best I've ever had, but they definitely hold their own.  The noodle was a bit of different story.  I'm a big fan of beef noodle soup so I'm much more finicky about it as well.  It was a decent bowl, just not as good as the better beef noodles out there.  The broth was OK, not spicy at all though.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the noodles themselves.  I like a firm noodle and they noodle they used was too soft for me.  The plus side is they give you TONS of noodles!!  Certainly the biggest portion of noodles I've ever gotten anywhere in the city.    When the place gets really busy, expect to wait a while.  They only have about 2 or 3 waitresses servicing about 20+ tables.  You're going to have to have patience when it's busy.  Nothing irks me more than seeing a table that sat down 15 minutes after us getting their food before us.  They got noodles too so it's not like ours takes longer to cook.  Oh well, first world problems again.  In the end, good place if you're craving dumplings.  Anything else and you could consider other options."}
{"text":"Ah, the taste of my fatherland!  Contrary to another dumpling place that I went to a coupla weeks ago, Dumpling King's menu is a bit more varied with different sections like 'Seafood', 'Pork', 'Chicken', etc.  Out of everything that was ordered, the Pancake (chives, egg, & shrimp) + Chicken/Mushroom Dumplings + Beef Brisket Noodles (~$6) were really good!  The cold, deep fried fish is not my thing and the Polenta w/ Sweet Potato Soup was extremely bland, so I wouldn't order those dishes again.  Contrary to some of the reviews, food arrived quite quickly!  Restaurant itself was really quiet on a Sunday afternoon.  Nice change of pace from the hectic Pac Mall area!  If you look towards the back of the restaurant, you can see a coupla older women actually making the dumplings.  Not 100% sure if the wrapping is store-bought or made in-house, but they had a nice, chewy texture.  ~$30 for 5 dishes, including my first ever check-in deal...15% off with Yelp check-in!"}
{"text":"Always find myself coming here for the same thing: Steamed Dumpling 5.99 for 15 pcs. and Beef Noodle Soup (5.99), and their 7.99 Hotpot Vermicelli special. Good value for the food. Also tried their Beef roll and Green onion pancake before which was actually quite good and very reasonably priced. Have yet to try other dishes but pretty happy with their food and service overall."}
{"text":"Location: This restaurant is located in the same plaza as Marathon Cafe, Snow Time, LaTea Era and CoCo. I went to this restaurant with my coworkers for a quick lunch on a random Wednesday. We got there before the lunch rush at 11:40am and thankfully there were only 2 other tables (~4-5 people per table). The interior is just like a typical Chinese dumpling place: a wall with a huge dragon, mirrors on the side walls, TV. Nothing too fancy.  We ordered a whole bunch of stuff to share amongst 5 hungry adults. 3 baskets of Shao Long Bao (with all the hot juices exploding!), 2 baskets of some random steamed long shaped dumplings (these were delicious!!), 2 plates of fried dumpling (not greasy but full of msg), a beef roll (delicious and would order it again!), a beef bowl noodle (this was alright, there's a kick to it and we didn't know so it might be good if someone likes spicy foods) and a really oily noodle dish (this was so oily that I didn't want to eat it because it felt gross). The server couldn't really speak English as he only nodded or just said yes and no. He refilled our water and tea and somewhat tried to accommodate us by giving us our food faster as we were in a hurry.   Not sure if I would come back again. The food was okay, but nothing really stood out to me. There are a lot of dumpling if not asian restaurants in Scarborough, so I might try other places first before coming back. From what we ordered, the price came out to be $15 per person...a bit expensive in my opinion."}
{"text":"Seems like the best dumplings in Toronto. Server has prompt service and food comes or fast, hot and yummy.   Lamb dumplings has fewer dumplings than the pork, however, it seems bigger and also very tasty. Non-dumpling dishes also taste wonderful. When you feel adventurous and after trying lot of their dumplings, I would recommend trying their other dishes. Such as the smoked duck meat.  They serve beers as well. Mostly Asian beers. Funny how they also serve this \"Old Beijing\" yogurt for 2.99. However, I have not tried it.  One thing they could do better is the interior design and the seating, where there is still room to improve comfortability."}
{"text":"Really really great dumplings!!!!! So happy I tried here, the dumpling skin is pretty thick which I like, and inside the meat is soft and flavorful & it has a good amount of soup inside! :)   The green onion pancake is also pretty well done, the fried dumplings aren't dry at all and were good as well!  But the biggest surprise was the pumpkin pancake for dessert!!! It was realllyyyy yummy. A thin slightly crunchy outside and a chewy soft sweet inside :) !! Definitely should try this dessert!   I'll take pictures next time :-D Also, they have a 15% off coupon for if you just check into their location!!! Really great!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant at least 10 times by now with my family and I must say the food here is as authentic as it can get for Chinese North-Eastern cuisine. The dishes served here are truly the kinds that I would find and taste back in my home town of Shenyang and we have not found a dish on their menu that disappoints. Their stewed hot pots are perfect for the winter. The seating here gets filled up so fast during dinner and lunch hours that I always see lines here despite there being plenty of other Chinese restaurants in this plaza. Do keep in mind that Chinese North-Eastern tend to be more salty than other parts of China, but you can request reduced salt when you order and I find most of the time the chefs do make reductions in the salt when you specifically ask to do so. I cannot say bad things about this restaurant as my family always circles back to this restaurant after trying to go to other restaurants for authentic Chinese food from our hometown. Only thing I can complain is the restaurant is so popular they need more seating and more waiting staff to accomodate all the customers lining up all the time!"}
{"text":"The sweet sour crispy pork is the truth, everytime I go there it is a must. The thin sliced pork that's breaded and coated in the sweet and sour sauce makes for a wonderful combination.   The dumplings are also juicy and full of flavour, if you're looking for dumplings this is the place."}
{"text":"Leek, pork and shrimp dumplings $6.99 Steamed mini pork dumpling $5.99 Fried leek and pork dumpling $5.99 Pork wonton soup $7.99  Get the first 3. Sooooooo goooood. Especially the steamed pork dumplings because it has soup in it (beware you will burn yourself). Wonton was meh, didn't have much taste so add soy sauce as needed.   Everything is made from scratch which is not as quick as a typical dimsum place but so worth the wait.   Get that fix!"}
{"text":"Good food. Service on the other hand is a whole different story. Came here with a group of 4. We ordered and we sat there for 45 minutes. We thought it was strange that other tables who came after us got their food first. We finished our tea and still didn't get food.  I asked the server how much longer it would take for our order to come. They told us that they lost our order. We ordered again and it took 25 minutes for our order to come. They avoided our table for the rest of our time there. It was obvious that we weren't very impressed. When it came down to the bill, they put service charge on it. I saw that other bills were not charged an additional service charge.  Thanks for not sincerely apologizing to us. As someone who was a server for 5 years, I am disgusted at my dining experience here."}
{"text":"Will never come here again! Although we came here like 4ish and there were only two tables including us, the service was super shitty that the staffs were sitting at the back and chitchatting the whole time. Even the only waitress they had there, it took her forever to come around our table to take order and bring food to our table. Their dumplings were just average either, nothing attractive for me to come here again other than they have really cheap steamed dumplings."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with dumplings! The restaurant is afterall called Dumpling King. The braised beef pancake wrap is so tasty! Be ready to put your taste palate to the test as some food is very spicy.  The hot & sour soup is also yummy, not too starchy, spiciness gives you a kick and good portion size.   Dumplings a must try! Why? Cause it's made in - house from scratch."}
{"text":"i looooooove dumplings. especially pan fried dumplings. though i do enjoy steamed dumplings too.  the dumplings satisfied my dumpling craving, but didn't amaze me. my favourite dumpling joint close down lol so i need to find myself a go to dumpling shop. this is not the one for me. maybe for you, but not for me."}
{"text":"I have a friend who loves this place, and I love her, so it pains me to say that I don't love this place. I don't hate it either, though. It's pretty decent and the skin that they roll in-house for the dumplings is superb. The place is a dingy looking with dark lighting. The service is hardly worth mentioning as it hardly exists. They're not rude - just don't expect anything more than efficiency and pragmatism.  We had: - pan fried dumplings: okay - steamed dumplings: okay - leek pancake box: okay if you like crispy deep fried skin - beef pancake: good if you can bypass the lack of beef accompanying the pancake wrap. The beef pancake here is eaten like a peking duck wrap using a thick deep fried breading wrap...strange but tasty - pigs ears marinated with cucumbers: good  The food overall is not very salty and requires some soy/hot sauce to bring out the flavours. So if you are not a sodium lover, you might quite enjoy this place.  The above and a bottle of coke was approximate $45 after tax and tip. Fed three people adquately. Not too bad.  CASH and DEBIT only"}
{"text":"Delicious soup filled dumplings and jiaozhi dumplings. Unassuming place and delicious. Also the leek, egg pancake/dumpling thing was delicious too. Would definitely go back! =)"}
{"text":"Most of there items were a bit too salty. My family and I got lamb dumplings, noodles, veggie mixed in with fish and red bean sticky bun. The dumplings and the veggies were way too salty, but the other two dishes were pretty alright. The servers are nice and the environment is not that clean but it's bearable. Warning... NO WIFI :0"}
{"text":"Dumpling King is called the Dumpling King for a reason... I should have know!! Why did I order something else but the dumplings??  I was here for lunch around 12pm and this place seems to tailored to big tables.. because all the big tables were filled! There were basically 40 patrons and with 1 waitress serving us all! Now you know I would not get getting any services.. and I will be waiting a long long time for my food to arrive.  The waitress is really cheerful however she is really overwhelmed from being all by herself.   I order the Cold Noodle in Sweet and Soup Soup and the Braise Beef Pancake.   Waiting Waiting Waiting..  The Beef Pancake I found is just ok.. The wrappings is too thick and with hardly any beef or green onion. (I am comparing to the one that served at Asian Legends).  Waiting Waiting Waiting.. did they forget my order?  The Cold Noodle... hmmm bad! Some of the Noodles are still hard.. not fully cooked! The soup base is really bland. I prefer the one at Dumpling Village a lot more! Just please don't order it!  Why the charge on the real bill is more than what they said on the menu??   Cold Noodle Soup Menu $5.99 VS Actual $6.99 Brasie Beef Menu $4.49 VS Actual $5.29  Maybe they really need to update their menu and the information on their website? Or I just being a sucker??  No Lunch Specials!  Cash Only!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars.The steamed dumplings were fantastic! Best I have had in Toronto to date. Perfectly cooked, tender filling (we had the pork & leek). They were sealed properly, still had a nice broth inside, wrapper was tender with a nice chew to it. Perfect. I could eat a lot of these. I can't wait to try the other flavours!  The pot stickers also had a fabulous filling, however not the best \"fried\" dumpling as I would like more crunch.   We also ordered the smoked pork and pancakes... (B1) Pork was dry, pancakes oily... I've had worse, but I wouldn't order these again. However many other (chinese/asian) people were not ordering the dumplings, which leads me to think there are other tasty dishes... Just have to figure out what to/not to order.   My only other problem was the chili sauce on the table was dried out and had an off flavour.. I'm not sure if its a different type compared to other dumpling restaurants, or if it was just old (Does it even expire??) but our soy/vinegar/chili mix just didn't taste the same.  Decent prices; not overly cheap, but onpar with most places. Service was a bit slow but she was nice! Bonus for 10% off for Yelp. Tea was hot & delicious. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Will be ordering the mushroom and pork dumpling and braised beef again on my next visit! Parking is nuts during busy hours. I recommend calling in your order to save time."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and enjoyed the veggie dumplings and their eggplant dish with potato and green pepper.  Sooo yummy.  They have a good selection of dumplings to choose from."}
{"text":"Judging from the photos, some of you guys wrote a review on the wrong place. Dumpling King is located in the plaza with the fountain, while Dumpling Restaurant is located in the newest plaza. After realizing my mistake (because Dumpling King had better reviews), I walked to the correct plaza and entered the restaurant.  It was underwhelming, to say the least. The decor was like a typical small Chinese restaurant, and prices reflected that. I ordered the lamb dumplings and beef noodles which I shared with two friends (this was pretty late at night, so we weren't really there to have a proper dinner).  The lamb dumplings were pretty good. They came in a plate of 12 and were juicy, but I've had better elsewhere. The beef noodles is where I'm conflicted. The noodles were chewy, and the meat was okay, but the broth was super oily. The picture I'm about to post probably doesn't reflect that, but to the naked eye you could see the separation of oil and everything else. My friend reported that if she were to be eating alone, she wouldn't have ordered it due to how greasy it was.  Service was a little below average. I think we arrived around 10, so it wasn't very busy (mind you, this was a Wednesday night). A waitress seated us, gave us menus, and then went back to the counter. We tried flagging her down a couple of times, but she never came to check up on us on her own (and only noticed we were trying to get her attention after like five minutes). As we got closer to the restaurant's closing time (which is 11), I could tell she was getting anxious about getting everyone to leave. I think she turned off the open sign around 10:30 right as a couple walked in. They left because she said they would have to eat within 30 minutes if they wanted to dine in. She didn't give my group any problems though, so despite being a little inattentive, she was an okay waitress.   I really wish I could say this place deserved the rating it has, but to be honest, I don't think it does. There are much better places elsewhere, and as someone who truly loves dumplings, I can't recommend Dumpling King. I will likely not be returning."}
{"text":"I came here based on the good review. I liked that the dumplings which had very minimum msg compare to other chinese restaurants. The dumpling portions were generous and the price is cheap. However, we ordered the lamb dumplings and the pork dumplings with leek. They taste about the same.  Overall, it is a decent choice if you feel like eating dumplings but don`t want to eat too much msg."}
{"text":"Dumpling King has been in existence since as long as I can remember. It's only a 5 minute drive from my house, yet oddly enough, I've never been here before despite my love for dumplings.   We started with 12 boiled leek and pork dumplings. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of boiled dumplings because soggy dumpling skin doesn't appeal to me. For that reason, I much prefer steamed dumplings. Although the dumpling was well-packed and the filling was quite tasty, I didn't enjoy the the thick dumpling skin.   Next up, pan fried pancakes with chives is another favourite to order. This one came oddly shaped. The pancake is slightly too thick for my liking, but it's filled with delicious, aromatic chives.  We also ordered some home style pork and cabbage dumplings which were pan fried. Again, the filling was tasty, and I preferred these over the boiled ones because the dumpling skin was not soggy. For some reason, however, I still love potstickers more, because I think potstickers have a higher filling-to-dough ratio.   Although the meal was already very carb heavy, it didn't deter me from ordering more carbs for dessert! My pick was pan fried red bean pancake, and I really enjoyed this version. The crispy pancakes were extremely thin, and as a result, the flavours of the red bean paste in the center really stood out. It was a delicious dessert to end the meal.   All in all, I still prefer Dumpling Village (at Brimley and Sheppard) to Dumpling King, as their dumpling skins are a lot thinner. But at least this restaurant is a lot closer to where I live."}
{"text":"For a small dumpling restaurant this place was better than expected. First impression this place was going to be small because of the plaza that it is in and parking could be difficult. The setting was like an older or classic Chinese restaurant but you see the openness of the dumpling makers at the back making them, no wall separation. The dishes seems a little dirty or some of them were wet, so you might need a quick wipe before using them. The service was average, not that great if you don't speak Mandarin.  But we are here for the food. Got two orders of steam dumpling, beef pancake, and the fried rice with stewed pork and eggs. The dumplings were nicely made and decent quantity for the price. Inside was filled with soup and taste alright. The beef pancake tasted great compared to some of the places I have been to but it was a little oily and lacking some veggies in it. The fried rice looks simple but surprisingly it tasted really good, however it looks more like thinly sliced BBQ pork rather than stewed pork. The rice also seems a little on the oily side but did not feel heavy.   Overall impression was good and worth trying again, just wished it was less oily."}
{"text":"My first time back here in a while, I used to go quite often. As usual dumplings are good and fresh. The price is excellent, about $40 for two people and we definitely ordered enough food for 3. We even took leftovers home.   Will be back."}
{"text":"Looking at the menu, most of the dumplings come in plates of 12. A good plan would be to come with more people to share all the dumplings. Went as a group of four, ordered six dishes and cleared it all. Everyone was just full but still had room for dessert.  The cool tofu appetizer was simple but paired with the preserved eggs, peanuts and sauce it was just right. The pork belly didn't have enough garlic so the flavour wasn't strong enough. Wanted to try more than just dumplings so only ordered one plate of crispy pan fried dumplings. It was served all stuck together by the crispy bottom which made for an interesting presentation. Took a bite of the dumpling and a lot of juice shot out, it was a dangerous dish but the meat juice and meat was delicious. The mini dumplings on the other hand was not as good, the skin was too thick and the inside lacked the juice expected in xiao long baos. The two pancake dim sums were good.  Overall, will definitely come back for lunch and dinner. Conveniently close to home is a bonus."}
