{"text":"This place is clean and renovated and a nice addition to Parkdale. The lunch specials are pretty good value--under 10 bucks and you get more food than you can comfortably eat. I've had the chilli chicken and Kung pow chicken on different occasions, both of which were of average quality. The best thing is never having to wait for a table and the staff is friendly. That's gotta be worth something."}
{"text":"I give it  5 stars because its very clean, service is very friendly and moderately fast. The food is a 4, its  good. Lots of space to relax. I'd say it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Clean, welcoming, quick. Very large portions as well. I ordered the corn soup from the appetizer menu and expected a small bowl. It was massive, and almost a full lunch meal by itself! I barely ate any of the sweet n sour chicken I also ordered, but enjoyed that the next day as leftovers. Only change I would make to the chicken would be to add more veggies to the dish."}
{"text":"I do NOT recommend this place nor will I ever order from them again. I was feeling Asian cuisine so my boyfriend and I decided to order dinner from Cube. Safe to say everything went straight into the garbage untouched. The chicken balls were super dry and had no flavour, the chilli chicken was so extremely salty that we felt dehydrated for hours after trying it and the chicken fried rice was so bland it felt like i was eating cardboard. We called to complain and were asked to leave our phone number so the manager can call us back. We are still waiting for his call. Complete disappointment, complete waste of my money, and completely shitty customer service."}
{"text":"I'll give this a star for the modern and clean presentation of the restaurant. a reasonable menu option for the parkdale area. Props for renovating the space.  The first time I had this dish, was because I was told it was the dish to measure how good the asian  kitchen was. So I must say, its a habit I have maintained that throughout my travels and cities I have lived in. From hole-in-the-walls to popular local mainstays in both the Canada and the US.   I have never come across, such a poor execution of this dish. The beef tasted old, off or if I can put it if this way marinated with shrimp (thats not a plus). Honestly, it smelled like beef that had that question in my mind when I have forgotten it in my fridge and started to turn a grey colour, 'Should I eat that?'  That terrible, rancid like flavour and smell has not left. I had someone else try it and feel the same. Very disappointing and still somewhat traumatised.  I had even asked the hostess if it was the type of noodle I asked for she said, yes but, that was not the case. Poor product knowledge. If she wasn't sure she should have asked.   If you want fried beef noodle, go further up the street go to Rice and Noodle, just a little further up the street. They have, maybe 2 tables, but that dish was executed so much better.  I was so disappointed because I had such high hopes for this place."}
