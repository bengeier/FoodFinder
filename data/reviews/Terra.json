{"text":"My two dining companions and I had a wonderful dinner tonight. The surroundings are pretty ordinary, but the food and service quite inspired. The Lamb Osso Bucco was as good as I've ever had, and the apple tart for dessert was just right for the three of us. The place was busy but the service was attentive and unrushed. It was expensive but our Living Social coupon made it pretty reasonable....about $40 apiece."}
{"text":"Decent food, it reminded us of wedding catering and the interior was pretty generic.  It's not terrible, but not really worth the price or trip."}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: Of the finest meals that I have ever had in Charlotte. I can't even bring myself to hold the broken cappuccino machine against them.

We were a party of four that included a meat lovers, a part-time vegetarian and someone who only eats chicken.... Not an easy crowd to please but every course, irrespective of what we ate, was perfection. Quality, flavor, portion size, service - superb.

Um, yes, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great first visit on a Wednesday night with my wife and 8 yr. old son.  They were not very busy, maybe 2 other tables.  The best part of the evening was the service.  We had 2 waitresses help us and they were both fantastic. Super friendly and very much on top of it all.  They were quick and not hiding.  Bravo to the girl from Indianapolis!  The food was great too. Had the duck pate and a bowl of cauliflower soup. Both delicious. I had a special of grouper filet on top of saute spinach. It was good, but not super fantastic. probably needed a bit more seasoning for my taste.  My wife had a bowl of mussels. They tasted good but had one problem: they were super miniature.  These things were the size of a dime at best and not the larger variety you find everywhere else. Will not order them again.  Overall, had a great experience and the service and good food were pleasing enough to warrant regular visits."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new place to try for our anniversary. My husband took to Yelp to see what area eateries were earning some high marks and he found Terra.  It's next to a Starbucks tucked away and it's very intimate--we liked that. I think perhaps the ambiance inside could use some warming up--that's the only reason I took off a star. It's not the most inviting place on the inside, but they use very clean linens (that's kind of a pet peeve of mine--I hate paper), so there are definitely points for that.

A very friendly gentleman greeted us at the door and seemed genuinely happy we were there. The service was the best I think we've had just about anywhere--before we even thought to ask for something, it was quickly in place (water, fresh napkins and knives, etc.). Our server was friendly, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu. They run a very tight ship--each course was served at the very moment when you began hoping for it to show up.

We had salad, apps, entrees, and dessert. I had the Caesar salad. It was slightly warmed with just the right number of anchovies. My husband loved the pear salad, as well. He had escargot (they are very hard to find anymore) and I had the fresh mozzarella and prosciutto. My husband at first thought there was a bit too much pesto on the escargot, but he said it was delicious. The prosciutto was the best I've had since leaving NY--paper think, just salty enough, and buttery.

For the entrees, I had the grouper on ravioli with what I think was a Pernod sauce and my husband had the scallops. The portions are not large but with so many courses, we didn't feel cheated. The grouper was a bit overcooked but still tender. The scallops were cooked to perfection and the ravioli must have had truffle or some other mushroom in the filling. They were absolutely incredible. For dessert, we shared a chocolate gelato sundae with fresh fruit and homemade whipped cream.

We put great stock in fine service and enjoy it when the staff and chef or owner appreciates that we enjoyed the meal. The same man who greeted us saw us out, shook our hands, and asked us to return. This is the kind of personal touch you want from a small, neighborhood restaurant. The food is simply prepared, fresh, and delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh, simply prepared food with an emphasis on local ingredients. Paired with friendly, professional service, Terra is a great place for both a special occasion or just a lovely evening out. Owner is often there and is incredibly kind and generous. Great wine selection also."}
{"text":"Incredibly poor customer service. Made a reservation 3-4 months ahead of time for Valentine's Day. Called about a month later to confirm the reservation. Confirmed. No issues. Called February 10 again to confirm. No reservation. Wait, what now? Apparently our reservation had been lost. At this point every restaurant worth going to is full so it's too late to get an alternate reservation.

When I was finally able to get in touch with the management (after 3 phone calls and 1 email) I was told that they were sorry, but there was nothing they could do. I was also told that \"several other people\" had called with this same issue. No attempt was made to reconcile the situation. Not squeezing us in that night, not even such a small gesture as a complimentary app should we choose to come another night. A heartfelt apology wasn't even issued. It was literally the words, \"Sorry, there's nothing I can do.\"

At this point I was frustrated. I asked what the gentleman's name was and for his position at the restaurant. \"Why?\" he asked. I told him I wanted to speak with his superior. He answered, \"I am the superior. I'm the owner,\" (still no name given). I asked if he had ever run a restaurant before (in a calm and non-confrontational manner). He literally said, \"That's none of your business.\" Not, \"I'd prefer not to give out that information,\" nor, \"I'm sorry, but I would prefer not to say.\" No. \"That's none of your business.\" 

And so I asked if his restaurant was in the habit of not making amends when they messed up and ruined people's plans. Admittedly, I did sound snarky, but I wasn't being belligerent. He said, \"It's your word against mine.\" That is verbatim, folks. \"It's your word against mine.\" I laughed (because if I didn't I would shout), and wished him, \"Good luck.\" He replied, \"Good luck,\" as well and hung up.

Unfortunately, he's not wrong. He has no incentive whatsoever to make this situation right. It IS my word against his. However, if I EVER spoke to a guest in such a disrespectful manner at the hotel where I used to work I would be fired faster than I could blink. I'm astounded by the lack of customer service knowledge displayed by this owner (if he was indeed the owner; remember, no name was given). 

Its my word against his. I can only hope that the word of a potential customer is worth more to you, reader, than it was to Terra. 

EDIT: Perhaps it would be beneficial for this restaurant to not only take reservations over the phone as their website says. Then there would at least be some sort of record so that problems could be more effectively addressed."}
{"text":"I have been here for a girls night a few times.  I try to make sure I come on Tuesdays because there is all you can eat mussels.  That is right!  The mussels are great and they allow you to change sauces between rounds.  Definately worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Terra and was impressed with the service.  The owner was very cordial and the wait staff went out of their way to make us comfortable.  The lamb shank was really good and was reasonably priced.  The restaurant is fairly small so it may be best to go back when its not a holiday."}
{"text":"(4.1) - An initmate little French (and some Italian) locale tucked away next to a Starbuck's off Providence road in Charlotte, quite authentic with a French owner. The wine list was well curated..we found a nice Loire Valley Cabernet Franc (unbeatable at that price point), and also finished off the meal with a lovely Sauternes. The black grouper (caught fresh from the Atlantic) was the star of the show. The duck confit was good, but the leg was a little on the small side and the brussel sprouts paired with it were not really a match made \"au Paradis\" - that was the only blemish. The apple tart dessert was delivered warm and delectably delightful."}
{"text":"Small, easy to host a large group. Not noisy so easy to have a conversation. The food and wine were very good. Only minus is that it shares a parking lot and it fills up quickly."}
{"text":"Heard they closed!  Definitely a loss for charlotte. Impeccable service and food. I wish we had a chance for another glass of wine at the bar. Thanks for all the great memories."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I bought a groupon for Terra a few months ago and made reservations last night to try it out. Our experience was phenomenal. The service was amazing, the food was incredible, and the wine was delicious. We had the meat and cheese plate for an appetizer, and it was the best meat and cheese plate I've ever had (better than nobles). The entrees were fantastic. The risotto du jour (with shrimp and mussels) and the gnocchi with sausage blew my mind. We had chocolate mousse for dessert that was better than any chocolate mousse I've had. I highly recommend trying this restaurant. It's definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"How am I the first to review this!! I like Terra a lot I haven't been in a while and I was just thinking about it and thought to see what Y'all thought about it, but apparently nobody has thought about it at all!! 

OK well since I am the first I will start by saying you definitely need reservations. This place is very tiny and if any of you have been here when it was Volare?? (I think that was the name) you know just how small it is. 

Theirry is a Frenchman and has worked in restaurant's in Charlotte for like 20 years. He is very warm and welcoming he is always wearing a vest and his hair pulled back in a pony tail!! Love him he just fits the look perfectly!! 

The food is very good! I love their Grilled Caesar salad and French Onion soup, Oh and their Beef Carpaccio if they have it!!  They have a mix between French, Italian, and Spanish on the menu so I think that's what makes it so unique and with great flavors!  they have a good wine selection and Sweets too!! 

If you haven't been I think you should try it at least once! They have a great staff and they are very helpful!!"}
{"text":"We were privileged to have dinner here to celebrate an important milestone. The food was excellent, the service above average, and all at a great price thanks to a coupon from Living Social. We had the mussels+fries appetizer, both were excellent. Main courses were scallops with spinach ravioli, and veal scallopini. Everything was delicious; our server did a great job. The air conditioning was not working very well but it was otherwise a great evening."}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday, and off the top, I love a place that knows what they do right! I mean this place doesn't even open until 5pm! So dinner is all they serve... I looked at the menu a head of time cause I am a picky eater, I first ordered the Terra Cesar salad, I must say, the most amazing Cesar I have ever had!! I also order the NY strip streak, it was the biggest NY strip I have ever seen, and it was cooked perfect!! Medium rare how I love it! The service was amazing! My water never got more then half way! The only thing, this may just me being a nag but they have chef special daily which is great, but I wish the waiter would have remembered it or at least wrote it down cause he lost me when he was stumbling to remember the specials... But other then that it was great and the atmosphere was nice quiet and warm!"}
{"text":"I had driven past this place and never even knew it existed.  I had a great dinner.  They had a trigger fish special that was fantastic.  It was cooked perfectly.  I also had a Duck Pate to start that was also fantastic.  It's a little pricey but they made it worth it."}
{"text":"I should start with the disclaimer that we only got a drink here before a movie at Manor.  But wow did we talk about this place for days after!  We sat at the little bar in the front and talked to our waiter about movies and music and Charlotte.  We listened to the wait staff practice their french - many of whom are fluent.  The place is small and it feels like going to a rich family member's for dinner--everyone is friendly and talkative and it feels like home.  The atmosphere is romantic and from what we heard the food is phenomenal. 

The only downside I see to this place is the prices but the next time they have a Groupon I will be the first in line!"}
{"text":"Yes this place is beside a Starbucks in that crappy parking lot where no one can figure out where the out is. But, you should ride your bike to get there, or walk or skip. Actually, I recommend biking or skipping because Terra's food is rich and succulent and you will be glad for the exercise after. My dining  partner and I decided to share four appetizers to get the full Terra experience. Our meal began with complimentary bruschetta which was the freshest bruschetta I have ever tasted. I can not even put my finger on what made it so amazing but I wanted ten more. The bread was crusty and fairly standard. I had a great dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (sigh) and my dining partner was recommended a glass of wine which surprising was only $9 when the check came. Not bad for such a ritzy place. 

We split: Duo de Canard \"Traiteur\" - $12 Duck Pâté and smoked duck breast, served with a truffle honey emulsion. 

Very smoky and decadent. The smokey flavor of the duck breast was a bit much for me but he loved it. We also shared: 

    L'Assiette de Charcuterie et de Fromage - $18 Selection of meat and cheese plate

Large and varied- some soft, others semi-soft. Olives, pickles- etc.
    
Ravioles de Veau au Beurre de Truffe - $12 Homemade veal raviolis, served with a truffle cream sauce.

Dramatically increased my waistline. So rich. So creamy. So well done.

    Petites Merguez Grillees au Couscous Israelien, à la Menthe Fraiche - $12 Grilled lamb sausages served on bed of Israeli couscous with fresh mint

This wasn't my favorite but my friend cleaned this plate.

This was an ample amount for two people to share and be able to sample their unique menu.

What an amazing special occasion place. White glove/napkin service 5/5 there. or if you are well-off I would eat here weekly."}
{"text":"Dining here is a life experience. Thierry and his staff deliver outstanding personable service and quality food. I researched for an appropriate place to celebrate my Daughter's graduation and I kept coming back to Terra.  
The Menu is not extensive but the selections are impressive and diverse.
I started with the Escargots de Bourgogne, followed by the Lamb Osso Bucco and then finished with the Apple Tart topped with homemade ice cream. I complimented my meal with a nero d'avola. They have a good selection of by-the-glass wines. 
The Pan Seared Scallops over Risotto, the Duck Confit and Grilled Lamb Sausage were all equally delicious. We did a lot of sharing because it was all too good to keep to ourselves.
The waitstaff was available if we needed them, but did not interupt our meal and we were never rushed, which I appreciate.  Chef Owner Thierry Garconnet spent time greeting us and ensuring we were satisfied. He even came over to us as we were leaving to thank us. This type of personal service is rare and welcome.
I walked away feeling very good and very satisfied by our experience at Terra. I will definitely be back.
Interestingly, I noticed that as intimate as it is, the place was filled with regulars. The staff and owner seemed to know many of them by name. I think it says a lot about a place that has such a devoted following."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood gem with an intimate atmosphere. Everything we ordered was perfect and the specials were fantastic. The scallops were my favorite along with the mushroom fricassee side. The chef greeted us at the door and also checked on us after the meal; great guy with a passion for the food. Service matched the caliber of the food; very knowledgeable servers that have been at Terra for years

This is the place to impress your friends and family."}
{"text":"Good food. Average service. Based on other reviews my expectations were very high.... My wife and I had an 8pm reservation and were seated promptly. We sat for over 5 minutes before anyone offered us a drink, although the busser did come around filling waters. No cocktail list.  I just ordered my usual, a Manhattan. The duck pate was pretty solid, and we had the duck confit and the steak for dinner. Steak was perfect, but I was pretty disappointed in the duck portion size... 1 leg! What was odd was that our server kept trying to push wine on us for dinner. Being a French place, I get it, but when I say no thanks you don't need to ask 3 more times. Let me enjoy my liquor! We don't normally order dessert but it was a special occasion... I had the mousse and she had the parfait. Both were good.  Atmosphere was more \"place to bring my parents\" than \"place to bring my wife.\" Overall, the steak and the pate were excellent while the rest was satisfactory. That all adds up to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Went back recently for dinner. I've been a few times before and always wonder why I don't come more often.  Service is always great, the location and decor are intimate without feeling cramped and the food is excellent.  Feels like you are in a European Bistro.  Had the mussels and burrata to start --both always great.  Then I had the veal.  Everyone got something different and nobody was disappointed except I think everyone wanted what everyone else had-- good problem to have.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food that is worth the price. The Duo de Canard \"Traiteur\" is a great combination of Duck pâte and smoked duck breast, though I wish it had a touch more of the chili infused honey because it was so good. 

They change up their menu frequently so if your favorite disappears be sure to tell the owner so he'll bring it back! But the variety will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"Excellent. My wife and I went here a few months back and it was delicious. Nice cozy place, that's easy to miss if you're driving on providence. 

The seafood salad was quite nice. The lamb was outstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed the lamb. Lamb is something that I enjoy, but since moving to Charlotte I haven't gotten into the habit of ordering it here. But you can't go wrong with the lamb here. My wife ordered the mussels since she loves mussels and they did not disappoint there either. 

The service was top-notch. They were very attentive and very knowledgeable. It's a little pricey, but the quality of the food is up there as well. 

Overall I'd recommend this place for a date."}
{"text":"A little gem in hiding! It is tucked away in the corner beside starbucks and confusing little parking lot, dont try to pull into the panera one.  

Once inside, it was a cute little place, with great food. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped with wine choices. There were plenty of specials as well. I chose the mussels for starters and had the fish of the day. My SO had the terrine with salmon, mushrooms and duck and for dinner the lamb. All of our food came out promptly even though they were busy (full house). Mussels were perfectly cooked and so delicious. I could have just eaten that for dinner. I also cleaned my plate for the fish. I did try the lamb, I am not a lamb person but my SO said it was very good as well. I would recommend this place and certainly go back. I might have gained 5 pounds though.  yum!"}
{"text":"I visited Terra Saturday for dinner and overall I was  impressed though they still have some work to do to earn that 5th star. 

Food- 
A complementary seafood salad amuse-bouche started the meal off on a highpoint. It was light, fresh, and extremely tasty. Next we moved on to some  french bread which I found to be disappointingly dry though the olive oil and balsamic were high quality.  

The Ravioles de Veau au Beurre de Truffe (homemade veal ravioli with cream sauce) was outstanding! By far some of the best homemade pasta I have ever eaten, the flavors were both delicate and complex. I may purchase two of these as my meal next time! 

Our main course was the filet and  it  wasn't as memorable unfortunately. The filet had a reduction with cherries in it ( though it didn't mention this on the menu) but the flavor was too sweet for my taste. I opted for garlic mashed potatoes which were very creamy but lacked salt (coming from someone who is a known under-salter this says a lot). 

The dessert was the main reason for a non-five star review (since the ravioli absolutely earned 5 stars) we had salted caramel ice cream with puffed pastry and apples. It sounds mouthwatering but honestly the caramel was either burned or their was a liquor that wasn't cooked off...I couldn't even eat it though I will say my boyfriend did. 

Service was excellent - friendly and knowledgeable. 

 Wine list - only bottle prices are listed, if you drink by the glass you have no idea what you're going to end up with...which was my case. 

Atmosphere- As others have said it was a bit stark. They need to dim the lights, play some soft music (they were playing something you might find at Azteca) and perhaps make it a little more cozy. 

I will return for the ravioli because it was THAT good!"}
{"text":"Terra.  It's the restaurant you've seen 100 times while grabbing your latte from the Starbucks next door.  I dined here once several years ago, and could have sworn it was French/Italian fusion, but the menu last Friday night was French.  Don't be intimidated by this, as there is something that everyone will enjoy.  

After a day spent moving furniture, mattresses, etc. (the joys of moving), we had worked up a SERIOUS appetite.  To begin, we split the carpaccio du jour, which came with balsamic onions and gorgonzola.  I love onions of all shapes and sizes, but cooked in balsamic? Oh man, oh man.  Scrumptious.  

I ordered the duck confit as my entree, which comes served with a side of flageolet beans and sausage.  These are a thinner, more delicate looking kidney bean, and I absolutely adored them.  The duck was tender and very good, but sadly I preferred the duck confit at Rooster's a bit more.  I like a more salted, briny flavor. 

I sampled the fish of the day which was a poached halibut that was flavorful and ever so healthy.

The restaurant has a definite European feel to it.  It is elegant and relaxed at the same time.  I would love to enjoy some lovely wine and appetizers on the patio before catching a flick at the Manor.  Sounds heavenly right...about...now..."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place for a few years and had never paid them a visit.  As a matter of fact, I had met the owner at an event and really wanted to check it out. Was I ever impressed!  Besides the fact that the decor needs a touch of warmth, the food more than made up for those slight shortcomings.  I have found my newest spot for French food, something we all know is lacking here in Charlotte.  We shared escargot, mussels and a filet.  The escargot were garlic filled(always a plus), the mussels were steamed in a sauce worth dipping for days and the filet was super tender and the onion confit...AMAZING! The service was some of the best I have encountered here in Charlotte.  I can't wait to go back...wait, did I mention unlimited mussels on Monday for $19?  YOU KNOW i AM GOING FOR THAT!"}
{"text":"Our meal was fabulous!  From the escargot to the faux gras as starters, to our main courses of lobster over risotto and the duck confit, everything was prepared perfectly. We finished we a mixed berry parfait, light and tasty. The service was attentive and the personal engagement of owner/manager indicates how it all comes together. When he visited our table he knew everything we had ordered and asked about each dish. This was a great find for us. We will soon be regulars."}
{"text":"Stop reading and go.

If you insist on the details, we went here to avoid restaurant week. The reviews were outstanding, and I thought to myself \"no way it lives up to the hype\" but it did. Just well executed, classic French dishes. So rich, and so well flavored.

The only thing I would improve would be the atmosphere, it's just sort of \"blah.\" But with food like that, they can decorate however they want."}
{"text":"Food was very good but the way it is decorated is terrible for
a place that expensive. It was cold, bright lights in certain
areas.......the chairs were uncomfortable......."}
{"text":"This restaurant is phenomenal. The food was excellent. We had the mussels for an appetizer, I had the fish special with spinach and mushroom ravioli, and finished the an apple tart for dessert. It is a tiny restaurant and a little loud, but the food was top notch and so was the service."}
{"text":"Eat here!!!

So I've been to the bar a few times before tonight and the food is always first-class. The service is always great. I always want to come back.

We came to Terra tonight to avoid restaurant week and celebrate a birthday. We sat at the 4-top in the bar area. We were sooo looked after. Amazing service. The food was amazing - really amazing. Just the specials were unreal .....

Eat here!!"}
{"text":"When we arrived at Terra, we were warmly greeted by a  happy, smiling man.  Not sure if he was the owner, manager or chef, but it was as if he was welcoming us into his own home.  And what a lovely, cozy place it is.  The lighting was perfect, and French cafe music played in the background. 
Our server offered us samples of the wines by glass.  We settled on the montepulciano, which was a bit like a Cabernet Sauvignon.  We were given an amuse-bouche, which was a smoked fish spread on a crostini.  I don't typically eat fish, and It tasted a little fishy to me, so my husband devoured both of our servings.  We were served bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Very enjoyable, and the server spontaneously brought extra bread.
We both ordered the scallops served atop spinach and cheese ravioli.  The presentation was beautiful.  Rare for me to order seafood, but these scallops were perfectly seared and seasoned.  The ravioli needed a bit of salt.  I did note that this restaurant is not too proud to have  salt and pepper shakers on the table.  An appreciated touch.
The happy, smiling man who greeted us checked on us to see how we were enjoying our evening.  We were all smiles.  What a charming place."}
{"text":"I am so glad I was told about this place.  It does not get the \"hype\" it deserves but I am sure some of the regulars/locals are happy about that.  It had almost an old world feel inside.  I couldn't quite place the atmosphere....was it old school Charleston?  New Orleans?  Or Europe?  It was quaint, classy and intimate.  The people around me were in bow ties, suits and dresses.  Most of my fellow diners were 50 years old or older.  One of the prior reviews said it felt like going to a rich relatives home for dinner and that was very well stated...I agree.

The food was phenomenal.  You know when you are eating things that you normally wouldn't eat but you are really enjoying them that someone has done something extremely well!  That was my experience at Terra.  I was eating fish, veal raviolis, heirloom tomatoes, etc.  Everything I ate was absolutely unreal.  My husband and I absolutely CLEARED our plates.  I don't think we even left any residue.  The desserts we chose were the chocolate mousse and the salted carmel pastry puff...both were scrumptious.  Everything is just so well done.  The flavors are perfect but the quality of food was what truly impressed me.  Everything was fresh and the presentation was done to perfection.  

It was truly a culinary dream!  I would go back again and again.  It has a unique feel that I don't think I have seen anywhere else in Charlotte.  Hats off to chef and owner...well done!!!"}
{"text":"You might walk in, but there is a fair chance you will waddle out.  Full disclosure; I went to Terra because a wonderful friend of mine had a gift card.  However, I would go again and pay every cent of the rather high prices.  We could possibly attribute this to my goldfish memory, but this is the best restaurant I have been to in Charlotte.

Let's start with the atmosphere   The place is small and very unassuming from the outside, being tucked in next to a Starbucks in what just seems like a strange place for such a nice restaurant.  Or the perfect place for the best kept culinary secret in Charlotte.  The decor inside is simple, clean, understated and elegant.  Lots of nicely finished wood and white tablecloths galore.  Make sure that you keep an eye out for the gaudily framed picture of a steak, though.  Altogether the atmosphere is unassuming but pleasant, with some subtle touches that I really like.  Let's attribute my mixed feelings about it to my lack of culture.

Anyway, the food.  Wow, the food.  We ordered duck pate, the meat and cheese plate, lamb sausage with cous cous, and the richest ravioli this side of the pearly gates.  It was all amazing.  I could rank them from best to worst, but that would be silly.  The \"worst\" is easily on par with anything else I have had in Charlotte (and I make full use of restaurant week).  Everything-the plating, the timing, the flavors.

I almost forgot, don't forget your glass of wine.  I am no connoisseur but the selection of wine and mixed drinks was fine, if a little steeply priced.  Our server had a personality straight out of Office Space, but did a great job so I shouldn't be mean.

I guess my point is, eat here. You won't be disappointed.  Have I ever steered you wrong? What? You don't even know me? Whatever, just trust me.  Do it.  Shoo! Go make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes but our experience didn't match other reviewers. One in our party ordered the Osso Buco which was tough and chewy instead of the expected fall-off-the-bone tender. To the management's credit, the bad dish was taken away and a different entree was offered. Neither appeared on the bill. 

Alas, the replacement dish (Veal Saltimbocca) was rather tasteless and one of the two pieces of veal was raw in the center. We guessed that the meat was frozen and, in the rush to get the replacement out, wasn't cooked properly.

The Duck Confit was overcooked, but the flavor was excellent.  The fish was well cooked but the dish was under-seasoned and bland. 

Service was excellent. The first bad plate was handled gracefully and with class. We didn't mention the quality of the replacement. 

Overall, we wouldn't be in a hurry to go back to Terra."}
