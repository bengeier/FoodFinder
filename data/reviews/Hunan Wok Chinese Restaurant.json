{"text":"Been coming here for years. Best fried dumplings, egg foo young, & crab rangoons. However, getting a low score due to no delivery. I have to take the bus and this place is very inconvenient to get to due to route cuts."}
{"text":"Let's look past the fact that it's not an ambient, authentic Chinese atmosphere, let's look at the value, and the flavor, and the fact that there's not much if any competition in the area...

Value is great, they offer several free items if you purchase certain dollar amounts of food. And you get a lot of food for the price you pay!

The flavor was great! I had General Tso's, my wife had Chicken Fried Rice, and my son had Sweet & Sour chicken... no complaints, we all enjoyed it, and even had leftovers!

You can eat there... but it's what I call 'Quick Service' or 'Counter Style', order at the counter, and you sit down. No one will be waiting on you... refilling your ice water every five minutes. This isn't a deal breaker. Besides, you get your food in about 10-15 minutes and it's hot, and delicious!

Competition... there honestly isn't any. The next closest place by comparison is either China Buffet in Century Square, or P.F. Changs. And I don't want buffet, and I don't want to pay an arm and a leg for some simple Chinese food. Further out it's either Silk Road, Sesame Inn, or China Town Inn... and it will take you forever to get to those places than you care to endure.

{"text":"I have been looking for 3 years for good crab rangoon - I finally found it!!!  We had boneless ribs that were absolutely wonderful.  Definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for years (since it opened). Never had a problem until recently you would get your money's worth. For a 4.95 lunch special you would get some sort of meat,fried rice,soup, and an egg roll. Now the same lunch is over 5.00  meal is alot smaller, and no soup. When I first went there there was people there and  3 cooks. Now I'm the only one there and only 1 employee running the register and cooking at the same time. The restaurant is dirty and looks like it hasn't been clean in a very long time."}
{"text":"Love this place. Run by family. Best General Tso's around. And when I walk in they call me Mr. Spicy!"}
{"text":"Ok this is my first yelp review, I never left any reviews for other restaurants, but I am writing it because I want others to know about this place more.

Restaurant run by family. very friendly, clean cooking environment, and Great food. I would come to this place again and again whenever I visit Pittsburgh.

Its less than 10min drive from Kennywood, if you are visiting Kennywood you should definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Cash only & it was nasty. In a small shrimp with Chinese vegetables dish, there were a total of 4 shrimp and mostly cabbage that was as flavorful as cardboard."}
