{"text":"For the price, Rose Garden offers great Thai! With a variety of different Thai plates, you will be sure to find something to your liking at a reasonable price. The two times that I have been there, I have gotten the chicken curry and pineapple prawn curry with coconut rice. Both were excellent and filling!   The atmosphere is a relaxing Asian setting that is relatively business casual. Nothing too fancy, but not bad either. The restaurant is a little small, but it makes for a more personal experience.  Service at Rose Garden is a little slow (note: I was with a large party both times). The staff are pretty friendly and prompt about serving drinks. Food, however, comes out a little slower.   Overall, I would recommend stopping in if around the downtown area. Be warned, though, that street parking is tough to come by down around the restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my husband on a week day. The buffet looked old and dried out so we decided to order off the menu. The food was good but very expensive, probably due to the 8th avenue location. Unfortunately the service was dismal. Our server seemed indifferent to our presence and never came back after dropping off our food. It was quite spicy so we were desperate for a water refill."}
{"text":"In the last couple of years, we have been blessed with a real growth in the number of Thai restaurants in town.  Once upon a time I might have given this place four stars, but the competition has gotten stiffer in this category.  All of the Thai staples are served here, but the flavours are not as bright, and the presentation not as refined, as at places like White Elephant or Khao San.  For example, the pad thai is too sweet, and not peanut-y enough for my taste.  The curries are spicy, but lack some depth. Don't get me wrong, if you're in the downtown core and need a sweet/spicy/salty fix, you'll be sated here (tip: the rice is great and plentiful), but it's a interlude rather than a symphony.  The decor, a cross between a Buddhist temple and a thatched-roofed beach hut, feels really Thai but is also a bit tired.  This feeling is compounded by the low but unromantic lighting. The prices are average, but they have also have a 2-for-1 deal in the Entertainment Guide, which ensures I come back."}
{"text":"Small and cramped sitting area. Buffet is overpriced and limited in variety"}
{"text":"I can only visit downtown restaurants for dinner, so I never know what is popular and busy at lunch.  However, I was missing Thai food and picked up a Living Social voucher for this restaurant; I finally got the chance to cash it in this week.  When I entered I was pleased to find the restaurant was busy- about eight to ten other tables had customers.  I was greeted and seated quickly, and throughout the course of the meal service was prompt.  I'm a vegetarian, so I started with vegetarian spring rolls and then had vegetarian pad thai and vegetarian masaman curry (on steamed rice).  I was VERY impressed when the staff came back to the table twice- once to ask if I ate fish sauce (no) and once to inquire about eggs (yes).  In seven years of eating meat-free I don't think anyone has ever been that thorough!    The food was excellent.  The spring rolls were hot and crisp.  The pad thai was flavourful and had abundant tofu and eggs.  And the masaman curry was a stand-out... it had a decadent, rich flavour that contrasted the fresh vegetables perfectly.  Serving sizes were ample- the two main dishes easily served two people with leftovers to take home.    I will definitely return to Rose Garden, even without a coupon!"}
{"text":"Upon meeting a friend for a relatively late last minute lunch, we wandered up to Rose Garden thinking if the buffet was over we could always just order off the menu. We were pleasantly surprised that the buffet was still fully (and freshly) stocked.  I started with the hot and sour soup which was awesome, they didn't skimp on the veggies and the broth had the perfect tartness to it. We made our way around the buffet, grabbing spring rolls, pad thai, variety of skewered meats and tofu/seafood stews. I really enjoy Thai food because most of the time it's spicy, but it enhances the flavours of the dishes not overpower them with intense heat.  We probably ate more than our fair share of food, and ~$20 seemed like a steal for the quality of food we got.  I've heard that it is really busy here during lunch so I think we lucked out going later than the usual masses."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic however the staff didn't make us feel very welcome. One server in particular didn't smile or look like she wanted to be there at all."}
{"text":"There were two tables outside, one with a couple seated and waiting for their food. I ran up the stairs and asked if I could order food and have it down stairs outside at the table. She said yes. I placed my order of fresh rolls (I think they call them salad rolls) with tofu. 15 minutes went by and no one came down so I went back upstairs and asked about my order. They said they were making them. There was only one party inside and they were already eating and that couple outside at the other table was also already eating. I think she forgot to put in my order! Anyway, I paid and went back downstairs. 10 more minutes went by and she finally came down with our rolls. They were full of noodles, a tiny bit of white lettuce, and a bit of tofu. (see photo) What a rip! No herbs, no veggies, and it was 10 dollars for 6 bite size rolls!"}
{"text":"A wonderful experience with a culturally rich interior that can make you forget that your in downtown Calgary.  A note: It is located on the second floor, so it lacks disability access for people who struggle in climbing the stairs.  At first, the entrance of the restaurant was greeted with a dark, uninviting set of stairs. It reminds me of a haunted house.  Every time I go to a Thai restaurant, I always order a Thai ice tea and it was amazing. It was refreshing, cold and just the right amount of that oh so sweet evaporated milk. I highly recommend it.  Our first order was the calamari. It was nicely presented, cooked well, but it was bland. You have to add the sweet and sour sauce that came with it to add flavor.  Our main course was pad thai and hor mok kai, chicken wrapped in banana leaf with zucchini, basil and red curry paste. The chicken was really good that my girlfriend reminded of her food back home in the Philippines and it goes well with coconut rice. The pad Thai, on the other hand, was OK, nicely presented, but it lacked spiciness, and nuts which I love. The sauce could've been done better by adding just a bit more.  One of my Thai food craves to go. Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in Calgary thus far. Portion sizes are good, little pricey but worth it. Coconut rice is delicious, also ordered cashew chicken and red curry - looks a little rundown on the outside, but the interior is another story."}
{"text":"If you love Thai food like I do, DEFINITELY try the Rose Garden's Lunch Buffet (cost is around $15/person)  Everything from the salad rolls, all the way to the sticky rice mango dessert is DELICIOUS. Plus, being a vegetarian, it's nice to see they have meatless options in their buffet.  The decor is beautiful & welcoming, and the service has been good every time I have been.  Be warned: this place is PACKED during lunch hours, but it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Fresh Thai spring rolls were quite fresh and delightful.   Pineapple curry with prawns was excellent. Nice and sweet with lots of flavour.   Green curry chicken had just the right spice and was amazing. Only way to explain it.   Mixed both dishes with a large coconut rice that was shared. The large coconut rice incredibly tasty.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Stopped by for buffet lunch. The food was just okay, not particularly special, but certainly edible. The buffet selection, though, was tiny. Just not much to choose from. That and the price for buffet earn a solid three stars. I may go back, but this time to try some of the items off the menu instead.  The restaurant was long and narrow, but had a nice ambiance anyway. Service was decent and as friendly as could be expected. It's on 8th Ave., which makes it a part of the fashionable part of town."}
{"text":"I ended up at Rose Garden looking for somewhere to satisfy a bunch of different constraints... vegan-friendly, and not a chain... and everyone in our party was satisfied.  The food ranked up with some of the other amazing Thai I've had. The pad thai was excellent, and the various curries we ordered were also very tasty.   My only complaint about this place was that the service was a bit... awkward. The servers were nice enough, but kind of seemed a bit scared of people. Also, we all ordered coconut rice and each received a small order of rice... I would have thought that they would have suggested we get a few large orders to share, but oh well."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. One of my co-workers had been here before and said it was really good. In the end, I would have to disagree. The decor is pretty cool. It reminds me of a tiki bar with a twist of thai. It's pretty small but warm and inviting. There were by the windows that overlook Stephen Avenue Mall. Might be nice to sit there with the windows open a bit and watch everyone from above. (this place is on the second floor)  The service was pretty good. Our waitress kept our water glasses filled during our meal. We all had the buffet. Of course when I hear buffet I get excited and think I need to wear my stretchy pants. But not here. The buffet was like a dining room table size with the food warmers on it. Not a huge selection. It was just ok but really nothing memorable. I'm sure there are better places in this city. They had deep fried squid & shrimp, satay chicken, a coleslaw like salad, some interesting dipping sauces, and a small selection of deserts (didn't look that exciting). It gets busy at lunch so it's best to make a reservation. An even better idea is to make a reservation somewhere else."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Service: 3/5 Overall experience: 4/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  After reading positive reviews I finally decided to come here for their $15 lunch buffet. Definitely did not disappoint, some of the best Thai food I've had in Calgary for cheap! It may cost more than your average buffet but you get to try a variety of quality Thai dishes that you can decide to order on their menu another time. I highly suggest going early before the lunch rush (11:30 or even earlier is ideal) because:   1. the lineup gets pretty long (almost out the door)  2. and so you can try a bit of everything since they unfortunately are a little slow at restocking the buffet during the rush and there wasn't much left at the end of the rush. If you decided to take a group of people here make reservations in advance because my friend and I ended up sitting at the bar to eat.  The restaurant is pretty tiny and cooky with buddha/cultural statues placed near the entrance and bunches of dried flowers hanging down from the ceiling. Nothing too classy. The service was nothing to rave about.   There are about 15 items for you to try including two cold salads (one with some spicy beef and the other was papaya), coconut rice, Thai fried rice, various fish and meat curries, pad thai, Thai styled meat skewers, Thai spring rolls, spicy chicken tom yum soup, and desserts including mango sticky rice, fried bananas and coconut jellies/pudding. Everything was packed with flavour! The coconut rice was light and fluffy with a strong coconut flavour and the curries had a well balanced, light coconut curry flavor. Not one pad thai is the same and although I thought Rose Garden did a good job in terms of flavour (it wasn't overly sweet like candy) i thought it was missing some oomf. I think it needed maybe a squeeze of lime, nuts or the addition of more veggies.   I especially love their tom yum soup! It's a little greasy but uber delicious! If you love spicy foods this is the dish to try since it has a nice kick of spice, yet just the right amount of sourness from the lemon grass. Only complaint is that they didn't strain out that hard chicken cartilage and lemongrass pieces you from the stock. Their desserts round off the meal and if you are like me who loves deep fried goodness, you have to try the deep fried bananas there which had a nice crunch and wasn't overly battered or soggy.  Overall, if you're working downtown and looking for something new to try, give Rose Garden a visit. I beware you though, you might need a long nap afterwards. This is also a great opportunity for people who haven't had Thai food to try a little bit of everything from the buffet. Definately will come back!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good.  I only wish that they would use higher quality beef in their beef dishes."}
{"text":"I am no Thai food expert, but the dish I had was Epic! I ordered The Spicy Peanut stir-fry, Cashew Chicken, and Red Curry and it was really good. The restaurant people are friendly and there are cool looking statue decoration things.  On another occasion I came in 30 min before close and forgot some important medication. Well they looked me up (I had called earlier in the day) called, and stayed late 45 minutes for me to return and grab my medication that night. I am a diabetic and without my insulin I would have  been in huge, huge trouble. When I got there the lights were off and it was just the owner waiting reading the paper all dressed to go home.  So I must say go to this restaurant. The food is great and the service is AMAZING.   Please support this business"}
{"text":"This is my first favorite Thai Restaurant ever.  It started when I got off class from U of C and was terribly hungry, so me and my dine out friend decided to try Rose Garden.  We didn't know they have lunch buffet daily and the place was really pack, mostly business men dine their, so we manage to get a table and the buffet was nice and fresh, everything was delicious, and the Thai ice tea is to die for.    I also brought my family here for special occasion and they love it also.  The food always taste good and consistence.  The ambient is cozy and very Thai."}
{"text":"Was the worst service I have seen for many years. Ordered food, including pad thai noodles.  Curries and other food came out fine, after about 20 mins I told the owner to forget the noodles, as the food was almost finished. But he came back in about 5 min with the noodles. Nobody ate them, but he still charged for them.  Bad service and worse attitude, will never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible, un-attentive service by a rude waitress on a Friday night, with just mediocre Thai food mixed in.  I was in town on business by myself, and stumbled upon the restaurant.  I was seated at about 615pm on a Friday night, and it took at least five full minutes for the waitress to even look at me or pour me a glass of water.  The glass she put it in had someone else's lipstick mark on it, but before I could say anything or get another, she scurried away.  So I poured myself a new glass.  Had to pin down the waitress and ask to order, and then the food didn't come for 35 YES THIRTY FIVE MINUTES.  During that time period, the waitress never made any effort to refill my water even when my glass sat there empty.  I even flagged her down once to ask if the food was coming, and all she did was come back and bring the check, with no food, nor any explanation about when my meal might actually arrive!  I was just on the verge of getting up and leaving, wondering if this girl even spoke English, when the food finally came.  I ordered Tofu with Veggies and the Papaya Salad (Som Tam), and asked for it to be prepared for takeaway, since the restaurant seemed busy and had I thought that might mean faster service.  Turns out that rice does not come with the curries/ stir fries here, and the waitress never thought to mention that when I ordered.  So then I ordered some as an add on, and told her I had been waiting for thirty plus minutes without once receiving water, and she gave me serious attitude, no apology, nothing.  When I handed over the money to pay, there was no \"thank you,\" or God forbid a \"sorry to keep you waiting.\"   Turns out the girl spoke perfect English, no accent or anything, so I can't call her silent treatment simply a \"miscommunication.\"   Who cares what the food tastes like if the service is so wretched you can't enjoy your meal?  This place seems short staffed, but more than that they just don't give a crap about your experience.  Took the food to go, and ate back at the hotel, hoping at least  the food itself would provide some respite, but alas, it was simply mediocre.  It deserves ZERO stars.  OK, maybe half a star for the coconut rice, that was pretty good =)"}
{"text":"1 star - Service 3 star - Food = 2 stars overall We come here for dinner a few times a year because we like the food, but the service at dinner is always poor at best of times. Never a hello or thanks for coming and after seating you it's 10 minutes before they come back to take your order, so you better not have any questions and order everything at once. We came for dinner at 7:20 on a Saturday night, the place was full but most had already received their food. 13 minutes after sitting down a waitress came, and we ordered, a Thai bbq chicken, red curry beef, coconut rice and green tea. To our surprise our coconut rice arrived 4 minutes after we ordered. After waiting expectingly for 10 more minutes our red curry beef arrived and the waitress said she'd be right back with the chicken. Well no sight of any of the wait staff for another 14 minutes until our chicken came. The chicken was cut up and the joint of the drum stick was oozing blood. If we hadn't waited so long to get it I would have sent it back, but since we had already eaten most of our curry and rice by this time, I knew I would be taking it home to reheat for lunch, so I let it go and ate some of the well cooked portion. We asked for our tea and flagged down another waitress a few minutes later. Finally after 5 more minutes and a full half hour after we ordered our tea arrived. As usual there is never any apologies or even conversation with the staff, even though I am sure our waitress is one of the owners or manager. If their food wasn't usually good, we would never come back. If you are in a hurry or have a nearby show to catch this isn't the place to come."}
{"text":"My staff visited Rose Garden for lunch. The service was good but I wasn't overly impressed with the food. I had heard a lot of hype over it and maybe if I had ordered one of the rice or noodle dishes, I would've thought differently. The coconut chicken soup was good but the chicken salad was not. I picked at it but it did not have a great flavour. I'm not sure if it was the sauce or the chicken itself, but it tasted off. I probably won't visit again.  The decor is pretty cool though and the staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"I was able to make time last week to grab lunch early and it was decided that this was the place. Now, I have been here five times before and have been impressed with the food quality & flavour the most. Yes, a buffet at lunch sounds food court-like and one could glean food might be of a lesser quality. Not here, the food here is spectacular both in flavour and quality...all the chaffing dishes are smaller which increases the turn over of the hot fresh food. Selection is suitable - usually two chicken, one beef and some veg selections. Supporting the mains are other goodies such as veg rolls, both rice wrap and fried that are awesome with the peanut sauce.  The flavours and freshness make for a great stop for lunch. One note though...make a reservation to assure a seat, or show up no later than 11:20'ish or else you will be relegated to sitting at the bar which has about six seats. Great flavours, hot food and healthy as all items are recognizable!"}
{"text":"Tried the Rose Garden today for the lunch buffet, the food was allright for a buffet but not upto the quality of Thai Sa-On or Thai Nong Khai.  The buffet was clean and the food was replenished very consistently so there was no empty trays to deal with.  For a quick thai lunch downtown I would recommend Rose Garden. It does seem to be very busy so a reservation is probably a good idea."}
{"text":"If you love Thai food and don't mind the longest lunch line-up in downtown Calgary then you should definitely try the Rose Garden Restaurant lunch buffet.  All the downtown business folks can't be wrong, for just under $15 dollars you get amazing all you can eat Thai food.  It is a ridiculous price for what you eat, believe you me.  The Rose Garden is a tricky place to find even if it is on Stephan avenue, as you don't really expect it, but once you do find it, you have to go up the flight of stairs and you immediately get whisked away to a very elegantly exotic decorated restaurant.   Here you will be welcomed by an assortment of Buddha's and by a busy but extremely friendly hostess.    Try to avoid sitting at the back area by the buffet, it can get really tight fitting there as people are going to get their groove on but if you don't mind that you are then in fact the closest to the buffet and how convenient for your second or third fill ups.  Some RG highlights: the Masatman Curry, the Garlic Squid, the Calamari, the Chicken Green Curry and the Pad Thai.  This is obviously one of my favourite Thai places to eat in the city; hopefully it will soon be yours as well."}
{"text":"The food is decent, and a very good thing is that the hot sauce and spices are on a separate table, so you can mix it yourself.  If you are allergic to hot and spicy Thai food, you can still enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"This is def my new favorite place in Calgary!   Prices are alittle higher than I thought.   But food were delicious!   I ordered crab raccoon, I think they call gold bags   I tasted real crabs more than cream cheese.   Finally!!!  They used more crab meat inside!  Then I ordered hot red curry along with white rice (they even charged for rice) but it was delicious and perfect.   I recommend you to go to this place.   Just warn it's alittle dark place if you wanna go outside dining."}
{"text":"This restaurant seems like it's way past its prime. It seems like it might have been a decent place at some point in time but they've just lost interest.   Everything about this place was terrible. The staff seemed disinterested, the decor was elaborate but dated and unkept and the food was just about average. I guess we should have followed the usual rule of thumb and not entered a nearly empty restaurant at dinner time.   Please don't waste your time and money on this establishment."}
{"text":"Another lunchtime secret... except it's not because lunch hour is a busy, busy time! One of my friends is a sucker for sketchy looking food spots... restaurants, food stands, it really doesn't matter. If it looks questionable from the outside, she's in there faster than Peter Pan pouncing on his shadow.  Thankfully for me, Rose Garden is not sketchville. It's just a never ending buffet of Thai yumminess that I could've easily filled up on 2-3 more times if room in my stomach would allow!  The buffet isn't huge. Expect about 8-10 different items including some meats, noodles and the like. I'm not sure if they change out the buffet items each day or if they remain the same. The soup is likely to be different each time though. When we went, they said it was chicken noodle. What we should've known that it was the Thai version! Think chicken noodle meets sweet and sour soup.  On the list for favourite lunchtime buffet spots? I think so!"}
{"text":"Have had lunch here many times. You enter a doorway and go upstairs. Decor is lovely and service is decent. I've only tried the buffet here. Selection is good for lunch but not huge. They have staples like chicken curry, pad Thai, 2 kinds off rice, fried squid, green mango salad which is my fave- it has a serious spicy kick to it! Chicken wings are yummy and the dessert may vary from a tapioca to fresh fruit and mango jello or coconut jelly. Overall a solid lunch deal in a comfortable setting. My friends like this more than I do and I love the company but I'd not go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"This was super convenient to my hotel and was quite excited to talk about my recent trip to Thailand with the owner.  I opted against the buffet (which looked awesome) as I was really in the mood for some Tom Yum Koong and Panang.  Fantastic, fresh Thai ingredients aren't easy to come by in my neck of the woods but was pleasantly surprised that my dished were loaded with yummy galanga and kaffir lime leaves.  This is definitely worth a stop while in downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"This Thai food is not bad... Nothing really impressive, but I cannot say it was not good.. I think there are better Thai restaurants in Calgary; however, the location of this place is very convenient: I don't know any better Thai restaurant in Stephen avenue... And if you are walking around, and feel like Thai food, you can try Rose Garden; just be prepared for Thai food that will be just ok.. Nothing really wow!"}
{"text":"I was treated to a lovely lunch at Rose Garden Thai Restaurant yesterday.  I haven't been to this restaurant for such a long time.  The food was all-round pretty good.  The appetizers were the salad rolls and the papaya salad.  I liked the papaya salad as it cools your mouth down with the hotter and spicier food.    There were 2 kinds of rice:  fried pineapple rice and steamed coconut rice.  The coconut rice was warm and fluffy.  It goes so well with the Beef Thai Curry.  I found the beef a little tough.  The beef was also cooked with bamboo shoots and basil.  There was plain vegetables, vege bean thread vermicelli (tung-hoon), cashew chicken, thai bbq chicken, pork satay, calamari and spring rolls.    At the back table, the tom yum chicken soup resides as well as the different sauces like the satay peanut sauce, the chilli sauce and the dipping sauce for the rolls.  Also, at the back table, there was big fresh fruit platter and the wonderful SE Asian desserts.  Reminds me of home - the agar-agar (coconut jello), the banana fritter, the tapioca dessert and of course, the famous mango rice with coconut cream.  DELICIOUS!    It sure gets crowded in that skinny, long restaurant.  Everyone has to dodge people getting their food and/or coming back to their table.  I also found the plates were a tad too big and too heavy to carry back the food.  I hope they will change the plateware."}
{"text":"When we entered the restaurant at about 7:30 it was quite busy, but one hour later there were only two more tables occupied. Well, the food was quite ok, but nothing special. So were the Tom Yum soups. We chose the large portion and were really disappointed about the small bowls that were placed in front of us. I would like to see what the small portion is like. All in all I cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"This review is mostly just for Rose Garden's Thai food buffet. I have not ordered off the menu from Rose Garden.  At $15.95, Rose Garden's buffet is a pretty good value but the quality is not the greatest.  The restaurant is nice, the service is good, although I think it maybe sets itself up to be little bit \"fancier\" than it actually is.  I was surprised how many people coming in had reservations during a workday lunch hour, but the staff were still able to accommodate me and seat me at the bar.  Not too many of the dishes in the buffet were very memorable, however the calamari was maybe the most tender I have ever had and I went back a couple of times for the Red Beef Curry alone. Very delicious (especially when you hit the pockets of Thai basil).   I may not go out of my way for Rose Garden, but if I am hungry and wandering aimlessly around Stephen Ave., I could see myself stopping by."}
