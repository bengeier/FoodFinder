{"text":"I've been here twice now, and it's been love at first bite!

My friend and I checked this place out after talking about it for a few months now. (I was flyered at Bloor-Spadina back when they first opened.) I'm glad we finally went after all this time.

There are many items on the menu, so it'll take quite a while to get through all of them. I've only had the vegetable skewers so far, but they've all been quite tasty. Right balance between the vegetables' natural flavours and the seasonings they were cooked with. The corn and cherry tomatoes are particularly good. Roasted rice ball makes for a very good staple with your other skewers.

The tuna tataki is delicious. Best fish I've had since my BC trip this summer, and I eat fish all the time. I definitely recommend people try this one. Other good picks are the mackerel tataki (they torch it in front of you!), the grilled octopus, and the milk chip.

Bottom line, every food item my friends and I have tried have been a hit. They are all made very well, and the quality is there, too. Haven't dabbled much into their drinks (only bottles of warm sak√© so far.)

The place is a little quiet for an izakaya, and it wasn't near full either time we went. I imagine it's because this place is still new. Definitely spacious enough to grow a good customer base in the future, though. Service was friendly and efficient, too!

Definitely recommend checking it out. If this place becomes popular in the future, it'll be well-deserved."}
{"text":"Being one of the new Izakaya scene in Toronto, my friend and I cannot wait to give it a try. 

My friend and I showed up on a Saturday afternoon around 6 pm. The place is pretty empty but that is probably due to being a brand new restaurant on a street that is full of dining choices. That being said, the entire experience was wonderful. The entire staff is very friendly and constantly making sure that we have everything we need. From refilling our drinks to taking away our empty plates to ensure we have enough room for the upcoming plates, the entire dining experience is nothing short of spectacular.

The food was great. We ordered every possible skewer on the menu. The Miso beef tongue was especially good. While the miso sauce on the beef tongue was really pungent (in a good way), the lemon slice really cut down the thickness and added an extra level of flavour on the dish - whether it is by design or just an happy accident... I don't know. Bacon wrapped asparagus, how can you not like that combination? Bacon wrapped quail eggs, do I really need to say more? Both of us ended up order two GIANT glasses of Sapporo to accompany our dinner. One small complaint, the glasses weren't chilled prior to serving - but I am sure this is an easy fix. 

Another big plus, while the entire staff was enthusiastic in greeting each client, it was not over-done like places such as Guu (don't get me wrong, I love this place as well). The volume was just right and it didn't drag on. I can actually hear the conversation between my friend and I ^_^

Bottom line, I would definitely recommend Yaki Kushi bar to anyone who wants to try another izakaya place in Toronto. I am sure I will be visiting this place in the near future!"}
{"text":"food was great, but not quite something beyond expectation.
Also felt a little bit limited with food/drink choice."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an izakaya style meal (other than Guu), Yaki Kushi is a great alternative!

It wasn't busy here around 6 pm and we were able to be seated right away.
The menu has all kinds of yakatori options and they have some fantastic and refreshing cocktails.  The grapefruit + shochu was not too sweet! 

The Kaki Fry - deep fried oysters were crispy and delicious ($7.50). 
The chicken theigh cheese yaki was our favourite skewer ($1.90).
Cheesy and soft.

We ordered 4 to 5 items between the two of us and we were still hungry.
The firehouse sushi rolls seemed like a good idea, and they didn't disappoint! 
They were deep fried sushi with crispy seaweed on the outside.
The rolls hit the spot!

Overall, I liked my meal here.  The menu is small, the service is a little bit on the slow side, but it's a quieter restaurant that is good for catching up over some shareable items."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of yakitori places in Japan. I have been there 4 times now and I waited to post a review.   I love the food, the service, and the  fact that I can hear my dining companions (unlike some other restos).  I can see that this is also a popular place with Japanese nationals.  It is currently my favorite.  The only think missing from the menu is chicken skin skewers but there is so much else that is great."}
{"text":"Normally I don't write reviews after just 1 visit.
but this is a great place that I do want more people to know about.

This place is great!
It's pretty empty at around 5:30 to 6pm on a Saturday, but being a place that just opened up, it'll probably be really busy really soon onve people know how good it is.

We ordered most of the skewers item on the menu, from beef to pork to chicken and even liver, hearts and quail eggs wrapped in bacon.

Everything was soooo good, and the service was excellent. They didn't miss anything, and the pace was right on, just as we about to finish a dish another one is here. With the MEGA pints of beer, everything goes down smoothly. 

Since it's right on bloor st and with it back being the large parking lot, it's the perfect place to hangout after a long day at work or a cool drinking place tobe for a Saturday evening. 

I will try to be the regular here. (If not the dukedom of this place.)"}
{"text":"Opened only a week or so, (May 2014), they are trying hard and succeeding. 
It  classifies itself as an Izakaya 

I went with my teenage daughter and we had fun, a reasonable meal, that was sufficiently different to be interesting.

For example, I had never come across Avocado and Shrimp tempura before, a great combination. Chicken Karaage was easy and piping hot. We had several Yakitori, (skewers of meat or veggie), and all were well executed.
 The deep fried banana and ice-cream was lapped up.

The staff were falling over themselves to be pleasing and right now there is a 10% discount which makes it all great value.

Recommended at the moment."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey, but everything we tried were absolutely delicious, especially the takoyaki! My bf and I got two orders of it because it was just so good! We also got the skewer combo which was also good, but the portion is pretty small. Don't expect large portions at this place, but everything we tried was really tasty. Service was attentive and the overall place was a good experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely fell in love with the grilled gyu (beef) tongue, as well as the P-toro (pork) skewer. Extremely delicious. They are a must try! 

I wasn't all that crazy about the karaage, though. I've had better elsewhere, but that's just my personal taste. Also, I wasn't a fan of the umeboshi chicken skewer, but that was more due to the fact that it was too salty paired with all the other salty dishes. 

I most definitely will be returning with friends to try more menu items."}
{"text":"I suggested Yaki Kushi Bar for a girls' dinner and it was the perfect place for gossiping over a meal of meat on sticks and assorted deep fried goodies.

We were a group of 5 so we ordered liberally:  2 orders of their stick special that night which included 5 assorted skewers ($8.50), Chicken Karaage ($5.50), Takoyaki ($4.50), Avocado Tempura ($5.90), Shumai ($5.50), Yaki Soba ($8.30), Beef Short Ribs ($6.80), Seafood pan cake ($6.80), and Tuna Tataki ($6.90), along with an assortment of drinks including a pitcher of Sapporo ($16.99).  It was more than enough food...we had to pass on dessert.

Dishes were all pretty tasty...how could I say no to deep fry?  Service was quick, friendly and our dishes came at a good pace.  Atmosphere was definitely not as crazy or loud as some other Izakaya places that I've been to - it was more relaxed and low key.

Definitely recommended if you want to treat yo' self to a meal of delicious appetizers."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying a Izakaya restaurant, but I remember getting a flier for the place from a nice girl and thought the menu looked interesting. It was really the black sesame ice cream that drew me in!

Had the Tataki Tuna, and I did nothing short of falling in love with it. I even told my boyfriend to stop talking so I can savor the taste! 

Really enjoyed the chicken liver skewer as well, and the black sesame ice cream was creamy with no hints of ice shards. 

Service was pleasant, I would say above average, but it was really the food that stood out the most to me. Definitely recommend people trying it!"}
{"text":"I went there 3 nights in a row for dinner just to try everything on their menu. Ultimate conclusion is: the beef tataki, ebi mayo, beef short ribs, and the firehouse sushi are my favourites!! I liked this place a lot more than Guu truthfully.. it's more reasonably priced with more generous portions. Definitely on my recommendations list."}
