{"text":"The Salomon salad for lunch was simply the best food I have eaten for 11 bucks.  The service was fantastic.  Sometimes I wonder if people who complain about bad service receive bad service because they are not the friendliest people themselves.  I also was here for a grooms dinner and there wasn't a complaint in the party.  My beef tenderloin was awesome!"}
{"text":"I called to ask if they take reservations for the Stable Grill as their website doesn't make it clear, but someone named Phil hung up on me twice when I asked.   So, maybe it has good food (I guess I'll never know), but the service brings a new definition to terrible."}
{"text":"I've now been to Quivey's Grove twice: both times I was completely underwhelmed by the food, although the service is friendly and fantastic. My first entree was the meatloaf. Full disclosure: I make AWESOME meatloaf, so I AM biased. QG's offering was not bad, just forgettable and in need of salt. On my second visit, I ordered the Black Angus Steer tenderloin medallions, which came with a Madeira mushroom cream sauce, sauteed vegetables, and parmesan potato. The first thing that struck me was that nothing on the plate went with anything else. The sauce on the medallions (which were tender and juicy) was excellent: I could imagine serving the entree over mashed potatoes or even polenta. Instead, it waged war on the parmesan potatoes: a nasty, clearly pre-cooked, cheesy potato casserole that more resembled something you might find at a potluck. The other filler, sauteed julienne peppers, also clashed with its plate-mates.  In a word: DISAPPOINTING. QG isn't an inexpensive place to eat, and I would expect quite a lot more from the food for the cost."}
{"text":"Overpriced and over rated  If you had $30/# worth of Kobe beef would you smother it in mayo and syrupy barbecue sauce?  Quivey does, and it's a good thing to, because it's the worst kind of nasty that I have tasted.  If your are looking for an excess of pretension with a complete lack of quality that is significantly over priced, look no further."}
{"text":"there are two parts to quivey's - the stable grill and the stone house. both buildings - built in the 1850s- are part of the national register of historical places. they're beautiful and home-y.   i've only eaten at the stable grill, and that during uw's graduation weekend, so it was pretty crowded with family folk. i'm not sure what a normal weekend looks like there, but i'd definiely be back to try it again.   it's my understand that the stone house is the fancier of the two buildings since the stable grill has a bar and is a little more laid back. but the grill is nice. it's not an applebees, not your neighborhood bar. if i wanted a nice steak and expected to spend a fair amount of money and wanted a good meal to take my family or visiting friends to, this would be it.   i think the stable house may be more ideal for smaller parties?   anyway, the food's great. the atmosphere is excellent. it's a great great spot."}
{"text":"This was a big disappointment. One person ordered a pretzel appetizer and was brought a basket of stale hard pretzels from a bag. Most places would give these away, not charge $3.75. Two other people in our group ordered chicken sandwiches which seemed like they had been frozen and deep fried. I had a pulled pork sandwich which was unremarkable but was the best thing we ordered. I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"I have been to Quivey's Grove about 6 times I have never had a bad experience.  I like there Wednesday night fish fry a lot of food for the price.  There burgers are great.  Friday's is there busiest day to go there the restaurant is packed there is always along wait on Friday's.   I have never had to wait any other day."}
{"text":"Somewhat hard to find place especially at night. My friend and I had to drive around a couple of times before we could locate this place. Now that is the only negative, the rest is a quaint and interesting place. It is located in an old farmhouse and stable. Excellent beer, fish fry and deep fried cheese curd. Don't just settle for the food but do walk around and  check the place, especially the underground tunnel!"}
{"text":"The Stone House - pricey and slower paced. The Stable Grill - more sandwichy  Sorry to say the place has slipped....another victim of popularity. But I've come here for the ambience, the history, the property itself, the buildings themselves.  The ability I have to steep myself in the history. I even like looking at the stones.  (see website pics)  As to the food....unfortunately, slipped in quality along with the service.  It's still good but price/value at the Stone House is definitely down while the Stable Grill is more, well ---- stable.  Never been to the parties - the fish frys, barbeques, or picnics and the like - so no comment on those.   The bottom line is OK, if pricey, food in a wonderful environment.   If you're looking for fabulous food, not here.  If you enjoy the environment at least as much as the food you want, order the basics to be safe."}
{"text":"Quivey's Grove, the Stone House restaurant. This was a wonderful experience, from the charming and accommodating service, to the historic house, all smoothing the way for an exquisitely American meal. The meal itself was bite-for-bite one of the best meals for the money in the mid-range restaurant. The dreaded mid-range of 20-30 dollar entrees has been the hardest for me to feel good about spending money on, and has usually led to the biggest disappointments in dining. This was an exception. The restaurant is in a mid 1800s farm house outside Madison and is neatly appointed with names for each room and art variations for each, that accented rather than competed for attention. Clean, blonde woods, quilts and mostly antique printed illustrations allow a fresh and unsuspicious feel to the rooms.  We went on a Tuesday evening and received two strawberry muffins as the bread service that complimented a perfectly prepared Old Fashioned cocktail. We ordered the 'Wilcox Duck', with wild rice and poached apples, and the appetizer sampler as an entree. The sampler had Weiss sausage, cucumber pickle and pickled onion in a melted cheese, mini-cheese tarts, stuffed mushrooms, trout roulade, and my favorite, a poultry stuffing pastry with cherries. All the dishes had been named for historical american men and referenced them in some dimension in the description and execution of the dish. Notably the fare did appear to be distinctly American in its character by way of the ingredients, execution, or both. The service was exceptional and accommodating and meal sharing was made ideal with the division on the dishes and serving them separated as if they were intended to be. Since this night was slow, our waiter gave us a tour at the end of the meal adding depth to our new knowledge of the place. I cannot stress enough that all the components of the meal were done perfectly, absolutely no complaints. I would recommend this to a humble diner or a snob believing both would be pleased with the result. I do not understand complaints about the prices here, as they are exactly in line (or under valued) with the quality of the meal. I wish I lived closer as to eat here more frequently. An excellent value, a gem. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Lunch here was a delicious experience in a charming atmosphere.  I had the Quivey's burger, which was done to perfection and just the lunch I needed after skipping breakfast!  I would highly recommend eating here to anyone who wants delicious food and drink with excellent service in an historic setting."}
{"text":"I've lived just down the street from Quiveys Grove for many years.  Their fish fry is one of the best around, especially when they setup outdoor tent seating during the summer and fall."}
{"text":"Went to the Stone House on a Saturday. We didn't have a reservation but were able to get a table. My husband ordered the old fashioned (very tasty!) and I had a nice dry red wine. They had really interesting specials, my husband loved the Swedish meatballs. I had the Aldo Leopold-inspired vegetarian plate with goat cheese crepes, potatoes (delicious) and veggies. The crepes were a bit heavy but overall a nice meal. The ambiance and service were fantastic. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I have dined here several times over the years and have enjoyed it for the most part. However, my husband and I went 2 weeks ago for our anniversary and the food was truly awful. I ordered the special- :a tenderloin medallion and salmon filet\". The salmon was raw on the inside, only a quarter inch of it was actually cooked. The \"tenderloin\" was grisly, fatty, tough and disgusting. My husband's mashed potatoes were cold and gummy. Our waiter was painfully awkward, I felt bad complaining. I will never go here again, espcially considering the price."}
{"text":"Best fish fry in Madison. The cheesy hash browns are amazing. Best thing about this place is the atmosphere of the old, rustic, lively, and clean barn. Just terrific. Worst thing about this place: the bar set up: awkward. Its always crowded and you just end up standing there looking for a place to park. Its hard to get a drink while waiting for a table. It would be ideal if they'd expand the bar and add more tables and standing tables. A bar area waitress would keep people happy and their drinks full too."}
{"text":"Feels like a step back in Wisconsin time, the interior design and furniture is all cut, carved from local materials. Food is average, service is average."}
{"text":"YUM-MY! Tried this place out with the kids for their Friday night fish fry and there was no trace of disappointment!  Outdoor tent seating was the first available, and I'll choose it again, as it allowed us to watch our 2-year-old and 5-year-old play in the enclosed field with the other kids, while we drank our Spotted Cows.  Fish was fantastic and reasonably priced (both adult meal and kid meal), with an \"all you can eat\" option just an additional $1.50.  If you have young kids, make sure you find & explore the cellar tunnel that stretches between two buildings on-site.  Fun & cool"}
{"text":"I have been to Quivey's a few times over the years.  The experience which was recently had was absolutely horrible.  We had high hopes as we were greeted by a kind and attentive hostess and escorted to an upstairs room at the Stone House. Nothing went well from that point forward.  Our waiter, who knows what his name was, was loud and intrusive. We ordered the fish fry...again Quivey's is known for their fish fry...they are now in my book known for it being terrible.  We order and ask the simple question about are french fries and Parmesan potatoes.  We received a look of disgust as if we were asking a bizzare question.  Finally our order is placed, it takes quite a bit of time before we get our bread and coleslaw.    Now the main meal. The tarter sauce, how can someone screw up tarter sauce...it happened!  It was terrible...I am not sure what the chef accidentally spilled in it, but GROSS!  The fish batter was thick and soggy.  The fish itself was unflavored.  The waiter stops to check on us after about 15 minutes into our food arriving and asks how our food was.  My reply was simply, ok at best.  The look on his face was utter shock like he had never heard someone unhappy with their meal.  Then his voice got loud, and offered that I could get something else.  Well, it was about 8:30p by this point.  I had eaten a majority of my incredibly soggy french fries and terrible tasting fish due to purely being hungry.  I did not have the time or the energy to wait for another awful meal to arrive.  Needless to say if you are still reading...we will not be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish fry on Wednesday!  I orders and picked up my food, but the atmosphere was really nice and the staff friendly and accommodating!  The fried fish and the coleslaw were both really really good. highly recommended"}
{"text":"The food was okay. However, the service was questionable. Burgers and fries were greasy. Perch was greasy. Trout was okay. Group said ribs were good. We got there right as evening meal was staying and the waitress was not very friendly. Lots of scowling at us. Certainly not the Quiveys Grove we remember from years ago. Certainly not our recommendation for a Madison dining experience!"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night at Quivey's Grove, and the food wasn't great. I had the Reuben, which had soggy rye bread, dry edges on the brisket slices and a spoonful of sauerkraut and cheese. My bf had the Stable Burger, which had almost stale tough to bite through buns and a patty in BBQ sauce and mayo? The only thing I enjoyed, probably because I was uber hungry at the time, was the Cheese Beer Sausage Soup."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner and would recommend The Stone House at Quivey's for special occasions for sure.  The home is quaint and feels warm; the property is gorgeous.  We enjoyed our server and her attention to detail, as well as, excellent recommendations as our food was superb."}
{"text":"My review of Quivey's Grove is based on my experiences with groups. I've been here a couple of times with groups of 40-50 people. They have always been outstanding. Easy to work with, great service, good food - love the fresh muffins, popovers and apple crisp - and a really unique setting. The buildings consist of a historic home, where you can dine in a series of rooms on both first and second floors, and the stable, where you can also dine on two levels or in the bar. The stable is connected to the home with an underground tunnel that also serves as the wine cellar.  In the warm weather, they also have a paddock area for picnics and outdoor receptions.   I have only dined at Quivey's Grove in the winter around the holidays and I love the atmosphere. So warm and cozy.    I have only had positive experiences here and will definitely not hesitate to go back, as well as refer it to other groups."}
{"text":"Living on their reputation.  I've been coming here for years but find their ever rising prices for mediocre food to be too much.  Tonight we got there around 5:15 and the parking lot was half empty so figured we wouldn't have to wait too long.  We were told 20-30 minutes. OK.  An hour later my wife checked in again and we were told 20 minutes.  Yeah, right, someone screwed our reservation up I think.  So finally at 6:40 we get in and I noticed the prices were significantly higher than what I remembered from last time.  $14 for a cod dinner?  So screw it I ordered a burger with a glass of water, one daughter also only had water. They had meatloaf, perch and chicken. No appetizers or desert.  With tip the meal was over $70.  And it wasn't worth $40.  I'm done with the place.  Just too many other great places to eat out in Madison for much more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The three of us stopped here for their fish fry.   We arrived at 6:30 and there was already 1:30 hr wait.   So we got drinks from the bar,  very friendly bartenders and the host even have us a bread basket while we waited outside in the cool picnic area.   Once we were seated the server arrived immediately took our drink orders as well as our fish orders.   The beers and slaw arrived right away, along with a bread basket.  The artisan bread was very good. The slaw was shredded finely with light dressing.   We didn't have to wait long for the fish to arrive.  We all got the fried fish,  two of us got fries,  and the other got the parmesan potatoes. The fries were nothing special,  but the parmesan potatoes were amazing!  It was a slice of casserole-style cheesy, shredded hash browns. The fish was also very good,  salty,  crisp batter, and flaky chunks of hearty cod. For $1.50 more you can choose the AYCE option. However,  a single serving was plenty for us,  we even had leftovers.   The price tag of $13.25 for fish fry is more expensive than other establishments but it's fantastic fish.  One member of the party even commented that this was the best fish he's ever had."}
{"text":"Quivey's Grove covers a lot of of ground when it comes to dining options.  There are two seperate restaurants on the property, the Stone House and the Stable Grill, as well as an outdoor tent called the Paddock where there is a Friday fish fry and at other times picnics and barbeques.  I've been to Quivey's quite a few times and I've always been impressed by how well they pull off the different aspects of all of these options.  I personally prefer going to the Stable Grill for lunch, as this is a bit easier on the wallet.  The Stone House is a very old mansion that has been converted to a formal restaurant.  The entrees are all named after historical Wisconsin figures, as in the Dewey pork, named after the first state governor.  The walls are decorated with antiques and other historic relics from Wisconsin's past.  I recently had dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday, and we were seated in a small room on the second level, completely private and with a small window looking out to the lawn.  It was a great experience.  My meal (the aforementioned Dewey pork) was excellent, and I especially enjoyed the side salad with a citrus vinagrette and strawberry and apple slices.  On previous occasions I have always been seated downstairs in the main dining area since my grandmother doesn't handle steps all that well.  The prices for entrees here are certainly on the high side - mine was over $20 - but the service is impeccable and the atmosphere is well worth it for special occasions.  The only drawback to the evening was my drink - too light on the J&B and too heavy on the water.  Also, the Stone House is the only part of Quivey's that takes reservations.  The Stable Grill is a much more affordable option for repeated visits.  The building is a renovated barn and the decor keeps with theme.  Some of the tables are made of old wagon wheels.  It's a livelier place, and on weekends a piano player is in the bar (he happens to be a UW professor and I took one of his classes my last semester).  The entrees and sandwiches are named after local towns, and both the lunch and dinner menus are well balanced.  I especially like the Middleton perch filets and Paoli beef tenderloin.  The prices are a step lower here, and there are nightly specials for each day.  My favorite is the Monday tenderloin special.  There is also an outdoor element to Quivey's in the form of a big tent in the lawn in front of the Stable Grill.  On Friday nights there is a fish fry special and this is where to bring kids because there are plenty of games and room to run around.  Businesses or groups can also rent this out for lunch picnics or barbeques, and there are sometimes weddings done out on the lawn.  I've been to a barbecue put on by a vendor and it was really well done.  There was pulled pork and smoked brisket sandwiches with Spotted Cow.  An acquaintance of mine had a wedding here too.  I didn't go, but mutual friends have always told me it was a success despite a little inclement weather.    Lastly, there is a beer tasting festival that happens in September.  It's been a favorite of a couple friends of mine and I'm looking forward to going this year."}
{"text":"It's truly an amazing Wisconsin experience and one worth going to.  The interior is stellar - it's a converted farmhouse that is heavy on the wood with an eye catching bar when you walk in.  It's rustic without being too country and is the reason why it got an extra star from me.  The food, to be honest, was mediocre.  I had the pretzl batter fish fry, which was good, but not amazing.  The cheesy hash browns was a nice touch and definitely a plus on the dish.  I felt the need to dribble a little bit of hot sauce to counterbalance the cheesiness, but otherwise good.  Honestly, if you have the chance, it's worth stopping by for at least a drink and potentially a meal."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE their fish fry! You can actually taste the \"beer\" in their breading. I always dine in the stable... the farmhouse is quaint but not my style. I mean where else in Madison can you dine in a stable (it's warm and romantic!)? The stable tap bar has a good assortment of good local beers, and you just HAVE to get their old fashioned brandy with cinnamon stick! They MUDDLE! It's the ONLY place I'll drink an old fashioned with brandy (I'm a whiskey girl) - cuz they do it right. Cory is the ONLY bartender I go to - he is focused, polite, and the best Muddler in town.  As for the main meal: If you like the basic boring Friday night fish fry, this is not your place. The secret is NOT in the tartar sauce. This will NOT remind you of 7th grade with braces, bad hair, fishing poles, skillets, and a family reunion. This is a fish fry that got drunk and rolled around in flour while his \"fun\" cousin got into a pretzel fight, and the younger scared sister is hiding in butter. I LOVE these fish. We share the combo plate ($19): pretzel crusted PERCH - crunchy, warm, flavorful, eye-widening; BAKED COD - dry, flaky, warm, bland goes perfect with the decadent dill, garlic butter sauce (I use the fish as an excuse)! and BEER battered COD - tastes like beer, hot, wet-flour, heavy breading. EACH one of these is great, but I have to have them all.  baked cod with butter 4/5, baked cod without butter 3/5 (on the combo platter: sometimes having a bland piece of fish is ok to go with the other heavy battered items), perch 5/5, beer battered 5/5  PS. Skip the baked potato; GET the parmesan potato casserole - slap ya momma good! 5/5 Coleslaw here is my golden standard: wet, julienned, perfect mayo to vinegar ratio. 5/5  Great ambiance, great tap beer, great people, great food, AT LEAST an 1 1/2 wait to eat. (they have apps - order them and wait). The beer battered cod can be AYCE.  TIP: try the Stone House - 1800s menu = Duck, trout, lamb, veal, and different starter bread = sweet muffins!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Friday fish fry. I can't find a better place in Madison."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Quivey's stable grill. They have one of the best (if not the best) fish fries in Madison. They make excellent brandy old fashioneds and their fried pickles are great. Their seafood chowder which is also served Fridays is so good. The Parmesan potatoes that come as a side are excellent. We've always had great service and love the ambience of the old building. One of our fav places around Madison!"}
{"text":"They're not rated best fish fry in Madison out of luck. Go to Quiveys! Get the beer battered cod! You will die."}
{"text":"We went here on the reviews on spoon and we greatly suprised. The outside and inside decor are classic Wisconsin. However the meal was horrible. They were out of perch so my second choice for dinner was a Kobe burger with blue cheese and bacon. It sounded delicious but it wasn't medium rare. Simply the worst burger I've ever ordered. Cheese curds are good and so was my friend's Ruben but that was it. Service wasn't good and the server took my glass with beer still in it. Still debating on whether or not to give them another shot."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a Valentines night dinner. We ate in the stone house. We were led up upstairs to an intimate room with low candlelight adorned with vintage keepsaks one of which was an elegant handmade quilt that hung on the west wall. Once seated, a seasond waiter went over the menu with us and suggested not only restaurant favorites but dishes that were significant to the theme of the restaurant itself. We ordered and appitzer sampler consisting if cheese strudel trout cake stuffed mushrooms and cheese tartw. Light flavorful and delicious. For the main course I order Salmon Oscar with cheese patato cake. Perfectly cooked seasoned. My love got the lamb chops. Fall off the bone goodness. Everything was cooked to perfection and light. I would recommend this fabulous place to the casual and foodies alike."}
{"text":"I don't care how 'historical' a place is if the food and service are seriously lacking.  My first, and last experience at Quivey's was yesterday.  They only had ONE person running the entire place for lunch. I feel sorry for her. She tried to keep up...kind of. I can deal with slow service IF the food is really good, but it isn't. I'm assuming this menu has been in place since the 1800's. Small, boring, over-priced portions of 'so-so' food.  Another place where the reputation from when the place WAS great somehow keeps the older crowd coming back...reminiscing for the past."}
{"text":"Food...is ok. It's very easy to drive past this establishment, which I think is part of its charm.  My bf and I decided to eat at the stable and bar section (there's also the fancier house dining room) and we loved the wooden coziness of the interior.  However, while the prices were cheaper, the food wasn't too memorable.  The mushroom dish was overcooked, and the flavor was on the weird side. On the other hand, the ribs were delicious.  Overall, solid American food, but I might give the other dining option a try next time."}
{"text":"Descriptive phrase: rustic drinks and eats.  Came to the barn portion of Quivey's Grove with the fish fry highly touted. We started in the bar while we waited for a table. Not a large selection of beer, but quality choices. You should skip those, though, and opt for one of the best Old Fashioned's (~$7) you're ever going to have. You know it's special when each comes with a whole cinnamon stick inside.   We each ordered the Beer Battered Cod ($13.25). I am not a coleslaw person, but I scarfed their version (a little creamy, a little oily) down. The amount of fish given was perfect, filling me without weighing me down. And the fish itself was golden brown and crispy, exactly how it should be. It was definitely worth the wait when paired with the drinks at the bar. Quivey's is a neat experience with a good fish fry and better drinks."}
{"text":"OK, here's the deal: don't go to the Stable Grill. Go to the Stone House. I have actually never eaten in the Stable, and I always feel like a total genius when I have a drink there after dinner and see tons of people waiting on a table for fish fry at 9:00.  I've always gone with a reservation, but I've even made the reservation 20 minutes before showing up. Super easy.   Eating in the Stone House feels very old school, and it's definitely an older crowd than the Stable. It feels like you're eating in someone's cool great-aunt's house, with old pictures of Wisconsin and famous people on the walls, fresh flowers on the tables. The menu focuses on Wisconsin traditional foods, and each dish has a short story that goes with it, which is kind of cool. My boyfriend had the duck, which came with a cherry sauce that was dynamite, though the duck was slightly overdone. I got the fish fry with their cheesy potatoes, which are awesome.  Dinner always comes with some kind of freshly baked, still-warm muffin or roll, which are always different, and so adds something special to each experience. The last time I was there it was some kind of cranberry-orange muffin, which was awesome. They make a perfect Old Fashioned as well.  To me, this is a quintessential Wisconsin experience. If you have family in from out of state, this is a great spot to take them to. Just make a reservation at the Stone House, and then you have an excuse to walk through the underground tunnel/wine cellar to get to the Stable for a nightcap."}
{"text":"Good but not great. After three visits we have given up on the place. I would like it to be better but for the price it just makes me yawn. Nothing exciting or compelling here."}
{"text":"Unplanned, we ended up on a double date here last night at the Stable Bar & Grill yesterday. For those of you are not familiar, Quivey's has an upscale restaurant in the historic landmark house and then they have the stable bar and grill that is more casual right next to it on the same property. Additionally, there is a cool tunnel that joins the two if you want to get a drink at the bar and walk under to the nicer restaurant.  Last night, we went bowling at Ten Pin Alley, right next door, and decided to get a drink. Well, a drink turned into dinner. We were seated right away in this cool, restaurant in an aged old stable. We ordered drinks with our waitress and when she returned with them, we ordered our meals. My boyfriend and I, ordered an order of fried pickles to share as an appetizer and then also wanted side salads before our meal. The waitress brought the pickles, salads AND their free bread all at the same time. It was really overwhelming and in poor taste. We all received our entrees and they were good, but i felt really overpriced (entrees are $17-$25) for the quality we received. My boyfriends $20 pork chop, was nearly all fat. I ordered the trout, that was good, but they put so much garnish under the meal, that i actually had to work to remove the trout from the garnish to eat it. Additionally, at the end of our meal, the waitress split our bills. We didn't' even look at our receipt and sent back our credit card right away. Well, our friends got charged for our salads and when she came back with our card, we told her. Instead of just letting it go, she asked for our card back to charge us for her mistake. Now, we are anxiously awaiting a double charge from this restaurant.   I feel bad writing such a poor review. I have eaten at the main restaurant, and it was a memorably great experience."}
{"text":"Quivey's Grove has a very unique atmosphere. It is an old renovated barn with a decent sized bar area, and dining on the first floor and in a loft. From the outside it almost looked too small to accommodate the number of people that I expected to be inside based on the number of cars in the parking lot. To our surprise we were able to be seated immediately up in the loft area. It took some time for our server to greet us and bring us waters, but I blame that on the trek she was required to constantly make up the stairs, & not poor service. She was very attentive & good at multitasking. She would make sure everyone seated upstairs had what they needed before going back downstairs to bring an order up.   I had their fish fry, which was fantastic. The bread they served was warm, & wonderful, & the cheese curds we ordered as an appetizer were amazing. They also had a great selection of beers on tap. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Two reviews in one day!  GO ME!!!  So my wife and I had a date night and Quivery grove was the place!  I have never been before and I know my wife has for lunch and loves the atmosphere so..lets do it.  She loves old historical places and wishes I could love them too.  I told he when she begins to love football, I will begin to love historical places.  I think I am safe.  So we get there and were seated immediately.  it was a warm and cozy atmosphere and the people who work there were beyond friendly and nice.  A nice change from my last review.  Now down to the \"meat\" of things, tsss tss.  I ordered the Stuffed Chicken and my wife got the New York strip.  Yes, this is a roll reversal for us but hey....it happens.  Upon biting into my chicken I thought it was bland and lacking flavor.  My wife was not thrilled with her steak either so we switched and she LOVED the chicken.  I will say the steak was ok but not what I expected form a place supposedly know for their meat.  It was a little tough as a New York strip should be but just was missing something.    Would I go to Quivey's Grove again....sure but it would not be my first choice for steak but willing to give it another try!"}
{"text":"Love the Stable Grill. Great drinks, great food, great atmosphere. So romantic around Christmas. I just wish they had more variety on the menu. We try to go here often."}
{"text":"Meh. My boyfriend and I live down the road from Quivey's, so I imagine we will definitely be returning in the near future. The bar is very cool, but the food could use some work.   The ambiance is amazing. I love the architecture and how they've preserved the space. The bar is one of the most beautiful I've seen in Wisconsin, so it has that going for it. The drinks we ordered (Manhattan and Old Fashioned) were also very, very good. I was impressed with the bartenders.  However the food could definitely use some improvements. We started with their ham, beer and cheese soup and it was way to heavy on the ham flavor. Tone it down a bit and the soup would be much better. I had the fish fry, which was pretty good. Not too greasy, and the cheesy potatoes were great (although cold when I received them). My boyfriend ordered the ribs and he would absolutely not recommend them. He couldn't even finish them they were so dry and overcooked. They smelled like they had been cooked yesterday and re-heated in the microwave.   I had the caramel blondie for dessert and it was just okay. Kind of dry, and not ooey gooey like I was expecting.   Like I said, will we return? Yes, but only because we live so close. Hopefully next time the food is a bit more impressive."}
{"text":"I've only been in the Stone House during restaurant week. However, I was very impressed. The restaurant has a great homey atmosphere. They give fresh muffins instead of bread, that were even warm when we got them. Plus, our waitress was nice enough to wrap up the ones we didn't eat. My food was delicious and filling. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Visited on a Monday evening while in town for work and chose to eat at the Stable Grill part of this restaurant. I loved the rustic wood throughout this restaurant which I thought added to the laid-back yet lively ambiance. I was seated on the second floor. I started with with their specialty old fashioned and lived the addition of cinnamon stick as I am certainly a fan of cinnamon. I had the trout for dinner which was cooked perfectly and topped with a mustard sauce that was a great flavor addition to this fish. My waitress Kelsey was lovely and helped with a special request I had. I really loved how this establishment had a story and you could learn a little about the history of the building while you were there."}
{"text":"Beer battered Cod was the worst fish ive ever had. Holy grease pile! Then the fries were fried in the same oil and same consitency when biting into them. Grease. Yuck! Coleslaw was pretty good. Bread at beginning of meal was very tasty. Dining companion had the Chicken Marxville (?). It was one of the ugliest plates of food ive ever seen. She said it tasted like a \"frozen chicken breast with some poorly cut veg and some brown goop drizzled on it. For $60 for the 2 of us we expected much much more. Also server was very...meh. Not going back anytime soon, and never again will i eat that grease pile called beer battered cod!"}
{"text":"Thursday nights special is a plate of ribs with a side of potatoes drenched in cream and a smidge of sweet cranberry sauce.  I order a full rack of beef ribs.  There were about 12 ribs.  Mm... It was good!  The place is low key, with dark wood furnishings and moderate light, but also with pretty loud pop/contemporary music.  I sat upstairs.  The waitress was very pleasant.    The meal came with bread and butter, which I loved.  It tasted so good I had to try to not to fill myself up before my entree arrived.  MM... the ribs were good.  I love meat and starch, so this was a lovely meal."}
{"text":"We made the mistake of eating at the Stable Grill. It had been a while since we had been there. The service was terrible. The food was also nothing to write home about. I think it will be another five years before we venture back, if ever again.Very disappointing.."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch at the Stable Grill over the weekend.  It was a late lunch, so they offered the lunch and the dinner menu to us.  It was an odd time, so it was dead.  The server was very nice and attentive.  2 of us had chicken sandwiches, which were both very good.  The fries were OK.  We also ordered a grilled cheese for the kiddo.  It was good and the kids meal was cheap!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years, but over the last year or so, I would have to agree with many of the other reviews, that it has gone down hill. (this is in regards to the stable only, never eaten in the house.)  Ambiance is fantastic, service is fine, food is sub-par. Meals come out quickly, but somehow still cold.   That being said, their parmesan potatoes may be some of the best potatoes I've ever had, in my life. Even when they are cold."}
{"text":"I have been to Quivey's Grove twice since moving to Madison, the first was during Winter Restaurant Week in 2013 and most recently a company party. During my first visit, I traveled from the stable to the house via the underground tunnel. That alone is worth the visit. The food at that time was spot on, though, it was odd eating upstairs in what would have at one time been a bedroom. But it's an older house, so it was... quaint?  My more recent visit allowed me to enjoy the stable (or barn, for the commoners). They have a fully stocked bar, but I wouldn't go there if you're looking to watch the big game. It's a small TV towards the far end of the bar; I don't think sporting events is the reason people go there though. The ambiance however, definitely worth the trip.  For dinner it was a salad with a fruit flavored vinaigrette and raspberries (if I remember correctly) mixed in with the greens. Dinner was their gluten free chicken dinner with a mushroom and rice on the side. Not that I'm gluten free, I just wanted some chicken. Two sizable breasts were served as a part of the entree. They leaned more towards the dry side as opposed to the moist end. But, still the highlight of what was on my plate. Dessert was an apple and cherry crumble with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. The only way you complain about that is if you don't like America. KIDDING!  Be careful when you leave, the exit can be a little confusing. Especially at night. Especially in the winter with fresh snow."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place.  The food was good, the ambiance was fantastic.  If you go, make sure you go through the tunnel.  The only downside was the price."}
{"text":"Went here on a recent Friday for the first time.  I ordered the Lamb Doty, which was tasty.  My companion ordered the special, which I believe was Pretzel-Crusted Rainbow Trout.  He also enjoyed his meal, and we liked the fruit muffins that were served first.  We ate in the Stone House, as the Stable Grill was roaring at dinnertime on a Friday.  There was no wait, and the place was charming.  Stone House had a pretty nice menu, which differs from the one over in the Stable Grill.  The two buildings are connected via an underground tunnel, which we though was a fun feature.  Service was pretty quick, and the staff members were excellent.  Everything seemed to be running smoothly, which was a relief on a Fish Fry Friday.  Overall, the whole place was unique, and the food was delicious.  As a first-timer, I was impressed, and we plan on taking some family their soon!"}
{"text":"The best place for fish fry but on a few times the staff has been rude and rushes people out too fast.  The food is great though so that makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great Fish Fry! Try the Parmesan potatoes, you will not be disappointing. Very affordable fish fry, great atmosphere and service. We tried the pudding for desert which was also delicious! We will be returning and recommending our friends. There are two restaurants, but on Fridays both serve the fish fry. The bar doesn't take reservations and is first come first serve. Usually a 30 min wait, so grab a beer! If you don't want to wait jump over the house and there usually is seating available. We are hoping to experience the barn next time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Quivey's Grove. Their pretzel crusted perch is one of my favorite meals, and their warm cider is delicious. Hits the spot! The atmosphere is cozy and fun in the barn."}
{"text":"When you find a place that has both a great atmosphere and terrific food, you've got a winner. When you add in great wait staff , it's a home run. Quivey's Grove is a home run. We stopped by on Labor Day weekend hoping to be far enough out of Madison to miss the crowds.  We arrived to find the place set up for a wedding and looking beautiful. We were afraid we might not be able to get lunch, but no problem. Lunch was being served. The wedding was taking place in the evening, and there was an air of excitement.  Our waitress was great. She went over the menu making some recommendations which we promptly ignored going for the pork shark lollipops and fried chicken dinner. Both were wonderful with the lollipops edging out the fried chicken by just a bit. Those shanks were glistening. They were moist, tender, and just darn yummy. They had a lot of meat on them and came on some really good smashed potatoes. The fried chicken came with more potatoes, some gravy and a bit of greenery. The chicken was crispy and juicy and  tasted like your grandma just made it in her big ole skillet.   Everything at Quivey's comes across as authentic . The staff is friendly, and I have a feeling that the colors will be beautiful if you go there in the fall."}
{"text":"We hosted our son's rehearsal dinner here in May. Quiveys never disappoints. The meals and service were outstanding. And who doesn't love the amazing fruit crisp for dessert. We had a private room for our group of 30 and were able to give speeches, distribute gifts, and start the wedding celebration for our kids in an awesome way. Thanks for making this event wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is good! It has a lot of potential to be a hip place but they don't take it to that level. I think even adding fun music in the bar area. Best cosmos around tho!"}
{"text":"I started out with the bartender recommended Corbel Old Fashioned. It was fantastic. I decided not to wait for a table in the dining area and ordered a few appetizers. I had cheese curds and smoked trout, both were good. The curds were cooked perfectly and the trout was a nice flavor. I do not understand why the restaurant menu is not served at the bar. I herd at least 5 people ask for it. The couple next to me left due to the long wait for a table. They told the bar tender they would have gladly had dinner at the bar. He said he knows its a problem and would let management know the need for it. Other than the lack of food choice at the bar, this is a great yelp find."}
{"text":"Excellent food in a great setting. People in our party had the steak, trout, chicken, duck and veal. All were superb. Great vegetables. Great service. And the tunnel to the bar always makes for a fun trip."}
{"text":"Food was fine. Bar prices outrageous!  8 for old fashion?  Last I knew this is wisconsin!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food and service is always top notch.  Tonight I had the chicken tenders and fried pickles.  Just the right amount of food and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food but i felt like i was in the movie Fargo when talking to our waitress. Pretty dense and service was so so.   Probably wouldn't go back with too many other choices around. Be prepared to have 20% tip added to your bill whether you are alone or in a party of 6.  Last time i ate in the stable,  the waitress there was a bit bitchy but the burger made the experience tolerable"}
{"text":"I was cranky and hungry when I walked in.  I groaned. The restaurant appears to be a pre-Victorian house converted into a restaurant.  It's an odd clash of pretentiousness and hominess. Not my usual fare.  But hunger and the fact I brought guests with me convinced me to sit down anyway.  I'm so glad we did.  The menu was short (a good thing) and even though the items seemed a bit odd (to me), the food was absolutely amazing.  I don't give 5-star ratings.  This food was better than 5-star.  The waiter, who's name might have been Erik, was perfect.    The hot cranberry muffins that were a precursor to the meal should be more coveted than Helen of Troy.  I don't normally care for muffins.  I could lock myself in a room with nothing but those muffins for the rest of my life and die happy!  The rest of the meal was as good.  My tablemates and I hatched a plan to kidnap the chef and make them cook for us forever.    As we pondered dessert, Erik came back with a second helping of the muffins... may you be forever blessed.  The bill was a bit higher than I normally pay for dinner, but I'd happily skip two meals somewhere else and come back for the exceptional food and service at Quivey's Grove."}
{"text":"Went to the Stone House and really enjoyed ourselves!  A little slow on the service, but hey, what's the hurry?!  We dined on a great bottle of wine, fairly priced, and we ate the Madison mushroom app, tried the smoked trout and braised short ribs entree's.  All of which were full of flavor and true to their claim of using local 'Wisconsin' recipes.  The place has a great atmosphere and really does take their diners back to a time when this area was still just farm land.  The only issue was the food was quite rich and I'd normally complain about the somewhat slow service but perhaps we should be more patient and try to slow down a bit."}
{"text":"My girlfriend's family was visiting from Milwaukee. They wanted to go out for a nice dinner that would be suitable for Grandpa and a celiac diet.  We decided on the Stable Grill. It was the perfect choice.  Before dinner we all had a few of their famous old fashioneds.  Korbel is their rail brandy so you know they are going to be good.    Her dad loved the meatloaf. It had a mushroom sauce that he raved about.  I had the ribs which were solid.  They came with these buttered red potatoes that were simple but delicious.  My GF had the perch which she thought were some of the best she's had.  The Stable's ambiance is quite remarkable.  It is basically an old stable fitted with a full bar and dining room.  Old wood floor, rock walls, a huge barn door and rickety stairs leading to a second floor. A lot of trendy places aim for the kind of ambiance the stable offers but you cant duplicate authenticity.  All in all this is a supper club style dining experience in a cool old time setting.  If you are looking to try something off the beaten path and are tired of sweet potato fries, trendy aiolis, beet salads or whatever the latest foodie flavor is this week, the Stable Grill at Quiveys Grove is just right."}
{"text":"I would not come back to this restaurant. The food was decent and the service was fine. I would not come back due to our waitress (Debbie), waiting till the end of our meal after we had already paid and tipped, to ask us how we felt about her service. We told her it was fine and she said \"Well I don't feel like your tip adequately reflects that\" and then left afterwards. We left immediately and discussed afterwards that everyone tipped 20% or more.  I won't be coming back.  Edit: Spoke to the manager. Issue has been resolved."}
{"text":"Atmosphere of stable pub is awesome and food has been really good! Also ordered for pickup and they were pretty quick would recommend"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend during Restaurant Week. We ate lunch in the stable and not the main house (or whatever they call it). I think the main house is for dinner only, but I could be making that up. We shared the burger and the fried fish. I was absolutely blown away. After basking in the golden glow of this exquisite beer-battered fish soaked in malt vinegar (because how else would you do it?!), I had some of the burger. Any burger with barbecue sauce and onion rings on it is sure to be good, but this one was phenomenal. They make the barbecue sauce in-house (as well as everything else, far as I can tell) and lay it on thick. Dessert was a blur of sugary bliss. Their turtle pie is amazing!  If you haven't been to Quivey's, I strongly encourage you to go because it's really a gem."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The food is so good! I recommend the pretzel crusted perch. I also really like how the menu items reflect Wisconsin geography and history. The barn is extremely cozy. Just makes for a great night out!"}
{"text":"Going back to Madison after a ten year absence, Quivey Grove stable is the go to for a Wisconsin fish fry.  Always good. Creamy cole slaw , sour dough bread, Parmesan potatoes(or fries) cod either beer battered or baked and lake perch is on the menus Wednesday and Friday. sweet!   Order an old fashion and you will be in Wiso fish fry heaven."}
{"text":"What a disappointing burger! I ordered their Kobe beef burger. I should have suspected something when the menu said it had mayo and BBQ sauce on it (it was also priced low for Kobe beef). For good beef like Kobe you do not want to hide the flavor of the beef. I ordered it with no mayo and no BBQ sauce, cooked medium rare with a side of their smashed potatoes. The burger was over cooked (if you are not going to deliver the patron the food as ordered than why ask them) and not Kobe beef. I suspect it was just regular beef. The smashed potatoes were bland as well. My wife ordered the \"Fitchburger\" cooked medium well with the smashed potatoes as her side. While her burger was cooked to order it was bland. She also found her potatoes to be bland so it was not just me. This place received two stars because we only tried their burgers and the place is quite charming as it is in an old barn. In short, were are not sure if we will be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Good, hearty, Wisconsin fare. I've eaten more at the Stone House and it's definitely a cut above the Stable Grill. My favorite dish at the Stone House (and one of my favorites in Madison) is the Pork Goodall: tender pork, a delicious apple butter cream sauce, roasted apple chunks, and sweet potato hash browns (with bacon, black walnuts, and brandy...absolutely amazing)."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is definitely the coolest part about going to dinner here--the stone house is beautiful and the stable is so interesting!  However, I've been unimpressed by their food. It's just... Okay. Wholesome Wisconsin food. Their fish fry is supposedly good, their other food is fine, but it's nothing to write home about. This is the place I go to when I want to do something outside the norm in terms of the location, but I wouldn't go specifically for the noms."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Very limited menu.  Atmosphere totally not MY thing.  Seemed a little pricey.  Bread before dinner were cinnamon muffins, I prefer a loaf of white bread, I ordered steak which was really good, and it was served on hash browns which were very good, with some crazy vegetables I of course didn't eat.  No salads are served here either before the main entree.  Despite the food being good, this is probably not a place I would return to.  We ate at the stone house part - the other part which has a grill has more sandwichey types of foods versus Entrées......................."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come for fish fry (fish and chips to anyone outside of the Midwest).  There's not one thing I dislike about this dish here.  Perfectly battered cod with a crispy outside and moist flaky center, perfectly cooked and seasoned fries, and a great tarter sauce (so often overlooked).  It is all you can eat which includes both the fries and the cod.  There's no reason you should leave this place hungry.   One plate is usually enough anyways.   If you like the Friday fish fry but want to avoid the crowd I would suggest visiting Quivey's on a Wednesday.  They offer the same all you can eat special for both lunch and dinner but without the hour and a half wait.    So about the service.  The last few times I've been here the service has been great.   Unfortunately this hasn't always been the case, and I've known others that have had a similar experience.  I hope things have turned around.  I really enjoy dinning here and for a time the food was the only thing I found exceptional."}
{"text":"I just don't get it.  I read all these reviews and I was expecting some delicious dinner.  Instead what I got was what could be found in any kitchen in the county.  Under-seasoned and over-cooked meat and potatoes.  Obviously Quivey's Grove really DOES cater to the midwestern palate."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! The Stable has wonderful ambiance, great menu (which is different from that of the House), large bar area with big varieties of beers, wines, cocktails. Friendly, engaging wait staff. And the food is terrific. Previous reviewer was right...the fried cod is SO good...as is the perch. The pork plate has ribs, pork shank and a big piece of sausage over sauerkraut with potatoes...yummy! The beef medallions were done well, wonderful sauce. Soup of the day was fish chowder...possibly the best I've eaten, and the citrus vignairette on the salad was delightfully fresh. Want to go back to try the house selections. Oh yes, they also had a large tent set up with tables for enjoying outdoor dining. This would be a fun place to look around while you wait, if you must wait. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Madison for a few years and I have heard nothing but good things about Quivey's. I can not help but be completely underwhelmed. I ate in the Stone House because it takes reservations.   I ordered a pork dish. It is not on their menu online. I was intrigued by it because I had not seen it previously. It came with an apple cider cream sauce. The pork was wrapped in bacon. My dinner was $21.95. I was completely cheated. I was given two pieces of pork, smaller than a 50 cent piece. They were juicy with a great flavor. However, they were small bites. This was not a dinner portion. I was told my dinner was served with croquettes (plural). I received one. And it was cold. The largest portion to my plate was fried apple. It took up 50% of the plate. If I could have walked out, I would have. If this is what they call dinner, I would hate to see anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"So it was my first visit to Wisconsin and I wanted to try some good ol local dining... (Yea, I'm one of those EPIC people).  First of all, Quivey's is a 2 for 1.  2 restaurants in one.... AWESOME.  We walked in expecting to eat at the stable, but when we saw the menu for the stone house, we went there instead.  We took a trip through the underground tunnel to get from the stable to the house.. that was pretty cool.. It's a nice quaint little place.  Good service.  I had the chicken bond... DELICIOUS!  I recommend it.    In conclusion: cool spot, great service, very good food.  I'M IN!"}
{"text":"This place is great! We spent most of our visit at the Stable grill. They tout an amazing Old Fashioned and a good local beer selection. There was a bit of a wait but we made friends with people at the bar and their wonderful daughter gave us a tour of the place. The underground tunnel, wine cellar, and wine tasting room were super cool. It reminded me of our many vacations in South Carolina and suddenly I was on vacation miles away. The house was also neat; classically historic, like being transported back in time. We were seated and our server was extremely prompt. We ordered the fish fry. Our coleslaw and bread came out quickly. The bread tasted slightly like bacon-AMAZING! Fish came out equally as quick. It was hot and crispy. The bredding stuck and their tarter sauce appeared homemade. The parmesean potatoes were the best part of the meal, although in comparison to the mild fish, they almost seemed overly seasoned. Our meal did seem a little rushed but I understand their need to flip tables. All in all, it was a great experience, not just a meal. We will return!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The food wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. I guess my score of \"2\" reflects my disappointment in comparison to the high expectations that I had for this place, but the food is probably somewhere between 2 and 3 quality. The service was fine. I did love the physical space of the restaurant though."}
{"text":"I had not been to Quivey's for some time and we thought it would be a great place to visit with some friends so we went to the Stable Grill.  The service was great but the food was barely adequate.  Ok, so it is lunch, I get it, it isn't a gourmet meal.   But yet I paid 10 bucks expecting to get a decent sandwich and it was skimpy and nothing spectacular.   I was really hoping for it to be a really nice meal and planned on taking half home for later.  But it was so small that I ate the whole thing just to fill my stomach.     It wasn't just me either.   No one else said much about their meal either and two people said they were also unhappy and found their dishes to be simple and tasteless. This just goes to show you that a long time establishment with a good reputation can seriously let you down."}
{"text":"Quivey's Grove is definitely a nice Wisconsin experience. Their pretzel battered fish fry is phenomenal. Really everything else was ok, but the fish fry is the reason I would go back again.  The restaurant is adorable and is in a rustic stone house. Or you can eat at the stable. Either way, you're in for a treat. I've heard that they host some fantastic wine tastings. I may look into that for a future get together or birthday with friends.  I feel like this is a less well-know restaurant, at least for the average Madison diner. That said, it's crowded on Friday nights...plan ahead."}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere would recommend the perch and smashed potatoes are gooooooood!!!"}
{"text":"Was seated in the loft. Wait times between check ups from staff were 5 minutes too long. We found ourselves chilling without beer or water for about 10 minutes. Still, they are super nice and helpful.  I really dig the atmosphere of this place. Farmy. Oldtimey.   Our meal consisted of some of the most memorable in Madison so far. The chicken comes highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really want to love Quivey's fish fry, but I just can't honestly say that it's great. The fish is pretty tasty, but it's pretty mushy and greasy too.  For some reason, I love the bread you get at the beginning. Nothing really beats fresh, hot bread. This bread is soft and dense with a hard crust.  Aside from the fish fry, the food is pretty hit or miss. Frontier chicken is juicy and crispy, and it comes with these incredible rich and garlicy mashed potatoes. Their cheese curds, however, are very mediocre. They dont have a distinct texture or flavor; but they'll hit the spot if you need some curds.  The atmosphere is fun if you like barns. It's a fun theme, and it really makes you think of Wisconsin."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch in the stable grill section. Food was very okay. Service was okay. Overall, nothing noteworthy in a good or bad way. The cheese curds came with a house made mustard sauce, which was a weird (bad) combo. The place was cute, inside and out."}
{"text":"This was quite possibly the coolest fish fry I have ever been to! Setting is very rustic and quaint, and decor makes you feel like you're right at home. We had to wait over an hour to eat, but they had a tent and tables/chairs outside that you could take alcoholic beverages too which was nice. If it was colder the wait would have been pretty uncomfortable since the bar was very small and very crowded. Decent beer selection, all local which was nice.  We got seated about 15 minutes after the time we were quoted, which was slightly annoying since it had gotten cold but not terrible. We got the cheese curd appetizer and cod fish fry. The cheese curds were sub par, I've definitely had better in madison especially for 8 bucks for the app! The fish was completely worth the price and absolutely delicious as well!!! It was everything a WISCONSIN fish fry should be...beer battered, piping hot, seasoned, and makes you want to fall into a food coma. Service was just ok (slow, forgot sauces we asked for) but they were still REALLY busy. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just another amazing experience! Abby the best server was still working there, although we missed her tonight, and had someone else. Very busy as always; arrive early to avoid the hour wait....on the conservative side.... If you live in Madison & get to eat here, then you're lucky & I'm envious. If you're in business or visiting? Get to this restaurant right away! The best fish fry I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Who writes these 500 word reviews?  Take a course in editing!  Anyway, this place is very nice with comfortable decor, great staff, and fine food.  It's nice for lunch.  Watch out for Friday night.  It's busy so get there early or later."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary, which lands on St. Patty's Day, so to avoid the mayhem of Guinness chugging, we ate in the Stone House rather than the Stable Grill.   Sadly, the best part of my meal was the warm muffins that they serve in lieu of rolls(that day it was Irish Oatmeal and Raisin). They were so moist and yummy...but then it just went down from there. I chose one of the three meals they offer for around $17 that comes with a cup of soup and a glass of wine--which I have to admit is a nice price. The soupwas good, but the salad I had him order so we could trade was SWIMMING in low-quality blue cheese dressing. My chicken and biscuits were disappointing as well. The biscuit was overdone, and the rest was an over salted gelatinous...thing. He liked his pretzel crusted fish(perch, I think), but we both agreed that the Parmesan potato(a wad of cheesy hash browns) was undercooked, and cool in the middle. Hm. We were both glad we didn't get any of the pricier entrees, in case the quality was on the same level.   After our meal, we did go through the wine cave and tunnel to the Stable Grill and thought it would be a good place for drinks and apps.   All in all, not a place I'm going to be dropping my money at, though."}
{"text":"Great family experience. We are visiting from out of town and my brother's family loves not far. We scored a table outside and watched our younger kids play while enjoying drinks at the tables. The atmosphere is great indoors and outdoors. I grew up in Wisconsin and hadn't had a peri fish fry in decades. It was great to enjoy perch again in such a Wisconsin setting."}
{"text":"My favorite fish fry in Madison. Parmesan potato is the way to go for your side. Classic barn look that is so Wisconsin. You will not be disappointed. That fish fry in the stable grill with a brandy old fashioned...just perfection."}
{"text":"Great place and was very close to my hotel while on trip to Epic.  Everyone was super nice and the food and drinks were excellent.  I went to the stable several times."}
{"text":"This is supposed a taste of regional cuisine.  Um... OK.   Personally I was not super impressed.  I was told the soup of the day was chicken spaetzel, which sounded good so I ordered it.  When I received it I had a bowl of creamy ham and potato soup.  I ate about 4 bites before I realized it was completely wrong.  When the waitress came back and confirmed she had told us the wrong soup there was no offer to replace it with something else or an apology even.  At the very least I think it should have been taken off the bill since I stopped eating it once I realized it was wrong.  I don't even eat ham!  I ordered a fish dish off the menu (since there were no specials) and was pretty disappointed.  The cheesy potatoes with it were the most flavorful thing on the plate.  The asparagus was extremely thick, which I dislike, and there was 4 spears.  FOUR.    Also, my long island iced tea was completely watered down.  I guess 3 stars is being generous.  Oh well, I guess I am in a generous mood today!"}
{"text":"Went to the house part for restaurant week. The setting is unique. The food is about average, but perhaps it is a little overpriced for the portions received. Not bad, but I probably won't come back until my folks are in from out of town. I also want to try the grill part that is the barn. Maybe that's more my style."}
{"text":"Wonderful. Great food, excellent service and a quiet, romantic atmosphere.  We celebrated Valentines Day there."}
{"text":"It's a cool setting.  The barn is a 3 star fish fry at best, but the house is nicer and the food is closer to 4 stars.  I would limit the barn to an app and a beer..... maybe just a beer.... and eat in the house for dinner.  More expensive, but a better value."}
{"text":"Ok, I admit, I have a love affair with this place. I was first here back in 2007 and just loved the ambiance. Both times I was here, it was around the holiday season and they really deck the halls in a very traditional and festive manner.   The building is a historic landmark. There is the main house and then the old stable which has been converted into a charming bar and restaurant. I just feel so good every time I come here with all the stone work and old wood beams. The two story tall Xmas tree doesn't hurt either.  The food is decent. Some items are really good, others are ok, but nothing to write home about. The onion rings were quite tasty, the Lodi Sausage Sampler was good, though the potato salad was a tad bland. Christopher wasn't nuts about his Patty Melt, but I tried it and thought it was fine.  To be honest, I would probably come here even if the food was only ok across the boards. I just love being here because it reminds me of Christmas ... just like the ones I used to know. Hmmmmm, maybe I will be in trouble if I come here any time but the Holiday season. I'll ponder that one and get back to you."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is pretty cool. We at in the barn and it is rustic and very quaint. The initial greeting and seating was very quick and friendly. Our waitress came with water and menus right away. She came back to take our orders when we were ready. Then things slowed down to an uncomfortable pace. Our appetizers of onion rings and cheese curds came out before the drinks arrived or water refilled. Although both were tasty(I would recommend either) they would have been even better with the drinks which we were told were still coming because the bar tender had to make them.(we had 2 beers and a margarita)The drinks came just as we were finishing the apps and unfortunately quite a while before the meals came. The cheese sandwich and the mushroom burger were very good. The cod special had a good flavor, but it was drowning in so much grease that the fish was hard to find. We were asked if we wanted desert soon after we had finished, but the bill was presented after a long wait and my card wasn't picked up for another ten minutes after that."}
{"text":"First off, the location of this restaurant is great, being historically significant. You can sit outside, in the barn, or in the house. We sat in the top level of the barn and it was a great atmosphere. Outside is great too, I was there my first visit.  I got the beer-battered cod and thoroughly enjoyed it. Light breading and didn't taste overly fishy. Potatoes were good-tasting as well. Decent price for all of it.  Server was attentive and understood a little confusion we had, and also was very friendly. Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"As part of my ongoing search to find the best fish fry in Madison I found myself at Quivey's Grove for their famous fish fry.  I loved walking up to this place because you can tell just by looking at the building that there is a lot of history there.  The building is made out of brick and does not look like it has ever had a renovation; I mean this in the nicest possible way!  As I walked in I found myself kind of lost as there are many small rooms in this place.  After finally finding the hostess we were led to our table; I believe reservations are neccessary.  Our table was in one of the many small rooms with about four other tables.    The vibe of the place was lovely and intimate.  Upon sitting we took a look at the drink menu and both decided on the key lime martini; pretty good.  Our waitress was very friendly and answered all of our questions very graciously.  I ordered the all you can eat fish fry with the potato.  The cheesy potato was definitely the star of the show!  It was a shredded potato with cheese and it was fantastic!  The fish on the other hand was just okay.  It was beer battered which I am starting to discover is not something that I like.  The man ordered the fish platter with 3 different types of fish; baked, lightly battered, and beer battered.  He loved everything he had and also loved the potato.   All in all I am happy that I tried the fish fry here and while I may not be back for that specifically, I am looking forward to trying other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Delicious, locally-sourced food with a Wisconsin feel, served in an atmospheric setting by friendly, knowledgeable servers."}
{"text":"Highlights/Lowlights  1) great food 2) nice/unique ambience  3) friendly service  Quiveys Grove is so fun! Two different restaurants on the same property. One, the more casual \"Stable Grill\". The second, the more formal \"Stone House\".  We had the pleasure of dining at the Stone House tonight! You are quite literally eating in a stone house which makes the ambience really unique. I called ahead to confirm the time of our reservation (since I forgot oops!) and the lady on the phone was quite short and rude. However our server was SO friendly. She was attentive to our table and we didn't wait long for any of our courses. Quite honestly the courses almost came too quickly! I had taken the last bite of my soup when my entree showed up.   Menu items \"honored\" various people (Mostly Wisconsinites) which I found really clever! How often is it that you can say your dinner is in honor of Aldo Leopoldo for example? There was a spring cocktail menu which was appreciated. Always nice to see Wisco establishments embracing what little spring we have.   We had the cheese raven appetizer to start which is essentially Quivey's take on cheese fondue featuring locally sourced sausage. I had trout and he had the schnitzel for the main and neither of us left disappointed. The parm potato casserole side that came with mine ROCKED!   If you haven't been to Quivey's, stop by to one of there unique restaurants. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The consensus opinion among the eight people at our table is that Quivey's has the best Friday fish fry we've tried. It also has a really interesting ambiance, with a fun underground tunnel connecting the quieter, more formal seating in the Stone House to the more casual dining in the Stable Grill. For a night out with our family and a family of friends, it's a lot better to eat in the Stable Grill portion of the restaurant, rather than the (more formal) Stone House: the Stable is more suited to our boisterous group, but you'll still want to walk through the tunnel to the wine cave and the Stone House, just to look around if you have to wait for a table. (They do a brisk business, so it's best to call ahead.) Also, the cheese curds are only available in the Stable Grill portion (and the kids like these even better than the ones at The Old Fashioned, though the parents might split hairs on that one)."}
{"text":"Favorite place when near Madison,WI. Food is great and we had the Smoked Trout with garlic toasts as an Appetizer, followed by the  Monona Meatloaf, Kitty had the Roxbury Ribs. Almost forgot I had a cup of Creamed Asparagus which is the best I ever tasted."}
{"text":"The beautiful, rustic atmosphere of this restaurant makes it a wonderful dinner venue. The food is nothing spectacular, but still enjoyable. I particularly liked the cheese curds appetizer with the curried mustard! I ordered a steak for my entree and it was pretty good - I knew this wasn't a steakhouse so my expectations were not excessively high. My husband and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My benchmark for reviews.  You're given the choice between the main house or the stable - the former caters to an older crowd, the latter a younger one.  Try the stable first - bigger menu, more affordable prices.    The food: flavorgasm-inducing.  The service: friendly, prompt, and non-obtrusive.  The setting: interesting and relatively quiet.  They make a nice drink too.    On a Friday, try the combo plate of fish and thank me later.  Bacon-wrapped pork, beef medallions, meatloaf, chicken... I'm already looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"The Stable Grill is now one of my Madison favorites. We tried the smoked trout, cheese curds, fried perch, filet medallions, and the Cross Plains Chicken. All of the food was excellent and affordable. Love the stable feel of the dining room. Great local beer options on tap."}
{"text":"My daughter searched for farm to table restaurants and this came up. We ate at the Stable grill and it was good. The decor is rustic but nice. The food was very good and the prices are reasonable. The joy reason n for 4 stars is the entry's don't come with a vegetable. I had the meatloaf and smashed potatoes and they it was very good. Seemed it was missing a veggie though. I would go back Service was good too"}
{"text":"Quivey's Grove Stone House for a fish fry would not have been my first choice.  I've been to this location on a number of occasions, but never for the grandest of Wisconsin traditions.    Long story short, it will now be taken into consideration every Friday when fish is on my mind.  Not only was the fried Cod great, the parmesan potatoes are fantastic.    I will also recommend paying the extra $1.50 for a second plate."}
{"text":"Great food, keep in mind it's a family run affair. I want to preface this review by saying I'm a huge fan of this place. The Stone House may well be my favorite restaurant. That being said, I simply can't objectively give it 4 stars. It's not a professionally run restaurant. The food is generally great, the appetizer sampler is a must have. Entrees are mostly good, though there are some exceptions. This is the type of place you love for it's character and it's flaws, not despite them. Worth at least one visit, it may not be for everyone, but there is some fantastic food and atmosphere to be had."}
{"text":"Good food. Good drinks. Too bad there's always a long wait for fish on Friday. Their fish and chips are both very good, either fried or broiled. Love their fried mushrooms!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my experience here tonight.  The appetizers might have been good if they were not served cold.  The melted cheese appetizer was just a floppy  mess.  The trout cake had an off flavor.  The schnitzel was pretty good but this one bright spot was overshadowed by continuous bad service.  Slow to take orders, slow to deliver orders, not clearing dirty plates and a sincere but clueless attitude about what needed to be done in the dining room.  Sweet but unprofessional."}
{"text":"One of our staple places - just wish the wait wasn't so long on Friday nights.    Service could be better - the staff is short-witted and have a \"get the to point attitude - which is understandable given the popularity of this place.    I also wish they took reservations in the stable."}
{"text":"I prefer the Stable than the Stone House any day! A great place to grab a beer and burger with family or friends. The place gets packed though, so call ahead if you can. A nice variety of menu items for everyone."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with interesting decorations. I brought some family members  from out of town here because they were craving fish and nothing was a disappointment."}
{"text":"I get the Perch, its outstanding.  I'm from N.E. sconnie and the fish fry back home makes most Madison offerings look like Gorton's.  Not Quivey's though.  I also like the Meatloaf and the Beef medallions are outstanding as well.  The service is the issue at Quivey's. They won't let you eat at the bar or in the bar area for some reason and the bartenders are awkward at best, and DO NOT! ask to watch the badger hockey game while you wait for your table.  The price points are a little ridiculous as well. The aesthetic is great, really cool building"}
{"text":"Very cute little place hidden away. I adored the atmosphere and the decor, very homey. The old fashioned and bloody Mary's we had were fantastic and i loved the burger"}
{"text":"We went to the Stable Grille since the Stone House was closed for a catered event.  They did a really nice job with the interior of the barn.  They managed to keep it barn like but still work as a functioning restaurant.   The rest of our party seemed to enjoy their food, but I'm giving them four stars for the schnitzel alone.  I lived in Germany for a while, and schnitzel was one of my restaurant staples.  And they got it almost exactly right.  It could have been a little thinner, but it was breaded and cooked perfectly and the smell and flavor was dead-on.  I was very impressed.  The twice baked cheese potato was a nice side as well."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I've only had the fish fry.   Came here on a Friday at around 5:45pm with a group of 6. We waited about 1.5hrs before being seated, which I gathered is standard for a Friday night here. We were at the Stable Grill. We hung out at the bar and got some beers while we waited. The selection of beers on tap was decent, though I did go during Craft Beer Week so that might not be typical.  Our whole group ordered the Beer Battered Cod Fish Fry. It came with cole slaw, bread, 3-4 moderate pieces of cod, and a choice of fries or parmesan potatoes. We all got the parmesan potatoes, so I can't comment on the fries. I'm not a fan of mayo-based cole slaw, which this was, so I can't really comment on how good it was. The cod was delicious! Flavorful, crispy, and flaky...the best fish fry I've had in Madison so far (I've only had it at a few places, fyi). I especially liked the potatoes. They were grated and formed into a rectangular stack with parmesan coating the potatoes to create a gooey, irresistible hash brown-like dish.   The service was good, our waitress was nice and very attentive. She came by often and kept us updated on the status of our meals (which came very quickly!).  I would come back for the fish fry, and I'm curious to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you ever live anywhere near Madison, you need to go to this place.  The bar in the stable serves drinks strong and perfectly poured.  Literally anything off the menu is going to burst with flavor.  The Stone House and the Stable Grill both offer really cool experiences; be sure to take a walk through the cool tunnel that serves as a wine cellar and connects the two.  I think Quivey's Grove is best enjoyed when you're planning to spend an hour or so at the bar waiting for a table, preferably on one of those cold winter nights where it's so brutal that you can't stand the walk from the car to the restaurant door.  Quivey's practically exists to keep you warm."}
{"text":"Restaurant Week once again.  And that brings me back to the good ole Stable for lunch.  The service here has never disappointed me, and if you've read my other reviews, you know I am big on service. Our food has always been great as well.  This time, we started with the potato puffs, nice and cheesy, and the Wisconsin Beer and Cheese soup, nice and beery and cheesy. Both very good. If you're Wisconsin foodie, this is a soup for you.  My girlfriend barely got a taste.  It's homemade and oh so good.  Main courses were Pork Lollipops, almost like ribs, and the Kobe Beef Bacon Cheddar Burger.  Neither of us shared. They were that good!  The pork was falling off the bone and shredding without effort.  And the BBQ sauce, which was on the burger as well, had a great flavor with a nice little spice to it.  The burger is the reason I keep coming back.  Between the meat the nearly melts in your mouth and the aged Wisconsin cheddar melted on top, who would need anything else? But, there is still the BACON and BBQ Sauce, both adding into it.  If you've ever had a meal that made you feel like you were on a cloud, you know how I felt.  I can't say enough about this.  I have never had a better burger... EVER!  Maybe it's the high quality meat, maybe it's the spectacular local cheese.  I don't care, TRY IT!  Desserts were a brownie sundae and a turtle pie.  Brownie sundaes aren't anything new, but this was all you could ask for in one.  It had the right amount of warmth in the brownie, not so hot the ice cream melted, but warm enough that it just melted in your mouth.  And the turtle pie was good helping of a fluffy chocolate cream on a crispy crust that was layered with pecans, all in a bed of caramel sauce.  It was light, airy, and very chocolatey.  I could have eaten far more cream than I was given.  I definitely recommend this place.  The atmosphere is nice and cozy.  I grew up with a farming family, so being in a barn-like dining area was nice and reminiscent.  This place is popular enough that I've seen chefs and owners of other local restaurants in it as well.  I don't give out 5 stars often, but this place has earned it."}
{"text":"Holiday decor created a great atmosphere. Jolly Rancher martini, cheese curds and fried pickles were tasty starters, but everything else was kind of bland. I had the fried chicken and my coworker had the BBQ ribs, both served with smashed potatoes. My chicken needed a little seasoning/spice, and so did my coworker's ribs, which I tasted. In spite of this, the service was great and I'd probably come back  (with a bottle of hot sauce to zest up my food)."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, the atmosphere and the food was awesome. They were so busy when I went so we just waited had a few drinks at the bar. The buffalo head did kinda freak me out but besides that it was a great experience."}
{"text":"The environment here awesome. The ribs are the best with the parm potatoes to die for. The cheese curds is a separate conversation. They are wonderful with the mustard sauce! Got to love the cheese...."}
{"text":"This is the place I tell people to come for authentic Wisconsin food that doesn't pride itself on deep fried food.  Highly recommend it, very cool atmosphere in an old farm house. Good wait staff, great menu. I suggest you try something out of your comfort zone, there is no wrong choice. You'll be Happy you tried something new.  Drink are great, of course you can't go wrong with a brandy old fashion."}
{"text":"It is the only restaurant in the area where you can bring a visitor to sample regional cuisine. Almost everything else is a transplant or a chain. We have visited for 25 years and will continue. Our son and many of our friends children have had their wedding receptions at Quivey's. The repertoire is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is almost five stars for me.  I love the old time feel, complete with underground milking tunnel connecting the two buildings.   The hand muddled Korbel old fashions are perfect!  I had the fish combo (available Wed or Fri) with the cheesy potatoes,  a must.  Combo comes with baked and fried cod and fried perch. Plus slaw and all the bread you like. Save the sub-par service we had while dinning, this place is great!"}
{"text":"The Quivey's Grove Stone House is a great option for date night. The lighting in low, the tables are spaced well and the low noise level promotes conversation. I enjoyed the traditional Wisconsin (German) food despite it being very rich. Expect to eat a nice, slow meal with multiple courses. The only set back is the wine/beer list, short and not often modified. I'd recommend reservations as the restaurant is small and a popular site for private parties. I also recommend their lamb dish.   The service in the Stable Grille is a step down from that in the Stone House. The bar area is relaxed but small. The bartenders are average. The dining area is unique, with a picnic table style set up. I wasn't terribly impressed by their \"Middleton Perch\" or \"Marxville Chicken.\"  Stone House = 4 stars Stable Grille = 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great good and nice outside views. Definitely has the wedding venue vibe. Fried pickles and fried perch were amazing. Nice all around place to eat. Felt price was very reasonable compared to quality and quantity of food received. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Ate dinner at the Stone House tonight. It was our first visit and we took our young kids with. Food was very good-prime rib and lamb both cooked exactly as we asked. The homemade bread was excellent and the libations were well executed. Service was pretty good but she seemed overwhelmed at times. All in all a solidly good meal in beautiful ambience at Christmastime."}
{"text":"Lunch in the stable bar on a weekday (main house is closed then).  Superb fish chowder.  Mostly fish and fishy things!   Most chowders people rave about are vehicles for the consumption of sweet cream - - so very, very rich, and palate pleasing, but mostly cream and potatoes.  The chowder here was a genuine fish stew, with a light milk base.  A cup was plenty, and a super value at about $4.  The others had the fish fry, which looked gorgeous, and they were impressed overall.  Very good kitchen, turning out tasty meals with standard American big portions.  Very, very good value at lunch."}
{"text":"Eat at Stone House!  The food was fantastic, great service, nice atmosphere and a great value, 3 amazing courses for $27!  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We've been going to Quiveys Grove for a while now, since I was in high school. Its a neat place to go to and I love the atmosphere. The restaurant is in a converted barn and there is an upstairs which is fun to dine in. It use to be you would come for the food as well as the atmosphere now it's mostly atmosphere for us.  The food used to be really outstanding but now it's just OK. All their menu items are named after Wisconsin cities which is kinda cool. The menu is kinda small but I think they have a variety for everyone; sandwiches, fish, beef, chicken, etc. Portions seem kinda small and I wouldn't get their specials. Every time I do it doesn't seem put together very well and like they might just be trying to get rid of stuff. I got the salmon with beef tip special last time, the salmon was dry and the beef was doused in a heavy cream sauce. The food can be good just not stand out to make us wanna come here often. I like their bar though and if you like Martinis they have a happy hour where their half off. They also make good drinks and the bartenders are always nice."}
{"text":"My number ONE choice for Friday (or Wednesday) fish fry in Madison.   There are  two separate restaurants at Quiveys Grove, and I always choose the more casual Stable Grill. Yes, it truly was originally a stable, and I love the old world barn feel.   Go early on Fridays or you will certainly have to wait. Luckily the bar area is quite large and inviting and serve up tons of Wisconsin beers.  In the summer, the outside covered dining area relieves some of the congestion....plus it's pleasant out there!  All Friday fish choices are delicious, but their pretzel coated perch is my favorite.   I just wish Quivey's offered other no-charge veggie choices for folks that are avoiding potatoes. I find their extra charge for substituting veggies excessive.  If you can eat potatoes: try their signature 'parmesan potatoes'. It's a delicious baked cheesey potatoes dish served by the square. So yummy.  Quiveys is a MUST TRY for Friday Fish!"}
{"text":"The baked cod was super overcooked.  I don't consider myself a fish connoisseur, but even I could tell that this fish was not cooked properly.  The battered cod however was impressionable.  There is always the fear that beer battered foods will be too greasy.  I didn't get that at all from the fish.  Also, the waiter kept talking about how great the potato is, but to be honest, it tasted as if they had just heated it up...not cool.  Although, everything was reasonably priced and the service was decent, I am still not sure if I will be returning.  Then again, I love to forgive and forget."}
{"text":"I was here last night for drinks. The stable grill has an awesome atmosphere, with a lot of the original stone walls in the stable and original columns too. The entire ambiance is awesome, it's super cozy and comfortable. They don't have a great beer selection on tap, which is a little disappointing as they have a pretty solid bar area in the restaurant. I would go again, though."}
{"text":"Check out the Stable Grill for some classic Wisconsin cooking.  Excellent beer selection and filling dinners.  All in what's basically a fancied-up barn.  And unless she's chatting about her 4H days, probably not a great date place.  The fish fry is really outstanding. Skip the fries and get the parmesan potatoes. However, any other day of the week, the food, while good, is forgettable."}
{"text":"First and foremost-excellent service from the bartender to our waitstaff. Second, if you have never tried fried pickles I highly recommend you try Quivey's Grove fried pickles.  The pickles are lightly battered and comes with light horseradish dipping sauce.  Watch out with first bite as the light batter disguises a very hot thin spear shaped pickle that escapes its batter cover and into your mouth.  Yummy. Next pickle chomp on it to get the full texture of the pickle meshed with the batter.  It is good with it without the horseradish dipping sauce.  We ordered Middleton's Perch Fish which is presented with French fries or Parmesan potatoes.  You will receive 5 perch filets.  We did not know until after dinner that the Friday nite fish fry options included baked cod; fried cod; and or platter that includes 2 perch fillets, 2 baked cod and 1 fried cod that you can split.   I usually have fried cod as a fish & chips.  I was not disappointed with the fried perch and would order again.  I forgot to mention the slaw which was very tasty.  Sad part I did not have room for dessert. I was eyeing either the cobbler or hot fudge sundae.  Finally the bartender made great drinks.  Try the rum punch.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"I liked this place when I lived in the Madison area. I recently inquired about rehearsal dinner - asked if they were available for a certain date. They responded with one sentence saying they don't do group dinners in [this building], but that they do them in [that building]. Didn't even answer the question. Really poor customer service. Rehearsal dinner being booked elsewhere."}
