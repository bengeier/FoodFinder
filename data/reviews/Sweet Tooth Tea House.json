{"text":"We ran in here to escape the rain recently, and I'm so glad we did!

It's a totally strange, hybrid kind of a spot. It looks for all the world like a classic, pleasant downtown cafe/bakery kind of place, with a really lovely chalkboard menu and tons of beverage options. But then under the glass, instead of being Starbucks, you're suddenly in Europe, with flan and Portuguese tarts and rice pudding and... beer? Plus there seems to be a full lunch and dinner menu.

I had a chai latte, which was delicious and very reasonably priced, and a slice of flan, which I really geeked out over because, I mean, where can you just have a delicious slice of fresh flan? That never happens to me. So happy.

The only thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars is that it was not full of happy people, which it totally deserves to be."}
{"text":"Very nice place. They also have a variety of Portuguese food items as well. I love their flan and Portuguese rice pudding. So yummy. I love their tea selections as well. It is a perfect place to meet friends for coffee or a quick bite to eat. There are some vegetarian options for sandwiches which I love. It is worth a visit. The prices are also reasonable. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wanted to go... Went.... Regretted it.

Went for a coffee/breakfast with my girlfriend. Very disappointed, we were excited to try it and it let us down in all respects.

Service: the server, he did not speak much English, got our orders wrong. 

Quality: London fog, there was no foam at all...zero, and tasted like dishwater.

Mocha, okay, no foam or types of milk to select from.

Sandwich; egg and ham, egg tasted like it was frozen, very very blandwich, 

Also we ordered a tomato avocado sandwich but got two egg and ham.

Cookies: rock hard, couldn't break them with my hands. Very very stale/old.

Overall we were so disappointed, we wanted to love it as we live right here.

There are just so many places that do everything so much better ."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a homemade food experience, this is the place to go.  Portuguese cuisine, amazing flans, cheesecakes.  Fully licensed and great experience.  I find the people that have made poor reviews just enjoy making poor reviews, and have no idea what they are talking about"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to stop by this attractively appointed tea house but had never gotten around to it. Well I must emphatically say: Boy what I have been missing! Located in the rough-around-the edges neighborhood of St. Clair Gardens/Carleton Village, Sweet Tooth Tea House is a diamond in the rough . They have a full lunch and dinner menu. And if you are in the mood to imbibe, they have a full selection of various wines. 

I tried the grilled goat cheese sandwich and it was fantastic. It was made on a freshly baked crusty type roll and then pressed to a crunchy perfection (there goes my low carb diet!). Oh, and don't be fooled by the name, not only do they serve tea, they sell awesome coffee beverages as well! I recommend the latte. 

In summary, this place has it all: excellent food, great service and a nice chill vibe. If you are in the neighbourhood, check them out. And even if you are not in the neighbourhood check them out; you won't be disappointed."}
