{"text":"In my honest opinion, this is one of the best filipino restaurant in the GTA. They also have the best and my personal favorite SISIG.  I live in Oshawa and still drive here for their dish."}
{"text":"Oh God! I am from Montreal and Ellen's Place Restaurant is a must stop if in Mississauga. I am definitely making this a permanent place to get my Filipino dishes. Service fast and very friendly. Sisig is my favorite dish but everything is so flavourful!"}
{"text":"I revisited this restaurant 2 days ago to check out if it would be a nice setting for a dinner with my fiancé's family and mine on the weekend. I had been here a couple times before but it was my fiancé's first time. We're both Filipino and wanted to have a Filipino restaurant dinner. I wanted to visit before making reservations because the last time I had been there was several years ago and I remembered the food being good but the setting being very dark. It was actually exactly like I remembered.   First, as we walked towards the entrance, there was a very unappealing and overflowing cigarette disposal beside the door. It looks and smells really gross, which is a turn off for me before going into a restaurant. The inside was very dark. There are some nice booths with wicker or bamboo decor which are nice, very Filipino looking, but again still very dim lighting with all the lights on. It makes for a nice bar and lounge setting which I didn't mind when I had been there with friends, but I didn't feel like I wanted to take our parents there for a nice sit down dinner.   We may still have considered the place for a casual dinner, but I wasn't too impressed by the worker/owner that served us. We decided to get take out since we were already there but the guy made me feel like I was bothering him. My fiancé and I did arrive at the restaurant 15 minutes before it opened (we didn't know what their hours were before arriving) but the door was open and we walked in. The guy didn't really greet us. I asked for a take out menu and he just handed me a menu and walked away without saying anything. For the service industry, you'd think it's common sense to make your customers feel like their business is appreciated. I'm not asking for grand gestures, but simply saying \"Let me know if you need anything else or ready to order\" or even just a smile would have made all the difference.   When I walked up to the register to order, he was talking to someone and jokingly swearing. This didn't bother me, but I know it can offend some other people because it's not professional in front of customers you don't know. When he took my order, I asked how long it would take and he said \"We're not even open yet. It will be awhile because we open at 5pm and will take 15-20 minutes to cook.\" He should have told me that before I ordered, preferably when he handed me the menu. He wasn't necessarily very rude, but he always spoke to me in a way that made me feel like I was inconveniencing him. I also felt like I was getting an annoyed tone like he's thinking \"Duh... We don't open til 5pm and you should know this! So don't ask me how long it will take!\"   Anyway, the food was ready by 5:15pm think. It didn't feel like it took too long but my fiancé and I were chatting anyway. When the food was ready, he came out and left it on a table furthest away from us. It just seemed so weird he couldn't bother to walk over and hand it to us. We didn't hear any thank you or anything. After he left the food he disappeared. My fiancé wasn't impressed with the attitude and decided we wouldn't have dinner there.   Regarding the food, we ordered a serving of Crispy Pata. It was $10.75 + tax. The serving size was fair and we enjoyed eating it when we got home. It was pretty good and comparable to other crispy pata I've ordered elsewhere. My mom had some and she rates it as only ok.   Overall, I may go to the restaurant in the future if I was really craving Filipino food, my mom was too tired to cook, and there was no other restaurant to choose from. It's now pretty low on my list of Filipino restaurants to go to but I wouldn't exclude it because there isn't enough Filipino restaurants in the Brampton/Mississauga area.   Would love to get to know some of the better Filipino restaurants in the area to try next."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review on behalf of my mum because she does not have a Yelp! account, however, I was present when she purchased an order of sisig from this place.  Prior to picking up her order, my mum called the restaurant to determine cost and when the order would be made available. The menu for take-out had a footnote essentially indicating that prices may vary. Sure-- that applies to seasonal ingredients such as exotic fruits or rare cuts of meat -- but I wasn't sure why this was necessary for an order of sisig. Regardless, my mum was informed that the order was ready and quoted her the price (9$ for a regular).  Upon arrival, the sisig wasn't even close to being cooked AND when it was finally ready -- she charged almost 15$ than the price she was originally quoted! Not to mention, the size of the \"regular\" was not even worth the extra 4$."}
{"text":"I had the worst service ever at this restaurant. Okay I went in last night and placed my order to go. So after waiting for 35 mins without hearing anything about my order, I stood up and ask for my order.  The guy, guessing the owner, talked to me and this was our conversation: Me:  Hi, wondering if my order is ready coz I had been waiting for about half an hour now. Owner:  Oh, sorry but you have to wait for another 15-20 mins as we have run out of steam rice. Me:  What!  I still have to wait for another 20 mins just for the rice and after 35 mins u just telling me now. Owner:  Well,  I can reimburse u for the rice as I have run out of it and can't serve you unless you wait. Me:  I have been seeing you guys sending out rice to the diners and your telling me you have run out of rice. Owner:  They pre-ordered it yesterday. Me:  You could have told me in the beginning that I have to wait for so long! Owner:  Tell me if you don't want it or you want to wait.  Don't give me hard time! Me:  Okay, I guess I don't have a choice coz I need the rice for the other food I ordered. I will wait. Owner: The 15-20 mins is still not guaranteed. Me yelling:  WHAT!!! Fine give me my money back and I will blog you!!! This place is willing to lose me than to please me.  I guess coz my order is nothing compare to the large group(party).  What a total jerk!!!"}
{"text":"My gf and I decided to come here after Eastgate Mall, since it's along the way. For those planning on going to Ellen's Place, it's by the intersection of Tomken & Kamato. Even when we used the GPS, it led us to another destination. Luckily, we've been there before, but with our families being the ones that drove, we had a sense of remembering our surroundings. We went on Matheson instead and eventually found our destination. Don't be fooled: It's tucked in a \"business\"-like plaza. I'm stating this, so whoever's reading this, doesn't get lost like we did.  With being Filipino-Canadian, I'm familiar with the type of food they serve here. We've been here only a couple times with our families. My aunt knows the owners of this restaurant, for she went to school with Ellen. So, needless to say, we got great service and great food every time. But this is the first time we've been here without our families and sadly, it's the exact opposite. We solely came here for the pork sisig. Quite honestly, I've only tried sisig from here and LaMesa (But theirs isn't traditional sisig, it's their own version of sisig with a twist). So I can't compare it with any other place, but regardless, their sisig is top notch. Comes to you on a sizzling pan, which you can hear from a mile away. Keep in mind that despite the sisig being on the appetizer menu, it's pretty big. We only got that and an order of garlic fried rice. We took it home, because we couldn't finish it.  We went there at 5pm on a Saturday. Which is quite possibly their busiest night of the week. Because they have a band performing and have karaoke as well. If I'm not mistaken, they have karaoke every night at 9pm. We were the first ones to get there. Waitress gave drinks and took our order right away. Shortly after she took our order, more people started filling up tables. There were a couple 4 top tables and 2 big groups of people that came in within an hour timeframe. As people have stated, Filipino food takes awhile to make, so patience is key. Which my gf and I have a lot of. But they tested it that night. We got our food, ate and enjoyed it. We both work in Food Service and know how busy it can be. But how their service is managed is poor. From 5pm-7pm there was only ONE waitress serving all the aforementioned tables. I was watching her and she was cool & calm. But she had no help from the owners, whatsoever. I only saw the two owners when they went to talk to the guests. Only once has one of the owner's lifted a dish to serve to a table. Ridiculous. We don't know what was happening in the kitchen. Maybe they were short staff. Who knows. We started to get impatient, because we were waiting an hour just for someone to clear our plates and give us dessert (We ordered the Halo Halo). At 7pm, two more waitresses showed up and started serving the big groups first, rather than the tables of 4 that came in before them. The waitresses cleared all of the dishes from the big groups, before clearing everyone else's. Maybe they do this, because they're in a big group and expect a big tip. At this point, we've decided to cancel the Halo Halo order and go to Bubble Republic for bubble tea instead. Because we didn't want to wait any longer. But shortly thereafter, she comes along with the Halo Halo and apologizes for the wait. We quickly ask for takeout containers for our food and the bill. Luckily, we had cash on us, so we didn't have to wait for anyone. But what baffles me, is I'm looking through the bill and they charge for gratuity! For 2 people! It's ridiculous, especially when the service was lacking attention. With my restaurant-going experience, I only know restaurants charge for gratuity when it's a large party. There were only 2 of us. We dropped the cash and walked out. The food was great, but the service needs working on. Our waitress did her best and was apologetic, but they need more help and a tad bit of common sense with who to serve first.  I'll definitely be coming back, but going to call ahead and order takeout. No way am I making the same mistake."}
{"text":"Note that this is a Filipino spot in its truest form. True in a sense that it transforms into a karaoke/drinking place in the evening. Since I do neither, I can just comment on the food.  Food was pretty good, similar to how I would rate Casa Manila except that the sizzling sisig I found to be inferior. Note that good sisig is important in a Filipino restaurant. They put a lot of mayonnaise in it which I've seen some places do in the Philippines though very rarely (It's a common ingredient but should be barely noticeable when served). Strangely, some people actually prefer this. I guess minced pig parts, fat and all, doesn't give you a stroke fast enough so what more efficient way than to add a tub of mayo to kick it up notch. While were at it, let's top it off with an egg yolk (by the way, its not uncommon to top sisig with an egg). It is the perfect cardiac delight.  This place also adds a 15% tip automatically to the meal which is kind of a turnoff. Though i'd visit this place again if any cravings popup."}
{"text":"The only place I've ever been to for Philipino food. I'd probably even go back if I don't find anything better. The service is slow but the food was pretty good. Finer details:  Ambience: Cozy, homely, the left and right wing of the restaurant are better seating spots than the center (in everyone's way).  Crowd: Philipinos, big surprise!  Variety: Good options. Dishes don't come with rice so you have to pay extra for rice which is kinda blah.  Verdict? Meh."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch ate the kare kare which beef short rib with eggplant and some other vegetables all braised  together in a rich creamy peanut sauce until the beef was fall off the bone tender this was the best dish we ordered and I did enjoy it when you think peanut sauce usually what comes to mind is that sweet sauce you get at Thai restaurants please note this was very different not sweet and a lot more subtle we also ordered beef and shrimp with mixed vegetables which was ok although the there was plenty of good vegetables the sauce was pretty mundane and the beef was a little tough we also ordered the garlic rice which was a good rice dish tastes pretty much as the name states (rice with garlic) they also give you shrimp past on the side which pairs well with their food it is fermented so it has quite a salty taste which I enjoyed the service I would say was just below passable our waiter was not rude but not polite either nor was he smiling or welcoming I don't think it was intentional more of a lack of training"}
{"text":"Decent food. Filipino food cannot be made fast so I suggest calling in before arriving or you'll be waiting a while. I hate the typical hot buffet Filipino food places. This is a sit down fresh-ish type of place. I think they do karaoke at nights but I've never experienced it.   Ambiance is islandy if you're into that.   Bathrooms are like portapoties."}
{"text":"been here a couple of times and really wasn't too impressed.   The food is mediocre, i mean there is definitely better Filipino restaurants out there. The good this is every Saturday they have a live band, there is a $5 cover fee and it is mandatory for your to spend $15.00 worth of food or drinks. that was the biggest turn off, I mean its a given that I would be spending money of food and drinks, but to tell me I have to spend $15.00 worth after already agreeing to pay cover for a live band that is also pretty mediocre,, no thanks! I've been twice with family and we seem to always end up here because its not busy, we can sit and although not so good there is entertainment, but I think the whole cover and mandatory spending on food needs to be rethought when they explain it, because it was not appreciated that's for sure.  i would have to be forced to come back here, just saying."}
