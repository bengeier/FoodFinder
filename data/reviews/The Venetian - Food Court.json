{"text":"The italian one was extremely expensive and the food had no taste. I've prdered the so called 'soup of the day' and got a 4 ounces soup with no taste at all. I've paid $10. The I've ordered the veggie filled peperoni, teh veggies were not cooked enough, and it tasted horrible. My hubby got the seafood salad,, he brought it back, so disgusting it was. Don't eat at the italian restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"The Greek place Pan was terrible. The turkey club had very little dry turkey and the fries were very cold. The pita wrap ha almost no meat. The $3.00 soda was very small and mostly ice yet they still charge $1.08 for a refill."}
{"text":"I went to the new pizza place in the food court. i had just landed from SF 5 hours late and was starved.   Normally I stay at Wynn / Encore bjut on this trip, I decided to change it up with my Miami friends who arrive tomorrow.   The 1Hotel is enormous, bone early unmanageable and hard to navigate but at least I was able to get a decent snack from people who cares about their work.  they were helpful, he .ca the 4 stars."}
{"text":"I love this foodcourt at the Venetian!!!  I was able to order the perfect meal in all the right times while in Vegas.  My favorites were the Chicken Kale Salad @ $12.98.  I ordered extra chicken at only $3!!!  Eating clean is a daily challenge, especially when you are traveling.   This place saved me by helping to get my daily need of proteins without the cost of room service."}
{"text":"Gelato: Very rude! They treated my wife horribly today. We won't ever eat there again. Should have a manager on site who cares about customers. Very disappointed. They were more interested in talking with each other than helping paying customers."}
{"text":"Great place to eat if your on a budget & don't want to spend your money. They have subway, pizza, chicken, salads, Panda Express, Johnny rockets, ice cream & etc.   Great place to just sit too."}
{"text":"Lots of nice food choices because they have a wide variety of vendors to cater to everyone's needs. There is a lot of seating space. Very clean."}
{"text":"If you love your money. Then don't waste it at \"philly cheese steak\". Place.  Spent over $30 bucks on two Phil's steak plates. Only little bit meat and dry as hell. All the phillys ive ate had provolone cheese. But here. It says \"voice of cheese\" but all they have is American . WTH. Waste of money"}
{"text":"The Venetian is the biggest disappointment in Las Vegas! The food court has very little to choose from and way over priced. The service is simple terrible as well!"}
{"text":"Good selection, nice ambiance, strategically located. Pretty much every corner of the hotel is stunning -- great place to visit."}
{"text":"We're always looking for quality food for less while in Vegas. While meandering through the Venetian Canal Shoppes, we came across the food court we'd stopped at last time we were here. It boasts a variety of quick eateries: Chipotle, Subway, Panda, Johnny Rockets, Prime Burger, Kabob Empire (highly recommended) etc. A nice place to grab a meal without emptying out the bank."}
{"text":"As soon as you enter from the parking lot, there is this nice little food court. (Check the Venetian Map for more accurate directions depending on where you have parked)  The first thing I thought of when I walked in was \"Dang! this looks like the food court at Brea Mall\". They have made to order or fast food, American or Ethnic, whatever you desire.   Pros: Lots of options to choose from -Mexican -Italian -Indian -Traditional American burgers -Mediterranean -Japanese -Chinese -Subway, and -Desserts 4 stars for having a Desi place (Curry Pot) at a food court! Unfortunately, the line was 30 Minute long, so we did not dine there. Finding seating could be a problem, however there is abundant seating to relax your legs before you walk another couple of Hours at this massive casino.   Cons: No TV's, or good music in the background."}
{"text":"Great food court with anything from subway, chipotle to sushi and Indian food. Typical mall prices"}
{"text":"Located in the Venetian by the casino. Not a lot of options and the places are okay.  I believe there is a gelato/coffee place, Italian. Mexican and pizza place.  The seating area is quite big, so not hard to find a seat."}
{"text":"The Venetian is \"The Venetian\", the casino level Food Court has such great choices! My favs are: Gelato, their European breakfast and their bacon is on spot, Krispy Kreme donuts, their Italian coffee Illly is soooo good, their Sticky Buns at the bakery, On the Upper level Food Court, their Pizza is delicious with garlic knots and salad is so good. The ambiance and the way they designed the tables is very pleasant, peaceful and makes it a great eating experience! You dont even realize the casino is just a few feet away...you are totally transported. Im a local and I love to go for the food of course, but also for the experience....A High recommendation!"}
{"text":"**Yelp 100 Challenge 2017 52/100**  Gets the job done. If you're coming here, let's assume you're staying in the Venetian or Palazzo trying to get something in your tummy to keep the party going - and for that, it'll do. It has chain options like chipotle and johnny rockets; there's a pizza place that's not too bad and a few other options as well. Everything's a little up-priced, but none not on par for Vegas.   Stick to simple dishes and you'll be recharged and ready to go again soon enough. If you want an amazing, mind-blowing meal, go elsewhere, but for something on the go, it'll get the job done."}
{"text":"Nothing great. A mall like enviorment with some added variety. Expensive options. But easy and fast"}
{"text":"If all roads lead to Rome than surely all toilets lead to Venice. And what better place to test that theory than the public restrooms at the Venetian Hotel and Casino.  Come for the slots, stay for the explosive diarrhea."}
{"text":"I love everything about the Venetian! The atmosphere, the music, the ambience...everything reminds me of Venice, without pigeons.   How could they create a plaza identical to St. Mark Square? Well they did! And there's always a show with real characters in masks to remind you that Italy is living inside these walls in the heart of Las Vegas.  But the restaurants are the touch√©. Authentic Italian restaurants with personnel from Italy like myself ready to welcome you with big smiles. We had lunch here and we didn't regret it.   Perhaps a little overpriced, but worth it. After all, you're getting the food + the show, and you're not coming here every day.   I can't wait to be back and live again this amazing experience. There are plenty of shops along the canals too!"}
{"text":"I went to eat at the Food Court at the Venetian Hotel and Casino.  The one in the basement floor.    I tried the Cafe Pan and had their Roasted Lamb with Rice and Salad.  It was about $10 and a bargain for this exclusive hotel.   The salad had very fresh lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes and croutons with enough dressing.  With the dressing the salad was not too soggy.      They gave half a Take out container for the salad and filled the other half with rice and plenty of lamb with hummus on the side.   I couldn't finish it in one sitting, but I don't eat much.  So I took it on the plane with me for my late dinner.  Cafe Pan had sandwiches, pastries, espresso as well.       There was a Pasta Take out counter on the upper floor Food Court that I wanted to try but I ran out of time.   But on my next trip to Vegas, I hope to try it if it's still there.   The prices were very reasonable, under $13.  If you are on a budget and don't want to pay for additional Tip money, the Food Courts at the Venetian is one of the best to offer.  They have a variety of Take out counters from Asian food, Italian, American burgers, and Pizza.    It's great if you have small kids who are picky and you don't really want to spend very much on them if they can't finish their meal and food is left to waste."}
