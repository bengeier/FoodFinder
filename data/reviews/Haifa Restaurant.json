{"text":"Came to eat here with business partners after CES and it was amazing food and a great experience . Chicken sheeshlik was amazing. Highly recommended and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"staff was very friendly. the absolute best french fries ever made. falafel balls were amazing as well. rated 3 because our steaks were not made the way we wanted them. otherwise great restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible service and WAY Too expensive. Not worth it!!! We left hungry after the meal."}
{"text":"Kosher? Good option. 

Service was slow, but our group enjoyed a peaceful and tasty sit-down meal. everything was delicious. 

For more fast-food kinda food, Schwarma/ Salad/ Israeli, visit Jerusalem Grill 15 minutes away."}
{"text":"Just had a lovely dinner there with my family. The service was fast and the waiter attentive. We were asked several times by the waiter and the manager about our meal. We ate at Jerusalem Grill last night and the meal here was far superior."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great food and service!  Best schnitzel I've ever had.  Sent us home with some extra warm pitas."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Every time were in Vegas we visit this place. It's clean, fresh food, prices are ok and they have great steaks!"}
{"text":"We ate dinner at Haifa Restaurant on April 18th. This was most probably the worst dining experience that I have ever had. We were a group of 7. From the moment that we were seated, we were ignored. We asked for water three times, and eventually had to stand up and walk over to the server to insist on water. We then asked for lemons for the water, and again had to wait 30 minutes and 3 requests to get them. When the meals were bought to the table, the one vegetarian at the table did not get her meal. Her meal finally arrived after everyone else was done with their meals. We asked for ketchup, and again had to walk across the restaurant to demand it of the server after 30 minutes. The server gave us a lot of attitude telling us that things were slow because all the food is fresh and made to order. Lemons and Ketchup are fresh and made to order?

The food itself was mediocre and expensive. If you want a far superior kosher restaurant in Las Vegas, try Kosher On The Go.

Yuck!"}
{"text":"Eat at Haifa many years ago and was really good, but now on this return trip they moved to some shady shopping center,owners are no longer Israelis not even Jews, I am not prejudice but they are clueless about Kosher/Israeli food, it was very substandard, small portions and very high tourist prices! Plenty of other real Israeli kosher restaurants in Vegas to go too!"}
{"text":"The food was not good and very expensive.
The French fries were fried in old oil, the shawarma was very average."}
{"text":"I found this spot on Yelp, checked out the website, and was suitably impressed enough to call in an order for pickup. The woman I spoke to was polite, and even called back to tell me they were out of an item so I could reorder.

Location leaves a lot to be desired. It's in the same general area as Lotus of Siam, Komol, and Arawan- but toward the back of the shopping center, in the same building as Vegas Lounge, but on the other side. Even armed with the address, I had to call for help finding them. Inside is much nicer, with mirrored walls and linen table cloths, like an event space. 

No customers or staff present when I entered. I approached the bar and part of my order was waiting. That's when I saw the receipt: $14 for my schnitzel pita wrap and $24 for a grilled chicken salad. Wait, what?! I had tried to order the Nicoise salad ($14) but they were out of tuna, how does substituting chicken (due to no fault of my own) jack up the price $10?!

I told the employee to cancel the salad, $24 for a grilled chicken salad is ridiculous. She seemed surprised and confused. I left with my wrap and went on my way. The wrap was about half the size as similarly-priced orders I've had elsewhere, and the hummus was barely spread half way into the wrap. The amount of protein was generous, but it lacked flavor and the pita was falling apart. I love Mediterranean food but this was absolutely bland. 

TLDR: If you have to stick to a Kosher* diet, I guess it's good to have another option in town. If you're just popping in for a meal, the menu sounds promising but my experience left a lot to be desired. *Unclear if they are certified."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of the place was very nice. For a kosher restaurant, there was plenty of room and comfortable tables and chairs. The noise level and ambience was also nice. We were quickly seated and our orders were also taken quickly. The food also came VERY quickly.

I ordered a steak (what else to have in Vegas?). The quality of the meat was mediocre--not great, but not awful. I ordered it medium rare (pink), but it was cooked done/well done (brown). I was pretty disappointed. But despite it being way overcooked (for my personal preference) it was still tasty. They gave us a free dessert to compensate for the steak, which was unexpected and nice.

Overall, the food was good, but I would say not a good value for the price. In other words, for what we paid ($98 for two people), my expectations were much higher."}
{"text":"Just had one of the best falafel pita pockets I've ever tasted. Fresh and so tasty. Hubby had the pastrami sandwich and loved it too. We will definitely come back when in town. Thank you Haifa for amazing food and service."}
{"text":"Not understanding the vitriol of the other reviewer, because I thought this place was pretty darn good.  We did show up at an off hour, though, so maybe service is different when the place is crowded.

We ordered a salad plate with hummus, baba ganouj, and turkish eggplant salad, and all were delicious.  In fact, the baba ganouj was really smoky that suggested the eggplant being broiled over an open flame, which is something they don't always do in kosher restaurants.  I was pleasantly surprised.

Dinner was Shwarma with a side of shoestring fries dusted in seasoned salt and Israeli salad.  The shwarma wasn't cut from a big wheel the way it usually is, so I wouldn't even call it authentic shwarma, but was spiced with a really interesting combination of spices and grilled.  Not sure what was in it, but it was definitely more turmeric than paprika.  It was delicious, and but for the few little bits of turkey gristle we got with it, I would call it perfect.

Drinks include Spring (Israeli juice drink) and several varities of soda.  Service is friendly and prompt.  Portions are huge (one appetizer platter and one entree were more than enough for our family of four)."}
{"text":"Was not impressed by this place. The food was okay, service was good. The place to me looked a little run down. Only went there once, because it didn't earn a return trip."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The guy was very mean. I'm glad I am just a tourist. But don't go here. There are other great kosher places around town. Jerusalem grill has a friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Food was whatever and Service was horrible.  I had to ask for water, bread, etc.  When I received my entree, the steak Kababs I could not even eat them all as several were just fat skewers.  The meat was hard and very chewy and when I showed the manager he was like ok.    He did not even replace it or discount it at all.  He made it seem like I cooked it and served it to myself.  

I will not go back because it was not worth the money at all."}
{"text":"Very tasty and reasonable prices. Nice Moroccan influence on the menu, typical Israeli offerings, good size and quiet place. Off the beaten path in Vegas, about 15-20 minutes away from the heart of the Strip."}
{"text":"So I call up because my regular kosher hot spot is closed for catering orders for shabis and Purim. I ordered the schnitzel/falafel which was good, the babagnoosh very good. The pita was store bought not like my regular place where it's fresh and homemade. I try and take s bite out of my Corned Beef sandwich WOW-TOUGH AS SHOE LEATHER! I ask for corned beef on Rye and get shoe leather on Wheat! For kosher there are other better places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Classy restaurant, love the comfy chairs. The food is very good and comes out in good timing. The servers are very nice and attentive. The pita is hot, fresh and runs out quick, because it's very tasty."}
{"text":"Service was kindof slow but the food was delicious. Great portions and the restaurant has a very comfortable feel."}
{"text":"Overall this restaurant is not great, especially for the pricing. 

Beware of hidden charges. We asked for extra pita with the hummus and there was an extra charge for it that was unexpected. In addition, 15% tip is charged regardless of the size of the party, which is odd.

We ordered the Haifa combination plate that came with kabob, chicken and beef shishlik, shwarma, and two sides for $36 to share. This was a much smaller portion than expected for the price especially because the french fries (one of the sides) took up most of the plate. 

In addition, the meat was not great. The beef and chicken shishlik was tough and the chicken was tasteless and too salty. The shwarma was tasty but a little too salty. 

Looking at the rest of the menu, the pricing seems to be a bit aggressive. For example, a falafel pita costs $12, much higher than I've seen it priced anywhere else. 

For a restaurant this expensive, I expected the restaurant to look more maintained and less aged. In addition, I'd have expected the owner to have his own office in the back, rather than assigning one of the restaurant's tables as one and watching CNN at a volume audible throughout the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here lunch and dinner on two different days. 

Quality of service depends on what day/time you're there as there is usually only 1 server working.  The restaurant automatically adds a 15% tip onto each bill, so be careful about over tipping. 

Food was generally good, e Yemenite soup was amazing and I'd go back there again just for this dish. Other entrees and apps are standard. 

The restaurant is a little off the strip, so if you go by cab, you should order one well in advance of when you need one on your return back to your hotel. If you're traveling by car, then it's pretty simple to get to. 

This isn't my favorite Kosher restaurant in Vegas, but it is the closest to the strip and the food doesn't suck. So I'll be going back again and again."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The decor is too much, and yet not enough. It looks like it wants to be a fancy restaurant, but the ceiling is exposed. Relatively expensive, but i guess most kosher places are. Still, $12 for schawarma pita without any sides or drink is too much. It tasted fine. Not great, not bad, just fine. The pita was store bought, and the hummus tasted like it was also store bought. The wait staff were fine. They never refilled my water or asked if i wanted anything else, but they were friendly. I would've given 3 stars for being average, but when the check came, 18% gratuity was included. I was there by myself, so they automatically put gratuity for a party of 1. Then on the credit card slip they have a place for additional gratuity. So lost a star for that. If you keep strict kosher, the food tasted fine enough that I'd say you're fine to come here. But i won't be back."}
{"text":"Great customer service
They made my grand father birthday the best
Great food and great customer service"}
