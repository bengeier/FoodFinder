{"text":"The best Peameal Bacon Sammie ever!  Put some spicy mustard on that baby and it'll rock your world!!!"}
{"text":"Carousel is known for its peameal bacon sandwiches, and I love bacon as much as the next geek. But (!!!) that's not what I come here for. Here they do two things better and cheaper than anywhere else in Toronto:

Firstly, the vegetarian foccacia sandwich is something to behold: Provolone, roasted zucchini and red pepper, and breaded eggplant are piled high on a gorgeousn quarter-round of foccacia. At $5.75 all-in, it's a cheap lunch and so big that usually it lasts me two meals. Then only thing that's touch and go is the bread, which sometimes is a bit soggy for having had oily tomatoes sitting on top.

Second, the portugese corn bread. A huge loaf sets you back only about $2.25, making it a cheap alternative to Italian or French style white loaves. It's a bit denser than white bread, but has a slightly sweet taste and makes for great sandwiches, toast, and croutons."}
{"text":"Bah.  Piles of peameal on a bun--no condiments, no vegetables, nothing.  What a profound disappointment.  It was so salty that it was overwhelming; after the first three bites I couldn't taste anything anymore.  I guess it gets props for being exactly as described, but there are way better things to spend your money on at the market."}
{"text":"I love certain things about Canada: universal healthcare, Sidney Crosby, poutine, and Caesars. Is it awful if I admit that peameal bacon is not on the list? 

This was my first taste of the unsmoked back bacon, and while I liked the soft Carousel bun it came on, if I were going to have a bacon sandwich, I'd rather have a BLT with crispy, smoked streaky bacon made from pork belly. 

I'm sorry! Please don't exile me back to the States.

Peameal bacon sandwich = $5.30 + double-digit Canadian taxes"}
{"text":"Traditional peameal bacon sandwich @ $7.00, slightly pricey but was good. Originating from Toronto, it's also refer to cornmeal bacon. I could not give this signature dish of Toronto a miss, so u gotta visit the famous St Lawrence Market although the guy was took my order has been slight aloof. 

The peameal bacon is in fact a piece of boneless lean loin, coated in ground yellow cornmeal, not the historical yellow peas. 

It is grilled to perfect, with bits of charred at some edges while leaving the interior tender and slightly pink. The cornmeal does the trick by giving it some crisp when grilled.

Generally, u may add either mayonnaise, tomato to it while I have it sterile in order to taste it unadulterated. The meat has an obvious brine flavor as u bite but the soft fluffy plain country bun paired up brilliantly, the total mouthfeel is satisfying. 

So head to St Lawrence market and visit the world's best food market and grab a $6.20 plus tax peameal bacon sandwich. Alternatively, the store also offer other breakfast specials: breakfast on a bun $5.75, double egg $4.35, big hog $7.75, traditional full size peameal style bacon on bun $6.75. Couldn't make it by 11am? Fret not! Sandwiches like BBQ chicken, Hot sausage, pita, wraps and even greek salads are available. If pork peameal bacon is not your option, try veal parmigiana or zesty chicken variation with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, grilled peppers & onions on soft country bun @$6.85! For plain & easy take out, they have a range of bakeries available as well, all on the right hand side to choose from!"}
{"text":"Located inside the St. Lawrence Market, Carousel is very popular and kind of a zoo.  We went there to try their famous peameal bacon sandwich.  I was pretty surprised that they also had a huge assortment of baked goods.  So we also tried the Portuguese style egg custard and a Montreal style bagel.  I appreciate the amount of variety they are offering, but I didn't find the peameal bacon very flavorful.  It was baked and pretty bland."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is with the Peameal Sandwich. I get it, its the famous Canadian sandwich, but I think its personal taste preferences. For the history of it, I think its worthy of a visit to this bakery to try the sandwich. Personally, I prefer flavors that are more complex than a salty bacon/pork chop type meat sandwiched in a bun. To each his own!"}
{"text":"I had a sandwich and it was delicious. I enjoy all the experience of going to the market and then eating outside. The service is also very good and the price is convenient."}
{"text":"A simple delicious sandwich.

Perfectly balanced, salty peameal bacon on a fresh bun.
What is there not to love about this?

A must stop of us when we visit the St Lawrence Market.

Our sandwich was made to order.
The bacon was still warm and the bread perfectly complimented the bacon.
We passed on the condiment and finished this on our way to the next food stand."}
{"text":"We arrived on a weekday morning so there was no line or wait. The pea-meal sandwich was good and you could choose your our condiments. It's clearly a tourist attraction and they run a tight ship. Most farmer's markets have signature dishes anf this is one of them."}
{"text":"Awesome! We had two pea meal bacon sandwiches and a breakfast sandwich and they were the best we've ever had. What more can I say. Good prices, great food friendly staff. You can't go wrong eating here!"}
{"text":"I usually visit the St. Lawrence market on Saturday's to pick up produce, and end up wandering around looking for tasty/interesting things to make over the weekend.

This particular weekend I was quite hung over and abandoned by quest to decided to indulge in Carousel's breakfast sandwich. For just over $5 you get quite a lot of food .. lots of friend egg, processed cheese and of course loads of peameal bacon. This was absolutely delicious and totally hit the spot. The line was incredibly quick moving and the moment this thing hit my stomach I felt better.

I'll definitely be back here this Saturday - a great snack while wandering the market, or for me, now a destination in itself!"}
{"text":"Ordered veal and chicken parmigiana sandwiches - both spicy, for under $16.  Service was quick, we came just before noon on a Thursday and there was no line up.  

Sandwiches were fairly large, enjoyed the chicken better than the veal.  They were a bit stingy on the vegetables, and sauce.  The peppers have a good kick!"}
{"text":"Like most other people here, I went for the peameal bacon sandwich. I went at around 5 pm and the man at the counter told me that the kitchen closed at 3 pm so he wouldn't be able to add an egg or lettuce to my sandwich.
So I opted for the plain sandwich and I added my own toppings (they have a counter with banana peppers and an array of condiments - mustard, horseradish, ketchup, hot sauce, mayo, etc.).
The meat is definitely the highlight of the sandwich, along with the perfect bun. I can see how it would be too salty and plain without the condiments, so go all out on them and each bite will be a surprise! The bacon was chewy and cooked to just the right texture. And even though the sandwich was expensive ($7), they don't skimp on the bacon - it's one of those sandwiches where you get some meat in every bite."}
{"text":"Very simple, yet very good. Maybe it's because I haven't ever had bacon like this before in the south but this sandwich was pretty damn good. The breakfast version and their regular peameal bacon sandwich hit the spot. The bread was nice and soft and they provide a generous! amount of meat. We didn't try other peameal bacon sandwich's from the other vendors at St. Lawrence Market but this location had Emeril vouching for them so we went with it. Before we left our trip, we were going to stop by for second's but to our dismay the market was closed on Monday. Service was great. We were running low on Canadian cash, and like many places they took the US dollar as well. Definately a must try!"}
{"text":"\"When in Rome...this is a famous sandwich so why not try it out.  The \"bacon\" is Canadian bacon but it was very tasty.  It is not dry like the other Canadian bacon I had in the past.  The bread was fresh and soft.  It is also not very salty which is great.  This is THE sandwich so they make a load of it and kept it on the side but it was still warm and the bread was not soggy at all.  I got my sandwich right away while my friend had to wait for her chicken parm which she said was good."}
{"text":"Plain and simple, yet unique to Toronto sandwich that I found via Bourdain's recommendation."}

*No specific seating area
*Specialize in Peameal Bacon on a Bun
*Inside St Lawrence Market

Famous for their Peameal Bacon on a Soft Country Bun, Carousel Bakery is located inside the popular tourist attraction, St Lawrence Market. I passed by this place couple times knowing it's very popular, so one day I decided to give it a try. The sandwich was $5.75 plus tax and they have me packets of mustard, mayo, honey mustard and ketchup. 

There is nothing BUT peameal bacon inside the bun, and because I was given all these packets of sauce....I decided to put all of them in except the honey mustard. I thought sandwich was kind of on the expensive side...considering you can get 6 foot sandwich at Subway for $5 but I guess the sandwich is pretty big.

There are SO MUCH peameal bacon inside. I guess I am getting my moneys worth.....but it was so salty! The bun was soft and the peameal bacon was good but I didn't see anything special about it. I felt like I was eating a sandwich with thick pieces of salty ham. I kept on trying to taste or feel what the hype was about...but I couldn't.

Summary: This was a big disappointment. It was just salty and nothing special. If I wanted a sandwich, I'd much rather visit Subway for a Subway Club.

*chomp chomp*"}
{"text":"Not something I would buy again. Their famous peameal bacon sandwich tasted exactly like a dry ham sandwich."}
{"text":"Nothing really epic to report here. Food sounded amazing .. was average. I mean it was good but nothing special. Would have been lovely only for the easy-single cheese slice for an excuse for cheese.. there was a big hustle and bustle and the food was ready in no time as there was plenty of people ordering the same few orders.."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever! A Toronto delicacy, peameal bacon on a fresh kaiser bun. I like to have mine with cheese and egg. St. Lawrence Market is also a fun place to people-watch while you eat, or take your sandwich and enjoy it outside in the courtyard on a nice day. Great pairing with a matinee at the Rainbow Cinema across the street."}
{"text":"Tried the famous Peameal Bacon sandwich. It was okay. The highlight was the freshly baked bun. I would have tried other items on the menu but the sandwich filled me up."}
{"text":"You gotta go Big Hog or go home! The peameal, fried egg, cheese & bread come together where you feel your arteries hardening. Plus they have a selection of mustards you can add depending on your spice pain level. Good times & good eats!"}
{"text":"Cash only - the peameal sandwich is a bit salty for my liking but it was worth a try. Was pretty stuffed given the size of the sandwich. Also tried their Portuguese egg tart which was alright - wish it was warmed up."}
{"text":"So apparently Carousel Bakery is famous for its peameal bacon sandwich.  Even Emeril loves it (or so a sign says).  I wasn't in the mood for bacon, but I'm always in the mood for eggplant and zucchini.  Throw in some chicken and stuff it all into a large bun and I'm a very happy camper.  This oversized sandwich cost me $5.50 and my hunger was satisfied for hours (approximately 6 or 7).

I would have appreciated the sandwich more if heat was added or if it was prepared fresh upon ordering.  This one happened to be already made, wrapped up, just sitting there asking me to buy it.  It was still incredibly fresh so it was probably made only moments earlier.

There are also hot sandwich options like the obvious peameal bacon or veal.  There were lots of people behind the counter helping customers so we didn't have to wait long for our food, even during peak lunch hours."}
{"text":"Why 3 stars? Because I didn't understand the Peameal Bacon.

   ---   ---   ---

I was very excited to try something I'd never had before, but ended up pretty underwhelmed. It basically just tasted like a dry pork chop sandwich. Maybe it's a nature vs. nurture situation - had I grown up eating Pemeal Bacon sandwiches with my Grandpap, things maybe would have been different for me. But without any sentimental attachment, and a purely objective viewpoint, the Peameal Bacon sandwich is what 3-stars were made for."}
{"text":"There can be nothing bad about this sandwich, except for the fact that it doesn't have enough of that juicy peameal bacon.

Don't be intimidated if there is a line, it moves really quickly and you can order from any of the many people manning the rather long counter.

Just go with the breakfast on a bun.  Fried egg, a few slices of fried, briny peameal bacon and a slice of american cheddar.  OH SO GOOD!!!!  I also love that they give you a wide selection of complimentary condiments to go with your sandwich - siracha chili sauce, mayonaise, 3 types of mustard etc.

Simply wonderful.  Walk around St Lawrence Market before and after this!"}
{"text":"It's bacon on a bun.  Really, that's all it is.  And for $6.75 a pop, this is not cheap bacon either.  Obviously, I had to try it so I could say that I did, but once I ate it, I can't say that I was overly impressed.  Mustard helped the flavor but it's still just pieces of Canadian bacon on bread in the end.  It's worth trying once but unless you're really into this sort of thing, you probably won't go back and get it again."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of pemeal bacon as I've usually eaten grocery store bought brand that's chewy, fatty and full of gristle. The bacon here is lean yet so flavorful, moist and succulent."}
{"text":"On my day off I decided to drop by St. Lawrence Market.  It was early and most stalls were just getting ready for the day. A sign selling peameal  bacon sandwich for $6.45 caught my eye. I asked what was in it and the friendly staff said 6 thick slices of bacon between a bun. There are condiments on the side counter you can add to your liking she points out.  I opted for their breakfast sandwich which has 2 slices of bacon, fried egg & cheddar cheese. If you like McD's egg mcmuffin, this is 100 times better. The thick slices of peameal is tender, juicy & seasoned well. Along with the egg, cheddar & soft country bun it was not bad. Now if they served it with a hollandaise, that would put this over the top."}
{"text":"Wandered to the market to get something yummy to eat before we trekked outta the city into cottage country. I got the breakfast sandwich - fried egg, cheese, peameal bacon on a soft bun - and asked them to add a tomato. I'm a bit of a stickler for not walking and eating so I waited till the car to induldge... a good 30 minutes later. This sandwich was incredible! Even though I waited 30 minutes to eat it, it wasn't soggy, ti was still warm and I bet you it would be just as amazing cold. I can imagine it being terrific after a crazy hangover with a beautiful cup of coffee .... eat it. Please do yourself a favour!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in Toronto and I had to try the Peameal Bacon Sandwich at Carousel Bakery located inside St. Lawrence Market. There was a small line, but it moved quickly. The salty tender bacon on a soft bun did not disappoint! Don't forget the mustard."}
{"text":"Tried the peameal bacon sandwich (they ran out of soft bun, so they used ciabatta instead), and I'm really on the fence about this. It's a bit salty, but flavorful. It's as described - slices of peameal bacon in a bun. Nothing else on it. I know this is supposed to be a staple, but probably just not for me!"}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday towards the end of the lunch rush, and there was essentially no line up. I ordered the famous peameal bacon sandwich to see what all the hype was about. The stall was well staffed and it literally took less than a minute from placing my order to getting my sandwich.

For $6.45 (~$7.25 after tax), I was a little surprised to see how small the sandwich was. After finding a seat within the marketplace and inspecting the sandwich some more, the sandwich is essentially five pieces of peameal bacon in a bun; no condiments, no toppings. I'm not sure why I expected anything more - the sign even said \"Peameal Bacon on a soft country bun\"! Yet I couldn't help but feel like I was eating a warm, albeit juicer, ham sandwich.

With that said, the bread was soft and seemed fresh. The peameal bacon was tender, moist and warm, although it was slightly salty and progressively saltier  further into the sandwich. I was impressed that the sandwich was still warm given  that it was likely prepared in batches and wrapped in advance of the lunch rush. 

Overall, while slightly overpriced, a good simple sandwich."}
{"text":"It was my first time here.  This bakery is located into St. Lawrence market.  It is a very busy breakfast hotspot.  I saw that their peameal bacon burger is very famous, but I chose to have the peameal bacon with a regular burger.  The service was fast as they have a already pre-packaged the burger and was piping hot.  It was really tasty and fresh.  The price was quite reasonable.  I would come back again if i decide to enjoy a good burger in the future."}
{"text":"Their custard tarts and Breakfast on a Bun (Peameal Bacon, Egg, and Cheese sandwich) make a trip to Toronto worth while for any food lover.  If i lived in this town, I would surely go to this place at least once a week.  My wife and I just got back form our trip and are already planning the next one.  Toronto has plenty of other amazing attractions, but Carousel Bakery is always at or near the top of the list.  If you like breakfast sandwiches, you need to go to here now."}
{"text":"Used to frequent this place for their peameal bacon sandwich all the time when working nearby so had to come back and relive the nostalgia.  The peameal sandwich was still as juicy and meaty as I remember.  I recall it being on a kaiser bun before and I prefer that over the country bun it comes with now.  

I was in the neighborhood a few months back and tried to order a sandwich for lunch but didn't realize the market closes on Monday so settled for a peameal sandwich from Paddington's (the only thing open).  It did not compare, the bacon wasn't at moist.

Don't be disappointed, go to Carousel for the peameal and no where else!"}
{"text":"I fucking love the St. Lawrence Market, like fucking love it.  If I could marry the St. Lawrence Market, I would.  

Carousel Bakery hands down has the best peameal on a bun you can get.  They don't use the meat from a sad sick piggy.  They use the meat of a happy, well fed, clam and coolio piggy.  You can taste the difference.  Go down the hall a bit north to the \"other\" peameal bacon shop and do a taste test.  I dare you.

The meat doesn't even need ketchup. And from a ketchup fan (yes, sad but true) this is a huge compliment.  This is the way meat was meant to be - tender and flavourful.

The super soft bun the meat is served on is so good.  You just want to stand up and hug someone and offer them a bite of your sandwich.  

Go to the St. Lawrence Market early next Sat (say 7 or 8 am) and try this puppy out, if you haven't done so already.  Better yet, give me a shout, and I will join you."}
{"text":"Our trip to St. Lawrence market on a Saturday morning starts with a Breakfast On A Bun from Carousel bakeries.
Over the past 20 years it has not changed.  
Slightly runny egg, melted cheddar cheese, and hot peameal bacon all in a fresh, crusty, but slightly chewy bun.

There are many versions of this around the market, but Carousel is the original."}
{"text":"I love pastelas natas (tiny amazing Portuguese custard pastries). I've only tried two nata sellers in the St. Lawrence Market, but there was a marked (ahem) difference between them. And Carousel Bakery was the winner. 

They sell a really good eggplant Parmesan sandwich, too, great workday lunch for $6.99."}
{"text":"I've been getting the peameal sandwich from there for a couple of decades now! Only a few times where I didn't have the best cut of meat. I say it's still worth every penny! YUM!"}
{"text":"I have to admit, I am caught up on the hype. I don't know what it is about the peameal sandwich, but to me it is out of this world. I can't say anything else that other reviewer haven't. Try it and place your vote."}
{"text":"butter croissant.
my second favourite in the city.
(first is Brassai's)"}
{"text":"My father and I have a yearly tradition of walking from his apartment to St. Lawrence Market early in the am and grabbing a peameal bacon sandwich from here. Maybe we should branch out but I love our tradition. 
The bread is soft, the bacon seasoned just enough to make it tasty but not overly salty. The portion is generous. My fried egg is always cooked to perfection. 
I love this place!"}
{"text":"I heard that Carousel Bakery is all the rave at St Lawrence Market. However, while the peameal bacon sandwich is palatable, it is literally just Canadian bacon in a soft bun and the bacon itself is quite salty."}
{"text":"Being the tourist that I am, I took a ton of pics. Enjoy!

Okay, I don't see what the big deal is about their pea bacon sandwich (that's what I call it). It's like five slices of salty meat in a dry bun. The meat is like a smoked ham or like Canadian bacon I guess. It was $6.20. I didn't know until I read a few reviews just now that you can get stuff added to it. Ours was just plain. I would probably not get it again. There are so many other things to try at the market!

If you add $1.25 to any sandwich you get their soup of the day. Today's was broccoli potato. It was brothy and not creamy like we expected. It was very meh and healthy tasting. Not delicious like the sign claimed! I should really stop believing these signs. 

I might come again for a different sandwich, but definitely not the pea bacon or soup again. Most likely would try something at another stall though!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I came from New York and wasted my time coming here. It tastes like a ham sandwich, not to mention they didn't have any country buns and only 3 slices of of meat, really?!!! Nothing special as the pervious reviewer said and I would definitely not recommend this place or come here ever again. Complete waste of time, just go get a ham sandwich LoL"}
{"text":"Being the snob that I am, I bought the Wallpaper Toronto City Guide to see what hip-and-edgy attractions I should visit while I was there. In the \"24 Hours\" section, they recommended that a tourist should start their day at Saint Lawrence Market for a peameal bacon sandwich from Carousel Bakery. First of all, I was like \"what the hell is peameal bacon?\" and then I Googled it... So yes, I see why they recommend it. 

Saint Lawrence Market is a great place to start the day and allows you to enjoy local Toronto cheeses, coffee, meat and baked goods. The Carousel Bakery just makes it better. We had the \"breakfast on a bun\" sandwich, which was egg, cheese, and peameal bacon on a Kaiser roll (at least that's what we called them in NYC), and it was delicious. It was only after purchasing the sandwich, that I noticed all the other amazing baked goods they have including sweets, breads, etc. Now I must go back! Carousel Bakery is a great place for a quick, inexpensive and unique breakfast (or lunch)."}
{"text":"The reason I wanted to go to St Law market was because I had a want to have a back bacon on a bun.  While they have a variety of other things on their menu including all kinds of bread because the place is a bakery... all I seemed to want to have and care about was that bacon sandwich.

I mean they promote the thing and toot that horn too so it's not like they don't mind living off the fact that it's their featured item that they sell.  

How famous these sandwiches are and how well known they are is really how well you care to know about them.  What I'm saying is that if you were to ask me what food is \"Toronto\" I guess I would say this place.  Really we don't have a \"Toronto\" food to put into perspective when compared to other cities and such.  We don't have smoke meat, bagels or pizza \"Toronto\" style like Montreal does so if this qualifies us for having a famous Toronto food then so be it.

The sandwich is good and it's simple.  Nothing on it except bacon, peameal bacon to be exact.  The bread is light and fresh as you'd expect from a bakery and the bacon is piled decently high.  At one point I counted 6 layers when I was half way through the sandwich.  

So they are generous with the sandwich as well... back in the day when these were less expensive (everything always is) it's nice to see the product itself doesn't get skimped on but rather the price just increase as you'd expect to happen to everything these days.

Still, at 6.45 it's a good deal for the type of sandwich you're getting.  The staff here are funny as well as friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Best pea meal bacon sandwich at the Saint Lawrence market, served  on a great, super fresh roll with piles of tasty salty pea meal bacon.  Fix it up with a range of mustards from sweet to omfg my nose is flaming!  Grab a drink, this sucker makes you thirsty.  Now stuff your face as you walk around the market looking for more things to stuff your face with.  One is enough for two to snack on."}
{"text":"Tried the \"World Famous\" Peameal Bacon Sandwich today.  Ringing in at almost $6.  It was a sandwich made with a bun and a generous serving of peameal bacon wedged in between.  That's where it stops.  Condiments can be found toward the side of Carousel with your standard mustard, bbq sauce, ketchup etc.  However, I opted not to add anything to mine.

The peameal was quite juicy and tender served on their \"country-style bun\" which I didn't think was anything other than a hamburger bun with a fancy name.  It had just the right amount of salt and not overly salty like store-bought versions.  

All in all, it was a good sandwich - though I don't know if it was \"world famous.\""}
{"text":"This is a must have when visiting St. Lawrence market... even if the price has gone up over the last year. The peameal bacon sandwich with egg and cheese is delicious and super filling for breakfast. Make sure to arrive before 11AM because they aren't sold afterwards!"}
{"text":"The big hog was good breakfast sandwich, wish the egg was a bit more runny and had some sort of sause but the peameal bacon was so good"}
{"text":"I've never had a peameal bacon sandwich here.  My husband brought me home an eggplant with sauteed vegetables sandwich, and that was it.  I was smitten.  It is simple, absolutely delicious, and filling.  You can add chicken if you want, but I usually take it off.  We live in the neighbourhood and have it once or twice a week."}
{"text":"All the other reviews sub 5 stars should be ignored.  This is the single biggest reason to come to St Lawrence Market.  Been 4 years since my last pea meal on a bun here and the first bite was as good or better than my last.  Pro tip.  If you like spice, hit it with hot sauce and horseradish.  I don't want to go to heaven if this sandwich is not there."}
{"text":"If you're looking to get some good ol' fashion peameal bacon sandwich, this is the place to go. It's got the history, the celebrity endorsements and great, friendly service.

The spicy mustard was good but the sandwich I got could've used a bit more. Now, I've tried peameal bacon before so in comparison, I thought this was decent. Didn't blow my mind but I was having a part of history so that made up for it. Plus, it's in this older indoor marketplace in Toronto.

If you go here, ask for extra sauce, you won't regret it.

{"text":"I had the \"famous\" Carrousel bakery peameal sandwich: pretty much the saltiest thing I ever ate in my life. It was way too overrated and overpriced. The different magazine cuts on the counter mention how inexpensive of a treat their sandwich is, however their prices have now been jacked-up to around 7$ for a simple baloney sandwich."}
{"text":"Had the chicken parmesan sandwich and asked for it spicy and extra saucy. It came out as neither spicy or saucy. The chicken was cooked well and it came with red peppers and onions. The bun was a standard bun that I didn't have the desire to finish. I had half the sandwich and ended up tossing some of my bun and polishing off the rest of the chicken. 

It wasn't a terrible sandwich, but I also wasn't wowed either."}
{"text":"Located in St. Lawrence Market this place specializes in peameal bacon sandwiches. For $5.50 you get a kaiser roll piled high with delicious peameal bacon. When I got my sandwich and saw that there was nothing on it but peameal I was skeptical to say the least. They do have condiments you can add but I decided to have it alone to see how it would hold up. I must say that the simplicity of this sandwich was beautiful and both ingredients were executed nicely. The bacon is cooked on a flat top which gives it a nice little crust on the outside but keeps it pretty juicy and moist. The peameal has a nice bite to it but still tears away easily. One key aspect was that the bacon had the right amount of saltiness (I feared that the saltiness would be overwhelming). The kaiser roll complimented the bacon very well, it was very fresh, soft with just the right amount of flakiness on the outside. 
I must say that this sandwich may have converted me to peameal bacon over regular bacon. It is much meatier and no where near as fatty as regular bacon. I truly enjoyed the sandwich plain but next time I may add some mustard which I feel would add a little zing to it. 
If you are visiting St. Lawrence market stop in at carousel and get a peameal bacon sandwich, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"The peameal bacon is a must try when you visit Toronto. There are so much to eat at the St. Lawrence market, so don't stuff yourself."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto, and I had to try the \"world-famous peameal bacon sandwich.\" How am I supposed to rate this sandwich? Do I compare it to all of the sandwiches that I've eaten in my life? If so, then this sandwich doesn't fit at the top of the list. Do I compare this sandwich to other bacon-equivalent sandwiches that I've tasted? Then this sandwich still doesn't belong at the top of the list. This sandwich should have just been named famous Canadian sandwich or famous Toronto sandwich (not so worthy of the loose title \"world-famous,\" in my opinion). I've had better."}
{"text":"So I tried the peameal bacon sandwich because it is apparently the best sandwich in the world and worshipped by Emeril, Guy Fieri, and a ton of other random celebrities. Overall impression was MEH. I don't understand the hype. The bacon is fat and juicy, but that's basically it.  Not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"My first four months in Toronto last year were in this area.  Frequently I found myself here for breakfast.  Great sandwiches, good service and very reasonable prices.
The downside is that I always end up shopping in the market even if I don't really need anything."}
{"text":"CONSISTENT MESSAGE READERS:  PEAMEAL BACON SANDWICH IS DRY, SALTY AND BORING.  A friend of mine was telling me recently about how bad his experience with the overhyped peameal bacon sandwich was at the Carousel Bakery.  Then I realized I had written a review about it awhile ago.  I just went to find my review and I see there are alot of reviews similar to mine.  Yup, avoid the hype and this sandwich when you go to St. Lawrence Market!  It's not any good!"}
{"text":"While perusing St. Lawrence Market like any Weekday tourist, one fact is undeniable.
Carousel Bakery had more patrons hanging near them like Flies than most others.  

CB provides a visual attraction as well as better-than-most self promotion....
\"World Famous\"designation, Emeril Lagasse letter-of-gratitude, and Colors that remind you of ol' school McDonalds.

While the price-point stays Tourist-reasonable for that Tourist MUST-TRY Canadian protein (Peameal Bacon), I was slightly surprised to see that the Breakfast on a Bun was prepped ahead of time as 10+ were packaged and waiting for the next purchasers.  In addition, I notice a Full Flat-top of Peameal sizzling away for their next round(?)

Breakfast on a Bun($5.30)

-  While ingredients are fresh(Peameal Bacon, Egg, Cheese, Country Bun).
     I found the composition of the whole to be less than spectacular.  
    This item doesn't provide the proper showcase of the ingredients to our Global Companions.

------------

First impact  -  Country Bun exterior envelopes all other ingredients.

Second impact  -  Melted Cheese slowly oozes out.

LAST impact  -  Tender texture of nicely cooked Peameal Bacon.

------------

Verdict  -  Juiciness, flavour, and initial impact of the Peameal Bacon is sadly HIDDEN."}
{"text":"Get the breakfast bun - eggs, bacon and cheese for about $6. Delicious! There's a lot of foot traffic in the market so don't expect to find seating, but there is a really nice bench area next to the shop. Definitely recommend trying if you're looking for a quick bite or something to go."}
{"text":"Peameal sandwich was decent, i was expecting much more then peameal thrown in between a bun. Especially because they have an emeril lagasse poster by the cash register raving about how good their peameal sandwich is."}
{"text":"The peameal bacon sandwich is ALL THAT!

Nice for people watching.  Nice selection of drinks, too."}
{"text":"When I first started to research \"must eats\" in Toronto, peameal bacon came up. Apparently a peameal bacon sandwich is the Toronto equivalent to say, a Philly Cheesesteak or a NYC slice of pizza. Everyone online was saying you \"must\" have one at Carousel Bakery in St. Lawrence Market. So, to CB we went!
 
We showed up around 10am on a Saturday and had no idea where to order, where the line was, etc. So apologies to anyone we may have accidentally and inadvertently skipped the line in front of! We ordered two peameal breakfast sandwiches with cheese and egg. They are consistently churning these bad boys out, so our wait time was basically 0.
 
We opted to eat outside - it was a bit chilly but it was also brutally hot inside the market. The sandwich was really good. The bread was very soft and had the perfect meat-bread ratio. We both thoroughly enjoyed our sandwiches. As I'm writing this review, I kind of wish I had one right now."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I really wanted them to convince me that Canadian bacon is better than the other (real) bacon, but alas they fell short. It was salty and the bread was actually unremarkable and only slightly less dry than the sahara desert. If the meat wasn't so salty, I probably would've just picked out the meat and left the bun. It's a good one-time buy, but I would probably not buy it again."}
{"text":"Had the peameal bacon sandwich after seeing it on Bourdain like everyone else.  I think I was expecting a little more.  Tasted a little plain with no condiments - just the peameal bacon on a bun.  They should probably add some mustard or mayo or something."}
{"text":"Good Toronto staple - Peameal Bacon on a Bun.  Canadian bacon served sliced on an excellent grilled Ciabatta roll.  

Choice of different sauces including Barbeque, Horseradish and different kinds of mustard including grey Poupon to customize your experience.

We were able to divide the Pea meal bacon on a bun to three different sandwiches so that we could try the other goodies in the Lawrence market."}
{"text":"Reviewed by all the food shows, the Peameal Bacon Sandwich at the Carousel Bakery lived up to expectations. It was a little dry by itself, but they have a bunch of different sauces to put on the country bun. Mayo worked out very well. Reasonable price too."}
{"text":"Ah! Do not waste your money on the peameal sandwich! I only tried this place because it looked like the \"canadian\" thing to do....it tasted like battered SPAM on bread.............. enough said. Goodbye."}
{"text":"Before our trip to Toronto, the hype about Carousel Bakery special sandwiches \"Pea meal on a Bun\" for $6.95 Canadian currency, cash only...brought to our attention.  Here we are, bad luck, the sky cloudy, rain etc..were there at 7.58am, parking $10.00 Canadian currency all day.  The mood set not good, raining & cloudy.  The door opened at 8am, we were right at the Carousel Bakery.  My confident he got a \"Pea meal with Bacon on a bun\" & I ordered a breakfast sandwiches with pea meal, eggs & cheese. It;s early, Carousel Bakery, the only place at the moment has more customers, the line not too much...I kind of disappointed, the pea meal very salty, but with cheese, eggs mixed together much better than the traditional pea meal with bacon on a bun which my confident  ordered.  Anyhow at least we tried, this is one of Toronto places on our check out list for a day trip from Niagara Falls, New York."}
{"text":"The peameal bacon sandwich is a Toronto celebrity. Of course I had to try it!

My experience with bacon sandwiches is mostly limited to the gorgeous bacon butties found down at the local bakery in any UK town. These luscious sammies consist of salty, fatty soft bacon smothered in some version of a roll lathered in butter. The butter is the key part of the butty in my opinion.

Bearing this all in mind, I was quite excited about the peameal bacon sandwich because I've never been able to find anything that matches my childhood breakfast butties in this part of the world. These kinds of expectations alone probably set the sandwich up for failure.

It's not that it was bad. It just wasn't all that great. The pork was pretty good, but a little dry in my opinion. And there just wasn't that much butter on the bread. Overall, the sandwich is definitely worth trying and certainly something that I would eat again, but I wouldn't go as far to say that it's world-famous or remarkable. It's a nice Canadian bacon sandwich."}
{"text":"Had their veal sandwich 1 time... dream about it for a while longer. Just a great combination of sauce, chili, meat vs panko, soft bread and PRICE! Super cheap for a large portion. 

The service is pretty spot on and quick as always. 

Great area behind on the outside area to sit on. 

Will be back to try their other offerings...but might not make it past the sandwich again!"}
{"text":"Updated. It's still good, but it's been bumped to 4 stars because avenue open kitchen makes a way better peameal. 

It's a big tourist spot, so if you don't like lines, you may want to avoid the weekends. But this place is popular for a reason. It's a stack of delicious peameal bacon on a bun. It's a classic. A lot of people don't know the history of peameal and the significance of this sandwich in Toronto, but it starts right here at St Lawrence Market. Peameal bacon was invented right here in the market in the 1800's when they used to roll the pork loin in cornmeal as a way of preserving the meat (since electric refrigeration didn't exist yet). After rolling the whole pork loin, they used to hang it on hooks by the windows of the market so the cool breeze of the lake would keep the rolled meat cool. (the market used to be on the lakefront before the city was built out further onto the lake) 

So peameal was made as a way of preserving the meat originally, but obviously they struck pink gold. The stuff is amazing. So if you're eating a bacon sandwich at carousel, you're eating a truly traditional and historic Toronto dish. This is the taste of our heritage. And this is where it all started. 

I love it because it's all about the bacon. It's just a bun with a stack of meat on it. Grab some sweet or spicy mustard on the side if you want. They don't usually tell you that it's there."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to check out the St. Lawrence market for breakfast one morning before heading to the Toronto Islands. We stopped by here and got the Peameal Breakfast sandwich and it was great. The bread is somewhere between a hamburger bun and a bagel, the meat is juicy and thick and the egg reminded me of a mcdonalds egg (but in a good way). Will definitely be returning when I am in the area again."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are tasty but best ever? Perhaps a bit of Toronto blasphemy. You have a few options, peameal bacon, breakfast sandwich (egg peameal bacon and cheese), chicken and veal parmigiana sandwiches. 

Overall, the best one was the breakfast sandwich. The slightly crusty and the soft bun takes it up a notch. Best ever? Can't really agree. I like a bit of runny egg and cheese to balance off the hefty peameal bacon. A good choice when you're cruising the market though. Try it once in awhile."}
{"text":"Always come here for their veal parmigiana with the spicy peppers and the pea meal bacon sandwiches. So hot, fresh delicious. Get them to cut them in half and bring a friend. The service is quick and friendly. Love coming here."}
{"text":"After being disappointed (and chucking my first choice - the seafood salad from the Seafront Fish market) I noticed a couple relishing some tasty looking sandwiches. They pointed out the carousel bakery. How did I miss it???!!! I was looking for the perfect lunch and gave up (hence the seafood salad).
I promptly ordered a peameal sandwich (cut in half please cuz there was no way I was gonna finish it). Tried 2 of the condiments - the sweeter mustards. 15 minutes later I looked down at an empty wrapper. Yep - I ate it all. Not in my usual wheelhouse of lunches (I tend to eat a light lunch) but it was so darn lip smacking good, how could I not finish it? Simple, flavorful, delicious!"}
{"text":"Good bread? Check.

Good prices? Check.

Good sandwich? Hell yeah. Get the peameal bacon sandwich - it's nothing like you would have had in the states with a \"Canadian Bacon\" sarnie. To avoid being disappointed, as them to put condiments and veggies inside - you won't be disappointed. Mmmm...think I need to go grab one now..."}
{"text":"My brother-in-law once held a theory on food: it's nothing more than a vessel for condiments. He would definitely love the peameal bacon sandwich at Carousel. Upon opening up the wrapper, I was a little bit disconcerted to notice that the sandwich was nothing more than just bread and pork. Perfectly breaded, succulent pork certainly. But just peameal bacon. Then, I looked left and saw a line of condiments to the left of the stand. Everything from mustard to horseradish to barbeque sauce was there to dress up the salty, yet subtly divine flavor of the peameal bacon. This is one Canadian experience I'm glad I engaged in during my Toronto trip. My deepest regret was not dining on enough sandwiches to perfect a flavor combination, but horseradish and Regina mustard definitely did the trick.

Note, I did everything in my power to not use the old Friends joke of \"Wouldn't Canadians just call Canadian bacon bacon?\" joke."}
{"text":"This is a O.G. bacon on a bun spot. A staple inside St Lawrence Market. Nothing mind blowing here but you get a great price on a great bacon on a bun. Lot's of mustard and other toppings to add. Nice quick snack stop!"}
{"text":"I was told that this is a must have when visiting Toronto. St. Lawrence Market is definitely an interesting place and absolutely loved walking around and exploring. 

The line for Carousel Bakery was not that bad, maybe 4-5 people in front of me, and the line goes by quick, so waiting is not an issue. Seating in the area might be a problem since there's just so many people.

I had the peameal bacon sandwich. It's incredibly dull. It looked and tasted very boring. The bread was very dry, dehydrated, and crumbly. The bacon was also very dry and not flavorful at all. There was a nearby store that sold syrup and other sauces, and my friends and I were tempted to go there, buy any kind of sauce, and just put it on the sandwich. 

Overall, I was pretty disappointed, and can safely say that I will not be trying it again when coming back to Toronto. However, after briefly skimming through some of the other reviews, perhaps I came in on a bad day. Regardless, from what I've experienced, I would not recommend it at all."}
{"text":"This was also at the St. Lawrence market and the outside appearance was so pretty and pleasing. It actually looked like a carnival. Of course it was crowded here too. I heard that the place was a good place to eat. Therefore I was excited to try their sandwiches. I ordered the veal sandwich and it was pretty good. It was a little on the dry side and not as filling as I thought. It was a very good plain burger of just the meat and buns. I bet there are more diff types of food that gives this place justice but I chose the one that didn't fit my preference. I would still recommend to other 
people and I bet I will go again to try something new! Remember this is just my opinion a lot of people still enjoy going to this place! 

Tip: the Bakery is well known but we had no room for our stomachs to buy one!"}
{"text":"My hubby comes here for their pea meal breakfast sandwiches every other Saturday.   It's always been a favourite of his.   I like the breakfast sandwich more then their normal peameal bacon sandwich.   Why?  The breakfast sandwich, while it has less meat, has more tender peameal bacon then the pure peameal bacon sandwich.   Also, I find the full peameal bacon sandwich is just a tad too salty.  

Tip:  Go early....the sandwich taste best with their soft buns, but late in the day they tend to run out and then substitute other buns in it's place, and then it's just not the same.

Oh..if you get your breakfast sandwich on a weekday in the morning, it's cheaper."}
{"text":"I came here to try the famous peameal bacon sandwich. I was hoping they would make it to order but it was already premade. Honestly, took a bite and wasn't impressed. It tasted like Canadian bacon breaded in some sort of crust. It was good, but I would not line up for that and pay almost $7. There is also very limited seating so you have to fight for a table, if not you can stand."}
{"text":"For the amount they sell, nice to see it a buck or 2 cheaper ($7.50 now).
The bacon is excellent, nice soft bun.  A staple of St Lawrence Mkt.
Worth trying, highly recommend avoiding weekends, crazy busy, the whole mkt."}
{"text":"It's simple.  It's tasty, and it's the closest thing Toronto has to a signature food.  The location, St Lawrence Market, is probably the most Interesting place in Toronto"}
{"text":"I asked for a peameal bacon sandwich and got exactly that... Have to remember to ask for the egg and cheese... can't wait to go back and get it... otherwise, my peameal and bread was delicious... plenty of peameal and made to perfection."}
{"text":"Famous for their bacon sandwiches, I tried the \"breakfast on a bun\" with two slices of lean peameal-style bacon, a fried egg, and cheese, served on a bun. It is a decadent, heavy bite to eat in the St. Lawrence Market. I definitely say try it, but not sure if it's something you can have more than once in a while."}
{"text":"Some might say you can get a peameal sandwich anywhere in Toronto and that might just be true. However, if you want to get the absolute best peameal sandwich on the planet you come to the Carousel Bakery! I took my friend from Connecticut to Toronto on Saturday and was given the task of keeping him as full as possible all day, when it came to meal #1 and a quick breakfast bite I knew that this was the only place worth hitting up. Located in the middle of the St. Lawrence Market, you can usually spot Carousel because of the Hurd of people waiting around it, luckily we were able to squeeze in and grab some sandwiches before the line got super long. Like every time before this, I absolutely loved my peameal sandwich and it filled me up right, my friend was blown away and fell in love with the place after the first bite. If you are from Toronto, just visiting, or even work here, just eat the dang sandwich."}
{"text":"Unexpected meals are the best meals.

It was my first time at St Lawrence Market and as i was wondering around i obviously started getting hungry because of all the food around me , i came across Carousel Bakery and decided to give their famous peameal bacon sandwich a try. Mind you ive never had peameal bacon before so i have to say i definitely was impressed.

The sandwich consists of straight up grilled peameal bacon stuffed in a soft fluffy bun. What i loved the most about it is the fact that it was not too salty and the bacon was crispy on the outside yet juicy on the inside. I decided to top mine of with banana peppers and a couple different kinds of hot mustard which definitely were the cherry on top !!"}
{"text":"One of the biggest letdowns on the food scene. 

What the hell is going on with people? How is it that a couple pieces of ham in between bread has gained a reputation as a sandwich to die for? What are all your tongues coated with? This is just salty and dry, not to mention boring. I have no idea what the fuss is about. Ya'll need to go eat a real sandwich. I'll make one for you."}
{"text":"I love bacon, ham and fried anything as much as anyone but I don't think the Peameal bacon sandwich is worth the hype. Look, it's good. Eat it. Like it. Enjoy it. I did. But it's not a stupendous work of food.

The sandwich itself has a plain, quaint look. It's just w bun with buttery, fried bacon. Simplicity, to me, is a virtue. 

But the taste is not overpowering. The mustard available as condiments is definitely needed. Definitely go try it. I just wasn't ready to give it five stars."}
{"text":"I'll admit it - I bought a peameal bacon sandwich here because my man-crush, Anthony Bourdain, ate here.  I frankly never expect the places he goes and are featured on his shows to be good - I've eaten at enough at his 'recommended' places to know this.  Some are jaw-droppingly good, some suck - but it's always interesting.

Also, it's cliche - but you have to do it - the supposedly 'world famous' peameal bacon (though I never heard of it prior to moving here from Vancouver) from St. Lawrence market.  It's like going to Chicago and getting a deep dish pizza or getting a New York bagel - it's nearly obligatory even if you know it will suck because 'you can't get it anywhere else.'

So, I plopped down around $7 bucks altogether and was quickly handed a pre-made peameal bacon sandwich.  Normally, I would have issues with this - but looks like there were enough slack-jawed tourists and sheep like me to ensure turnover was high.

The sandwich was very simple and good. It's 4 hearty slices of juicy pork loin on a plain white bun - no condiments.  Lot of flavour, subtle crust and really juicy - it is pretty salty, but you that's to be expected.

So now I'm in this weird spot - the place is a must-try if you are at St. Lawrence Market.  I enjoyed my sandwich and I would probably bring out-of-town friends here.  However, it is pretty damned unlikely I would ever say, \"Damn! I could really go for a peameal bacon sammich right now!\" So... 3 stars, I guess? (shrug)"}
{"text":"I thought it was a bit dry. I got so full right away. They put a lot of peameal bacon. If there were some sort of sauce then it would taste better. My mouth got very dry. It was a bit too salty. But i guess it's alright, I expected too much."}
{"text":"Anything with a fried egg is good-- so I wasn't surprised that I liked their peameal bacon sandwich. But it just didn't change my life like all the publicity states it will. I think if that peameal had been straight up pork belly, this review would be different. But whatever, it was my first time trying and hearing the words, pea meal bacon. I mean, what the hell is it? What a gross name. It's good though and you may as well stop and try the so called \"world famous sandwich\". Ooo it would have been extra good with some hot sauce. Yum."}
{"text":"While strolling through the St. Lawrence Market, we were dead-set on sampling something that Toronto was truly known for.  We were referred to the \"Famous Peameal Bacon Sandwich\" from the Carousel Bakery.  

The \"Country-Style Bun\" was your standard bulky sandwich roll, but its quality was pretty irrelevant.  The specialty cut of bacon was the true star of the dish.  It might have been a bit greasy, but the thickly-sliced meat remained lean, tender, and packed with flavor.  The sandwich was even more enjoyable when topped with mustard and hot peppers.

Even though I have just finished my lunch, my mouth is watering at the memory of this succulent sandwich.  I rarely indulge in fatty lunches like this, but when in Rome...or, rather, Toronto!"}
{"text":"had their peameal bacon sandwich + I fell in love. flavor + textures of both the meat + the bread together in your mouth is like magic. just putting together this review is making my mouth water thinking about it. a must try if at st. lawrence market."}
{"text":"Ahhhh the world famous Peameal Bacon Sandwich at Carousel. Even Anthony Bourdain's been here. Peameal Bacon Sandwich ($5.50) - Canadian Bacon [boneless pork loin rolled in golden cornmeal coating] on a Kaiser Roll. It doesn't really taste like American bacon; it has way less fat. It's pretty dang good, very rich in flavor, however, it'll get really salty after awhile.

Overall - The peameal beacon sandwich's pretty good. Since they're always constantly making these sandwiches, service's really fast. You'll get your food in a minute. This place only takes cash only btw.      **3 1/2 stars overall**"}
{"text":"First time that I've ever had pea meal bacon sammich but if I'm going to have it...may as well have it from the place rated #1 for this Canadian specialty right? They didn't disappoint. The sandwich was filled with their famous bacon which is just salted pork loin. It was delicious. I saw some people eat it with tomato which would add some moisture to the sammich. I'll be sure to try it that way the next time I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Carousel Bakery's peameal bacon sandwich because Anthony Bourdain featured it on his Toronto episode.  Damn, I was so disappointed.  How could you steer me wrong, Bourdain?

It's basically bacon between two bread.  I'm not sure why I thought it would be anything else, but I did.  It was around $6.00, too salty and I couldn't finish it.  

I can't give this place anything lower than 3 stars since I haven't tried anything else.  Maybe the peameal bacon sandwich just wasn't for me.  When I visit again, I'll make sure to try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Okay...okay. I tried the Toronto famous peameal bacon sandwich. Three bites in it was delicious. I added a touch of Dijon & all was well. However midway through I forgot how tasty the bread was & could only focus on the layers of this salty, fatty, porky thing. My stomach wouldn't let me finish it. Perhaps if they actually added ice to my iced tea I'd be refreshed enough to finish it."}
{"text":"All I really knew about Canadian bacon was that it's one of a litany of items (maple syrup, reindeer, moose) that I associate with our friends north of the border. Apparently, it's a bit more than that - and a lot tastier than the bastardized versions than I've sampled in the U.S. After wandering through St. Lawrence Market a bit, we decided to try this after saying this was a Toronto tradition and world-famous (yes, as a tourist, I was a bit of a sucker for the advertising). Nevertheless, we happened to get in when the line was short, so we grabbed one of the peameal bacon sandwiches. Very straightforward as advertised - you get a nice stack of bacon in a roll, nothing else. I think it's easy to complain about there not being any additional condiments included, but that's all I want - a bunch of meat between a warm bun, thank you very much! The meat itself is delicious - not very fatty at all, but with hints of maple and very flavorful overall. The bun actually does contribute quite a bit, as eating this wouldn't be quite as good if it wasn't something you could just stuff in your face and chow down on.

I'd definitely have the sandwich again, but they do run out of buns (we had one around 2:30 PM on Saturday), and I'd feel a bit short-changed if I got stuck eating it on anything other than a fresh kaiser roll. But it was worth the $5.50, and I'd definitely come back here to eat a full one for myself next time - no sharing!"}
{"text":"Toronto and the peameal bacon sandwich goes hand in hand.  How can I not have one of these cornmeal breakfast sammie while I'm here?!?  I got a bit excited and ordered 2 of these bad boys, on top of the Veal Parmesan sandwich as well.

Yes, I'd admit that it was Anthony Bourdain and The Travel Channel that spark my interest to this place.  Sadly though, I was not blown away by this infamous Canadian staple.  It was definitely worth trying and the meat was good, a bit salty, but the overall sandwich lacked the wow factor.  To be honest, it was on the dry side, but thankfully, we got a lobster bisque from a nearby stand to wash it down.  I can appreciate some sauce/mayo or even butter to go with it.  Won't mind having it again, but it's definitely not a \"must-have\" on my list.  

Food aside, service was great and friendly.  Staff behind the counter was courteous and welcoming, even asked where we were from and made suggestions on some of their more popular items."}
{"text":"Carousel Bakery is located in St. Lawrence Market. Be wary that there are long lines in the weekends, but it goes by quickly. They make the sandwiches to order.

Apparently the Peameal Bacon on a Bun ($6.45) is a huge Canadian Staple. It is exactly as the name implies: a couple pieces of peameal bacon in a ciabatta bun. This sandwich is a huge part of the city's history. The sandwich was very flavorful, but a little salty for my taste. I had ordered a lemonade and it really helped cut the saltiness of the sandwich. However, the sandwich was pretty big and filled me up. Great way to experience a taste of Toronto's history.

**CASH ONLY**"}
{"text":"Perhaps you're familiar with this scenario: it's Friday, lunchtime, your stomach is growling and your hangover won't subside. You need hearty food that will give you enough fuel to last through to the end of the work day. A place to go is Carousel Bakery where their menu items are delicious and easy on your wallet. 

Line-ups are inevitable but you only have to wait a bit. My order and transaction lasted for a minute, and soon I was sinking my teeth into a chicken parmagiana sandwich ($5.60) with mozzarella cheese, sweet peppers and tomato sauce on a fresh bun. It may be breaded chicken, so not the most healthy of choices but it makes me feel tired as eating breaded food normally does. If it's the summer, try to enjoy your meal outside, on one of the benches - just don't drop any morsel otherwise you'll be surrounded by pigeons who know a good sandwich when they see one."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, A peameal bacon sandwich is a glorified ham sandwich. I guess I shouldn't really fault the restaurant for my expectations crashing into the earth, but here are my knocks:

When you order the sandwich, the staff grabs a premade sandwich from a hotplate.  They don't even make it fresh for you, and honestly with how drive mine was I would assume it had been there a while.  

Ordering your food is also a little confusing because they don't have a designated order spot, instead you just walk up to the counter and hope someone takes notice that you were there before someone else. It's pandemonium.

They have a really good hot mustard that was the only thing that made the sandwich edible.  

If you want a premade ham sandwich from a hot plate, go for it.  Otherwise steer clear and head to the fish fry spot at the far end.  This is where I ate half my wife's lunch since I threw most of my sandwich."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast sandwich: plain bun with a few slices of salty peameal, slice of processed cheese and an egg. Just basic. But their coffee was good however it was 5am!"}
{"text":"Peameal bacon breakfast sandwich.

Learn it. Know it. Love it. Eat it again."}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever. Adored by many. They have a breakfast one with an egg. Oh man that's good."}
{"text":"Obligatory must try as a tourist, but by no metric is this kind of sandwich with peameal bacon some kind of impressive food item.  The montreal bagel place in the market is excellent though."}
{"text":"Okay...so I'm addicted to the pemeal bacon sandwiches!  Since 95% of my diet is healthy often vegan, isn't it okay to have some bad stuff here and there.  I say \"yes\"!  On the most recent trip to Toronto in July, this was the first lunch.  Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This is a kiosk inside the St Lawrence Market.

I ate a bite of an enormous peameal bacon sandwich. It had at least four layers of meat stacked inside. Not something I would regularly eat, but it was juicy and delicious."}
{"text":"If you told me several years ago that the food that represents Toronto is peameal bacon, I'd be like \"huh???????\". There's really not a lot of places to get peameal bacon, so how is peameal bacon the signature dish of Toronto? Either way, I decided to give this signature dish a try after living in the GTA for almost 19 years, and decided to try it at where it all started: Carousel Bakery.

Peameal bacon is basically Canadian bacon...and no, it's not what you think in terms of what regular bacon is. It's not as crispy, it's about the size of a slice of ham, and personally...it's much better than regular bacon.

Carousel Bakery is located inside the St. Lawrence Market, in the west end of the main level. It's quite easy to spot; look for the carousel like decorations. I ordered the peameal bacon sandwich here. A simple, peameal bacon sandwich. No toppings, no cheese, peameal bacon sandwiched between two hamburger bread slices. Just the way I like it. For ~$8, this sandwich fills you up very good for lunch! Oh, did I mention the peameal bacon is very juicy and delicious too?

If you've watched that Family Guy episode where Adam West said \"you gave me Canadian bacon instead of bacon\" and wondering what Canadian bacon was...well, it's peameal bacon. While not to the calibre of poutine and maple syrup as Canadian dishes, it's awesome in its own regard. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I'm going to make my thoughts on the Peameal Bacon sandwich quick:

My husband ordered a breakfast sandwich with peameal bacon.  I had a bite.  I didn't see what the big deal was.  Unless you are an absolute bacon FREAK, you probably won't either.

I was, however, madly in love with their custard tarts.  The pastry itself was far more chewy than those at Venezia Bakery in Little Portugal, but the tarts were creamy and sooo good.  I could've eaten one every hour on the hour while in Toronto.

We were here in the middle of the day on a Tuesday, and we did not experience a long line.  We also were able to get a metered parking space on the street without even looking.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for one of the peameal bacon sandwiches that I've heard so much about.  The service was quick as the sandwiches were pre-made (they seem to sell enough volume though that they were still hot and fresh).  The sandwich itself was very simple - just the bacon (lots of it) on a bun.  I was not offered any condiments and am not sure if there are any available.  The sandwich was tasty but I wouldn't say there was anything amazing about it.  Perhaps I'll try the breakfast on a bun next time."}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto and came to try the Peameal Bacon Sandwich it was cooked well and the meat was lean and the bun soft and fresh."}
{"text":"So many things to say about this place.... So little words to express my satisfaction... Buy every thing here people- your taste buds will thank you. I got 6 variety of tarts and their famous bacon sandwich.  Fyi, they have a table for day old bakery items at a discount"}
{"text":"The four stars are for the breakfast sandwich, which is egg, cheese, and peameal bacon on a bun. This is a solid breakfast sandwich.

If you just get the peameal bacon sandwich, you might be disappointed. The bacon taste good, but they put a lot of slices in it and nothing else. No sauce. You can add mustard for some flavour, but it's pretty dry and boring. 

And, it's a bit pricey when you consider it's just dry bacon and bread. So get the breakfast sandwich only.

(note: there's always a line up here on weekends, but a lot of it is people just standing around thinking of what to order or waiting for something they probably shouldn't have ordered. if you're in for the peameal bacon or breakfast sandwich, it's done quickly. So don't let the dumbfounded tourists/locals fool you. Just step right up and place your order).

3.5 stars out of 5.

{"text":"First meal in Toronto was a success!

After landing early from a red-eye flight, my friend and I started our Saturday off with a visit to the St. Lawrence Market. As we were walking around, we couldn't help but notice the brightly colored and ginormous Carousel Bakery stand, so we decided to try it out. In my research, I had come across peameal bacon as a Toronto staple, so I was curious about it.

There was no line when we walked up, though the length of the line varied during the 20 minutes or so I stayed around eating. It always moved super quickly though, so don't be scared off if there is one. They churn these babies out like crazy so you get your sandwich pretty quickly.

I opted for the breakfast sandwich with egg and peameal bacon for a little over 6 (Canadian) bucks. Not bad! My friend, who is vegetarian, asked if they could do a vegetarian breakfast sandwich for him, and they made a egg, tomato, and cheese sandwich. There's limited table seating, but we snagged the nearest open bench and started munching.

I wasn't blown away by the peameal bacon but did think it was pretty good. Instead of using the fatty cuts that typical bacon is cut from, the meat here tasted more like pork loin meat and was very smooth. It was a little bit on the saltier side and balanced well against the fried egg and bun. Overall I thought it was a very solid sandwich! My friend really enjoyed his as well.

Note that the St. Lawrence Market is closed on Sundays and Mondays, so plan your trip accordingly!"}
{"text":"Seriously love their peameal bacon sandwiches. The peameal isn't too salty, the bun is soft and with mustard I think I've found my match. 

Not an every day or weekend type sandwich but I think it's a great sandwich to have if you want a quick and easy, decently priced lunch at St Lawrence Market. 

Line up clears pretty fast. I always ask if they can give me more lean bacon and it still tastes good (maybe it's not lean lol). Try this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Googled Toronto food staples and Peameal was on the list. Yelp said Carousel was the best for it. 

Located in the St Lawrence Market. Street meter parking. Cash only. Sandwich came out quick and hot.

Peameal Bacon Sandwich - $6.45 - Crispy lean bacon in a roll. Meat was so salty. Needed some cheese, vegetable, or sauce to help cut the saltiness. Would rate it a 3.5 but it get a 3."}
{"text":"This place is over hyped in my opinion. The pea meal bacon sandwich wasn't bad but lacked in many areas. No toppings given and I just felt like I was eating a ham sandwich."}
{"text":"I was really into this sandwich. Pretty cheap, good portion, and fresh. Much juicier than the peameal we had at the other place and the bread was better. I think I agree that if you are going to try a peameal, try it here."}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times during lunch break and really only go there for the famous pea meal sandwich for lunch.  Which is very reasonably priced for the amount of sandwich you get.   I have been a fan of the pea meal for a long time.  The service is outstanding and fast  even during busy times which is nice because I am an impatient person.  I do not like to wait for my food.  Sometimes I get inconsistent pea meal sandwiches.   It is either to salty or just perfect. Not sure why but nonetheless its a very satisfying sandwich to hit your taste buds."}
{"text":"Best oldschool breakfast sandwich? Pemeal on a bun or breakfast on a bun are the way to go. Meaty, tasty, fresh and great quality. I'd spend my $5 here before Starbuck's or Tim's 7 days a week."}
{"text":"yea, just wow!  their peameal bacon sandwich was amazing!!!!  I don't know how else to describe it.  I love this spot, and the owner is so down to earth.  He doesn't come off like you are bothering him, even though his spot is so popular and so busy.  come by and check this little spot out!"}
{"text":"Genuinely warm and sarcastic staff. Had to get the renowned pea meal bacon sandwich which had to be at least half a pound of bacon in between two slices of bread. No condiments or veg on it. Had a variety of mustards and hot sauces on he side but didn't need it. 

Sat on a bench across from the bakery and took note of all the accolades from celebrities and chefs."}
{"text":"We came by here today about 8:30 am to try the peameal bacon sandwich.

It was  okay. Glad we tried it, since this is our first visit to Toronto and I had never even heard of it!   But it sure wouldn't make my list of 100 foods to try before I die!

It's a bun with some fried meat in it.  It's pretty dry.

Went on a Wednesday morning. Super cold and rainy outside.  Not many people in St. Lawrence Market so we enjoyed walking  around the entire place with no crowds......."}
{"text":"Gotta have the peameal bacon sandwich with mustard and banana peppers on it. It's awesome! Nothing like that in New York"}
{"text":"Went visit this little shop located in St. Lawrence market since Anthony Bourdain from  the travel channel The Layover recommended.
My sister and I both were disappointed.

Nothing special about the pre-made peameal bacon sandwich we had.
They were out of soft bun, so we got Italian bread instead. It was hard to chew.
We only ordered one to try it out and throw away the last 1/3 bite.

Won't trust the travel channel again after some many tries of this trip!"}
{"text":"First time here. I did enjoy the peameal bacon sandwich, however the service was horrible. I dealt with a miserable person who looked like she hated her job and every customer that ordered. There are other similar places in the building which I will try next time. Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"People love the peameal bacon sandwich, but I can't fathom eating a sandwich with only bacon!! Argh! So I always go for the breakfast sandwich instead: bacon, egg and cheese, and it's cheaper at just under $6! I also get the Portuguese tart for under $1.50. Though now that I think about it, I really don't like how chewy it is. Is it supposed to be that way? I prefer crumbly tarts. :)"}
{"text":"I tried this place because the peameal bacon sandwich is supposed to be a big deal but I have to say it wasn't all that. The bread is fresh but not particularly amazing. The meat was plenty so it was filling but it was too salty and just too much."}
{"text":"Love grabbing a peameal bacon sandwich or the breakfast sandwich (comes with egg and cheese), on Saturday mornings! 
This place is a staple for Torontonians, and nothing is better than loading up your bun with condiments and browsing the busy market."}
{"text":"I hate peameal bacon; it is too close to what I imagine cooked human flesh would be like.  Not that I imagine eating human flesh a lot.  Anyway...I skip the infamous Carousel sandwich in favour of a less celebrated but amazingly delicious alternative.  Oh my larwd!  Their cornbread makes life a little more worth living!  I have had their focaccia and it was good too, but it's that simple perfection of the cornbread that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Located inside the amazingly awesome St. Lawrence Terminal Market, Carousel Bakery has become world famous for their Peameal Bacon sandwiches.

Now, let me premise this by saying that I loved this sandwich ($6.00CD).  2 lean slices of peameal-style bacon, fried egg, melted cheese on a soft country bun - how could this be bad?

And while the sandwich is amazing, let's be honest, bacon/egg/cheese anywhere is awesome.

The Terminal Market is awesome and walking distance to downtown, etc.

A must try if in Toronto."}
{"text":"I know it's wrong to compete on sandwiches, especially when I haven't had Black Hoof yet, but this is currently my favorite sandwich in Toronto. Peameal bacon, topped off with banana peppers and all the sauces you want...I see you. Let's be friends.

The sandwich is pretty filling for its price, and although you might be tempted to get a breakfast sandwich (who doesn't love eggs, and the combination is actually probably tastier than straight up meat)...there is so much value added with the regular. I wish I had diversified and gotten croissants/egg tarts along with the peameal bacon sandwich...next time!"}
{"text":"Both the \"world famous\" peameal bacon sandwich and the breakfast sandwich (peameal, cheese, fried egg) are pretty damn good. 

There is always a crazy queue to get a sandwich, especially in the midst of summer when tourists read about this place in their Lonely Planet guidebooks. 

Regardless, the queue moves along fairly quickly and you can get your hands on a sandwich. The condiments are kept to the side of the Carousel booth and it can be a bit tedious trying to get near them as you wait in yet another queue.

I really do like the country style bun - it's really soft and light, not nearly as stodgy as a hamburger bun.

Overall, reasonable place but there are better, less busy food stalls in the basement of the market."}
{"text":"Peameal bacon sandwich.  From now on, every trip I take to Toronto, I will make a point to stop at Carousel Bakery.  For my readers who don't know what peameal bacon is - it is bacon cut from pork loin and coated in cornmeal, and it has a tendency to cause a gastronomical pants explosion.  It is a specialty of Toronto and Carousel Bakery is famous for it.

I only wish there was actually some kind of seating here other than the small benches next to this place."}
{"text":"I ordered a meatball sandwitch. A gentleman who was supposed to take my order apparently showed some discomfort regarding who I am. He called an Asian-lady clerk to take my order and retreated to the back. I told her \"Asian serves Asian? That's how it works here? It's unacceptable!\". I told her that I wanted to cancel my order and that I had nothing against her. 
She told me that's fine and I left. This is called racism, hello? I will never go back and encourage others to do the same."}
{"text":"Peameal Bacon sandwich is the main reason to visit.  I get a half order which equals two slices of peameal.  Add some maple mustard and you're good to go!

Great selection of well priced breads as well!"}
{"text":"6/24/15: I came here as part of a food tour, so I only had a chance to try one single item...

1. Peameal Bacon Sandwich:  This was the first real food we ate here in Canada upon arriving.  And OMG, the \"bacon\" is something else!!!  It's sooooooo tender and juicy.  I've never had anything like it before.  After this sandwich, everywhere we went and saw \"peameal bacon\" on the menu we tried it--and EVERY SINGLE TIME we were so disappointed.  Never found another version even close to as good!  Heard Bourdain featured this on his show?--normally I don't care so much about what those shows pick, especially what that silly eyesore Guy Fieri likes, but this time one of them got it right!  9/10.

Every place we travel to we always try to eat local food.  I asked many Canadians \"what is Canadian food?\" and was basically told there is none, unanimously.  But I think this Peameal Bacon thing is as close to Canadian food as I ever found here.  This is a must try if you're a foodie foreigner!

The score is based only on this one item.  Dunno how the rest taste.

5/5

#canada #canadian #peameal #canadianbacon"}
{"text":"Got the infamous peameal sangy. It was good but didn't blow my mind. A little too salty and kinda bland. Wish I ordered it with egg and cheese. Wish they'd offered that up I.e would you like egg or cheese on that? I didn't know it was an option. Crossed it off my list (going through the \"50 things to eat in Toronto before you die\" list) and don't need to eat it again."}
{"text":"Peameal Bacon on a soft country bun $6.45
- We didn't realize this bun was literally just the slices of bacon within the bun. It was just all a tad bit Too Much Bacon!! 

Breakfast on a bun $5.90
- We would order this one again. It wasn't overwhelming with only peameal-style bacon as the other one, it was nicely balanced with a fried egg and melted cheese. 

Tart $1.25? 
We decided to try this... it's custard, a little too sweet~! Probably would skip this next time and try the other tart they have."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big deal is about this place. I tried the peameal bacon on a bun sandwich since I had heard so much about it. It was too simple. Nothing special. The peameal bacon was well seasoned and had a good flavor, but to put it on a simple bun just ruined it for me."}
{"text":"It's possible Carousel Bakery makes food that isn't the famous Peameal Bacon Sandwich.  The menu listing other items, and the piles of pastries ostensibly offered for sale would suggest that's the case.  But I wouldn't know, because I only come here for the iconic peameal sandwich, loaded with thick, tender slices of delicious bacon, and cushioned in a soft, crusty kaiser roll.

I almost wish I hadn't written that.  I wish I was eating it right now.  

Yes, \"It's just some meat on a bun.\"  Or at least it is, if you follow the traditional advice of not ordering it with any toppings and not putting anything on it.  That's fine, but I think it's a mistake overall.  I like my delicious fatty bacon balanced with some crisp iceberg lettuce to lend crunch and contrast, and some regular yellow mustard to flavor the roll and play off the fatty saltiness of the meat.  To me, that's *THE* Toronto sandwich.  We might not have an iconic hotdog like Chicago or L.A. but dammit, we have an awesome contribution to the world of delicious sandwich fare.  

I like to bring American friends here and force them to eat this thing, while screaming \"THIS IS CANADIAN BACON!  WHAT YOU'VE BEEN EATING DOWN THERE IS HAM, AND IT HAS NO PLACE WITHIN THESE WALLS!\"  

And they don't mind.  Because it's a helluva sandwich."}
{"text":"How to review Carousel? If Toronto has an iconic food, it's the peameal sandwich. And Carousel makes the most famous version. The reality is that this is just average peameal on an average bun. No toppings, except the mustard you put on yourself. It tastes good, but it's nothing special. 

Of course, I get it every single time I go to the market with the kids. The history and the atmosphere of eating it at crowded tables in the middle of the market add up to something more. Get a butter donut from Futures afterwards if you're still hungry.

In a vacuum it's a pretty plain lunch. But the nostalgia value pushes it up higher. Try it for a true Toronto experience if you're in from out of town."}
{"text":"I dont think this was worth 7 bucks. It was such a mediocre food. It wasn't bad but I honestly dont get why people love this so much.. I think there is better food in toronto."}
{"text":"You are going to read a lot of opinions about this place on this page. 

Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  Always remember though - that some people are dull and have no idea what they are talking about. 

The main complaint of this sandwich seems to be the simplicity of it.  Meat and Bun. 

I would counter that complaint by saying that is actually the #1 selling point.  

Adding anything else to this sandwich is unnecessary.  What you have here is a beautiful fresh country roll. Then added to that is a large portion of the most perfect and tender peameal bacon you will ever have.  Trust me, I have made peameal bacon at home a million times, had it on the bottom of like ten thousand egg-bennies ...and never has the meat been so perfect as in this sandwich. 

If you find it \"too dry\" then you should first go to your doctor's immediately and get checked out for some sort of dry mouth disease.  

For me it is perfectly moist, the salty, ever so slightly sweet juice from the bacon absorbs into the bun at the perfect rate.  The bun doesn't get soggy or sloppy. It just takes on a perfect moisture consisting of bacon juice.  

Please name 3 condiments that taste better than THE NECTAR OF BACON. Times up - you can't. 

Truly a perfect sandwich.  And at $7 it is a steal."}
{"text":"Peameal bacon sandwich is heaven on a bun. Food comes out fast and furious and piping hot.  Btw- forget the condiments, you don't need 'em.  Peameal bacon Sammie is about $6."}
{"text":"Came to St. Lawrence market place looking for breakfast after having just landed and of course, being a tourist made me look over at the crowd that is Carousel Bakery. If everyone is getting a peameal breakfast sammie, then that's what i'm getting too! 

Having no idea what it is, I still wanted to try. Turns out, it was a pure bacon sandwich. Thick slices of bacon between 2 pieces of bread. That is literally it.

I ended up splitting it, and I'm glad I did because the bacon was really salty. The sandwich was really one dimensional in the sense that it didn't have any sauce or anything, just bread and meat. It was pretty good overall, but I would probably split one and eat something else on the side since it's pretty heavy."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to try bacon or peameal bacon. It is served nicely on a bun and then the magic happens when you get to mix their variety of sauces. I personally like mayonnaise with a healthy squeeze of honey mustard. There is no place like this in Toronto! 

While you are there, you can bask in the st Lawrence culture and heritage."}
{"text":"Carousel Bakery is a must visit place to grab a signature Torontonian food item: Peameal Bacon. Before visiting Toronto I had never heard of Peameal Bacon and I was obviously curious during my visit to the St. Lawrence Market when I saw gigantic signs advertising the \"World Famous\" Peameal Bacon. I ordered the Big Hog, which was the Peameal Bacon Sandwich with egg and cheese.  Wow this sandwich was full of flavor! The Peameal Bacon was tender, crisp and full of meaty flavor. The egg and melty cheese turned it into one of the best breakfast sandwiches I have ever had. I highly recommend a visit to Carousel Bakery."}
{"text":"We went to St. Lawrence Market after our morning run with the goal of trying one of Toronto's must eats, the peameal bacon sandwich.  Everything I read said this was the place to get it.  It was a Friday morning and early so we beat the crowds and there wasn't a line.

The peameal bacon sandwich is pork loin coated in cornmeal on a soft yummy bakery bun.  My husband and I decided to split one in case we didn't like it and to save room to try other Toronto must eats.  The sandwich was very good and I would definitely get it again on future visits to the area."}
{"text":"Three words - Peameal Bacon Sandwich. Now I'll admit, being from the USA, I have nothing to compare it to because this was the only Peameal Bacon Sandwich I'd ever eaten - but it was damn delicious."}
{"text":"I can see why this is a 3-star place. I don't regret eating here, both the famouse \"bacon\" bun and the egg tarts were not too bad; however, I will not become a regular if I live in town since it was really nothing special."}
{"text":"Carousel has become a go-to place in TO when I have visitors from out of town..... Consistently delicious with the simplest ingredient..... PEAMEAL BACON!!

Say no more, I'm a HUGE fan!!!"}
{"text":"Peameal bacon sandwich. Not sure what the fuss is about. Nothing except bread and meat... No other condiments. Not tasty and dry."}
{"text":"Peameal bacon sandwich is a must when passing through Toronto. The bacon is meaty and not too salty. Really good with cheese and egg."}
{"text":"Okay listen to me, because I'm only going to say this once, you hear? Okay. Are you listening? I have one thing and only one thing to say about this place. ITS FREAKEN AMAZING!

Everything about it is perfect. 

Great place for an early AM breakfast Pea meal Sandwich or a late lunch Sweet Chicken Parmesan. 

The prices are great as well. 

The food is amazing. 

The people at the counter are amazing. 

I love them and I love the food they make. 

There I said it. 

Now stop reading my comments and go to Carousel Bakery and have some fun!"}
{"text":"this is the best place in St. Lawrence to get the \"world famous\" peameal sandwiches, the location is absolutely great as it is right beside one of the side exits, which makes for a great in and out trip. the quality of these sandwichs are great, as every single time i have gotten sandwiches from them the meat is very clean (no fat) and a very ample sandwich. my only complaint agasint this place is sometimes the staff is a bit short, i know it happens and everyone has bad days, but over the last two years its becoming more of a habit. 
still the best peameal on the floor of the market place."}
{"text":"One of the ten best sandwiches I've ever had, and I love my sandwiches.  Wish you could get peameal bacon like that in the states.  Location only adds to the experience."}
