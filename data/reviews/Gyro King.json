{"text":"This was a typical mall foodcourt crap place. The two combo plates for $9.95 each was a waiste of money. The schwarma was dry and pulled out of a holding bin and thown on flat top to heat through. The combo plate had chicken and kefta kabob both dry burned on the ends and again pulled from a holding bin. The hummus was tastelss. This place has no redeamimg qualities even for a mall food court. Yuck"}
{"text":"I love this place. The bread is always warm and fresh and the Gyros are always incredible. Some of the previous reviews said that they pre cut the meat and put it in a warming bin, which is utterly incorrect. I have gone here many times and everytime I watch them slice the meat directly from the spit onto the wrap. This place is just delicious, and the meat they use is flavored perfectly and incredibly tender. I recommend sticking to the original Gyro and get it with a side of their house made hummus. It's just too good. Definitely true to what it is."}
{"text":"These people make the best Greek food ever!!! The prices are really reasonable and man are they FAST. The staff are a little standoffish but maybe its a cultural thing? Anyway, totally worth every penny! I get the regular gyro, sometimes with the fries which are heavenly! I branched out and got the chicken shawarma, delicious! You will be glad you came!"}
{"text":"Surprised to find a good Greek place in the food court at a mall! Ordered the veggie plate-all my favorites on one plate. The hummus, falafel,baba ghanouj, dolmades, tabbouleh were all spot on. The romaine lettuce in the Greek salad was wilty and needed a little lemon but, overall, very satisfying lunch on an excellent pita."}
{"text":"There is black mold on the food!!!!
Don't ever eat here you can get really sick. I told them and showed them after we already had a bite and they didn't care. So messed up"}
{"text":"This mall location was enjoyable: friendly gal, quick order made right in front of me, generous portions, good flavor, very filling... nice option in the mall food court if you're tired of the other chains."}
{"text":"Just visited Gyro King yesterday at the last minute just to try something new. What a great surprise in the food court! Tasty food and charming service.

We had the gyro platter and gyro salad and it was almost too much to eat. The food was good but my salad could have used more tomatoes and less dressing. The flat bread was tasty and soft, but the hummus was bland. Nice touch with the Greek olives on the salad but I wish they had been pitted. 

Great gyro meat, and husband loved the long-grain rice which I think had saffron in it. 

Service from the gentleman behind the counter was sweet and polite. Refreshing compared to the usual hustle from the food court employees. We got our order fast and he even inquired if we liked the food when hubby returned the tray. I think he might have been Greek judging from the accent. 

The prices seemed a little high but the portions were big and very good. We will return for sure."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. The food is consistently outstanding (the menu is amazing for a stop-in Greek joint), and the staff is stellar. We eat here probably 4 times a month, but when we take-out, they always make sure we have everything we need. I do hope they get a permanent sign sometime soon though, but only because it makes me nervous that they plan on moving. Lol!"}
{"text":"I came here and ordered a gyro with side salad and I really did like it! I love the taste of the gyro and the salad was different but in a good way.Pretty healthy I would have to say."}
{"text":"As I write this, I am still unsure of what I ate yesterday. But as the One Star indicates, I am not happy with the experience. 

For years, since the early 70's Kronos of Chicago has been the main supplier of Lamb and Beef cones used in Greek Gyros places. Yesterday, it seems that technology in the industry caught with the times and it was a very unsettling outcome. 

Normally meat is shave from the cone and put on your plate or Gyro. The meat continues to spin/cook until the next customer's order. Pretty simple and straight forward process.  But now the meat is precut and stored in a warming bin. It was so thin I thought I would get a paper-cut (see photo). 

There's an adage, if something isn't broken, don't try and fix it.  I say this because the color and taste was off and my gyro was bland. No taste at all.  

Sorry, I'll pass until folks realize that we consumers want something fresh, made to order. If I wanted cooked meat from a bin, I would have stopped at the burger boys."}
{"text":"An OASIS in mall-land!  I have no trouble walking past the current crop of chain food factories... only one has the decency to call itself a factory... as in the old spaghetti.

Here, on the outskirts of the dystopian food court of the Chandler Fashion Center, a small oasis of small-business pride and care, Gyro King!  Here you can enjoy fresh greek salad, generously adorned.  After walking a mile at 100 degrees from my middle nowhere ramada to get here (you want to know what's PRISTINE? -- sidewalks in Phoenix suburbs!), I may have been a little waxing-poetic about the salad, but hey, it's not FRENCH FRIES!

Tried the King's Gyro Combo - generous gyro with side salad and a drink for $6.95. Tasty.  Umm.  Couldn't resist sampling the hummus, I am an addict.  As PeeWee Herman would say, haha! c-rrr-eamy! 

The verdict, here in the court, is A-OK. Not going to dethrone my favorite mideast hideway in San Luis Obispo, Jaffa Cafe, but so welcome and somehow appropriate here in the sonoran desert.   One could quibble and niggle, but seriously, if you are in these parts and want something passing healthful, fresh and tasty, Gyro King it is.  Support independent, small business!  Just say no to Food Factories."}
{"text":"Good gyro meat for the mall. I'm on a protein kick lately so it's as much meat and salad as I can eat. I have the gyro platter and a gyro.....both were great. 
Thumbs up to this place!"}
{"text":"Gyros King is located in Chandler Fashion Mall in the food court.  It replaced what used to be Hot Dog on a Stick there.  Prices range around 6.95-9.95 for an entree.  The ambiance is the mall pretty much.

I went here for lunch with a few friends today.  Another friend of mine was raving about the hummus there.  I went with a standard Gyros Sandwich + Side Salad + Drink for 6.95.  It was a great price.  The salad was large with olives, peppers, feta, and beets.  The dressing was a balsamic.  Out of all the greek restaurants I've been to in Chandler, I was shocked to find this place had such a good salad.  The beets were an unexpected surprise, and the dressing was tangy.  The gyros had salad and tomatoes topped with gyros meat and tzatziki sauce.  The pita bread was warm and there was a lot of meat.  I think a few more sliced onions could've made it spectacular, but it was better than a lot of sandwiches I've had elsewhere.

It wasn't 5 stars because the gyros could've used just a little bit of onions and maybe something else, but it was fantastic nonetheless.  It's my favorite greek spot in Chandler now to go to."}
{"text":"This being one of the healthier places where you can eat at Chandler Mall, it's as good as any Middle Eastern restaurant you'd find in a plaza. I had the falafel pita for about $6.50. An additional Greek salad with a drink is an extra $3.50. Not the most economical place to go for that Middle Eastern fix. Their falafel is big and flavorful. Their baklava is well priced at $1.75. The two ladies there (one was named Zina) were friendly and served me speedily with a smile. I even got to try out my Arabic with Zina, ha ha."}
{"text":"This is Greek fast food in a food court.  For what it is, it's fine.  The portions are reasonably large, and the taste is reasonably good.  They offer a dozen or so items, either as entrees or as part of \"plates\" (with sides).  They also have daily specials.

The \"Greek fries\" are just french fries with feta cheese on them.  Honestly, the feta was pretty weak.  Better just to get the regular fries if that's what you want.

Not great, but not bad.  A nice change of pace from Panda or Sbarro or other food court kings."}
{"text":"I know its weird 5 stars for a mall restaurant but I have developed a love for this place.  I admit I have not tried the gyro even given the name.  I love the swarma. Love the humas.  Always super nice. Always fresh. And they have dietcoke."}
{"text":"First time to try and became an instant favorite. Me and my boy were fresh out of the movies and was craving something heavy. We wanted something fast but tasty so we were looking for choices in the food court. I noticed this \"Gyro King\" since I haven't seen it and tried the Chicken Kebabs and my man tried the beef one. OH MY GOD i wish i took pictures, it was so cute. There was a lot going on in my plate, like i think an olive hummus dip, long grained rice ( WHICH WAS SUPER GOOD), we had hot pita bread, greek salad ( ANOTHER FAVE) and some kind of cheese i'm not sure. Anyway to top it off, my man ordered some Baklavas for me it was amaaaazing. After eating, and being fully satisfied, my boy ordered another chicken kebab and the combo 1 plate i guess and some more baklavas to go for my parents. And of course when i got home, they enjoyed Gyro King's food as well. A nice treat at the mall, friendly servers, clean food. :)"}
{"text":"I have two other local Gyro places that would definitely put this place to shame. But for what it is - a Gyro place in the MALL FOOD COURT - it's actually pretty good. Portions and prices are reasonable and they have pretty much what you would expect as far as menu selection. 

Considering the other options, this place is a much needed alternative, so hit it up!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken salad plate....delicious!!! I highly recommend! I won't eat anywhere else in the food court."}
{"text":"Would never go back. I ordered a gyro without tomatoes and my friend ordered a regular gyro wrap. His was out in a few minutes while mine wasn't out for about 15. When he set my gyro out the person working the register remind him that there was no tomato so he took it by the trash can and picked off each tomato. When I finally got my food there was still tomatoes on it so I went back and complained, the man who made it got mad and threw it into the thrash can and made me a new one. 20 minutes later I finally got to sit down and eat but the gyro had cold thin meat on it and way too many onions. Too many good places to eat ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Great service staff made great suggestions and answered all questions with fast service! Even better food! Top choice for Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Umm how can I put this in words...GROSS! I got the gyro and I could only stomach one bite! The sauce was absolutely not authentic, runny and nasty! Guess I should stick to Niro's Gyros!!"}
{"text":"I love this place food is always good. Guy at the service counter knows my order by heart and always does it up.rught. love the fire fighters gyro salad it's my favorite."}
{"text":"Hubster and I came here for lunch last Saturday after kona grill.  I was surprised how good the food was for being in a mall food court. We each had the chicken gyro, pita bread, side of hummus and the pitas were served warm and soft.  The chicken was super tasty and fresh. The hummus was fine but a bit to thick and made me think they use mayo instead of olive oil. This is a acceptable place If your looking for a casual and quick place to grab a bite..good choice compared to what is offered in the food court."}
