{"text":"Closed! :( Same ownership at Yellowrose or Ellwoods!"}
{"text":"Bad food and even worse service. Do not waste your time or money. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and it tasted like it just came from the microwave."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Everyone is really nice and have become good friends with a lot of the staff. The food is also above \"bar\" standards for sure. Great drink specials every night and I have the biggest crush on Leanna (waitress/bartender). Some of the greatest times of my life here. Give it a chance"}
{"text":"I have been to fifty one on four occasions and I witnessed a fight on two of those four nights. There is a thuggish vibe about the place that I haven't seen since I lived in Myrtle Beach. The last time I was there, I did not feel safe and vowed to never return. I do not like speaking negatively about anyone, but if you want to have a good time without being hit on by thugs all night, i would suggest ANY other bar within a five mile radius."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! You got the Bo Show and cheap beer! What else can you ask for? Sexy bartenders and free pool. Heat lamp outside and of course crazy people."}
{"text":"I don't think this place is as bad as everyone says. It's a decent spot to catch a game, get some cheap drinks....and I mean cheap! Often they have $1/$1.50 beer specials plus they have reliable, standard bar food. Who doesn't love some greasy bad for you bar food every now and then? Their chicken fingers are bomb and the cheese fries come with some Cheese Whiz like sauce, which I love. 

Yes, the crowd gets a little questionable as the night goes on but I was usually out the door by 11P just when the crowd was transitioning over. If I was alone, I would ask one of the bouncers to walk me to my car or watch me so I made it there safely. Lots of space to sit, big patio area on the side, pool tables and conveniently located next to a Chuck E Cheese, what more could one ask for?"}
{"text":"Cheap beer, free pool, good food & service. That about sums up this local S. Charlotte tavern, plus it's located next to Chuck-e-Cheese, which has nothing to do with this review. Looking to play some poker...here you'll find a video poker machine...talk to the bartender about details. Menu is full of bar food, but they are know for their wings...fried, grilled, smoked (yes, they have a smoker) or any combination with about 10 different ways to cook them...yep...awesome! Large patio for outdoor dining (and smoking for you smokers). Great place to watch the game and they do karaoke ladies & gents...scream away."}
{"text":"I was already a couple beers in and just stopped by for some half price wings, so I don't know if I can give a proper review, but will try.

This place obviously used to be a midtown sundries, it still felt like it.  There were good beer specials and half priced wings, what else do you need?  Nothing special but a great change of pace to that mostly over-priced side of town."}
{"text":"I am the Trivia Queen of the Universe -- went to trivia there last night and it was a definite \"Meh\" -- only a few people were into it -- the bartender was playing with his friends ... the questions were way toooooo specific and the music blaring between questions was crap I didn't even recognize -- I'll skip this one and head over to the sister bar Touchstone Yellow Rose"}
{"text":"Okay, the waitress was friendly, that's really the only positive aspect of my experience here.  The cheese fries that I ordered where like festival fries or fries at an amusement park.  The cheese on the fries was pretty good, but there was bacon on top of them that I had to eat around (not specified in the menu).  There is one pretty sweet flat screen tv to watch football on, but the crowd is pretty boring.  I wouldn't dare sit on the lounge couches by the pool table or shine a blacklight on them.  I was excited to see that they had Red Oak beer on tap, but it was warm.  No thanks to Fifty 1."}
{"text":"So I decided to give this place another shot Super Bowl sunday.  Had a couple of beers and the chips/queso.  Well, it was some white cheese with tons of garlic.  No tomato's or anything else.   They apparently do have live music now on Fri and Sat but of course their website is never updated to show who the entertainment is.  Okay place for a beer/sports close to home, but I'd say just eat before you go."}
{"text":"I went here to grab some quick grub with some friends after a long day at the pool.  This place is very casual so any attire will do.

I ordered the fish and chips (fried tilapia).  After sitting there for 15 minutes the waitress let me know that my order would be another 20 minutes or so because the fish was frozen and wanted to know if I wanted to wait on it...wth?  Why didnt you tell me that 15 minutes ago?  I sucked it up and changed my order to the pork BBQ with collard greens and hash brown casserole.  The food that I received was actually pretty good and very affordable.  The collards were a tad bit salty but the hash brown casserole was delicious.  They also brought out some corn bread that is definitely worth mentioning.  

I almost gave them 2 stars based on the tilapia fiasco but decided on 3 based on the other eats that we had there."}
{"text":"Its a cool spot to go.. 
Nothing outstanding... only been here ONCE since it changed from Midtown Sundries.

I'll go again and may update it (my review) if something \"Review Worthy\" happends."}
{"text":"Perfect place to watch the game.  Staff is great, atmosphere is great, food is outstanding, and they have a million and one huge flat screens to watch sports.  They will always find your game no matter how strange your request is.  I once asked to put on a Duke lacrosse game and it wasn't a problem.  The food is the best bar food in town: wings, fried pickles, chicken Philly sandwich, and sliders all are favs on mine.  Great drink special every night too.  I am a regular here and can't say enough good things about this place!"}
