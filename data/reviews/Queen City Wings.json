{"text":"Wings as good as I've had here. Quick service, super friendly.  Give them a 
Try. I know I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Love the wings here! The customer service is great. All food is cooked to order,  so expect a slight wait but it's definitely worth it (fresh and hot food, I'll take it). I stumbled upon this hidden gem, through word of mouth and it didn't disappoint. I think I've found a go to spot for my wings! I had the crown town and all purpose whammy sauce, both are  delicious. Another great thing is, they have wing sauces I haven't had anywhere else (great difference)! I haven't tried anything else on the menu yet, but from what I hear you can't go wrong with any of the food items.

Overall, great food,  great service and the aren't too bad either.  I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Nice folks and great wings.  It's my little secret but not for long. They just upfited the place.  It's nice and comfortable. I'll be going back alot."}
{"text":"This is a distance from where I work, but I had heard so much about this place that I really wanted to try the food. I ordered some wings and fries and was really pleased with the food. The wings were a little overcooked and dry but still really tasty. I will definitely be back. Would have loved to eat my lunch there, but there was no A/C. They had a big fan blowing but it was not helping the heat."}
{"text":"Decided to try a different spot for wings for dinner and this place did not disappoint. Granted the place is not the snazziest. The wings were fresh made to order in around 20 minutes. (I went to nuthin bundt cakes while they cooked, it was a Friday night so I lived a little).   I tried a couple different flavors the triple whammy and all purpose just to have a variety. My  eight yr old was disgruntled that they didn't have garlic parm so he had to settle for regular fried wings. ( he gave the place one star) I was very pleased with both flavors that I received. The fries were crispy similar to the Burger King fries that aren't my favorite. The ranch was no name brand out of a pouch so that would be my only improvement I would have wanted to see.  I shared them with my mother and her friend,  we were all pleased with the saucy flavor from the first bite. Very tasty place and I will try them again for the seafood sandwiches or hot dogs next."}
{"text":"Don't let the look of this location fool you, these are the BEST WINGS IN TOWN!!!
The flavor is out of this world! These guys pay close attention to the quality of their food. We tried the wings and the shrimp tacos. Both were delicious and packed with flavor! And the service was awesome! Definitely somewhere I'll stop every time I'm in the city!"}
{"text":"Wings here are okay. I'm a wing critic so it's hard to overall please me. I ordered lemon pepper wings and the wings were heavily breaded and didn't have much flavor. I would try a more flavorful choice next time."}
{"text":"So I was able to finally try this place. The place is not to appealing from the looks of it but staff is very friendly and inviting.  I tried the Crown Town flavor wings. Which is a cross with lemon pepper and barbecue. Wings are made to order so there is a slight wait. Which I prefer instead of wings sitting out waiting to be dipped in sauce. The wings were cooked perfectly, not over fried. The sauce was good. It seem as if the wings were fried in the sauce instead of coating which is a plus for me. Wings had great flavor. I will definitely be back to try the other flavors."}
{"text":"MMMmmmMMM good!  This place was a nice little walk from work, so I decided to check this place out with my co-worker's recommendation.  

When I walked in, I felt like it was a very chill environment.  Nothing too fancy, I felt very comfortable in there.  There were four nice white table to sit at, a futon, and also a pool table.  I didn't get to stay and enjoy everything since I ordered to go, but I'm sure I would've felt at home.

I ordered a combo, which consisted of two hot dogs and fries.  It was pretty tasty, standard for hot dogs, but still delicious for lunch.  It doesn't hurt that it was for a great price as well!  Not bad at all.  I plan on going back to try out their wings.  My co-worker raves that their wings are so good, and I saw it today and I think I drooled a little at my desk.  I think I should have a bib ready for when I'm about to order the wings during my next visit."}
{"text":"The wings has no flavor. My wings taste tough and chewy like they were old. Although I liked the size of the wings they are too greasy. The customer service was great as well as the prices. However the taste of the wings and the frozen fries were not good at all. Most of my lemon pepper wings were burnt and I was very disappointed. I hate I wasted my money. But I did want to support a black owned business and try the place out."}
