{"text":"Came to vegas and found this mariscos place its near the strip food is really good we had coctel el pariente which its so big full of flavor also my husband had camarones chinolas shrimp w head with this special house sauce so delicious will definatley come back"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for two days and I decided to come to this seafood place. Customer service is good but the prices on some foods are ridiculous. 66 dollars for a cocktail???? I've been to other seafood places and the food is 10x better with a better price. Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We were able to try the cóctel de camaron y pulpo, ceviche de camaron, ceviche de pescado, the micheladas, and the aguachile. They were all sooooo good!!!!!! Even their water is good. The tostadas are deep fried and omg they go really good with the food! We also tried baked fish with steamed veggies and rice! My aunt loved it! The service was also amazing!"}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice but the Food sucked shrimp and octopus was over cooked. And not to mention was very pricey I will  never come back again."}
{"text":"The reviews on here have got to be family of the owners. We walked in at 1 pm on a Saturday, mind you I'm Mexican and know a good marisquería is packed on weekends........ The only people in there where the workers no customers AT ALL! So me still giving it a shot had my family sit down. Waitress came  to take our drink order: Pepsi, Dr. Pepper, prepared mineral water. Waitress comes back \"No Pepsi or Dr. Pepper\" ok Sprite please. Waitress comes back with the \"Sprite\" hubby takes a sip.... It's carbonated water. They forgot to switch on the syrup on their machine!! Comes back with actual Sprite. Time to put in the order.... Medium Ceviche, Shrimp Empanadas and pescado  sarandiado. Ok perfect we should be eating soon.... Waitress comes back: \"The cook said there isn't any empanadas right now\"  Hubby: \"LETS GO!\" And we still paid for the 3 sips we took of the drinks. This establishment is HORRENDOUS, UNPROFESSIONAL and the reviews on here are a complete misguide. Makes me question ever using Yelp again don't trust these reviews. I give this place a few months to bust. Oh and the reviews as well as the pictures are all from the same 3 people hhhmmmmm"}
{"text":"Horrible service. We walked in and seated. There was 2 party that came after us. They were service before and still waited 20 minutes. My husband plate came and mind nothing after I asked the wait 10'minutes later. She said it was being cook. So I told her to camel the order. She did not bother to refill the chips or sala. We had to get the waiter attention. Horrible Service!!!!"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot!! Was looking for some good seafood. So we found this spot and the Micheladas were bomb, had like two because they are so BIG! And the shrimp OMG was amazing they are called Cucaracha... so the name is nasty but I don't care they were the bomb!! The place is right down the street from the strip so we were able to uber back to our hotel! Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"the pescado sarandeado is a must try Also the tubazo is really good a tower of seafood micheladas are really good too"}
{"text":"First and last time here. Horrible service, horrible food. Just horrible all around. If I could rate no stars, I would. Had to wait over 10 minutes for silverware after my food was dropped off. Hot soda, no cup of ice. Server was not attentive, horrible experience all I have to say."}
{"text":"Well... just let me add that we this place is great! The food was very delicious and with reasonable price.. Maritza our server was very attentive . She was on top of everything.  Very sweet and nice girl.. wish other servers were like her.. and you can believe ima come back just for the great service she provided us.. Thanks Maritza   G Los Angeles"}
{"text":"Music from speakers the size of a small car - WAY too loud.  Restrooms are horrendous.  Kept kitchen appliances just outside restrooms - YUK~!  Not sanitary!  Waitress couldn't understand English, order was SO wrong.  Never heard of a Japanese/Mexican theme menu.  Pick a theme, will ya?   Restaurant as a whole was dirty looking.  Not in a good neighborhood.   Never go to this place."}
{"text":"Primera ves en el restaurante y la verdad la comida está muy buena y un servicio excelente. Micheladas están buenas y el ceviche de camarón estaba fresco."}
{"text":"ts the best place for mariscos and sushi such a nice and well atended place grate food and service grate music coming back soon i give it a 100%"}
{"text":"My first time there went there for Mother's Day the place is amazing I love seafood and all Mexican flavors and spices and Seasonings I would definitely recommend it.  It was a humble Mexican Seafood restaurant. The twinkie boat were amazing I had the oyster shrimp shooter. The shrimp and lobster made in the stone pot made for sharing was spectacular with tomato sauce everything was amazing."}
{"text":"First time here seafood was good and the Charola Borracha was the bomb. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great atmosphere. Price is just a tad high but well worth it. Definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Delicious! This place came across my yelp recommendations and my boyfriend and I love Mexican seafood and we never mind making the drive for good food! So we decided to try it! Maritza was very welcoming when we walked in and very helpful with the menu. I love aguachiles so of course I had to order that! We also ordered the prepared oysters and el pariente, which is a combination of seafoods mixed with pico de gallo. And of course we had to have Micheladas! Two thumbs up for those! They were super tasty! Although everything we had was very fresh and fEveryone was super nice and even the chef came out to check on us! We really liked that! I definitely recommend this place if you love seafood! I know we'll be back! And ask for Maritza...she's awesome!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday at lunchtime but it was completely dead. The place was nice and clean, but the food was just ok. Nothing to special about it. We had the camarones culichi and some tostadas de ceviche and they were pretty good except for the fact that the camarones tasted more like mojo de ajo with all that garlic they added.  I found the food to be pretty pricey for what they give you, but I guess overall it was ok. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here while I'm visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on eating, I was actually next door doing laundry, but when I finished decided to get something eat. As I walked in, the waitress were speaking in Spanish to me. I said to them I'm Filipino...a waitress named Maritza spoke English and helped. I give this place a 5 star because the food tasted great and Maritza's customer service was also excellent. If you're ever in the area and would like great food and great experience look for Maritza. She made great recommendations and let me borrow a phone charger when my phone died, which she didn't have to, but shows how she's really great with cutomers."}
{"text":"Excellent aguachiles. A lot of lemon juice.  And fast service. The staff was so nice. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, visiting from Cali. Had the mini ceviche tostadas.. one fish one shrimp and one scallop. They were absolutely delicious! Too bad everone attacked it before i could take a pic. The service was awesome. Aileen was our waitress. Super sweet, attentive and courteous. Ohhh!! THERE WAS LIVE MUSIC too! We'll definitely be back time and time again."}
{"text":"came in tonight with a friend been wanting to try this place after ordering take out from grubhub i had ordered the marlin burrito and ceviche pescado which i had fallen in love with the marlin burrito Maritza was wonderful and she had an awesome personality took care of us   right away her service was terrific will definitely be returning.   Maritza keep doing what your doing"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today.The micholada's were  super cold.We had the Shrimp cocktail (Cameron) and the shrimp cucaracha (that was cooked perfect w/bomb sauce).The servers were attentive and friendly.. Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service. Waitress did not write down our order and kept forgetting what we ordered. Piña water was nasty, we asked Waitress to take it back and she still charged us for it. Asked for he bill and had to wait 45 minutes for it. We were frustrated so we left the money on the table and left. Wouldn't recommend to come here."}
{"text":"This place was a misconception based on the four star review. We ordered the fish ceviche, campechana and oysters. All the food was tasteless and not fresh at all."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA and was looking for some good seafood Mexican style. Someone in my hotel referred me here saying it was the best! I ordered enchiladas de Camaron and the al mojo de ajo (garlic shrimp) the flavors of both dishes would everything I was hoping for! Place is clean, staff is friendly and they have a full bar! Perfect spot right off the strip. Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I needed to satisfy my craving for ceviche and didn't want to drive across town to our usual spot, I was looking for places near home and Pariente's popped up, it was nearby and had decent ratings so why not, right?   My boyfriend and I stopped by on a Saturday night, the place was completely dead and there was only one other table occupied. When we first walked in we didn't get any hello's or acknowledgements, despite someone seeing us walk in, we didn't know if we had to seat ourselves or if we had to wait for someone to seat us since there were no signs posted, after a minute or two, a lady who I assume is the owner told us we could sit anywhere we wanted.   I ended up ordering two ceviche tostadas and my boyfriend ordered one ceviche tostada and a few tacos. The tostadas were definitely lacking, they were packed with vegetables and almost no shrimp, it was such a disappointment. Service was almost non-existential here, we weren't really checked on so it's something they really need to work on. Michelada's were simple and served in oversized glasses, just beer, clamato, and tajin on the rim. They were little on the pricier side I'd say compared to other places who do a little more to spice them up.   Now the reason behind my one star review and the reason why I won't be returning..Unfortunately my boyfriend and I got a bad case of food poisoning with me getting a more severe case of it with all the works. I think I ended up getting the more severe case because I stuck to seafood for my meal. If you've ever had food poisoning, you know what a miserable time you have, I ate nothing the next day and spent the day in bed because I couldn't keep anything down. Terrible first meal here."}
{"text":"Spent a weekend away in Vegas & ate here. Food is delicious and restaurant is clean. I had the fish tacos.. they are filling and full of all the right flavors! We will be back next time we are in the area! Thanks again Yelp for the great find! :)"}
{"text":"Without a doubt the worst place I've been to eat in Vegas. The servers are good but the food is terrible no real good taste at all and I'm not exaggerating. Please skip this place it's not worth it."}
{"text":"had the shrimp tacos. 3 for $14!!! 2 little shrimps and some disgusting cabbage from a bag!  So sad and I see why no one was in there on taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"Perfect spot to cure hangovers. My boys and I were in need for beers and seafood after a crazy night. Found this hidden restaurant with the best seafood and bomb micheladas. The manager was dope they hooked us up with this cucumber shooters which hit the spot. We are coming back again this place is our recovery spot. Shout out to the owner, she's pretty cute."}
{"text":"Horrible food, and service... only one waitress attending the whole place. Shrimp had no flavor what-so-ever. They sprinkled tajin on everything! Stay away... not worth the time, or money... There's way better places available. I don't understand how they're still in business. I walked up to the cashier to pay, and it still took 15-20 minutes to be attended."}
{"text":"I was craving a little bit of Mexican seafood in my life I haven't really had any since moved to Vegas... This place is decent size... Free chips and salsa the salsa was delicious by the way not too thick kind of creamy... We ordered some micheladas which came with some kind of fish at the bottom and shrimp all around the rim along with some Tajin(Mexican chili powder) ....for main meal ordered a large Coctel de Cameron (shrimp cocktail) came with a ton of shrimp, chopped up veggies and avocado .Yum!!! Also tried the oyster shot which might I add looks like a mini brain but don't be intimidated tasted great on the way down the combination of chili on the rim followed by tomato flavor oyster !!!...the atmosphere is casual they had some old school Salsa music going which I love being a music fan !!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Very kind staff. If you're looking for delicious Mexican food and great environment come here. Great music selection and crowd! Karaoke on Fridays! Ask for Roxana she's the best!!!"}
{"text":"We came in and nobody in the front for a good 10 minutes. The aguachiles are very bland and not even spicy. The waiter was really nice and provided good service"}
{"text":"The best seafood fusion spot I've ever had. The server is super friendly. Seafood is so fresh. Salsa is a a little too spicy for me but I don't do spicy. Everything tastes soooooo good. Highly recommended. And I'll definitely come back soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a long day on the strip and were looking for a good authentic Mexican restaurant...well we found it. My husband had the campechana and it was delicious !!! I had he shrimp tacos and it was good . Food was fresh!Great authentic Mexican food. We definitely will be back. Also awesome service. Very clean and prompt service."}
{"text":"Feels like you are in Mexico until the food arrives then you know you are in Las vegas. Staff was friendly except one girl who stood like a statue and just stared at nothing, she scared me."}
{"text":"Outstanding service, the place was really clean. I tried the camarones chinolas and the mando margarita both very good decisions recommend by my waitress whom was friendly and well informed. Definitely a must go if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Just found my favorite marisco spot in vegas baby! Had some thing called a Tubaso. Like a tower of seafood. Was bomb! The coctel loojed good too. The best thing for me though was the live BANDA. I dont know if its eveyday but we went on a Sunday and they were playing really good."}
{"text":"Great place.  Great service.  Great food.  Waitresses are hot lol. I tried the micheladas,  oysters and ceviche.  All delicious.  Too bad I don't live in Las Vegas or I'd be there every day"}
{"text":"The wait was really sucky. And to redeem the 5% you gotta jump through hoops. The food was a 6 out of 10. For how much it was worth, you'd think it would taste better. We waited over an hour for our food and we are the only people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé stopped here before going out tonight and we absolutely loved it! The atmosphere was awesome with music playing in the background and soccer on TV. I had shrimp and carne asada tacos with rice and beans and she ordered a carne asada burrito. Be aware...the burrito is ginomorious but so delicious. Our waitress Violeta was super nice too! Will be coming back next time we're in Vegas for sure!"}
{"text":"Went in last weekend was so much fun live Banda right at our table ! Excellent service and food was amazing ! Love this place"}
{"text":"The shrimp \"chinolas\" are finger licking good  and Friday night karaoke is pretty awesome. You have to try the the tostada nabolato as well overall service is good the waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"Muy buena la comida, los mariscos  estan  frescos, excelente  atencion y servicio, los recomiendo, volveré  de nuevo"}
{"text":"Food was good but a bit overpriced. There are certain dishes that are better than others. Camarones culichu were pretty good according to the wife. My cocktail had a very hard cooked octopus!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for the first time and with this brutal hot weather it made me crave seafood so glad I found this place which turned out to be pretty authentic. They have the best Mexican food and fish tacos EVER! Love it! Staff were quite friendly very welcoming. I am definitely coming back to visit them again. Good vibes love the Karaoke I ended up staying past dinner"}
{"text":"I was in the plaza doing some business and had time to wait so decided to check this place out for lunch! So glad I did, very clean place and was kindly greeted and welcomed by Michelle (owner) who was patient and informative with my choice of what i might like to eat , nailed it!"}
{"text":"Good service, very good food, I recommend the chinolas shrimp, the green aguachiles, i love your micheladas"}
{"text":"Not one for leaving bad reviews unless I feel truly necessary but I came here because this place was on group on. Clearly states \"40% off seafood. When we arrived the waitress said she had no idea what that was. Seems like a bait and switch. Other than that the service was good and the food was decent."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I were in town and were craving seafood. Tried this place out but was horrible. Service was really bad, food took an hour to come, taste of the food was ok, but the price was way high for what we got."}
{"text":"Best mariscos! The service is good, the waitress was always making sure we were doing good. We had the agua chiles.... BOMB!!!! The micheladas were also tasty. The music that was playing was also good, love corridos!!! I am definitely coming back to this place when I visit Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! We had the oysters which were surprisingly fresh! The fried talapia was amazing and cooked perfect!! The margaritas are great! The spicy shrimp was good but will definitely try a different kind! Overall food is amazing and highly recommend it. Price is decent!!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas off and in for about 16 years, continuously on a quest for good Mexican food. My husband and I would often hit San Diego to get our fix due to Las Vegas just not offering what we consider a good spot. This place is the best in town hands down. The food is great, the prices are good, and the service was amazing.  It's still not quite old town San Diego, but it's very close. We had a great time and plan on returning."}
{"text":"The ceviche navolato was bomb . The tostada de camaron y pulpo was ok or maybe I was just excited about the flavor of the navolato tostada."}
{"text":"I ordered carne asada tacos that had a seafood taste to them. Not sure how or where the meat was prepped or cooked, but couldn't even finish the food. I was the only person in the entire restaurant with the food server. I didn't care for the loud Banda music either. I had driven past this restaurant and was curious but now I'm sorry I tried it out. Eating options on the menu seemed overly priced."}
{"text":"Great flavor, we try the oyster shots and tubazo, what a great choice. I definitely recommend it if you love seafood."}
