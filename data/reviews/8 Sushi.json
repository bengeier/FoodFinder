{"text":"Unfortunately they do not include tuna on their \"all you can eat\" menu it is extremely misleading. When we asked the waitress they dismissed us and walked away.... will be the last time we bring our family to this establishment."}
{"text":"Went here for my sons birthday with our family of four, he was very much looking forward. Food was mediocre and many items were forgotten. The Basil chicken looked nothing liked advertised and was completely inedible. Very disappointed, won't be back."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time this past weekend and enjoyed it, they have a decent all you can eat menu and the quality is pretty good. I recommend this to locals, but likely wouldn't suggest making a long trip as there are probably comparable places in other neighbourhoods. I wouldn't rate it a 5 star because tuna wasn't on the all you can eat menu (personal favourite), they don't serve liquor and the service is a bit slow - but all in all a nice all you can eat sushi! *Discount if you pay in cash."}
{"text":"No! No! No! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. If they have 0 star I will give it to them. I went there and eat with my family. I found 3 different pieces sushi have hair in it! I show it to the waitress and she gave it to the manager. They didn't do anything. They should shut this place down. Horrible!"}
{"text":"They deserve 5 Star, because they fulfilled all of our orders, even when we were ordering large amounts.  The food was like most 4 star sushi restaurant, however the customer service, always . We had a large group of 7 and they were very friendly, and always came by to asked if we needed anything.  Summary -Food came Quick -orders came through tablet -staff spent time to assist us -Fulfilled exactly the order sizes  Update Nov 10 2017 The place food is decent. The sushi rice fall apart when picked up with chopsticks. The sushi lacks the level of freshness. Please be prepared, if you are going out with a pair of two,  because tips will automatically be added on to you."}
{"text":"This new AYCE sushi place used to be called T&A but now called 8 Sushi.   We went for a late dinner on a Sat night and were promptly seated. Our order was put through an iPad which had all the pictures of everything available.  The sushi and cooked foods were all very good. We had the Tum yum, hot and sour, and miso soups. The mango salad, seaweed salad, and the octopus salad (was not my fav).  We ordered the beef tataki, grilled octopus, grilled short ribs, mussels, pan fried scallop, octopus fried ball, shrimp tempura, beef wrapped in enoki mushrooms, beef teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, salmon belly, mackerel.   We ordered the butterfish sashimi, mackerel sashimi, surf clam, octopus, and fish roe sushi.   For the rolls, we ordered the spider roll. It was delicious! We also ordered one serving of the beef fried rice.   For dessert, we had green tea ice cream, red bean ice cream, vanilla ice cream, fried banana, and fried milk.   The service was excellent. The food came promptly and they refilled our water frequently.   The price was $25.99 since we went on a Saturday night (usu $22.99 M-Th) and children 2-4 are $2, children 5-12 are $15.99 ($12.99 M-Th) and seniors $22.99 ($20.99 M-Th).   They have a lunch special for $7.95 and $9.95 for a set lunch menu. For AYCE at lunch time is $16.99 ($14.99 M-Th).  For their grand opening they offer 20% off so I would recommend trying it before the promotion is over."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the AYCE lunch buffet ($14.99 weekdays, $16.99 weekends).  I came alone so didn't get to try too much variety but I enjoyed everything I ate.  The space was newly renovated and quite spacious and much bigger than I thought it would be.  Came on a Tuesday (after a long weekend) and there was only one other table when I arrived, but I would say about 10-15 other parties came in while I was eating.  The tablet system works well and I like that you can check to see what you have ordered in the past to see what they may have missed (they forgot one handroll, but it was near the end of my lunch and I didn't mind because I had more room for extra dessert).  The servers were efficient and did a good job of answering my questions and submitting my orders/refilling my tea etc.  I ended up having multiple orders of the salads - seaweed, mango and avocado salads were all fresh and tasty.  Rolls did not have much rice and were not too saucy or too big (which I like because I can try more things).  Didn't try too many of the Chinese-style dishes, but they had deep fried squid tentacles which were just like the ones you get at dim sum.  I liked the creme brulee (although I didn't end up eating the sugar crust, just the custard, and the deep fried milk was not too sweet and would be good for someone trying to avoid sugary desserts.  Overall I would definitely return.  The weekend AYCE lunch apparently includes three kinds of sashimi -  salmon, butterfish and crab meat (weekday AYCE does not include sashimi).  Also until June 30, 2016, if you pay with cash you save 15% and the weekend dinner AYCE gets you two crab legs and two steamed scallops too."}
{"text":"Love this AYCE sushi place. Service is friendly and efficient. Food is good. Prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Tl;dr: this place is awful. I'm in shock of the people that have given this place 4 or 5 stars.   Upon arrival, there were a lot of people seated and I thought that was a good sign. Nope. To start, we were only given the all-you-can-eat menu and weren't given a regular menu. We were finally given a regular menu and different servers kept coming around and taking them away from us. All around they are very pushy with the all-you-can-eat option.   So my friend and I decided to go with the all-you-can-eat in the end. We ordered the first round of plates. Salmon nigiri- the best thing we ordered. Mango salad- it was fine but kind of really lame, bell peppers, onions and mango. Weird. Miso soup- completely flavorless, with one piece of tofu. How can you screw up miso soup? Mango fusion roll, crab tempura roll and pink lady roll were fine but nothing I would ever get again. Their wasabi is completely tasteless as well. We had to ask for wasabi and ginger because it wasn't even brought out with the rolls.   Second round. Shrimp tempura- gross, so much batter that didn't have the taste or texture of actual tempura. Seaweed salad- did not taste fresh whatsoever. Butterfish nigiri- fine. King crab legs- disgusting and the shell looked brown and old. Green tea ice cream- nasty, freezer-burned.   Do not waste your time and money on this place because my friend and I were basically gagging at most of these items. In our three days visiting Toronto, this has been the worst and most expensive meal we've paid for."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've been there twice, both times were amazing. The staff is always polite, the sashimi and sushi were fresh. The price for lunch was $16.99 per person for weekend all you can eat. It's a great deal because it includes salmon and butterfish sashimi. You use an iPad to order and the selection was sufficient. I've been to many ayce places and this is one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 8 Sushi five stars not because it's five star food, but because it's worth a top rating when you take into account my own experience with the food, the service and the choice (including a range of Thai and Chinese options that allow you to satisfy a group of friends).. and the price. This is an All you can eat that's worth checking out if you are looking for that in the Danforth area."}
{"text":"This is a very good AYCE place, the sushi is just as good as anywhere else, it's fresh and tasty, well presented and clean. I would recommend it to anyone. My ONLY issue with this place is that it doesn't close late enough, and the price of their AYCE is higher than what I'm used to for this quality in town. I payed 30 dollars and it could honestly have been reduced to less than 25 in total. They would really need to lower their prices for me to come here much more often."}
{"text":"I'm sure the sushis were good but THIS PLACE DOESN'T SERVE ALCOHOL! Imagine a sushi dinner without sake!? You order the all you can eat menu with your designated iPad which is cool and trendy and make your orders fast. We were really not prepared for a dry dinner or coca-cola date... so that part was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time since they first opened and things have really gone downhill. From what I remember the service was way quicker before & the quality of food was better.   The restaurant was basically empty with a couple other tables on a Sunday evening but the food took forever to come to our table??? We got our sashimi & sushi last, it was basically warm. The rest of the food was average, it wasn't worth for ayce. As there are so many other options out there, I totally regret coming to sushi 8 for convenience sake.   PS. The iPad is glitchy so you get items that you didn't order, which is why you should double check your orders...."}
{"text":"Disappointed after going for weekday AYCE lunch after reading the reviews here. You order items off an iPad and for the most part, food came quickly. The spicy salmon and salmon tempura rolls were tasty, but as a fan of eel, the eel avocado rolls were bland. The eel sushi however was a little better, and a good portion was eel rather than rice. Desserts include green tea, red bean, vanilla, strawberry ice cream, black forest cake, mango mousse cake, mocha mousse cake, deep fried banana and deep fried milk.  Avoid the thai curry chicken as it cold and felt like it was just heated from frozen. Had 2 rolls that had hard rice too."}
{"text":"Sashimi was good. Maki rolls tasted funny. Entrees were over cooked or not enough flavour.  Noodles were bland.  Do not over order. They will over charge."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.   Food quality was very good. Restaurant is clean and service prompt. You order from iPads which is convenient. All you can eat dinner price is $23 which is very fair.   Things that would make it 5 star: - larger variety of sashimi - staff being more personable"}
{"text":"This is my go-to AYCE sushi resto in TO - the sashimi is worth it alone - always fresh & good -plus lots of options from the menu to choose from - never a bad meal here & fast service - don't miss it"}
{"text":"High quality food in a spartan atmosphere with interesting deserts. But no tuna for the all you can eat. The regular menu bento box is twice the size of other places and is very high quality. Friendly staff. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Sadly, 8 Sushi is closed due to a fire last night: http://www.680news.com/2018/04/12/fire-danforth-sushi/  It was about 04h30. Happily, there were no injuries. There were still fire trucks on scene around 08h15 when I passed by. I passed by this evening on my way home and there were two Metro Police cruisers there, which is not a good sign (probably means it's being investigated as arson.) They of course had no idea if/when it will reopen so I have reported it as \"Temporarily Closed\" for a one week period as Yelp won't allow this status without a date... April 19th is NOT certain.  Edit 2018-Apr-14: Yes, it's being investigated as arson by the Ontario Fire Marshal. http://torontosun.com/news/local-news/blaze-at-greektown-sushi-restaurant-deemed-suspicious  Edit: 2018-Apr-18:  I spoke to contractors onsite today and they indicated it will be \"a while\" longer to make repairs so I requested to change the temp. closure date to Apr. 26. No one knows differently who is saying.  Edit: 2018-Jun-26:  The temporary closure notification expired Jun. 23. It's still closed as of today; if it doesn't open soon I'll submit another one.  This was our favourite weekend place to eat and it's going to be hard to replace... I hope it's back open soon."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. I've gone to this resto for lunch and once for dinner. First time we were there, we waited 30 minutes for food at as the waitress did not clear the ipad from the previous customer, so our orders were not going through. If i didnt ask 3 times, no food would have come. Their food is mediocre, nothing special about it. Gave it one more try for dinner and the service yet again wasn't great. Had to ask numerous times for tea and the Har gow we ordered was genuinely disgusting. I've had Har gow as it's one of my faves (shrimp dumpling -dim sum) and it tasted like it had gone bad. The black pepper beef was tasty though and their sashimi is pretty good. their Calamari rings were over cooked, hard and chewy . for $30 bucks with tax and tip for dinner, you're better off trying somewhere else, say Matsuda or Spoon and Fork in the Area."}
{"text":"The ipad ordering system was very glitchy compared to other places. The AYCE was priced several dollars above the others in the area but only provided a small few sashimi options. The food was delivered quickly, nothing was forgotten, and it was edible but nothing to rave about. Dessert was the worst part of the meal. The creme brulee was basically jello. We also ordered \"fried milk\". It's basically snot somehow crafted from milk, wrapped in a golden brown deep fried coating and topped with mayo (which looked like a delicious frosting drizzle, I had to taste it four times to really convince my brain is was definitely mayo) and the entire thing is completely unsweetened. It didn't tickle my Canadian palate. Maybe an acquired taste. It's ok, but not good, so I won't bother going back."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Oh gosh, doesn't knock off a full star but I'd say it's closer to 3. The masago is sooooooo gross, I dined here about 5 times and I tried their masago sushi 3/5 visits just to make sure it wasn't an off day- it tastes like dish soap. Very understaffed, there's only 1 sushi chef for 4 tables so it takes about half an hour for each round to come out.   On the bright side, everything else seems to be consistent and the servers are quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent AYCE Japanese/Thai/Loosely Chinese restaurant on the Danforth (we have been seriously lacking)! Sushi 8 (or 8 Sushi, formerly known as T&A) offers lunch and dinner AYCE, and some a la carte items. They are no longer offering 20% off. The restaurant is modern and clean, with ample seating. What I liked (which is a rarity on the Danforth) is how the tables were set far apart enough that you aren't rubbing elbows with the diners next to you. This restaurant is wheelchair accessible.   Weekday lunch ($14.99) is an incredibly good deal. Ordering is done on iPads, and is confirmed by a waiter. I didn't like how some menu items didn't have photos - however, the waiter was able to quickly tell us what the food was (especially regarding sushi rolls).   Once we ordered, the food came out quickly, and none of our items were missed! Even though there was only one waiter servicing the room (5-6 small parties), he was super efficient and was fast to accommodate our cutlery/tea/water requests. Food wise, the sushi tasted pretty fresh. The rolls had a thinner layer of rice, which I prefer, and were neatly made. The miso soup was watery, and the takoyaki wasn't flavourful (don't recommend). The thai items I tried (curry beef, basil chicken, mango salad) were surprisingly good - the meats were tender, sauces flavourful and not too saucy, and the mango was crunchy and sweet. Creme brulee (here? Yes here) was interesting and not terrible, but seemed more gelatinous than custardy to me.   While the food was better than average for AYCE (standard selection of rolls, nothing special, except for the random addition of chinese siu mai on the menu), the service was great."}
{"text":"Easily the best sushi I've had at an all you can eat place. I had a bit of most of the menu and it was all great. The dim sum was pretty good too.   Ambiance is nice, uses a tablet to order which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I ordered a delivery so I can't comment on how the restaurant itself is.   I ordered salmon lover and tuna lover sets. Both are very affordable so I adjusted my expectations. I was shocked how good the quality of the fish was. Tuna was fresh and especially tuna maki absolutely melted in my mouth. Salmon was very fresh and tasty as well. Excellent quality at this price point.  The sets came with salads and they were delicious. Miso soup tasted kind of odd - maybe they tried to create their own spin on it but this little detail can not take a 5 star rating away. Amazing value if you're looking for good quality comfort sushi."}
{"text":"Im surprised by the high ratings on this place. I decided to try this place based on the reviews. I was disappointed rude service and nothing tasted good. Everything was bland or stale tasting. Definitely wouldn't go back if someone paid me."}
{"text":"I live very close to this restaurant so I have been here many times. My boyfriend and I love going for lunch AYCE, for $14.99 we really get our money's worth!  The sushi and rolls are quite good. Often the sushi is cold and the rice is warm so you know they're making it fresh.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I sometimes ask for modifications and they always come through!  Sometimes the iPad is glitchy, but the staff are good about it.  I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there with my husband.  Food was fresh and a lot of options and varieties.  The only drawback was that they do not have their liquor licence yet, so drinks were limited.   It was our second time back and food and service were both consistent."}
{"text":"Tablet ordering for all you can eat gives them and extra star.  Very smart idea.  And it doesn't cost much. Pictures of each dish. Why don't all places do it? Very clean. New furniture. Opened three weeks ago.   The food is amazing !!! Not cheap at $23 per person AYCE dinner but the quality is amazing ! Sashimi is fresh, sushi is just right, Thai food could be better, but hey THAI in all you can eat sushi place! The izakaya is just as great , everything is very fresh and very well prepared. The deserts are ice creams and custards with an amazing Creme brûlée, albeit in a tiny cup (by dessert time you won't have any space left ).   Indeed this is one of the best AYCE sushi places in Toronto and definitely the best on the Danforth."}
{"text":"The sushis were OK.  But all the fried stuffs were cold. Plus it took time to get our food. You have to order on a tablet. When we tried to order more stuff the tablet didn't work properly and almost ordered everything that was on the menu ! Not easy to have the waitress understand. She didn't seem to speak much English. We won't go back..."}
{"text":"Excellent kitchen selection and quality. Finally a trustworthy AYCE sushi joint on the Danforth after Katsu changed owners years ago."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE Japanese restaurants on the Danforth.  I had a great experience dining at lunch.   This restaurant is spacious and very clean.  They did a good job renovating.    They have good customer service and their food comes fairly quick.  You order food with an iPad. They offer a variety of items including various soup selections, dim sum items, appetizers, sushi pieces, rolls, handrolls, fried items, grilled items, noodles, rice dishes and desserts.  Sometimes I find that AYCE places stuff your sushi with rice to fill you up faster, however, 8 sushi isn't like that, the sushi rolls comes with adequate amount of rice.  The cake taste mediocre, great selection of ice cream flavours.   They currently have a special - save 10% with AYCE and 15% for take out if you pay with cash.  Also, 50% off AYCE on your birthday."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh sushi, a lot of variety on the AYCE menu, clean and nice ambiance, friendly staff, quick service and at a good price! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"BEST SUSHI JOINT!  Decor is calming and the place is clean. I have been coming here for over a year, it's a nice local restaurant. It's AYCE (All You Can Eat) and ordered on iPads, the servers are attentive and accommodating. Food is served fast, and they never forget to refill pops, hot tea."}
{"text":"Sushi 8 is grrr-8 (sorry, but it was just asking for it)!   We came in for AYCE dinner last night. Between the two of us, we've probably tried all of the sushi buffets on the Danforth, and this one can be solidly recommended. It's the only one that has an iPad ordering system, and definitely has the most extensive menu. The resto is a little too large to be cozy, but it also means that there's plenty of seating and even a private room for events. Service was kind and timely; our smiley waitress was really good about coming by with hot tea.   I was pleasantly surprised by a lot of the non-sushi items. They usually tend to be hit or miss at a lot of AYCEs, and a bit of a risky click when you're nearing full capacity. But the takoyaki was yummy, and so were the beef enoki rolls. Chicken teriyaki also tasted noticeably better than at other places along the Danforth. The sushi itself was fresh and the emphasis is on the ingredients versus huge hunks of rice. Sushi 8 also has the best dessert selection, with four flavours of ice cream, a bunch of cakes, and then some nice nonstandard things like crème brulé and fried milk. I didn't think the crème brulé would be good, but it was, and I wanted the fried milk to be good so badly, but it wasn't. The latter was not, however, dressed with mayo (LOL) like another reviewer said it would be. I'm not sure if I was happy or disappointed I didn't receive such a bizarre combo. Anyways, coming back for sure, if not for elusive mayo desserts then because we live in the area and are sashimi binge enthusiasts."}
{"text":"Arrived before the dinner rush and was glad to be seated and eating, cause the restaurant filled up fast! We ordered a variety of dishes to try. Some of our favourites included garden and mango salads, miso soup, enoki beef, bbq short ribs, cheese wonton, thai curry, tobiko, salmon rose, spicy salmon, unagi, rainbow, yam and avocado and other rolls from the dinner menu. The rolls are cut into small pieces of eight. Would be nice if they offered 4-6 pieces a roll instead, in order to sample more kinds. Creme brulee was delicious too!  Service is quick, staff are friendly and the dining area and washrooms are clean. For the Danforth, this restaurant stands out (especially that it's new) and serves up good food for under $25. Hopefully they maintain their standard."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this restaurant after reading reviews of sushi places in the surrounding area. So when I finally had the time yesterday my boyfriend took me there.   So we walked in and there was maybe three tables with people in it, so I was slightly skeptical since is was dinner time and I expected it to be busy. We chose to go with the AYCE (Ipad). This place has no liquor license just as a heads up, so tea, water or soft drink beverages only.  The sashimi was fantistic, that is pretty much where it ended. Everything else either lacked flavour or just wasn't for me. The rolls were not consistent in size and some of the things we ordered never came.  The main factor for me was the service. The gentleman who sat us was pleasant and so was the female who was serving. However there was a guy with a hat that just was rude. Customer service is a main factor for me and this guy ruined it for me.   Most likely never coming back."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 stars/5. The food was very delicious and there was not a dish where it was below expectations. The sushi and the hand rolls were all in small portions as you could order more than one type without having to worry about not finishing it. The food came out very fast and there was no wait time.   The service was very good as the waiters were very friendly and nice. The atmosphere was dark and the interior was clean and nicely decorated.   This all you can eat sushi in the middle of Greek Town in Toronto is delicious and tasteful. Not to mention the prices was awesome as lunch was only $14.99! I would revisit if I was in the area but it is just a regular all you can eat sushi buffet."}
{"text":"There's nothing special about this AYCE Japanese restaurant. It's mediocre, middle of the road type venue. Sure, you can stuff your face for $24, but is it worth it? I'm not so sure. The food alright, but calamari disappointed me. Black dragon roll had tiny pieces of unagi on top. It's little things like that, coupled with the overall mediocre quality of food what disappointed me. For me, one visit was enough. I don't see myself going back there again."}
{"text":"I've ordered 8 Sushi from Uber Eats atleast twice . Definitely my choice for sushi around Leslieville atleast for delivery! California roll was amazing and dynamite roll. The spicy salmon could be more spicy maybe add more spicy mayo? Always packed nicely and tastes great!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with a friend recently and it was pretty good. Just a heads up, the bento boxes on the lunch menu increased their price to 9.95 from 7.95. I found the food much better than other sushi places on the Danforth. The salad in my bento box was amazing, also the sushi and the dumplings were very yummy! The miso soup was a bit bland, though. The beef teriyaki I ordered were a bit tough but not too bad.  I like the atmosphere, it's pretty quiet and a lot of space in the middle. The service was also very quick and thorough. I probably wouldn't go here again for the bento boxes since it's a bit high compared to other sushi places along the Danforth, but I will definitely check out their AYCE sushi one day! They have these iPads that you can use to order. Must be convenient and more organized (i.e not missing orders)."}
{"text":"Came by around 10pm Fri Apr 28 with my husband. This is our second time here. Received the fried items first. Ordered sushi rolls that came in a platter all at once 40mins later. Was told it was last call so we ordered pad thai and a few items along with desserts. Was served desserts first. The waitress came with the pad thai after. We explained that we're done eating. She was so pissed off and disappointed. She went around the restaurant with our food talking to other staff. Another waitress came by with the food (now cold) and told us that we'll be charged for any uneaten food. I understand the value and principal in wasting food, however...  Tips: When it's last call, have some common sense and serve hot items first then dessert. It's restaurant etiquette across the board. Once dessert is served, eating is over.  Tips: Advise your staff to check their attitude at the door. We didn't come out on a Friday night for this shit service.  Tips: It's not worth to charge a customer a few dollars for a small serving of pad thai and end up losing customers for life.  Should've gone to Yokohama in Markham."}
{"text":"Ordered 8 Sushi on UberEATS and it's the best Japanese food I have had in a LONG time. Portion sizes are huge, food is delicious, vegetables are fresh. Dynamite roll was our fave."}
{"text":"Love this place convenient and delicious. I live nearby and this is the only Asian place close by but, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent and so was the lunch AYCE price $16.99 we started off with sashimi which was really good and properly portioned pieces but it took at least 10-15 mins for our first order, after we got our small orders salmon belly,fish,calamari etc we then got our platter of sushi rolls we ordered when we were almost finished one of the rolls had a HAIR in it which was disgusting so I told the waitress and pointed it out as to not embarrass the employees there she then apologizes and we ask for our bill when we got our change back one of the waiters brings us a fried squid tentacle at the end when we finished eating already!!   Bad service  Lack of hygiene  Food was good"}
{"text":"Went with hopes of finding my new local AYCE. This place had mixed reviews but the most recent ones looked okay; sadly disappointed with my trip.  I don't enjoy leaving bad reviews and would like to preface that I am not exactly a sushi consoeur, nor even a picky eater for that matter, but I found this place completely inedible; I actually felt like I was going to throw up after the first course.  This restaurant needs to rethink where they are buying their ingredients.   Salmon in hand rolls was mostly fatty connective tissue and slimy. Immediately turned my stomach, so tried ordering some cooked food instead. Calamari looked like the overcooked onion ring you get sometimes from fast food places mixed in with your fries, shrimp tempura was a cocktail ring sized shrimp in an undercooked chicken finger sized lump of breading that was beyond greasy.   I want to blame oil not being hot enough during cooking, but then how did my burnt calamari happen?  We ate 'All we could stomach' after about 10 minutes, asked for the bill then went to A&W for a burger.   Location and server were nice and still tipped because it wasn't his fault, but biggest waste of money I have spent in a while.   Don't waste yours, give 8 Sushi a pass until Chef Ramsay can come give them a hand."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night. We tried the deep fried squid and I'm not normally a fan of anything deep-fried , as well we tried the grilled octopus in teriyaki sauce both of which were incredible but by far my favorite was the Teriyaki octopus  At some point we realized those two dishes would have been enough with green tea but we'd also ordered a sushi diamond and a sushi silver and we struggled to finish it in fact we ended up taking a few pieces home packed on ice.  The service was incredible and the food was phenomenal it was a little loud and open and we thought what was missing may have been a sushi bar with a bench so you could watch your food being prepared but all in all it was amazing"}
