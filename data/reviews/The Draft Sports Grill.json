{"text":"I know that the bar tender noticed that I wasn't eating my food. That was because it was gross. You can put all the spices in the world on crappy cheese, it's not going to make it better Mac and Cheese. I might have eaten 7 bites before I asked for my bill. She didn't ask me if there was a problem, she also didn't ask me if I wanted a box. That tells me that she noticed something was up. I still tipped, not very well but I did. I won't be back and I do not recommend it based not only on the food, but the service. I honestly feel as though she could have cared less. And also they played Creed, stay away if at all possible!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new place in our neck of the woods. We went on a Thursday night and there were more servers than patrons at the time. 
I heard they had Chicken and Waffles and thought I would give it a try. It is usually one of my favorite dishes. The waffle was semi warm on the outside but cold on the inside. I asked the waitress if they were homemade. At $13 for the plate I was sure hoping she would say yes. She said yes  but I couldn't figure out how a freshly cooked waffle could be cold on the inside. She brought me a new one. I managed to get a quarter of it down along with one chicken tender. For a $13  dish, I was not impressed. I could heat up an Eggo waffle and some chicken strips for less than $3 at home and save pocket the extra $10. 
Not sure I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great spot to catch a game.  Wait staff was attentive and the food is pretty good.  It's nothing spectacular but it's a solid notch above typical greasy bar fare.  I'll be back to watch any out of market game while I'm in the area."}
{"text":"While back in town for the long weekend we decided to come in on Thursday for dinner and drinks. Being our first time there, it looked very promising. The televisions are amazing, they are everywhere!
We ordered burgers, which were good and mac n cheese but I dont know..was that mac n cheese?? My god, It tasted like yellow pieces of rubber. 
It was pretty bad.
 How do you mess up mac n cheese??
There were two bartenders serving us. 
A blonde and a brunette. The brunette, she told us her name was Big Al, was great. Great personality and service.
The blonde, however, we found devoid of personality and She didn't even bother to introduce herself. 
 My wife said she was as BLAND as the mac n cheese. 
Not a good thing if you want repeat customers.

We are conflicted on how to rate our visit. 
To Big Al and the TV'S we give 5 stars but the blonde and the mac n cheese 3 stars.

We wouldn't say avoid The Draft altogether, but we would recommend asking for Big Al and not ordering the mac n cheese."}
{"text":"Service is SLOW, food ok, wings are great. Server walks around doing what not sure and food took longer then expected, not because they were busy."}
{"text":"Great local sports bar. Very high quality food compared to most sports bar environments, and a large beer selection, with a keg tracker displaying them all. It takes two pages to fit all the draft beers on tap. Good drink specials and ESPECIALLY great happy hour. Lasts from 3-7. and great deals. Not going to find much better food in a sports bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good daily specials, wings are pretty bomb, great beer selection and lots of TVs. Servers and bartenders all do a solid job!"}
{"text":"If I could give a negative I would. Walked In to grab a quick bite, hostess was nice and some other chick sitting off to the side says its a 10$ cover each person because they are showing some UFC fight that wasn't even a big event... It's before 8pm and the place was empty. So you mean to tell me, your place is empty and turning away people that want to spend money on food and drink and NOT watch UFC is the way to go... Sounds like a good business practice for a NEW sports bar to me. NOT! Stop being so cheap and charging $10 cover to pay your pay per view fee and worry about bringing in customers to make you money."}
{"text":"So UFC 209  fight night had a little change up from BWW  no problem with a unexpected  $5.00 cover , they do have A lot of big screen tv's so that's awesome, sat down order took 22 min   had a order of hot wings (10)  one shot of of ranch, nachos needed more meat and toppings left with a pile of tortilla   IT'S A BAR  SOLID 3"}
{"text":"Nice selection of craft beers (some local to AZ) with good happy hour specials on domestics. I enjoy mixing black & tans from good craft beers and was pleased to hear from my server that this would be no problem. I found Victory at Sea's Vanilla & Coffee Porter (10%) mixed well with College Street's Big Blue Van Blueberry (5.8%). A creamy blueberry coffee flavor was the result. Delicious. 

I was there on a Tuesday night for a Coyotes Hockey game and was pleasantly surprised to find three other Hockey games playing on their MANY televisions. This night also offered trivia and while I didn't particularly care for the constant talking of the host via a microphone, he wasn't too distracting or overpowering. And it only lasted a few hours between 7-9pm. 

We also ordered a basket of fries with a cajun dry rub. They were served piping hot and were delicious!"}
{"text":"Very nice bar,from the decoration to the staff. I don't know if it gets really busy because i went on a Sunday night when they first open, but the bartender was great. Defenely coming back."}
{"text":"This is our first time here (me, my wife, and our 4 year old). Great, comfortable setup with TONS of TVs. Really solid beer list and bigger menu than you might expect from a sports bar.  Server was friendly, attentive, and helpful with menu selections (and she was really sweet to our little girl). 

We ordered the boneless wings (1/2 honey hot and 1/2 sea salt) and a half order of the chicken nachos. Wings were really good ... and nachos were exceptional. The nachos are HUGE (warning - only order the full plate if you're bringing an army to help you), but you don't sacrifice any quality for the quantity. Loved the banana peppers and you get a lot of really good guacamole too. 

Very impressed with everything here ... we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Overall good.  

Good fries

Cold Beer

Good TV coverage

Not impressed with grilled cheese...stay away"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times, and I have to say I love it!

The food is great,and the drink specials are always nice. It's a great place to come and enjoy some football."}
{"text":"I am not sure what all the negative reviews are! This place was great! They have really good specials everyday to! The nachos were great BUT get the half size the full size is HUGE! They have 22oz beers almost everyday for 4 dollars! What a steal! I love this place and will be back again! I hope everyone that complained goes in and tries it again!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  I enjoyed the gourmet slant to the menu.  Had a hard time choosing, but ended up having the chicken ciabatta sandwich with a side salad instead of fries.  Waitress didn't mention the upcharge for the subsitution, which is a pet peave of mine, hence the missing star.  My husband had a burger with maple bacon, which he thoroughly enjoyed.  We went for a weekday lunch and liked the open atmosphere.  I think it would be a fun place to go for happy hour.  We enjoyed the screens all around the room, too.  Just bought 2 more Groupons so we can take the family next time!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today. I had the Cajun Bleu burger (I think that's what is was called) along with sweet potato fries. Both were delicious! The meat on the burger was awesome! The service was good. Seemed like a clean place. The drinks I had were good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food was delishous and LISA was an absolute peach. She was sure to get us whatever we needed right away and super friendly.  Great Happy hour deals everyday also. Will go back soon for sure."}
{"text":"Lots of big TVs. The burgers are pretty good but overall I was unimpressed. Our waitress barely slowed long enough to take our order and the wings were dry and tasted burned. I won't be returning anytime soon. Not the worst."}
{"text":"I loved this places food and atmosphere. The wings were really yummy. Great selection of beer and inviting for having a little one with us, they gave us a little bib for the baby and sat us where we could have a high chair. Bathrooms were really clean and had a clean changing table too! All the food came our fresh and hot and our waitress was very helpful. Great hang out spot!"}
{"text":"First time in. Very nice place. Set back off the road so u need to tell ur friends. Great selection of beer. Most places have 100 beers on tap but ppl only order like 15 kinds. This place has those kind. Best of the best. 
Tv situation is insane. Probably the best I have seen. Been to other chain bars. They are ok. This place blows them out of the water. Best for any game or a random day. 
If ur hung over, this is the place to be. Best Bloody Mary I've had. Food is perfect to sober up for 5 min with then start drinking all day again. 
I also had the valley of death bowl of chili cheese fries. Very good. Nacho plate is gigantic. U can split a half plate. 
New place so everything being ironed out, but is always improving. Chain places don't care or listen to u bc they don't have to. This place does and makes it better. Enjoy. Going to make this a regular place for me and my fiancé."}
{"text":"I found this place the other day, Craig, the bartender is awesome. The happy hour 2-7 rocks and I'm here again. It's a hidden gem. The Lemon salt chicken wings are bomb. (I ate some of my boys' so I'm not sure if that's what they are called btw)  TV's galore too. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Had the Alamo with Cajun rubbed fries. It was really good. The bartender, some dude with a beard, was on top of his game and really accommodating. 

Don't let the dimmed windows detract you from coming in, it was definitely worth it"}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite local spots, for many reasons. As a person who likes good service, good food prepared promptly and properly, sports, and of course an occasional beer, this place has all of that, and more!

Don't let the outside fool you - inside the restaurant is very spacious with numerous seating options, including a lengthy bar, plenty of high-top tables on the bar side, as well as numerous dining tables on the other side. But regardless of where you choose to sit, there are a plethora of big screen TV's to allow you to enjoy your favorite game while you dine. 

needless to say, with a name like \"The Draft\", the beer selection on tap will most assuredly offer something that will quinch your thirst. And when it comes to food, the menu is anything but basic pub fare. In addition to burgers and sandwiches,  there is actually a good variety of food options, including healthy options for those who are diet conscious (like me). I especially like \"The Fitz\" as a healthy option - grilled chicken, rice, and steamed veggies - yum! 

So whether you are looking for a meal, a drink, a casual venue to watch live sports, or a combination of all if the above, I recommend you give \"The Draft\" a try. Oh yeah, I almost forgot, they also have an outdoor patio on the side of the building for those who prefer to sit outside. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here when they first opened and was impressed. Boy have things gone down hill. For their signature burger it was very bland and super greasy. Like, puddles of grease on the plate. Pizza cookie was basically raw and a waste of $7. But the most annoying part was the wait staff. Why have 3 waitresses standing around ignoring customers only to make the busy bartender take all the orders and run all food."}
{"text":"Awesome, friendly service and the dill pickle wings are amazing. Great beer and lots of space. They have a lot of TVs and they show UFC fights! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our first time there we were not sure what sure what to expect but were pleasantly surprised by the good vibes. TVs and big screens surround you so its the perfect atmosphere to catch you favorite game. It was packed but we didn't have to wait for a seat. Food comes out quick and is delicious. The half order of nachos is enough for four people to snack on before dinner. The fried pickles were on point. Pretty good draft and bottle beer selection. They do a weekly jersey raffle on Mondays and give you tickets for it the week prior just for eating there. Servers were very nice and attentive. I even checked in on Facebook and their Facebook page liked it!! They obviously care about customers!"}
{"text":"Solid beer selection. Pretty good wings. Real good service. Went for a fight night and had a fun time. Sometimes it's hard to get a drink at bar during a fight but our girl was really awesome. 

It's not a real fancy bar and it's not a dive bar. It's right in the middle which is a good spot to be for a happy hour. 
On that note remember it's right by a police station so make sure you call an uber if you've had too much."}
{"text":"I come to Mesa for business about every month or so and have a favorite restaurant near my hotel I frequent. I had been hoping they would put in a sports bar in this area and was very happy when driving by- I discovered they did.
I sat in the bar area and the TV set up was quite impressive even by sports bar standards! The draft beer menu was just average coming from a huge craft beer (IPA) fan. They really should do more to keep up with many of the other establishments that understand the importance of the craft brew trend.

Having steak two nights in a row at the other place I go, I opted for something healthier (I know at a sports bar, your are thinking WTF?). But they had a Greek salad that looked good. Well... It was certainly not a full meal especially if you are hungry and I am not a fan or arugula which was the greens they used (they really should have gone with spinach but this IS a sports bar- if not a more \"creative\" one in terms of food). The homemade dressing they used was also ok but not something to write home about. So I had the Greek wrap. OK, duh... I should have know that would be the Greek salad in a tortilla but it was the only other thing that looked remotely healthy- not including the fries. Again not bad but I know I really should have planned for my dietary transgressions to take place tonight instead and have one of the burgers that look good on the menu anyway! Probably wouldn't have been that much more in the way of calories considering the amount of \"healthy\" food I had.

Also, I was not initially very impressed with the service. I had a waitress and what I believe was a trainee greet me initially and take care of my beer order but I feel I was forgotten and had to waive one of them down a couple times after that. I did mention that I felt forgotten about and the service did improve thereafter. But there was only 7-8 tables full on this Wednesday night and not that much of a workload on the servers as I could see. Towards the end it did get much better and they were certainly always nice.

All in all, I still had an pretty enjoyable experience here as I type this (I am really supposed to be catching up on work while I eat and drink) Since this establishment is still quite new, I chalk most of it up to \"growing pains\" I plan on coming back next time I am in town and do expect this to be a regular stop for me once they iron out some of the kinks! And I am looking forward to trying on of those burgers next time!"}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and made to order. A step above other sports bars! Wait staff is hospitality founded. Great place with a wide draft choice for hubby and 28 big screens for sports.  AND I'm watching women's softball on 4 of them. We'll done people!"}
{"text":"Guy with  Beard working on 2/27/18 rude asshole. Bad service. Not friendly. Will not come back."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here with my family. We would come at least 2 or 3 times a week or every other week. Anyway, this is the 3rd time that I asked for extra crispy wings and, they used the exact same wing just cooked it over again. which made my wing extra dry and hard. At the end of our meal, we received our check and my husband noticed there was an 18 percent gratuity added to the bill. on the menu it does state an 18 percent gratuity would be added to parties of 8 or more. we only had 5 people 3 adults and 2 babies. We questioned why the 18 percent was added on when we didn't have 8 or more people. Our waiter (Jay) stated he was  protecting his self and the bartender because the past couple times we were in there we didn't tip. (we always tip). So he our waiter took it upon his self to add 18 percent to our bill without our knowledge. we usually tip based off service and I'm sorry but, if service is bad then don't expect me to tip for messing up my orders or being rude. We will NEVER come back to this so called place of business ever again."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in and try this new restaurant near work.  I am glad I did as it had one of the best burgers I have had in a while.  It was cooked just right and had amazingly grilled mushrooms on top of that.  The maple bacon was great addition to the burger.  The burger itself was huge.  They call it the draft burger and it has onion tomato, maple bacon, cheese, and mushrooms.  I added a pretzel bun to top it off.  the staff recommended and it was a great choice. I tried their bbq sauce with my fries and it is definitely one of the best bbq sauces in the area.  it is a little thicker sauce but it is top notch.  I can't wait to come back and try more.  I don't review often last time I reviewed it was for Ikes sandwiches which is next to the restaurant.  I am glad to see this area that didn't have match for a while get some of the best new spots the valley has to offer.  Definitely have to come again as soon as possible.  the sauces are amazing."}
{"text":"Food sucked, burger ordered medium came out super well, but fries were still raw. Service sucks so does all the customers next me to me at the tiny bar. Thanks for leading me astray Yelp. I wanted a decent meal not the Mesa Swap Meet."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for craft brews and good American style food. They serve your typical bar stuff, but their entrees  are pretty delicious and priced affordably.

My experience with the servers has always been great and if you need recommendations, they know their stuff. 

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Fast response to a mass text that was not directly from them. Very respectful."}
{"text":"I did a quick lunch here a couple weeks ago.   Very nice staff and, while I wasn't drinking, it had a large selection of beers.  The appetizers (calamari and poppers) I ordered came out quickly and were very good."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a tip from a friend and it was great. It happened to be Wednesday all happy hour and all domestic drafts in the 22 oz mug are $3 and that's not just Bud light and Coors light. Four Peaks, Grand Canyon, on and on. I got the flank steak with salad instead of fries and it was perfect. I'm not a big veggie guy but  the steamed veggies were crisp, the salad was just right and the shrimp I added on were just right and not greasy at all. It's hard to find if you don't know where you're going but it's the former Buffalo Wild Things behind the big blue building at Southern and Alma School. Don't let \"sports bar\" fool you this place is top shelf."}
{"text":"Love, love,love, this place! Finally something fun to do that's close to home. This area needed a place like the Draft! Nachos were huge and so tasty, service was excellent, and the atmosphere is awesome. Great place for happy hour. They have TV's all over the place and shuffleboard too. Love it!"}
{"text":"Amazing FOOD! even better beer selection for all types of drinkers and if you want to watch a sports game, it's ON! We will be back! Kids and all! There is also a growler fill station so you can take your favorite beer home!"}
{"text":"This place is very impressive,    The number of high Def Flat Screens and Projectors is outstanding.   The picture quality on most of the large Flat Screens is some of the best High Definition I have seen.   The Beer Selection both on Tap and in Bottles is superb.   Some of the best selections I have seen.  The place has that new and shiny feel about it,  the restrooms are clean and new looking, and done very well.
This place is flat out one of the nicest I have been in,  and I've been in a few.
The  bartenders and employees will look familiar to some people as they are a well put together team that come from other places and are very friendly and accommodating..  This was my wife and my self's  first visit and we plan on more.   The wings along with the calamari  we had this visit was very good.  Many choices of wing sauces also.  
The lighting is subdued so the atmosphere is great.
 I wish The Draft Sports Grill much success and see you again."}
{"text":"I've visited the Draft about five different times and have not been disappointed. They have a great food menu with fantastic wings (draft flavor is awesome!). Their beer selection is on point for domestic and craft enthusiasts alike. Joshua - one of the owners - is a great host that likes to make sure your enjoyment expectations are well met. Finally, to top everything off, they have an abundance of great TVs and projectors, making it possible to watch sports from any seat in the restaurant/bar.

Basically if your looking for a great sports bar this is it hands down."}
{"text":"Like a previous reviewer, we also showed up at the Draft Sports bar & Grill after working at the Feed My Starving Children charity workshop. To the point, the craft beer selection was excellent (especially for a neighborhood bar, unfortunately for us , we live in Ahwatukee). The bar food menu was standard, but the food very well executed. Having read other reviews in advance of our visit, it seemed that \"service\" was either the motivation for an excellent review or alternatively, the cause of not such a good experience for some. Simply and to the point for the benefit of management, we were served by a young lady named Jordan, and I would venture to say that if everybody were to have our experience, then all reviewers would be concurring with my 5 stars. Thanks Jordan, for a job well done!"}
{"text":"I've been here on 3 separate occasions. The 1st was okay... the server was friendly. They didn't have the beer I ordered the 1st couple times but she was fairly nice about it.  The nachos... not dressed at all. Pretty dry,  but again , service was decent. I went bqck for a 2nd time for just drinks and the one guy who helped me was VERY nice. Asked if we liked our selections, was very attentive, good experience overall. 3rd time, I was at the bar the whole time. I decided to go to the bar thinking I'd get faster service from the 2nd time around. Nope! Unless you're a regular, you may not get the service you want. I don't have high expectations, but by the time I waited for beers as well as my check to be ringed up (for the amount of people there) was ridiculous. I understand that the 1st 2 times were not fantastic, but don't really want to give it another shot after that 3rd. The bar tender clearly passed us over several times."}
{"text":"the food and Kelly are equally amazing!!! food is super fresh and local. and the service is bar none I've the top"}
{"text":"REALLY poor service. The food was ok but nothing great. Music was far too loud - and bad pop music - for dining and trying to talk to the other people in your party. Not coming back here again."}
{"text":"Random stop as I was looking for a change of scenery. The TV setup might be the best ever for a sports bar and this place will be packed for football season I would assume. On the night I went, it was just a few old men at the bar, but the bartender was nice and just enjoyed the baseball game while sipping on some cheap happy hour drafts. Did not try the food which based on reviews and food coming out of kitchen may have been a good choice. As I was sitting in the front talking on phone also noticed a large army of ants were actually in the place right in that front area, so I was not eating food that night no matter what was on the menu. Anyway, looks like this place could host me for a week or two during the fall, but the smallish bar area might be the downfall when it gets packed."}
{"text":"First time here.  The burgers were awesome!!!   Lots of TVs which allow easy viewing from any table.   Server was very attentive.  Even though it was not very crowded we had a bit of a wait for our food.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"First time I visited this place. I was immediately seated and greeted by my server probably took my drink order. Thank you Sadie for phenomenal service, we had a great time and thank you for putting up with us. The menu had a good variety of selections but simple enough to where it was not overwhelming. And the food was great too."}
{"text":"AZ Springrolls are fantastic and they have a great friendly staff. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great crab and artichoke dip. Makenna was super nice and talkative at the bar.  Had  some SWEET chili wings that where awesome.  We will be back soon."}
{"text":"At the last minute we needed to find a place to watch the duel in the desert. They were able to accommodate a party of 11. The service was great and the food was excellent as well. Nice beer selection."}
{"text":"Go Lemon Pepper on the wings and the Draft Sauce won't disappoint. I'm a tough wing critic and I can say these are some of the best around!"}
{"text":"Beers are decent. Servers are meh. Sometimes the places is so packed they'll forget about you. Not a terrible place to come watch a game though."}
{"text":"I haven't dined-in here yet, but I work near by and have ordered lunch here a few times. It does look great inside: new, clean, great screen set up too. Staff is friendly! Food is a bit of a deviation from regular sports bar fare which earns them major brownie points. The menu is a pretty good size with great variation. I was even surprised to see crab mac and cheese, which I rarely ever see in the valley, it's next on my list to try. Food is always ready fast, prices are awesome, food is delicious and we never have issues or discrepancies on our large lunch orders. The Draft is off to a great start!"}
{"text":"Was here a few weeks ago. Pretty much sat there all day watching football playoffs. My friends and I ordered almost every appetizer on the menu. Comfortable environment. Great food. Clean. Really nice place. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"I feaking love this place! 

So we have been here 4 times now, and i swear its always happy hour! Today, Wednesday is happy hour all day, on Thursdays its 241 drinks all day. I have no idea why there arent more people here! 

This place is cute as can be, for a sports bar. .
And the patio allows smoking, which is good for me ..

Ther are literally 20 tvs here..

Ps ive had burgers, tacos, mac and cheese,  all good. And my service has been on point each visit.

Check it out peeps!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i come here a few times a month! Good for sports fans, there are tvs everywhere! Not a huge fan of many food items but the patty melt is awesome, the chicken strips also and they have the BEST fried pickles EVER! Awesome brew selection and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the environment.  I didn't eat there but the bar selection was good in that craft beer was on tap.  I will definitely go again and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Very surprised they have great veggie options! Very friendly service, good eats and a nice beer list make this a good place to watch the fights."}
{"text":"Have been there twice this week for lunch and a handful of times in the past. The food has gotten better each time I come back. My Server was spot on today; super friendly and very good service. I had a burger with guacamole & pico de gallo and sweet potato fries. They were delicious. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We came for a late Sunday lunch just wanting burgers. Tiffany took care of us, she was quick to get us drinks and take our order. Both burgers were i tended to be medium, but were med well. Seasoning with a Lil more salt & pepper would have been good too, a lil bland. Toppings flavors, sauces, fries, and onion rings were OUTTA THIS WORLD. Not too salty, crisp was just right, definitely fresh. One burger was a Lil greasy, but manager remedied the problem quickly.  We'll DEFINITELY return."}
{"text":"The employees are great and it's a good place to watch a game. It's clean and there are plenty of TVs. The beer selection is decent and the prices are reasonable. The low rating is for the food. I got Arizona rolls and soup and they were both inedible. Also, the place was dead. Nobody there for the Territorial cup game? It's the game of the season and there were maybe 30 people in the place?"}
{"text":"Get the wings. Seriously. Some of the best I've had. Great staff. Two dozen beers. Accessible. 

Brand new bar, with brand-new bar with tons with tons of big-screen TVs."}
{"text":"I came here looking for a place to watch some football and drink beer but this place was charging $5 cover to enter. I can't say I will ever be back since I feel it's a waste of my time to drive out to this place and then pay just to get in."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Drafts and both have been  great experiences.  

They really did a nice job updating the inside.  There are a ton if TVs with various sports on all around the room. I really like that no matter where you sit you can still get a good view of the games.

The staff is super nice and very helpful. The manager has been very friendly and made some good recommendations. 

We've had an array of appetizers and I recommend the nachos,  the pretzels and the dill wings! They have a good choice of beers to select from as well. Great place to watch a game or hang out after work for a drink."}
{"text":"We watched the Floyd & Conor fight here, all the staff were nice most especially the manager. The food was great! All in all the experience was great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after getting tattoo'd for a drink or two and some dinner with the wife, A beer rep came to our table as we sat down and offered to buy us our first beer that he was promoting. SCORE! (i forget what beer) It was Taco Tuesday so we had chicken, carne asada and the fish tacos. The only good ones were the fish, tons of flavor, the other 2 were...ehh.
We also had the egg roll appetizer, which was actually pretty good.  I wish this place was closer to my house, I'd be here ALL THE TIME. I really like this place, very clean and cool looking. Im a FAN!!"}
{"text":"I had set up a group event for Saturday afternoon at The Draft in Mesa.  The issue with my group is that even though 25-40 people RSVP that they're going, sometimes only 5 people will show.

I arrived at The Draft about an hour early for my group (without reservations) and they were able to accommodate me.  I had my option (at 1pm on a Saturday it was surprisingly not busy) of being inside or out on the patio.  I chose the patio since I wasn't sure if we had smokers in our group.  I asked about being able to watch hockey on one of the many TV's they have in the establishment, and again, they accommodated me right away.  As my group arrived slowly and one by one (a total of 19 people showed), the one waitress we had was amazing.  I wish I had gotten her name so I could give her props.  She was constantly coming outside to check on us, refill our drinks, and check for new group members.

I ended up eating the Butterfly Shrimp, with a Basket of fries and for dessert, their chocolate pizza cookie.  The butterfly shrimp was amazing, and was served hot; the fries were homemade and seasoned wonderfully.  The chocolate pizza cookie was out of this world!  Now one of my group members had the brownie dessert, and that looked amazing as well, so I'll be trying that the next time I'm there.  Along with my Ice tea (which in my opinion was great tasting without any sugar added) my bill was $23.  Not bad in my opinion for the amount of food I received.  My group members were all happy with their food, their service, and the prices.  The only reason there is one star missing from this review is that The Draft didn't have enough pitchers to just put out water and ice tea pitchers on the tables.  NOW in their defense, lol, the glasses you get your drinks in are, I believe, 32 oz.  But with it being a little warm that day, and out on the patio, being able to refill our own drinks would have been nice.

I'm definitely going to have my group meet here on a regular basis.  I want to try just about everything on the menu, as it all just looks heavenly."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm still waiting for the bill. I've had to go out of my way everytime I needed something. Food is average, service is poor. I like the big TVs and open areas but the service killed it for me. I'll come back here again In hopes of better service."}
{"text":"Good place, good service, good food.  Lots of TV's for the sports fans. Not cheap but not crazy expensive either"}
{"text":"The beer selection here is pretty great and their mimosa flight is awesome! My husband and I came for brunch initially and were concerned when we saw that it wasn't busy at all (not a good sign) but the food, drinks and service were great! We came again after work one day and the place was super packed! I guess brunch isn't really big here when it isn't football season. My favorite this about this place is that we got the same bartender/server each time and she is really awesome! I always ask for recommendations on what to order and she asked qualifying questions before making a suggestion based on her own personal tastes or suggesting the most expensive item llke some servers do. The food here has always been pretty solid. It's a great place to watch a game!"}
{"text":"Great food. Been here several times and have always had great food and great sercice! Definitely will return. If you like beer this is the place to go...they have more beers than one could ever hope for."}
{"text":"Groupon led us here, and glad we did. Off the beat and path but sure worth it. All new interior, LOVE the bar and TV set up, as well as the on-screen beer selection, including price and just how much is left in their kegs. We ordered a couple appetizers and were very good, so looking forward to trying their menu.  Seems like a decent HH.

Oh ya, my gal said the bathrooms were really, really clean, so I guess thats another plus!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, not your typical sports bar food.  Fresh food that taste solid.  Surrounded by TV's with any game that you need to watch will be on. The feel is clean and fresh not like most sport bars.  I would highly recommend you try 
The Draft you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place used to be a Buffalo Wild Wings, and I gotta say, I like The Draft better.  I was impressed with their selection of draft beer, the TVs were big and well placed, and I think they have a much better menu than B-Dubs.  I got the fried shrimp appetizer with fries, and it was excellent.  The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is because of the prices, ie value.  The beers are pretty expensive compared to other similar sports bars, as well as the other menu items.  

As a side note, I went there with a friend to watch the Broncos game, and the Cardinals game happened to playing at the same time.  If I ever go back to The Draft, I will definitely avoid it during a Cardinals game.  That's no reflection on the restaurant itself, but it was obnoxious in there."}
{"text":"The food is awesome & the bartenders and servers always take care of us. They're great with getting our games up. We used to be Native regulars and proudly make the Draft our new home."}
{"text":"Good food great service. The food isn't award winning but it's better than most bar food. So I usually just get the pretzels and cheese. Servers are always friendly and accurate. Not always super quick but quick enough you can't complain."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed every visit here. Wait staff at our table or the bar has been professional and attentive. The food is quality and delicious. Portions are ample! CRAIG behind the bar keeps glasses filled and makes excellent recommendations and conversation. ALEXANDRA makes sure her tables are happy and well-fed. We love coming here for games or fights on tv. People are your best asset, take great care of them!!"}
{"text":"We liked this place! Great beer selection, and a good strong martini for after a few. Food was great. Friend said they were the best fries ever, fish tacos had a good kick to them, and burger on a pretzel bun with maple bacon? Yes please! BBQ pulled pork with broccoli slaw? Hell yeah!  Lots of big tvs and they even had shuffleboard. I hope they stick around, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers! The live keg screen is neat. Bartenders are friendly, attentive, and on point. They have a wall of T.V.'s that accommodates sports fans. The wings are big and delicious. Drop in and grab a beer, this is a great joint."}
{"text":"We got delivery for this place. Really wanted it to be good but we were underwhelmed. We got chicken fingers and fish sandwhich. Our first impression is that our food was not warm. We only live 7 mins away and had to reheat our food once we were home. Chicken fingers were good. Fries had potential to be good. They were fresh cut but we felt like we got the fries that were under the light for a while. My fish sandwhich was soggy unfortunately. I will note that we discovered there was ufc fight on so maybe the reason for the okay food will try again but in person only. Hopefully I can update this review. I am rooting for the place."}
{"text":"Ok, well I started out loving this place and now kind of consider it middle of the road. Food is okay, beer prices are ridiculous. Wait staff is nice, bartender is good, but it's missing something. 

I frequent a few bars in the area and this is the one that just isn't making the cut. They were great when they first opened because it was nice to just have something new around, but the more I've been there the less I like it.

Basically it's ok, but we can do better. BTW it's not Boulders across the street \"food poisoning\". 

We have several breweries that charge less for better beer, and food in the area. If you want sports the Draft might be your place, but this guy will be watching somewhere else."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Food is good. Our server today  (Kelly) spilled a drink on our whole party , never once apologized and appeared annoyed when she had to be asked twice to get napkins so we could dry ourselves up."}
{"text":"Great sports bar. Lots of room and T.V.s for all fans of whatever sport. Amazing domestic happy hour beer prices. Put a smile on me face. Tried the boneless wings and fries with their \"Draft\" sauce. Sweet and tangy with the slightest heat. Great bartender during the day. I apologize I don't remember her name even though she introduced herself. Thats my bad!  Great mood and staff for anyone wanting to watch a good game with cold drinks!  Soon they will also have an app service for ordering and receiving libations quicker through the  app Patron. Perfect for those with minimal time. Preorder and have it ready when you get there. Genius!! Bravo The Draft"}
{"text":"I LOVE it here! Food is awesome and service has been great every time! The D Rita's are delish and happy hour is going on most of the time. The new pork topped burger was so good! We've been here a few times and try to now make it a weekly
Thing. Erika was our server tonight and she did a great job!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the service.  Alex was slow and messed up our order and didn't do the right thing to fix.  Generic atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is great! The service was stellar -- when I first got their I sat myself and the bartender came and took my drink order and gave me a menu. Shortly thereafter I was asked what I wanted. I want the ingredient of the jalapeño chicken wrap but I'm a sandwich format and they did that for me no problem. I ate my dinner and the waitress brought me my check and I was out in a speedy manner (which I appreciate). The atmosphere is fun and inviting. The bathrooms are spotless/clean. The floor plan is very open and it's nice and cold inside. I will definitely be going back when I come here again for work."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast and was welcomed in be a nice server and the music was awesome! No wait. But the Soul in a Bowl was AMAZING!!! It could feed 2 people. The 2 waffles were really good. I could only eat one and it came with bacon and real maple syrup. My mother ordered the 2 eggs and was able to get tomatoes and bacon to make it carb free. They have added some new games that the kids like. It was super clean and we are going to be back for breakfast again and again."}
{"text":"Killing time and looking for a place to have a quick drink and what a find!  This place is huge and the beer/draft selection alone is awesome.  This is a true sports bar with tons of TV's all over the place.  Just happen to be happy hour and they have awesome drink specials.  They also have a patio facing North so provides some shade and smoking for people who need to light up.  The service here was also very fast and friendly. Great location to meet friends as it's close to the freeway."}
{"text":"Came here twice while on vacation. Everything was really good- food, drinks and service. There are enough TV's that u can see sports from any seat in restaurant. Warm pretzels with beer queso were delicious, Nacho, chicken taco salad all get a thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great service, good bar food and enough TV's to find something you like.  They hooked us up with a 3 hour Pittsburgh game in the middle of Phoenix Coyote country, and kept coming back to check if we had enough beer and food.   We always did.  What's not to love?   

Great little sports bar.    Nicely done!  I shoulda bought a shirt."}
{"text":"Was in the area & wanted to wait out the traffic so we checked this place out. Nice happy hour specials with a large selection of beers. The food was good & served promptly. Overall good drinks, food, & service. Hope to get back there again & play some scuffle board."}
{"text":"That was good, I went for the chicken and waffles and I spilled the gravy! They got me more immediately, and syrup, and I finished quick. Put tapatio on the chicken if you like a sweet and spicy explosion. I also ordered the Papago brew which is local and better than shock top. The display of TVs was impressive. You look at your phone for one second and you missed 3 highlights with 3 different sports."}
{"text":"Terrible food service, got our appetizers after our entree's, but, the Manager did come by and made the appropriate changes to ensure meals were correct. Kudos to the staff for being open to criticism and understanding that what one person thinks of cooking differs from someone else's. Would definitely come back here instead of going to a \"Chain\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Stumbled into The Draft for lunch by accident & loved the place!!

Service was great and very fast, the menu selections were plentiful. The wraps a colleague and I chose were terrific!

Great beers on tap too; will definitely return  after business hours

I'm looking forward to visiting again!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we go there is great service and great prices on beer! And we definitely can't complain about the TV's! There are big screens everywhere with all of the games! And the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! I have came here a couple times and always want to go back. Good selection on the draft beers, the food is your typical bar food but upgraded. The TV's are huge and everywhere! So glad to have found this place and happy it's down the street from my house :)"}
{"text":"Food is actually really good! We got the spring rolls filled with meat for an appetizer and they were yummy! I got a burger with bacon and BBQ and it was also very good. The chicken tenders are weird looking but taste pretty good.  Service was great UNTIL we asked for our check. It took 25 mins to get our check and it was not busy. It was actually very empty for a Saturday night at 9. I'm surprised how slow it is because the food was good and the atmosphere is nice"}
{"text":"This place is great. We were in town for the week prior to the super bowl. The draft beer selection is fantastic with craft beers from California to Colorado and local brews from Arizona. The staff was great. TV screens covered the walls it was wonderful. And the food was great as well. The fries were much better than expected, the grilled chicken ciabata sandwich was not perfect but was still a great lunch... If I'm in this part of Mesa again I will come back here"}
{"text":"Visited the restaurant on a trip to Phoenix. Great service and fabulous $3 margarita specials. They're not messing around with their margaritas... 2 each and my fiancé and I were feeling nice! He loved his burger, my shrimp was ok. Nothing special but tasty enough after a few drinks. Will definitely be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"We just stopped by here and I tried the grilled chicken Baja sandwich with a side of onion rings and loved every bite! The beer list is long and not expensive at all!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on a football Sunday for lunch and we thought it was great. Plenty of TVs. The place is clean, the food was great (for sports bar food), and the service was excellent. We sat at a high top in the bar and despite how busy the place was, our server was attentive, quick and friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The service and server wet amazing and geninuely nice and great atmosphere and food was great and so were the d Rita's drinks, looking forward to going again, prices were fair for size of food portions and salads and wings we amazing."}
{"text":"The service was slow, the whole seat your self concept makes the service even slower. Took the waitress 10mins to finally ask if I wanted anything to drink. Food wasn't even worth the wait. Was there an entire hour, while I watched a group of ppl walk in, served right away, ate, paid in 30mins. 
Seriously, just because I'm one person doesn't mean you won't get a bigger tip from me vs a group of people. 
Don't waste your time...."}
{"text":"always great food and perfect sports atmosphere, great spot!"}
{"text":"Our softball team came here to eat a quick lunch but our service was so horrible.  The waitress took a few of our orders and forgot to come back to take the rest of the orders. After 15 to 20 minutes going by we had to get the waitresses attention to place the others. Once the food started to come out, the last orders came out and found out that the first orders never got place.  This wasted our 2 hr break.  We left to get something else in a rush."}
{"text":"So I took a chance based on reviews and it was pretty good.  I got the grilled Cesar salad which I wasn't a big fan as they lightly grill the Romain lettuce.  I decided to try a beer and the taste was good but the glass wasn't cold so the beer warmed up fast.  It was also strange the great ratings of this place but smack dab in the middle of lunch time and there was only maybe 4 other customers."}
{"text":"We've come here several times after participating in Feed My Starving Children since it's right across the street and it's convenient to grab a bite and a drink with our group afterwards, and I really only have good things to say about it! 

All of their food is really good, I don't think I've ever ordered something I didn't like! They always have a lot of good craft beer on tap, and often have specials for local brews (which I love). We went there last night and our server was SO great, (I wish I had kept the receipt so I could give him a shout), he went above and beyond for our table and was SO kind! 

We've been there a couple of times to watch football or hockey games as well, and it's a great place to do so, lots of TVs and they're always very nice about switching the TV to the game you want to watch! 

We will continue to frequent this place!"}
{"text":"Like Beer? Here is your spot and Quincy is at the bar to satisfy your every need. There is even an app to tell you about the beer and how much of the keg has left. 
Don't forget to get the Kennebec fries. I love wings and they are amazing. There is so much to choose from on the menu.  #inlove"}
{"text":"Update: Two more sub-par experiences, especially with the food. Chicken tenders are greasy and flavorless and small portion. Couldn't even stomach to eat all of the 5 small strips. Chicken wings don't have nearly enough sauce. Everything is overpriced. What a disappointment.


Update 4/17/15: Still very mediocre and pricey food. Happy hour is only $1 off. At this rate they're not gonna make it. 


They now have Shuffleboard and weekly team trivia is starting soon (wish they had NTN Trivia though). I still think the main issue is PRICING and FOOD...Hope they can add some more reasonable food and drink options."}
{"text":"Went in the evening, there was an important football game on and the staff seemed to have staff hands full, so the food was kinda cold. I had their signature burger and fries, they charge extra for sauce on the side. It was decent. The ambiance was upbeat and lots of beer choices. I would most definitely give it a second visit when its not packed w/ people to get a more accurate feel for the food."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at, the only thing I have to say is the service was a tad bit slow. But our girl was great for only being here by her self."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night and it was absolute madness. We had 4 different waitresses tending to us within the first 15 minutes of sitting down. They had to give us 4 free drinks because they forgot to ring them up (not so mad about that!) but it just describes the level of poor service we had. Pro tip- Order your drinks 15 minutes before you actually want them."}
{"text":"I want SO BADLY to like this place!

Let me start by saying that the place itself is beautiful. It's always very clean, they are always showing the best games (lots of basketball! :), and the servers are lovely and friendly.

However, the food leaves something to be desired. I've gone two times now, and both times I was not pleased. The first time I went, I ordered the soft pretzels with queso dip. The pretzels were ok at best, and the dip was pretty gritty and cold. The second time I ordered steak nachos. My food was lukewarm, the cheese was already dried up, and the meat had a very distinct and foul taste. 

I will more than likely return, because I really like the bar and sports coverage. I guess will just be ordering drinks."}
{"text":"Service was awesome.  Food was great.  I will definitely be back. Got the pretzel.  Beer selection is good."}
{"text":"Yeah - just ok. 

We got the wings: Insanity... which it is, I must admit, insanity how not-spicy these wings were.

Next, I had the patty melt with a couple of grey onions on white (I was told it was sourdough, but I wanted rye!).

The dragon burger was ok. It had a bit of a kick, but the onion rings, which cost $1 extra, were not good. If you're going to ingest some fried food, it should be worth it. The rings were bland and were as if they'd been baked... but they were fried, so you got the added calories without the taste; really the opposite of what's needed in these situations."}
{"text":"I went in for some UFC fights a few weeks back. This has all the elements of a good sports bar. There are TV screens everywhere. They have an excellent beer selection and their beer specials don't just consist of domestic beer like Coors or Bud Light like so many other corporate sports bars. I had the Fish and Chips and my girlfriend had the sliders both were awesome. The Fish was really good but I would have liked it to maybe come with some coleslaw or something else. We also started with the AZ eggrolls those were really good too. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is still AWSOME like the very first time I was here.Staff environment everything about this place is AWSOME!!..if I could give more than five stars here I would. Lots of beer and craft beer selections for all those craft people me I just stay with my corona/Corona Light AWSOME place and close to my house."}
{"text":"Really digging this place. The bartenders are attentive, cool, and know their stuff. In addition to this the TV's...love the TV's it's like a sports fans dream come true. Multiple TV's with a game on each. The food is of an excellent variety in addition to the beer list. The beer list is displayed on a HUGE screen over the bar and you're never left wondering over the quality of the beer. Check this place out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I come to the draft for my wings! Best wings around, never soggy always fresh and I love the honey hot. Originally I would get hot but they nailed the flavor and it is now my go to!!"}
{"text":"If you like sports bars you'll like this place! We came in last night about 8:30 PM.
From the cool decor to the countless televisions that surround the bar, there is also a pool table, shuffle board to the outside patio seating with misters. Lots of activities for the guests to enjoy!
Great selections of beers including many locals on tap. Mixed and well drinks available too!
Pretty impressive menu. We ordered their chicken wings ( hot & mango habanero) & calamari. Both were excellent. The calamari comes with a wasabi ranch that was delicious & really liked the grilled lemon wedge to squeeze on top of the seafood.
Bartenders on staff were professional. Attentive and taking care of all the patrons. At the end of our visit the head bartender came over and shook our hand and thanked us for coming. Now, that is what gives a place five stars! That is a kind gesture that sets this place to a higher standard. We will definitely be back to explore more of the menu and revile in this Sports Bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went here to watch a game on Saturday, we walked and had Lori as a server. She told us the happy hour specials. We ordered a beer, and being only 21 she did not ID, and then brought us the wrong beer. We got our food and needed a side of ranch and asked the host because the server was not around, and the host sat at the front and didn't get it. The food was average, we sat without water as the server passed MULTIPLE times, and even checked to see if we wanted more beer and still didn't give us refills till we asked. Felt like she had a attitude the whole time, made it a horrible experience. We got the bill, and the pricing didn't have the happy hour specials she told us about in the beginning. We asked her about it and again with a attitude she said it was the systems fault. She took off $2 dollars when it should have been $10. We waited for her to come back to take our card and we asked her about the pricing and she blamed it on the manager. She took the bill and then came back and said that happy hour was only mon-fri so there were actually no specials tonight, after we ordered and ate only from the happy hour menu? We asked to speak to a manager and she walked away and rolled her eyes. Came back and said she just gave us the discount and didn't tell the manager. We waited and didn't see him. So we finally just left. Will not be back, will not recommend."}
{"text":"Cool place at least the TV set up is on point. super slow service and it's not even that busy....waiting on drink orders can't even get a water table of 3 sat down after us and got their food before us not sure if I would be back or recommend to anyone unless you just want to watch the Chive TV channel probably the highlight of the night since the pats game was a blow out"}
{"text":"This place is a real Sports Bar... TV's everywhere with all the game you can imagine (even some on replay... its baseball season and I watching football!!)

Came here after a work volunteer event nearby and they were able to accommodate our large group (20+). We only had one server as we did come on a Thurs during Happy Hour and we kept her busy, but she was great to keep our orders organized and delivered as fast as possible. 

We order a series of appetizers ranging from the chicken wings with a variety of sauces (would recommend the \"Draft Sauce\") but the best was the dry rub wings!!! Something about dry rub brings out the flavor and I had the Lemon Pepper & Truffle Parmesan. And if you're doing Keto (like many in my group, you had plenty of options. The team pretty much ordered 1 of every appetizer and the only thing that was still standing was the nachos and that was because all the other items were pretty good. 

Personally, I went with the Cobb Salad and for the price, you get a pretty good size bang for your $$$. Make sure you come during happy hour as the draft beer specials are good and getting more (oz) cost you less then the normal size depending on your beer choice. Outdoor patio is nice (not much of a view) No good games were on that night we came so the atmosphere wasn't \"electric\" as I hoped, but it's clear when some main sporting event is on, this place is great."}
{"text":"I like beer. They sell it here. They have a great happy hour with lots of drinks I like. They also have lots of drinks I don't like. I don't have to drink those. They also have trivia. If you answer questions correctly you can win things. One time two milfs were hitting on me during trivia. . I could've probably hit that but I'm married and I love my wife. Infidelity is wrong. I'm in marriage counseling now. Ok bye."}
{"text":"I can see the great reviews. Service was great, and friendly. Went on a Monday night football night, and being a former Buffalo Wild Wings there were plenty of screens to view the game on. 

Had the wings which were well prepared, and hit the spot. Love the fact you can add a dry rub to the fries. Telling you the dill dry run, and fries are the bomb. Will definitely look to return."}
{"text":"A good looking sports bar, walking in at night makes it seems very bright inside. Not a dark dirty bar. Tvs everywhere not a place without. Full bar with plenty to choose from. Only bummer was on Friday they closed at 11p.m. I get the mesa area isn't busy but still would like to stay later only time for 2 rounds."}
{"text":"The wings were very good. Plenty of beer and drink options. Great place to watch the game. 15 big screen TVs with a couple very big screens. TVs all over the place. I didn't dive in to far into the menu as I was here for a Fantasy Football draft. They did give us some specials because we had our draft here.Will comeback and check it out again for sure."}
{"text":"First time here.   And our last. Service was horrendous.  Clearly understaffed.   After waiting 45 minutes.... for a quesadilla and an order of chicken wings.... and had not seen the server since placing the initial order...we gave up and left. Definitely do not recommend this pace."}
{"text":"They have a few items on the menu that are stellar! The house made salsa is amazing, the mac & cheese is great, and the fish tacos are pretty damn good. Very good local rotating beer selection & the bartender is awesome.

1 star knocked off because there is absolutely no atmosphere. It's like an empty strip mall store with a bar on one wall. Pretty plain. Overall it's a nice spot though, and if I lived close by I'd probably stop in regularly."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. This place was a hidden jem that we found randomly wanting to watch Sunday football. The whole experience was very rewarding. Would highly recommend if you like football and good food."}
{"text":"First time I went here the service was terrible.  Gave it another try, wanted to watch ufc and majority of the bar was reserved for the owner or for a birthday party. Rather go to Cactus Moon."}
{"text":"Three stars for the food.  The staff was nice but way too slow.  Prices seemed a little high for what we got.  It's pretty slow.  It's Arizona and there are 32 TV'S and not one had the Diamondbacks game on.  Not promising."}
{"text":"Love this place. Had the AZ spring rolls- decadent. Taco salad - awesome (fresh jalapeños rock!).  Great craft beers!  Perfect place to watch a game, nice patio.  Service is top notch. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been twice now and the decor and TV setup is a big plus. The atmosphere would probably be a lot better if it didn't feel so empty the two times we visited. The food selection was better than I thought, with a nice variety of choices. The burgers are pretty great and have nice options like pretzel bun, and fried egg options. The staff are all friendly, but may be more friendly than helpful. We'll definitely try to visit for brunch and at least one more dinner before making our final verdict, and we'll have to try the desserts of course as well."}
{"text":"The waiters are friendly and they have lots of options when it comes to drinks, the food menu is a little lacking but its good food."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful service. Had to ask each time for anything we needed. Took FOREVER. We waited over 20 min for them to bring us a bill. Meanwhile they asked several times if we were ready for the bill. One of the servers started helping us and then sat down to have a drink himself. Didn't transfer us to anyone, and we sat for a while with no service. We the. Asked for another round and it was not busy at all. Then once it started to get busy we really didn't see anyone. Asked for the bill 2 more times and got it 15 minutes later."}
{"text":"Everyone has a vice, right? I know I did. Past tense. So, without going into too much detail, I can't really partake in my former vice(s) anymore for various reasons and the stressors of life had really just been getting (or giving it) to me. That being said, I needed to drink! I'm just a fake ass drinker. I'm a Malibu and pineapple in the club girl. I always just order whatever my heaux friends are drinking (heauxs are fancy drinkers, don'tchaknow?) and I'm done with it but this time I wanted to try some different. I genuinely wanted to start drinking beer but I had no idea where to start and I'm actually really glad I started at The Draft with my co-worker friend who is a seasoned drinker. I had read enough Yelp reviews to know I wanted to get a flight and my friend walked me through their beer menu advising me to start with the lightest beers and to steer all the way clear of any IPAs until I was sure I liked beer, a lot. 

So in my flight I ended up ordering Big Blue Van (a blueberry beer, not my favorite), Orange Blossom (really unmemorable, I literally can't remember anything about it), Peach Ale (my second favorite, really light in flavor and taste), and Angry Orchard (ofc this would be my favorite, right? A hard cider!) After that, I ended up ordering I think it was called a Mom's Night Out or something to that effect, it had champagne and pureed strawberries and came in a martini glass. It was much boozier than I anticipated but I downed it so I clearly had no complaints. My friend and I also split some spring rolls which were more like egg rolls but were still super good. They weren't dense at all like some spring rolls I've had since moving to Arizona. The service was good, our waitress was attentive but not all over us. She checked in to see how we liked the beers we chose.

I ended up leaving there feeling a bit nice and with a new found appreciation of extremely light beer. I do plan on going back and I'd probably ask if we could go back again this week but I have a Vegas trip next week and I'm trying to prepare my body for being drunk for three days straight so we'll probably hit up another happy hour when I get back."}
{"text":"We went here for a famiy dinner food was expensive, fries were extremely salty some where hard, the burgers had a long list of what was on it but still tastless. The music was so loud it was hard to hold a conversation. Chicken wings didnt have flavor either, they were dry and had no meat on them. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"First time checking this sports bar out and the 5 stars goes to the service. We had Kelly B. As our server and she was very attentive. My husband and I were sitting on the patio, and as a former server, I know patio tables can be forgetful sometimes. She was constantly making sure we were ok and gave us good recommendations on the menu. The food was good as well. I had the double decker and my husband had the alamo burger. We were both satisfied!"}
{"text":"The first time we ate there it was really good. We decided to go back the next day. We went later on the evening and the food took forever and was cold when it came out. The waitress we had pretty much left is and we had to have someone else  help us. They brought the calamari back out and all they did was microwave it. Real rubbery so said we didn't even want that. Waited and waited for the chicken wings to be remade finally said forget it we are done. Then another 15 min to find the girl to get our check. She just stood at a table flirting with a couple guys. Left with only eating our dinner salads. Still Hungary!!"}
{"text":"Went on  Sunday night to watch the game. Good spot if that's all you're interested in. There are screens everywhere. 
The service was very poor. We kept having to get someone else to go find our waitress.  The wings looked liked they were freezer burned, and isn't celery green? Well what came out with the wings was what appeared to be white celery. The baileys on the rocks was very very skimpy. All quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Cold Beer& Lots of TV's with sports. Just what I needed. The staff is very friendly and made me welcome. Next time in Mesa, I will be ending my evening here."}
{"text":"Always amazing food & awesome staff! The Alamo on pretzel bun  so bomb! There is TVs everywhere you turn and the beer is never a fail!"}
{"text":"Hands down best sports bar in AZ. For starters, the place is a far cry from your typical cookie cutter corporate franchise (You know who you are buffalo wild wings). It also isn't employed by a bunch of high school kids or some jerks just showing up for a paycheck. This is a local small business and the only one of its kind. What's more is that these folks truly care about their customers and actually take the time to remember your name. I have to say that everybody is fantastic but I'd especially like to mention that OLIVIA and CRAIG are simply superstars and keep me coming back in every Sunday for, if not everything else than just for their great hospitality. Some key points from my experiences here.

The actual bar itself is clean and has a modern Ness to it that's very appealing to the eyes. I have been to many other establishments around the valley to catch football or basketball games and they all pale in comparison's. This place definitely offers every amenity you could hope for; Good quality TVs literally everywhere you look, fantastic food, an immense assortment of beers on tap including a great selection of craft beers as well as various wines, and also some killer food and drink specials every day of the week. 

I don't do reviews very often but I have seen a few off color comments among all the raving reviews and I just needed to chime in and set the record straight. I do not intend to stop patroning this hidden gem anytime soon."}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by this place. It feels like a brand-new interior, no true character of the establishment, and the food was mediocre. I can't speak to the beer selection, but the wine was meh. Happy hour prices were pretty noteworthy, though."}
{"text":"You cannot leave this place without indulging in the Snickerdoodle Spiked Milkshake! 

The staff is friendly and efficient. The manager came over and made some recommendations on the menu. He was right, the Fish Tacos were incredible. My boyfriend has had the Chicken and Waffles every time we come in to watch the game and loves it. I have already tried most of the appetizers, all were amazing. 

No matter where you are sitting in the bar, there's 100 TVs to accommodate your viewing pleasure. 

All my friends that are huge beer connoisseurs were thoroughly impressed with the drafts on hand. There is a digital screen to display the brews they have, thats pretty awesome, I've never seen that in a bar before. 

It has been long over due for a fabulous sports bar in the area. The bathrooms are updated and modern. The bar is classy with pops of color. Everything is new and high tech. Shuffleboard and music selection is there too (my fav!) Def a great Happy Hour spot or place to watch the game. Good job guys. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Staff was unbelievably rude and stuck up. The bread they serve is moldy!!! I ordered my meal and when i received it there was mold on the bread. I immediately told the server and she said she would take care of it, little did i know that meant \" let me have the kitchen staff  remove the mold\",  instead of remaking my meal with bread that was not moldy. I will not spend my money in this \"health hazard\"!!!! Not to mention the female servers are so hungry for tips that they hit on your husband right in front of you not realizing that the wife is the one paying. Never again!"}
{"text":"These guys aren't messin around....dee-lish. We came to watch the NBA Finals and had some fantastic local beer and magnificent burgers. Great environment and staff as well. Definitely a place to visit again."}
{"text":"Food is good but service was slow when we went there for lunch.  We were the only people in there !!  Maybe a bad day"}
{"text":"Love the Tuesday night Trivia! When you go, you have to get the boneless wings with the Draft sauce they are amazing!  Love the mimosa flights on the weekends too!"}
{"text":"Came in today because restaurant had good Yelp reviews and left very disappointed had to send food back. In Yelp reviews its says how great the wings are and how big they are well to my disappointment wings were horrible and probably the smallest wings I have ever had. In the picture my pinky was bigger then each wing. So my guess is all the Yelp reviews where either bought reviews or fake accounts I wouldn't recommend this place to any one. I didn't only order wings I ordered also big pretzels with there beer bacon cheese dip and it it tasted like powder cheese mixed with beer not very good. But on a plus side they had awesome guacamole dip and salsa with chips."}
{"text":"5 stars need I say more ??! Love the entire staff and oh love the great food ice cold beers with some of tha greatest regulars"}
