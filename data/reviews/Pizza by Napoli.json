{"text":"Their Pizza, Wings , and Calzones are so good. I love this place I'm sure everything they have is awesome but I haven't tried anything else. I'm looking forward to trying their fried mushrooms."}
{"text":"I dig this place. It has been around for as long as I can remember. My parents used to get it when I was a kid, but money was tight and they opted for Little Caesars usually. I live in the area again and wanted to try this place out again. The pizza was phenomenal! The crust was so good, my kid was even eating it (usually gives her scrapes to me). Everyone in my family enjoyed it, we will be going back here for sure."}
{"text":"Just got back from NYC and was already missing some good pie. The pizza here did not disappoint. It was my first time ordering from here and tried a large pepperoni pizza... it was perfect! It's not often that I find a pizza that gets all points from the tasty sauce, perfectly baked crust and good mozzarella. The family loved it and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A bit of an upset. 20 min after i placed my order, went to pick my pizza and wings. The pizza looked and tasted like it had been sitting out for an hour. The wings were still hot but unfortunately not as tasteful as they looked. Thought I'd try something new in the area but now I'll stick to what i know."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza joint around here.  If you want greasy, fatty, real Italian pizza.  This is a good place to start.  The wings are unbelievable so you have to get the special."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  The place is very clean and the staff is very friendly!!  Closest to NY style pizza in Arizona."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and wings....The calzone has a perfect ratio of cheese pepperoni and sauce! They have the best ranch dip too!"}
{"text":"We went to this location because the reviews were great ... But the food made us sick. The crust was dry and the whole pizza tasted like a regular frozen pizza we could have bought at the grocery store. The wings were okay. My brother sister and I were immediately sick after eating here . I would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Great little place! Saw some great reviews on this place so we stopped by on our way to \"Shooter's World\" for a quick dinner. Not fancy by any means but don't let appearances fool you. The Napolitana (thin) pizza is fantastic with a light, bubbly crust that has just the right amount if crisp to it. Got the medium hot wings which had fantastic flavor and zing as true buffalo wings should, and can't go wrong with the fried zucchini! We will definitely be back to Pizza by Napoli to try the Sicilian style!"}
{"text":"Pizza is great! Been enjoying it for 25 years. Used to walk there with friends as a kid and get pizza by the slice combo. Food and faces has not changed."}
{"text":"The pizza here is excellent! It's super thin and crunchy, great sauce. Really quick, friendly and relaxed service. I had a pepperoni slice and it was great!"}
{"text":"Pizza By Napoli is by far my favorite pizza place and one of my favorite places to eat overall.  They have a diverse menu consisting of different pastas, subs, salads, hot plates and of course pizza & wings.  The wings are the best I have ever had.  All the pizza from plain cheese all the way to the fully loaded Napoli Special are just delious.  I have been going there since 1997 and it has always been family owned and operated. They are ITALIAN, as they speak italian and i have spoken with the owner and family and they take turns going back to Italy during the summer for vacation. It's a small town a couple hours outside of Rome.  I can't pronounce it but its on the giant map of Italy that hangs in the restaraunt.  The prices have always been fair.  Back in 1997 it was $3.50 for 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink.  Today it is still $3.50 for the same quality.  35th ave & Thunderbird, SE corner near Subway.  I can't recommend this family owned and operated business enough."}
{"text":"Bland. Greasy. Not NYC style. Didn't give me the topping I ordered. Not sure where these other reviewers have eaten pizza, but the reviews are way off."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza and wings I have found in the West Valley.  I have only had great food and friendly service with this pizzaria and I have been going there for over 10 years now.  Keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the years and while I was going to give the pizza three stars, I'm certain that it deserves four. Especially because of the price ($12 for 17\" cheese pie).  This isn't fancy pizza, and in New York it would probably be considered average, but it's nice to find a place that makes something similar to what you'd find in NYC.  Yeah, as somebody else said, it can be greasy due to the amount of cheese, but if you must, just take a napkin and dab some of the grease off. The sauce, however, be sure not to dab that off. The sauce is rather delicious, with a pronounced tomato and basil flavor, in addition to some standard seasonings and sometimes I even taste a slight anchovy finish. I'm not sure about that one, though. I may just have had a few too many.  It's definitely not the best pizza I've ever had, but I just really like this place, even when sober."}
{"text":"I was on vacation and I found this particular restaurant through Yelp and what a great find it was!  My wife and I had lasagna and then we got a pizza to go. Both items were absolutely delicious. We also tried the house dressing on our salads. It was a kind of thick creamy Italian dressing and it was excellent. It's a small family run operation. The kind of place where you walk in and order at the counter and then have a seat. The place is very clean and well lit. It is located in a shopping center so there is plenty of parking.  So if you are looking for a good fairly priced Italian restaurant without any pretense check this one out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Giving five stars because pizza was so good!  Inside seating is nothing to rave about but I was there for the pie.  Can't speak to anything else on the menu because I've only had their pizza.  Reasonably priced, good pizza, close to home - what else could I ask for?"}
{"text":"Closest NY Pizza I can find here so far.  Being coming there for 25 + years and have loved each slice.  The family owned business is A rating and I suggest you try the Sicilian Pie.  Yummo"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this pizza place for years. They never disappoint.   The regular pizza is great but the Sicilian is divine. They've mastered the art a crispy chewy crust. So good! The toppings are fresh and the meats aren't the cheapo kind that leave the pizza swimming in grease.   I'm not a fan of hot wings but my family seems to like them. Their only complaint is that the hot wings aren't really hot and they don't serve them with blue cheese and ranch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to do when I move to a new city is try to find good pizza. Not an easy task, but I have succeeded in Dallas, TX and Chapel Hill, NC. I'm not talking about fancy-shmancy coal oven pizza (although I do like that occasionally). Rather, I'm talking about a good solid slice. The kind you fold, and the point stays parallel to the ground...doesn't bend like a wet noodle.   Tommy (Brooklyn native) and his crew have the recipe down pat (with all of the NY attitude). Best slice I've had in Phoenix, by far.  If you're up in Cave Creek, Tommy's brother owns a place called #1 brothers - also very good.   I look forward to trying their Chicken and Eggplant parm sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This is tasty pizza. The wings are a decent size. My family of 4 got the special of a large pizza and 25 wings and we paid less then $28.00 for it. Great prices. Wonder quality."}
{"text":"Eat this pizza. They have what ALL Phoenix restaurants lack...consistency. The Sicilian is great, the dough is crispy and buttery and the sauce is herby."}
{"text":"Advertised hours for Saturday until 1130 pm- I called to place a pick up order at 1043 and was told they were already shut down for the night. Why say you're open late but won't accommodate your customers??"}
{"text":"i have been going to this place for at least 20 years me and my brother have probably bought enough food there to send at least on of their kids through college. the food is always good the only downside is they don't deliver so i have to haul my butt out of the house to bring it home. the food has been consistantly good for ever the sicilian pizza should be illegal it is so good..if you go on some days it is warm in there but still nothing a cold beer wont fix which goes well with pizza and wings the wings are good too..i am italian and also from the big apple and this place takes me back home i always recommend them to other new yorkers espescially when they say there is no good pizza in phoenix. if you want atmosphere fugeddaboutit not here.. but good pie you bet..."}
{"text":"Yumm!!! Seriously tasty pizza and wings. I usually order my food to go. They are fast and friendly. Pizza is always made fresh, not that rubbery chewy pizza from chain restaurants."}
{"text":"If you like your non chain pizza restaurants then this is the place to go! This is your typical family owned place that servers awesome pizza and calzones. There calzones are huge and I always have left overs. The prices are excellent and they offer quite a few specials! Give it a shot, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and the quality of the food hasn't been consistent. The pizza itself is great. Nice thin crispy crust especially if u get it right out of the oven. The sauce has a tangy kick to it. A bit different tasting than your standard marinara but it works. The slices are huge and tasty.   I would recommend taking your food to go as the inside of the place smells strongly of fried oil. Seems that they fry a lot  of chicken. It can be smoky in there at times and your clothes and hair definitely smell like grease when you leave.   Speaking of oil... The first time I tried the hot wings I was quite impressed. I'm constantly on the hunt for good hot wings. Nice crispy wings with a great simple hot sauce. Today I tried again and the meat was very fibrous and hard to chew. It tasted like the aforementioned frying oil was old and made the wings taste dirty. I'm curious to know how often they change out their oil. I think I came in on the tail end of that schedule.   I'll be back but I'll stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Ray's Pizza at 59th/Greenway.  I find the pizza at Napoli to be quite similar if not exactly the same.  I think Napoli does the crust better.  Wings are good too."}
{"text":"If you want some large and Amazingly tasty pizzas, than this is the place to go! Great pizzas for a great price"}
{"text":"That was a complete waste of time and money. The wings were so skimp and bare and burnt, hardly any sauce on them and they wouldn't give me extra ranch to compensate for the excessively dry wings. The \"hoagie\" had disgusting processed ham on them. Come on, 6$ for a hoagie \"meal\" with processed meat. If I wanted processed meat I could have gone to McDonald's. So gross! Also the slice specials, were simply cheese. Just cheese. Any extra toppings were charged by each. Come on people, don't waste your time or money and go somewhere who cares what they send their customers."}
{"text":"Pizza by Napoli will always have a place in my heart. I have been frequenting this place for over 7 years now and NOT ONCE has it compromised in taste, style or service. I know when I go there years from now, I will get to enjoy every reason that makes this place special for me. Taste-wise, I can speak for the pizza, wings and beer as this is all I ever want when I go...BECAUSE THERE SO DAMN GOOD!!! The pizza has an amazing taste to the sauce that can only be experienced and that will hopefully one day be recognized as the sauce all pizza should use! The wings have a nice crunchiness but are still traditionally bathed in an awesome wing sauce and worth every bit of mess you make of yourself. The beer is served right and makes the food that much better. When I say served right; I'm speaking of the thick, LARGE, glass pitcher that you could use to battle any incoming zombies or just use it to fill up the ice dripping mugs! Keep in mind, this place has a huge menu so don't think there only as good as pizza and wings. Best of all is it is very affordable as I have never thought I paid too much and if your looking for a cheap lunch special, they have it! As for atmosphere, it is very down to earth, no frills, just some beer signs and simple pictures of Napoli or some far off Italian hillside. The exact same group of guys has been there every time I have went and I actually don't know if they ever leave. Every time you see them they are cleaning or breaking down some machine to clean because it took a beating during lunch time. These guys have an awesome \"tough as nails\" Italian attitude and can come off pushy when placing your order for lunch but for god sake it's lunch time; it's busy, live with it! For dinner, you order it up front and then they bring it to you instead of picking it up from the front and don't worry, at this time the guys are all very gracious. Overall, this place is a classic and if your looking for great pizza in Phoenix; this is your place, if you just feel like something a little better for a pizza to take home; this is your place; if you want a genuine, down to earth experience; this is your place!"}
{"text":"Pizza is real authentic, the sauce, the cheese, the crust... Absolutely love their napoliana crust."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay, thin and swimming in grease, which is a good thing in my mind.   But when I walked in one of the employees was smoking in the restaurant. Did he put it out when a customer walked in?    No, he took a long defiant drag while staring at me.   Kind of shocking for this day and age.  Bathroom smelled like the employees do most of their smoking in there."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot that we frequent quite a bit. The calzones are awesome and the lunch special they have is perfect. No frills with this place, just simple and good food."}
{"text":"Great lunch special! 2 slices and a drink for under $6! Good decent food at a great price."}
{"text":"A family owned restaurant that has great prices, great food and a great atmosphere.  Someone mentioned that the inside is kinda \"meh.\" But when you go into this place you will understand that it is just a mom and pops place. It has a lot of character and most importantly THEY KEEP IT CLEAN.  Their crust is always crunchy and their pizza is fresh. They are kind and love what they do. Try their calazones and their hot sandwiches. To die for.  Priced right for lunch or dinner and great to get for sport events at the house."}
{"text":"Really good food! Service is fast. Wings are amazing!! They make them a little extra crispy! BOMB"}
{"text":"First time in here and love this place!!  This place is genuine and really good.  A friend and I tried a few things from the big menu board that covers the the top portion of the wall behind the counter. We had the large antipasto salad, the two slice lunch special, and the meatball sandwich. The food was very good and plentiful.  The pizza crust was thin and crisp enough to hold the cheese and sauce yet a little chewy like it should be. Good solid sandwich. Hearty meatballs with tasty sauce covered with plenty of cheese.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was four years old. Im 32. Everything is amazing. Pizza. Grab a few slices or get a pie. Get some wings and don't you dare forget the hoagie special! Meat cheese dressing I'm weird they know when I call. My only problem is I don't eat it enough. My favorite restaurant in the state of arizona."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I like to stop by when I have to make a Fry's Electronics run. My favorite, beside a slice and salad, is their eggplant parm sandwich. I think they are one of the best in the in the Valley. (See my photo) I order the eggplant sandwich with a side of pepperchinies. Highly recommended.   Staff is always friendly. A real family operated business, and always friendly."}
{"text":"Pizza really is just ok. New York style pizza and it tastes like it but not even the best pizza in 5 square miles. Ray's on 55th and Thunderbird is a bit better than this.   Crust is too thick and cakey, kinda chewy too. Not enough cheese. Just underwhelming really, but not bad."}
{"text":"Have been going to Napoli's since we got out to Arizona last July. The pizza is super comparable to places like Giordano's in Chicago. It is very good very filling and always ready on time"}
{"text":"I completely agree with what the other reviewers have written about the staff here and the interior. The interior obviously hasn't been changed in ages. But that's great, because it reminds me so much of a pizza parlor my family used to frequent when I was a kid.   The guy behind the counter was totally an extra from a mob movie. I wouldn't be surprised if he was in the Witness Protection Program. He called me \"sweetheart\" a lot, and it was very endearing and not offensive. It's all about the tone, you know?  As for the food, the pizza crust and sauce were top notch. I loved the crust especially. It was more on the thin side, and light and crispy. A sign in the shop boasts that they make their dough daily. I believe it.  Other items didn't fare as well. The toppings were sub-par. The Italian sausage was weird little BBs of meat, and they use canned mushrooms. Canned mushrooms are a peeve of mine, yet I always forget to ask if that's what they use.  The antipasto salad was 90% iceberg lettuce, with a few thin shavings of sub meat and cheese on top, a tablespoon of black olives, and one pepperoncini. The dressing was of the goopy Italian variety, like you'd find at a salad bar.  I would go back, but would just have pizza, and I would choose my toppings carefully."}
{"text":"Nice homey feeling at this family ran business.  Found it on yelp looking for a place to have some pizza on a side of phoenix I want familiar with.  The pizza was great with its big slices, im a big guy and was filled up after two, but the hot wings stole the show. Nice and crispy just the way we like them with just enough sauce. The service was warm and inviting and we will definitely go back if ever on that side of town again."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years. I have tried everything on the menu at  least a half dozen times. It's all good there is no such thing as bad wings, pizza subs spaghetti or salads . Great portion sizes . Very friendly help. It's a family owned business from New York. It doesn't get any better than this. Pizza is take out only, but man is it good.....once again all of it. Lol"}
{"text":"Better lunch prices than the fast food chains. I've been coming here for years.  Actually, back in the day when I still lived on this side of town, I ate here 3-6 times per week.  My favs include the antipasto salad, steak special + jalapenos sub, and fried mushrooms.  You can't beat the 2 slice lunch special for like 4 bucks i think.  The pizza &  wing special is classic.   Family owned by Italian guys with humor.  Sheck 'em out!  I wish they had one of these on the Eastside and then I wouldn't have 2 wonder what I'm having 4 dinner everynite.     ;' ("}
{"text":"So I know I'm annoying because ever since I moved to Arizona, I've complained about not finding food up to par with what I like or am use to at home.  It's different. However, Pizza by Napoli isn't different.  The pizza tastes like NYC style pizza, but its not its Arizona pizza and I love it.  The sauce, cheese and crust are tasty and even. The people who work their are nice and polite.  The place is always very clean.  They have plastic plants all around and usually when you walk into a restaurant that has plastic plants they are dusty, not here.  Neither are the lamp shades dusty, which is rare even for the nicest of places. My one gripe will be that when they fry chicken it can smell strongly of frying and oil.  It's not the most appealing thing ever.   However, Pizza by Napoli is a gem.  They serve hot delicious pizza that is above par almost all other pizza places in AZ.  I look forward to trying more of their food."}
{"text":"The real Italians running this place are great with the heavy accents and customer service. Now for the pizza! Yummo, delicious, best in town!"}
{"text":"Pizza By Napoli how I love thee.  This is how I would picture a little mom and pop shop in the big city back east.  Everyone speaking in thick italian accents and the type of people you would love to have as friends.  I always order the large meatball pie and my friends, it fuggin rules.  Thin slices of what you know are a great italian grandmas recipe passed on for generations.  Great mild sauce and thin and crispy crust.  This is in my top 5 pizza joints in AZ falling only to Nellos.  The dine in experience is a must, old school booths, old school arcade games, sports on the TV.  It reminds me of a time before the 30 minutes or its free delivery craze.  When people would sit down and enjoy a pie right out of the oven.  Even the high chairs are old school and full of metal.  If you call in take out, remember your assigned number given on the phone.  They'll love you for it.  In closing, Napoli kicks arse frenz...................."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 25+ years, grew up in the neighborhood.  Good lunch specials with great food. Pizza, wings, pasta and sandwiches....something for everyone. Plain and simple joint with no frills....my kinda place.  I recommend the hot hoagie with a side of their amazing dressing."}
{"text":"I have been going to this awesome little pizza joint for over 20 years.  It might not be as long as some others who have reviewed this restaurant but I think it is enough to say I have eaten here a few times before.  The first thing I started eating was very simple, pizza and wings.  It really is a great combo and I have never been disappointed.  Cheese to the works will surely satisfy.  My wife likes getting sausage and mushroom while I am just fine with a pepperoni topping.  I have to say whatever we get I really don't mind because it will be good.  The wings are just as good as the pizza.  They are well cooked, the sauces are graded just right between the desired flavor and heat and just like the pizza they have never disappointed.  Don't question if you should get them, just how many.  After a few years of pizza and wings I looked up one day while at the counter and noticed they had a menu!  On that menu is everything you can think of in a pizzeria style restaurant.  Subs, salads, calzones, fried cheese sticks, and the list goes on.  I will only touch on a couple of items.  The next thing I really was addicted to was the steak and cheese.  I started eating them with mushrooms and peppers but over time I ended eating them with just the steak and cheese.  Hot, delicious steak, perfectly melted cheese all stuffed into wonderful bread which is then toasted at the end.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water.  I also have been known to get a calzone from time to time.  I have had them all and each is about the size of a couch cushion.  I have never been able to finish one in a single sitting but the flavor really tempts you to try.  No bother; take it home and finish it when your appetite returns.  Reheating is a sin but not taking the rest home to finish it is a bigger sin.  I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the family that runs the restaurant.  Having gone here for over 15 years I have grown with them almost.  I have literally seen their children grow up and now a few of them can be seen behind the counter giving you the same great service I have known all this time.  Those who go enough know that you get a little extra conversation when you walk through the doors.  I try and understand everything they say but I rarely get everything between the thick accents.  Overall a great place to go get your meal.  Lunch or dinner, alone or with the family, you will get great food.  I have a warning though; you may not want to go to Pizza by Napoli if you live far away.  I moved away and now have to drive 20 miles to get my old favorite.  Small price to pay."}
{"text":"Always a treat. Family owned and it's been the same people for as long as I can remember. Their food is tasty and is perfect for a quick bite or for watching any sporting event at the house. The pizza and wings special is delicious. Best way to order their pizza/wings is 'well-done'. Great sandwiches too. I've witnessed them cleaning every inch of the kitchen area on multiple occasions, even as far behind major appliances as they can go on a nightly basis."}
{"text":"Since the sale of and subsequent closure of Paesanos on 43rd Ave and T-bird, I've been in search of a replacement. While nothing will really be Paesanos, Pizza by Napoli is a decent enough substitute in the Glendale area that satisfies the craving and doesn't make leave you disappointed.   Crust is just crusty on the outside with a little doughiness on the inside...just right. The sauce is just the right balance of acid and sweet. The cheese is very fresh and not overwhelming. The pepperoni wasn't greasy at all so you know that they get the good stuff. Overall, a nice pie that makes you look forward to more!"}
{"text":"My first time here.   My girlfriend and I came here on a Sunday night for dinner. We walked in and the first thing I noticed was the arcade to the left up against a wall. The man said hello to us and asked if we were ready to order, we grabbed a Togo menu and started lookin thru it. We decided on a medium pizza with pepperonis and jalapeños. We also added 12 piece fried zucchini & 2 medium drinks. The man told us to pay later since we were dining in. We sat and waited.  The zucchini came out hot & delicious! Accompanied with their awesome ranch.  About 10 minutes went by & then the pizza. The pizza was SO TASTY! Hot & cheesy with not too much sauce which I loved. Definitely some of the best pizza in the valley! And best zucchini I've ever had. I've lived in quite a few states and have had my fair share of pizza lol. So GOOD JOB Napoli!   Def will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Girlfriend recommended this place, was impressed. Definitely better than any pizza chain like Dominos or Pizza Hut. Slices were large, thin, crunchy and very fairly priced. Definitely will return in the near future."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place!! The best NY style pizza that is not physically in NY! Awesome pies and their Sicilian is just as AWESOME!! This place is no joke! Awesome food, perfect crust, tasty sauce, good cheese, and it's not a greasy mess of a slice!  I am a regular at this place and have been there countless times already and will keep going back!! Their meatballs are awesome! Their cheese sticks are good! Their pasta and sauce is awesome!! I highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Gave them a try and it was alright. Prices are on the high side but they have been at this location for many years so they must be doing something right. Just not my cup of tea is all."}
{"text":"There is a pizza God, for prayers have been answered I didn't even know I was making. These folks are authentic.  That was the best darn veggie and chicken pizza I have ever had. I can't even begin to explain the difficulty I have with finding pizza exactly the way I want it since I'm pollo-pescetarian. It's so freaking hard to find places with chicken as an option. Tender chicken, big fresh vegetables, lots of cheese, crispy on the bottom... hell yes! Btw, there's beer too."}
{"text":"If ye on thee west side, ye must indulge thine's hunger with Pizza by Napoli.  This is your basic pizza joint.  Nothing special, just damn good NY style pizza.  They have cheap lunch slice specials.  Anytime I'm over in this area I'll hit up a couple of slices here... they still remember me from when I lived in the area and it's been like 3 years.  Ironically, the family that owns it looks mobster like, but they're from Albania, not Sicily."}
{"text":"This is the second closest pizza place to us and while they don't deliver, they are definitely our go to for pizza. As a girl from Chicago, it's surprising this would be my favorite near-by pizza place since its NY style but it's always delicious, consistent, and the guys at the counter are friendly."}
{"text":"Good pizza and above average wings!  Pizza was good, not great.  The pizza lacked a bit of flavor but was not bad at all.  The wings were on point!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here!  Staff is a bit rough about  the edges (not very friendly)  but good  food!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large mushroom and olive Napoliatana style pizza and it was far better than the pepperoni I had last time.  The herbs in the sauce came through much better and the crust was wonderful."}
{"text":"Moved to Chicago 6 months ago. I am in desperate need to find pizza like Napoli's has! I can't find it! This place has great pizza and wings - I miss it. I think I am going to cry....."}
{"text":"I love this place. Anytime we are in the neighborhood we have to get it! It's kind of a hill in the wall place so we always get it to go. The crust isn't too thick or thin and the sauce is really flavorful. The toppings are standard toppings. This is not a fancy pizza place by any means. You won't find trendy here, but it is really good, traditional, New York style pizza. They also have a lunch special for five dollars. Love!"}
{"text":"O m g.    Stumbled on to this place by accident.  My new favorite pizza spot.   To bad i live all the way in chandler......    pizza by far the best i had iin a long time.  Staff was very friendly and very helpful"}
{"text":"Been coming here 20+ years.  Just had a birthday party for 17 yr old my son Sal.  This is his favorite pizza parlor.  He loves the pizza but now he is a hot wing man.  The ranch dressing in combo with the different levels of hot wings sauce was a perfect combo. We got 4 different x-large pies.  They not only looked impressive in size but so delicious.  We suggest you try it.  Your going to be glad that you did."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a while.  Good pizza & subs.  Really love the wings!!!  Good lunch specials."}
{"text":"Make Great Success, The Pizza By Napoli Way!  1. Find a major road (in this case Thunderbird) and set up shop at the nearest available crossroads. Don't worry about location, though. Given the size of Phoenix, the chances that you'll be a five-minute drive from AT LEAST THREE other dine-in pizza places is pretty low.  2. Decorate the place once, and leave it. In the pizza game, you can never look too \"vintage\".  3. The one or two guys with the heaviest accents? Put them on the register. You want to look authentic.  4. Don't waste time worrying about a \"diverse menu\". Just serve the same pizza and wings as your competition. People don't eat pizza for the taste, they eat it for nostalgia, and with that decades-old decor and Old World accents, NOBODY will be more nostalgic than you, baby!  5. Charge extra for everything. Soda refills. Ranch cups. When they gotta pay fifty cents more for it, it tastes better. It's science.   6. Since you're right by ASU West, why don't you offer a lunch special for all of those hungry students? Hey now, don't get ahead of yourself. Just offer two slices of your most generic (in this case, cheese) pie at a \"reduced\" price. If you make the slices light enough, they'll spring for a third or some wings. After eating Aramark food the other four days a week, college students will pay stupid coin for \"authentic\" pizza with a quirky \"retro\" feel.   7. Don't tell anyone that you're actually from Albania, and not Sicily. You'll lose your street cred.  8. Uh...we thought we could stretch this out to 10 but that's really all you need. Oh, if you want you can set up an arcade machine (preferably one of a, yup, you guessed it, a 2D fighter...see? You're getting where we're coming from) in the corner just in case they don't want to spend their fifty cents to refill their mountain dew. You'll get those bastards one way or another.  9...Very nice!?"}
{"text":"Our family LOVED the Pizzas.  The staff was very friendly to us.  We ordered Pepperoni & Sausage and a Cheese Pizza. The crusts was crunchy!  Even the bottom of the pizza!  By far the best meal we had on our AZ vacation.  Too bad we found it on our last night.  We will be back again next year during our Spring Training vacation.  Leaving there left me craving more!   It was not crowded and it was quiet.  Very comfy and casual."}
{"text":"I have one complaint. I ordered a pizza with green peppers on it and they were the worst green peppers I've had in my life. I picked them all off and the pizza was pretty good.  So I'll go there again and just avoid the green peppers."}
{"text":"Napoli is a great place to eat. Yummy thin crust pizza. Crispy wings in a thin sauce. Good pasta. But my favorite are their calzones! Very delicious! Yummy salty ricotta in them too! If you want one I would suggest ordering ahead because it takes a little longer to cook! Been to Napoli many times!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for over 20 years and it's still amazing! Pizza is perfect and the wings are always crispy and not drowning in sauce."}
{"text":"This place has some great food and decent prices! I very much enjoyed it, my husband the pizza connoisseur lol said that the pizza was not crispy enough for him, but i don't like crispy pizza and thought it was great. The only thing I would suggest is for you to update your website as it is very basic, it does not have very much information. There is a link at the bottom of the page that takes you to some random search and there is also a type-o at the bottom!!! If you re-vamp your website maybe look into online ordering and offer changing specials up to keep people checking back to see what you are offering that day, week or even update monthly."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for lunch many times, and the lunch special is a great value and a decent slice of pizza.  They don't skimp on the toppings either.    I have tried most of the menu since I first wrote this.  Calzones are quite good, but a little different than most I have tried.  They put a little bit of cream cheese in the ricotta mix and I really like it.  Wings are fairly standard pizza joint wings.  Nothing really sets them apart, but they are good.  The sandwiches I have tried have all been good as well.  The meatball sub is tons better than the chain right next door.  Large meatballs, real mozz, and a good amount of sauce.    I used to eat at Lucky's in North Peoria all the time and this place really reminds me them.  Thin crispy crust with a nice amount of crunch and chew.  Nothing like the pre-made garbage you get at the chains.  You can tell this dough is made fresh.    Don't expect high end fixtures or fancy toppings, just good basic pizza at a good price."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. I prefer to get takeout since the inside is a little...eh... but who cares if the food's good! I love the crust, crispy and slightly chewy. The pizza can be a little greasy sometimes (but hey, it's pizza), but as long as it doesn't soak through and make the crust all flimsy (which has never happened with the pizzas I get here!) it's nothing that a paper towel or two can't fix! I'm not a big wing person but my dad has had them and he says they're pretty good.  The staff has always been super-friendly, and they actually remember me, even though I only come in once every couple months!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian experience! Pizza was delicious while the servers were rather well versed in their menus and in their customers. I loved everything!"}
{"text":"Another great pizza from this place. This  pic is the Sicilian with pepperoni."}
{"text":"My favorite local pizza joint. The sauce is spot on and the crust is thin. I've been coming here for years, and I've never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great wings, good pizza, great service. Overall, a positive experience. The dining area is very small and cramped but it's not a big deal (just try to avoid going with parties larger than 6... (4 is the best number for the seating they have available)  Also, they have only one beer on tap: Bud Light. But it's only $7.50 a pitcher (which also happens to be just a $1.50 more than a pitcher of soda) so the price is right at least.   I definitely want to go back to try them again."}
{"text":"Excellent wings and pizza. I love the Baked Ziti which comes with bread and salad. It actually has ricotta cheese with the noodles just like back east. We have been coming here since it opened 25 + years. We moved out of the neighborhood but still drive back to eat the food and visit with the family. Once you try the place you will remain a customer for life."}
{"text":"Pizza is like genuine NY pizza. They hand make crust and put it in brick oven. Their lunch specials are many n pretty good deals. Mozz sticks are good n deep fried as they should be. Marinara sauce is good. Ambience is just meh but food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Good pizza when you have a craving for them.  Stay away from the vegetable toppings as they aren't that fresh.  Probably canned which is acceptable, but nothing to waste money for.  The pizza is on point when it comes to the crust."}
{"text":"I love pizza but didnt like howthe edges of the deep dish were so hard :( next time will order thin crust, sauce is really good here:)"}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times over the years. It's owned/run by actual New Yorkers (though not 100% sure if they're Italian) and the style of food reflects that. The pizza slices are thin, greasy and huge - REAL pizza - and then reheated in a brick oven to order as well as new pizza baked fresh throughout the day. I got two large cheese slices and a drink for less than $4. Good food, good deal."}
{"text":"Great place, the service is awesome and I love the pizza and wings. The best ranch dressing anywhere. We always have to get extra."}
{"text":"Pizza is good. Pretty normal flavor for this type of place.  The charging for refills annoys me and the service is subpar but they have a cheap lunch special.  They do have an outstanding ranch though.  I don't know what the secret is but it's the bomb."}
{"text":"Love the pizza and the wings are soaked in my favorite buffalo sauce. Finger-licking good!"}
{"text":"The greatest place in the world. When the hot pizza hits my lips I get a warm sensation of hope and the light of the lord shines down upon thee."}
{"text":"I've only been to Napoli's Pizza about once or twice before, nothing special about it. The pizza was pretty decent for its price. The staff wasn't the friendliest. Visiting this last time I've became DISGUSTED once I realized that one of the older staff members (possibly the owner of the restaurant) was SMOKING in the door way of the kitchen/prep area!!! With no care in the world! He was just standing there staring everyone down while he blew his smoke towards the dining room area!! I was livid and left soon after. I hope they get reported to the health department!"}
{"text":"We're new to the area and trusted the reviews for this place and the other reviews were dead on; really good pizza from a neighborhood place. We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My favorite local pizza place!  Started going here when my siblings were in high school and got hooked on Napoli's lunch special: 2 slices of cheese and a drink.  Haven't changed my order since! Except of course the addition of hot wings with a side of ranch. The slices are huge, the wings are mouth watering, and the guys behind the counter are the real deal!"}
{"text":"Pizza by Napoli is truly the next best thing to NYC pizza here in Phoenix. I love this \"Mom & Pop\" pizzeria and their burgundy wine served in a Huge frosty mug for $4.00!! Best wine-by-the-glass deal in town too! Wings are incredible and their eggplant parmigiana sub is superb! Mangia!"}
{"text":"YIKES!  There is no way this place deserves five stars!  The pizza was so bad I had to go to Fry's to get something else for lunch... but then again, I guess at $4 for two slices and a drink, you get what you pay for. 'Homey' is not a word I would use to describe this place.  The family of aggressively accented men who run the place are probably the most interesting thing about it... but it's not enough to make up for the rest of it.  I am definitely not coming back.  Just gross."}
{"text":"I was at Frys Electronics on W. Thunderbird getting a few things and needed a quick lunch.  Found this place on Yelp.  Stopped in.  Got the lunch special of Cheese pizza slices and a drink for I think it was like $4!  Great pizza, big 16 oz drink.  GREAT DEAL."}
{"text":"I like this spot, tastes good compared to other pizzerias I tried in AZ, bread is not rubbery, their regular slices are good, but I really didn't like their vege pizza which mostly had onions and bell peppers, no broccoli no mushrooms, but I would still recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great lunch combo price and pizza is delicious overall. Very good crust. The only thing I'd suggest is slightly happier customer service, but not a dealbreaker! Food is of good quality."}
{"text":"The best pizza in town.  Always on point. Come by and support your local pizza parlor. You will be satisfied."}
{"text":"My boyfriend eats here often. I'm not a big pizza or calzone fan like him. But I love a meatball sub. I came here tonight cuz the subway next door was closed. I didn't realize I could get such a bettrr sandwich next door. And they were open late! Totally  recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for spaghetti with meatballs, salad and garlic bread but didn't want to sit in a restaurant alone so I stopped at Napoli for to go order.  Disappointment multipled.  Unappealing flavor for spaghetti sauce, pasta not done enough, garlic bread turned out to be a sub roll that I had to turn into garlic bread at home myself, no salad included in take out orders and so so meatballs.  Frowny faces from the guys working there.  Only bright light was the woman who smiled out me when she handed me my drink."}
{"text":"Never have I EVER been treated so rudely by an employee until I came here for a postmates pick up."}
{"text":"I noticed one of the employees pulling lettuce out of a tub to make my salad without washing his hands first.  When I approached him about it he became defensive and frustrated as if I was being a jerk. Then they were obstinant when it came to rectifying the situation. I said I didn't want the salad and paid without any sort of apology."}
{"text":"I have been enjoying their pizza for 10 years!!  Always receive a consistent yummy cheese pie!  I have also ordered their spaghetti which is credible as well.  This place is always packed- they offer good decent food, generous portions for a reasonable price. It's not fancy- but it is delicious."}
{"text":"I grew up in Miami Florida and was use to the Best New York Pizza which is not easy to find in Phoenix. Yes Arizona has been rated as having the best pizza in the nation but New York pizza has a life of its own - you know it when u taste it- smell it - it is special. I looked for it many years here in Phoenix and found some great pizza but wasn't finding the pizza from my childhood - big flat cheesy tasty pizza that you gotta fold and eat! Then I found Napoli's I LOVE THIS PLACE! Not only do they have east coast pizza they have AMAZING eggplant Parmesan that speaks to my soul. The menu is extensive and GREAT! We love it all!"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Pizza By Napoli since being first introduced to them by my wife some 20 years ago, and I must say that hands down, there is no other pizza joint that meets the measure of quality in their food preparation.  As soon as you walk in the door you are greeted with a hearty \"hey buddy\" and a request to take your order. That, in and of itself, provides the kind of feel good atmosphere that my family enjoys. Couple that with the time frame in which it takes to put out your order and you leave feeling as though you have made a group of friends for life.  From the steak, cheese, and onion subs to the meatball calzones, and last, but certainly not least, the family favorites - large sausage, onion, and cheese, and extra cheese pies - these fine gentlemen have always surpassed our expectations.  Over time, some of the faces have changed, but by and large it is the same group of men (and in some instances, women) who have taken care of us.   Pizza By Napoli will always be our go to pizza joint, as - from our experience - there has been no other that can compete with them."}
{"text":"Seriouosly great cheese pizza. I live on the other side of town and make my way over here just for the pizza.  The best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Kids and I had the pizza and wings special. The hot wings were crispy perfect and just hot enough. The pizza came out shortly after the wings. The sauce was the best I've tasted in a long time with a hint of oregano but not overpowering. The price was definitely right and the kids gave the final seal of approval with both of them saying \"we have to come back here\". Needless to say, we will be back!"}
{"text":"I am lucky I moved close to this place a few years ago, or I may never have known about this gem! The place is run by family and the pizza is the best in the valley. You can never go wrong with a pie from here and the service is top notch!!! Don't miss out on this joint. I promise, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I normally don't give 5 stars unless it really deserves it. I love this place, they have great pizza, beer, arcade, and always have the D'Backs on when I come in. They have just one beer on tap, Bud Light. Its ice cold and delicious. The hot wings are awesome. The Sicilian pizza is outstanding. I have tried the pasta it is amazing and it's like a full meal for four people. If you come here it might take a few minutes to get the pizza but it is damn worth it.!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this little hole in the wall pizza joint.  By far the best pizza and wing place my wife and i have ever been to.  We've been coming here for years,  and it's always consistent,  great every time.  The family that owns it and runs it are awesome as well.  We've eaten there and taken it to go too, and every time just as good as the last.  Be sure to check this place out."}
{"text":"Good hole in wall restaurant.  Very nice guys.  Ordered large pepperoni pizza with wings and a pitcher of pop.  Thin and tasty fresh crust.  Wings were good.  Loud baseball game!  Sticky menus.  Overall good, cheap meal and nice experience.  If in area, we'd go again."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. They don't deliver but I never mind going to pick it up. Nice family owned business. Friendly guys, great pizza crust, and while I wish the wings were crisper, they're still pretty tasty."}
{"text":"These guys have some of the top wings in the valley. They are crispy, tangy, medium sized wings, good ranch. New York Style Pizza is also on point, crispy on the bottom, great taste. Get here before 4pm for the lunch specials, saves money and is a good size portion. Grade A-"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years.  Awesome place to run in get a slice and a beer and be out in 15 min. It has been owned by the same family forever, Good folks who work hard and put out good food fast."}
{"text":"I'm a connoisseur of pizza and have to say the NY style pizza here is great. I've tried many pizza places around the valley and keep coming back to Pizza by Napoli. Crust is thin yet crisp and tasty. The pizza is not dripping with grease like many other pizza joints. Buffalo wings are great. It's family owned and operated. I only wish they'd get better TV's, especially when sporting events are on. You have to try it at least once."}
{"text":"Pizza here is actually really good. The crust is nice and crisp, just like i like it. Refills are not free (soda) and their other menu items are not impressive. Get the pizza!"}
{"text":"So we tried Pizza by Napoleon Hill the first time after my wife was given a single sample slice we compared to many other pizza's we've had in the valley over the years and tonight I have to say I'm very impressed with their New York style pizza as well as the flavor of the crust, Sauce Cheese I got to say really awesome Pizza"}
{"text":"Cheese pizza with toppings.  Get what I mean? They bake cheese pies, than add the toppings as you order then reheat it.  So the Pepperoni fat doesn't mingle with the cheese or sauce!! Not too mention..... The cooks are in the kitchen smoking cigar!! Not vaping but full on ashes on the floor!! Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love this place. I get their calzone and extra sauce. Their sauce is outstanding. I have a sensitive stomach when it comes to sauces and their sauce does not upset my stomach at all. I am new to this area and saw signs for them, but wasn't sure how to find them. Once I did I am still coming back to them!"}
{"text":"This  place  is     fast  , clean   and  always delicious.   Sicilian  pie  is  available, but  my  preference  is thin, crunchy crust  with   easy cheese.   Guys up  front  know their  business Been  eating here  for  years   and they  have  probably the   best calzone around and it's  not 15.00           Give them a   try"}
{"text":"Pizza dough was chewy.. Wings were average..pizza reminded me of something I would get on a boardwalk or at a sporting event.. Average at best.. It narrowly avoided 1 star"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, and there's a very good reason for it! There are tons of pizza joints, but if you want better pizza than in NYC, GO TO NAPOLI'S! I could live off of their wings alone. The place is family-run, and it's local, so they keep everything tasty and fresh. They are loyal to loyal customers and really get to know you, if you go enough! It's fun for a date, friends, or to-go! The thin-slice pizza (with any topping) is great and so is their ranch. Can't get enough."}
{"text":"This is a good pizza place. It reminds me of NYPD but not quite as salty. The prices are excellent. It's owned by an Albanian family. I only eat the cheese pizza; the meat toppings tasted a little off in the slices I tried. The listed hours are not right, I think they close at around 10 now instead of 10:30. Kind of an annoyance.   Directional note: the address is listed on Thunderbird but the business sits in a stripmall along 35th Ave, just between Burger King and Strong Bodies."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've had since I've lived in NY. Plus the men that work inside are such sweethearts to me every time I'm in! I definitely recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Solid ass place for crispy, flavorful wings and authentic New York style pizza. The ranch that comes with the wings kicks all ranch's asses of all other pizza joints around.  Currently they upgraded their TVs and my man thoroughly enjoys coming here to grub and get entertained."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! Wings were super meaty and tasted perfect. The guys who run the place always make me laugh and I love the service here."}
{"text":"The pizza is the best...hands down!  It's not the fanciest of atmosphere within their place, but the food is good, clean and reasonable.  Wings are outstanding as well."}
{"text":"I've gone to Napoli a few times in the past month and I'm still digging them...a lot! First a word on my ratings; I rate within the genre.  So when I give something four or five stars, I'm taking into consideration the type of joint I'm reviewing.  I've had slices of the thin crust cheese, sausage and meatball pizza so far and have tried the meatball and sausage calzones.  All were seriously good, with the meatball being my favorite of both.  However my wife loves the sausage (...hmm, no good way to write that one).  We've had the wings once and although there were very good, they are the reason why I didn't rate this place a five.  They were extra heavy on the vinegar, but that may have just been an anomaly so I'll be giving them another go. This place has replaced Lucky's Pizza as my go to calzone spot and just may replace my preferred wing place too.  Time will tell.  One last thing, I've read some reviews by people attesting to the fact that the owners are authentic Italian immigrants.  I hate to break it to you but despite what you've heard or even what the owners told you themselves, they're actually Albanian.  But don't let that bother you though, you don't have to be Italian to make good pie!"}
{"text":"Are you having a craving for some thin crispy crusted delicious pizza?  Well this is the place that I go to.  They have some great specials (2 slices of cheese pizza and a pop for like 5 bucks) and some great food.  I've only had the calzones and the slices of pizza here, but they have a good bit of other stuff too."}
{"text":"Just moved here from CA and we were hoping to find a pizza joint in the area  that was as awesome as some of the ones back home. Well, this place didn't disappoint! Their pizzas are HUGE. We got the sicilian and it's totally enough for 3-4 people. Crunchy on the bottom, soft in the middle, with real pepperoni on top. This place is definitely getting our return business. We can't wait to go back and try everything else! The pizza did take quite a while to get out to us, but that's just because it's fresh. And there's a small arcade!"}
