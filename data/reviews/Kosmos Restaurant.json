{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! The restaurant feels  family run, the staff is all nice and the food is great! Actually came here for a super late lunch but the portions were so filling we ended up skipping dinner. 

We ordered 3 items: eggs Benedict on steak, grilled chicken pasta, and cheese cake. 

Eggs Benedict on Steak - no complains, seriously. Eggs were poached to perfection with a warm gooey center .  I asked for the steak to be done medium rare, it had a nice brown sear on the outside and a pink in the middle, with just a little pink juice flowing and a tiny hint of red right in the middle. It looked great, wish I took a picture. All of this was topped off with a beautiful hollandaise sauce which added a nice zing to the dish. Also came with a side of potatoes.

Pasta with Grilled - Another great dish! Nice thick tomato sauce and well seasoned chicken. The sauce was cooked with a variety of vegetables that enhanced  the flavor of the dish. The pasta itself had a light texture to it, just like mama used to make. None of that 'al dente' stuff you might find at pub style restaurants. 

Vanilla Cheese Cake - This was a New York style cheese cake drizzled with caramel, it melted into your fork as you slicked into it. I actually had this with coffee which I think complimented the taste. I want to say more but at this point I was super full. 

If you are ever in the area, I seriously recommend stopping by this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great!! The portions are generous and the prices are awesome, you definitely get your money's worth. One of the best things is the extensive menu. You get quality greek food and a breakfast menu all in one so you'll definitely find something you like. The steak benedict is one of my top picks from here. Customer service here is top notch too, definitely recommend for a good and filling meal."}
{"text":"New owner very nice and breakfast we had was delicious. Prices very reasonable and service great ! We had bacon and eggs done perfectly as well as omelettes. Delicious ! Hope that others will try it out. Why line up at sunset for twice the price and be rushed out ? 
I will be going back to Kosmos every weekend for their great food and service. Check it out Newmarket :)"}
{"text":"I decided to check out this place after shopping because my friend told me it was good. I was really happy with the quality of the food and service. It was way better than what i normally get at Mr. Greek and at comparable prices. I ordered a 6oz steak on a bun with side salad and pork souvlaki.  The meat was juicy and not dry.  Staff was really friendly as well.  Overall a very good experience. I would for sure come back and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch on a weekday with a friend of mine. First impression of this place was not so good. Out of all the two person tables that were available. Only 1 table didn't have leftover food and dishes from previous customers. The server did not clean up as the guests left but rather left everything there. Service wasn't good because the food was dropped off and the server never came back until we asked for more water and also the bill. Now, there were only 1 or 2 other tables in the whole restaurant. I would think that our service would be better.

The food was your average Greek food and all day breakfast with a good selection. That's all I really have to say about this place."}
{"text":"Used to come here before the renovation and new menu, but the new menu is definitely good. Service is amazing as always, definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"K settle down with the 5 star reviews. Breakfast places suck in the GTA. I had an egg shell in my egg, the potatoes were not as they appear in the yelp pics and I've had better waffles at a holiday inn self serve breakfast. I'm half Greek, and I can say with conviction there is nothing Greek about this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing spot! Price is reasonable and food is amazing :). Owner is extremely friendly.. I would recommend everyone to come try it out!!"}
{"text":"A very nice change from normal \"chain style\" breakfasts. Kosmos is a mom and pop operation. You can tell just by the decor. I stopped in for a quick breakfast and ordered a standard eggs over easy, sausage, home fries and toast.

The eggs were cooked perfectly over easy, the sausage was juicy but the real focal point was the potatoes. Not just deep fried battered potatoes bits, these were boiled potatoes, seasoned with herbs and the gently pan fried. Delicious!

Coffee was great, service was great, I made this a more leisurely breakfast. Kosmos goes to my top three in the 'hood for breakfast, and I really need to try some lunches."}
{"text":"I decided to hubby for a late lunch and looked to Yelp for a Greek restaurant in York Region. I spotted the reviews for Kosmos and thought, great it does breakfast/brunch and Greek food.

The pictures are highly deceiving as when you first walk in it feels very cold and yet very grungy. But putting aside first impressions we sat down at one of what seemed like a million wobbly tables. Okay, still could be fine, maybe the food is awesome. 

I ordered the gyro small plate with Greek salad and roast potatoes, the hubby ordered the Kosmos burger with cheese and bacon. It took a reasonable amount of time to come out. 

Hubby's burger was very, very overdone as in they tried to cremate the cow. And the bun was also charred but they tried to cover it up with slathering on ketchup, mustard, and relish but to no avail. 

My small gyro plate very mediocre. I have had gyro at Mr. Greek and I would say it was easily comparable. Plus my \"roast\" potatoes where cold in the middle and slathered in what I assume was an attempt at lemon sauce. As well, I know I saw the cook get something from the freezer which was the potatoes, the gyro, or both. Greek salad was not memorable.

Overall, I would strongly suggest avoiding Kosmos - it is a greasy spoon without the charm."}
{"text":"Kosmos, is like going for a meal at a fine dining restaurant. The hosts are gracious and very attentive. You can have everything from delicious greek dishes to some of the best breakfast entrees in Newmarket and the prices are equivalent to your everyday diner. An absolute superb experience."}
{"text":"Found this little gem while looking for somewhere to eat and wait out the snowstorm. Service was friendly, food was delicious, portions were large and the prices were VERY reasonable. My fianc√© got the Supreme Breakfast (3 eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, pancakes, home fried and toast) and I got the Sunrise Omelette (mushroom, spinach, ham and cheese) for $9.95 each and we left happy and stuffed!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast we both ordered omelettes. It wasn't very busy when we went in so we were able to order out food have it prepared quickly. The food was great. The wait staff was friendly but definitely over worked and needed some extra help as she was the only one working. She was overwhelmed and didn't get a chance to bring coffee and forgot to bring water for my husband. They need to have another wait person or someone who can come out and help her when she is overloaded."}
{"text":"This restaurant can be found in the middle of an industrial mall in Newmarket.  The breakfast and lunch menus feature a wide selection of dishes, including the standard breakfast fare with a slant towards Greek cuisine.  

Our group ordered the chicken souvalaki in a pita, a veggie omelette and a large Greek salad with a grilled chicken breast.  The portion sizes were generous and all of us were pleased with the food.  The homefries were nice and crispy which is a bonus as I hate mushy home fries.  The salad was huge with very fresh crisp lettuce and a light Greek dressing which was not too oily with a generous but not overpowering amount of shredded feta on top.  

We tried ordered smoothies (as they were on the menu) only to be told that the restaurant doesn't serve smoothies.  We next tried to order iced coffee only to be told that it was not available.  Apart from these minor frustrations, the service was decent and the food was tasty and a good value.  We will be back."}
