{"text":"Awful! My daughter and I were served raw chicken wings.  For a party of 4 I had a $25.00 gift card and my meal was taken off the check and half of my daughter's was taken off, due to raw chicken and our bill was still $18.00.  1 soda and 3 waters.  Not good food or prices!  Will never visit again and praying we don't get sick!    $43.00 for 2-1/2 meals."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Very affordable. Fun place to go with friends and feel like your on vacation at the beach!"}
{"text":"Food was very good & you can tell made fresh. I had chicken broccoli Alfredo, very tasty & reasonably priced. Hubby had hamburger steak gravy, mashed potatoes & okra. Okra was lightly breaded, just the way I like it. We will be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and margaritas! Their food is great too and the wait staff is very personable.  We LOVED the fried pickles and will definitely be back for more.  The mac and cheese is fresh and tasty as well.  Wings were flavorful and a favorite all around.  They have entertainment at night as well.

We plan to return regularly."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant. I went with my 7 year old son to have dinner on a   beautiful sunny day, and we wanted to sit outside. I walked in to get a table, and no one was around even though the sign said \"wait to be seated\". I finally saw the owner and told him we are sitting outside and he said he would send someone out. Well we waited at least 20 minutes and no one ever came out to get our order or even acknowledge us! This restaurant states it's a \"family restaurant\" but it's all crap. The only people that were there were bikers, who are obviously the customers that get all the attention. I used to frequently go to Tumbleweeds (the restaurant before this one) and always got awesome service and awesome food. I miss them terribly. I have been here, at The Parrot before, and the food wasn't even that good. The service was better than on this day, but after getting this treatment and knowing the food is pretty bad, I will never go back again. Thank Goodness Buffalo Wild Wings moved in to Monroe! We went to Wild Wings and my son saw the difference between GREAT service and POOR service. You lost out Lost Parrot. And I will make sure my friends don't waste their time with this Lost restaurant."}
{"text":"super fun! The decor was fun, and there was covered, outdoor seating. The menu had a good variety. The food was good. Kendra, our waitress, was very friendly and gave us great service and suggestions. The drinks and the food were very reasonably priced. Had a great time. I would recommend The Lost Parrot to anyone.... locals or just passing through."}
{"text":"Outstanding wait staff! Friendly, attentive & fast. 

The fish & chips are great though I was surprised to see the \"chips\" were actual homemade crisp in lieu of French fries, but they very good & not remotely greasy at all. The fish was home fried not frozen and very light, flaky and melt in your mouth good. 

The honey garlic wings are yummy and out do any chain restaurant any day."}
{"text":"Great food and the owner is great. The wings are a definite must have as well as the burgers. Good food for a good price."}
{"text":"Terrible...disgusting.....food was cold,  raw fish....chicken fingers are cooked in same oil as fish so guess what???? 3 others in the restraunt and the service sucked....."}
{"text":"What a fun place. They opened up the area you no longer feel like your in a dingy bar. Staff is fun and knowledgeable. Was able to assist us in our choices. Wings were great along with the fresh pork rinds. We felt like we could splurge and still enjoy the appetizers. 
Next visit we are going to start at the top of the menu and work our way down.
And yes.. Kendra is all that....."}
{"text":"After reading the rave reviews, we were really looking forward to trying The Lost Parrot and very disappointed to find a notice from the Union County Sheriff's Office advising that wasn't gonna happen."}
