{"text":"Loved the thali..For the price it was good !! THeir paneer dish and Naan were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious goodness! I've read previous reviews regarding getting the Thali dish... Have been sending my husband to get the take out Thali dish any chance I get the cravings for an explosion of flavours. Everything is fresh...and very tasty...my sons who are picky eaters have enjoyed the variety of selections included in the dish...will be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Great Indian thali. Everything is fresh and home-made like. No complaints. Try their Carrot pickle. All curd items are great. Me and my wife loved it."}
{"text":"Love there food. Amazing taste. Good service.  Would eat here again, decor is  a bit dated."}
{"text":"I bought an order of ras malai this evening and the milk was sour. Only 2 of the 6 ras malai were firm, the rest were disintegrating and soggy."}
{"text":"I ordered Veg Biriyani and it was terrible. It had only onions and a few cubes of capsicum in the name of 'Veg Biriyani'.  No other vegetable and the quantity offered was also less as compared to other restaurants.  Would never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Just came back and was disappointed. This is my go-to Indian food place but the food was cold this time and I found a tiny hair in my mango drink. So upset about this."}
{"text":"I had their channa patooray and it was not good. The channa were quite el-dente and taste like it was just cooked in tomato sauce with no flavour at all and the patooray were really oily."}
