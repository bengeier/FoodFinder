{"text":"I love this place. Nice selection of craft beers,  late night food,  solid To Go set up.   The service has never been fantastic but I love the atmosphere and the GOURMET Asian food.   I love people watching at this place and love stopping in for a beer.   This will always be my first TO GO option on  the way home"}
{"text":"First time and it's very delicious the service is nice and the overall theme reminds me of the old days"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS. This place is dope. It's a hole in the wall, a real dive bar with AMAZING food. Chloe was my server, and she was wonderful. We had their pot sticker app, which was crispy and delicious and served with soy sauce with chopped scallions in the sauce. I ordered Chicken Lo Mein, which was great, but I would order of without celery next time. Boyfriend had the Garlic Chicken Rice Bowl and he said it was very good. Huge portions which is nice for reheating."}
{"text":"One of the worst places I've been. The server was completely clueless and when I asked for a manager she replied there might be a floor manager here. I asked her to send over the manager and the manager never came. It seems this place and its management is only interested in people sitting at the bar and not asking questions.  I would not recommend this place for anything."}
{"text":"The WORST tasting Chinese food ever! Not edible. They should be closing their business to save the lives of many!!! We had to add sauce and sriracha to try to even make it edible and even that didn't help...well maybe...by 1%!!! The chow main was so bland...parts of the noodles over cooked...others under cook. The fried rice was pathetic. Garlic shrimp was blah except for the actual shrimp. Won ton was a 3/10 and that was their best dish! The wonton wrap was too thick. The meat inside, dry. I wouldn't ever order Chinese food from here. If they were giving it out there for free I wouldn't even take it. It was that bad!!!    The only good thing was.... It tasted soooooo horrible that we didn't stuff ourselves. Lol."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town!  A different kind of place but well worth the visit.  Great they have all the ball games."}
{"text":"What a joke!!!  This place looks very deceiving from the outside. That is what lured me there. Outside it looks like a authentic Chinese restaurant, inside it looks like a rock band studio. The whole atmosphere was directed towards the bar. I thought I was going to eat at a restaurant  not a lame wana be pub. The food was lousy. Take my advice and don't come here to eat. you have been warned !!!!"}
{"text":"Alright.... If you love a good dive bar, and a dive bar with AMAZING chinese food, then this is your place! The jukebox is a huge hit here with people literally qeueing the song list for over 2 hours. It's a fun place with live music on occasion and a very friendly staff. They serve food until 2 am, something not found very often. Overall, this place is unique and is a great experience."}
{"text":"Awesome new location! I was in for UFC and was happy to see plenty of people and enough seating for everyone TVs clearly visible and staff on top of their game. Great beer selection and highly knowledgable staff. I wasn't sure which beer to try the server and bartender helped me find a few new beers that I've never had. Solid IPA selection which was perfect for my friend. This is definitely a place I will come back to either for a night out drinking or lunch with my folks. Super comfortable and great food. Lo mien hit the spot and the jalapeño puffs were awesome!  Super fun and friendly environment, good looking staff (big plus), awesome food, and holy crap food available until 2AM!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't get to try the food! Tried to order food for take out but the person taking the order was so rude and grouchy ended up canceling our order! What a shame! If you want business at least act like it! Very bad service!"}
{"text":"I ordered some takeout and was overcharged.  Instead of being credited, I was charged for the same item again, something that I did not realize until I checked the receipt later.  I ended up overpaying by $15. The takeout area was dark and no one was there for 10 minutes - I had to go to the kitchen door to get help.  That should have been a big clue as to the service.    If the food had been even average, that would have made it better.  However, the food was horrible. Wonton soup ($7 for less than a pint) overloaded with iceberg lettuce and 2 mushrooms. Over cooked wontons that disintegrated and must have been cooking all day.  Hard and inedible rice.  Over cooked vegetables.  Truly a \"kitchen nightmare.\" Bad food, bad service, and overcharged."}
{"text":"if you want a place where the staff talks shit about you to all the other employees and customers, come here!  Or if you want to sit yourself at a table (as directed) and wait 5 or minutes for a server, come here! service at tables is beyond slow and completely terrible.  servers (and bartenders) have no knowledge of draft beers, or even what they have.  I get that there is a lot of beers on tap and the taps change, which is cool, but when I ask about a unique beer or a specific type on draft, I expect an answer besides \"I don't know\".  I wanted to love this spot for its dive bar feel, selection of draft beer, and food served till 2 AM, but the service and management make it really hard to like.  specifically Michelle, goes out of her way to avoid you, if she doesn't like you, which would be fine if she didn't tell her coworkers and other customers how much she hates you, which all of them will gladly remind you of.  Her unprofessionalism of bringing up past (4 or 5 years ago) issues dampers the atmosphere and adds and high school drama feel to the whole place.  And don't bother talking to management, regardless of her unprofessionalism, poor judgment, poor service, and flat out rudeness the owner will take her side, even though he is losing major money in his pocket!  regardless of a \"past history\" with Michelle or not, I can guarantee that you will have poor service, overpriced beers, and an uncomfortable atmosphere.  I will never be back to this establishment and would much rather take my business to another local business with professional servers, timely service, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Haven't had to many expat Chinese food places here in AZ but your food fit perfectly. Very good. It was delivery so i couldn't get a feel for your place, but your drivers were nice. Food was great, I ordered the fried rice, And orange chicken combo plate. And was speedy as well."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in for lunch after driving past this place a billion times....really weird inside.  I mean in a lot of ways just your typical, divey bar.  Super \"eclectic\" décor.... bright colors, pish posh of all kinds of different stuff on the walls and ceiling.  Just odd.  Also loud metal music was playing... no biggie, just a casual type bar.    I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken.  Asked for extra vegetables.  When I got the plate, it just did NOT look appetizing.  They say you eat with your eyes first. LOL .  But I dug in cause I was hungry.  The sauce was very thick, there was a LOT of it, and it didn't appear that they put extra veggies like I asked.  Just looked like a normal portion.  There is what I thought to be a TON of garlic in the sauce.  Did not find that appealing.  Taste wise, it was just ALRIGHT... I didn't really care for it.  I would not recommend this place for their food that's for sure.  BUT... apparently they have live music and I would probably come back for that and a couple drinks one night.  That's about it though!"}
{"text":"IT'S BACK!!! Like the namesake of the metropolitan area we live in, the kitschy cool of the longtime Scottsdale favorite \"WokStar Bar / Chop and Wok\" has risen from the ashes (literally) in a new location...  (Xiètianxièdì) !  Please ignore anything Babette has said of this place (and any other), as by a quick look of her distribution of \"star reviews\" anyone can see she is an a seemingly angry woman and is one of those people who is high-maintenance and hard to please...  Are they trying to be P.F. Chang's? Oh please... Ask the owner, he has no problem telling anyone and everyone who comes in that it's a casual \"dive bar\" - Oh yeah, that's what the diving board is there for, get it? Dive Bar? It's great fun, really good food- which you can get full menu until 2am seven days a week- HELLO!  This was my first visit back since they moved and reopened, and I am suitably impressed. The staff was super attentive, the food was quick, hot, and very tasty... not to mention, just as ordered... I take the time to sit down and review places usually only when they've impressed me in some way. Chop and Wok, I'll be back- again and again!  ** Note: Almost forgot... cool too that they have handheld credit card machines they bring to the table- no waiting for the server to come back or even leave with your card at all!    *** By the way, Michelle M. of Yelp had this to say too:  (Five Stars) Yes and Heck Yes!!!! They're back! I had withdraws since the old location closed a couple years ago. Same quick great food and kooky atmosphere! The prices are great. This is a great place for a quick and cheap lunch. I'm so happy they kept the same vibe as before. By the way not biker at all, more artsy and fun, come as you are. Great for people watching. Never judge a book by it's cover, right?! Will absolutely be coming back! Have fun at this place, good food, good fun, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Ordered here twice because no one is open after 10 pm on a weekday and they deliver. Both times, the food was okay, good but not great and both times, the delivery person was incredibly creepy. The food was luke-warm and the orange chicken was mushy and dense. The only thing I'd recommend is the wonton soup, that was actually really good."}
{"text":"In the big scheme of things this is just fine food. The joint is a bit scary but the ribs are good and the portions are big. The hot mustard is just packets so not good. The server was not very attentive. Overall just ok."}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese food in AZ! Great place to grab a beer and watch a game. They deliver too! Fun vibe and good food."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for first time. Food was not good at all. The fried rice was not fried rice. It tasted like steamed rice \"colored\" with soy sauce. Fake food."}
{"text":"What a great concept,  craft brew with rice and stuff.  Check out trap hunter for the daily selection of beer's.  The menu is full of fresh vegetables, meats and the sauces are spot on. If you are close you can't go wrong dropping in to check out this one of a kind Chinese brew house. It is closer to a 5 but everybody seems to have very personal opinions about Chinese food so it's hard to rate any restaurant in this category over a 4. Let me know what you think?"}
{"text":"Worst Chinese ive ever had! I couldn't finish 2 bites of the crispy (not crispy)  honey chicken."}
{"text":"The food portions were small and tasted like they came from Costcos frozen section. Also the orange chicken basically tasted like McDonald's chicken nuggets slathered in artificially flavored orange sauce. The doors of the kitchen were wide open, allowing us to peek inside. What we saw was anything but meeting the health inspection standards. The cooks did not wear hair nets, let alone tie back their hair. Futhermore, there were small flying insects flying around our table which we had to constantly shoo away. The decor is not something you would see in a typical chinese restaurant  but a 1900s retro movie. Except for the occasional lanterns hanging from the ceiling and the cheap plastic plates nailed to the wall. Overall, I do not see myself coming back to this place any time soon and fail to see how this place stayed open for almost three decades."}
{"text":"The food sucks.  Who puts Chinese food in a curry sauce!?!!?!!  It's obviously a chef with his head up some where.  I'm pist off cuz we paid over 70.00 for food we had delivered and threw in the trash.  The food is grotesque."}
{"text":"YUCK!  Everything tasted like it had been sitting in a warming pan all day.  Not seasoned right and NOT fresh.  The KUNG PAO BEEF was mushy and the peanuts were soft.  The FRIED WONTONS were as hard as a rock and the meat inside was dry and had no flavor.  Don't try to use a GROUPON for a to go order either.  They gave me a hard time about it even though there was no indication on the Groupon website that it could only be used for dine in.  This was my first time eating at Chop and Wok and I only tried it because of the Groupon.    I won't be going back.  FLO's is so much better and fresh!"}
{"text":"Food is ok- I've had better. Everything was pretty bland. We ordered chicken fried rice, sweet n sour chicken(soggy and very bland) chicken chow mein and beef and broccoli. For $50 I wouldn't order this again."}
{"text":"I am so glad to find a place that has outstanding Asian food! I have yet to find anything I dont like on their menu. This place delivers til midnight and serves their full menu til 2am! Amazing! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went here as an out-of-towner with some local friends. First and foremost, the service was amazing. Trevor was perfect; offering suggestions on beers and food that he thought we would truly enjoy. You felt like he really cared enough to ensure we enjoyed our selections and the overall experience.    Based on his recommendation, I tried the DanDan (sp?) which was a chicken dish with lo-mein noodles and those weird chop suey white noodles on the side.  Additionally, there was a side of sautéed zucchini that worked so well with the rest of the dish.   Let's not forget the 30 beers on tap from some of the most well-respected breweries from around the country. The list of beers was impressive.  Great job!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and drink prices. Plus Jamie and Katie are great bartenders. Come in and ask for them"}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, but they have an open mic so... Chop and Wok is better than China? (because china is mean or hates jesus or something?)  So hide the meth?.... thats what it felt like. Really fun."}
{"text":"An old FAV! Great food and service. Huge selection on tap with great suggestions from knowledgeable staff.  Great to see the place packed to the brim tonight!"}
{"text":"This is a bar that serves Chinese food....or at least tries to serve Chinese food.  The staff is nice, the ambiance is like a bar in Tampa.  But the food...OMG.  I should have gone to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"This place rocks....great drinks fun staff!!!! I come in a couple days a week with my boyfriend....great place to unwind"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and yummy! So glad I finally found some fresh and tasty Chinese food. I ordered fried rice cooked exactly as I asked and it was so tasty it didn't even need soy sauce. The egg rolls had good flavor but didn't travel well as they were soggy in the middle. Overall I will definitely be a repeat customer. Give them a try."}
{"text":"I ordered LARGE beef-snow peas for pick up last night. I should have taken a look at what's in the bag right at Chop Wok. When I got home and opened the bag, there were two SMALL boxes, one of which is entirely white rice! I was not told that it comes with rice? I'd expect both boxes to make a LARGE dish i order! The food doesn't taste good, too salty. The amount is way toooooooooo tiny for $12! It's no more than 10 pieces of beef. I'm so glad it's only 12 bucks I spent and that's it for the rest of my life, never come back!"}
{"text":"Chop and Horrible  I didn't want to because the food was so terrible the last time I ordered it, but my wife only wanted Chinese and this is the only place open late. Well, it was a big mistake again. We ordered a chicken dish but there was no chicken - only soggy vegetables (just like last time). We ordered pork and we got another box full soggy vegetables. No pork.   Even worse than cheating us on the protein, there is NO flavor in this food.  It all tastes watered down. It all tastes like nothing. Its not an easy thing to do to make Chinese food bland, but somehow Chop and Wok does it.  We've had six dishes now and each has been a waste of money. Even though it is the only Chinese open late, I will never go back. This is really terrible food. Honestly, you will not get good food here - $10 for a box of trash. That's annoying.  Chop and Walk somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Have gone to chop n wok a number of times. I have purchased groupon probably 25 times if not more. Jaime the owner is great but when he is not there the place goes to crap. I will never return although the food was great as usual the service sucks waitresses and bartenders are so rude and unfriendly. Never again !"}
{"text":"We had great service and great food.. full service bar, we ordered a Bloody Mary and Margarita which was made fresh for both of us.. we would definitely come again"}
{"text":"Amateur Hour. Waited for our delivery for three hours.  Original order (obviously automated) went to our work address not home, even though specifically gave new address with instructions. Called in shift leader was nice enough, comped food.   However, after we had to reorder, the second time food was still sitting in kitchen 80 min later. Called in, was on hold for 10 minutes.  Bottom line is delivery is shoddy and unreliable. Mostly because they automate and don't  follow up.  3rd time around got here quickly. 2 stars for that. It's still decent food."}
{"text":"Chop and wok somehow combines the Full bar, open mic, surferish, chinesish vibe. A bit of an identity crisis, ironically like most people and places in Scottsdale, but they make it work.   The place was clean, the customer service was good, the food wasnt bad.   I had the Mongolian beef with white rice. Total $8.65 before tip.  Nothing to write home about, but I would come back."}
{"text":"I'm from a small town and love the small town feel, good music selection for Snobsdale. I can't help where I live but I can choose to go to a bar and restaurant that has down to earth feel. 31 beers on tap. My favorites border between Lumberjack Red and Mission Shipwrecked. I haven't tried the food yet, but that doesn't even matter! Anytime I can sit and enjoy a beer with a well educated bartender (who knows the difference between an amber and a stout, hard to find in most bars surprisingly) and listen to sublime, queen, oldies rock, system of a down and 90s rap then I'm game. Your food could be made of horse shit. I'd still come here every weekend for dope people and a NORMAL people vibe. Such a nice escape from the sea of snobs I've encountered since moving here. I recommend this place if your nose isn't stuck in the air. Keep doin what you're doin, chop and wok. It's worked for the last TWENTY SEVEN years!!! :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Chop and Wok.  Great drinks, awesome food and such a cool laid back atmosphere.  My favorites are the Kung Pao chicken, crab and jalapeno puffs, and chow mein.  The veggies in every dish are so fresh.  Great neighborhood place to hang out!"}
{"text":"I finally found a great Chinese place! so yummy. jalapeño puffs, chicken fried rice and pot stickers were delicious. I will recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and good customer service. Four stars instead of Five because I never stick around in there long if I don't need to. Bizarre atmosphere and loud music, strange kind of biker bar feel to it.  Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves but it's just not my scene and I usually have my kiddos with me. Not family friendly in that sense. So, as I have been doing for several years, I order the food on the way home, do a quick pick up then eat to my hearts content. My kids love their Orange Chicken, Chicken Lo Mein and pot stickers. Hubby and I love the crab puffs and Kiwi Strawberry Chicken and Moo Shu Pork.  Egg Rolls and House Fried Rice are good as well.  I would recommend food but nothing else."}
{"text":"It's a bar that does Chinese food on the side.  Panda express has better food.  The good thing is that its open till 2am."}
{"text":"Ordered a delivery to my hotel one night... 1.5 hours later it still wasn't there. Called to see what was up and they acted like I was the one inconveniencing them. It ended up taking about 2.5 hours to get to a hotel less than 10 minutes away. The food seems like it would have been ok if it hadn't been cooked two hours earlier so maybe dining in is the move. I don't plan to find out, though."}
{"text":"Too me its the best in scottsdale. The price is right, hours are great espically for a person who does over night work like me... delivery is good. Can you fins better yes if you want to pay much more, or go to places like NY. However you still will not get the atmosphere and the great service."}
{"text":"Not what you'd expect-thumbs up! So if you want a fun traditional ny food Chinese food experience that tastes good with a fun atmosphere.....this is the place. Sat in a booth with three 12 year olds and orders lo mein, orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, beef and broccoli but my favorite are the crab puffs which I also ordered to go."}
{"text":"We came for a late night snack and were welcomed by a very friendly attentive waitress. Jaime, the owner, came by to introduce himself and made sure we had everything we needed. We received good food and great service, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what this place is supposed to be...dive bar or Chinese restaurant!  It succeeded in being a  raunchy dive bar when my sister and I visited last Monday for lunch.  Soon after we were seated,  four loud obnoxious drunks began yelling at one another in the bar area and there was no getting away from them, although we moved to a different table. We really didn't give a darn about their sex lives and we certainly didn't want to hear about them...but we had no choice.  UGH!   Our server was very good...I felt sorry for her.  We had the crab wontons appetizer, which she recommended, but were just so so.     My sister asked if the fried  shrimp came with any veggies and the server recommended she get some steamed veggies...we assumed (wrongly) that the veggies were a side dish.  I was so put off by the loud drunks that I told my sister I really didn't want to stay.  No sooner had we gotten up than my sisters food arrived (Like 5 minutes.)  We told the person who brought the food, not our server, that we were leaving and headed to the front of the restaurant where the cash register was.  Our server was there and we explained that the drunks were just too loud and we wanted to leave.  She gave us the check which was for $27.00!!  Remember, I had ordered nothing but the won tons and we were drinking iced tea! My sister had been charged for two lunch  'specials' at $7.99. To their credit, the manager made the bill right and we ended up taking the food home. It was OK, but not great by any means.  This place is dark and the tables are sticky.  Some of the other reviewers  may like the funky atmosphere, but we hated it...and will not be back!  The bar area needs to be separated from the dining area.  This is certainly no place for children!"}
{"text":"Stacy is awesome great food great service love this place i would recommend to all my friends and family.."}
{"text":"I have no clue where to start. The food is actually decent as long as you don't have it delivered. We've tried delivery on two occasions and both times, the food is mushy by the time it's to your house. The second time we actually asked that they not include the sauces so that we could add them. Didn't make much of a difference.  Now we've eaten in a couple of times and the food it again, decent but the atmosphere definitely leaves quite a bit to be desired while my GF actually likes the atmosphere.  The other thing is that cleanliness doesn't seem to be a high priority with the staff because the tables and bottles on the tables have been dirty of both of the occasions that we've eaten in.  The staff has always been extremely friendly and the time when we called in regarding our delivery order they were understanding and actually sent out another order.  I just think there's so much potential with it because of the food, cost (affordable) and portion size, not to mention the location. They just need to work on the cleanliness and turn on the AC in the summer!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, haven't been to this new location for Chop and Wok (used to leave nearby and visited the old location frequently)...How fun!  And, the food was good.  Tried the curry veggies, fried rice/veggie and the veggie lo mein.  All where prepared with very good flavors, sizeable portions (for sharing); and, quick/courteous and fast service.  Glad we went there and will definitely return."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason I'm giving Chop and Wok one star is because I have to. Which is truly a shame because the food is wonderful but the customer service, GARBAGE. First, when we called to place the order we were put on hold more than once. While we did have someone on the phone, the lady was laughing at us and chatting with a friend/coworker at the same time. After requesting no mushrooms or onions on the entire order, it was delivered with mushrooms and onions on everything. When we called to make a complaint, \"your mom\" argued that we were wrong, stating \"we need to be more specific next time\". That's right, when we asked for her name her response was, \"your mom\". After listening to her tell us how WE placed the order incorrectly, we asked for her name again and she hung up on us. Calling back, she would answer and hang up even if from a different number.  The help here is going to ruin this restaurant. I will not be ordering from them again unless this gets resolved."}
{"text":"I placed a couple to go orders and found out that they had a new special price on their free crab puffs.   Instead of being $15 as advertised on their old menu, it's now $20 on their new menu.  The manager was extremely cool and still offered the $15 price since it appeared on their online menu.     Happy customer, happy tummies.  Next time I want to dine in.  LIke others have said, the ambiance is kind of retro California surf.  Great vibe.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"After trying to be optimistic about this place, I found other negative reviews to be accurate after trying Chop and Wok. Dirty table, bland tasting orange chicken (had better at Panda Express), beer that was dark at the bottom, and the waitress taking my phone to use the groupon were just some of the issues I had. Save yourself the trouble and go to a place that isn't a bar that serves bland/gross Chinese."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of chop and wok. It was my first time in the new location and I have to say they have it going on. Great selection of beers and tons of TV's all around. Not sure if they have a happy hour but it was a bit pricey for drinks and chinese food."}
{"text":"This place was really disappointing. I went with a friend who loves the place. The crab puffs were fine but nothing special. The egg rolls were actually greasy, mushy spring rolls. And the Mongolian chicken had little flavor. The staff and service were nice and attentive, but the food failed. They do have a great beer selection. Go for drinks but find another place to eat."}
{"text":"I was lured in one early Saturday morning by a guy waving a sign advertising a bacon & egg breakfast special on the corner of Scottsdale & Shea.  Whats a hungry girl to do? I see the word bacon, and I come running.  I was pretty surprised that they were open so early in the morning, so I went on in to check it out. What I found was a super cool bar with crazy decorations and colors and pretty damn good food too, at very reasonable prices. I was told their chicken fried steak is a must try, so I'll have to get that next time. The bartender and cook were very friendly. Also came back one night for drinks with a girlfriend and once again had a very cool bartender, and we opted for some asian dishes which weren't bad at all. Really cool place for drinks with friends, will come back for sure.   Tip- this place opens up like at 7am on weekends!"}
{"text":"Before I stepped inside this place, the vibe was welcoming. Music, the smiles I got from the people who work there...all we're inviting and gave me an appetite to indulge. I ordered the orange chicken vegetable fried rice and honey crispy shrimp. All were a splendid joy in my belly. Each dish were tasty and fresh. Nothing in my to go meal bag tasted frozen.   I'll be here either company again and to eat in. Jamie the bartender was cool holding a very nice presence behind the bar."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dive bars! I love the bartender Erin and Shane is cool too. The food is good and the beer selection is always great! I've always had nice experiences here and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"First time here. Good food. Generous portions. Am fantastic waitstaff! Our server was Shea (not sure if spelling) and she was very sweet and patient. Quick service. Only complaint was the place was too toasty. Downright hot in there. Overall good. More bar than a restaurant."}
{"text":"Very average Chinese food heavily sauced with corn syrup and corn starch. Don't let the name fool you into thinking this is fresh steamed healthy Chinese. Their bland little egg rolls are the size of spring rolls. And btw, there is absolutely NOTHING \"punk rock\" about the decor. It's more like a typical sports bar with some third rate mainstream Hard Rock Cafe type memorabilia on the walls. And they don't play punk rock music either."}
{"text":"This place was strange, a Chinese/Asian restaurant with no  Asian staff with surfer theme decorations?  The food was just ok at best.  There was an open mic in the next room but nobody was laughing."}
{"text":"We ordered four different dishes and all but the generals chicken looked exactly the same in a soup of brown sauce. The chow mein, beef with broccoli, and garlic shrimp looked and tasted exactly the same.   We ordered a large order of all and the sizes were much smaller than expected.   We won't be back."}
{"text":"Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but these people do not care whether you're satisfied or not. Ownership to the bartender. Since they joined Grub Hub I ordered from here at least twice per week. Food is very basic, decent, nothing to write home about, it was all about convenience. Checked my receipts from 2015, spent over $2100. Yes, I was a regular. Never had to deal with these people until my last order that they clearly got wrong. It's always the same order through GH, for those of you who are familiar with placing a 'Past Order\". 2 clicks, done! Well, they messed up and the bartender who answered the phone only wanted to make sure I knew it was ME that messed up. She had zero interest in solving the problem. Insisted I made a mistake with my order, over and over again. Refused to take any accountability and just do the right thing. Regardless of if I'm a regular or not. It's just the right thing to do for your customers. Well, this made me angry since she could not understand how GH worked and continued to blame me for the mistake. Side note...the difference was $2! Let me say that again...TWO DOLLARS!!!!! So, giving up on my anger, she handed off the phone to her manager who immediately took her employee's side and berated me for speaking to her employee that way. Excuse me, wouldn't you be interested to know how it got to that point? Nothing? Hard to blame the employee when the Manager is so completely incompetent. Before I started to write this review I thought I'd give the owner a call first, just to see if this issue stops with the management. Wanted to be fair to a local business owner before levying my social media assault. (This is just the beginning) Well, low and behold...this guy (Stacey?) also had zero interest in making things right. Caught him in the middle of something, said he would call me back...never did. So...they just lost a $2100 per year customer over $2 and a whole lot of unwarranted pride. Worst thing is, I brought the incorrect order back to the restaurant to get a refund and even with me standing right there, with a perfect opportunity to make things right (over $2), they did nothing....said nothing. I had to find the number to Grub Hub for them. Sad that Stacey has no idea how many people I know and how much of a financial impact I can make on his business with just my mouth. I guarantee this place will see at least a 15% loss year over for 2016. Check your books Stacey. It'll be a good lesson for you. Also, I have both conversations recorded for anyone who would be interested in hearing how bad it actually is. You're welcome to it as well Stacey."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I've been eating at chop n wok since 1998 when it was in the original location. Best food! Great and friendly staff. Plus, they have a great comedy open mic and Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"The 5-stars are for the food, the willingness to modify/cook a dish the way you may be used to it or would like to try it, and the staff!  We stopped in early Saturday afternoon based on the reviews.  We almost left simply because the appearance and darkness of this neighborhood bar just did not mesh with a place that could have such great food.  We didn't leave because, well, we are tavern folks.  We are more at home in a place where you know, even as strangers, they will make you feel at home.  We have never been able to find a good place in Snobsdale - relax, we live here - for good Chinese food until now.  Outstanding.  Before we ordered we asked questions such as can we get white chicken in this, could we sample this before ordering - kind of what some places might call difficult customers.  But here it was not only YES, but let us bring you out a bite to try if there is some ready, including sauces.  The food was VERY good and there was plenty of it!  You can easily share a dish or dishes as a couple.  It's definitely the place to come for Asian food or just drinks.  Well done Chop & Wok.  We will be back and we will tell others."}
{"text":"This is not a Chinese restaurant, but rather a loud middle-aged bar that happens to serve Chinese food. Food was mediocre, service was lousy and it is not the right venue for the percussion-heavy live music they provide."}
{"text":"1st time in, food was good, service was fine...but the place is disgustingly dirty, menu was like 10 years old, bar was sticky....IDK, may be back for another try but I usually like to not stick to everything I touch..."}
{"text":"Why is it that my frugality makes me buy online coupons that are offered to me?  I do it ALL the time--- rather successfully I might add.  It not only saves me money but introduces me to new restaurants and cuisines.  So here we go on the merry go round of Local Dines coupons---$25 worth of food for $12.50 plus a fee that Local Dines charges.  How could I go wrong with half price food.  Need you ask?  Don't you know where this is going?   An eclectic place to say the least---you really don't know what it is... mexican color decor, pool table, darts,  large bar, wall murals, interesting signage, tv's with sports on... it's a little bit of everything decor wise, but DEFINITELY NOT CHINESE- food wise.   Ordered the beef chow mein which came with \"sautéed\" noodles with beef, vegetables and a sauce on top.  Looked like Chinese food but when I tasted it I would not describe it as Chinese.  No asians flavors, no ginger, no soy sauce, no sesame oil---picture store-bought gravy dissolved with some chicken stock( maybe) or water with corn starch added and poured over the noodles & the beef.  If I closed my eyes, I would not have been able to discern that this beef was actually beef.  THERE WERE NO ASIAN FLAVORS TO SPEAK OF IN THIS DISH.  When the waitress came by and asked about the food, I told her how I felt about the food.  She (Kloe) graciously offered to give me something else.  How nice of her!  (That is the reason for one of the stars above.) I took another chance with Beef with Peanut sauce.  In the meantime, hubby was eating his orange chicken made without the breading.  He liked it because it was spicy enough but he too thought the \"chicken\" was weird tasting.  Give him spice and he's alright.  How mundane.  How trite.  Spiciness does not make a dish taste good.  It can only enhance it if it's good already.  DO I HEAR AN 'AMEN\"?   So I get the beef with peanut sauce and all I can say is that at least it reminded me of something asian--thai peanut sauce although not as good.  She gave me plenty of white rice with it which I did not eat.  \"Vacuum-cleaner hubby\" helped me finish my plate.   My mother taught me to always say something nice and here it goes.  They have an amazing array of all types of beers--some brands I never even heard of.  I had an Abita which was lemony and on special  (yay! yay! another bargain!!! $2.75).  Hubby had the stout which was served in a small brandy glass and he got charged $6.50-- not a full brandy glass either.  Can't win.   Here's what I found out about this restaurant:  One of the owners is Hawaiian (that makes him somewhat Asian);  The chef is Chinese from Portugal (that's semi-asian in my book), there are white cooks and mexican cooks in the kitchen.  Nice diversity BUT I WANT MY CHINESE FOOD COOKED BY CHINESE CHEFS... DOES EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THAT????????? I WANT IT TO TASTE LIKE CHINESE FOOD!  I want it to be delicious, I want ginger in it, I want that subtle taste of sesame oil, I want some soy sauce, I want some hot chinese mustard,  I want it, I want it, I want to eat good chinese food!!!!   Unfortunately THIS IS NOT IT.  Don't even think it.   Here's what it is. It is a bar with a cool vibe decor-wise.  It has amazing beers.  The servers are nice--at least Kloe was.  They have multiple televisions to watch what you want.  Come in to this place, have some beers maybe some egg rolls (can they screw those up too???) and then go to a real chinese restaurant if you want Chinese food.  Chop & Wok,  why don't you serve some delicious sliders?  Those are more up your alley."}
{"text":"Great Tap List! Poor Service  We went on a weekday night, so not exactly in the middle of peak time. The tap list is probably the best on Scottsdale and Shea! However if you actually want to eat, or get a second beer you're probably going to have to wait a while. When food finally does arrive, don't expect anyone to come back to your side of the bar for follow-up (we were literally sitting at the bar!!!). So... If you're just going there to have a few beers or pick up take-out (the food is pretty good), this is a good spot. If on the other hand you plan on eating there, bring your patience and drink another beer. :)  -Rich"}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant.  Never seen a Chinese restaurant that offers full bar menu.  Concept was new and good but the food wasn't really all that impressive.  Being Asian myself, my review is a bit bias.  But I don't mind trying new places.  Give it a try yourself and decide if you like it or not."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Chinese food for miles. Oh wait... It's a bar? With over 30 beers on tap and an awesome kitchen, where else would you want to go to watch the game, fight, race? Chop and Wok is that place where you could hang out, take your significant other on a date or just grab a cold one after work. They deliver to ungodly hours, open the doors super early on Sunday's for the hangover crowd and serve these awesome bloody Mary's. Try the house fried rice. Less than a meal at any fast food place and there is a lot of it. Expect a Surf punk California motif and the feeling you should've tried this place long ago."}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered food for delivery and did not receive it until 2 hours later!!! We even called multiple times and the workers seemed confused as to why the food had not been delivered... Not to mention once we got the food it was less than average!"}
{"text":"The best Asian food ever! We sat at the bar while we waited for our food- awesome bar!! The chicken and mushroom was delicious- huge pieces of chicken in a delicious sauce, and the fried rice was outstanding!! Will definitely be back- I live within walking distance so this is a for sure thing for me! Husband got the beef and black beans- vey fresh and not pre made!! Very happy!!"}
{"text":"the owner closed the doors, and never paid his employees their final check. Smh. Hopefully his next adventure in business burns to the floor."}
{"text":"\"Identity crisis\" comes to mind.  Went in expecting chinese food.  Was not expecting a divey sports bar with wrestling on all tv's.  Definitely would not have taken my 80+ year old Mom here.  The food was mediocre.  The waiter was awesome.  So, if you want to go to a chaotic dive bar with chinese food, here's your place - it's just an odd combination."}
{"text":"Not for everyone, I think that I can say that without anyone disagreeing. If you don't like punk and metal music or the idea of a beach bar/music club that serves Chinese food then you're probably not the type of person that enjoys unique experiences, and that's ok. I'll break this review up in 2 ways so that it represents each of the areas that Chop & Wok offer.  As a Bar: When I explain Chop & Wok to people, I typically get strange looks. When I get them in the door for after work drinks, it quickly becomes EVERYONE's go to spot. A fantastic beer selection, a great set up for socializing. Attentive bartenders including Jamie the owner who after the original burnt down, didn't see me for over 2 years, but remembered my drink order and name the minute I walked through the door of the new location. Try the Orange Sunshine shot, it's tasty and a great shot for groups without pressing people to take shots they may dislike.  As a Restaurant: The chinese food is some of the best in Scottsdale, I've never had a dish that I didn't enjoy. The crisp honey shrimp is great, my favorite though is the Dan Dan Noodles extra spicy. The panang lo mein is also excellent and you have to get the jalapeno puffs. If you eat in, expect music and carrying on from bar patrons, if you get takeout or delivery, you likely won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I will never Order from this place ever again! I ordered tofu with broccoli and noodle bowl with teriyaki chicken which were disgusting.  I had this delivered to the villa and paid $24 plus $6 tip; didn't mind spending $30 but the food was so disgusting i ended up throwing it out. They deliver until 2AM which is great but you will be extremely happy waking up to traditional continental breakfast."}
{"text":"They were great about checking on info for our allergies.  Service was friendly.  Food was great.  Beer was cold!  :)  I hadn't yet been to this newer location after the old location closed.  But, I am happy to say that I like this revived version even more.  Good food, beer and played some pool and Connect Four with our son (no beer for our son :) )."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking to stumble on a new place to eat and we were going to settle for oreganos next door since most places were closed on Sunday, but then we saw this place and had high hopes. We got the jalapeño puffs which were good, a fried wonton with jalapeño, can't go wrong. And they weren't greasy! We thought the rest of the meal wasn't so pleasant. We got vegetable lo mein, broccoli and oyster sauce, and kung pao shrimp. The lo mein was greasy, it looked like spaghetti, and the vegetables weren't cooked and cold. My broccoli order was wrong and I was brought chicken and oyster sauce. But the waitress apologiesed and got me the right order. The shrimp looked good and my boyfriend said it tasted like an average Chinese dish. However not long after he found himself kneeled over the toilet for hours. The only reason I give this place A star is because our waitress was nice and checked on us a lot throughout the night. I don't see myself returning here for another meal. Maybe for those jalapeño puffs...."}
{"text":"Luv this place it's scottsdale meets bar and Chinese food they have live bands get crazy so much fun. Great value. Been coming for years thx. Dan"}
{"text":"What a joke! Called in order. Showed up 15 minutes later. After a half an hour of waiting at the counter i still could not be told when my food would be ready. Rude staff would barely acknowledge me despite me being patient and courteous at every request. Walked out. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Shout out to the tatted up waitress who gave us our to-go boxes, but then she disappeared and never gave us our check. After 10 more minutes, the check showed up via a different waitress, but the damage was already done. Guess who we spotted as we were walking out the door - yep ole tatty had taken off to get herself some takeout food. I hope her food was better than our nasty meal. The fried wontons had none of the promised cream cheese and a horrid filling of old chicken and grease. Luckily, they were 99 cents. My sweet and sour chicken was terrible globbed with an sweet orange sauce and the fried rice always tastes like they use old oil. House lo mein overpriced and too greasy and flat beer. Not a great meal and i hope ms. Tattoo learned her lesson when ahe saw her tip."}
{"text":"Greatest drink specials in all of central Scottsdale. All hail the Asian/Chuy's/San Felipe's/dive bar king!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here - I was super excited and it turned out to be the worst Chinese food I have ever had. Almost like something was wrong. The honey crisp shrimp was good, but the pepper beef was awful - we didn't eat any of it and they still charged us - never eating here again."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in to have breakfast on a whim because we saw the guy out front waving a sign. We didn't know it was a bar but since we were hungry we stayed but we were leery. Surprisingly the food was good. Nice and hot typical American style diner breakfast that we thoroughly enjoyed. Large servings. My sausages were over cooked crispy which is luckily exactly how I like it and the ham and bacon were perfect. I will go againand hopefully the food will be just as good."}
{"text":"Won't be back. Made the mistake of going here for dinner with my wife, thinking it was a legit Chinese restaurant. It's more like a bar that happens to serve run of the mill Chinese food. Saw no Asians working or dining here. This is not legit Chinese. Bland seasonings. Texture of the chicken led us to believe it was processed, maybe even precooked and frozen."}
{"text":"I figured I this was just another Chinese restaurant, but in actuality it's a dive bar that happens to serve Chinese food. The only good things I can say about this place are that the service is good and they have a great beer selection. But the food is awful, and the atmosphere is even worse. Picture a bunch of drunk idiots loudly yelling at each other across the room, while terrible music blasts from the speakers. How this place has managed to stay in business is one of life's great mysteries."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not for everyone.  I walked in and there was rock music playing so my initial thought was this is a cool concept.  The ambience is awesome!  It's rock music with Chinese food with a bar atmosphere.  There is an area to play pool, darts, and other games.  I'm sure John Taffer and Gordon Ramsay would have a field day with this establishment but I like it.  It's unique and doesn't fall into the status quo of what a Chinese restaurant should be.   We ordered the orange chicken which was good.  Someone mentioned that the lunch menu was pricey.  I don't get it.  $8.99 to $10.99 isn't pricey for lunch.  It's reasonable.  The co-owner, Jamie was really nice and cool!  I would definitely try this again.  I'm glad we finally tried this establishment out after driving pass it too many times and not stopping."}
{"text":"This place is more dive bar than what I think of with a Chinese Restaurant. Stopped in to catch the last quarter of the basketball game. Lots of TVs and the sound was to the game vs. random music. I noticed another group to the side watching a soccer game.   The staff wasn't very friendly but service was quick. They have a lot of beers on tap but I got a weird look when I asked for a beer list. (I find a beer list way more efficient than yelling over music to ask what they have.)"}
{"text":"We had a great fundraiser event here at Chop and Wok - Scottsdale- on July 3, 2016.  Great artsy decor, spotlessly clean (including restrooms!), and really good service  Thank you for hosting our event!  We will spread the word about your wonderful venue!"}
{"text":"This Asian restaurant is run by americans..weird because the atmosphere is nothing like what you'd expect in an Asian restaurant. I wouldn't even know I was in an Asian restaurant if I walked in here without knowing the name.  Service is good but food not all that great.  I ordered chicken curry,  meat was tough and rice was not fresh at all. ..."}
{"text":"just love this place, really one of the best Chinese in town. fast delivery, last time I got it home in less then 20 min. love the dinning atmosphere,  bar & Chinese,  great combo"}
{"text":"I didn't realize that the interior of this restaurant is kind of an oddity until I looked at the pictures here. Nonetheless, this is one of the few restaurants that deliver around midnight so I decided to try them out. The food came in 45 minutes and I ordered the house special fried rice which was actually quite tasty and the portions were massive. I mainly ordered the house special as I wanted to try an assortment of meats and vegetables. I'm happy to say that the fried rice was more than satisfactory and that I would get it again.  The delivery driver was not overly friendly, but understandable seeing as how it was very late at night. I wasn't expecting much from the food here but if you're looking for late night Chinese food this is probably the best you're gonna find in the area."}
{"text":"...Northern Cali resident, 3rd time here for a repeat of my favorite late night tap brew & good grub combo. Once again, good as the 1st two times.  I always get the Noodle Bowl with Curry Chicken spicy.  The ambiance, the staff, and the music all gel just right.  Not too many places play this music (i.e. Deftones, Sublime, etc) at a cool bar while you order Asian fusion food.  Tonight my server (she also was my bartender) provided awesome, beyond friendly service.  Three-peat happy customer here; Right on Chop & Wok!"}
{"text":"This place is a very odd mix of biker/skater dive bar and Chinese restaurant. Kind of cool atmosphere, but also trying a little too hard to be hip and trying to be more Tempe than Scottsdale, which is a bit of a fail. Personally I can totally handle the dive bar atmosphere, but the really loud music was very annoying - in our case, it was rather awkward to sit next to a table of seniors while super vulgar rap music was playing. Kinda makes this place more geared towards people aged 50 and under, and bikers. We went on a Sunday evening around 6:30pm and the service was awful. We were seated at a dirty booth that still had fortune cookie crumbs on it and was sticky. the menus were sticky also... gross!  On top of that, we sat there for over 25 minutes before the waitress showed up to ask what we would like to drink! needless to say we were ready to order the entire dinner at that point since we waited so long. We specifically said we were starting with the family size Wonton soup, crab puffs and Char-Shu pork, and for our entrees we ordered the large Mongolian beef and the small honey crisp chicken. While it took forever to get our order taken, the food was ready in about 10 minutes, which was a bit of a surprise. But they dropped the ball again by bringing out ALL our food at once! what the heck? This was so unprofessional - by the time we finished one plate to move on to the next it was totally cold. We specifically stated what we were \"starting\" with, but I guess the staff there couldn't care less that there is a pretty simple protocol when serving food - appetizers first, and then entrees... not everything at once. This really put a damper on our meal as we felt rushed because we wanted everything to stay hot, which didn't happen. The \"family size\" soup came in one single serving bowl with 1 spoon - we flagged another waitress who confirmed that was the single small soup, not family size; we informed our waitress she brought out the wrong size but it was ok, we'll just share the small bowl, as long as she didn't charge us for the larger size. Well low and behold, when the bill came it was indeed the larger size. Normally this would just be an honest error, but after having told the waitress what happened, it seemed rather unethical of her to not bother correcting the bill. I really don't care for restaurants that don't make the effort to be accurate when it comes to charging you - shady shady shady.  Now on top of the lousy service, the food ended up being subpar. The crab puffs were nice and crispy, but they were tiny; the smallest crab puffs I have seen in a while. But that was the least of our worries. The Wonton soup was a disgusting disaster. First off, they add way too many ingredients to it...it was like a salad with all the different veggies in there. The beauty in Wonton soup is the simplicity of the broth and the dumplings, with maybe some green onions. But here it was the kitchen sink thrown in, including floating shrimp. The Wontons somehow disintegrated and the soup was just wonton particles swimming in veggies and shrimp. Easily one of the worst soups I have ever been charged $10 for.  The Char-Su pork - credit for the meat itself, it was really good. Nicely bbq'd with a sauce that wasn't overbearing. However the plate itself was another disaster. There was barely any meat on it, and once we picked it out the meat, it was all shredded cabbage in sauce, in a pretty gross hot mess. Not worth the price at all. More meat, less cabbage filler to make the plate seem larger than it is, please! And then our cold entrees - the honey chicken was basically the General's Chicken slathered in honey. Didn't even have sesame seeds for a little flavour. It was not crispy at all, and was just drenched in honey. Would never order that again, it was really disappointing. the \"large\" Mongolian beef was on a bigger plate, but really was the same portion as the small and I would even say that I thought it had less meat on it than the small chicken plate. So kinda a ripoff to upsize it I think. Like the pork, the Mongolian beef itself was pretty tasty. But once we picked out all the meat, which was not a lot, the plate was just a giant pile of slop - shredded cabbage and sauce. When we were ordering the waitress bragged \"oh we have huge portions here!\"... that is a bit of a scam because the portions seemed to be mostly shredded cabbage filler! This was pretty off-putting to say the least. So from the inattentive and lousy service, to the deceptive portions with shredded cabbage making up 60% of the plates, the cold food, the disastrous soup, the inaccurate bill... the meal was a total fail. Ultimately the dive bar atmosphere with the inappropriately vulgar music was maybe the best part of the experience, because the food and service were mediocre at best. Not worth the $60 I dropped there for 2 people, not at all.  I would recommend trying RED HOUSE on Via Linda instead -best Chinese in the valley."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good because many people tell me about their first location and how good it was.  It wasn't.  Feel very lucky if you show up and they notice!! Service is slow and horrible."}
{"text":"Eclectic neighborhood bar, other than the sign upon entering you would not expect this place to serve chinese food, guessing in a former life it was a pub / sports bar and retains all of the elements of such.   Service - Good. Food - I'd say hit and miss, I'd suggest sticking with items that would be made fresh and avoid or at least inquire on any item (such as breaded food) to see if it's fresh or frozen.  The fresh food that I have had has been fairly good and ranks a 3.0-3.5 Environment - Pub with good number of TV's but not the best viewing angles.   Other - Weekend breakfast is a what you'd find at a typical five and diner, priced well and good portions. Jalapeno popper / wonton were the real deal, very spicy!"}
{"text":"I am being generous with 2 stars. The poo poo platter royal at $13 was just so so. The BBQ ribs were small and mostly bone, little meat. Most of the other items were typical bar food quality, nothing like a good Chinese restaurant. Beef with snow peas the sauce was too thick like gravy and not much meat. Steamed rice just Ok and served in a bowl  with  no cover  to keep it warm and moist. Place has bar atmosphere with loud music  playing. If you are  looking  for  a  good  Chinese  dinner this is not  the  place. I am surprised  by the favorable  comments."}
{"text":"Do NOT come here for food. If you like really loud screaming music and dirty college dive bar ambiance - but no college near by so it's just a dirty bar - by all means come. Sit at the bar for the full effect of being ignored as the bartenders go about their social life. Good times!  The food - uh, I would say both the proteins on my Kung pow two were like a day or more past expiration. Seriously, I hope I don't get sick from the two pieces I ate. Rice and the sauce were the only edible things on the plate, if you mixed them carefully, avoiding the other unidentifiable things in the heavy slathering of brown goo. I would have sent it back but didn't want the hassle. I just wanted out of here."}
{"text":"This was our first back at Chop N Wok since they reopened. We had normally gotten carry out only. We liked the new location, it is much easier to get in and out of and find a parking place.   They have great beer selection.  Glad to see Sleepy Dog Red Rover Ale. Looking forward to trying Mr. Pineapple on our next trip.  The food was excellent and very well done. I had the Cantonese Scampi which was very good. Appetizers were very good also. The Jalapeno Poppers and the crab puffs were both very tasty. Everyone enjoyed their food  Service was ok, but not outstanding. Our beers set on the waitress stand at the bar longer than normal. There were only maybe 3 tables with people at them.  They had plenty of help shooting the breeze that possibly could have gotten it to the table sooner.   We enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the great beer selection.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Jaime, Katie and their staff always make you feel welcome, and the atmosphere is funky and laid back.  They have a rotating beer selection that can make even the biggest beer snob happy, and the food is killer...what more can you ask for??  The lunch specials are amazing as well, try the Kung Pao or the Kiwi-strawberry chicken, and don't forget the crab puffs!"}
{"text":"I come here to drink,  not to eat. I have only made it through one maybe 2 pieces of the meat on my plate as it tastes disgusting.   The only thing here I really like is the jalapeño puffs they are friggen awesome.  The sauces taste so so,  the meat is gross,  and the decor is a little on the obnoxious side.  But it's cheap and fast for lunch if your in a hurry.    My friends love this place for the cheap beers.  I guess that's a good reason to like a bar.  I don't drink cheap beer either so I only come here with my friends and as always order a whiskey.    Give it a shot the food is not for me but hey you never know.  The people that work here are awesome and have never had bad service."}
{"text":"Yay, wings!  Seriously. The wings here are a true thing of beauty. They are the crispiest and most delicious wings ever--even when they're drenched in General Tsau's sauce (which, by the way, is also glorious).  Clearly, I'm a fan. I also enjoy the sweet n'sour chicken. It's pretty tasty, too.  I've seen a bunch of Yelp comments in which folks are complaining that the food is bad or that it's not \"authentic.\" If you're looking for authentic Chinese food, go to China. Don't go to a dive bar in Scottsdale.  The food at Chop n'Wok is Gringo Chinese. But it's glorious. And it's everything you could ever want when you're throwing down a bunch of beers."}
{"text":"Oh My God, no no never again.  Tried it after passing it for years, so I went for some take out after they moved..  Food was 0 stars, beef tasted old in fried rice, chicken tasted odd also, I have had better fried house rice m,any other places in the city and other states for sure.  My friend had pepper beef which also not good and she said it was very old tasting.  perhaps others can see some positives here in new location... but food is not worth trying it."}
{"text":"As an extreme lover of Chinese cuisine, this food is just bad. I ordered spring rolls, crab wonton, and general tsos chicken. The spring rolls were so over fried that they disintegrated  in my hands after the first bite. The crab puffs were actually ok. The General Tsos was on a level of bad, I never knew existed. First off, the chicken was so tough and dry, that I actually couldn't even chew a few of the pieces. I've had beef jerky that was more tender than this. I didn't even know that you could make chicken this dry and unflavored. The sauce was basically sugar water, with about 4 pieces of broccoli and a few onion slices. The rice was one giant clump of starch that looked and tasted like it had been sitting in a pot for two or three days, and then reheated.   I usually try and give a place two try's before I make final judgement.  But, this food was so horrible that there is no way I'd pay another cent to them. If I could, I'd ask for the 40 minutes of my life back, that was spent trying to chew this monstrosity of a meal."}
{"text":"Took my staff out for Lunch.  We had a great time.  Food was very good with great variety.  That atmosphere was extremely unique.  Blending a sports bar with a Chinese food."}
{"text":"One Saturday afternoon, I jumped on the 'ol innerweb and bought two Groupons, one for a Mexican restaurant and the other for a Chinese restaurant.  Since it is an election year, we decided to put our democratic process to good use and we all took a vote...Chinese it was.  The Groupon that I came across was good for dinner and drinks for 4 people.  I never heard of Chok and Wok, but thought we can't go wrong eating Chinese food in the heart of Scottsdale, right?  We arrived around 6pm Saturday evening and located the restaurant next to NYPD (pizza)...they each have a small store-front/patio area and they were located in a strip-mall setting.  We walked up the little staircase, leading to the 2 chair outdoor front patio area and asked ourselves whether or not this was really a Chinese restaurant....from the outside, it looked like a cantina...hmmm, clue# 1.  As we walked inside to the reception area, we immediately noticed the distinctive smell of a gym locker...hmmm, clue #2.  A hostess/bar-maid/phone-taker greeted us and told us to seat ourselves wherever.  Well, first observations was that this is not going to be fine dining.  The restaurant had plenty of TV's positioned around, airing UFC fights and other sporting events, and the walls were decorated with skateboards...yes, skateboards.  If management was going for the dark and divey atmosphere of a grunge bar, then they have hit their mark.  As we looked around for a table, we figured that we must have beat the dinner crowd as there were plenty of tables to be had.  We chose a booth up front as this was somewhat away from the bar.  We were greeted by our waitress, who was cordial, but not very sociable.  I was not expecting to know her life story, but at least introduce yourself for Heaven sakes.  We informed her about the Groupon and she advised she needed to ask someone else as she was unsure what to do.  The other waitress came over and explained the Groupon was equivalent to $58 dollars for anything on the menu, including adult beverages.   I asked the other waitress what she liked and she recommended a \"gummy bear\"...ok, sounds interesting, why not, right?  My husband wasn't feeling so adventurous and he ordered a simple Bloody Mary, using a well vodka.  He asked the waitress to make his drink extra-spicey.  Not sure what the prices were for the adult beverages, but the Groupon included 4 drinks.  My daughter ordered the broccoli and chicken $8.99, my son ordered the teriyaki chicken with fried rice $8.99, my husband ordered the house chicken $8.99 extra-spicey, and I ordered the honey shrimp $11.99.  After giving our orders, our waitress had to come back a minute later to ask my husband what he had ordered because she forgot...clue# 3.  I know restaurants try to manage their overhead, but really, c'mon, make sure your wait-staff has a notepad and pen to write down the orders.  Food for thought, getting the food orders wrong will probably not make you employee of the month.  The dishes were cooked quickly, almost too quick, approximately 10 minutes from the time we had ordered it.  Each entree came out on individual medium-sized plates, each were just enough for a single person.  A big bowl of white rice was brought out and the fried rice for my son's teriyaki dish was brought out on it's own elongated-plate...the fried rice was plenty for 2 people.  I looked at my plate and  thought, 'wow, i scored, my honey-glazed, tempura-battered, shrimp were huge.'  As I took a bite, I realized the honey shrimp dish was in fact honey chicken...no wonder the pieces were huge.  However, I was not about to complain and have them remake it...I have always been fearful that the restaurant staff would do unspeakable and vile things to my food should I complain or have them remake my dish.  My husband's house chicken dish looked ok, it was just tempura-battered chicken, covered with a dark-thick sauce...at least it was chicken...so we hoped.  My husband said the house sauce was extremely salty and they forgot to make it spicey...on the bright side, they had a bottle of Siracha readily available. The broccoli and chicken was covered in a teriyaki sauce, but the dish tasted as if it had been sitting awhile.  The teriyaki chicken with fried rice was decent, only because they got the fried rice right.  Neither my kids really liked their dishes and they asked for their food to be boxed-up...which is code for we want to go home and throw it in the trash.    Our waitress redeemed the Groupon and told us it covered the entire bill...the best news of the night!  We still gave her a tip (yes, it was real cash money).  Oh well, we learned one lesson...the results of a Democratic voting process doesn't always give you the best choice."}
{"text":"Great food, great people, great drinks!!  Can't say enough about the service and quality of food at this place. Don't expect traditional Chinese food here as its more american Chinese food. But delicious non the less!  Beer lovers must visit on a regular!"}
{"text":"The food is not great. Everything tastes like it has been cooked in recycled oil. But the delivery drivers are nice and they are open way past most restaurants offering delivery in the area."}
{"text":"I have to agree with some other Yelpers on this one. No, this is not the greatest Chinese food you will ever eat. But, it is far from the worst. Like many others have stated, Chop and Wok is a bar that does Chinese on the side. So, don't come here expecting a five star meal.   What you can expect is this: average Chinese food at an average price, quick and speedy delivery, and personable customer service.  I work in the same complex that Chop and Wok is in  (SE corner of Shea and Scottsdale), and I have to admit: I am SO sick of the typical places that deliver around here. Thinking to change it up a bit, I ordered from here on a late Monday afternoon (today actually) for some Vegetable Lo Mein, and order of Crab Puffs, and a side of white rice. The girl on the phone was really nice, and made the ordering process fluid and easy. She also answered my menu questions without hesitation and did not rush me. She told me the order would take around 20 minutes to arrive.   About 10 minutes later, a guy came with my order. He was courteous and well groomed. Something that I find important in a delivery driver. No complaints there.   My order came exactly as I had expected. With the exception of the Lo Mein. It was HUGE. I ordered the large size, expecting to be able to take some home for anyone else who wanted some, and was pleasantly surprised when it came in a take out box STUFFED to the brim. For $9.99, it was a decent value. The only thing I didn't like was that there was a lot of excess sauce in the bottom of the take out container, and that there were also bamboo shoots mixed in with the veggies. Not a huge fan, but it was an ingredient that could have easily been picked out. The crab puffs were excellent. They were large, and stuffed with quite a bit of crab and cream cheese filling. Much more than you would find at a Panda Express or similar establishment. The white rice was also good, but then again it's hard to mess up.   My favorite thing about Chop and Wok? NO MINIMUM DELIVERY FEE! Praise the Lord of Delivery! Now I don't have to 3 weeks of decent Chinese just to satisfy my lunch craving. Like I said. Nothing phenomenal, but definitely not as bad as some reviewers are making it out to be. Pictures posted."}
{"text":"HOLY HANGOVER MONDAY...  Came home Monday morning from a three day bender.. starving and feeling like Kate Moss. Called into work for a little PTO... crashed in my bed and dialed up some disgusting take out food. Hey I deserved it, I was on a pure vodka diet... don't judge me.  I order enough food for four people knowing I will nosh a few days on left overs. I think I had Won Tons, egg drop soup, Chinese chicken salad and black pepper chicken.  It arrives and I am so excited!!!! But due to my shrunken stomach I ate two or three bites and was so uncomfortably full..... then passed out on my couch. I woke a few hours later and had more of each meal throughout the day. All good and no complaints at this moment...... BUTT (heehee)  The rest of the week my lower GI tract not so happy with all that nonsense...   I'm still not complaining though, that makes a girl lean also.   Nothing like a \"cheat' meal combined with a colon detox"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE SHIZ! ladies, watch out when Shane is working.. He will win you over with his amazing service and charm. Rachel is also the bomb.com! I love her! This bar is like our \"Cheers\" and whenever we come in we have our drinks ready before we even get to the bar.   Jill is one of the best servers I've ever had! She's super attentive and always has a smile on her face.   The food is awesome.   This place is awesome.  The end."}
{"text":"Every time I have friends in town, I take them to Chop and Wok. The decor is wild, the food is delicious and the beer is always cold with TONS of variety.   Eclectic is an understatement.   Bloody Mary bar, breakfast and NFL Sunday ticket. The staff is friendly and attentive. If you're looking for a fun and entertaining place, come here for sure!"}
{"text":"Lots of hard workers there who know what they're doing, the food is great, prices aren't bad at all for what you get, and the delivery driver Kevin was cool. Def worth your food and time!"}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME!!! In Scottsdale for work for the next several months and wanted to find some go-to order spots and decided to see what this place had to offer. Uhhhhh, I stopped in my tracks when I read their menu. $2.99 for a bottled water? $3.49 for a soda? 6pc potsticker for $9.49???! $12.49 for a chicken lo mein??! WTF???!!! NEVER would I pay those prices....not even in NYC!!!! I am all for paying a premium for premium product(s) but reading these reviews, this falls FAR from the premium mark. I have rarely been insulted by a menu solely from the prices but this is simply insulting. They should be ashamed of themselves. SMH"}
{"text":"The back story on this place is fascinating and I hope they do well. Don't go in expecting great service. Service is very hit and miss, but the food and beer are great. The restaurant/bar is really funky looking. Sort of a punk rock meets surfer spot in Scottsdale. Seems like it should be in San Diego. I liked the ribs. The wine is terrible but beer is served in a cold mug and is very good.   Open Mike was interesting to see. We were there on a great talent night....but, this probably varies.   Nice spot with a warm neighborly feel."}
{"text":"So, here's the lowdown on chop and wok!! Do you go for the food? No, while it's not awful it's just very average. Very heavy and thick loaded w MSG. Do you go for the service? No. We waited 10 minutes at our table and nobody acknowledged us. So, you ask the bartender and he will say \"I will find someone to help you\" Do you go for ambience? No, it's let's say \"eclectic\" and if you look around the place is dirty. So why go? Well, it was a group of 6 of us and we had a good time. You know what to expect there, not much. But it's has a good tap beer selection, it's not pricey and you know you can't be critical of this establishment. It is what it is!!!"}
{"text":"I had the best lunch today at Chop and Wok. We had scheduled a business lunch meeting and I suggested Chop and Wok since I hadn't eaten at the restaurant since they moved to their new location. What a delightful surprise. The food was better than I ever remembered. And the service... outstanding, attentive, helpful and very friendly. When my plate came, I was so impressed with the amount of food and the beauty of the plating, I had to take a picture. Just as I thought, I could not finish the whole thing. My meeting partners were so impressed as well and made sure they talked to the owner, Stacy, letting him know they would all be back and with their friends, family and co-workers.  Thank you Chop and Wok for continuing with the great tradition of great service, food, and atmosphere.  I will be back. I promise."}
{"text":"I love Chop Wok! It's one of my favorite neighborhood hangouts.  The owner, Jamie, is so welcoming & greets us w a handshake every time. If you are looking for a laid back bar/restaurant with healthy Asian food options, Chop Wok might become your favorite hangout too.  It has been our go-to bar to watch a live game or just to hang out and listen to live music on the weekend!"}
{"text":"I have serious issues with the DECOR and the lack of Professional Attire  its like a white hot mess of I want to be a R&R joint but we serve pretty good food with a Chinese Style. Management if you are listening- We were there for lunch-& I heard you tell your two servers it is Unprofessional to be sitting down while Greeting Customers- It is but on the same note-it is unprofessional to reprimand them in front of the customers who are totally within earshot of your critique.  Suggestions Do a REBOOT OF THE DECOR. You look so messy that it is hard to sit inside your restaurant. I'm sure you have had Seniors walk in and Walk back out. It looks like a Garage Sale gone wrong. CHOP your Vegetables!! Every time we have ordered the Vegetables are WAY too Large. We like the soup- the egg rolls and then there are the entrees.  Again Taste OK presentation Not so much. You Sell Chop & Wok T Shirts.  Put them on your Servers!!!! with a pair of Jeans.  I have seen some tacky outfits on your Servers....and this would be a Easy and Welcome look. Flo's does a HAPPY  HOUR from 4 to 7 PM Everyday of the WEEK. They are PACKED  Every day of the Week. EVERY DING DANG DAY !!   Simple Formula HALF OFF ON EVERYTHING ON THE APPETIZER LIST AND HALF OFF EVERYTHING IN THE BAR.  Do these things and you will SEE us & Many more Regulars on a Very Regular Basis. OKAY HERE IS THE PLAN   1.) Change Decor [PLEASE]  2.) Put Staff in Casual but Recognizable uniform C&W shirt and jeans 3.)Chop the Veggies 4.) Have a specialized Apptz Menu and Drinks all at HALF OFF     You can thank me later. This will be the best FREE MARKETING ADVISE YOU WILL GET."}
{"text":"Had the General Tso for lunch. Crispy egg roll, crispy wantons, crispy chicken, great fried rice. Can't wait to to try others, really good. Also they have all UFC events, no cover. I'll be returning for the events and dranks. Po up, drank!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection lots of craft beers, always a great time. Not sure about the food complaints everything I've ordered has been great."}
{"text":"Order some Chinese delivery for lunch today. I got chicken lo mien, pot stickers, and lettuce wraps. First I'll start off with the most edible of dishes, the pot stickers. Seemed to be of the frozen variety and deep fried not steamed or pan fried like every other dumpling. They were boring tasting and I wasn't a fan of the outside or inside texture. Now the lo mien insanely boring no flavor one bite and I was done. Now the chicken lettuce wraps totally inedible. By far one of the worst things I've ever put in my mouth. Just gross tasting, can't really describe it but I took one bite and then dropped that bite back on to my plate. On the plus side the delivery was reasonably fast, items were well packaged and arrived hot, and came with appropriate utensils and condiments. Overall big waste of my money and I'm def still hungry. Too bad because I had fond memories of the old location."}
{"text":"one of the best kept secrets in Scottsdale. The food consistently goes above and beyond my expectations. Great place to go and meet new people. service is fantastic, last time had this girl with blue/purple hair and was very impressed with her service. make sure to try the jalapeño crab puffs."}
{"text":"This place is so weird I can't help but to give is 4 stars. You're not sure if it's a bar or a Chinese restaurant.  There is no understandable theme to the whole place. It is so random in there that I felt like I was in the mind of a schizophrenic.  And for whatever reason I liked that it was so confusing and all over the place.  The staff was friendly, the drinks were strong, and tons of people were there and the crowd was as colorful as their random decorum. They even went out of their way to make me a drink they had never heard of before and didn't do a bad job at it either. I would return here again."}
{"text":"Decent place, a little sports bar-ish but the beers on tap are all what is decent and they very regularly. Jamie, behind the bar, is pretty decent, and if he's not too overloaded, he will let you sample a number of different beers on tap. The Chinese food that they make as part of their raison d'être is all right, they don't have whole chilies, I have a chili paste, which is all right but I prefer the whole chill. The place is much better than the old location, location was worse than a dive, but the current location is pretty decent, and has plenty of room to sit down big bar.  I'm sure that some of this review won't make any sense, since Siri is helping me narrated but nonetheless chop and wok is decent. If you do like American style Chinese food, and shop and walk is pretty good. They have good takeout, the fried rice is our good, I usually get the orange chicken, or something like that and then instead of the white rice, get some veggie fried rice."}
{"text":"great food!! large portions and late night delivery which is nice. I worked at a resort in scottsdale so it was nice to have them deliver while I was working. nice bar, music is loud so not good for conversations lol but again, the food is great and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Below average greasy food. Very nice waitress and prompt as well. it was 12:30pm and the place was empty as well, not a good sign for weekday lunch. The Mongolian beef was barely passable, the fried rice flat and bland. Egg roll was over cooked along with the inedible fried wontons. I liked the speedy friendly service, but there's nothing here I would come back for."}
{"text":"Thank you Shane for the outstanding Moscow Mules for us last night and making our night better! #Fuck92ndStCafe"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink before the movies, or stay and watch UFC. No Cover for UFC! Not your typical stuck up Scottsdale place. Always a good time here."}
{"text":"I have frequented this business for many years at the previous and new Scottsdale location.  I have been there 2 times since the reopening at the new location, once for take-out the other was dine-in.  I have and will always endorse the Orange Chicken here as well as the Crab Puffs.  It seems that the new to-go containers are smaller than previously used so you do not get as much bang for the buck.  Used to be a quart was plenty for 2, now, seems like less or they are not filling the newly shaped containers as much as they used to.  I like the set up for to-go orders.  Now for the eat-in food... We ordered the Jalapeno Puffs , they were a watered down verison of the popular Crab Puffs.  They take the creamy part of the filling and lightly put in some jalapenos which are watery and makes something that is tasteless, watery and not satisfying at all - take it off the menu folks!   Kung Pow Chicken has NO POW and no spice at all,  won-tons are dry and tasetless, egg rolls are average/good.    Terriyaki chicken is gristley, not a lot of chicken, LOTS of rice - complete over kill with the rice.  Iced tea, way too weak to even enjoy, just order water and save your money.  The crowd - well - the new place is right next door to the Dirty Dogg Saloon so you get a lot of the same crowd here folks - even at lunch time!  If you are not familiar, Google the place and take a look at the pics that come up.  These are the people you will be dining with at ChopNWok.  We sat and were facing a grown man seated at the bar with his slouch jeans on and his green underwear hanging out with his pants coming down with every sip of beer he took.  Not exactly what you want to have to look at when eating and definitly not something a family wants to expose their kids to.  The bar was surrounded with people that looked like a bunch of adult high school dropouts, sorry but true!    Definitely not a normal, go out and eat type crowd.  They should have just knocked the wall down between their place and the Dirty Dogg Saloon and let the crowd mix in because that is exactly what you see.  I won't be coming back to eat-in again, will just enjoy my orange chicken as take-out when I have the craving.  I was hoping the place would class-up a bit but I am convinced the \"crowd\" will keep many patrons and families away from eating in, truly a disappointment!  The biz will succeed but will lose business due to the poor choice of location.  No one wants to feel like they are in a biker bar when they are trying to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"A very odd atmosphere to be a Chinese restaurant.  The place was an entire bar, with a gothic/ rock vibe to it. Food was okay, considering the fact we had to send back a plate because the noodles were so hard and had a nasty taste.  Save your money and go out to an actual restaurant."}
{"text":"Hey, what happened? Where did you guys Go? We pulled up for our hot & sour soup and the doors were closed...Help!!!"}
{"text":"This is what u call faux Chinese. Every time I've ordered takeout they somehow screw it up. Whether it's an omission or a wrong dish, it doesn't matter. Also the quality is fair. Pretty boring not good tasting stuff.  The management has no clue. Forget about this place."}
{"text":"I ended up at this place for lunch with my parents one day because my mom had some kind of restaurant.com certificate to use before it expired, so she decided to try this place out.   When you walk inside, it doesn't feel like your at a Chinese restaurant, it looks like you're at some kind of biker bar. The decor and the food definitely clash! The way the restaurant is setup is very awkward. We sat in a booth in front of the bar, and I think it was the only booth on that side of the restaurant. It was strange because it wasn't even against a wall, and it was facing a door.. I felt like they just had a booth and needed to put it somewhere.   As far as the service. It was very average. Our waiter came to our table the normal amount of times. Refilled our drinks a few times and brought our food.. Nothing special..  However, if this review were solely based on the food itself, I wouldn't give it any stars. First off, I ordered a whiskey sour since my dad was going to have a beer. When it came, it looked like a watered down ginger ale. And it tasted terrible! I don't know what they gave me, but it was gross! I told them that the drink tasted different from what I'm use to, so they brought me a margarita. It looked and taste the same as my previous drink, so I stuck to water after that. When the waiter came to take my order, I ordered the honey chicken, and it was basically sweet and sour chicken but with honey sauce instead of the sweet and sour sauce. But the sauce on the chicken was way to thick! It made my food pretty soggy fairly quickly that I didn't even finish my food."}
{"text":"You just got a love Chop n Wok! The eclectic vibe and interesting crowd means you will always have a memorable visit. The mix of decor makes you feel like you're in some sort of Chinese acid trip. It's not the best Chinese food in the world but it's good and definitely hits the spot after a few adult beverages. I've had the pork lo mein, pot stickers, and crab Rangoons and would order all of them again. Back to the adult beverages, they have a ton of good beer on tap and the mixed drinks are strong and prices are reasonable. Chop n Wok is great if you're looking for a very casual and cool place to hang with a few friends"}
{"text":"I love dive bars and I love Chinese food so I thought I would LOVE this place. Unfortunately, I also enjoy not overpaying for flavorless food.  Service was bad.... waited too long for someone to bring menus, didn't tell me the specials when I asked. When we asked for boxes, my food was taken from me and the server was gone before I even had a chance to object. Check was never brought to us, we had to go search for our server to pay.  Food was flavorless and really greasy....only time I've ever been served Chinese without soy sauce.  You could tell who the regulars were..... they were being served. I guess the staff isn't interested in adding to that list! Felt like we were interrupting play time by asking people to do their job.   Overall, it sucked and that's sad because I kept trying to like it."}
{"text":"I've been coming to chop and wok for a few years now. I usually do take out and everytime I come in Jackie is always the one to help me out. She knows my order soon as I call and is always so kind and helpful. It can really make your experience when the employees are friendly and familiar with their guests like Jackie always is. There as been a huge improvement in quality of food and service over the years. I really enjoy the teriyaki tofu fried rice and crab puffs."}
{"text":"Delivery was pretty fast for a Friday night. We ordered sweet and sour chicken. Yummy. Veggie lo mein. Yummy. Pot stickers yummy. Black pepper chicken. Meh. Nothing special. The chicken was dry and i would never have guessed there was black pepper in it. It didn't taste Asian at all, just like sautéed chicken with some veggies. Total price $40.80 not including tip.  I may order again. It wasn't bad but it didn't satisfy my Chinese take out craving."}
{"text":"I give them 4 stars.  The food was outstandingly, delicious.   My problem was the over head music.  It was(in my opinion), ridiculously loud for  a 2pm lunch and it was Heavy Metal.  That said, the service was excellent and our server was attentive."}
{"text":"I always liked this place when they were at Scottsdale and Shea, now they are around the corner on Scottsdale Road. The interior is funky dive decor. Went for lunch. Had a fantastic gal as a server, very on top of things, even bringing sodas in a to go cup without asking. The sweet and sour pork would have been good but the pork was so tough, like shoe leather, I could barely chew it. Brown rice was excellent, egg roll was marginal and the won ton was cold and tough. Portions are huge. I will give it another try to see if other dishes are better. If they use a better cut of pork this might make all the difference. Large bar area with tvs."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience with this place and my delivery order. They sent the wrong order and then made us wait over an hour to redelivery it. This would have been fine but \"management\" was so rude about the situation and to top it off the food was cold."}
{"text":"This place is right by my work and I love it! Excellent lunch specials with typical egg roll and fried rice.   The egg rolls are awesome! I got the orange chicken and it was all white meat goodness!! Sauce wasn't too sweet. I got it spicy and it was perfect.   Full bar!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had sitting at a bar. I'm actually disappointed that the food was pretty good because I have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"I liked the old place but this one is so much easier to get in and out of. the bartenders and servers are great, the atmosphere is good, it's not like any of the pretentious Scottsdale places. I dig it."}
{"text":"We discovered this little gem a couple months ago and always have a great time there.  When we go for lunch and get their lunch specials, whether we've sat at the bar or a table, the service was fantastic.  The food is plentiful, tasty, and compares to other great Chinese food that's out there.  Yes, it's more of a bar than a Chinese restaurant, but that  makes it so fun and DIFFERENT; something Scottsdale lacks lately.  (you know, tiny portions for exorbitant prices because they add the words 'craft' or hipster to it).  The manager Jamie is friendly and genuinely cares about this customers and staff.  Going there at night is a diff. experience, saw some stand-up comedians last week on our anniversary which was a total treat!  I like everything about it, incl. all the music memorabilia on the walls.  We'll look forward to returning for years! :)"}
{"text":"Everything we have had here has been fantastic! It's out go to quick to go place! It's even better when you eat in! We always have leftovers! People are always nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night, 2 or three tables counting us, and 2 people at the bar, so they were not busy at all.  However we got absolutely terrible service, the bartender and waitress were more interested in socializing and checking their phones then waiting on tables.  The food was OK, but we won't be back.  Somebody needs to train these people to wait on customers and not socialize.  Maybe it could use the services of Restaurant Stakeout to shake this staff up."}
{"text":"I drove all the way from 51st Ave. and cactus to this place. It was supposed to be \"the best Chinese food in Scottsdale\". I ordered $85 worth of food that was absolutely disgusting AND they didn't send me home with any white rice at all. So, because I live so far away I had to go home and make white rice to go with our dinner. All the food was very overcooked , soft and mushy. We got some vegetable stirfry that was far from stirfry it was soaked in sauce more like a soup. The eggrolls were gross and I don't know what this chop Suey really was but it didn't taste like any I have ever had before. I'm not one to waste food so I really tried to eat it but ended up throwing it all away. None of it had a good flavor and the two lg. orders of orange chicken that I got were only half full! I also ordered pork fried rice that had no flavor and thick squares of pork in it that were tough and dry. Will definitely never return."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing owners and a fun atmosphere!  Love this place and wish we could visit more often :)"}
{"text":"Wanted to try some local Chinese food used my grub hub account. We ordered chow mien and the noodles came out brunt I call to let them know and the girl who answered said \" well that's how we make it here\" well ok then thanks. We won't be ordering again wrong place to spend $60."}
{"text":"This is a really interesting place. I don't come often and really only come for the free UFC events. Always a great atmosphere and the inside design is like a beach bar; which is funny since it's a Chinese joint. Service isn't great but I feel like they all try to make a great experience but their are a few bad seeds behind the bar. Great drink specials and craft beer list. Be careful of the food I think the chicken has a funny taste. I would stay away unless you are getting the fried appetizers.  One huge turn off for me is the live music. Went one night and some character in a batman mask was rapping and starting beer chug contests. This is a great dive bar for sports and that's about it. I would give 4 stars if not for the loud open mic night."}
{"text":"Terrible take out service. Thought twice before I took food home bc entrance and restaurant looked very dirty. Asked three times for peanut sauce only to get home and find curry sauce. Called to report and was told that's how they make their peanut sauce. With curry?  Lettuce wraps very salty and although they used romaine lettuce it was old and ends were brown.  Waste  of$20. This place used to be the go to places for take out asian food. Never again!"}
{"text":"Yay, they brought back the homemade egg rolls!!!!   Had those and crab puffs at Happy Hour last night and would order both again.  That said, they really need to get their breakfast cook in more often.  They only offer breakfast on Sundays....and their breakfast is one of the few things on the menu that doesn't come across as reheat and serve (ie, not made on site.)   Showed up at 11:00 sharp for breakfast and guess what, the chef leaves for the day so you are out of luck if you show up any time after 10:59.   As regulars, that was more than frustrating.  Oh, by the way we love the owner and the bartenders....super friendly and always make you feel at home."}
{"text":"Dined in once and had dinner delivered once. The food was Pricy,  Oily, and Bland.  However, the drink (s) I had while we waited for our food were good and the staff there are pretty cool.   An okay neighborhood spot for drinks.  I will stay away from ordering food."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years now, glad they re-opened the new location. It's much bigger inside and parking is easier. But I come here mostly for the food. The Lo Mein is my absolute favorite! But everything is good on the menu, all the soups, the Kung Pao Chicken, crab puffs, EVERYTHING. Just had my Xmas dinner here with my boyfriend and had awesome service from Trevor. I will be back again, and again."}
{"text":"I went to the new location, because I loved the old location and the way the bar and the food ordering was set up.  But the new place is dirty, smelly and just not clean. Its just too bad the owners don't do something to clean up the place. Food still good."}
{"text":"Had lunch. I dont remember what lunch special i ordered but im craving it 4 hours later. So good, and filling.. love the decor and beer selection was amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Chop & Wok a couple weeks ago and I've got to say, I'm so glad I did! I've been searching for a good Chinese food joint and I'll be looking no further. The food was fantastic and arrived piping hot (I actually had to let it cool a bit before eating) which is rare for anything delivery. The gentleman who took my order was very kind and the delivery driver was very friendly. The food tasted fantastic as well! We had the orange chicken, honey shrimp, Hawaiian fried rice and crab puffs...all of it was delicious and the portions were large enough to leave a bit for lunch the next day. My experience from start to finish was a total win! I can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, beer, and complete atmosphere. The staff is very welcoming and always in a good mood. Amazing flow of new craft beers always coming in as well. One of my favorite spots for lunch or a night of fun!"}
{"text":"The place was quiet walking in. The girls at the entrance said to have a seat anywhere and a waitress would be right with you. We waited me and my male date and another couple walked in right after us. Not even a minute passed and they had a waitress serving them. The same two waitresses at the door passed us countless times and not  even ten minutes passed. And where at the couples table that walked in after us countless times. Thanks chop and wok! We both felt very uncomfortable and disrespected. Won't come again and will tell all my friends and family not to come and waist their time. But the tall girl at the bar was nice!"}
{"text":"I love the peanut chicken!!! So yummy"}
{"text":"It's a great place to come to for sports events! Food is great and the workers are nice!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Chop n Wok since the mid 80's. In the past year, service has become increasing bad....not just incredibly slow, but incredibly RUDE. I've chalked it up to a bad day a few times, but it's become the norm. Orders are wrong and when the OWNER says he'll \"leave a credit up front for you next order\" instead of refunding your money....DON'T BELIEVE HIM! We are sadly done with the restaurant."}
{"text":"We had food delivered to our hotel when we stayed in AZ.  For starters the order taker girl was clueless. Gave my number. Stated I was at a hotel and how to reach me. Repeated myself a few times. She put me on hold to answer a ringing phone and hung up on me.   Called back. Talked to a guy who then transferred me back over to order taker. Got my order in.   So I sit and wait and wait..and wait.. And my two friends after an hour of waiting remind me of the time frame.  Call back and talk to clueless. Checking to make sure they have the right info and to see if the order is out for delivery because we are at a hotel. She puts me on hold again.   I look up and see my delivery guy and hang uo on clueless. Eta 90 minutes.  Sigh.  Food wasn't good and 1 of the 3 orders was wrong.   I will admit I will deal with an attitude or subpar customer service if the food is really good. This food wasn't good at all. Took forever to come and they messed up our order."}
{"text":"What Chop & Wok lacks in food it makes up in ambiance. So, no they don't have the worlds most spectacular Chinese food, but it doesn't suck either. Stick to the basics here kids and you will walk away happy.  A few weeks ago, I found myself hungry and the original choice for dinner had a super long wait... so while to figure out what's next, I looked across the street and saw Chop & Wok. This place has been a staple in Scottsdale for as long as I can remember... It hides in a very disconcerting strip mall. But we all decided to give it a try anyways, because why the heck not! Pulling into the parking lot I didn't know what to expect... But I will be totally frank, what I walked into was SO not what I was expecting. Chop & Wok is more dive bar with Chinese food... I mean they have huge flying pigs hanging from the ceiling and surf boards and so much randomness it's not even funny... But that is so the charm of chop & wok.   If your a Scottsdale native and have always wondered... I recommend checking this sweet hidden spot! You will have some epic stories for sure."}
{"text":"Great place for a great time and good food. Too much MSG but for a fun time and some good food it's worth it.  3 stars are for the place and atmosphere the food really get 2 stars."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food ever. The staff is friendly and the bar is great. You will not be disappointed by your experience here."}
{"text":"Came here late at night with my boyfriend on his birthday! I HIGHLY recommend this bar for late nights. All in all the food is amazing!! The service was awesome and the music and comedy is a nice touch. Cant wait to come back with friends!"}
{"text":"I Love This Place...I work across the way and I eat there most days for lunch and I have to say the food is awesome and everyone who works there are extremely nice and courteous...always a smile !!! I've met the owners and see them more often then not behind the bar working! And the decor is awesomeness!! So if your looking for the spot to chill, drink, and not spend a ton of cash and has great food.chop and wok is the place.."}
{"text":"This place cracks me up. Part bar, part Chinese restaurant with the most random decorations. From dragons to surf boards to framed microphones. I came here for greasy Chinese after a late night - and it did the job."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Nice atmosphere, bartender is very professional. Good size place. Would come here again. Definitely worth a stop in."}
{"text":"The people were nice but the food was not so great. The rice had a tap water taste to it and I had some crunchy pieces of rice.  The spicy Kung pao chicken was not spicy at all and the taste wasn't the greatest either..   again nice people but probably wouldn't order from them again"}
{"text":"Honesty to God best crab puffs in town! Love love love this place! Great for take out (super quick) and dine in atmosphere is chill."}
{"text":"Been back many times. The owner Jamie and his entire staff are great. 30+ beers food served late and live music. High end snotty Scottsdale place? Nope. Excellent neighborhood joint to have a great time at."}
{"text":"The only reason I am even giving them 2 stars is because the decor and ambiance could be great! My boyfriend and I went here on a Monday evening at about 1130 PM. It was really dead in the except a few of the employees who were off shift. When we came in it smelled as if some one had taken disgusting mop water and thrown it around like holy water to christen the whole place. YUK. But, we were hungry and wanted to give this place a try since it is right next to our favorite pizza joint, Oregano's.  We ordered the BBQ Lo Mein, Orange Beef, and Orange Chicken, and Crab Wantons. All of it was gross. The orange sauce had no flavor at all but when combined with the chicken and beef it made it have a bitter harsh after taste. The Lo Mein was slimy, mushy, and tasted like beef ramen  packets had been thrown in. The wantons were underfilled, dripping in grease, and tasteless.  Our server was tolerable, she obviously was more interested in socializing with her obnoxious co workers than making sure our teas were full or we were ok. We were each going to order a beer or two, but never got the chance. She kept asking if we were ready for our check, even before we were half done with our meal. We had to wait till after 1 AM for our direct deposit to hit our account before we could leave, and trust me, it was not a moment too soon.I had already been sick to my stomach once since eating there in the two hours. If I had thought about it I would have asked for a refund. We definitely will not be returning!"}
{"text":"My fiancé's coworker recommended this restaurant so we decided to make a delivery order.  They said it would take an hour, which seems long, but then it took two hours.  The driver didn't even make it, the bartender delivered our food, which by the way was pretty bad.  The chicken was soggy and most of the food was cold.  Not to mention it was over $100 for four people.  I can't say much to the dine in location, but would never order delivery from this place again."}
{"text":"Amazing place always have good vibes , not expensive ,and the food is really good ! Highly recommended !! Try the fried rice!"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time this past week. This will be our only and last time there. The food was not even edible and I left it. My friend had a cup of tea and it smelled like cleaning fluid. The waitress agreed and, took it off our bill. I would never go there again, ever. Besides the horrendous food, the place was not clean at all."}
{"text":"First of all, the wings here are giant and delicious! They have an extensive menu, generous portions, and have no problem customizing anything you want. They have a huge selection of beer on tap, one of a kind ambiance inside, and the owner Jamie is amazing! I don't even live in AZ anymore, but try and make it a point to stop in every time I come for a visit! This place is run by truly wonderful people and I have to say it's one of my favorite places!! Definitely one of a kind; Good food, great people!"}
{"text":"The old chop wok has been replaced by this horrible mess of a restaurant.  Since the old place burned down, we have tried the new place several times. From eat in with the dorm room decor and bad service to the horrible wait times on deliveries.  This last episode was the last straw.  The omitted the rice and we waited 3 hours for it.  I understand tgatvstuff happens but management AND ownership was non sympathetic and non responsive to my complaint.  No more and I make a point to mention how bad they are to everyone I know.  Our new place is Joyful chimes at Hayden and Scottsdale road.  They appreciate the business."}
{"text":"I'm a young student who has a tough time dealing with places that close at 9 or 10 PM.  I don't start my grind until about 11 or maybe even midnight & that's why I love this place.  It's the latest place around thats open and they have some serious banging food.  I'm all about the fried rice, its so tasty!  I have only ever gotten the food delivered or picked it up for take out.  The bar kind of looks like a dive but isn't that what makes them the best?   When I'm in Scottsdale and I've got those late night munchies this is my place.  Go check it out, I'm sure you won't regret it!   Return factor- 100%"}
{"text":"We were looking for Chinese food and decided to give Chop&Wok a try in its' new location.  Walking in on a Saturday evening, we immediately found ourselves in a bar with plenty of happy hour revelers who were loudly enjoying themselves, screaming atop the music.  Smokers on the patio with a door left open means the whole place reeked of smoke.  Yahoooweee!   Keeping an open mind, we placed a food order.  Service was pleasant but painfully slow.  Food arrived with no serving utensils (really???), we didn't bother to go hunt someone down for these missing items.   Happily we actually did have a fork AND knife (try getting a knife in a real Chinese restaurant).  Food was okay but nothing remarkable.    We were told they had live music scheduled for 8pm but we didn't stick around long enough to find out who or what that meant.  Oddly enough, for a place that is \"newly relocated\" it looked like it had been there for a really long time, ie., peeling paint on the walls, worn out barstools, doesn't look very clean....  I would classify as typical divvy bar ambience.  If you are looking for a bar that happens to have a Chinese food menu, this is your place.  For me, not so much."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Friendly staff great food.  Jamies is a great guy, always trys to remember everyones names."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since the late 90's when I was in college. I watched them grow from one small room to two. I was so excited to try their new location. I came in after work alone on a Thursday night and sat at the bar. I was excited to see the great beer selection. I ordered a vanilla porter. It was quite tasty. It took awhile to put a food order in but the food came out pretty fast. I had the orange chicken and a teriyaki egg roll. Both where very good. My beer was gone by this point and I was never offered water. I sat and sat and sat and sat with zero service. My bartender a female with sunglasses on her head ignored me and the only other guy sitting on the one side of the bar. A bartender asked him eventually what he wanted but Didnt acknowledge me. Finally the female bartender asked if I wanted another beer I said no just a to go container and my tab. I am seriously disappointed. So my one piece of advice is call in a to go and pick it up yourself. Don't waster your time with the terrible customer service!!  Ug. Terrible!!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here.  Fried Rice, Lo Mien and the soups are great. Definitely recommend this place. I have never been to an Asian sports bar before, pretty cool and hip, nice place to go if you need a late night bite."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for lunch, it took over 2 hours to deliver 3 meals less than a block away. The food was ok (not worth the price), and were missing items from our order anyway (but were still charged for them). I won't waste anymore time or money here, and I definitely won't be recommending it to others."}
{"text":"We had a Restaurant.com gift certificate for Chop and Wok, so decided to give it a try.  Knowing that liking particular Chinese food is one of those very personal things, we usually don't go in with pre-disposed notions of what it will be like.  This was really excellent.  I must admit that the interior is absolutely nothing like any other Chinese restaurant I have ever experienced.  It is actually a bar that serves food.  It's décor is that of a bar.  It's ambience is, as well - especially with TV's abounding.  The menu is definitely Chinese and the food - well the food was really, really good.  We didn't order particularly well, however.  I ordered the Kun Pao Chicken and my wife ordered Almond Chicken.  The only difference between the two was that the Kun Pao was nicely hot and had peanuts (as it should), while the Almond Chicken was mild (no peppers) and had almonds (also as it should).  I believe the sauces were the same otherwise, and both had the same cuts of chicken and the same vegetables.  We will be back and will take care to order things that are obviously going to be different.  That aside, we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch - and the 31 beers on tap sure doesn't hurt anything.  The best treat was the service provided by Kasey (we had to ask her name as the ticket said, \"Server: Counter Day.\")  We were pretty sure that wasn't her name.  Kasey was pleasant, professional, and personable.  If you're lucky enough to get Kasey as your server, you will enjoy your meal all the more."}
{"text":"I'm from Michigan where I thought they only had the good Chinese food but this food here is great always hot and delicious"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place especially because I like supporting neighborhood restaurants instead of the big chains.  However, the food is just marginal.  The egg roll was so small, lacked flavor and was very mushy - perhaps it was a frozen variety?  The cashew chicken had very little chicken and cashews and way too many mushrooms.  The mongolian beef was okay, but not the best I've ever had.  Ordered the crispy honey chicken for the kiddos and it should have been called the mushy chicken.  I think if they would infuse some more flavor to their menu then this could be a great place."}
{"text":"Update review. Ordered delivery and wow I wish I didn't! I ordered a small Mongolian beef and it had 4 pieces of beef! Mostly water chestnuts and onions. Yuck! Asked them to make it EXTRA spicy and it was the most bland Chinese food I've ever had! Honestly that wasn't even Mongolian beef. It tasted like bland beef and broccoli except no broccoli and I must've ordered 90% vegetarian with water chestnuts and onion. I mean, if the vegetables were cooked it probably wouldn't have been AS bad but they were practically raw. Wow has this place gone down hill or what? I wrote a five star review last year and I cannot believe how much it has changed. I figured I would try my wonton soup. (Because how hard is it to F that up?) it was so salty and the wontons were mushy. I literally threw out all my food. I'm so disappointed I wasted 25 dollars for food so bad that went into the garbage. But now I'll safe my money by not going back. Cereal sounds better for a midnight craving lol. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow!! What a great place!  I stopped by to meet a friend on a Sunday night and was glad I did. Great draft beer selection, solid menu, but most importantly, the service was top notch. Erin the bartender made us feel welcome right out of the gate. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I usually order from another place but they don't deliever to my work place. I gave Chop Wok a try after a suggestion from a fellow employee.  I ordered 2 Shrimp Dishes.  Both I felt were disappointing and for what I payed I was expecting more. I got mostly a box full of veggies smothered in gravy  with 4 shrimp,  and a carton of overcooked noodles 3 shrimp and about 50 watercrests. ( not that I dont like them it's just it was almost all there was in the box with the noodles. )  I think from now on Ill stick to my local place instead and bring their food with me to work."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 dishes online, the dieter's chicken bowl and the vegetable lo mein. 28 dollars worth of what consisted of mostly plain brown rice and small serving of noodles. How can a \"chicken bowl\" consist of 3/4 of the plate filled with rice? Also the lo mein seemed to be a side dish with the price of a full meal! Will never order from this establishment again. Will stick to Yum Yum. Better prices and higher quality."}
{"text":"Heard a lot great things about this place, didn't live up to expectations. I would've liked the environment if I was going there for a couple beers and a game, but I was going for Chinese food. Place wasn't clean, our server was very nice and attentive, but food was unsatisfactory. I ordered shrimp fried rice, it seemed as if I got grits with undercooked shrimp. I'm not much of a picky eater, but couldn't stand to eat it. Server was gracious enough to comp the plate. For same amount I'd rather go to Pei Wei. Seems like a cool place for a drink and bar food, just not Chinese food."}
{"text":"YUCK, YUCK, YUCK!!!  Placed a $70 order for pick up and it was the MOST DISGUSTING food experience EVER!!!  The chicken was so dry and hard I'm quiet certain it was older than my deceased grandparents.  So inedible we had to spit out every other bite before throwing it out.  GROSS!!!  The beef was tougher than 100 year old beef jerky.  I swore I was punked and was actually chewing on a flip-flop.  Nope, no such luck, that would have tasted better.  All around it was nothing better than a NEGATIVE ----20 stars but sadly Yelp only goes as low as 1 star.  RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IF A.) YOU HAVE TASTE and B.) CARE ABOUT YOUR HEALTH, FRIENDS AND KEEPING YOUR FRIENDS.  TOTALLY DISGUSTED!!!!!!!!  :((("}
{"text":"This place is very dirty. My legs stuck to the booth that we sat in. You can just see the filth on the walls, around the air vents, on the floor, on the tables and silverware. The food was suspect too. The beef in the chow mein was highly questionable and tasted very odd. Do not use the restrooms there, just wow. The server was good but we were the only table there on a Saturday night. I am guessing because of how dirty it is. I can't even imagine what the back of the house looks like...."}
{"text":"I love this place for the food. Other than that it's a total dump. Guy Fieri would love this place. Like I said the foods great but other than that forget it.  The bartenders NEVER ask you if you need a refill and never ask you if you are ready to order.  The A/C sucks which in AZ IS REALLY important !  So buyer beware. Maybe get your order to go."}
{"text":"Eh, this place was just that. Eh, expecting real Chinese food. Don't come here. Definitely lots of frozen, hardly anything fresh. The name would have you think that it's kind of authentic, but the moment you get in here. It's kind of turned around. I'm not sure if it's a sports bar, chinesefood, surf bar, rock bar. Idk. Nothing seems uniform. The food was under seasoned and there wasn't even soy sauce containers, they were ketchup packets. Will not come here again."}
{"text":"Terrible Golden Tee machine.  Bad service. I was there for 2 games of GT (15 mins minimum) and not once did.someone come over to see if I wanted a drink. The bartender was too busy on his phone."}
{"text":"This is when I wish there was a 0 star option on yelp. Not only is the food nasty, but, whatever the estimated time of arrival is, double that, since thats when youll be receiving your order, if youre lucky. The delivery guy will assume an attitude of indifference and simply say \"busy night\" when you mention how late it is. Call to complain, and you will encounter confusion about who the \"manager\" is, then the bar tender will get on the phone, and tell you that hes the manager for \"times like this\" whatever that means. Oh, and no, he doesnt really give a damn that they sent you crappy food and made you wait well over an hour when youre only 3 blocks away, but he will offer you a free entree next time just to get you off the phone, as if you would want more of the same slop. Nothing about the food is good, not even the rice, it was a flavorless, sticky mess, with huge clumps in it, and the sweet and sour is cut worse than a drug dealer trying to turn a profit, just a watery red mess with NO flavor, its not even sweet! The people here should be ashamed to send out the slop they call food, I almost vomited on the horribly overcooked wantons that dissolved in my mouth no chewing needed. Needless to say, NEVER AGAIN, not even for free, THATS how bad this place is!"}
{"text":"This is frozen reheated Chinese at best. I can't believe other reviews saying it's the best Chinese they've ever had. I've had better Chinese samples at Costco. Nice atmosphere. Looks like a nice bar. Waitress was nice. Just don't eat the food."}
{"text":"We tried Chop and Wok for the first time on a Wednesday night.  It does have a dive bar sort of atmosphere but it was fun and lively.  Every employee we encountered was very friendly and a pleasure to deal with; they truly make you feel welcome.  That said the food was at best average.   We had two appetizers, the fried won tons (OK, but cooked to extra-extra-crispy) and jalapeno puffs that were good with a little kick.   Two of us had Chicken Kung Pao that had plenty of vegetables but was over saucy and blah, it needed more heat.   Another companion had Mongolian Beef that was really tough and hard to eat.  Over-all I hope things go well there, a good neighborhood feel.   I probably would explore other area options before going back."}
{"text":"First off, I never write reviews, but it was necessary for this place. If I could, I would have gave no stars! My husband got a Groupon and thought we would try another Chinese place. You walk in and wonder if this place is a Chinese restaurant or a bar? It's a bar that serves terrible Chinese food. I completely agree with Tom M. It was the WORST tasting Chinese food ever! The place is dirty and toilets don't flush. They tell you to seat yourself when you walk in. The waitress seemed like she was on drugs. We would ask about certain food and she didn't know what to say about it. There were 4 kids (about 10-12 years old) playing with the pool table and throwing darts and hitting everything but the dart board. The employees nor the parents cared that the kids were running around screaming and being obnoxious.   Now for the food, the only thing worth eating was the War Wonton soup. However, there was only three tasteless shrimps in two bowls of soup and we paid $10.00 for it. We got one order of Mongolian chicken. We usually get two when we go anywhere else, but since it was our first time there we decided to check it out first. We were so glad we did. It was so disgusting and where was the chicken? We got a heaping plate of onions and green chives. I had two bites and I was done. My husband looked for the chicken and ate the few pieces he found. I ordered two vegetarian egg/spring rolls. It was greasy and mushy on the inside. I had one bite and that was it. There was no filler like you would find in a regular egg roll. Oh, and the white rice. How can you go wrong with that???? Well, it was not like regular white rice. It was very small and sticky. I had maybe 5 bites. If you want soy sauce you can find the to-go packets. There is no bottle of soy sauce. We stuck with water, so that was safe...I think.  When we were ready to go, I had to find the waitress. She forgot to take the Groupon off the bill, so we had to wait for that too. We left hungry, disappointed, and with a stomachache. It's also not good if you have acid reflux.    So, if you want to go to a bar that looks scary and dirty, serves the worst Chinese food ever, gives you a stomachache, has horrible service and allows young kids to run around throwing darts and screaming, then this is the place to go!   What a waste of time and money. You couldn't pay me enough to go back there...EVER! We are sticking with Flo's!!!"}
{"text":"Great bar atmosphere with Chinese food! Good waitress but needed help with our large group! Food Ok!  Lots of beer selections!"}
{"text":"Worst service in the industry, the bartender guy can only handle one person at a time. Not worth it."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  I was there on Christmas day so the place was pretty packed.  They probably could have staffed it up a bit more but somehow that one gal made it work.  THanks for being open on the holiday.  We will be back.  The food was as delicious as it was in the 70's in the little hole in the wall on Shea."}
{"text":"I love this place and especially the fact that their kitchen is open until 2am!! The crab puffs are super yummy I get them every time I'm here. The decor is unique for a Chinese restaurant and I love it. The owners are awesome too! One is always behind the bar and he's really friendly. Thursday nights are stand up comedy and it's great."}
{"text":"I'm current visiting Scottsdale for spring break. This place is great place to hangout during the night. Service is so welcoming. Food is great! And the DJ here IS SICKK. DJ PsychoPAT, check him out and check this place out."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by here after doing some gun shopping in the area- The food was awesome and the atmosphere was interesting! The decor throughout the shop is super cool. I ordered the Crispy Honey Chicken lunch special- best fried rice I've ever had. The honey chicken was crispy and all white meat! Our server was super friendly as were the other staff who were chatted with momentarily. My only complaint was that my table was a little off-balance (but I fixed this by wadding up a napkin and putting it under one foot). I'd definitely recommend stopping by here if you're in the area and crave some good Chinese food or drinks."}
{"text":"I never went to the original location and finally had a chance to visit their new location today.  I found a great Groupon and took the family there to try it for our first time and were not disappointed. we ordered an enormous amount of food for less than $40 and had plenty to take home with us. vegetarian egg rolls and fried rice were killer.   The Groupon was for the Dynasty platter, which was 3 egg rolls, hot & sour soup, king pao chicken, orange chicken and egg fried rice which was enough for 4. we also got the Dan Dan noodles and yellow curry chicken. no complaints ts about the food except the soup was a little salty, but we still finished the whole bowl.  Service was great and friendly. I didn't know what to think about the decor, with surfboards and tropical fish hanging all over but that's the uniqueness of this place.... it's a place to drink and have Chinese food. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This bar is the perfect place to grab a drink and wind down after a long day. The food was pretty good and the drinks are very reasonably priced. A great neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"So happy to have wok back open! I often stop in for cocktails and it has such a great vibe. Jamie or Katie are usually there and always take good care of me! I love the egg rolls and house lo mein. I'm usually there for drinks but often get food delivered... And they deliver til 2am...Say what?!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Chop and Wok for several years, even before they moved locations. I am so glad their food has stayed amazing, as well as their entire vibe."}
{"text":"I like that Chop and Wok delivers till midnight. I don't like waiting 45 min to get the wrong item in my order, but accidents happen. What I can't forgive is then getting attitude from the delivery driver because I didn't want to keep the wrong order. He just scoffed, walked away, and didn't come back. He still kept the tip. Like I said, the worst part was his attitude."}
{"text":"Spent $60 tonight for chewy potstickers, awful gravy in cashew chicken, and gross lettuce cups.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Meh.  I wasn't impressed with the szechuan chicken I had here.  I thought it would be crispier like it usually is at other Chinese restaurants.  It's got a great atmosphere though and they're incredibly efficient."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery today and the food came extremely undercooked and cold.  Very disappointed with the food I received and it cost me 27 bucks! Would definitely like a refund because the meal was definitely below par.  Will not be returning to this place or be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I'd heard the stories.  But fire had consumed my dreams of Chop and Wok revelry.  Finally, they rebuilt and reopened.  Not long ago, I made my dreams reality. But it wasn't revelry, per se--simply shrimp lo mein at 1:30 a.m. in the morning.  Here's the long and the short of it. Any place that's open at 2:00 a.m. in the morning gets five stars to lose. The food was good, but not great ... still five stars because it's good food (specifically good enough shrimp lo mein) at 2:00 a.m. in the morning. The place is reasonably conveniently located, all good.  D'oh! It's overpriced. As much as I wanted to give it five stars, that dropped it down to four.  But I'll definitely go again if I'm hungry for Chinese food in the wee hours of the morning."}
{"text":"Never coming back here again. Terrible service.. Our waitress kept looking at us as she walked by in distance but wouldn't actually stop to ask us how we were doing."}
{"text":"Katie and I had a great lunch here.  The staff and even one of the owners cared that we had good food and good service -- Thanks!"}
{"text":"First of all Brad R left a very rude review!!! Grow up!!!  This is our place away from home the owner Jamie and his crew are always very welcoming. We've been going to chop wok since the old location. It's nice to be noticed that we are regulars and we appreciate the service and the very friendly staff. The food is great every time we go. The price is good and happy hour is even better. Give it a try for the food, friendly staff and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had delivery and it was fantastic.   Hot and sour soup, if that's your thing, was the best ever!"}
{"text":"Needs serious help with your menu contact me for some very easy proper Asian recipes I'm a chef and would like to help great decor great beer. You need to step it up in the kitchen."}
