{"text":"Had a great dinner here on Saturday night. My favorites were the fries and the Hawaiian Roll. The Salt and Pepper Mackerel was very good, and the Five mushroom tofu was excellent. Scott Kim runs a very nice restaurant, and we look forward to going there again soon!"}
{"text":"Good. Not great. Good decor. Average food. Business was slow, but so was the service."}
{"text":"I've been going out to eat at SASA ever since I could drive in high school. I love sushi and Japanese cuisine and SASA is one of my favorites for a couple different reasons. It is not the most gourmet or high class but I love the atmosphere, the style in which they cook and serve their dishes, and food quality and creativity are of the highest caliber.   SASA has a young slightly hipster vibe as the bar is clearly a centerpiece in the low light. The tables are simple and minimal and allow u to focus on your food and company. The sushi rolls alone are enough to make a trip to SASA, however I highly recommend starting off with some Nagiri or Sashimi to start. Everything is played beautifully and tastes DELICIOUS. There are so many different flavored and unique tastes to try. The only complaint I've ever really had is I wish more of their menu was spicy.   All said and done SASA is not fine dining but it is on the classier end of sushi. If your looking for a fun night out where you can enjoy a nice atmosphere without braking your wallet (or the $100 mark) then I highly recommend a night out at SASA."}
{"text":"Start with one of their great signature cocktails.  Mine is the Saketini.  The best thing on the menu is the Sasa fries with two dipping sauces.  The potatoes are amazingly crunchy on the outside and hot and almost puffed on the inside -  a winning texture combination.  On our most recent visit, that was the best part of the evening.  We had two noodle/salad entrees.  The tempura shrimp were served over generic greens and taste as if they came out of the freezer and were baked on a cookie sheet.  The noodle salad with scallops was equally bland.  The kitchen needs to work on the details, especially with such good alternative food options in Cleveland.  Service is polite, but average.  The bar had a busy vibe, which was nice."}
{"text":"Price is good but where are the flavors? Ion't taste anything. I had the shrimp & lobster egg rolls - barf. Like all I tasted was dough. The pork belly flat bread is a solid 7 though so not all is wasted. I am however plenty mad at the glass of wine being the same price as the bottle. But oh well. I'm here with my newborn FBF so we're happy."}
{"text":"Common American Japanese food. Nothing special,except the good location in shaker square"}
{"text":"Despite the mixed reviews my wife and I had a terrific time at Sasa. Our fears quickly subsided after our pleasant waiter brought us the fabulous Sasa fries and wine. The highlight of the evening was the vegetarian sushi wrapped in thinly sliced Dikon radish - superb! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I really really want to like this place. It's nice looking and really what we need around here. Too bad the sushi is garbage. Go here for a drink instead."}
{"text":"I ducked in one day because I had time to kill before a movie. Boy am I glad I did. I'm there 2-3 times a month now. If you only have time for an appetizer, get the french fries. They're the best in Cleveland...from a sushi place. (Figure that one out and you win a prize.)"}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant for a good variety of Japanese dishes. They have a large selection of sushi and saki. One of the unique dishes is the steak on a stone.  It sounds like what it is. You get a hot stone and you put slices of  steak on it. Basically, you cook the meat the way you want it.  Sushi rolls are very big. Not only alot of rice, but big pieces of fish. Prices are higher for quality. They just opened this year and there is always a lot of people inside."}
{"text":"On Wednesday March 23, 2016 I had the pleasure of trying SASA for the first time.  I have heard nothing but wonderful things about this place and after finally getting a chance to try it out I now know why.  This secert find is nestled up in Shaker Square with beautiful red (which is my favorite color) decorations along with the classic black and white.  I enjoyed that fact that it was late in the evening so I pretty much had the place to myself besides another couple that was also there.  I met the acquaintance of Eunice awesome bartender/server she took her time to explain the menu and more importantly the drinks.  I tried my first Japanese Vodka drink call the Lime Mizuari and it was fantabulous.  I recommend you stop in and try them out you won't be disappointed and ask for Eunice she ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Service: The service was great. Servers are good at explaining what everything is on the menu and making recommendations if it's your first time there. I do recommend making a reservation though, it's usually a long wait for walk-ins. Takeout is also an option.   Location: Great location, right in Shaker Square next to the movie theater. Perfect if you want to do dinner and a movie.   Must Try: SASA Fire Roll (you'll love it just for the presentation)   Summary: SASA is a nice spot. If you wanna try something new, or if you're already a fan of Japanese food, you'll like it. The basically have a menu full of appetizers, so be prepared to order multiple dishes. Good for a group or just 2. It's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"All the sushi rolls are great, cooked dinners are a bit on a salty side but still pretty good. One complain I have is how much they charge for a glass of Kimoto, for $9. At Pacific East, I can get the same sake for $8.5 a glass AND it's double the size!!"}
{"text":"The fries and saki. The sushi is a bit on the warm side for me. However I am an advocate for any Shaker Sq.  restaurant that has stood the test of time."}
{"text":"Fried wontons and pickle plate, along with flaming sushi. All good stuff.  I think the decor could improve, but overall a different experience than your average sushi place."}
{"text":"The food was good, the drink Special on Monday is HAPPY HOUR ALL DAY and the food comes as you order it, which I really like. The best however was the flaming stone dish that placed a hot stone on our table and cooked our own meat (can't complain about temps when its your own fault ). Yummy and trendy (and open Monday, my traditional day off)"}
{"text":"Our third and final stop on the Restaurant Week tour, brought us to SASAmatsu .....  One thing that stood out was the very good service we had here .....  The second was our flight of sake (this is a must try) ...... We have a nigiri sake (the sweet unfiltered sake, which is probably the sake for beginners :) ), fetish and this sake was not a disappointment.  Our food was also good.  Loved the SASA special role - didn't try any of the sashimi.  Cleveland sushi has traumatized me.  We did try the Japanese risotto, which was homestyle and satisfying, but I don't know that I would order this again .....  The scallops were very good ....  I will be back and will give their sashimi a chance!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Sasa friendly and welcoming. This place has one of the more extensive nishonshu  (Sake) menus in town, but be prepared to pay a premium for it-- even during happy hour, a small wine glass (~2oz) of lower-grade sake runs $5. Additionally, a more traditional sake cup, rather than a wine glass would have been a nice touch. However, the small plate menu is closer to a true izakaya-style (tapas) restaurant, with good variety and quality. The chicken kushiyaki were juicy and flavorful, and grilled to perfection. The oshinko (pickled vegetables) weren't bad, but a few were overly-sweet.  Overall enjoyable with good variety, but slightly over-priced."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall, bartender was brainless but the food was fine- just a little too hip for my taste- no problems"}
{"text":"Long time patron and from my first time the year they opened til now Scott maintains high quality delights! From kobi steak on a rock to delicious fresh prepared sushi to the umami of SASA appetizers- Ive never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The decor is nice, I love that they have a patio out front and the restaurant looks crisp and clean but the food was just okay. Our waitress was very nice and since we were new she did explain to us that the menu is more tapas style and the plates come out whenever they are ready. We ordered the Ramen, Calamari and two sushi rolls. The calamari was not good. There was entirely too much breading and that's all you could taste. The sushi rolls were okay but nothing to talk about. However, the Ramen was the saving grace and was by far the best thing we ordered. The broth had a great amount of flavor and kick. We could not stop eating it, in fact I would come back just for this dish only. Needless to say we were bummed about most of the food and that it was underwhelming."}
{"text":"Our waitress was wonderful and kind; we had a reservation, so we were seated promptly; the Vietnamese roll was very tasty; sasa fries were divine; lamb burgers were juicy; pot stickers were flavorful --great place"}
{"text":"Had a great meal but the service was lackluster. I do not enjoy getting all of my courses at once. Also, the drinks are a little weak."}
{"text":"Wow.. As good as it gets. I truly love this place. It's a little out of the way, but anytime I am in the area, I make my way to Sasa.  This restaurant is more Asian flare than straight up sushi. Regardless, whatever is ordered is always a tasty treat.   First, as a sushi lover.... The sushi is fresh and fabulous. This is a VERY vegetarian friendly place. They have edamame sliders! I mean....that is awesome since not many places accommodate people like me. There are other vegetarian sushi options as well. There is also a flaming sushi roll that arrives to the table on fire!  It has meat, so I haven't eaten it, but others tell me it's super good.   I understand that that this is a family owned business. The owner is also the chef and runs his restaurant. I prefer to patronize places like this. It always shows in the quality, which at Sasa is top notch.   Sasa is situated in Shaker Square, perfect before of after a movie.   P.S. You must try the Sasa Fries!"}
{"text":"First time dining here, and my only regret is not having been here sooner! This is a really trendy Japanese restaurant right next to the Shaker Square Cinema, which makes it a convenient location for a pre/post-movie dinner. You can make reservations through Opentable on their website, and parking is free if you park in the lot behind the Theatre and Daves Market.  I went here with a friend for a pre-movie dinner, and for drinks, we ordered the Traditional Sake tasting ($10 - great deal!) of 5 different cold Sake, ranging from very dry to very sweet. I'm no Sake expert, but it was a neat experience to sample out their selection of Sake. We also ordered the Tofu sliders and the Beef Brisket ramen. Both dishes were excellent and delicious! The creamy ramen broth was savory and spicy, and the noodles tasted very fresh. I wish it did have more slices of beef, especially since it is a bit pricy of a bowl ($14). However I still highly recommend trying out this ramen because it is so flavorful and filling.  Also the service was friendly and professional. Our waitress was very knowledgable of the menu and accommodating for food substitutions. They have so many dishes on their menu, so we look forward to returning here to try out more items, especially the sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great atmosphere, friendly greeting at the door, and a relaxing bar. We had a cocktail before dinner and never felt rushed. Even offered an appetizer at the bar pre dinner.   Sat down and were immediately attended to both with water and our server ready to take drink orders. I knew this server from other visits and she was extremely helpful and made suggestions for sake based on my previous visits.   Sasa fries were perfect as usual. This is an updated menu but we were able to do a bunch of different plates still. The Rock is a must and the ribs (3 varieties including lamb) were great. The cod Katsu was AWESOME!!!!!  I'll keep coming back as this is one of the best locations in shaker square. I'll get the Katsu for sure."}
{"text":"SASA is always on point. Some of the best sushi in town, phenomenal ramen, and deliciously authentic small plates. If you haven't had them, SASA Fries are game changers."}
{"text":"Ordered a sushi online which I have spent about $70 but two a la carte nigiri was missing so I had to call them back. They took an hour to get those two sushi delivered. And the sushi was delivered squeezed and delivering guy was giving me a uncomfortable look. Not worth a $70 cuz portion was not quite much."}
{"text":"Oh SASA, how I love you. You're barely a quarter mile away, provide me with consistently delicious food and drinks, and have great weeknight specials. If I weren't getting married... Okay. But seriously. Get the green dragon and the fire island rolls, some of their famous fries (yes, really: famous), a glass of wine or sake and enjoy. You won't get the world's best service, but it won't suck either. Some consistently great sushi is what you will get. I should know, I've been here at least twice a month for the past two years and I gave five stars."}
{"text":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izakaya  I got really excited when I saw the label \"Izakaya\" for Sasa Matsu.  Drinking and eating in an izakaya is a must... and if you ever get to wander over to Tokyo, Izakaya make up a large chunk of the 150,000 restaurants in Tokyo.  Just thinking of the numerous small plates that are available, spanning many types of flavours and cooking styles makes my mouth water.  I needed a fix to stave me over from missing the likes of Hashiguchi, Jr. in Atlanta...  So, I wandered in, perused (and I mean perused!) the menu for both Sake/Nihonshu as well as the food.  The extensive sake collection seemed to bode well - with a decent selection of Japanese beer.  The menu for food was less impressive.  Still, it was better than nothing... so, I ordered a smattering of choices:  Otoro sashimi Bluefin maguro nigiri Agedashi tofu Chicken kushiyaki Kalbi  And then I waited, quietly quaffing my sake, kanbara Junmai ginjyo, observing the waitstaff and chefs.  I ended up chatting with Mr. Chen, who worked at the Sushi Bar, who turned out to be cantonese.  So, apparently the original Matsu was opened by a Vietnamese entrepeneur, and the current owner is Korean.  There are no Japanese speaking staff, so far as I can tell, so if you're looking for a conversation in Nihon-go, this isn't the place.  Fish apparently comes either via Chicago (from Japan), or from Hawaii.  Mondays and Thursdays (mark your calendars).  Otoro sashimi:   I love O-toro.  I could go on about the virtues of this dish.  Today, market price was 18.50 for 2 pieces.  I gave it a shot and found relatively fresh flavour.  Tendon was prominent, however, making a rather strange sight, as the chef had decided to cut against the tendon grain, leaving a somewhat serrated appearance to the flesh.  Aesthetically unappealing, but reasonably tasty.  He noted that the Chu-toro was of better quality that day... alas I'd already made my bid.  The Gari was relatively standard.  I suspect purchased somewhere else, rather than pickled within the store.   Bluefin maguro nigiri.  Cutting was a little more traditional, though still a little rectangular for my tastes.  The rice was reasonablly seasoned; just a tad of vinegar.  The consistency was reasonable, and the interface between the fish and rice stayed solvent on its way to my lips.  :)  Agedashi tofu:  Variant dish.  This is far from the traditional breaded/fried tofu in Ponzu sauce with sake and bonito.  Their version included straw and Shimeji mushrooms on a highly fried breaded tofu with Gailan (Chinese broccoli) in a terriyaki sauce base with a dash of vinegar.  Quite different.  The overall effect isn't bad, but I do take a bit of issue with the rigidity of the Tofu skin.  It's too rigid.  I like good contrast between the skin and a soft interior, but there was nearly 2-3 mm of thickness here, surrounding the tofu.  Too much.  The sauce is also a little heavy handed -- much more appropriate to the Gailan than for the tofu.  Chicken kushiyaki - It's not yakitori taisho (NYC).  There's only 2 types of kushiyaki here.  Although I had a hard time getting one piece off the spit, it was pretty flavourful.  Not bad.  Beef short-ribs - This confused me.  Given a Korean owner, I expected a more Kalbi like formulation.  It's not.  This is more of a western or even chinese preparation, with the ribs cut into 7 mm thick segments in a cross sectional fashion, perpendicular to the primary axis of the rib.  Three rib-lets were left in place in the larger piece of beef.  Marination wasn't bad, but was not Kalbi.  Slightly sweet, tiny bit of pepper, probably a bit of soy.  It was paired with a pool of hot sauce that seems like concentrated sauce from an american bbq joint.  That was moderately spicy, not really sweet.  Kinda like spice extract.  There's quite a bit more on the menu.  It's not really a traditional place.  The spice selection and menu formulation isn't really Japanese in tradition.  This is probably better classified as fusion.  They do try to stay true to a couple concepts though:  This is a place you could drink a lot and eat decent food at the same time.  But without the Japanese Salaryman population to give it stability, it's no wonder that it's developed into more of a fusion cuisine with an emphasis on food fit for more local palates.  Side notes: Decor is 4/5; pleasing and unobtrusive.  It's modern asian fusion decor. Waitstaff was very friendly and chatty -- and relaxed.  The Sake was good.  It's my first go at Kanbara.  Not particularly floral warm and rounded in flavour to my tasting.  I prefer something a tiny bit crisper, but it's not bad.  Oh... Sake was served in a champagne glass (long flute style, as opposed to old-french wide lip style).  I miss boxes and traditional sake glasses. :/"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.75 - do try their appetizers and rolls.  After having Ginko, I can no longer give this place a 4 star. If only I reviewed this before having Ginko. Cost wise, it's really similar, well okay Ginko is still a bit more expansive. But now that I think about, the quality of the fish is just too different.  We got a chirashi bowl that just cost way too much in my opinion, but the fish quality wasn't anything special.  However, their rolls are pretty decent. Their specialty rolls are still pretty decent.  Unfortunately, I don't remember what we got as appetizers, but I do remember it being decent. I didn't try their fries, but based on the server's recommendation to our neighbors, their fries should be pretty good.  Also, we tried their sake sampler, that was pretty interesting since we got to try several different kind of sakes.  Again, this is another place that's worth trying once if you haven't been, but I don't know if I'll go back again anytime soon."}
{"text":"It was a pleasure eating at Sasa Matsu. My service was wonderful and the menu adventurous.  While Sasa offers a full sushi selection, the focus is on their tapas-style dishes organized as small, medium, and large on the menu. I highly recommend the scallops (medium). I also tried \"The Rock\" which was fun -- slivers of marinaded beef tenderloin are served with a hot rock for cooking.  The decor was simple and trendy with a few Asian accents."}
{"text":"Yum.  Good atmosphere: exudes warmth and cozy; intimate without being crowded/cramped; Enough ambient noise that you cannot hear outside conversations, but not so loud you have to strain to hear your partner. Good service: Friendly, efficient, effective. Good drinks: Japanese cream soda (novel and fun), Chai tea (fragrant, flavorful). Excellent food: Gyoza (crisp, succulent), Beef Yakitori (tender, delicious), Fries (crunchy, hot, tasty sauces), Hawaiian Rolls (generous, fresh, gobblesome)  Will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Just stopped here for drinks and enjoyed ourselves.I cant say anything about the food because I dont eat Sushi!!!"}
{"text":"The lamb ribs are amazing!  Just had to get that out there.    Sushi was pretty good.  Not the best I've ever had but it definitely hit the spot.   I'm not a sake fan so I don't have anything to say about but their wine list was LEGIT.  Overall, great ambiance, service was excellent and food was way above par.  Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood sushi place.  Decent selection of beer and wine.  But pretty impressive selection of sake. As far as the sushi goes - it's okay. Good, But nothing to rave about either.  If you're going to check this place out for the first time, go on a Wednesday for their \"I love sushi\" night with great specials."}
{"text":"Really unique food here. Not your typical Japanese sushi place. I got a salmon rice bowl and it was tasty and healthy. They always serve fresh fish here. Very good cocktails as well."}
{"text":"I haven't tried a whole lot of things off of the menu, but everything I had was great.  The SASA fries are a must!!!"}
{"text":"I had an awesome time at Sasa last Saturday night! They have happy hour on Saturday nights so my friends and I went a little early to sit at the bar. We sipped on some sake and had a few appetizers before ordering some tasty sushi. I'm Japanese so I will say it wasn't exactly \"authentic\" but it was delicious! It's in a great spot in Shake Heights and the atmosphere is very nice. I would definitely recommend Sasa for a fun dinner out!"}
{"text":"I was in the Shaker Square area during Happy Hour and thought that I would drop by SASA and give their offerings a try.   I went on a Tuesday afternoon and it was pretty empty upon arriving at approx 5:00, just 3-4 other people.   I ordered the cosmopolitan, SASA fries and the lamb sliders.  The cosmo, was just ok and the fries and sliders were pretty good.   I'm not sure that SASA would be my go-to restaurant.   The staff was too laid back for my taste.  There were lots of huddled conversations going on and also snacking in plain view of the customers.  The lamb sliders were well seasoned and topped with kimchi and served on bakery fresh buns.   The fries were also well seasoned, battered and then fried until crispy and golden, served with 2 dipping sauces.    The food  (4 stars) was definitely much better than the service (2 stars)."}
{"text":"We come to Sasa on a very regular basis at least once a month. The food is interesting and well prepared. I like all the cocktail choices. We are primarily vegan so we can find things on the menu to eat. After coming at least once a month for over four years, I have to say I am disappointed that management has never spoken to us or introduced themselves.  We love the fries, udon noodles, sushi."}
{"text":"First, the wait staff accidentally gave our table to someone else, but went out of their way to accommodate us and make sure we were comfortable which was awesome. The staff was very nice and friendly. Everything I had here was awesome. We got a few appetizers and some sushi rolls. the ONLY complaint I have is that the soy sauce was extremely salty. At first I thought it was the sushi that was bad but it was definitely the soy sauce I dipped it in. Definitely will come back again, I really like the variety on the menu."}
{"text":"SASA is one of those places that is underrated but still hasn't quite reached its full potential. The quality of the food is good, service is good, but the menu is just okay. Don't get me wrong, I dine here frequently, and will continue to, but SASA could be so much more if they would expand the menu and not just play it safe and remain complacent. The decor is beautiful, the cocktails are great too and the biggest benefit is they're open late. This could be one of, if not the best sushi restaurant in Cleveland if they wanted it to be."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Perfect sushi, creative, fun, delicious small plates. Contemporary yet relaxed atmosphere. Try: The Rock (rare beef that you cook yourself on a 400 degree stone); The herb-seasoned Fries served in a dumpling steamer; the \"Buddy Buddy\" maki; any of the perfectly executed nigiri. As of this review I've been to SaSa three times--and I plan to keep going back.  Update 5/7/08 -- Still my favorite. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that anyone who doesn't like this restaurant--well--their brain and taste buds just aren't connecting properly."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place !! Cool thoughtful bartenders,  good food, cool vibe, nice ambiance, but not too too formal or serious...I  almost forgot about t his place , me and my daughter use to visit every Monday before discount movie night, oh have I been reminded of how much I love this local place."}
{"text":"I can't believe we've lived here for a year and not yet been to Sasa. Sushi was absolutely fantastic. Great ambiance as well. Definitely the best sushi we've had since moving to the Cleveland area. We will definitely be back. Recommend the Sasa Fire."}
{"text":"Sasa came highly recommended by a friend. For our first few dishes, I can see why she said I had to eat here when visiting Cleveland. As the dinner rush took over though, I began to disagree.  Our server was polite but incompetent. As an out-of-towner I asked where the draft beer was from, and he didn't know-- or even offer to find out the information for me. Later on he was no where to be found for about 20 minutes. The manager must have picked up on our dismay and came to remedy the situation which we really appreciated. She brought us some desserts that were killer! Then another server dropped some plates on a table near by. It wasn't a good night for Sasa.  To be clear-- 95% of what I ate was beautiful and delicious. Loved the squid, and hawaiian roll. However the yellowtail sashimi I ordered was pallid in color and tasty a bit rancid. That combined with the awful service would prevent me from recommending this place to a friend."}
{"text":"This was our fourth trip to Sasa. The tapas are terrific, the modern atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the servers very attentive.  We have dietary restrictions (gluten issues), and the restaurant offers a decent selection to match our needs."}
{"text":"If your looking for Sushi on the east side Sasa should be a first pick. Its very nice inside and clean. The food is excellent and the seasoned fries are a unique twist. Its comparatively inexpensive too. Service is very attentive! Huge kudos there. The menu has a few featured delicacies as well."}
{"text":"Food was incredibly disappointing and when we sent a dish back, the manager came to our table and accused us!!!! Unbelievable! We were so mad that we left right away  even though we hardly ate at all and was still hungry. Portions are tiny and ordering a sushi roll + an appetizer and a beer cost us $40!   We had ordered SASA Fire roll, which was good, and then Salt and pepper Mackerel which came out lukewarm and shrimp Yaki-udon was terrible! First of all, the portion size was incredibly small. We were surprised as this was a main course. The dish was extremely salty as the noodles were soaked in sauce, which is not how a stir-fry noodle dish should be. When we sent it back to the kitchen and wanted to order something else instead, manager came to our table and first thing she said that because we had ate half the plate, she was going to charge us for it. Absolutely ridiculous! Portions are so small that even the manager though we had ate half of it! Hah! We had only tasted it and we immediately sent it back. Next she told us that the dish had too much sauce because we wanted to change the shrimp (food allergy) to chicken. That makes no sense, the problem was simply the dish was too salty because there was way too much sauce! She continued to imply it was our fault and she would have to inform the chef and \"see what can be done about it\" instead of apologizing for the terrible food.   We will never be back again. A restaurant should know how important good service is, and the way SASA's manager handled the situation tonight was just incredibly rude. I will not recommend anyone to come here for the mediocre food."}
{"text":"I've been going to Sasa for years. Service and food have always been consistent.   The newness has worn off for me, but I think if it's your first time here, you really appreciate that it's modern, trendy, clean, and exciting when you find your seat.   Service has always been outstanding; I've never had to send my food back.   I appreciate the extensive menu. And the happy hour tapas menu is great because you can try several things all at once and create your own feast. Which is exactly what my boyfriend and I did last time we came. The fact that the sushi/sashimi is outstanding, makes this a staple destination for me. But babe doesn't like fish. So, knowing that beef brisket sliders, Daikon wraps, and chicken clay pots are on the menu, let's other non - fish eaters know, they'll come and go extremely satisfied too!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese food I've had in Cleveland thus far - I had sashimi, sweet potato fries, and a poached pear.  Fun menu, great food, lively ambience.  All delicious.  I'll add my favorite dishes as I will undoubtedly continue to go."}
{"text":"i must either be feeling very generous tonight or sasamatsu really does have the best sushi in the cleveland area that i've tried at least so far.  in general the entire place doesn't seem like the typical japanese restaurant. it was like a little too nice. then the menu was very atypical, kind of americanized. which started making me skeptical about the kind of sushi i was about to order. needless to say, to my pleasant surprise and relief, the sushi looked SO good and it WAS so good and i am glad my friend didn't take me to pacific east!  one thing to note, it's pricey but i might just be willing to pay a little extra if i want good sushi."}
{"text":"We ordered udon and a \"Hawaiian\" roll. The udon was really bad with only really bad, yellowish veggies and very little mushroom in it., no meat at all. We are not vegetarian and we thought we could make much better udon ourselves...."}
{"text":"Had a great happy hour here with friends on Monday! Loved being able to sit at the tables with our group of four. The shrimp shumai is delicious! The plum pork ribs were also great! The Kobe beef gyoza was good--not noticeably better than normal dumplings though.   The edamame hummus was pretty good, great texture. The chicken clay hot pot was surprisingly French-inspired with a red wine sauce. A bit hard to share, but it had really nice deep flavors.   The SASA fries have two types of nori and two amazing sauces to boot! Great recommendation for a sharing app from our waitress!  The service was quick and friendly, and we had a great time! Definitely a perfect start to a dinner / movie combo at the Shaker Square theater next door!"}
{"text":"It's an act of trust and faith, eating sushi in the Midwest. While I can look out at a large body of water, it's not the same as being on one of the coasts, where I can at least have the illusion of my fish being pulled from the sea mere hours before it adorns my plate. And yet, I can't stop myself from trying, sometimes to not-very-good effect.  Sasa is a welcome success in the Midwest sushi quest. Settle into their welcome atmosphere, and you will quickly feel at home, thanks to the banter of the friendly staff. The menu makes good use of the types of fish available, with some imaginative rolls, and the kitchen will accommodate substitutions and special requests.  But before you get your fish on, be sure to have the fries. A strange specialty for a Japanese restaurant, they are some of the best fries in town, neck and neck with Lola fries for number one.  The sake menu is extensive, for those who drink it, and the appetizers quite tasty, particularly the lamb ribs. Definitely one of the best things about Shaker Square these days."}
{"text":"While this restaurant can get a bit loud and crowded, we have eaten here three times and the sushi and service has been very good.  The drinks are strong and tasty.  We had a roll on this past visit that was served in foil and set afire.  It was really delicious."}
{"text":"We were early for our blank panther show, so decided to grab a drink and some food.   The atmosphere was awesome, very elegant yet casual.   We ordered some drinks and sushi and it arrived quickly and tasted delicious. It was the fire roll. The tastes and crunch were perfect!  We also ordered a dessert that was rich but, perfectly paired with candied orange peal and some berries.   All in all it was a fantastic time. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Heading to Sasa again this evening for a big treat night. I always order miso soup, my favorites in ngiri sushi (salmon, yellowtail, mackerel, and salmon roe), and cold spinach salad. Really delicious and satisfying meal. I would have to say this really is my favorite restaurant in Shaker."}
{"text":"Service was okay, but had to move twice because of fruit flies. The problem can exist anywhere I understand but the owners wife said it was 'normal' and only comped two drinks on a $200 bill. Lost customer for life. Not worth it with the other restaurants in the area with similar menus."}
{"text":"Great food.  Good drinks.  Eclectic group of customers/patrons.  I am a fan of the sushi and small plate offerings."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the French fry appetizer, delicious tempura along with unusual dipping sauces round seemingly simple dish. The Tekka Tuna roll is spicy and delicious, everything I could ask for in a specialty roll. I will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I love Sasa! I never had anything bad and the service is always great. My 10 year son loves coming here, his favorite is the lamb ribs and SASA fries. I love everything I had from it. It's one of those places that I just bring my friends that haven't been before. There are a bunch of things in the menu that I haven't tried but will eventually.   The tempura shrimp, the shrimp kushiyahi, the inari sushi, the tofu sliders and the beef sliders and the donburi bowls! So good! All of them! But please try the toasted salmon skin and the cod donburi. You can even get the toasted salmon skin on a hand roll or sushi roll.   Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot!! It's Shaker Square location makes it the perfect drop thru spot on my way home! The happy hour prices and choices are superb.  Tonight, my hubby and I decided to stop by for a late supper.  We were greeted by a friendly host who sat us in a prime location to watch the Square activity outside.  Our server was prompt and cheerful despite the sucky weather outside.    We ordered 2 salads, a few of the standard rolls (that aren't on the menu btw but can be ordered like a California or Philadelphia) the plum bbq pork ribs and the harumaki lobster and shrimp rolls.  All freshly prepared with quality ingredients.    We didn't partake in any alcoholic beverages this time and stuck to the water.  At the end of our meal, our server was prompt with the check.  I couldn't locate my SASA loyalty card but she was able to locate me by name, even though I was under my maiden name, in their database.  You can accumulate points on the loyalty card and eventually earn free plates! Nice...right?!   So all in all...another great night at SASA's was had by the Savol's!"}
{"text":"I had one bad experience with them initially, but having gone back on multiple occasions have found them to be friendly, accommodating with great food and drinks!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo gooood!! Their kobe beef pot was awesome and their sushi never disappoints. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First sushi that I have had in Cleveland that I literally said \"yes, I would like to come back for more\". I am spoiled to have been living on the coast, SASA made me forget I was in Ohio. Their rolls, soups, and salads were creative and delicious.   pricing: their menu prices were a bit much, but the happy hour menu had plenty of drinks, soups, salads, and rolls to create a dinner at an affordable price point."}
{"text":"Only great thing about Yelp is that it lead me to SASA. Wow, this place is incredible! The music and atmosphere is just my kind of place!  I sat at the bar and was quickly greeted by a cute asian bartender (turns out she's the manager). She briefly explained their restaurant concept and \"izakaya\". We went through the menu together and decided I was having The Rock (where you cook your own meat on a hot rock), SASA fries and the Sake Salmon Roll.  The food was phenomenal!!!! And the service was OUTSTANDING. Through every course, she either switched out my old rock for a hot one, brought out extra dipping sauce for my fries and even switched out my dirty plates for new ones when my sushi arrived. She even poured my soy sauce in my soy sauce dish! Now that's what I call excellent service!!!   I hope to come back soon to try the rest of the items on the menu. Thank you SASA for the wonderful service and the yummy dinner. I'll be thinking about you guys until my next visit!!!!!"}
{"text":"Made an online reservation for a birthday and even mentioned it during dinner and it was ignored. Waitress was not very responsive and seem to have an attitude. Ordered a Mackerel entree and received what seemed like half a very small fish. Was hoping to be getting an entree not a piece of sushi. Sushi was good. Overall would not go back. Was not busy."}
{"text":"Good choice for a Japanese restaurant in Cleveland! It's  not a 5 stars because we have a lot of excellent Japanese restaurants in São Paulo (Brazil) may be I'm to critical.  But actually Sasa overdue my expectations. Thank you for the great dinner."}
{"text":"I think I might've found my new favorite restaurant! Every dish I ordered was better than the last. While their tea selection was not as big as I would have assumed, they had my favorite tea, jasmine green so I was pleased. The first thing I ordered, which was also my favorite, was the teriyaki shishito peppers. Shishito peppers are one of my favorite things to eat, and the peppers at Sasa were perfectly, simply cooked. I would eat them every day. The other star of the meal was the mushroom udon noodle soup. The broth was wonderfully developed, and chili flakes gave it even more depth. We also ordered \"the rock,\" which is thin slices of marinated beef that you cook at the table. The marinade was so flavorful, and at $15 it was a dish we couldn't pass up. We also indulged in the fries and the pork belly skewers. To complete the meal, I had their homemade green tea ice cream, which was fantastic. All in all, I'll definitely be back soon. A must try!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, if you know what to order.  We got a lot of different dishes to try out.  The grilled sampler was ok.  Not spectacular but it did allow us to try a good variety of their cooked dishes.  The fries were crispy and flavorful.  The real standouts here are the sushi items.  The rolls are made with some of the best sushi fish I've had here, and are packed with high quality ingredients.  They are expensive, but you do get what you pay for.  Service was good, fairly prompt despite us having a large party to tend to.  I'd like to go here on a Monday night sometime to try \"happy night\" where selected mixed drinks and all small plates are $5."}
{"text":"They've only been open a few weeks now, so this is really a placeholder to get SASAmatsu up on Yelp with some basic info. The chef/owner of Matsu on Chagrin has taken over the old Sushi on the Square space with what's supposed to be izakaya (Japanese drinking/snacking establishment) place.  After several visits, I'm upgrading SASAmatsu to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Such a nice and unique restaurant. The tapas are great and waiters are too. One of my favorite places in Cleveland and great place to visit on the eastside."}
{"text":"My husband and I both had to work night shift last Christmas and we wanted to celebrate a little together before going into work. SASA was open and it was a restaurant we've wanted to try for some time. SASA is surprisingly contemporary with almost house like music so be warned it is not your romantic date night hot spot (but definitely yes to birthday dinners and social gatherings and I guess romantic date nights if you're just that trendy). The wall art is beautiful and something to enjoy.  We ordered a myriad of appetizers and rolls which were all quite interesting and they all tasted good but maybe there was a little too much going on with each roll; too many ingredients to really enjoy any individual taste. But what a spectacle when the server came out and set our sushi on fire! Surrounding tables looked on while our sushi dish was cooked at tableside. It was a fun addition to dinner."}
{"text":"The concept is based off on a Japanese pub setting. It is located in the Shaker Square area. Plenty of parking is available both in front and back. The drinks menu is exhaustive, I settled for Sapporo which was available on draught. 2 of us shared 4 appetizers which are actually more than that. Korean Kalbi Short Ribs were my favorite, aah just an awesome preparation. Lamb sliders were perfect as well. Calamari was good as well. The rock was an intersting dish albeit in a different style where you have a 'hot rock' to cook the steak slices at your table. Our server's recommendations were right on the money. I am definitely going back.   Overall: A gem on the east side, different from the usual fare. Must try, will not be disappointed. A+"}
{"text":"For being a sushi place the sushi here was pretty disappointing. We tried three of the specialty rolls...fish was too fishy and not very fresh and the rolls fell apart while eating them.  And each roll was $15ish  Pros: service was great. Decor adorable and the small plates were pretty decent.  Would not come back here for the sushi tho."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Sasa for years every time I visit Cleveland. I am surprised I have not written a review. My favorites at this place is the fries and the Rock. The fries are crispy and comes with two sauces to choose from. It is served on an lightly fried edible wonton wrap. The Rock is an appetizer of marinated beef that comes raw that you will cook yourself on a rock. It cooks quick and when you bite into the beef it is tender and flavorful. The meat is delicious and melts in your mouth.      Some of the items on the menu are a hit or miss and I have tried a lot of items on the menu. I am not a fan of the pork belly flatbread. I like pork belly but Sasa's pork belly is too salty for me. My brother tried the ramen and he wasn't a fan of that menu item either. My mom had the beef sliders in the past which she seemed to like.       On this visit, we all had the speciality rolls which were eight big pieces and all of the rolls were pretty good. I liked my tuna confit roll  and fire island roll. The fire island roll had a nice spicy kick go it and filled me up. I also tried the sake flight. It's a good way to try the different sake. I now know I like the drier sakes than the sweet ones.  The reason why I gave Sasa four stars instead of five is the service. The service is pretty good in the beginning but at the end of the night my water needed refreshing and the waitress took awhile to come back."}
{"text":"SASA has nice atmosphere and decor, and great for small groups. The restaurant also is very accommodating for vegetarians.  I ordered the vegetarian specialty sushi roll. The sushi was overall pretty good, but it was nothing special, it could have been wrapped tighter, and the mango salsa on the side is hard to eat when eating with chop sticks.  If you come with an appetite, you will have to order something else if you want the specialty vegetarian roll. Fortunately you have a lot of options to choose from as a vegetarian."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about SASA- and people claiming it had the best sushi- a few friends and I went to SASA last night for a quick get-together and to celebrate restaurant week.  We went a little crazy and ordered a bunch of small and large plates off the menu. For the prices, I felt that SASA is a tad overpriced. Don't get me wrong, the decor and ambiance are great- a cool restaurant to just chill or bring a date (actually it's a great date place), but... in terms of catering to a foodie...it's ok.  My friend and I both ordered different teas. I ordered the ginger peach tea. Given, it's great, good quality tea... I wanted my tea..well, in tea form rather than a tea bag- given to me in a plastic wrap box which I had to open. Umm.. ok. (Other places, however, have given me actual tea bodum presses...)  The waiter seemed a tad distracted with everything- I kept trying to grab his attention, and he kept leaving the table before I could get my full order in. Nonetheless, it wasn't that big of a deal-   In terms of food (which is all we really care about, right?): Small plates: - SASA fries:- Mmmm. Potato-y fries seasoned well, with BBQ and another yellow sauce for dipping. Those were quite filling and tasty. - Shrimp Shumai- although they were tasty..they're definitely not shumai- which would be with pork. They were very very soft, and filled with shrimp..and maybe crabmeat? It was good- but a very deceiving name. Maybe it should be called a soft shrimp dumpling.  -Wonton Chips with Salsa- umm. Just deep fried wonton skins, and the salsa, wasn't really salsa...not spicy at all, and where was the pineapple in it? Nice presentation-but I was not impressed with the plate. -Some shrimp on skewers (maybe this was a medium plate)? -nonetheless, they were just that- 3 small shrimp on a skewer. Definitely not table worthy to share.  Medium plates: -Kalbi- definitely overpriced for the amount you get. It was seasoned ok.. -The Rock- kinda cool. The rock is a hot rock, which you can cook little pieces of meat on...but there's really not that much meat for the price you pay. -Panko soft shell crab- was kinda tough..and had too much panko on it.  -Sushi rolls: I can't remember which specialty roll we got, but it was good with fish roe on top. Not as nicely made, but it was a good taste. The SASA fire roll was cool to look at- they wrap the roll up in foil, then light 151, so the plate comes to you on fire...but the roll itself..is meh.  Desserts: -Brownie with green tea ice cream- kind of a flat brownie. I think it would be good if they made the brownie thicker and warm, and placed green tea on top with some type of chocolate shavings on top of it.. - Yam with pumpkin ice cream- that was actually really good. They carved out a yam, whipped it with pumpkin, then put pumpkin ice cream on top...Mmmmmm. That was a good dessert. Although, my friend happened to take all the ice cream in one spoonful, and we were just eating the yam at the end. haha.  So...SASA was alright... I wasn't really full at the end though... maybe I need to try the sake with the food next time or something...."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place in Cleveland to eat. It had great drinks, great service and great food. Their pumpkin spice martini is my favorite and every sushi roll is phenomenal. For their price, they are extremely generous."}
{"text":"I ate here with a friend based on a suggestion that SASA has the best sushi in town. I have to say that the Sushi was by no means bad, just not the best I have had in Cleveland. I went during happy hour and I would suggest that anyone looking to try SASA do the same. You have to sit at the bar for happy hour, but there are a number of great $5 appetizers. Depending on the night there are also a number of other good deals on food and drinks. Parking can also be a challenge in Shake Square, make sure to bring change!  When we walked in the host seemed a little confused when we asked a few questions about happy hour, she did check with the manager, but still didn't seemed to not know what she was doing. After we were seated service was good overall.  We had the Green Dragon, Double Double, and Buddy Buddy - all were good. For two people with drinks, appetizers, sushi rolls, and Nigiri it was right around $100.  I was not blown away by SASA, but I would definitely go back to for happy hour."}
{"text":"SASA is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. Located in lively Shaker Square, their seating outside is cool. Appetizers like their salad, soup and calamari are must haves...and the SASA fries oh man. For dinner, see picture attached because it's my meal every time I visit:"}
{"text":"If I don't eat here once a week, I crave it! I love their sushi, and try to come on Wednesdays (sushi night). If you come, you have to try the fries. You also can't go wrong with \"the rock\". Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I struggle with this review. The food was outstanding but the menu was overwhelming making it very hard to pick what to order. The sake listing was enormous and the owner was helpful in finding us the right ones to match our tastes. But the menu had so much - I thought it was mainly sushi - but it had sliders and flatbreads. Again food and service was outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"Sasa was a bit of a disappointment. I cannot fault the wait staff: they were very attentive. I simply did not like the food. I sat there eating tasteless japanese-style food thinking about the delicious Asian fare I've had in San Francisco. Granted, Cleveland is not the Pacific coast. But somehow I think this menu needs improvement. Maybe hire a new chef! The exorbitant price tag, $250 for six with no alcoholic beverages, added insult to injury. :-)"}
{"text":"Whoa! Where has this place been all my life? First visit. Won't be my last. My tofu stew alone was to die for, but when I tasted the Sasa Fries, I died and then rose from the dead so I could have more fries. They're the best I've ever had. And the service -- so welcoming and kind. I only wish Sasa could open for lunch on Saturdays and for dinner earlier than 5 on Sundays, to better accommodate the dining-out habits of my partner and me. We'll just have to work with their schedule. Did I mention how great the fries are?"}
{"text":"Fun fun fun restaurant.  The sushi I had was excellent, I only tried one roll so I can't really say how it compares to any other sushi restaurants I've been to but if I had to judge on the one roll I did have it would be near the top.  One plate I'd definitely suggest is \"The Rock\", they bring out marinated pieces of raw steak that you cook on a super hot rock.  I believe the rock flames when they bring it out.  While it might not be the best item on the menu it is still very good and its also the most fun.  As with anywhere else you will find some hit or miss items. I highly recommend also the Sasa fries, they might not be for everyone but they had a great texture and consistency nice and crispy yet soft on the inside.  The seaweed seasoning is just something that you have to experience to understand, don't let it scare you away though its good.  I actually wasn't a big fan of the Katsu ketchup they served with it though, I felt the fries were better plain.  Based on my first visit I'd definitely go back, hopefully get to try more sushi and get a better idea about whether I can keep it up at 5 stars or bring it down to four.  Its probably best for group dining or a date with someone who has similar tastes since after all tapas are meant for sharing."}
{"text":"Sasa has to to one of my favorite restaurants here in the city. First, the atmosphere is exceptional and the whole place reminds me and my family of a really great New York City bar. If you are a fan of sushi, this is the place to go. For me, the salmon, Ika squid, and the Ebi shrimp are the best things on the menu. The portions are great and if you add in a specialty sushi roll--Scandinavian roll and White Spider Web--are the favorites in our family, you have the perfect meal that is brimming with flavor and exploding with umami. As for the service, it is impeccable and each server I have ever had is spot on with the menu and making sure you are taken care of in the most professional manner. Additionally, the prices are not too pricey for such an exceptional meal. If you like sushi and love an uptown atmosphere, this is the place to eat."}
{"text":"Dinner was excellent and unique! I loved the menu. The service was fantastic. It was so much fun to order multiple small plates. This is a great place for a relaxed meal!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience here. Pros:... Cons:  -Our waitress smelled.  I'm sorry to say it but she had terrible BO.  -The miso soup was screaming hot, like out of a microwave hot and it burned my mouth -Before we even had 2 bites of out appetizers, our entrees were brought out -I had \"sushi\" and it was so poorly constructed that I couldn't pick it up with chopsticks, the slices were of such different thicknesses that it looked like a joke -Before we were halfway through our entrees, the check was brought out, waitress never asked how this were or if we'd like anything else. -Not plates were ever cleared P.S. the restaurant wasn't busy and I was there on an anniversary date"}
{"text":"Great sushi! There are a lot of options and had really great happy hour (especially Mondays). Service was a little slow but overall it was really good, I would definitely go back!"}
