{"text":"Stumbled upon this spot for lunch but as I was approaching the booth, the employee (looked like the manager but young) at the front came up to my face and started bombarding me with questions. I like to read the menu at any food establishment I go to before I order but she didn't let me do that without her spiel (seemed very memorized and unoriginal). Ordered anyway and got the Lebanese tacos which were just okay (hard flatbread and bland taste). Was still hungry so went to the next booth (Ramen Isshin) and their ramen was superb along with fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Assembly Chef Hall is a hip food court opened in the PATH featuring over 17 fancy food booths.  For foodie who wants good food, this food court has a wide variety of tasty options.

I was intrigued by Reyna . This food booth is serving the best and affordable Mediterranean dishes.  And they always served with a smile.  The staff were very helpful with the ingredient and recommendation. 

I ordered the combo w/ Lebanese Taco, Lamb Baklava and Reyna salad.  Lebanese taco tasted awesome.  The shredded chicken is recommended.  They were juicy.  They used the soft flatbread as taco shell.  Lamb Baklava was my favourite.  Lamb was super flavourful, slight gamy and earth taste.  I personally really like they put pistachios on top of lamb bc the nuts added the richness and savoury and slight sweetness taste to the meat.  Reyna salad was tons of veggies topped with tahini dressing.  I love tahini.  It gave sesame yet slight garlicky taste to the salad.

I highly recommend this food booth.  Thanks @barreynato for the superb service and excellent food experience.  Can't wait to come back to try other food vendors."}
{"text":"First things first: love the Assembly Hall! It is such cool concept and the vibe is killer!

Came in for drinks with some friends and stumbled upon this hidden gem. The food is delicious. My personal favourite is the taco with a lettuce wrap!

The staff - Aaron and Tom - were super helpful with my allergies (gluten intolerant).

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Assembly Food Hall and could not see Bar Reyna and not try their food. Left a little disappointed.
Lamb Baklava ($4.99) was REALLY good. 
Lamb Pide ($14.99) was extremely salty. Me and my friend weren't able to even have two bites of it.... at the same time it barely had few pieces of lamb, it was just an overpriced bread with a touch of lamb
Service was good. But would only recommend having the baklava here."}
{"text":"I recently went to the assembly hall yesterday for the first time march 7th around 6 for dinner i was supper excited to see that reyna was there as ive been to the restaurant before .... as i went up to the booth there was two girl at the cash, chatting away ( also on their phones) not paying attention to me. I found it very unprofessional also the girls were not put together very young and careless. On the positive side i had the two chicken tacos and loved it dearly"}
{"text":"Lamb (halal) Baklava, glazed with oooye goooyee goodness and pistachios.... YES what a cluster F$&k!!

So these guys here managed to put a lamb in the middle of a sweet dish Baklava which in return infused in my mouth all kinds of sweet and savoury smacks! Under $5.00 a must try even if you're not getting anything else!

Bravo for amusing our tastebuds ;-)"}
{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous mural at their stall but absolutely disappointing food.

I shared the trio tasting platter ($16.99 I think) which came with the Reyna Salad + Lebanese Tacos (we paid extra $ for chicken & falafel) + Lamb Baklava.

Reyna Salad: Bland AF! It was like eating raw cabbage and radish. Where the flavour at? Where the dressing at?!

Lebanese Tacos: They recommended the chicken, which my friend had, but I had the falafel so I can't comment on the chicken. BUT the housemade flatbread used as the taco shell must've been the same...it was COLD (like came outta the fridge cold) and crumbly nasty. Flavour was OK.

Lamb Baklava: Mindf*ck because we left it to the end of meal thinking it was baklava for dessert... nope. It looks like a really pretty nest baklava with sweet pistachio on top but it is actually savoury with pulled lamb in the middle. The lamb was pretty good but the green pistachio looking syrup on top tasted kinda weird. It was also COLD.

They didn't look like they had a proper kitchen set up and everything were in a container so my mistake for picking this place! I'll give them benefit of doubt for this but I will not return especially at their price point."}
{"text":"Loved the lamb baklava and tacos! Really yummy and tasty food. Great addition to the Assembly Chef Hall!"}
