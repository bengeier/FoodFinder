{"text":"The owners here are wonderful and kind, always feel welcomed. I stop by for lunch here about once a week, the lunch special is a great deal and generous portions. I always forget to take pictures of the food so I will update this review the next time I am back. If you ever get a chance to try their lollipop chicken as well, it is excellent. Hidden gem in Ajax/Durham region."}
