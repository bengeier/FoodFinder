{"text":"We went there because we were in the area with the Entertainment Book.  When the server saw us with the coupon, she came to us with an attitude.  We hadn't used such a coupon before and it only specified \"dinner buffet excluded\".  So when we tried to order items from their \"Specials\" menu, both servers were almost rude to us, saying we couldn't order from there with the coupon.  Now do you put yourself in a coupon book and expecting no one to use it?!  That coupon was the reason we stopped by in the first place!!

Food was so so, but given the service,  never again!!"}
{"text":"If you come from a home where your mom made great and endless Chinese food dishes, then firstly I've gotta say that I'm envious, secondly I'd say that you'll surely feel right at home at the Home Food Inn. 
Their weeknight buffet has over 60 items to choose from, and the $15.95 it costs is sure to seem reasonable when you consider how big of a feed you're getting. They have a variety of soups and sweets available, but I did the lion's share of my damage at the ginger beef and honey & garlic ribs trays. The ginger beef was lean and well seasoned with a hint of spicy goodness, and the honey & garlic ribs were sticky sweet and garlicky good. 
I wish I could say more about the rest of the enticing looking offerings, but I was on a strict \"carnivore cruise\" when I visited! 
The service was courteous and efficient - no embarrassing stacks of plates were allowed to accumulate, and I left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Yup, it is now official. This place is permanently closed. Good riddance. Rumor from ex staff is that it will be re=opened as a Japanese Restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for the buffet and it was... interesting. Hit and miss you could say, and to the extreme. The good food was fantastic and bad food was rancid. I've never had a bad wonton soup before. I didn't know you could screw it up, but it was awful.

That said, the shrimp, beef and many other items were excellent so it was a weird experience to say the least. 3 out of 5 rating is the average of the 5 for some items and 1 for others. Probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Buffets for me are like an ex-girlfriend. Everytime you run into them, you're never sure what to expect. Home Food Inn used to be the kind of place that had some sort of consistency to it, an important quality when one wants to drop by for something familiar and quick. Once in a while, I do get a little nostalgic and opt for some Western style Chinese fare. There's always something good about a crispy ginger beef or a fresh batch of salt and pepper squid. Don't forget about that dayglo orange sweet and sour pork or the lemon chicken sauce that you can use to signal passing planes.

Home Food used to be that place, but on my most recent visit, I was sadly disappointed. Though I do like the manageable size of the buffet and the choices are plentiful enough, a lot of the items seem to have that signature show of age when they've been on the steam table too long. Yes, there are popular items that do get refilled in a timely manner, but it seems that the other items get neglected. As a result, you get food that looks old and stuck to the insert - not too nice.

The stars of Home Food Inn still shine though. The ginger beef and salt and pepper squid are still the best items on the buffet. Looking at the soups, the wonton soup is a simple Asian broth with a few wontons having a swim, much like the swimming pool at a Holiday Inn just before it closes. The hot and sour soup looks interesting with all the various ingredients like the slivered tofu and wood ear mushroom, but the texture takes over the dish with its heavy use of cornstarch.

Another one of my favourite items is beef chow fun, and Home Food's is not bad. Those chewy rice ribbons and tender beef are a nice contrast to the crunch of the sprouts. Wonderful.

I really hope that things improve there soon, as I know that you've done better."}
{"text":"Good place for Chinese AYCE and soup Noodles. Solid and reliable in a city where decent Chinese is very difficult to come by."}
{"text":"Went in on a sunday at 12:30, buffet was on but dishes looked tired and not fresh, about 20 people in a room for 60 +?

Walked in, not sure if I was to wait or be seated or not, no sign no person, after about 5 minutes I made contact and someone came over and sat me and brought tea. 

I ordered hot & sour soup and pork and shezuan cabbage noodles with chinese tea as a beverage, they tried to \"upsale\" me to a smoothy (with chinese food?) then after 50 minutes and only the tea had arrived and no one else came out of the kitchen I gave up and left

If you want a buffet go for it if you are not worried about freshness and only want volume. I will go further downtown I guess....sigh"}
{"text":"yes, a very high rating for a chinese resto, in particular a buffet since i'm not a fan of it even back home.  Unless we're talking about Vegas lol.

The food's alright, i didn't expect much though the selection's there, anything you can think of.

but what impressed me the most was the decorative style; the bridge entrance from the lobby to the main eating area, even w/ water under too.  And the various huge vases, a few buddhist artwork.  yes, it's a throwback to the dynasty days, even with the mouldings too.

definitely a great place w/ casual friends, lots of space, and casual atmosphere.

{"text":"Man I love Filipino parties, I love the chaos and the silly chismis (gossip), the bad karaoke but most of all I love the food.

Usually at Filipino parties that I venture everyone cooks, we bring our platters and then we all dive in, but at Liza's birthday party I went to on Saturday, it had a different slant in that it was catered by a Chinese restaurant.

I was introducing myself with people but in my periphery I had my eye on the food.  I know it is rude but I have perfected this socialization skill so that people don't notice. The presentation of the 10 uniform pans and the smell was way too distracting.

Caterer of choice today at Liza's birthday was Home Food Inn Peking Cuisine.  There were 10 large pans all lined up on the food table, about 10 by 14 inches, and all were brimming with oriental goodness.
Sweet and Sour Pork, Ginger Grade A Beef, Pineapple Sweet and Sour Chicken, Salt and Pepper Squid, Honey and Garlic Ribs, Beef and Broccoli just to name a few.

Highlights for me this evening was the Salt and Pepper Squid; these are large squid portions deep-fried just perfectly with a hint of pepper, you couldn't taste the salt and served with red onion and of course the Pineapple Sweet and Sour Chicken which were also larger portions accompanied with diced carrots, the pineapple not to sweet but blended tastefully with the sour of the carrots.

Liza told me that each pan serves approximately 10 people and vary in price from 32 to 39 dollars.  . She also informed me that if you do order quite a large number of entrees they will give you a deal and deliver it to your party free of charge. Nice one Home Food Inn!

Not bad, so around $350 for 40 guests that showed up that evening, and there was still tons of food left over.  And you know Filipinos love leftovers so the crowd was just overjoyed.  

It really makes up for the next stage that every Filipino party has and one that I consistently have to endure ... the Karaoke.  But as much as I resist this cultural ritual I notice I am usually the one handling the mike at the end of the evening."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Homefood Inn since I was a lot younger. The first thing I ever tried was their lunch boxes. The value is wicked awesome. You get enough food for two meals, a drink, and it's super cheap. If you prefer dining in, their buffet offers an awesome variety and probably the best salt & pepper squid in the city. On weekends they even offer dim sum. Why the 3 star rating you may ask? Even though the value is awesome, asides from the squid everything else is very greasy and can be found better elsewhere. I have had a couple of experiences food-wise that lower their rating considerably.

{"text":"This place is considered to be a generational place, the chinese resto that your parents went to when they dated and so on.  Rumoured to be the creator of Ginger Beef (Silver Inn is the other place...but both places are owned by feuding family apparently), it specializes in cantonese and \"american chinese\" food (the kind that you traditionally would get as take out). It's also one of those places that has always looks the same as when your parents went to as well and a little too dark and run down.  It looks dated, like what fancy chinese restos wanted to look like back in the 70s, with a cute little mini bridge with some fish and turtles underneath, and a fair amount of ming and buddist designs here and there, which makes me wonder how it was in it's early years.

Still, with all that, it's not a bad place to eat though the quality is of maddening levels.  There's the All you can eat buffet every day with a few special themes.  In the day, there's the usual assortment of \"American Chinese\" and Dim Sum items.  I personally stick to the Dim Sum as the other stuff are mostly fried heavy foods.  And then at night, it's entirely a mix of the usual familiar noodles, stewed meats and so on, with dessert and so on.  Of especial note, weekends is Prime RIb and Seafood night which I've yet to try.  A word to the wise, if you're going to eat this, try and get there around 6 and not much later.  While they do replenish the buffet, around 5:30-6pm is when they first open it and the food is at their freshest then.  Otherwise, I would say that the buffet would rate around 2.5 to 3 stars (primarily the dim sum items) as the fried items are just heavy and greasy, but the steamed items are pretty decent.

However, the food is much better when ordered a la carte, around the same as most restos in chinatown (though not as good as say Regency or Silver Dragon).  There's an extensive menu for that, and the choices are quite varied.  I would rate it around 3.5 stars when a la carte, as it is freshly made as opposed to somethng under a heat lamp for hours.  My guess why it's not better is simply the focus on keeping the buffet filled and the take out orders.  Still, it's great for a snack or dinner, especially M-F in the afternoons when they offer a 20% discount for their version of afternoon tea.  

Finally, there's a great lunch box deal for $6.50 every day.  It's a LOT of food, and usually more than I can eat myself (though I noticed they no longer offer the fried dumpling to top it off).  I pick it up every once and awhile, as it's willed with noodles, rice, a fried spring roll and your choice of 2 of a list of items.  

Overall, I'm not sure how to rate this.  If inexpensive chinese food is the goal with no concern for decor, then this is as a good a place as any.  However, if atmosphere is part of the experience for you, there are better places in town.  Still, the lunch box deal is always a winner (extra $1 if you want the lunch box at dinner time)."}
