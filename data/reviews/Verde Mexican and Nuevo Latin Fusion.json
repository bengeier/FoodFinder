{"text":"Verde is simply amazing. The Latin fusion with the Mexican cuisine is a brilliant idea. I love the nachos Verde and the pobellon criollo. The black beans, shredded beef and plantain remind me of Cuban flavors I had growing up. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food here was okay but the service was poor at best.  While sitting trying to eat on a windy day I had to get up 4 times to close the door because it was so cold and the staff was oblivious to it.  When I pointed out that I had interrupted my meal 4x to close the door and would they please watch for the door they acted as if I was putting them out.  A customer walked into the restaurant with a small dog in her arms - we asked the pet policy and the server said people can eat on the patio with a dog.  We told him the customer was in the restaurant sitting with a dog and he said \"ok... Do you want to go talk with her?\"  Once again put out by us asking him to do his job.  I will never return."}
{"text":"So good. Best description is Mexican Fusion and maybe little farther down the SA continent like  Brazilian and Argentinian dishes. When my sister and bro in law come in for visit, they want to go to Verde. And they have dined all over the world. I always order off the appetizer selection and get plenty full. Love this place."}
{"text":"this place was awesome.....had a groupon and tried this place for first time.. it was awesome.  atmosphere, service, presentation, food, etc.. best nachos i ever had.....my brazilian seafood dish was great as well.  i will be back with or without a groupon."}
{"text":"We decided on Mexican, and wanted to try a new place, so we drove down the street to Verde. I used to work in Mooresville and have eaten at the Prickly Pear several times and thought the food and service was fantastic. Boy, was I disappointed with Verde. We got there after the dinner crowd, about 7:30PM on a Tuesday. We opted to sit at the bar. There were about 4 servers gathered around one of the tables at the bar chatting. We got settled, started looking over the menu and waited to be greeted. No one did. They kept chatting. My husband got up to go the restroom. No one had even come behind the bar before he returned. After about 10 minutes, a female server came behind the bar and glanced our way before grabbing a stack of plates. She asked if we had been helped, we said no. She took our drink orders while the group of servers continued to chat away right behind us. Got our drinks, they were okay, standard pour, nothing special. At that point we decided to order some apps, and make a decision on ordering dinner later. I\"m glad we did. Ordered the ceviche and guacamole. The ceviche presentation was impressive, however, there was so much stuff on top of it, strips of mango and something I wasn't able to identify, it was very difficult to eat. I expected more than just a few overcooked, rubbery shrimp swimming in some bland salsa. The guacamole had little flavor and did not taste very fresh. Tortilla chips were blah. No one came behind the bar, let alone to check on us, at any time. When we finally saw the female server who originally took our drink order, we asked for the check. Of course, that was brought promptly. We finished our drinks and stood to leave as one of the chatty servers asked us if there was a problem. At that point, we were ready to go, simply said no, we're done, and left. Headed to Taxco, where we were greeted like family, immediately served their wonderful chips, queso, and salsa, and ordered 2 fantastic dinners and another round of drinks. The bill at Taxco was less than the 2 drinks and 2 apps at Verde.  I know where we'll be going the next time the Mexican craving hits."}
{"text":"Having become a regular since my first review, and seeing such a divergence of opinions since, I write to offer this advice:  If you are looking to take the family out for tacos burritos etc., go to Unica at Exit 25.  If, on the other hand, you are interested in fine dining that draws on Mexican flavors, this is an excellent choice.  The menu is inventive, the specials are always creative, the food is always well prepared and from fresh ingredients, and the service is friendly and efficient.  I am leaving my original review, posted soon after the restaurant opened, intact, but since that time I have tried a great many items on the menu, and I have yet to be disappointed.  ****** The food here is nothing short of exquisite.  \"Mexican inspired\" would be a better description, I think, than \"urban Mexican,\" because this certainly is not food one would expect to find in Mexico City.  I had a deep fried catfish (fish special), for example, and I wish I could report on all of the ingredients, or even remember the waiter's description, but the fish was expertly fried, the batter had some flavor and some heat, and it was served in a thick bechamel sauce with spinach, mushrooms, and jalapenos.  The dish was excellent.  The space does not look special.  In fact it still looks like Just Fresh, the original tenant, despite the damage Friendly's did to the space.  The service was prompt but not special.  But despite those, the food still is good enough for five stars.  We also had the sangria blanco, and the reviewer who complained there were only four glasses in it is lying.  There were six large glasses in it, it featured white wine and tequila, and it was as good as I have had anywhere.  It is a shame when a new restaurant opens to see competitors posting anonymously on Yelp to trash it and employees responding with raves.  This place is excellent, and as a Huntersville resident, I hope it thrives."}
{"text":"I am surprised there was no line wrapped around the door! Phenomenal menu selection. Great waitresses and waiters. I went after work and was greeted by an enthusiastic young lady who asked my preference bar or booth at which i chose the bar. I ordered a quesadilla which when it cane...OMG...under promised and OVER DELIVERED. The bartender was well versed and gave me a sample of beers. The environment was calm,mellow and distinctly grown and latinesque. I recommend this place to ANYONE who has never had Latin fusion. Today was my first time & il be back!"}
{"text":"A fun spot to stop for drinks after dinner.  Margarita flights are a must!  The courteous and attentive staff seems happy about everything!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. Not traditional Mexican cuisine that I am used to, and prefer. A bit pricey as well...$69 for 3 entrees and 3 draft beers. I hate to say but my family will probably not go back here."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the negative reviews posted for Verde, but of course food is a very personal thing. I find the service at Verde to be just average, but the food is the best Mexican cuisine by far in the Huntersville area. Yes, compared to the \"typical\" Mexican restaurant the entrees are more costly, but well worth the premium. If it's inexpensive, heavy enchiladas and red sauce you crave, this is not the place. Highly recommended experience."}
{"text":"Not the food or flavor that I or my family enjoy. Where are any traditional items?  Huntersville is a suburb full of families and kids.  I can't get my family to eat there.  I recommend taking a lesson from your other locations.  I really hope this location is successful though. I'd just recommend simplifying the menu.  Your target market isn't The crowd at The Trump's Point Club. Burrito Loco rocks!  Great food and team in Mooresville."}
{"text":"The server did  a good job but the steak I ordered was burnt. When the server told the chef he said they were grill marks. Grill marks don't make a steak inedible as this was.and the whole thing was returned. I guess the customer is not always right even we are paying for it. Disappointed. ..."}
{"text":"I can add it to the list; this is now one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Charlotte! The food, drinks and service are fabulous! The drinks are creative and well executed. My friend had the daily $5 drink special: the flavor of the day was a jalapeño margarita. I had the mango margarita which was amazing; I love the depth of flavor. These are some of the best margaritas I've ever had. They use fresh ingredients and it really makes a difference.  We started with the fresh table side guacamole and it too was delicious. It was very fresh and flavorful. It was so good that I scraped the bottom of the bowl. So far, it's the best table-side guacamole that I've had in Charlotte.  For dinner I had the shrimp ceviche, which is really an appetizer. It was light and refreshing. The flavor was just okay.  But  my friend let me taste some of her enchiladas suizas. It was excellent. The chicken was sooo flavorful.   For dessert we split the cajeta creme brûlée. It was good, but we really wanted the tres leches cake. However they were sold out; the chef only makes a limited number per day. Lesson learned: go earlier next time.   This place was great! Kudos to the chef. The food is fresh and flavorful. It's not your average Americanized Mexican restaurant. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"The food at Verde is excellent. The dishes are presented beautifully as well. We've eaten there for lunch quite a few times and watched college games in the bar area once. The only warning I would give and the reason for the missing 5th star, is  that if you substitute Gran Marnier for Triple Sec in the house margarita, get ready for a $6 upcharge."}
{"text":"Very clean environment and friendly staff but food is just ok. I got the steak fajitas and it was very tough. So tough it wouldn't break off when eating it on a flour tortilla. I went with another person and her meal was very ok.   Bill arrives- expensive for ok Mexican."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos, rice AND beans!!! Two thumbs up. I'll definitely be back once I come to the area again."}
{"text":"Everything was great! Messy, but great. Get the pollo sandwich with peppers and guac."}
{"text":"We have never had a bad meal or service here! Amazing Latin fusion food. one of our favorite places in Huntersville."}
{"text":"The Best and highest quality Mexican food that I have had in the Lake Norman area. I've been here a handful of times. Everything that I have eaten here has been fantastic. Drinks are great too. I eat a gluten free diet & their gluten free menu is extensive. My latest server, Sherrie, also was very helpful with accommodating my needs at lunch  (which required some creativity) so that I enjoyed a delicious gluten free vegetarian burrito bowl with added pibil pork. So good!"}
{"text":"Leaves a LOT to be Desired We were seated quickly. However it took our waitress Andrea a few minutes to get to us for our drink orders. Andrea finally made it back to take our food orders and our drinks were empty. Andrea disappears again. Drinks are empty again when she returns with our food and we have to ask for refills again. The food: Flavor was good however when you order Mango-Citrus Fajitas you don't expect to have to take the tails off the shrimp before you make your Fajitas. Then there are the cheese,sour cream and pico that come with the Fajitas. They give you about 1/8th of a cup of each in a dish that is so small you can't even get a fork in the dish to put it on your Fajita. They need to make sure their dish is functional. Now we get to the Charro Beans. The serving size would have been acceptable had there been beans to go with the Brown water. There was about a tablespoon of beans under the \"sauce\"(brown water) in a cup size dish. During our meal Andrea disappears again (I think she is part of a magic act,the way she disappears) only to return as we finish and we have to ask for another refill. I doubt we return unless they lower prices and improve service."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. Mexico is here, the flavors and presentation are incredible. The service is unparalleled. A must try if you are in Huntersville."}
{"text":"Overall a great place. My food (had the Enchilada Suizas) was really amazing and had a cream sauce that was very flavorful. Although it's located in a strip mall, the inside is well appointed and relaxing. The others in my party raved about their food as well, someone else had the salmon my other friend had a pulled pork thing (sorry can't recall the name) and all of us were talking about when we'd come back. If you go on a Wednesday evening ALL wines are 1/2 off but don't go just for that, go for the food it is VERY good. I hear they make (we didn't have them) Margaritas with fresh juice, not sugar laden mixes that are supposed to be really great, oh well, another reason to go eat there and have a few drinks at the same time!  Wait staff was friendly but a bit pokey for the few customers that were there (on a Wednesday evening around 5:30) but nothing too bad.  Overall, I give it 4 SOLID stars!!. Go eat there, you will really enjoy it!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! Chips and salsa was very fresh! We had plenty of food and I took my leftovers home for a midnight snack.  Our waitress was very helpful with picking out our perfect meal since it was our first time dining with them.  I would definitely recommend this place for a great meal."}
{"text":"We waited and waited as waiter after waiter looked at our table and kept on walking. No one ever came to even get our drink order. Saved us a lot of money, though."}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try!! Excellent excellent food!! A bit pricy but worth it. If you are looking for a different type of Mexican/Latin cuisine give this place a go."}
{"text":"This place never has a crowd and I'm not sure why. It's certainly not because of the food. The food is creative, sophisticated and delicious. Work your way through the appetizers and you won't be disappointed.  Same ownership as the Prickly Pear in Mooresville if you are familiar with their style of Mexican food."}
{"text":"Hostess very nice... That was it . Food smelled great but we did not even make it to that point! Ordered a pitcher of sangria waited ................. Waited .........waited finally arrived server francisco I think was his name was the worst server ever!! Still no chips no salsa on table this is about 20 mins now pitcher of sangria almost gone ( only 2glasses each btw) finally after he took care of table that walked in 10 mins after us got there order he finally came to us we ordered 3 apps and was gonna order dinner too but I guess the 4 top that was drinking water and splitting 1 app was more important then his 100$ + table of 2 so I thought what was finally our chip and salsa yea!!! As he walked right by our table to the one behind us that was it!!! I have never in my life walked out of a place without paying needless to say we never did taste any food in the 30 mins we were there the sangria nothing to right home about cheap box  wine with fresh fruit and a 28 dollar price tag .. Over priced Mexican food! Lol I have seen 3 restaurants in that location not succeed and I feel yours won't either with the service you have! Great food can mean everything but if you don't have the servers to serve it you will fail!"}
{"text":"WOW! What a surprise. I was expecting another Mexican restaurant. But this place is fresh Cuban influenced food makes me feel like I'm back in South Florida."}
{"text":"We found the food at Verde to be very good, as we were looking for something outside of the traditional Mexican food experience. We found the service to be above average and each item we ordered was delicious. I have to concur with previous reviewers that the prices are a bit high to make this a place I would go to regularly, though I would consider it if they had a more inexpensive special."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the environment was fun. Love that it is family oriented kids also enjoyed the food. I would go there again."}
{"text":"While the food is well thought out, sometimes the flavors don't mesh well together.  There are a lot of elements on the plate and while each individual element is delicious, they don't always make sense together."}
{"text":"Read some of the reviews on here and cannot fathom the poor reviews now that I've eaten here.  The food was phenomenal from appetizer to dessert.  We started with the calamari, and it was cooked perfectly and very tasty.  My girlfriend got the Enchiladas De Falda, and I had the Pollo Rolleno.  Both dishes were excellent, but the Pollo Rolleno takes about 30 minutes.  It was well worth the wait, but something to keep in mind if you plan on ordering it.  The portion sizes are big, and neither of us could finish our entrees despite how much we enjoyed them.  We had the churros for dessert and they were excellent, as were the three sauces that accompanied them.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place was amazing!!! The empanadas were to die for.  The jalapeño margarita was fabulous! Everything we tasted was delicious.  The service was wonderful.  Try verde! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Authentic, amazing dishes. Have never had anything here I didn't absolutely love. Wait staff and hosts are incredibly warm and good at their job. They take care of you. We were there on a weekend night for the first time recently and there was live music which made the dinner even more fun! All in all, a great atmosphere for family gathering or a date!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Service was pretty good also. Can't remember the name of my dish, but it was essentially a chicken breast stuffed with cheese and chorizo and then wrapped in bacon. Yeah... it was great. Prices are going to be typically between $20-30. Not too high, but not too bad either."}
{"text":"My wife loves the new chickpea soup. Reminds her of Spain. Service is always good and attentive. The menu is eclectic Latin Fusion, always great and presented well.  Excellent desserts finish off a great meal."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here based on yelp rating and were not disappointed. Excellent food and service. The bacon wrapped chicken stuffed with chorizo is outstanding. Tableside guacamole also great."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this more than I actually do. They have two\"sister restaurants\"in Mooresville. One of them, Burrito Loco, is much better."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos ever. Awesome food. Wish for hipper location."}
{"text":"Verde is an ok stop if you're craving something south of the border but it's nothing too special. The guac is good but very expensive (you're paying for the experience though because they make it at your table) and there are a few vegetarian friendly choices, but mostly it's the traditional items you expect at all Mexican restaurants with a few extra dollar signs."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to like the restaurant since the space was vacant for so long. The hostess and waiter were very welcoming. Waiter Francisco was polite but his timing was awkward. We enjoyed the chicken taco salad we got as an app. My hubby ordered steak fajitas  cooked med and meat was very tough. He couldn't put it in the tortilla and bite it. Had to be cut with a knife and even that was challenging. I ordered shrimp fajitas and was satisfied with my meal. In previous yelp reviews I read complaints about the shrimp being tail on and how inconvenient it was to have to cut them off. Verde listened and removed tails ahead of time. Bottom line--don't see the value for the high prices."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in the area that I've ever been to!!! Try there unique margaritas."}
{"text":"The food here is Amazing- it's perfect for Huntersville. Each dishes offers unique flavors and it's hands down my favorite place for nachos. Although I strongly encourage you to try your favorite authentic Mexican dishes because you will not be disappointed. The art of presentation makes this place a great date night experience. Service is excellent! The atmosphere is fun, energetic, and offers outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I am a total foodie being in the Catering/Hospitality business for many years. I left that business, I am now a Realtor! lol. However, I've kept my taste buds and knowledge in tact and I do tend to hold them to very high standards. :) I go not for the Mexican food even though that's very good as well. I go for the Latin Nuvo Cuisine which is awesome. I am Cuban American and I'm very familiar with these type of International foods and ingredients. Chef Rene comes from New York City and he knows how to combine these flavors and make them come alive! Any of the Appetizers are simply delicious. My favorite meal is El Pollo Relleno and the Mar Y Tierra but the Pollo Relleno is a must try!!  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Lol..."}
{"text":"I loved this place. At first I was worried looking at the price. It is not cheap and I did not understand why cheese, meat and vegetables would cost so much. But this was the best Mexican food I ever had. I did not even know it could be this good and have such complex flavors. Great service too."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and both times I've had great service and great food. The margaritas are yummy, too!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of this overpriced restaurant.  Ordered some guacamole and I'm not sure what I got.  Something with mangoes and other stuff in it that doesn't belong in guacamole.  The food at Chico's and La Unica are much better and much better priced too."}
{"text":"I like the presentation, ambience and top of it  the food is yummy.I am surely gonna visit again, got to try other items."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch with my beautiful wife and loved the street tacos we had. Best we've eaten in the area since Baja Soul closed (waaaa!)  Wife is a west coastie so knowing where to find a good fish taco is essential! (She says the sangria is excellent too!) Worth noting: these are the Prickly Pear folks we have known since The Old Church days in Mooresville and it was always great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Huntersville when I'm looking for good food. It's pricier than other options, but we are lucky to have such excellent food in such a convenient location. There is nothing on the menu that resembles your standard Mexican restaurant fare. If you are looking for the typical Mexican food menu, go elsewhere. There are plenty of those places around town. This is amazing food. I have probably never ordered the same thing twice, here. I almost always go with the daily special."}
{"text":"Last night my friend and I went to Verde because we saw so many good reviews on it. While the food was good, there were many other issues with this place. First, it took 15 minutes for anyone to come to our table. When our waiter finally came he got our drink orders (cokes) and returned 10 minutes later with the wrong drinks (diet cokes). I told him that they were wrong and he was like no I'm pretty sure I got you the right thing. So I said no you definitely didn't. He went and got new drinks...and he definitely gave us the wrong ones the first time.  Fast forward...ordering food. We asked for a cheese dip for chips and he looked at us like we had ten heads. He said \"well we have shredded cheese on top of nachos\" and I said we meant to dip it in. Finally he understood. The queso came out 15 minutes later with less than 15 chips in the basket.   We ate the chips in two minutes and waited for our food. The food got dropped off from someone else and then I noticed they forgot my sauce I asked for. The waiter didn't come to check on us for another 10 minutes so my food got cold. We never got refills on drinks, never got refills on chips. Disappointing service to say the least. For the price, won't be coming back with that type of service."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and the food is very good. Staff is pleasant and punctual. Definitely a nice change to the chains nearby. Great bar drinks as well."}
{"text":"Seriously this place has yet to disappoint!  This is one of the best,if not the best Mexican food around Charlotte. Don't expect your traditional fare but a little more of the exotic side of food and fusion using great ingredients to make some remarkable flavors."}
{"text":"Delicious food, quick and attentive service, clean and colorful restaurant.  Fresh guacamole is tasty, served with fresh, flavorful salsa and home made chips.  I had vegetarian burrito--rice, black beans, grilled veggies--with red sauce and side salad, all of which were excellent.  My wife had chicken burrito which was also excellent--had tender, tasty chicken.  This was our first visit but will definitely not be our last.  If you have not tried Verde yet then I recommend that you do."}
{"text":"Waaaaaaay too expensive for Mexican food. This is some of the cheapest food to prepare. $15, $20 for dishes is just ridiculous. $6-10 for single tacos. $3 for a bottle of water. I could understand if it were a fine dining establishment. But you walk in it feels like any other cantina. There are WAY better Mexican restaurants in the area that won't force you to take out second mortgage to eat everyday food. I gave it a three star instead of a one star because the food was good. Just not THAT good."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican and not Americanized chain food. I had the enchiladas suizas and they were great. They were full of roasted chicken with a lovely jalapeño cream sauce. My friend had the pollo relleno which literally was a platter of food in itself. Good mojitos and good atmosphere. Service is not fast paced but I find that refreshing. I would highly recommend this place if you want quality ingredients and upscale Latino food."}
{"text":"We were excited that a new Mexican restaurant opened in the Huntersville area.  I'm not a fan of the bland plates served at most Mexican restaurants where the canned refried beans, rice, and cheese is piled high on every dish.    The menu at Verde is well thought out and diverse.  We have dined there at least 5 or 6 times and have been pleased with the food and friendly service each time.  Dishes we would recommend: Enchiladas Suiza, Chicken or Steak Fajitas, Pibil (pork) entree, and Tres Leches with Passion Fruit layer for dessert.   The menu is a little pricey compared to cheap family-style places nearby.  Entrees are in the $15 range.  Atmosphere, food, and service make this a strong 4-5 star option.  I don't understand the reason behind the negative reviews.  It seems that those who wrote negative reviews based on pricing or lack of cheap tacos would find Taco Bell or La Unica a better fit for their budgets.  If you don't mind paying for a good meal, friendly service, and nice atmostphere, give it a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Verde is one of our favorite places to enjoy Cuban and Mexican food.  This is not your typical Mexican restaurant with tacos and burritos but rather an upscale menu of innovative flavors and spices.  All the margaritas are wonderful so I suggest you sure you try a flight. My favorite is to end dinner with the pineapple.  Make sure you try the pork shank."}
{"text":"This place is awesome great verde burrito and service was fast I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"I'm literally in the middle of eating my burrito as I write this. YES, the burrito is so good that I had to pull up yelp and write a review midway through. This is my first time eating at this restaurant and lord am happy I did! I walked in and the customer service was great. I explained what I was looking for as i looked over the menu and they didn't have it he the gentleman went to the back and made it himself. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have been back several times and it's always a winner!  Delish! Absolutely love the tacos and enchiladas. This place is a modern upscale twist of traditional Mexican food. Their cocktails are ok point too!  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My family love a great Mexican meal. This was not great though. I wonder how long it will last. Service was ok, someone came to our table about every 5 minutes which became annoying. The food was OK, but overpriced. We will most likely never go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Verde for first time last weekend.  Not your run of the mill Mexican restaurant.  Unique dishes and drinks. Definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"My husband was craving some Mexican food and now that he is starting to use Yelp (thanks to my suggestions) he found this place with a lot of great reviews. And what a great place he found! Just fyi this is not your typical Mexican place, it is definitely better than that. The menu had a mix of different Latin American dishes, which makes this place so interesting. I took a little longer than usual to order because everything was described so well and all sounded so delicious that I couldn't decided immediately. But at the end I had the Ropa Vieja which was aweeeeesome! When I left I couldn't stop telling my husband how good the food was. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just driving by and saw this restaurant and decided to check it out- my lucky day! Finally an authentic Latin cuisine establishment of the highest caliber. Very nicely designed with an exceptional menu. Great service and atmosphere.  I got the ropa vieja and it was unbelievably awesome and better than what I used to get at Cuban restaurants in Key West. Delicious and the perfect portion size.  Don't expect chips and salsa or sloppy over-flowing plates of Mexican chow - but do expect tasteful. better quality dishes. I can't wait to return and would gladly drive 50 miles to eat here. What a fresh and delightful place."}
{"text":"In the search for non chain restaurants while traveling with my family this place was great! The menu is varied and well done.  The food is very authentic with various changes that take it to the next level. Cocktails are made to order.  Kids are able to choose various items and it is priced well. Staff was quick and efficient.  Menu prices may scare a few a way but the price meets the quality expectations and then some."}
{"text":"Great food.  Chips were hot and delicious.  Made me wish I'd ordered the tableside guacamole that the table next to me ordered which looked amazing.    Brisket enchiladas were perfect.  The rice was cooked perfectly with charred vegetables in it. Service was great.  I wish I lived here.  This place would become a favorite haunt."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous dinner at Verde! My husband had a strawberry margarita and I had the blood orange mango margarita. Both were fresh and tasty!! Started with the guacamole which was really good. We shared the shrimp Caesar salad and one of the seasonal appetizers which was a corn cake trio topped with briscit, guacamole, and pulled chicken. Both were great! Well definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Food and quality has declined over the last couple years. Used to be a great high quality place with good seafood offerings.  The last couple of times the Paella has been quite disappointing. Definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"I have eaten at verde a few times and never been disappointed. Great margarita, great food and service."}
{"text":"We decided to try Verde for our Christmas work dinner. I am so glad my coworker suggested this place! The food was excellent! I decided to order off the Specials menu and ended up with the equivalent of a Cuban charcuterie board. It came full of Cuban delights including Pork Sliders and Beef Empanadas. But the true winner of their menu: the Verde Nachos! I know it seems crazy, but these are not your average nachos. They come piled with Ancho Beef Brisket and Avocado Salsa. And they are generous with the brisket! My last tip: be careful with the Mojito... It is wonderful but dangerous..."}
{"text":"Hate to say I did not like it, but I did not. Everything tasted sweet to me. Even the black beans. I am not a fan of savory foods being sweet."}
{"text":"This place is a bit of a conundrum...I may need to give it another chance but not sure if i want to based on the prices.  I got the tacos and they were great beyond the shells which were borderline inedible.  Maybe my bad for ordering tacos for takeout?   I'd maybe order again and get something different that may travel better BUT several of the dishes are overpriced and the ones that i might consider all seem to lack an element of Mexican food I'm looking for.  I wish they offered more simplistic, affordable dishes but maybe with the abundance of other Mexican restaurants, Verde is attempting to set themselves apart and I'm just not who they're trying to appeal to."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and love their food....however, they are difficult to deal with via \"online order\" or calling in to place a to go order.    I have tried numerous times to order online but it always comes up and says \"we are not accepting online orders at this time\".    I called only once to place a to go order......someone picked up the phone and hung up.   I called back and was told \"we are not open yet but hold on\".....the guy  never came back to the phone and it was literally only like 5 minutes till they opened.    So I ordered from Zoes Kitchen instead."}
{"text":"Went for my parents 30th anniversary. We all enjoyed it very much. The food was delicious, not so much the margaritas. Not going to lie I was surprised at the prices, a bit high for the location, but it is quality food. My husband loved his Ropa Vieja plate."}
{"text":"I have been here in the past and it has been awhile since My last visit. The ingredients are fresh and it comes through in the flavor of the dishes they serve. I've always enjoyed my meal here. The craft margaritas are amazing. I wish the servers were a little faster with greeting you once your seated, but it's all uphill once you are. If you haven't been yet give it a go, bonus is that you can always find a coupon for bogo entrees or a Groupon. Well worth a visit especially if your getting a discount."}
{"text":"Went there looking for a taco Tuesday deal, and though they didn't have any, I still ended up getting tacos and they were absolutely delicious. After my first bite I literally put the taco back down on the plate in order to fully appreciate the goodness that had entered my soul. I had the verde tacos, and each taco was jam packed with juicy steak, some kind of orange sauce that was bomb, cheese, guac, and other things that blended well within the whole taco. The price was a little more than I expected for three tacos ($11), but I think it was worth it in the end."}
{"text":"Wow, what a wonderful surprise. There was a deal on living social or never would have found this place. The empanadas were delish and the Mar y Tierra were exquisite. Great service , would come back just to see Dilany...and she told me they have live music in Saturdays! Coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Food lacks any flavor.  Its basic at best.  I admire their vision but the restaurant won't last unless they realize how bad it is.  The drinks are reasonable in price but the bartender has limited experience/skill.  The only advantage in going here for dinner was I didn't have to do the dishes.  I'm having to wonder if the 5 star reviews are directly affiliated with the restaurant.  Farrrrrrrr from 5 star."}
{"text":"Nice environment but a little more fancy than I realized. Side of chips and guac goes for $9.00, no thank you. You also don't get complementary chips and salsa delivered to your table, it's an extra $3.00. The food we had was good, but nothing over the top amazing. I felt the fish taco portion was actually pretty small considering it's $11 on its own. They do have different specials nights for drinks, perhaps I'll base a future visit off a great deal there."}
{"text":"Food was ok. I think the chips & salsa were my favorite. Pretty standard rice and black beans. The shredded beef was a little sweet for my taste. Service was prompt and efficient, though I did go in at 3PM so it was empty. I'll try it again since they have some interesting food selections."}
{"text":"Delicious fusion food. After multiple visits we have never had a poor experience. Generally quick service regardless of how packed it may be. Great cocktails to choose from as well. Verde offers something new to diners who enjoy Mexican but want a more modern spin on it."}
{"text":"Today my Verde chicken burrito had several bones in it.  Not sure I want to take that risk again."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty and unique food.  Very vegetarian friendly.  Jonathan was very attentive and made sure we got exactly what we had in mind.    For the adventurous they do tweak the dishes per your request.   Prices are very reasonable.    A multi-visit place for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in all of the area. Worth the drive north on 77 to give it a try. The 3 taco platter is fantastic, love the corn tortillas. Really don't understand these negative reviews...I don't always want the 3 Amigo special or the refried beans from a can...this place makes items from scratch. So yes, it will be more expensive than a taco bell or local (tastes like every other) place. If you say flavor is missing, then I challenge you to go to Mexico and then come here...it tastes the same as local Mexican food that is not over saturated with USA additives. This place is a great change of pace and worth the price."}
{"text":"We had a Groupon to give this place a try and we liked what we received. Decor is clean and pleasant colors. Prices are definitely above a numbered combo spot and the food's quality reflected such. Our server Chris was knowledgeable and attentive. Tried the tostones which are topped with medium-sized shrimp accompanied by jalapenos,  guacamole and pico de gallo..good. Enchiladas Suizas were pretty good yet I thought needed a little more flavor/spice. Mister enjoyed his tamarind chicken fajitas and hibiscus margarita. Finished   the meal with Mexican Bread Pudding. Was impressed that it was not too sweet and simple. We will definitely be back with or without discounts."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant. The food is outstanding, and original. The service is exceptional and the staff is always so friendly. I am a raving fan!"}
{"text":"We tried Verde last night for the first time. It's in a strip mall on Gilead Rd but my husband had a nice view of a courtyard with fountains and lights. Being from SoCal, we love Latin food but this exceeded all expectations. The server was very welcoming and professional. She introduced us to the specials that highlight a different region monthly. Then they have Cuban food and also favorites like tacos and enchiladas. They don't use artificial colors flavors or additives, even in the drinks. We had Sangria and a Mango Blood Orange Margarita, both of which were delicious. For dinner my husband had Mar y Tierra $20 and I had Paella $19. Then we shared. It was so flavorful and generous portions with nice presentation. You can get the Mar y Tierra for two for $50 but we had plenty of food for $40. Great ambiance, great service, great food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal here. Ordered the ropa vieja.. Delicious!!  Big portion & Reasonably priced. $9 for an entree that could last me 2 meals! Great for lunch.  Although I didn't have any, they offer a full bar with many Mexican imports, draft beers, margarita drink specials.  Ambiance is very nice, but it is not an upscale restaurant for a romantic evening. It's more of a neighborhood everyday spot. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Still a solid choice after a few years of being in business! The Pibil and Carnitas Tacos are menu favorites. They no longer bring jicama (or anything else) to the table at the start of the meal, which is disappointing. Their queso is splendid! Very family friendly without embracing a full-on Chuck-E-Cheese vibe."}
{"text":"As usual, good service, good food. I miss the way they used to bring the Margarita in a shaker. Still, it was good also.  I highly recommend this place. Bring your thick wallet."}
{"text":"We had dinner for the first time last night and I was impressed. The menu is very diverse with many different dishes from all across Latin America not typically found in this area. The service was great and the food was very good. My steak was a little over cooked but that could have been a fluke. We will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"A lot of my restaurant reviews are on the negative side.  I tend to rip places when they deserve it.  I don't feel that giving a customer good value, good service and good food is rocket surgery .  Not this one! Verde is up there in the top three of my go to dinner places. I need to start this review by saying that their prices are a bit higher than what you expect at your neighborhood Mexican restaurant, but they are not your normal plate it, heat it, eat it joint. They call themselves Latin Fusion, they are so much more.  Their Nachos Verde is listed on the menu as an appetizer, you can make your entire meal out of this plate!  If you're expecting your normal taco meat, cheese and salsa you have no clue what your taste buds are in for.  The Ancho BBQ brisket is to die for.  Add the Avocado and Jalapeño cream and you'll never eat anyone else's nachos ever again. The Tampiqueña dish is phenomenal and very filling.  My wife and I have also eaten the Ropa Veija with a Corn Arepa (sweet corn bread) it is wonderful.  We have never had even a mediocre meal here.  As far as the service goes they have always been very attentive.  Whether we have been there as a couple, or in a group of as many as eight, they treat each customer as if we were special guests.  Recently we had dinner there and were seated near a table of about eight. They were having an excellent time but were a bit louder than I wanted to be near.  The staff very nicely moved us a quiet table up front with no hassle.  Great margaritas and a good selection of beers and wines tops off this review.  If you want to get away from your standard Mexican fare, do yourself a favor and give Verde a try. I can guarantee that you'll be back for more."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's probably my favorite place in Huntersville to eat! I've been there twice, and both times the service has been great. The beef empanada appetizer (my favorite thing on their menu) is very good, and so are the beef enchiladas. I've also gotten the caramelized pineapple margarita and that was a really nice drink! I would recommend if you are looking for a refreshing drink! They also normally have a board with specials of the day (they normally have a margarita special that's not on the menu) so check it out when you go in."}
{"text":"Verde recently changed their menu. It's so much more sophisticated now than it was! I cannot remember the name of what we had, but it was a lovely and perfectly cooked steak and a skewer of grilled seasoned shrimp atop some type of mashed-ish potato perfection and grilled veggies. Geez it was incredible. My mouth is watering as I type this. To drink we had a couple of chipotle tamarind margaritas...because one each was not enough. For dessert, we had the warm churros with heavenly dipping sauce. This place will make ya wanna smack your mama it's that good. I can't wait to go back.   The atmosphere is pretty cool too. Nice cozy low lighting. The salsa band was a lot of fun! We watched an older couple kill it on the dance floor with their sassy salsa moves! It was so much fun!   The staff was very attentive. Our waitress anticipated our needs which is always a treat!"}
{"text":"Been a while since I've checked in here. Doubled up with another couple for dinner and drinks. EVERYTHING was spot on. Wait staff was definitely on their game. Bartenders made THE BEST jalapeno cucumber mojitos. Food was exceptional. Great night all around."}
{"text":"The poor service was not worth the good food. Host took a few minutes to look up from his phone at the bar to seat us. Our appetizer arrived before our drinks which took 10 minutes to finally arrive. I admit the food was good and not your typical \"I'll have the #11 all chicken\" but we were already frustrated with the lack of service. When I decided that I may want to second glass of wine and could not wait on my server anymore I went straight up to the bar where I waited additional five minutes and never saw a bartender so I gave up. This place could be great if they improved their staffing and organization."}
{"text":"Not impressed - can hardly be called mexican food.  It resembles mexican in looks but sure doesn't taste like it.  And everything there was WAY overpriced.  They even charge you $3 to get a basket of chips and salsa at your table.  The salsa was the only thing that had any kind of spice, so it was worth it, but I will never go back."}
{"text":"Great place either for lunch or dinner.  Reasonable prices...draft beer $4 and mixed drinks $8.  Had fish tacos ($8) and marinated steak over rice with chicken taco ($11).  Both dishes were really tasty because of the Latin/Yucatan twist.  The fish tacos came with a side of latin rice and black beans (some of the best I've had).  The three cheese queso dip is a winner also."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my top 3 favorite restaurants since moving to charlotte. The customer service is always great, waiters are very knowledgeable and friendly. They usually have a special menu where the dishes are inspired by a specific South American country!  My personal favorite is the quesadilla la reina, one of the best quesadillas I've ever had. The steak tacos are amazing as well. Don't skip drinks, their margaritas do not disappoint and they have a great dessert menu as well! Really love this place :)"}
{"text":"The wife and I went for lunch here for the second time and just like the first, the food was delicious. She had the quesadilla with chicken and i had the steak burrito. I recommend both. Plenty of food, drinks are very good and the service is excellent. All for 25.00 plus tip."}
{"text":"Tasted good... speedy service, the black beans were awesome, rice good, margarita even better... have to try something different next time"}
{"text":"Excellent handmade margaritas.  Menu exciting making it difficult to decide,  service and presentation are excellent.  Another of the out-of-sight delights.  Try it."}
{"text":"Everything just seems kind of \"meh\". It is impossible to ask for things like a hotter salsa, or something on the side as you are just met with blank stares by the staff. No idea if the small things I have asked for are even available since I never actually get an answer.  Last two times I went I was not given any chips and salsa. I asked for it and never got a response. It's OK with me if there is a charge for it, but to just ignore the request seemed so weird. It's a fine place if thats where someone wants to go, or if you are in a pinch for a lunch option, but overall I am not that impressed after having lunch here 4 times. I keep hoping it will get better, maybe dinner is where its at?"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. Lunch prices were in the high end- $9- and the portions of chicken, steak or shrimp was very very light.  This area of town seriously needs a quality Mexican restaurant, but this is not it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and not impressed. Service was mediocre, food portion is small. For 12 bucks an entree you would at least expect to be not hungry after finishing the meal! It's a wanna be fancier restaurant, without the right ingredients except a higher bill."}
{"text":"stopped by Verde today specifically for the ribs for my daughter.  Unfortunately, it is a dinner item and it was 3:30.  The server went to kitchen and the staff prepared it anyway.  WOW!  Not only are the ribs outstanding, but so was that service.  They are always awesome, but this time, they went above and beyond!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today due to pinkys being closed for remodeling. There were open tables but we had to wait 15 minutes for seating. I've waited tables before so I assumed they had just sat a bunch of tables so no worries. Took a while for server to greet us and I immediately ordered queso. I was told queso already comes with chips. Thanks for the tip! Only it wasn't true. I ordered the steak burrito, hubby ordered steak tacos and our picky daughter was assured she could order meat and cheese tacos. An hour later, we sat and watched our food cook under the food warmer and couldn't find our server. We watched several people get seated and then leave thirty minutes later when they didn't even have drinks. As I was preparing to go get my food personally, the server FINALLY appeared and brought the meal. My steak burrito turned out to be some BBQ flavored chicken and rice and my husbands tacos were enough to feed a one yr old. Menu said they came with rice and beans but I guess not today. Server disappeared so I couldn't clarify. My daughters tacos arrived covered in all of the menu items that were supposed to be removed. I immediately informed the server that she would not eat them. His response: just try them. And then he performed yet another disappearing act. I love Mexican food. LOVE Mexican food. This doesn't even resemble Mexican food and certainly doesn't taste like it. After begging for the check I informed the server that the food and experience were the worst I've ever had he said \"maybe it will be better on our next visit\" there won't be one to find out. Especially after $36 for 2 hour lunch and having to leave and hit a drive thru to feed our kid. Fooled by all of the five star reviews! But not fooled twice."}
{"text":"Verde is the best Latin restaurant in the Charlotte area. I am consistently impressed with the quality of the dishes, creativity of the chef, and phenomenal service. If you haven't tried Verde before, you're missing out on on a great experience! Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Super de dooper!  A bit more upscale and sophisticated than say la unica. Food is layered with flavors. I think their prices are very reasonable. They send out mailer coupons and also often have groupons."}
{"text":"YUUUUUMMMMM!!!! They had me at Caesar Salad.... yes... I ordered a Caesar salad at a Latin restaurant and let me tell you... it was worth it. I've never had dressing so good. The chicken was moist and well seasoned. There was just enough dressing on the lettuce... crunchy croutonish (I made that up) bread.   I can't speak on the service... or at least I'd rather not as there were like 5 people in there when I went and I believe the true test of service is when it's packed or busy and everyone is expected to be on their 'A' game. I'm not trying to say that I'm trying to catch someone slipping, but if the service is good when it's busy then it's sure to be just as good when it's slow.   Anywho, the salad is good and so are the empanadas. Try it out if you're ever in the area."}
{"text":"This was the second time coming here for lunch while visiting relatives. Went on Wednesday and had half price wine which was a plus. Chose the vegetarian burrito with a side salad. Enough food for 2 meals at $9. Very filling and delicious."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner and I would definitely go back! Their margaritas were amazing, we had the original, hibiscus, jalapeno & cucumber, and jalapeno...they were all really good! They use fresh jalapenos so be careful if you don't like things spicy! I got the quesadillas which were amazing, and made my friend jealous since he wished he would've ordered the same. The portion of my quesadilla was HUGE and it had amazing flavor! My friend got the carnitas tacos which looked awesome as well! You should definitely check this place out as I am sure to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing elevated Mexican food, from appetizer (tableside guacamole), to entree (tampiquena and pollo relleno) to dessert (capirotada).  Service was excellent and entertaining as well.  We've been there twice and both times we had a fantastic experience, food and all.  Highly recommended and worth every penny."}
{"text":"We ate here again since we were close.  Another great meal, the pork Pibil dish is great as is the shrimp fajitas."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!  Had another amazing meal and great service - just what I needed after a rough week. This time I ordered the Venezuelan rice with shredded beef, fried plantains, and a fried egg all served on delicious black beans. Simply divine!  Had the bread pudding for dessert and I am a happy woman. Thank you, Verde!"}
{"text":"The margaritas alone should be why you would want to come back. The servers are super friendly, knowledge, and smart.  The food is really good too.  Lots of gluten free options as well.  The outdoor seating is nice as well.  Best Latin restaurant in Huntersville.  The dishes taste homemade and the atmosphere is great.  A+ service and quality."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for lunch. Great service and a nice variety of Margaritas! Try the shrimp tacos. Delish!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow . It took them 10 mins to take our order ,also the waiter sat his girlfriend in the dinner table and he was kissing her and he forgot that he was working. For the price they charge, the portion of the food was unacceptable. . #too expensive"}
{"text":"Love the food, especially the Del Pollo is amazing and plenty to share. The French fries are delicious. Everything taste so fresh."}
{"text":"Let's start with the service.  We ordered chips and 15 minutes later we had to remind the waiter about the order.  Once we received our chips and extremely bland salsa we received our food a minute later.  At that point there was really no need for the chips and salsa as we had our tacos.  Now let's get down to business as far as the quality of food.  The salsa tasted as if it was made from a can of pureed tomatoes.  I think there was half a leaf of cilantro and maybe a touch of onion but nothing that could compete with the atrocious flavor of canned tomatoes. As far as the tacos go, I got the Verde tacos and they were decent but by no means exceptional.  The tacos were definitely not worth ten dollars and the taco truck makes better, more authentic tacos then Verde does for a much better price.  I really don't understand the rave reviews for not only Verde Mexican and Nuevo Latin Fusion but also many other restaurants in Huntersville.  It must be that the lack of quality restaurants lowers the consumers expectation of what a great restaurant is supposed to be.  I guess I will save money and the heartache that Huntersville restaurants bring by cooking all of my own food."}
{"text":"I gave this place another shot after they added tacos back to their menu. I tried out their fish tacos. Garnished with fancy lettuce strips with very bold and flavorful green sauce. Decently priced. $7 for two. Definitely won't get you full if you're used to eating a lot so I highly recommend ordering a side or another order of tacos. Service was friendly and great. They also had live mic night the evening we went and they take reservations. We've come back for dinner a few times (now one of our favorites spots in the area) and tried a few seafood entrees, Mariscada and Latin Salmon. Both to die for. Filled with so much flavor and plenty to fill you up."}
{"text":"We ate there when it opened and it was very pricey. However, it is more upscale Mex food and not your typical Tacos and Burritos. The reason I gave it a one star is my DIL got food poisoning after eating the Ceviche. We have never gone back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to. Their take on Mexican and Latin cuisine is spot on. The food is always delicious and Verde is one of the few places that understands the power of visual presentation. We eat with our eyes. There plate presentations are beautiful. The composition of flavors and textures with each dish are well balanced. For what you get for the price, it is a great deal. I highly recommend Verde to anyone who enjoys quality food, prepared well and presented with passion."}
{"text":"I am going to be honest and mention that I've not enjoyed all of the dishes we've had from Verde but both my husband and I agree the corn soup and nachos verde (brisket) are AMAZING! We typically order take out twice a month and these dishes consistently exceed our expectation. Tonight, I ordered the tostanos, a yelp reader recommendation, and they were good. The sides were filling but the fried green plantains were a tad on the bland side."}
{"text":"I've been to Verde a few times now, and have enjoyed it on every occasion. I would describe it as moderately upscale Mexican and Latin food...so it will cost you more than your typical Mexican restaurant, but you'll have a much higher quality meal. The tacos and empanadas are delicious."}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times the owner is very hands on, the food is authentic and taste wonderful. I am not a huge fan of Hispanic cuisine but I was pleasantly surprised by quality and freshness. While we did have a tiny issue with the service the owner more than made up for."}
{"text":"My stomach is happy! And sometimes when you are at a restaurant that's really all you're looking for! The staff here is always friendly, the service stellar and the food-fantastic!"}
{"text":"The tacos were really good. The service was great. But the ceased salad was a little small for the price."}
{"text":"Really like this place. Unique menu, excellent food.  Tasted very fresh.  Always good to find something a little different than the norm and this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"So, the much anticipated wait for Verde was well worth it!  The food is wonderful, but don't go there expecting your typical heavy sauced Mexican fare.  Everything was fresh, paired well and delicious.  I started with the Sopa De Elote y Chile Poblano (cream of roasted corn and poblano soup) which if you have ever been to Prickly Pear, you know this is nothing short of amazing.  In fact, almost everyone in the restaurant seemed to be trying this as their first course.  The poblano peppers were not too spicy and the soup was perfect even for the hot and humid days of Summer.  Also on the must try list this trip were the crabcakes (three perfectly seasoned cakes on top of lemon that paired well with the subtly spiciness), Tostones (shrimp, scallops and crab blended on top of large fried sweet plantains) and the side sampler (rice and beans, the best roasted/toasted corn I have ever had, fire roasted vegetables, fried sweet plantains and pickled jalapenos) - all were delicious!!    The drink menu did not disappoint either!  The caramelized pineapple margarita was perfect for me - not too sweet and acidic, but very fresh.  My mom tried the traditional margarita that was equally as good.    Of course, who can forget the chips and salsa - this salsa is unlike any I have tried.  Very fresh, seasoned well and not too hot - there wasn't a drop left in the bowl.  The staff was incredibly nice and helpful with the menu items and as we left, everyone we passed said good bye even those that did not wait on our table.  This is going to be THE place to go for Mexican food with a little Cuban flair.  Even at 5 pm, the place was already hopping.  I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu.  Lake Norman/Huntersville is incredibly lucky Verde has finally opened its doors.  Response to comment in another review: In response to the comment that the five star rating was someone being related to the restaurant (I am assuming you mean me since I am the only one that gave it a five star) - let me assure you, I am not.  I am simply a diner who thought the food was delicious - at least the times that I have been there.  I am not surprised at some of the reviews - this is not your typical Mexican fare.  I, personally, like the cuisine and get tired of the piles of sour cream and re-fried beans that you get at every Mexican restaurant.  I think that one they get through the pains of being a new restaurant (slower service, changing the menu), Verde will be a great spot.  I may be wrong, but I happen to like how the food is plated and is served.  I think there are some interesting pairings of flavors and sides which I happen to enjoy.  I have had many dining experiences all over the country and this reminds me of restaurants that I frequented in California which I loved.  I admit, the service was definitely on the slower side, but being a new restaurant, I tried to be a little understanding.  I gave it a five star because the times I have been there, the food has been incredible and my entire party enjoyed it as much as I did and have also returned.  The prices are definitely more in line with Prickly Pear, but I go there knowing I will spend more than I would at other places and for me it is worth a few extra dollars and I don't go there every night.  Again, it may not be for everyone, but I think that it should be given a fair chance since they are still finding their way.  Give it a couple of months and try it again. Like I said, I may be wrong, but I've enjoyed my experiences there and like that it's something a little different.    Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"This place was very good! I got the ropa vieja and the Verde tacos! The food was delicious and the service was excellent and very fast! Would highly recommend if you're looking for some good Mexican food!"}
{"text":"As a Huntersville Native it's always great to find a place to wind down from my busy lifestyle. As a mother of 3 picky eaters its always hard to pick somewhere my family  will enjoy!! Me and my Husband stopped by for a Sunday Dinner and were quite pleased! The calamari was probably the best I've ever had and even more surprising. Was that my kids enjoyed it as well considering its hard to kid my daughter to try anything! Buy the manager Alejandro was so great! Always so attentive! He even got my husband to order desert which rarly happens! The tres leches which I managed to steal a spoonful of melted in my mouth. Will be back soon:)"}
{"text":"Expensive but awesome!   Quality food.   This is a high- end Mexican fusion option.   Worth a try."}
{"text":"We have been here twice. It has been a great experience. I wasn't a fan of what I got the second time, but I enjoyed the Cuban food on my friend's plate"}
{"text":"Went in expecting typical Mexican/Latin food. Poor assumption on my part. Food was excellent! Variety of flavors and preparations. Plenty from which to choose on the menu but not overwhelming. And the desserts are equally fantastic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The service was good. The food is not Americanized Mexican food. We had empanadas for apps, and two different tacos for dinner. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"We'd talked about going for months but each time I pulled up the menu online, I saw some prices and thought, \"I want Mexican, but not THAT much.\" I'm not one who normally associates Mexican food with anything but fast casual. My mistake.   We went for dinner and loved this place. I found many reasonably priced $10-15) options. My $10 steak tacos were delightful and filling. A side of homemade chips and their excellent salsa ($3) was a great starter. Husband got the skirt steak (rare) ($20) and said it was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. The enchilada and roasted veggies made it a generous portion. I will get the roasted veggie fajitas next time. They were amazing. Everything was beautifully presented, and our server was helpful, explaining some of the Columbia-influenced menu items and offering suggestions for newbies.   Don't debate anymore. Just go."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group to celebrate a birthday. I enjoyed the live music and the atmosphere, but sadly it ends there. Plates are presented well, but definitely lack flavor which was a huge disappointment. This establishment is trying to put a modern spin on traditional food, which I'm in for- but they need to season their meals before sending them out."}
{"text":"My husband and I previously dined at Verde & initially, our experience was great. Modern atmosphere, unique tasting food and gorgeous presentations. Our waiter Christopher was excellent & highly knowledgeable.   Last night after a long work week, we decided to venture to Verde again. Upon arrival, we were told that there would be a 10-15 minute wait. We walked to the bar to order drinks while we waited for a table. Even though the restaurant was packed, there was only one bartender on staff with multiple orders. He was swamped with work and he couldn't properly serve his clients. Many were frustrated. We only received our drinks after multiple comments regarding are leaving. Finally, we got our drinks and we were seated. Christopher was our waiter once again & he is so sweet and professional. He told us multiple times that it would be worth the wait. He really wanted us to have a good experience. However, the night was not a success. I order enchiladas that had a rather interesting flavor. My husband ordered a cheese filled chicken. He loved it. BUT, there was aluminum foil in his food. He proceeded to tell the waiter. The manager came out and explained the situation. He didn't offer to give us any compensation. Once we received the check, we realized that only HALF of the dinner was paid for; even though he had maybe two bites. Amazing Christopher was the only person to offer us free dessert. He insisted that we come back again. He is the star of that facility and they would be IDIOTS to fire him.   All in all, we won't be returning to Verde for a very long time. The food is unique (not my taste for Mexican but it's delicious none the less) the atmosphere is great, but they need a stronger management team."}
{"text":"First time coming to Verde and I must say I'm impressed.  The food was delicious, very filling, and reasonably priced!  I also enjoyed their signature blood orange margarita and it too was very delicious. I will definitely be coming back here for lunch. The restaurant was very clean and the server who was also the bartender was friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite Mexican/Latin restaurant.. we've been to Riviera Maya, Cancun, Yucatán, and this is the most close to authentic as we have found. The thing I noticed most was I didn't need sauces or other seasoning to help the taste of the food we ordered. My tacos were a perfect blend of flavors and so bright and vibrant colors, excellent! My wife's mole sauce was just like we were in Cancun again. Service was a bit slow, it seemed they were short handed, however the manager stepped in and helped the"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing... We had no idea what kind of food to expect and according to reviews we expected small portions and pricey food. The prices were average ($9+) however the quality of food was worth well more. And none of us could finish our food, the portions were perfect! This is definitely on our \"must have\" list!"}
{"text":"You have to give this place a try. Our first time here. Service is excellent. We got the empanadas for appetizer. A bit spicy buy so tasty. I ordered a margarita flight...writing this review is hard that's all I will say.   For dinner I got the enchiladas suizas and my husband got the shrimp tacos. Both are slightly spicy but dang they are good. The rice and black beans accompany nicely.   Will put this on my regular list of restaurants. Loved it"}
{"text":"Great place had the shrimp tacos ,sorry forget the name, very good. I also tried the Asian taco that was amazing watch out little Spicy. Friday night the had live music which was not to loud. Enjoyable!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Sadly (in this case), what a difference a year makes.  Showed up on Cinco De Mayo (just like I did last year) and could instantly tell this visit was going to be slightly different. First, it was much busier this year on Cinco and there was a bit of a wait. Reservations were made for a later time but then there was a change in the reservation to an earlier time so when we arrived, the waitress insisted the change in time \"was not updated in their system.\" So we waited for a little bit which was fine since the last member of our party hadn't arrived yet.  We were then taken to our table and that's when the experience turned full-on no bueno. We were given menus and then proceeded to wait..........................and then wait....................and wait some more.  There was even another woman at an adjacent table who told us that she had experienced severe lags in service throughout her meal and even shared a recommendation for a different Mexican restaurant not too far away (it was for La Unica for any inquiring minds).  We waited for at least 20 minutes (which I think I'm being kind on with the estimate) until we flagged down a waitress to let her know that we had been sitting there getting ignored by all of the waitstaff passing by.  Finally \"our waiter,\" you'll see I'm being VERY generous in giving him that title, came over to take our drink and dinner orders. Since we'd had SO much time to look over the menu, we ordered our margaritas and dinner at the same time.   The waiter came back to our table and dropped off glasses of water. Then another waiter came by and dropped off our food. In our ignorance, we fully expected our margaritas to immediately follow. Mind you, there was also a request made for peanut sauce to be put on the side that accompanied a meal and was promised would be coming out soon. So as we all began to eat we still expected our drinks and sauce to come out.  Waitstaff consistently pass by, \"our waiter\" is able to be seen from our vantage point washing dishes in the nearby sink, stopping at other tables, bringing margaritas to other customers all while continuously walking past us WITHOUT ever stopping to check-in with us to see if we needed anything....you know, like the margaritas we ordered and peanut sauce.  Completely fed up AGAIN at this point, we flagged down the waitress we got assistance from the first time and asked to speak with a manager. More time passes and then \"the manager\" comes over to address us. Usually when a customer asks to speak with a manger, you expect one to come out immediately - not in this case. Also, I don't really think this guy was an actual manager, I think he was playing one for the night because he never gave his name and he was seen waiting on tables throughout the night, but I could be wrong.   We explain our experience and he tells us that we don't have to worry about paying for our meal and that he would still bring out our drinks and peanut sauce. MORE time passes - YES REALLY - and nothing comes. No drinks, no peanut sauce.  Because we had taken enough, we got up and left. I mean, it's not like they noticed anyway.  I get that Mexican restaurants are busy on Cinco De Mayo but I also expect said Mexican restaurants to make sure they're fully staffed and prepared on a much-known heavy restaurant traffic night. Verde is not a new restaurant. I visited last year and things ran smoothly, albeit a little on the slow side, but still went much better.  What was supposed to be a nice evening enjoying food, drink, and conversation was severely marred and I will definitely NOT be coming back for long enough for this experience to be a foggy memory."}
{"text":"The food and service is good. Luv the jicama that you get before your meal. Haven't had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"First time resident of Huntersville and I was really impressed with food and service. The food tastes great, reasonable portion size &a best of all, at an affordable price. My waitress was the sweetest and most attentive girl. I will definitely be coming back and bring my husband"}
{"text":"Good god this place is a joke. Small portions and crap food - stay away! Ordered fajitas that came out with overdone steak, loads of onions and no additional sides. Cheese dip tastes like melted styrofoam."}
{"text":"Woah, flavors galore! We love this place! We dine here about a once a week and are working our way through the menu. It's not your average over cheesed, red sauce Mexican food. Here you'll find picked jalapenos, creamy roasted tomatillo sauce and fresh mango pico de gallo. If you get a chance, see Israel at the bar. He makes a killer margarita."}
{"text":"Start by saying this place is amazing. The wait staff was really friendly and real helpful with the menu. This place is definitely a gem in Huntersville.   This is some of the best food I've had I ever had. Every item was fill with so much flavor. I see why this place is called a Latin fusion. The calamari was great for our starters. Dinner was great as well. I had the grilled cilantro steak which was made perfectly.   All in all, great restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm so shook! WOW, the food here is legit! Service is awesome, food is bomb, place is clean could it get any better ?? Our server was very helpful! It was obvious he knew his stuff, he explained everything throughly to us, and even offered us some options. He informed us that they feature a different country food every couple of months on a \"special menu\", how AWESOME is that? Kudos to the chef(: We ordered the paella, and pescado tacos to share. Oh.my.god. Best tacos ever!! I never tasted such a perfect taco before, all the flavors combined perfectly! Certainty hit the spot! The paella was really good also, but the highlight of the meal definitely goes to the tacos. At the end of our meal, our server walked over with a tray displaying all desserts, he convinced us to order the desert empanadas (ha why not). I love the presentation, it was displayed so beautifully. Pricy? Yes but I promise you your getting your $$ worth, of Quality food! I can't wait to come back & give the rest of the menu a try(:"}
{"text":"We've been here twice, once when they opened, which was enough for me but I'm a sucker for groupons so yesterday we came back. Decor and food presentation have always been awesome! The menu's been revamped, the prices are more affordable, no more bagged chips. That's where the pro's stop and the con's begin. The restaurant decor is nice but both times we've been sat at the first available small section of mini booths and all 3 are occupied while the entire restaurant is empty. This time the table behind us was 4 young girls celebrating a birthday, I'm not a Grinch but once again, keep personal space in mind when seating people. We planned on ordering the table side guac which we remembered customer's getting the first trip along with yelpers unanimously recommending it and its no longer on the menu. The pricey dishes we ordered the first trip did not impress us but with yelp suggestions loaded we ordered confidently. The enchiladas suizas are two tacos turned sideways on top of a bowl of rice and beans, it looks nice and the flavor was there but as you cut into the enchilacos they submerge into the bowl and gets a bit sloppy. My daughter's verde tacos were served on a slim cutting board and she ended up with a complete saucey mess all over the table and her clothes. The kicker was our banter with the waiter, he repeatedly hit us with loaded questions like \"its really good, right?\" and \"how's the food, its delicious isn't it?\" The bartender began juicing limes at the bar and it sounds like a wood shop, at this point we just want to get out of this place and we became the later of our waiters priorities. When we get to our Groupon which was $40 due to the previous high prices I imagined were still in place I had to order two desserts which turned out to be $1 cheaper then our meals. Then our overconfident waiter gave me a schpiel about my Groupon being for two people but he was cool enough to let it slide... Any who, I just couldn't keep this unique interaction to myself but altogether the foods not bad and prices are cheaper but that probably did it for me."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, and we absolutely LOVED it! The space has a bright, airy interior that is well suited to the delectable smells wafting from the big, open kitchen. I ordered a caramelized pineapple Margarita, and was very pleased that it wasn't too syrupy or sweet. The pineapple flavoring was just right, and the slight sprinkle of cinnamon on top was a nice touch.  We shared the delicious calamari starter. I was reluctant to order the enchiladas suiza, but the preparation was lovely and different from anything I've had before. It's quite a large entree, btw. My boyfriend ordered the fajitas with grilled chicken marianated in tamarind sauce, and they were very tasty."}
{"text":"Great meal tonight. The jalapeño cucumber margs were very tasty with a spicy kick. My tamarind Chipotle chicken was great as well. Kid's steak was a little too spicy for our 13-year old... So be aware of spice calibration even on the kiddie menu. Our server was terrific - gave us lots of spot-on recommendations."}
{"text":"Absolutely gourmet Mexican Food! Gorgeous presentation and the most delicious herb and spice mixtures. If you are looking for a cheap taco joint this is not it!!! It is an amazing flavor experience and second to none. I have no comprehension of the negative reviews. Try it and decide for yourself. You will not be disappointed! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our first experience at Verde this past Saturday night, finally using our Groupon I bought awhile ago.  We did have about a 20 minute wait to sit down, after arriving around 9pm.  I did call ahead but they don't reserve tables unless you have 8 or more people.  We started with the Nachos appetizer which was good, but I wished I tried something different.  Maybe next time!  My dinner was delicious.  I got the Maria y Tierra (I think?) which was steak topped with shrimp over a corn cake with vegetables.  The corn cake has awesome flavor and could've been my favorite part!  My husband helped me finish my steak.  He ordered the fish tacos which he said was the best he has had in Charlotte!  He was impressed by size of the tacos as well.  We would like to come back and try some other items- and some drinks.  There was a ton of buzz in the bar area with live music.  There were some dancers who everyone was watching.  They seemed to be regulars.  The music was great- but loud.  If you want a more intimate dinner id suggest being sat farther from the bar.  Music is every Saturday, I believe.  All in all a great evening!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great restaurant in the Huntersville area! My husband and I tried this place through a Groupon!  We were very impressed.  So to start we began with some signature drinks.  I had the cucumber jalepeno margarita and my husband had sangria!  My drink was created by the bartender, Isreal!  Isreal also greeted us at our table.  He was a great waiter/bartender.  The nachos and the shrimp appetizers are a must.  We could have stopped there, but we didn't...LOL.   Entrees included Mar Y Tiera and Tamal De Hoya.  Both were incredible.  The meats in both of these dishes were so tender and well cooked.  This is not your ordinary Mexican restaurant; it is Mexican food with a twist.  The food is much more classy and well presented than your ordinary Mexican restaurants in the area.   Highly recommended. We will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Presentation is beautiful! Food and service not so much. Ordered quesadillas and the portion was way too big and it had way too much stuff in it. Workers are very pleasant but no one was in the restauarant and it took a long time and waiter did not visit table enough."}
{"text":"Excellent. Everything I have ordered has been unique (to me) and very flavorful. Exceeded my expectations! Disappointed to read (below) that they don't take reservations but they don't \"need\" to..."}
{"text":"Oh my, what a great find this was! So Mrs. M and I are headed back to our hotel after a day at the Highland Games at Rural Hill-Loch Norman and we decide to find something 'different' than a normal post-games day hamburger or steak. Boy was this different!  We had the Guacamole appetizer; the standard chips, salsa and guacamole, but with add-ones of sliced cucumbers and jicama too. Who would have known cucumbers could taste so good when dipped in salsa and guacamole? Bernie tonight, not me, but I know now!  Mrs. M had the Latin Salmon and I had Paella. Her salmon was delicious, cooked just right and seasoned wonderfully. She also was very impressed with the vegetables that accompanied her entree. Being generous she shared some of her salmon with me and it really was amazing.  My paella, made Mexican style, was a bit 'heavier' than the typical Florida/Caribbean style which I normally prefer. This version however was outstanding. All the ingredients tasted fresh and none so overwhelmed the other so the Tatars if each seafood item remained its own.   A great job, and a place I'd definitely recommend and you don't even have to wear a kilt like I did to eat there so all are welcome!"}
{"text":"AMAZING food and service both times I've been here. Try the Shrimp Fajitas. My husband likes the Pibil. The food came out hot and tasted fantastic. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful with the menu. Live music on Saturday nights. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Great service, good food, fun time!! We split the Caesar salad with grilled shrimp, ceviche and shrimp tacos... delish! Cheryl was our waitress and was super nice!! Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Verde has a great selection of dishes.   Our choices were top notch.   Started with the Ceviche which had a nice kick to it.  The only thing that I would add would be chips to go with it (we asked and they delivered).  We had the Pilbil which was very good.  Also had the Ropa Vieja which did not disappoint.   This is a hidden Gem and is not to be missed."}
{"text":"What an incredible find. I had the fish stew and it was so delicious. So fresh and perfect seasoning. I wish I would have taken a picture the dish was beautiful I had Creme brûlée for desert. Was delicious, a little different with a touch of lemon. Service was top notch and the atmosphere is nice as well. It's kept very clean. I will definitely be back! Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting. Better! If your in the area, go for it.  I had the \"Enchilada De Falda.\" No idea what was in it, but it was SOOO good."}
{"text":"Amazing apps plus fish tacos & paella will blow you away. Fabulous restaurant & service was excellent."}
{"text":"Not a bad place but not great either. They put lots of spices, sauces, etc on food that does not need that at all. We came over here for lunch as it is close to my wife's office. Ordered the empanadas for appetizer and it came with sauces on top of it and under the empanadas there was guacamole. That's not how you do empanadas at ALL, and, in fact, does not harmonize either !  Ordered the tortas for lunch (both of us) and they were pretty good. However, the fries were ready WAY before the tortas were. I could see them sitting on the counter for literally 10 minutes before the food was ready. What happened when it was served? Torta was nicely fresh, warm, and the fries were rubber !  Waitress was nice, but, she didn't check on us that often. She came in to pick up the order, deliver the order and that's it. The restaurant wasn't even busy at all. I do not think it is her fault either, as we noticed at the end that she was the only one working that day and time and had to wait on the entire restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Verde!  I can't go without getting the nachos and the cocktails are pretty great too.  We like to bring out of owners here, which says a lot.  The service has always been really good as well!"}
{"text":"This is our go too favorite spot! All the dishes are great! Very different and tasty! Love the veggie fajitas, Ceviche, Enchiladas, and tacos.  Tamarind Margaritas are made from scratch, best drink ever!"}
{"text":"Decided to use a Groupon to try Verde. It was a tremendous drive for us, but they have margarita flights. Hopefully, it's worth it. We were sat quickly because the place was almost empty. 4 tables with customers all next to one another. They seem short handed.  Poor waitress. She was very nice. But seemed overwhelmed. We asked her about being celiac friendly and she confidently beamed, \"All of our food is just about gluten free. You would think right?? Wrong I must say first, my wife and I really enjoyed our meal. We had shrimp tacos and their ropa vieja. The portions were on the small side, but super tasty. We also had a flight of top shelf margaritas which were unique and tasty.   Unfortunately, my wife has been doubled over in pain from being \"glutened\" There must have some cross contamination because what we ordered should have been safe. So I don't think we'll be returning."}
{"text":"First,I'll preface that I rarely ever give 5s, but I had no complaints my entire visit.  This place is a new little hidden gem in Huntersville in a revitalized area where they're bringing in all types of shops.  I love Mexican food and this was a great spin on traditional Mexican food.   What's interesting is that the owner is also the owner of Prickly Pear up North. They've brought that spin on a traditional ethnic cuisine and fused it with a little mix of everything.  The decor doesn't scream authentic Mexican restaurant but it has a nice spin. Bright colors and open space, live band on weekends, and small but quaint.  Now on to the food...absolutely delicious.  First the margaritas. Non traditional flavors like Blood Orange. That's what I got and it was just enough sweetness mixed with the sour margarita mix. For my entree I got the skirt steak and shrimp and potato pancake. Amazing. The potato had a little sweetness to it, was as large as the plate. The steak was cooked to perfection, medium well..so tender and juicy. 4 large jumbo shrimp to top it off. I only wish I had more at the end but that's not a knock at the restaurant.   Lastly, I have to mention their cute bill folders. They are little cheese graters which are so cute and unique. Definitely a place where details aren't missed and taste isn't sacrificed.  It's rare you can get both together."}
{"text":"Wow where do I start. This was my first time here for lunch. I order fish tacos and jalapeño margarita. The fish tacos was good and tons of flavor. The rice was spicy and the beans were the BEST beans I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant. The margarita was so good I could only drink one. I will definitely be back and bring the family. I can see this being a regular hang out spot for me. Free wifi next door from Fedx. Parking may be hard to find due to many restaurants and business in the area.   Prices are reasonable. Service was excellent.  Food is displayed like art work LOL. I love pretty food. We eat with our eyes. This is a great place for a group work meeting or date night. Kinda fancy for kids. Drink are high quality and no watered down drinks. Everything here is super freshhhhhhh."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhhh my goodness!! Unexpected treat. True Latin fusion faire from all over Central and South America! I had the Tampiqueña... A fabulous grilled skirt steak, topped with cactus pico, and paired with a chicken mole enchilada. The mole has the heat and sweet that's perfect with the chicken.... And the skirt steak, was perfectly tender for almost fork cutting!  And to top it off a BEAUTIFUL presentation! (Not a light dinner so fair warning!)"}
{"text":"Wow!  How can you screw up chips and queso?  The chips were INCREDIBLY stale and the queso was very runny!  I just wanted a quick snack and got this as takeout - super disappointing - chips really inedible."}
{"text":"Apparently the enchilada's are pre-made and they can't put the chicken on the side -_-    Update: just got the food there were three enchiladas and they couldn't keep the chicken in one of them   Just asked for the only soup option on their menu: don't have it   Just asked for piña coloda (virgin): don't have it  Our waiter, Sebastian, made us feel like anything we ask for will be declined.   It was a good thing we were starving that we got through our meal."}
{"text":"Good reliable food. I prefer to come at lunch because you get dinner portions at lunch prices. For example tacos are $10 but for lunch it come with a side of rice and beans...the cost for the exact same meal at dinner is $14. Also, during lunch they give you free chips and salsa, during dinner hours you can purchase chips and salsa for $3."}
{"text":"Great experience here.  Staff was super attentive.  Owner came of and introduced himself. Food was quick.  And the things I had were flavorful and a good portion for the cost.  Have cool magarita options that include spicy corn, tamarind, chipotle avocado even. And you can try them at a low risk $15 for a flight of 4 of them. The ceviche appetizer has amazing presentation and nice flavor.  Few big shrimps hiding in the mash of spicy sliced of veggies and topped off with guac and a ring of tortilla to dip with.   Had pescado (fish) tacos for a meal.  Large portion.  Corn tortillas.  Very good. Really a great experience you can the owner really takes care in every experience here."}
{"text":"Ok overall I'm giving it 4.5 but rounded it up since you can't really do 4.5!   Let's start with the wait THERE WAS NONE! Woohoo  5 stars!   Our hostess was very polite and helpful and briefed us on the menu and their special being we were new!  5 stars!   We were seated at a nice cozy window seat with a view of the patio.    Ramón was our server and while he wasn't the most knowledgeable he was a eager beaver to help and quickly- we asked quite a few questions being new and about half stumped him but he would quickly run  to kitchen and get our answer.  I think it was a combination of being new and young.  Good job  anyway Ramón !!! 4 stars!   We started with  beer, red wine  (lil stingy on the pour but really good wine) Camp Veijo was the wine and an order of calamari!!! The calamari was delish except no tentacles  which I happen to like! 4 stars   We shared the Bandeja Paisa more than plenty for 2 priced at $26 bux but boy was it good.  WARNING  it comes with morilla which is blood sausage actually made with pork blood - ME NO EAT BLOOD - so if that's not your fancy ask them to sub with more chorizo sausage   Everything thing else on this plate was delicious- it includes arepa (Mexican cornbread); chorizo sausage; flank steak; chicharron (thick baconish stuff) white rice with a fried egg on top; well seasoned black beans; salad with fresh avocado  and tostones or sweet plantains if you ask for those instead and a verde type salsa  5.5 stars  lol    Finally we finished it all off by sharing the pineapple empanadas which were just sweet enough served with ice cream caramel and fresh blackberries   We will be back !!!!!!  UPDATE - I neglected to mention that the owner visited our table a generous amount of times to ensure we were pleased with our dining experience- GOTTA LOVE  THAT!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, slow and dismissive staff, terrible food. Verde tacos were the only good thing we ate - however the wonderful flavor of them was dampened by the cost ($11 + $4 for canned beans and rice). Ceviche was more like bland salsa. Was never brought a drink menu."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. It's our favorite place for date night. Excellent service, authentic dishes, generous portions, reasonable prices. And, I love that it's minutes from my home. Excited that they are resuming live music on the weekends.   Updated 9/30/16:  Subtracting 2 stars because I think it is absolutely ridiculous that you cannot make a reservation unless you have a party that is bigger than eight people. Seriously? How often are you going to get a party bigger than eight? I think this is stupid. So they just don't care about the people who were wanting to go out on a date night or maybe a family dinner night with A party of 2 to 5 people."}
{"text":"Road trip find... 1 mile off I-77. Relied on reviews on Yelp.  Very impressed. Food was fresh, flavorful and prices super reasonable. Service was friendly and attentive. Only wish we had a place like this in Lake Mary, FL."}
{"text":"Awesome! Super fresh and yummy! My go to for lunch while at work! Friendly staff and great health rating (97)!"}
{"text":"Fancy Mexican, thankfully came with a Buy one get one 1/2. Still pricy. Good food just more new age than what I'm used to. Small portions. Always is crowded so it just must not be for us!"}
{"text":"We loved our first visit, & I gave it 5 stars. This time we still had a good experience, but they've lost 2 stars.  First off, the prices went up and portions went down. My fish tacos plate were 3 mini tacos for $11.00. The sauces were flavorful, but a little too sweet for a fish taco, and it overpowered the taste of the fish. If the plan is to cover a bad fishy taste, it worked. But I like the taste of good fish.  Second. The shrimp fajitas was skimpy too. Looked like an appetizer. No bell pepper or poblano, just onion. Lame. Third. The paella had perfectly cooked seafood. Kudos on that. But the rice mix was too wet, and almost zero herb/safron taste. Fourth. The falda enchiladas are very good. But at that price some rice and beans would make it a meal. For the high price I expect that.  Fifth. My wife's mojito was $7 and very little if any rum.  Still like this place. A little disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome place! We purchased a Groupon that gave us $60 to spend on either lunch or dinner. I would recommend going with people (we had 4 people in our party) and going before 5 pm for lunch. the lunch menu is much bigger and much cheaper than the dinner menu. We ordered 10 dishes and were only $3 over the limit! Super fresh food. Service was a bit unfriendly but it was pretty good timing wise. Be sure to order the mango shrimp tacos!"}
{"text":"ANTICIPATION.... Satisfied.  I have been waiting for Verde to open, and I was AMAZED at the varied menu.  If you are craving \"traditional\" Mexican fare, skip this restaurant.  While the menu does contain regular menu items such as fajitas, and enchiladas, you would be amiss if you didn't try the Chamorro.  It is \"SLAP YOUR MAMA GOOD!\"  As a precursor, or Amuse Bouche , I ordered the corn green chile soup.  It was an explosion of perfect taste.  I Highly recommend trying... You will not be disappointed.  The only Negative thing I can say is that the prices are a tad bit high, but if you weigh the quality of the food and dining experience versus the bill, you will have no problems paying."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was terrible. Waitress was very confused and the. Double charged my CC."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, perfectly done, and the presentation just as great. Two Margs, Guac, and dinner and we can barely move. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Verde was a haul due to it being in Huntersville, but well worth it! One of the best Mexican fusion restaurants I've been to in NC. Our servers name was Chris and he was so passionate and knowledgeable about the menu. I had a shredded beef dish and my girlfriend had a steak dish - both were delicious. The topping on the cake was the presentation of each dish. They were clearly thought out and were done w/ pride. We will certainly be back as soon as possible!"}
{"text":"Amazing and unique Latin fusion dishes each one better than the previous. It's hard to describe the combinations of flavors or pick a favorite but if you haven't tried Verde you need to get here soon."}
{"text":"Holy mole. This place is amazing! Started things off with ceviche and a caramelized pineapple margarita. Thought things couldn't get any better until I had the first bite of my ropa vieja. Everything was to die for! Finished dinner off with another drink...had to try the chipotle tamarind margarita!! Verde has a creative menu with lots of unique options, all with great presentation. Super friendly service too. And you can't beat the patio, surrounded by magnolia trees with a waterfall fountain! I already can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is always fun!  Do yourself a favor, be brave and order something you have never heard of.  We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Amazing verde steak tacos! The queso dip is excellent as well. They aren't charging for chip and salsa anymore either which is really nice!"}
{"text":"So I tried going to this place on a Friday night. They were very busy and appeared to be understaffed. After being ignored for 5 minutes, I left and headed over to 5 Guys. I had a Groupon so I came back on a Tuesday around 5:30 when I figured they'd be slow. I ordered the tequila steak fajitas and my hubby ordered the chipotle chicken fajitas. They aren't the typical fajitas that come out sizzling but more like tortillas and sour cream, cheese and meat plate with black beans. The black beans were very tasty and wet and delicious almost soupy. The steak was flavorful and tender. I tried the chicken and it was also very good but not too spicy. Overall, the food was fresh and delicious but the prices were not reasonable without the Groupon. $40 for 2 entrees with no free chips and salsa in not a great value for Mexican food. Although the food was good, the place is trying to be fancy and is overpriced. Even though I live nearby, this will not be my new go-to restaurant for Mexican food. Also, they charge extra for every little thing like $2 extra for jalapeños! Just be advised that even without any drinks (just water), you will spend $40 for dinner for two."}
{"text":"My husband and I had hopes for this place. Service was terrible both in terms of speed and friendliness. We ordered the Mexican flag app, that was good but we finished it before our margaritas came out as they took nearly 20 minutes. This was on a Saturday during lunch when there were maybe four other tables with people and an abundance of staff standing around. The margaritas were $9 each; very small, not very flavorful and could have even been sans alcohol, very disappointing.   I ordered cheese quesadillas and was charged the full menu price ($12) for quesadillas that contained meat and other items. Rice was a few dollars, small portion and lacking in flavor. When it was time to cash out, it took ten minutes for the bill and then another five minutes for my card to be returned. Once again, during a very slow Saturday lunch. When the server brought my card back, she said \"here you go\". No thank you, have a nice day, come back etc. Even though my husband enjoyed his meal and it seemed like a decent portion/good flavor, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Service is a little iffy, that's why I went with 4 stars. The food is great!! Just a little pricey. I love the shrimp tacos and the jalapeño margaritas. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. So far have tried the pibil, Ropa Viejo and the mango shrimo fajitas which are my favorite from the entrees.   Best are the Churros which they brought out on the house"}
{"text":"Sorry, but this place is NOT authentic Mexican Food. They try, but it's not this Mexican's place for food!"}
{"text":"As a Mexican food lover, I really like the concept of creating slightly more upscale/modern Mexican dishes with a twist, and I think Verde does this well but doesn't quite nail it. I ordered the Tamal de Hoya which is a braised pork shank over polenta with peppers and onions, and my girlfriend ordered the enchiladas de falda which had slow cooked beef brisket in corn tortillas with a poblano cream sauce and came with a side of rice and black beans. The pork shank I received was ridiculously tender but didn't have a ton of flavor; overall it was enjoyable just for the tender meat. The polenta was average: a little runny and again not super flavorful. The peppers and onions were almost entirely missing except one lone pepper slice I found and the pickled onions on top of the pork. I was also very disappointed in the portion size for $20- it definitely needed a side or some tortillas to be filling enough. My girlfriend's enchiladas were good but not great as well. The poblano cream sauce was to die for, but the brisket wasn't super tender and the sauce on the meat was almost too sweet to be enjoyable. The rice and beans were both very average. Her portion was slightly larger than mine since it came with sides but not a feast like you typically receive at authentic Mexican restaurants. I was also disappointed that you do not get complimentary chips and salsa; I would have paid the $3 but didn't realize this until after we ordered. The service was average and the food came out pretty quickly as well. Overall, there were some big hits and a few misses, but I would still recommend giving Verde a try to experience a more modern approach to Latin cooking."}
{"text":"The food here just burst with flavor! The service is hit or miss. There is a guy waiter who hardly checks on you and acts like he is rushing you. But the food has never disappointed me. I've been there twice and very satisfied with the taste!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. Has plenty of price options and food options with flavor palette options as well. Much better than LA Unica"}
{"text":"So so good! My friend and I shared the brisket nachos and they were delicious! The margaritas were mixed perfectly and had just the right amount of potent punch! Very friendly waitstaff and a very sincere manager who asked about our experience as we left! I've always loved Prickley Pear and so enjoy this little spinoff in Huntersville !"}
{"text":"This is some very unexciting Mexican food here. I ordered the queso fundido and my fiancee ordered the enchilada suezas and both were rather flat on flavor. The service was slow, but our waitress was also the bartender so she looked to have her hands full. We were never offered chips and salsa which was unexpected for a place like this. Their hot sauce was probably homemade and was phenomenal so it isn't like there aren't any bright spots. This place is just not worth going to."}
{"text":"We had an excellent waitress named Jennifer. However my husband orders fajitas and can't eat onions due to allergy, but received his order loaded with onions. He sent it back and t came back with onions picked out; we knew due to the leftover onions they missed picking out. The salsa was good, I had the tacos which were mediocre. We did get complimentary churros because of the fajita issue, which were good. The prices are too high for the supply."}
{"text":"Wow! Don't miss this or misunderstand this place. I wrongly assumed it was a typical Mexican restaurant and I like typical Mexican restaurants! But this is so much more! Food was fantastico! Selection of menu was interesting upon reading the menu and the food was even better than the description. Our waiter was very attentive and provided good help with the menu and perfect service."}
{"text":"Not your typical Mexican restaurant. The best word for it is \"fresh\" - the menu is very diverse and everything we have had is amazing. The presentation/plating is really well done, the cocktails are always solid, and they have live music on the weekends for dinner. On the pricier end for this type of cuisine but worth it for a nice night out."}
{"text":"We last visited Verde with a Groupon and really enjoyed the fajitas, very unique, tasty and well presented!!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks as always were amazing. Service was a huge step up!  I got the recommended ribs special with corn and fries. Sounds generic and anti-Mexican food but I promise, they found a way to make it truly gourmet and amazing. Very happy for the focus on service. It makes for a much better experience all around."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The server was very attentive. She was also very knowledgeable about the menu including which items would be gluten free. She made using the Groupon quick and easy....no hassles. The kids meal prices were very reasonable. The only reason I held out on a star is because we had to get our creme brulee remade because it was missing the caramelized top and my coffee wasn't hot. But otherwise it was a great experience and we plan to return."}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would be my new fav but I was disappointed. Food was not to my liking, over priced and the service was not very good. Busy place so I'm assuming that is why our waiter left us parched for drink refills. The chips were not very good as far as chips go in a Mexican restaurant, and we only got them after the waiter asked if we wanted some cheese dip or guacamole and was charged $9!  If I return I will be ordering only cocktails (on the specials menu) and maybe a kids meal as those seemed pretty well priced and ok."}
{"text":"What can I say about Verde and Chef Garcia? This is my family's favorite latin restaurant in the entire world. It is always challenging to decide for an entree here because they are all beyond delightful. The Yuca Mofongo with seafood is one of my favorites here and lets not forget about the Nachos with brisket. The service is great, the environment is great and the food is to die for. We love you Chef Garcia! Thank you for the beautiful food!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! My first time there ... My guest and I had lobster fried shrimp tempura style.... Steak tacos with avocado salsa with fresh pico!!! Yummy! The drink was a mango chamy....martini with a kick! Definitely will be going back for the rice and beans as well!!! Excellent!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our road trip and so glad we did! The 3 tacos Verdes are delicious! The kids steak quesadillas were so good we ordered an extra order. The salmon was fresh and amazing. The Churros and Chocolate cake were a perfect finale to our meal. So glad we stopped here!"}
{"text":"Acceptable food but service by some staff is under par.  I believe the manager or owner's son works there and he is terrible.  Lazy, slow and a really nasty attitude.  Throw in the fact that they changed my time form $5 to $50 makes me never want to return to this restaurant.  Thankfully Amex stood up for me and I got my money back."}
{"text":"I am happy to say that Verde has found their stride.  They updated their menu and added back tacos, in addition to a lot of new specialty items that show both the chef's creativity and the kitchen's adeptness at preparing them.  Service has also improved, with friendly and efficient servers.    While the queso dip is not on the menu, you can still order it, and I was pleasantly surprised with the heat of the dip (both temperature and flavor-wise).  It was still a bit thick, but the taste was fantastic.  On a recent visit, we tried the Ropa Vieja and Mar Y Tierra.  I only preferred the latter dish because it was less sweet, but both were well prepared and nicely presented.    Verde is going back on our dinner rotation!"}
{"text":"Verde consistently shocks me with fantastic flavors, a wide variety of offerings, and a level of quality in the food that raises my eyebrows every time I try something on their menu.  I wish I had found them 2 years ago when I first moved to Charlotte.  You will never be sad after eating Verde."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  Had a party of 10 on a Saturday night for my brother's bday and it went off without any issue! The server never wrote anything down, and everything came out perfect! I was amazed, and I'm hard to please! They have a good wine selection also, which surprised me!  Oh, and u must try the Churros for dessert!! Too good not to just do it!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. It was definetly a late lunch around 230 pm. The restaurant was empty but the service was quick. Usually I have found when a restaurant is empty, the servers are in the back and it's takes a bit for them to come back up front. This was not the case here.  This is my 3rd visit. I ordered the guac fresco appetizer. The quac was very flavorful and fresh. It's the best quac that i have had so far.  For lunch I ordered the crab cake sandwich called the de jaiba.  It was delicious. The cake cake was solely breading and the Mexican role was crispy, flaky and toasted.  It came with fries. I am not a. I fry eater but these were good as well.      Overall not a typical Mexican restaurant but with a good twist.  I will be back...."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks were ok. Good service. If in the area again would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This place is near one of the offices I work.  I didn't have neither a bad experience nor a thrilling one. I came for lunch on a weekday and it wasn't busy at all, so no wait to be seated or get our food.   The waitress was nice.  The menu was pretty big, but everything was just too expensive for lunchtime.  I think a lot more places need to get in on good lunch deals!!!!  It makes everything more appealing.   My food tasted good. It came out hot and fresh.  No complaints on how it was prepared."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this place doesn't have a line wrapped around the door!! Food was nothing short of amazing....  Guacamole  is excellent. Just right amount of spice and lemon juice.. Accompanying salsa is delicious as well.  I had Chaufa con camaron as my entree... That peanut sauce was so good..  I had the privilege of sampling the Tamal de Hoya as well. The cuban polenta was to die for...  For desert, I had the white chocolate tres leches...  The food was definitely worth the trip to Huntersville..."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had two Sangrias which were $2 each. This was a special on Thursday. I had the Enchilada de Falda. Omg. The most delicious thing I've ever eaten.  The service was fantastic. Thanks for making my evening!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and everything is great. Love getting lunch here. Great margaritas."}
{"text":"Great food, good service.  Wish wasn't in strip mall. Too good for that!  Tasty, spicy!   Super quick and reasonable price"}
{"text":"We drove all the way from downtown Charlotte to eat at this place because of good reviews this was our first time here. We asked to be sat in the bar area where there was one other couple due to the main restaurant was busy & full. The hostess was very rude and inattentive meanwhile walking through the restaurant sipping on a Chick Fil A drink.   After the hostess sat us we were unaware of who would be serving us as the hostess laid the menus down and walked off. The bartender is who was suppose to be serving us as we say there for 15 minutes without someone coming to the table with water or to tell us it would be a few minutes before someone would be able to wait on us. During that wait I got up twice to ask the hostess if there would be someone waiting on us that is when she went over and told the bartender and he told her he made hand gestures as if he didn't want to wait on us. So then proceeded to walk through again without coming and informing us that it would be an even longer wait.   Finally after all that I walked back up to the hostess station to ask her could we just move to the main area where people were being served properly and waited on she was reluctant to answer and as we stood there in silence I asked \"are we suppose to seat ourselves?\" She said \"YEA\" !!! I then asked could I speak to a manager and she laughed and rudely stated \"oh, he's out of town\" and there will not be a manager to assist us.   This by far was the worst customer service in a restaurant I've ever experienced and the rudest bartender and hostess. I will not recommend this restaurant to people and will definitely tell my dental colleagues in the area not to go to this place."}
{"text":"Everything was awesome! The service was excellent. Food was 5 star. The calamari is perfect not over cooked and zero small tentacles. The plate is professionally garnished. Waiter was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Fantastic steak. We have gotten several things here and I can honestly say, it is always outstanding.  My absolute favorite is the Mar Y Tierra.  Soooooo delicious!!!   Great service and awesome food....consistently.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We just love Verde. Many people don't know this, but Verde is a sister restaurant to Prickly Pear in Mooresville. And... people don't realize that Burrito Loco (in Mooresville), is also their sister restaurant. Each version/restaurant has a completely different feel and menu, so, you must try them all!   Verde is at exit 23, basically right near the hospital. It is casual and modern inside - floor to ceiling windows, well lit and decorated, low key and plenty of seating. They even have patio seating for when it's nice outside. We occasionally see deals from this place (on sites like Groupon or Living Social), which are a great way to get you in the door.   It might help to mention we live in Mooresville, yet, sometimes drive PAST Prickly Pear all the way to 23 just to come here. It's very good. And the drinks - oh my! You MUST try the Caramelized Pineapple Margarita. I do NOT like Margaritas, but I love these. They make all of their drink mixes from scratch - no crappy mix here. I recommend trying just about all of the appetizers, and anything with pork. Oh, and don't forget the fresh guacamole. YUM! Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"We went to Verde for July Restaurant Week.  I had the grilled shrimp appetizer, the pork tenderloin entree, and the passion fruit tres leches cake for dessert.  Overall, it was an average experience.  The service was friendly, but it was quite slow, especially in light of the fact that there were very few tables.  It took 15 minutes to take our drink order and 40 minutes to get our appetizers.  The shrimp appetizer was a well thought out and tasty dish, but it came to the table lukewarm, which made it somewhat unpalatable.  The pork tenderloin was well-cooked, but frankly, it and the accompanying Demi glacé were extremely bland, as was the plantain mash.  I will say that the passion fruit tres leches cake was delicious.  However, with plenty of places to eat around here with better service and food, I highly doubt that I will return."}
{"text":"Really tasty. Great flavors. I had a pork enchilada dish that was covered in sauce and very salty but delicious...  The queso and salsa were very fresh. We loved the chips! Tasted so much better and not stale or over salted.  The service was great- very nice servers! We would come here frequently but it's a tad overpriced. Quality is good though...but with drinks it adds up to $50+ easy."}
{"text":"The place has good options. And the food is very well served, and tastes very good too. The portions are workable and are decently priced. You should give it a shot if you are in the area."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The desserts here are not that great but the food is delicious! So full of flavor! Definitely a place to go if you're in the mood for some great food!"}
{"text":"Delicious tapas style for lunch and a little more gourmet at night!  Great ambiance and the staff is really awesome!"}
{"text":"I came in on a Tuesday night and had the steak fajitas, which were very tasty.  Nice size portion, very fresh tasting.  The menu isn't what I was expecting, because I was thinking this was more like the traditional Mexican restaurant that normally gives you a side of re-fried beans and rice with the meal.  The salsa you get with the appetizer is very good, but they really should offer more.  My sister had a question about a menu item, the chef actually came out to answer it, which was a pleasant surprise.     Overall, it was a good experience.  Will be back to try again."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants we have been to in Charlotte. Excellent food and service. Their enchiladas had absolutely no cheese on it and yet tasted delicious. Their fried plantains were yum as well. We tried the chocolate peanut butter mousse desert which was fresh and tasted good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've dined at Verde several times in the past and it's been great.  This past week was different.  Our server was aloof and arrogant.  They were out of guacamole and avocados which are featured in many dishes on the menu.  They were out of corn soup and won't be serving it anymore, even though it's on the menu.  The shrimp in the tacos were very fishy and mealy tasting.  My chicken dish was heavy and greasy and was served sitting on a bed of soggy potatoes.  My wife's margarita never showed up but we were charged for it with no apology.  Overall, a big dud this time.  Bad enough where we will not return."}
{"text":"Was hoping for authentic Mexican food, but it was more of a Latin twist. They have a short menu, wait staff are slow even when it wasn't busy. The only thing I was impressed me was the prices. Everything was extremely spicy. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Returned to try Verde again and had a completely different experience from when they first opened.  This is now one of my favorite places, especially for Mexican food with flare. We had the guacamole app and it was honestly the best guac I've ever had - and I'm picky.  My husband had the pollo relleno, I had the Pabil (slow roasted pork), and our niece had the Tampiquena (steak).  We all LOVED our dishes and couldn't stop talking about how delicious everything was.  Portions are large, too - we all had leftovers, even my husband! :-)  Their sangria is great, too.  It was a beautiful spring night so we ate on the patio which just made everything even better.  And our waiter, Israel, was awesome - friendly, sense of humor, attentive but not overkill, and knowledgeable on the menu.  Great experience altogether and can't wait to return to try something else on the menu!  Highly recommend this for a fun night out."}
{"text":"My only regret is that I didn't order more. We started off with the tableside guacamole and Tres Quesos. Both were executed perfectly. The salsa struck an ideal balance between fresh, sweet, and spicy.   I had the Tacos Verde for my meal -- I can't recommend them enough, especially if you like a little heat. The fish tacos and corn soup were hits with our party as well.  I'll need to find more reasons to head north of Charlotte in the future -- this will definitely become a regular stop when I'm up this way."}
{"text":"I feel obligated to write an update to my previous review. The menu has changed drastically!  And in a very good way.  So, Verde went from mostly Mexican cuisine to a Latin American fusion.  The menu selection is large and varied.  I dined with a wonderful group of 8 for a much needed ladies night. All meals came out hot, orders correct and deliciously delicious. We had the shredded beef nachos for app and it was stupendous. Not your typical nachos.  Lots of different flavors combined. The fish tacos are still the same. 3 yummy and hardy, overstuffed tacos. One of my friends ordered the ropa vieja and said it tasted like the real deal. Note, we come from Miami where this dish is in all Cuban restaurants so we've had our share of this popular dish.  Another friend ordered the yucca mofongo and said she felt like she was dining in Puerto Rico. That's alot to say.  I could go on and on about our dining experience tonight but I'll shorten it and leave it at this: I'm so happy with this new menu. I will be returning again very soon.  Oh! And the guava margarita...heavenly!"}
{"text":"Love the bartenders at Verde! Israel & Alex are the real deal! They take pride in their signature cocktails and are full of information on what to drink based on your taste buds. Love the wide selection of Margaritas and Tequilas! Will definitely be a repeat customer! We had the Chipotle Tamarind Margarita and the Jalapeño Margarita. Both were devine!!"}
{"text":"My goodness! I wasn't expecting to find food this yummy of this specific type of food in North Carolina!! I thought everything was quite tasty! Only reason I hold back a star was for the interesting take they had on a bean & cheese burrito for my daughter.. Being a California Native, I am pretty well versed in Mexican cuisine-- but wow! What a change of page for Mexico City Style!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely time for an update and in some ways, a lesson learned by me around premature Yelping (Is there a drug for that?).  My 2013 one star review was accurate in terms of the rating and content and also was in line with other many other reviews at the time but I didn't cut enough slack for the relative newness of the place so didn't adequately give them space to get their culinary legs under them.  After seeing Verde's star count rise over time, my wife and I have now given them another chance, and then another and then another.  You get the drift.  They've made tremendous improvement in quality and are a nice alternative when you feel like something Mexican but maybe a cut above from the usual.    They've also introduced some other regional menus in the evenings.  I think the last one I saw was Cuban-centric.  I think that's a nice touch though I haven't been there for anything other than lunch.    Service has been good and friendly and I really enjoy the Mexican Flag app which is a small dish with three separate openings, one filled with guacamole, one with queso and one with salsa.  Get it... Mexican flag...  All three are good and compliment each other well."}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Huge portions for the cost. Well rounded & developed flavors. Not your typical Mexican restaurant but still very authentico. Helpful servers who know the menu & how to help you choose something for your pallet. I will be returning to this place soon. So good!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a new lunch place last weekend and came across this on Yelp.  While it may not be really NEW, it was new to us.  Wow!  So glad we stopped in. Awesome menu (going back for dinner since that menu was even better), great service and the meal was perfect.    Next time, I'm trying the margarita flight.  Thanks for a great lunch!!"}
{"text":"Ceviche and camorones capeados apps with enchilada de falda DELICIOUS!  Service was excellent! Margaritas were top shelf. Pass on the jalapeño margaritas.   We highly recommend."}
{"text":"I braved 77N traffic into Huntersville to try this restaurant. Admittedly, I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food, but I had a desire to eat some paella, after not having any for a few years. Verde is spacious and bright. The server was friendly and accommodating, tweaking a few things on the menu to my friend's specifications. I had the calamari as an appetizer. It was delicious and the accompanying sauce was the perfect taste to go along with it. I was almost done with the calamari, then the seafood paella came out. It was not just a ton of rice with a small amount of seafood, it had a great amount. I was very pleased with my choice and I will return to try a few more dishes on their menu."}
