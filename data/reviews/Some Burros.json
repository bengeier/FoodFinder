{"text":"I usually rate this location higher but visit this past week was not a good experience. The young lady who took our order was having an issue with politeness and was very rude.  The regular selections we ordered were substandard...if same person is behind counter on next visit will pass!"}
{"text":"No, just  no!!!! There was a bone in my daughters beef taco, not only gross, but dangerous. The meat was questionable, what kind of meat is this? Where did it come from, why does it look like that? I didn't eat my burrito, it went straight into the trash. This is not real food, go to Taco Bell for much less and higher quality.  Spent 30 dollars on food that no one would eat."}
{"text":"I hit this place right before the lunch rush got into full swing.  I got the two taco combo, and it really hit the spot.  The tacos shells are deep-fried, which gives them a crispiness without allowing them to crumble in your hands the way baked corn shells are wont to do.  Their salsa (they hand you a refrigerated bottle at the register when you place your order) was flavorful and had just the right amount of spice for me.  The side of rice and beans that came with this were just OK...the rice was a bit dry, and the beans a bit watery.  Still, though...you can't go wrong with the tacos.  I had chicken, but the beef ones are every bit as good when I've ordered them in the past.  (As a side note, if you eat in, they apparently bus your table for you.  I was wandering around up front and by the door, trying to find a place to set my tray and dishes, but there isn't one.)  If you're looking for a healthy meal, this is probably not the restaurant you want to end up at.  But, if you're in the mood for simple Mexican fare that has been consistently good over the years at a restaurant that is more upscale than the \"-bertos\" clones, I highly recommend you give them a shot.  My only wish is that they had a location in central Phoenix, but it's probably a good thing for my waistline that I only get to go there once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"The red chili burro is fantastic. Every time. Sometimes this Some Burros takes fooooorrreeevvvveerr to get you your food though. At least, far longer than semi-fast food Mexican should take. It's been more than once. Just sayin."}
{"text":"Red chili burritooooooos. Delicious. However, this one takes forever to complete your order. It's happened more than once."}
{"text":"We had one of the worst meals ever at this location. The chip's were stale and greasy. The shredded beef burrito was smaller than a taco and the meat was day's old and very dry. The lettuce bean's and rice also very old and stale. We will not be going back to this location ever again. Bad food, Bad service. Over priced."}
{"text":"This has gone thru some changes last time I've been here. Now you get metal silver ware and real plates but some how the food got worse. I got the # 7 green chili burro with rice and beans and a child's cheese crisp and my food was kinda gross!! The flour tortilla was not warm nor hot and the green chili looks like dog food.  The food is NOT good. Taco Bell is better than this place."}
{"text":"no real flavor in their food. it was so bland it was unbelievable. the chicken burro had just shredded chicken with some cheese, thats it. I don't know how they call themselves a mexican good restaurant. I will never go there again"}
{"text":"Ate here last sat.  It was decent for a chain.  Had a green chili burro and it was good.  Definitely better than Taco Bell!!  Elmers and Reynosos really set the bar high for Mexican food restaurants, so it's hard for other places to compare.  Clean environment, speedy service, and service with a smile."}
{"text":"Someburros has amazing chorizo, enchiladas, chimichangas, salads, churros, and pretty much anything else you'd want. I love their original Tempe restaurant, and the Chandler restaurant is just as good.  The staff is great and the place is clean and inviting. I couldn't love it more (I come almost once a week.)"}
{"text":"only got one star because I can't give it none.    Ordered Huevos Rancheros, after waiting 20 minutes for our order, it came, with what I believe would, be dripping with grease had it been hot/warm.  But it was cold...both orders had congealed verde/tomatillo sauce.  Though we were quite hungry, we left with nothing touched.  There was nothing good about Some Burros, save your money and head to Del Taco, Taco Bell or any other Americanized Mexican establishment."}
{"text":"I have to say the crew that works here is very immature and the only good thing about this place is the manager with cool hair who has the upmost respect for people other than that this place is terrible for food and upper management needs some work on hiring the right people. Never go here or you will get food poison."}
{"text":"Simple, generic Mexican style food. Nothing out of this world, but I'll say it fixes the cure for a Mexican bite to eat"}
{"text":"The Pollo Fundido is outrageously good.  Light and flaky shell, well seasoned chicken...spot on all around.  I also occasionally will pop in just to get a taco or two if I need to take care of a crunch fix.  Great salsa and I love that it's authentic Sonoran Mexican food without having to commit to a sit down restaurant.  I do have a little hole in the wall Sonoran Mexican joint that's been in Phoenix for 40 years that is slightly better (if not just because of childhood nostalgia), but to cover my bases all over the rest of the Phoenix Rural/Metro area, Someburros gets my vote."}
{"text":"I love it and keep coming back for more! Everything here is good especially the salsa! Excellent bang for its buck! I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"A negative review of Someburro's can only come from the mind of the clinically insane.  Their food is always superb, but most importanly, it's consistent.  It's impossible for me to eat here less than twice a month, so I must maintain an intense workout regimen to offset the calorie onslaught.  I would drink the hot sauce by the gallon if not for fear of liquefying my gastrointestinal system. Having a rough day? A Pollo Fundido or Rod Burro can turn just about anyone's frown upside down in a hurry. The owners have carefully and slowly grown the brand, careful not to compromise quality or consistency.  Bravo for your many years of excellent restaurateuring!"}
{"text":"Someburros has been a family favorite of ours since I was born. We have been going to the location in Tempe my whole life. Their shredded beef tacos are divine, their bean cheese burrito is the absolute best! I know what you're thinking, \"a bean and cheese burrito is kid stuff, and Taco Bell has ruined them for me.\" This burrito is perfection. There is nothing else I want to eat than two tacos and a bean and cheese!"}
{"text":"Salsa tasted like uncooked catchup.  Red sauce on chimi tasted like a salt lick.  The local chain Mexican tastes twice as good."}
{"text":"The customer service at this location was excellent. The cashiers and server were very nice and helpful.   The problem is they cook almost everything in lard and don't seem big on sharing that with customers. We discovered this after asking a few employees, and we were happy that they helped us find something that wasn't cooked in lard. Unfortunately, it ended up being a cold chicken salad with no seasoning, but the customer service was still great."}
{"text":"Tried this Someburros for the first time tonight. Excellent as usual. This is some of the best Mexican fast food you can get. And they make excellent hot sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Love the Pollo fundido!  My wife and I share that along with a folded cheese crisp.   It's like our comfort food.  Yummm!"}
{"text":"Not good at all for catering. I ordered the Fiesta platter and when I picked it up it was stone cold. The guacamole was brown and the taquitos were overcooked.   You are better off going to Nandos and paying a few bucks more for fresh food."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price.  If you're hoping for an authentic taste of Ciudad de Mexico, keep looking.  The menu is actually Tex-Mex, Tacos, Enchiladas, Chimichangas.  Still, the food is always tasty - hard to go wrong, and the staff has is always polite."}
{"text":"I live no where near a Some Burros....and it is probably a good thing...because I would go there way too often!  They are quick, cheap and have some of the best beans out there.  I also have major cravings for the Boracho Burro, which is a green chile beef burro smothered with more sauce and topped with sour cream and guacamole.    I love this place so much I sometimes make up excuses to go to Chandler Fashion Center just so I can eat here!  I sometimes grab takeout if I am in the area for work and bring it back to my office.  They lose a star for not giving you free chips with take-out orders...but other than that...for \"fast food\" they are excellent!"}
{"text":"Always do phone order to save time, accuracy and quality of food is almost always excellent. We've had a few issues when dining in due to wait times (they skipped our order) but have been compensated when these issues occur."}
{"text":"Tasty, fast service, clean restaurant.  Gets a little crazy with the kids sometimes, but they cater to families, so what can you expect?  Shredded beef tacos and pollo fundido are great!  Really like the beans and rice (rice is moist and flavorful)."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, I ordered nachos and I received 6 chips with cheese  and jalepenos that cost me $5. To top that off it was cold when I got it. Worst nachos I have ever ordered."}
{"text":"Great food, always get their machaca shredded beef chimichanga, free drink refills and chips and salsa.  They could use better music stop the selena cd's already! :) 107.1 fm real mexican music (love selena don't get me wrong)"}
{"text":"The crew was great, polite, and very helpful. That's where the positive comments end. I had a  #3 combo which was a tamale and a taco. While waiting for it i ate stale tortilla chips with some of the nastiest salsa I've ever had. Tasted like ketchup with some salt and pepper added to it. My plate arrived and my tamale had 90 percent cornmeal and 5 percent filling... It was terrible, the taco had zero flavor. Do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else. Once again this does not reflect on the employees they were amazing."}
{"text":"First of all, this place serves up White People Mexican Food. WPMF can still be amazing, but it is a different animal, an entire sub-genre with its own set of standards. Anyway, as a white person, I enjoy this stuff. I particularly enjoy the crudo burro, which is actually pretty spicy, and the veggie burro with machaca added. I haven't loved the enchiladas or tamales, but with some reliable menu items and a drive through pick up window, how can I complain? I'm not inclined to dine in restaurants that don't do full service unless I'm traveling, because why, so I can't comment on that experience. For take out though, this is optimally designed. The employees are young but they've been trained well in customer service and are always polite and prompt. I think I've been eating here since jr high/high school and will likely continue as long as I live nearby."}
{"text":"We love Someburros!  Everything we order is fresh and some of the best Mexican food in town.  Tuesday Tacos is a regular routine for our family.  Thank you for being consistently awesome!"}
{"text":"I actually like this place, but today my experience was not good... why? well I can't believe the price of their \"bean and cheese\" is actually more than a beef one? ... on top the beans they added was probably equivalent to a scoop.. mostly toritlla.. what a rip off!  Once again, I do enjoy their food but I better find me a more reasonably priced place.. or one that actually serves what you pay for.."}
{"text":"The tortillas are amazing! The food and ingredients taste SO fresh! I had the veggie burro and it was delicious!!! Very good prices, generous portion size. I love that you order at the counter first and then it's brought out to you. Nice and clean! Nice big patio to enjoy the fall breeze. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Well spiced, big portions, very satisfying."}
{"text":"Some Burros is inexpensive, and that's the best part. The burritos are so-so, the lettuce is a bit suspicious. The refried beans have very little flavor.   The decor is no more than a usual cheap Mexican food joint. It's not trying to be flashy. The eating area is filled with metal chairs and crooked tables. It's usually loud and not very clean.  To maximize your experience get the shredded beef with green chili sauce. Remember: you aren't going to get \"fine dining\", but you'll probably leave full."}
{"text":"On balance it is the perfect restaurant for me. To wit: -It's Mexican, which is the greatest of all food.  -Chips and Salsa at my pace, not when the waiter bothers to come back by (I can just walk up to the counter and get more? That's crazy talk!) -Soda refill at my pace too? No more pacing my Coke Zero consumption so that it's not too full so the waiter ignores it but not too empty that it runs out before he/she does notice it.  -The price is right, which helps ensure the pace of my wallet getting thinner is out done by the pace of my waist getting thicker. -The food is pretty good - it meets my critical \"that will work\" standard. Maybe I've had better, but there is no doubt I've had worse."}
{"text":"Always delicious all the time .Friendly and fast service even when it is really busy.!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch around 2pm on Friday (yes I know I have weird lunch schedule if I need to leave office). Ordered taco salad. When I was asked what kind of dressing, I should've known to change my order. Taste was blah, too much beans, no salsa. Meat tasted like Taco Bell's taco. Not impressed at all. 1 star for food.  Service was average, 3 stars."}
{"text":"As my family will tell you, I tend to lean toward more bland food and can't do spicy.  However, I ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were too bland for even me.  The chicken had no flavor at all and the corn tortillas had the same flavor as cardboard.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the lettuce was good."}
{"text":"Very bland & poor quality food. It was Taco Tuesday,  taco shells were stale & filling was very bland. Burritos not any better. Salsa was even bland. We will never go again."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place.  Was told they had very good mexican food.  We ate here last week and have to say that we didnt like it at all.  The messed up the order a few times and then the food was not much better than taco bell.  Definitely not authentic food.  We will not be going back"}
{"text":"Always good lunch. But dont forget them for breakfast burros. I find there food is good american mexican."}
{"text":"They have really good chips and salsa. The crudo burro was spicy but not too spicy where it takes the flavor of the food.  The carne Asda tacos were ok, nothin to special. The beans were not too good however the rice was tasty."}
{"text":"Amazing food. People are very friendly. This family takes pride in their food that they serve. The employees of this company act as though they care about you and the product they provide. Amazing food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the San Tan location.  They would not honor a coupon on their website and tried to tell me it was only for certain dates, even though it was NOT listed anywhere on the webpage.  The girl that took my call argued with me that there were dates on there, yet wouldn't look herself when I asked her to.  Just lost a long time customer Someburros!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to somburros since the first one opened in Tempe years ago... my husband has traveled all over the world including south of the border and eaten many variations of street tacos.. unfortunately he strayed from his normal meal at this place and tried their street tacos...the meat was as cold as the onion garnish, sent them back and served the 2nd plate the same way...sorry Vasquez family please have them use a thermometer next time since these tacos are premium cost they should at least be warm to hot. Manager refunded our money on the spot thank you for honoring that."}
{"text":"Very expensive for the quality of the food the pollo magnifico had no taste in addition they charge extra for the green sauce with out telling the costumer. That is my opinion."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday with my husband and had the carne asada burro.  Definitely not fast food.  Had to wait over 20 min for 2 burritos.  Hardly any meat or pico de avocado and way too much beans.  It wasn't even wrapped well.  The little meat and pico that was in it was on one side of the burrito.    I've been to the Tempe Some Burros which is SO MUCH Better!!!  Hope they can improve because the Market St location is close to my home."}
{"text":"Classic! Love this place. Home town owners with several locations. Food is soooo yummy."}
{"text":"Beans were nasty, food was bland. I sat a dirty table, I'm not going to waste my time giving this place a long review. Rotten experience!"}
{"text":"Very good food, freshly made.  Been to 3 of their restaurants and have never been disappointed.  Love the atmosphere inside and the outside patio seating is very comfortable. Highly recommended.  Prices are easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Too much grease in their food that almost made me sick one day. They also need more space in between tables because I felt WAY too close to other people."}
{"text":"Good food and pretty fast service.. We like the chimichangas and the chicken tacos. Service was good. Food was fresh.  Fair priced restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time I go for lunch the restaurant is spotless. They must have a designated cleaning staff. A family of four can easily eat well for about $30. The food is always well prepared. Never had a bad meal. Very much traditional Mexican fare."}
{"text":"Best chips n salsa. I wanna take the whole bottle to myself. When I have parties  at home I order the Fiesta platters. Everything here is good. Only reason I gave 4 stars n not 5 is cause one time I went in n they ran out of Pollo fundido. Gave me a regular chicken burrito. I was looking forward to fundido. Anything fried is better right? Fast service..clean restaurant"}
{"text":"The worst \"Mexican\" food I've had, sadly.  It's also the most Caucasian (not counting the likes of Taco Bell).  The second worst was Del Taco, which had a far uglier interior and was in a worse neighborhood, but at least that was edible.  The enchiladas have a massive (ridiculously massive!) amount of white onion inside them, which I hated.  Their red sauce is not flavorful.  Their cheese is very low quality, and greasy too, while the tortillas aren't really anything of note.  This is on my \"won't ever go there again\" list, sadly.  For fast Mexican food just go to Los Favoritos by Bashas' down the street, or run into the mall food court for Rubio's."}
{"text":"I have to downgrade Some Burros.  I have been here a few times since the last review and ordered some of the other items and they just did not measure up to the tacos.    The burrito I ate had an excessive amount of tortilla and not enough carne asada. The Mexican pizza shrunk in size- it was smaller than I recalled and really was not very tasty.  I don't care for their green chile beef, which was a lot spicier than I expected.    And really, the salsa they serve is not very good.  I think Pace Picante tastes better than what they are currently serving."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to decent food. Ordered a green corn tamale and cheese enchilada to go. What a mistake. The green sauce on the tamale was very watery, there was very little cheese, and the tamale was all masa with a few green chilis, no corn or cheese. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"They don't have a lot of vegan options, but they do have bean burrito that pretty tasty. It has avocado and beans only. It's quick, it's vegan, lots of protein, and good! Definitely makes eating vegan easier of busy days!"}
{"text":"I like Someburros.  It's nothing fancy but they have good mexican food and quick service.  The red sauce is tasty.  I would't really travel out of my way to get here, but if I want mexican and I am near by I head in.  They have much better parking at this location than the one on baseline."}
{"text":"We come here every week for Taco Tuesday. This day the counter lady wasn't paying attention and didn't get my order correct. She ruined my one meal out for the week. It was too busy to get it corrected so I had to eat a meal I didn't want. Thabk you for ruining my whole week over lack of attention to detail and actually listening to what the customer wanted. I'd give them a zero star if I could."}
{"text":"This is where my wife and kids like to go after shopping at Target.  They always order shredded beef tacos.  I like their chips and salsa.  It's the perfect amount of heat for me.  Their dining room and bathrooms are always kept clean.    Their staff provides a pretty good level of customer service."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch (@10am) with my coworker friends and this place was amazing!!!  The service was fast and friendly!   The food was delicious. I ordered the mini chimi & it was larger than expected. I also ordered the Pollo Fundido & it was delish!!  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Chicken mini chimis were exceptionally dry. We ordered a corn dog for our toddler. Granted, this is a Mexican food joint, but they served it frozen. We returned it and asked for a new one, and that one came out frozen as well. Very disappointed and probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I am a fan. Fo shizzle. Cute, clean, drive through for pick up orders...ah yeah...indulge my laziness...  My favorite here is the shredded beef crunchy tacos and the mini chicken chimi's with guac although the guac can be hit or miss.   The taco salad with chicken and avocado is the jam too."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food.  The place always clean and kept up.  The staff is nice too and service was quick.  I really like the pollo fondido (sp?).  The other borros are also very good."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice to see if it wold change - the attitude of the guy behind the counter solidified the review.  Not a nice attitude and they don't show you a receipt and charge extra for everything up to four dollars for sauce on top. Just save money and choose a different place to eat."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!  A group of 8 of us stopped in for dinner last night and we a great experience.  None of us had ever eaten here before but we all agreed that we will definitely be back!  I had heard good things about this place but when we pulled up and I saw they had a drive thru I was a little sceptical because we weren't looking for fast food.  Turns out the \"drive thru\" is actually for call ahead orders and this is definitely not fast food!  All of our food was delicious and restaurant quality!  Now can you please build one of these on the west side of town!!!"}
{"text":"This is a typical weekend stop for the family.  I didn't like it much when we first started going but the place has really grown on me.  It is always clean, the kids working there are friendly, it is fast and the prices are good.    My wife always gets a veggie burro that comes with what most places call pico but they call chunky salsa.  Their pico comes with avacod so we always grab a cup of that.  The kids eat rice and beans with the chips and also and always enjoy it.  Their regular salsa is more like a hot sauce.  I rotate through several dishes, the rod burro (probably my fav), the poncho villa, crudo, burracho burro.  All are good.  I don't care for the carna asada burro  - it comes with rice inside and I don't care for that.  The carne asada taco plate is great with some pico or guac.  The pollo fundido is good but not a flavorful as the other burros.  plain and sweetened iced teas are fresh brewed and good (at least the plain tea is I never drink sweet tea)."}
{"text":"We went to this place for lunch and ordered the Carne Asada burrito.  It was okay, there was not a lot of meat in the burrito and for the price we felt we could have gone somewhere else and gotten more for our money.  The chips were kind of stale and they only had one kind of hot sauce.  The employees were really friendly and gave great customer service.  But overall I would probably not come here again for the Carne Asada."}
{"text":"I had heard so many great things about Some Burros I was excited to try them out.  Service was absolutely excellent - wonderful staff, and fast to bring the food out.  Bathrooms are spotless as is the entire restaurant.  But, it kinda goes down hill from there.  Salsas - hot or mild - both \"ho hum\" and sort of flavorless.  The chips were excellent, however!  Then the meal - \"just OK\" in my book - they use that endlessly stringy cheese.  I did notice a lot of people love this place and it does get crowded quickly.  Prices were very cheap!  For me to want to come back, they would need to have better salsa, and ice cold DRAFT beer.  I don't care for bottled beer."}
{"text":"The food is delicious.  I love that they have a pick up window as well for drive through at the end of a long day.  My only negative comments/questions are:  1)  is there a nutritional information sheet somewhere?  I cannot find it online.  and 2)  one time that I ate at Some Burros there was a frizzy, short, wiry, black hair in my burrito.   disgusting.     yeah, what you're thinking it was is the same thing i was thinking and fearing.   ....ok moving on... Normally the food is excellent, Service is friendly.    you always get a free basket of chips with hot sauce.   the green sauce on the burritos is delicious!  if you're from Colorado by chance, I would say Some Burros is similar to El Parrel."}
{"text":"I've been on a enchilada-style veggie burro kick lately so I decided to try Some Burros before going to work last week.  That was a mistake. Not because I had a bad experience, but my meal put me into a sluggish food coma that was difficult to shake. The burrito was pretty good. I liked the whole pinto beans instead of refried beans that I'm used to. The enchilada sauce was on the bland side but the salsa helped that. The onions were overpowering, but the sharp cheddar cheese within and on top of the burrito was very good.  Bonus points for the clean restaurant and fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"With all the good Mexican food in the area, I am surprised this place stays in business. I mean seriously, I can't think of Mexican place that is worse than Some burros. The salsa taste like watered down ketchup with salt pepper and a little spice. My sons cheese quesadilla was scant on the cheese  my carne asada burro was dry and not flavorful at all.   I am usually not this harsh, but I have been here and twice and have been underwhelmed both times."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here but have grown SO tired of their poor customer service and hit or miss food. Twice in the last week, I was craving their food. Both times I stood in a long, slow moving line and wound up leaving. Why does it take so long to order food??? The employees I encounter can barely manage smile. No friendliness, no sense of urgency and no interest in customer satisfaction. Not going to return."}
{"text":"No good ordered a meal no chips in my to go order nothing like the flagstaff store very disappointed thumbs down"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Very good Bean and cheese burrito. Not 5 stars because my albondigas soup was way too salty."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal Some Burros customer for at least 20 years.  My kids don't know that other mexican food exists. We recently moved closer to where the San Tan location is located and we dine there often. Over the years, we have noticed changes, small ones, but we have noticed.  We have noticed that the portions seem to be getting smaller and the prices seem to be going up.  Tonight, we dined at the San Tan location and really noticed these changes.  Ordering the same thing we always do, we noticed that we received less food and paid about $4 more than we have in the past.    We ordered a cheese crisp and it was significantly smaller than in the past and there was hardly any cheese on it.  The side of refried beans was smaller than in the past as well.  I swear the burros are shrinking, too.    While it is great that they are offering breakfast and alcohol for those that want it, are the rest of us paying the price for the new offerings?  And the \"real\" plates and flatware as well?  Losing the waste of the styrofoam plates is a plus for the environment, but I think that the increased cost of using the real stuff is being passed on to the consumer.  I also think that it takes away from the fast food nature of the place.    Don't get me wrong, I love Some Burros and I won't stop going there.  But honestly, it is going to be less frequent if I get less and have to pay more."}
{"text":"Ordered pollo fundido.. it was unedible.  Cut into the burrito and water drained out leaving the burro in a puddle.  Chicken appeared canned.  Hot sauce is good.  Posting a pic to show how the chicken looks."}
{"text":"So, on the spectrum of Taco Bell to Baja Fresh, this was a small step up from Taco Bell. I decide I want to try to get something slightly healthy and start looking at the salads; maybe that was my first mistake. I asked about the Chicken and Avocado salad. The young girl behind the counter said there were beans on the salad. When I asked if they were black or pinto, she said, \"I think they are kinda like pinto.\" Telling me that she really doesn't know the difference . . . maybe something they should cover in training. Side note, the salad did not have beans on it. Something else they might want to cover in training.  Then I asked about the picante salad dressing. The response was a sweet/hot dressing. When the salad arrived, I would have called it PACE Picante. I don't mind PACE, but lets be honest about what is being served.  The chips that they gave me while I was waiting were a little over done, however the hot sauce in the squeeze bottle was pretty good.  Now, some my say it is my own fault for ordering a salad at a place like this, however I think there are plenty of Mexican Food restaurants that have delicious salads, Baja Fresh being one of them. So, if you are looking for a salad, don't go here. If you want a 5 lb burrito to make you sluggish for the rest of the day, maybe it will be good - I wouldn't know. Either way, I won't be going back. Honestly, I'd rather go to Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We often eat here and love it Everytime. I can count on good flavors and prices.   We recently had a catering order in Feb for a bridal shower and it was so much food at a great price. Our out of towners loved it since they don't have one in there. We even used the drive thru window and that was pleasant since I didn't have to get out of the car with my kiddos.  Thanks a great job!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on Saturday, 25 FEB 2017 AD at about 2:35 PM. I ordered a shredded chicken burro and thought it was bland at best. The motif of this restaurant is better than a Taco Bell or Del Taco, but not by much. The food quality I received was sufficient; it would pass the county health department standards for food safety. The dining area was clean. The taste of the shredded chicken burro was bland at best - good thing they give you a BOTTLE of sauce to wash it down with. Yikes!  The cashier that took my order was a teenager and was friendly. She didn't quite get that I wanted a duplicate receipt, but she eventually figured it out.  I would only recommend this place if you like burros and Taco Bell or Del Taco were really busy. There is nothing remarkable about this restaurant. I would've given a \"1 star\" rating but since it was clean, the portion size was right for the price and the people were friendly, I give it 2 stars. And, this restaurant tries hard, they just don't hit the mark.  This is one of the few \"2 star\" reviews I have ever given, however, they warrant it."}
{"text":"Someburros has some tasty Mexican food, but it's usually hell trying to eat inside. If you're okay with a bunch of bratty kids running around and screaming all over the place, then this is the place for you. Other than that, their shredded beef tacos and open cheese crisps are delicious. I don't really understand why they don't throw in chips with to-go orders when they're complimentary inside - especially since you're paying the same amount that you'd pay inside without leaving a table full of dirty plates.   Other than that, they're a bit overpriced but you can usually always expect consistently good quality food."}
{"text":"This my first time here I ordered a Chicken Chimichanga dreaming big. I was greatly disappointed in the portion size for the price. I asked for their \"Hot Sauce\" and it was quite bland and without any kick.   I'll come back to give the beef a try but I don't have great expectations."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and tips before going and they are spot on get the pork fundido. It is great. I called my order in and picked it up through the drive tru in no time. The only problem is the fundido got a little soggy, but still delicious.   The churro is equally as delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food! Sign up for their text alerts and snag some good deals. This place is clean and affordable. Mt favorite is their chicken taco and green tamalew:)"}
{"text":"This place is a bit different than the one in Tempe. They have on the menu Hot Tea, but when we asked the girl for Tea she said, we don't have that! But, it is on the menu, she said, it is??? Their  menu is up on the wall. So then we said, ok how about coffee? (also on the menu)  She said, well, we have to make it. OK never mind. Other than that the food is very good, the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is nice and clean. it is worth the visit, their salsa is great!"}
{"text":"Meh. It's ok but nothing really distinguishable from any average Americanized Mexican place. Got a taco salad and Machaca. Salad was good, Machaca was very bland. Best part of it was the sauce that came with the chips.  Slightly better than taco bell,  but more expensive."}
{"text":"Delicious as always!   I love their tacos, burritos, and rice and beans. The price is right for a quick lunch! Chips and salsa are always on point."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food tastes great- I like  that they have a whole bean burrito with avocado slices in it.  Their iced tea is good too.Plus they sell a great refillable cup and you get a much cheaper drink when you bring it with you. I use the cup all the time too at my desk. They also recently started using regular plates and silverware in the restaurant, reducing trash.  love when chain restaurants do this. It shows that you can still make a profit and reduce waste.  You can also call in your order and use the drive thru window to pick it up. that's convenient!  The only reason I dropped off a star on the rating is this- if you order food there you get a side of chips included. If you order food to go you have to pay for the side of chips. What the heck is that about?"}
{"text":"We love Someburros!  I have been going to their restaurants for 25 years.  This location is newer and nicer then the Tempe location by far.   You order at the counter and they bring your meal to you.  The food is not greasy for Mexican food, it comes quickly, is warm, and delicious!  The food is also cheap,  They give you a ton of chips while you wait, and they will refill them at the counter if you ask.  I like the bean burro a la carte, but everything here is good.  They also serve beer too if you want.  Try their party platters, they are reasonably priced and great for football season.  They also can be picked up a few hours after ordering.  Also try their Xmas tamales."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate there for the first time...She had mold on her tortilla.  We quietly brought it to the attention of a server...A manager came and made every excuse in the world of why it was not mold...She never offered to comp the meal or at least the tortilla...She just kept telling us that she did not actually know what mold looked like...Well I am a mom...I have seen a moldy tortilla. I could not finish my meal.  Her lack of care is the reason of such a low rating...accidents occasionally happen...but we will never ever be back.  The Manager had such a lack of training ...We will tell everyone we know of our horrible experience! I do want to ad that our server was really nice and so was the young lady who took our order...I seriously would have fired that manager on the spot!"}
{"text":"We have always liked their food. Sevice was slow. Today the food was not good. Steak tacos were dry. Refried beans tasted like they were sitting around all day."}
{"text":"So disappointed!!! My husband and I have wanted to try this place for years now & we finally did tonight. Their food has absolutely no flavor other than greese!!! I was so sad and kinda pissed for wasting my money and my Mexican food fix on this place. I had the chicken taco and a carne asada taco. My husband had an enchilada, chicken tostada, and carne asada taco. Both my kids had chicken taquitos. My two year old actually spit hers out. All terrible ! Hot sauce just tasted like tomato juice. I WILL say that the churro was delicious and they were fast but we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I enjoy their chicken burrito or chicken bean burrito. Shredded chicken and a tortilla. No cheese or anything else is on it, but I can have big lunch for $5. Pretty simple but a good flavor. The chicken appears to be a decent quality. I've tried the chicken fundido which was excellent but so bad for you (deep fried plus spicy sour cream sauce) that I very rarely order it.   That being said, I've tried other items and didn't like them at all. My husband can't find anything he likes here so I only come here if I'm out shopping and get hungry for chicken other than Chick Fil A.  Their salsa (maybe better called a red sauce rather than salsa) is very bland. You can ask for a green sauce that's hot and spicy but the request seems to confuse them. Sometimes they charge us, other times they flat out refuse to give us any and other times we get it without issue. Weird!  Anyway, if you want traditional Mexican don't come here! If you want bland Americanized Mexican food, you might like it."}
{"text":"I ordered food for 40 people this past weekend and when I got there to pick it up I was shocked to see how small little there was. This was not going to feed 40! The manager told me that their serving sizes are based on what they presume a person eats, which is (1) serving size... What?!  You mean most people don't serve themselves twice?? I know I do. I ordered Chile Verde and it did not look like Chile \"Verde\" it was a brown ugly color and not green???  All the food was Waaaaaay too salty and I was very embarrassed by it!!  I will Never order from Somburros Ever again!!!"}
{"text":"Going downhill, out of the last 10 pick up orders 4 have been wrong. I wish they had the hygiene standards In & Out Burger has, hair tied back, and no camel toe uniforms, seems the staff is more interested in looking trashy instead of professional, items getting smaller, image speaks volumes, going downhill - disappointing but plenty of other places to choose from in the area"}
{"text":"If you want Sonoran style comfort food, you can find it at Someburros.  I've been going to Someburros since the original location opened in Tempe, and in fact worked there while I was in college.  Over the years, I've been to all the east valley locations and still go once or twice a month with my family.  It's been pretty much consistent, except for prices (which is expected - everything costs more everywhere every year!).  I have found people either love it or hate it.  Those who love it, usually love it forever."}
{"text":"I don't think you can go wrong with anything you choose to order here. Our red Chile beef chimichanga, shredded beef taco and enchilada were all loaded with meat and very tasty. Even the salsa and guacamole were very good. Drive thru is for phone order pick ups only. 726-Taco"}
{"text":"The food is just terrible. Definitely not worth the money. As much as I hate taco bell, it tastes better than this garbage."}
{"text":"Just gross. First and last time here. Ordered huevos rancheros. No extra tortillas but the ones under the eggs were driiiipppiiiinnngggg with grease. No taste to the sauce and unappetizing color. No rice served either. What mex restaurant only has one kind of hot sauce, which doubles as salsa?  Poor excuse for a restaurant period."}
{"text":"Wolf. I wouldn't feed this to my dog. Probably wouldn't even feed this to someone I didn't like.   If you like ungodly amounts of canned refried beans and reheated cardboard tasting frozen food then maybe this is your spot. Otherwise, please, I beg you, don't stop at this place.   We spent $23 on two combo meals, took a good look at them when they came, and against our better judgment took a bite. Wish we hadn't. First time I've walked out on a meal.   Enough said."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed with the service!!! I will not be back. The 12 year old in charge at the counter needs training in managing her people and treating customers with respect instead of making excuses. I was the ONLY person in line and 6 employees behind the counter...I had to ask to get service and then the young lady in charge gave me an excuse why the young man closest to me didnt see me. Ugh!!! How about a quick...Gosh I'm so sorry, what can we get you?"}
{"text":"PORTION SIZE!  I just left Some Burros thoroughly disappointed.  I placed a telephone order for a bean and cheese burrito with no issues and advised my total would be $4.46.  My order was completed in ten minutes as promised.  The burrito was about the size of a 99 cent FROZEN BURRITO from the grocery store.  I have seen larger burritos at Taco Bell.  There are many other options in the area.  Go somewhere else and don't get ripped off."}
{"text":"Beans and tortillas are really good. Prior to this visit I had only had tortillas from here and now that I came to eat I'm questioning myself why it took me so long to come try it out. Will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent food for the money. Hard to beat the chicken tacos and burros."}
{"text":"I have given this place the last chance.  Chili Verde tostada was cold, flavorless, slop.  The tortilla burned beyond recognition, my guest had a brown, disgusting tamale, with an egg perched on the top with a slop of beans, tasteless except for the grease....I exchanged mine for chicken, avocado salad, no spice, no imagination, I threw 17 bucks away....and I feel screwed over by a substandard unimaginative mess....I am so sick of horrible Arizona Mexican food."}
{"text":"I'd go to Taco Bell before I'd go back to Some Burros. Food order was wrong, tamales were bland, and tacos fell apart the moment they were picked up. Back to Serranos we go."}
{"text":"Honestly, just go to Taco Bell.   We decided to give this place a try and I rarely say that I regret eating food...but I totally regret eating this food.  First indication that we should've turned around and left: every single worker behind the counter (4 of them) looked like they absolutely hated their job.   I ordered a carne asada burrito since the cashier recommended it. Blah. It was a tiny burrito for $8 and had almost no flavor. The tortilla looked like the raw tortilla you buy from Costco and fry up yourself...except this one wasn't fried or warm even. In fact all the food we ordered was barely warm by the time it arrived at our table. I've never been to a Mexican restaurant and thought, \"I'm not full from my entree so I'll just fill up on these remaining tortilla chips.\" No, because it's always the opposite - you don't want to fill up on the chips because you want to devour your tasty, tasty Mexican food entree. Well, here at Some Burro I *actually* tried to scarf tortilla chips AFTER my meal so I could kind-of-maybe-just-a-little-bit be full. No dice. And crappy chips (all crumbs - WTH?).  I have nothing positive to say about this place. I regret spending $20 for my family to eat here. None of us were full and very far from being satisfied.  The biggest puzzling part: the restaurant was pretty full. Why?! No clue. Horrible food.  Save your money and your taste buds and if you want semi-Mexican food go get Taco Bell. It's better than this place."}
{"text":"Came here w/ the hubster's. I've actually been craving this for some time now. The pollo fundido is great! So goooooood! Its a pretty big portion. The rest of the food looks really fresh too. The best part is that they have churros!   Great prices and food!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the other Someburros locations, but at the Chandler location, the employees are always SO RUDE. Most of the time, we have orders to go, and they are the only location that says they will not add a boat of chips to our order. If I'm paying $35 for dinner, I'd like boat or two of chips..its not a lot. It's the exact amount I'd get (for free) if I unloaded my car and we all ate inside. They act like they have to ground the corn and fry the chips themselves."}
{"text":"Probably my least favorite \"Mexican\" food place around. The only thing that's good there is their tortillas! But anyways, I called in a to-go order for my family and I ordered  myself a bean burrito with rice, pico, and lettuce. I get home with my order, sit down, take a bite and I get a mouthful of guacamole! I'm allergic to avocados mind you. So I call back the next day to try to maybe get a refund or just a new burrito, I didn't get either. They informed me that their pico is made with avocados(what kind of pico is that) and they said next time I should do my research and basically that it was my fault!! Maybe you should inform people that you don't have pico de Gallo and that you have guacamole!! Shoutout to Bianca the manager!! She was SUCH a BIG help! (NOT!)"}
{"text":"Normally our service at Someburros is prompt.  Tonight was a little different.  My husband inquired with one of the employees about the delay.  Tanya (sp?) immediately checked on our food.  It was brought out soon after along with an apology for the delay.  Tanya also offered compensation for our trouble.  We were thoroughly impressed with this level of customer service and extremely satisfied with the outcome. Many businesses could learn a thing or two about customer satisfaction from Someburros."}
{"text":"Fantastic! This is a \"go-to\" place for me. I eat here a few times a week. My wife and I have had several things on the menu; everything has always been great. Great Mexican food spot."}
{"text":"Eh. Better then Taco Bell. That's not saying much, though.  You ask what motivated me to come here?  Apparently they arbitrarily decided that Friday (7/24) was \"National Margarita Day\".  In actual fact there is a National Margarita Day, and it's Feb 22.  But when they declare an all-day happy hour, fine...it's \"National Margarita Day\" as far as I'm concerned.  So we get one each of the two types of margarita they sell, plus they had $3 appetizers.  So we ordered the mini chimis, taquitos, and red chile beef cheese crisp.  Plus a side of rice.    I did NOT like the cheese crisp.  Ever smell chili powder?  That's what the red beef tasted like.  Chili powder.  My wife was a bit more forgiving, but I stopped after about 1/2 piece.  The mini chimis were fine.  Nothing special.  In fact, less than nothing special.  \"Underwhelming\" leaps to mind.  The taquitos tasted like those Delimex ones at Costco...you know, the ones they sample in the store trying to get you to buy the 2000 taquito box in the case behind them?  Yeah, those.  Again, totally underwhelming.  But the rice was flavorful.  I liked that.  The margaritas were sad.  It's a good thing we only paid $1 for them or I'd be upset.  But, after years of seeing this place, I've finally tried it and proven that I was correct not to come here before.  I won't be coming back, either.  Better than Taco Bell, sure.  But why would you want to do either?  Even with \"happy hour\" pricing it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Someburros used to be good...not anymore.  They've cut down on what you get and charge more.  The mild sauce is so watery now, you can drink it.  No more tomatoes as garnish for pollo fundido and the amount of sauce on top and rice on the side has been greatly reduced.  They should have never messed with a good thing.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok food. My kids and husband love to to eat here. I'm on the fence about it. The last couple times I've eating here I've found hair in my taco once and then in my guacamole on another visit. Two different visits. Both times I've showed management and they offered to replace my food but I didn't want my another plate. Now on this recent visit we we we're sitting in the corner booth and my son dropped his crayon on the floor. He started to scream and we looked and it was a huge dead cockroach. So gross. I've informed management and they said, \"We will call Pest Control.\" That was it. So yeah. I am so done eating at this location."}
{"text":"Quality food for reasonable prices, clean, and quick service.  I have enjoyed Someburros food since 1989 at their original location on Mill.  It's one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"My bf told me that this is the best Mexican food place that's good around here. He particularly likes their chimichanga. I decided to order something simple like 3 rolled tacos. You can't really mess up on that since it's so easy to make, right? I didn't like the rolled taco shell, it was very hard and wasn't very tasty. The meat inside was good. I just tore apart the shell and ate the meat inside only. The rice was pretty good, that's usually my favorite. When you order, they give you chips and a bottle of their hot sauce or salsa which I didn't find spicy at all.   Overall, I've had better Mexican food elsewhere. Their rolled tacos aren't really anything special. I mean the ones you find frozen at Costco tastes way better than the ones I had. Not authentic Mexican food. They should have a variety of hot sauces/salsas like most Mexican places does.  When you order, they give you a number to put on your table and your meal gets delivered to you. When you're done, you just leave your dishes there and someone will pick them up and clean them for you."}
{"text":"I've been going to Someburros with my family since it first opened in Tempe on Baseline & Mill way back in 1986 or so. I live in Chandler now so we go to this one most of the time. It's good food. I like the tacos, the pollo fundido, the green chili, the rod burro, the refried beans, and the rice. It's not 5 star food but it's 4-star and that beats a lot of the others. We like casual dining so this place works for us."}
{"text":"all around solid mexcan food restaurant. if you're looking for authentic though I'd look somewhere else this is Caucasian style mexican food."}
{"text":"I love Some Burros!  The food is always on point and you know you're getting some legit tasty Mexican food.  I had a not-so-great catering experience (they forgot my order, or something, but they were SUPER busy with catering orders, so I was being understanding).  The manager was working to do everything she could to get my order ready but I still waited an hour past the pick up time.  She ended up refunding me my whole order and still came through with the food.  I didn't ask for a refund, she just knew it was the right thing to do.  And that, means so much.  A business/person that knows what is right and wrong and does it, that's a good business.  I would definitely come back and despite the mishap, I am a fan for sure."}
{"text":"Love their food. So excited for the Queen Creek location to open. We will be there for the grand opening."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Arizona, and I basically grew up eating Someburros, so it is a bit of a \"comfort food\" for me.. I always have to get it at least once when I'm back in town! So take my review for what it's worth...  This was my first time at this location, but it seemed clean inside. I only ordered 2 bean burritos for myself and my friend, and took them to go. Service was super friendly, food came out quickly, and the burritos tasted exactly like I was hoping for and expecting."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!  Waited 15 mins for my food and it was garbage! Carne was old and tough. Fish taco was way over cooked. Bunch of kids running that place. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"If by burrito you mean a large corn tortilla taco then I guess some burritos are not created equally. Terrible and bland taste, nothing like what I expected. I probably should have read some reviews before ordering. Everything including salsa costs extra... I literally walked out without eating."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mexican food I have ever had.  The \"green sauce\" was tasteless white gravy goop.  The salsa tasted more like ketchup than salsa.  We saw a clip on the news about the family and thought how cool.  Never again.  I left 3/4 of my enchilada on the plate and all the chips.  Too bad!"}
{"text":"Perfect comfort Mexican food. The place has a very casual and open layout. Walk in order at the counter and they bring it to your booth or table. The food style is a very American look with a Mexican taste. I love to order the taco salads or the shredded beef tacos. They give you a basket of chips to go with your order and some red salsa. Great place to bring a large group or enjoy a booth for two. Prices are reasonable. Pro tip: They have taco Tuesday specials."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Someburros since the early 90's in Tempe.  It has been great to see them open up more facilities in SE valley.. The big plus is the fact that their food is consistently delicious on all 4 sites.. My favorite is the Beef Chimi with Red Sauce.. You can't go wrong.. Oh, how can I forget.. Their chips and sauce are very addicting.."}
{"text":"Always have had good experiences here and good food. Enjoyed this evening and it was more of the same. Never blown away by the service, the only thing keeping it from a 5 star, but the food is always good."}
{"text":"My favorite is the Pollo Fundido... better than anywhere around! Highly recommend getting their loyalty cup!"}
{"text":"Horrible food! Enchilada tortilla was hard and cheese was so greasy and sauce had no taste to it. Chips were stale and salsa supposedly made fresh everyday taste like some tomato paste. Our family hasn't been here in awhile and I see they remodeled the restaurant. They needed to take that $ and use it to try to create better food instead of better decorations. I'm so mad I spent $40 of my hard earned money on this place. I will never come back and I suggest going somewhere else. Don't waste your time or money on this horrible place."}
{"text":"First time coming here to eat, the line was pretty long, and a huge birthday party was going on as well. Thinking our food would take firever, I was definitely wrong! Not only was my chicken fundido super moist and delicious it came out not even four minutes after we sat down! Then they were having seasonal horchata advertise but we didn't want to buy a whole thing if we ended up not liking the flavors, so we asked the girl who served us our food if we get a sample and she wasn't sure, but asked anyways. As busy as it was we thought she forgot about us because 10 minutes had passed by but then she came over with the samples and the salted caramel horchata was delicious! My boyfriend got two different burritos with shredded beef and it was super tender and juicy I couldn't stop taking it off of his plate lol. For a fast food sit down type chain it was definitely delicious!"}
{"text":"I love some burros we go there often, my biggest problem is... I don't eat meat. But when I order rice I always find chunks of meat in it! I've asked on several occasions if there is supposed to be meat in it and every time I've been told no. The cooks need to be more careful for how they serve food."}
{"text":"I miss eating yummy authentic Mexican tacos...so I try to find places that will at least come close to it.  I know I was in for a disappointing moment when I walked in and noticed this place was a chain.  Well I was already there so I ordered.  I asked about the beans and whether or not they use lard (I don't eat pork) and the cashier guy...young white guy had no idea what I just asked him.  I understand that he can't know everything about the food they serve...but beans at a Mexican restaurant...you should know this. Anyway so I asked the other employee and he said yes they do use lard and so I said k so I don't want anything with beans then...and so I said k give me the Carne Asada Burro....and surprise!!!  when I get home...I see it's smeared with beans... Now...don't get me wrong...I don't expect a cashier at a fast food joint to be a genius...I don't even expect him to be sober...but what I did assume is that he would know to tell me if this freaking thing had beans since I just literally said no beans.  I didn't eat it cause of the beans but my friends ate it and said whatever it's same thing as a frozen burrito you heat up.    Again.  I understand this is my fault for not being very specific and clear but goodness me for expecting a sliver of something from that employee."}
{"text":"The food is good here as long as you manage your expectations. Nothing real creative and pretty much the same Sonoran Mexican dishes you get pretty much everywhere else. The staff are usually very young and need to work on their people skills. Having said that, the food has never disappointed me."}
{"text":"Great food amazing salsa truly love this place their nachos are fantastic the red and green chili his mouth amazing as well as carne asda burro"}
{"text":"It was definitely an odd Sunday. We wanted tacos and ended up going to 2 other places that were closed. So, we found ourselves going through what we thought was a drive through, only it was actually for preordered pick ups.   The lady in the window was very kind. She explained it was pickups and offered a few menus so we could decide on what we wanted. Once she took our order, she asked that we loop around so that other customers could pick up their food while ours were being made.   We did just that and took our meals home to eat. We live about 6 minutes away from this location and I began eating immediately. I ordered the carne asada burrito enchilada style and my guy ordered a burrito that came enchilada style with green sauce.  Upon first opening my plate, first taste, I was no sure how I felt. The sauce tasted a bit molé and was lacking in flavor and flare. It was mediocre. I bite into the burrito which has tons of tortilla folded up. It was like a soggy bready tortilla, that's the only way I can explain it. I couldn't decide if it had been fried or not but it just wasn't all that. The carne inside was cubed and bleck. Dry, old, over cooked? I'm not sure. Not to mention it was cold. Like colder than a 6 minute drive should allow. I knew they couldn't have just handed me whatever since we ordered it on the spot.   I didn't try the other burrito but my Love tasted mine and indicated that his was virtually the same but with Greek sauce. His also had avocado and sour cream but somehow, they still tasted the same. I wish I had seen the option for rice and beans because I ended up not eating my burrito because of how disappointed I was.   It was bland and just whatever. The man mentioned as he ate it he remembered their food always tasting as though it was lacking something, everything.... I am glad I tried it now but based on this go round, I am likely to not want to try it again."}
{"text":"Its Sat night, and we have ran around all day and the last thing I wanted to do was cook some dinner, so I asked my son and daughter what do they want for dinner and they just looked at me with the deer in the headlight look, so I knew it was up to me to find the place.  I remembered that Some Burros was next to the Chandler Mall, now I have had Some Burros before, use to work near by the one on baseline & mill & sometimes work has them cater events, and once the thought Some Burros got into my head I was craving their hot sauce, have you tried it yet? Omg it's a good hot sauce, goes perfectly with chips and food.  So I told them that's where I am headed, so off we went. My daughter ordered 2 beef tamales with red sauce & beans & rice, my son had the carne asada burro with beans & rice and they both liked their dish, my son even said he will go back, and that's a big deal because he is a picky teenager haha  I had the pollo fundino, the chunks of chicken were very tender, the flour tortilla was fried perfectly, not too hard & not to soft, oh but that jalapeno cream cheese is to die for! Love that stuff!!   It was the perfect dinner for a sat night!"}
{"text":"Nothing Special.  Just another ok Mexican place in Arizona.  Blah"}
{"text":"This place is the worst for to go orders. The kid answering the phone sounds like he's in a hurry to hang up. So annoying!!! Plus no chips when they are free inside. I find it hard to believe this place is family owned with the crappy service."}
{"text":"Bad experience! Food was bland. Walked in, ordered our food and looked for a table. No where to sit, 5 tables  were covered with dirty dishes. So I asked the woman at the counter if someone could clean some tables. She nodded and totally ignored my request. I asked another guy standing around doing nothing if he could clear some tables. We finally cleared a table ourselves. The cheese crisp lacked flavor as well as the cheese enchilada. Must be using a very low quality cheese. Food was very bland overall. Margarita was weak and no tequila taste at all. I won't be back. Sorry I just call it like it is."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat lunch, food is good quality and the breakfast burrito's are great. Gets busy during lunch time but if the weather is nice you can always sit outside. Staff is friendly and you don't have to wait too long for them to bring you your food. Overall good place to eat"}
{"text":"I found the food very good and the service even better. We don't eat out mexican food often but this place is worthy of us returning in the rare events we do. And fyi, we don't eat out mexican for the fact that my fiance is mexican and cooks damn good like one. Lol"}
{"text":"Very good food! We ordered and picked up a few platters for a party on Saturday. The prices weren't bad and the guests loved the food. The mini chimi's and quesadilla's were a favorite! Wish we had gotten rice and beans since the serving sizes didn't quite cover it! If you're ordering for a party, I'd suggest buying even more than you think. The food went fast!! Glad we choose this place, it was a hit!"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite! The salsa is so tasty & has good heat, which is why it is one of my all time favorites.  The Buracho burrito is my \"go-to\" and hard tacos are as good as any!  I need to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"This was my first time and will be my last time I ask if they switch hard to soft and then said no I would not recommend coming here"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food gave me a headache and stomach ache. Will never eat there again.  Had the Borracho Burro."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite place since I was a child. This location has always been a favorite although it can be crowded at certain times. I always get the veggie burro but yesterday I decided to try the chorizo burrito and I was weary and the girl on the phone said that if I didn't like it, that I could call her back and she would take care of it. Great customer service!! It was delicious!!"}
{"text":"OMG the salted carmel horchata is so good. I had the mini chimis with rice and beans and it didn't disappoint. My food was good, but there are other Mexican food places in the area that are better. However for the price point and portion size I give Someburros 4 stars. My husband thought his food was ok. We will go back to try other things and are looking forward to the new location in QC to open. I gave one star extra for the salted carmel horchata."}
{"text":"I've had mexican food at several (okay... a lot) of different places in the 4 years that I've lived in Arizona. This place was \"A-OK\", just as the 3-star rating I gave would imply.   This location has a drive-through window, but we came to learn, you can't order from the drive through window - it's only there for people to pick up phone orders. So, we went inside. The young employee at the counter couldn't have shown any less enthusiasm about her job. She was mumbling and I had to ask her to repeat a couple of her questions to us. We got our food within 5 minutes and took it home to devour it as we were both pretty darn hungry.   I got the 2 tacos and rice meal - one chicken taco and one beef taco. The beef was very dry, but the chicken was pretty darn good. The tacos were only topped with lettuce.   The food was good, but I think pretty \"average\" for mexican food in Arizona. I'm sure I'll be back (mostly because my boyfriend was saying \"nom\" in between bites of his burrito and it's so close to our house. haha)."}
{"text":"Some Burros is hard to beat for cheap and unhealthy Mexican.  Even a place like Filiberto's that competes strictly on price is an afterthought for me.  I can go to Some Burros for almost the same price, and while the portions are smaller than Fili, you actually get decent food.    I really like the red burro with beans.  The lean beef chunks are stewed until they are fork-tender.  I also really like the beef and potato tacos, which is a combo that can be hard to find.  They have a lot of tasty options on the menu to keep you coming back.  However, I try not to eat here more than once a month or so, as it's carb and fat overload to eat at a place like this often."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of Some Burros!  I travel often for work and am only one one a couple days a month and during those couple days my diet consist of Some Burros.  If you haven't had their Pollo Fundido then stop wasting your time and try it.  I usually ask them to give me half rice and beans instead of a full portion of one or the other.    I have to admit the last time I was here their salsa was a bit off.  I didn't taste the same.  it was disappointing considering that if I could I would drink it straight from the bottle.   Seriously though, come in, sit down and enjoy some great Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is always a treat. Been here more times than I can count. Always start off with the complimentary  chips and salsa. LOVE the salsa. Usually order the Pollo Fundido because of its jalapeño cream cheesy goodness. Yum! Then I finish off by splitting a churro with the kids...because I'm eating healthy. Lol. Togo drink cups are perfect too. Price is right. A little higher than a taco stand but you get what you pay for. Friendly service and nice atmosphere. Always be back!"}
{"text":"My coworkers usually pick up food to go.  I have never experience dining in until recently.  I was very surprised to see that they service complimentary chips.  Nice!  I had the crunchy taco, normally at other places (Filiberto's) its greasy and soggy but at Some Burros it was super crunchy.  The red chili burrito is amazing, it isn't bland, its very tasty.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, and tasty Mexican food.  I ordered a kids meal cause I wanted a churro (it was not good ha) and also a smothered burrito.  The tortilla was really good, tasted fresh and homemade.  Not sure if it was though.  And the chile was great.    Busy on Sunday after church so we had to stalk other tables and sit down right when they stood up.    Pretty hot inside, but It's AZ...what do I expect right?"}
{"text":"Great casual Mexican restaurant . Our favorite is Serranos ... But when we need a quick bite closer to home some burros is our go to spot . You get chips and salsa while you wait for your food. And your drinks are self arrive .Both the chips & salsa are ok .. Nothing fantastic . Onto the Burros . They are dynamite! My fav is the rod burro . It's 1/2 green sauce ,1/2 red sauce . On the red 1/2 chorizo is mixed in with the beef and red sauce .. It's so good and a bit spicy which is why I like to start with the red side and finish with the green. Once you bite into the green side it cools your mouth instantly with its creamy green chili goodness .. I have been wanting to try other items but I just can't!!"}
{"text":"To be honest, I have not tried a lot of items at Someburros but what I have tried would not bring me back for more.   On my last visit I had asked the cashier what he would recommend on the menu. He gave me a few of his favorites and I decided to go with the machaca shredded beef burro with red sauce. We also got chips and salsa with our order. When the burrito came out it was hot and when I cut into it, it shot out piping hot liquid right on my lap. Not necessarily the burritos fault but still not a good start. The burrito itself was a salt disaster. The amount of salt in burrito tasted as though they went over to the pacific ocean, dipped it in a few times and let it dry. The salt lick burrito is what it should be called. I know that sounds harsh but it is an accurate description, at least on this visit.  The good thing is that the manager did replace it with a bean and cheese burrito. It was okay. I would not come back for it. The service was good so they do deserve credit for that.  Mostly I just feel like things are prepared before hand, frozen and then reheated. I'm sure that is the case in many restaurants like this but unfortunately Someburros just does not do well. I might be back to try other items and to give them another shot. But for now, I'm just not feeling it."}
{"text":"Perhaps this place should be called \"Somewhat Burros\". First time at this location, been a handful of times at the North Scottsdale one.   First the good: clean restaurant with fairly friendly service and food at reasonable prices. The portions are large, especially the burritos, so perhaps Some Burros is aptly named.    The mediocre: the meal I had today was perhaps the worst I've had at this chain. Putting that in perspective, it was Mexican food in a semi-fast food setting. It isn't Taco Bell but not fine dining either. Our meal was cheese enchiladas. The plate came with beans, rice, two enchiladas and a sprinkling of shredded lettuce. The food itself was so hot when it arrived we had to wait at least 5 minutes to take our first bite. The enchiladas were dry with little sauce and as they cooled off in order to eat them the cheese hardened on the inside. This has never happened to me at any other restaurant, where I think that the right amount of sauce and cheese keep the enchiladas melted as you eat them.  One small think I found hugely annoying. You order at the counter, are given a tray with chips (nice) and your drinks are filled. We ordered two large sodas. They place the filled-to-the-brim cups on your tray without lids (apparently they don't have any at the counter) and are sent on your way. Huge spillage potential, especially if you have to navigate by other people in line on your way to find a table."}
{"text":"Well I heard this place was pretty good but this is my first time here so I have to write another review on that. I give this place 4 stars off the bat because I wanted a specialty burro and the girl at the counter was so helpful in building my perfect burro and on top of that a patron paid for it...I don't eat at work so I stop for dinner on way home and people pay for my stuff sometimes, so I'm just go home and change before grabbing a bite to eat cause it like what do I say, can only say thank you so many times."}
{"text":"Haven't gone wrong here yet. Clean, fast and the food is pretty authentic. I'm from Tucson AZ and living in Phoenix now, which dosent have much in the way of authentic mexican food. But this place gets close."}
{"text":"I thought the hot sauce was great. But the chips were not warm and sort of stale. I got the # 11. Three rolled tacos rice beens. It was ok. Not very big. Not very tasty.... the hot sauce must be used a lot. I guess I just feel it was too much money. The meal plus small drink was 10.16! Kind of a lot for what really is a lunch sized portion. I was not impressed."}
{"text":"When I used to work on the east side of town, there were a few locations for me to pick from, so I would stop in for SomeBurros for lunch all the time. It looks like they now have a location in Scottsdale, which is closer to me now, so I am def going to check them out again.  This place has some really good spicy sauce that they serve with chips. It has a unique favor. It isn't chunky, but it really really tasty. I consider SomeBurros another one of those hybrid places that is \"fast food\", but still gives you chips and salsa. I am a big fan of this place. If there was one closer to my house, I would def add it to my regular rotation of Mexican food places to go to.  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a good priced, but quality fast food Mexcian food place. It is quite better than the \"bertos\" and other fast food places."}
{"text":"Someburro's is hands down the best fast Mexican food in Phoenix!  Friendly staff, great food and atmosphere. I love the chicken taco! The prices are acceptable and there are always dollar off and buy one get one coupons floating around. This is a must eat if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Someburros was the official restaurant of choice of the elementary school I taught at in Chandler. With good reason. The bean and chicken burrito will change your life."}
{"text":"Carne asada burro has rice only, a very small portion of beans and only two or three small pieces of carne asada on my burro."}
{"text":"In a hurry? Craving semi-authentic Mexican food- with an emphasis on great burritos? Wallet feeling a bit light? Then Some Burros is probably a good place to be. This local chain has been around for many years and does many things right to earn its longevity. For their prices, you really get a great meal with large portions, excellent quality, and a variety of flavors/tastes! If you like chicken and sour cream, try the Pollo Fundido. It's just the right amount of heat and flavor for any set of taste buds. Their in-house red hot sauce is really great and pairs well with just about every menu item- don't be surprised if your slatering it all over your plate too! The menu options are bountiful, and there are some great kid options as well. If you're in a hurry, you can call ahead to place your order and then drive-thru 10 minutes later to pay for, and pick-up your order. The young staff has always been helpful and friendly- ready to answer your questions and give some advice on what menu items they'd recommend. Check it out if you're in the mood for \"fast food\" Mexican style! And make sure you get your burrito served enchilada style with lots of red or green sauce!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I when I go to a place for the first time and love it... then the next time is a let down. That's what happened here. I loved the Flagstaff one, and this location the first time. But I am super disappointed today when my food felt like it came out of the fridge. May be back in a few months, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat for authentic Mexican food.  Their tacos are excellent especially their shredded beef and shredded chicken.  I also am a big fan of their folded cheese crisps.  Their tamales are just so-so though."}
{"text":"Horrible salsa and awful, stale chips. Mediocre fish tacos and they don't have black beans! Seriously?"}
{"text":"My wife and I just went here and were impressed with the cleanliness and overall atmosphere. She ordered the green corn tamale and cheese enchilada plate. I ordered the Diablo Scramble which included chorizo, eggs, potatoes, cheese, jalapenos, refried beans and warm tortillas. Everything was very good and I couldn't even finish it. My wife enjoyed everything except the cheese enchilada, which she couldn't finish. I must admit that their cheese was pretty poor quality. Otherwise, we enjoyed our breakfast and will be returning. Mariachi music added to the experience."}
{"text":"Call it non-authentic, chained-out, garbage Mexican food, Someburros it is what it is. And I actually really enjoy the place.   My \"Mom in Law\"  frequently orders Someburros party platters of their mini chimis, flautas, burros, etc. for our annual family Christmas Eve gathering, graduation parties, you name it. For what this place is, that's always been exceptionally delicious.   I especially love their chips and that amazing hot sauce that goes good on anything!   After spending most of the afternoon volunteering (and didn't do our weekly grocery shopping yet, whoops), Dude and I decided to get dinner before attempting to walk into a grocery store HANGRY!    This location is always very clean, has friendly counter service. And the chips are free, boom!  Decided to venture off into the deep end having not had much else other than the party platter.   Ordered that famous Pollo Fundido several of my Yelp friends (and many other) have raved about.   Marinated chunks of chicken breast wrapped in a flour tortilla, then deep fried and smothered in jalapeño cream cheese, grated cheddar and green onion.   Dude had the Rod Burro, filled with green and red chili beef, refried beans, chorizo, and capped off with both red and green enchilada sauces and melted cheese.   All of this came out to just over $15 with two drinks.   So maybe they were having an off night, but I'm sad to say, the Pollo Fundido sucked. To call that mess atop the burro \"cream cheese\" is not only a lie, but an insult to real cream cheese because it had the consistency and taste of runny sour cream and no jalapeño taste whatsoever.   I was super bummed after rave reviews of this! The chicken was also extremely dried out, but the hot sauce managed to save it.   The Rod Burro; however, was delicious and I had total plate envy. Was it knock your socks off delicious? Definitely not. But Dude enjoyed it, which was great . . . Given how spoiled we are by his Nana's Sonoran Cooking.   Next time I want fast Mexican food and want to blow 700+ calories and over 35 grams of fat in a single sitting, I'm just going to Qdoba and getting a Chicken Burrito with that heavenly 3-cheese Queso and some habanero salsa. MMM MMM MMM!   Will I still come to Someburros? You betcha! Their combo plates and chimis are pretty good.   There's something for everyone here. Check it out for a fast, affordable meal, or if you're hosting a party!"}
{"text":"We came here when we were in Arizona. Absolutely delicious!!! We first tried them at Tempe Diablo stadium for an angels spring training game.  We then decided to go to the restaurant a couple of days later and it was a great atmosphere and delicious!"}
{"text":"Good customer service and quick! Long time customer at all locations. You gotta try the Beef Egg and Potato breakfast burrito with cheese it is good priced and filling and delicious. You also must try the bean and cheese burrito with whole beans and salad chicken . Also, try a folded cheese crisp with green chili it is soo good!"}
{"text":"I never have a problem finding something good to eat at Someburros.  Some of my favorite items to eat here are the tacos.  The shell is perfectly crispy, with juicy shredded chicken (or beef), and even better when you put the hot sauce/salsa on it.  Another favorite is the rod burro, which is a huge burrito filled with chorizo and beef enchilada style.  In addition to tasty eats, they have refreshing horchata to go with your meal."}
{"text":"When the food is good but Joseph R. Hates his job, or just had laryngitis and couldn't speak. Seriously a little creepy at how your lunch could leave a bad taste in your mouth after having horrible service."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very fast. Usually use the to go service which is always promt."}
{"text":"I've driven by here a few times and finally decided to stop and and try it out one night. I ended up getting a carne asada burrito, and it was better than I had expected it to be! The reason I went with 4 stars instead of 5 is simply because the staff at the counter kept fighting with each other. It wasn't anything bad, but just looked bad and it took me an extra several minutes to order.  The dining area was very clean, which is always nice for a restaurant! They also have tortilla chips and salsa that they bring to the table, and the salsa was great! I'll definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE customer service. We came in at 8:30 Sunday night and two teen servers argued about who was going to have to take our order. One sulky brunette refused , and the other girl reluctantly took our order, after letting us stand there a few minutes while she was messing around with the chips. At least five teenagers on staff there but it would be a stretch to say any of them were \"working\". Went to salt my avocado salad and someone loosened the top of the shaker so salt poured all over the salad. Bunch of brats!"}
{"text":"This is another place on my regular lunch rotation.  I have been eating at Someburros for years frequenting the locations in Tempe and Gilbert as well as this location by Chandler Mall  This is deli style.  You go to the counter and order, they give you a number, and then bring the food to your table.  The restaurant is always clean and well staffed.  The food at Someburros is on par with any good Mexican restaurant in the Valley, but it is fast and inexpensive.   Most adult meals with drink will cost about $8.  Kids cost 1/2 that.    I usually get one of the burritos.  Lately the Crudo Burro is my favorite.  It is shredded beef with SPICY tomatillo sauce.  Do not order this unless you can handle spicy food.  I also like the Rod Burro and the Poncho Villa.  I really like the rice, as well.    Someburros also has large party platters.  A number of times we have purchased party platters for a gathering at our house.  Our guests always devour the food and rave about it.  It is a relatively inexpensive way to cater a party.  Someburros is a great place for lunch and a relatively inexpensive way to feed the family.  If you have not tried it, definitely check it out."}
{"text":"The good: Tried SomeBurros for the first time...Really enjoyed the chicken burro.  The hot sauce is just right and the meal comes with chips, and rice and an all you can drink beverage bar. The place was clean and the service was pretty fast. We had our food within ten minutes. The bad: They charge for enchilada sauce. Minor issue."}
{"text":"Food is great but the wait was super long, I ordered ahead and still waited a half hour because the cooks didn't notice I ordered more food along with a fiesta platter.  The girl who was helping me apologized over and over again and then gave me a 15 gift card which was very nice of her!  So I was not in a big hurry but thank goodness I left the kids at home!"}
{"text":"Great food. One of the rare places for \"fast food\" that is served on real plstes. My all time favorite is the buracho burro. Good green chili meat and sauce. Great refrieds too."}
{"text":"The pollo fundido is excellent. This location seems a bit less clean than the San tan location. Maybe it's because it's so busy being close to the mall? Other than hat the food was good"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of someburros for years. Love love love the pollo fun dido, guac, rice, beans, mini chimis.... Basically whatever. I've been to several locations and they all consistently serve the same amazing food. The customer service is always great. They even give u free chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"The food was OK. Finding a scorpion burned on a chip, kind of made me loss my appetite"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and had hopes for this place, which is fairly close. All I can say is \"YUCK!\" Ordered a cheese enchilada and it was a cold unflavorful lump of cheese in a greasy, stale thick tasteless shell. Are you kidding me? Bland rice and beans. Others in our party ordered chicken tacos and found them to be about the same as my enchilada- substitute gross lump of dry flavorless chicken. The only happy person in our party was a ten year old who had ordered the fish tacos. He liked them, because, he said, they tasted like fortune cookies!"}
{"text":"Got a to go order and restaurant forgot the number one ingredient in my burrito. I got a veggie burrito and I was served avocado and tortilla. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Been eating here for years! Love it!! Tacos are amazing! Burros are fabulous! I am never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went to eat there at 445 and there was no booth that was clean to sit at.  There were 6 dirty ones though.  With  3 people behind the counter doing nothing,  it was irratating. On our way to Macayos to eat!"}
{"text":"Always amazing... never have anything bad to say. I pick up food from here once a week for my studio. All the employees are friendly. I only wish they would give chips with Togo orders and I didn't have to buy them all the time. :("}
{"text":"The atmosphere is clean and lots of sitting room. Good selection of Mexican food and seems to be a good step above fast food Mexican but not on same level as a few real Mexican favorites. Good cheese crisp. Mini chimis don't compete with gecko grill. Chimi was ok. Great chips and ok salsa. Ok price."}
{"text":"Favorite weekly restaurant for my family.   As a Arizona native I can say that this is great everyday Mexican food and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Better food in elementary school .  No flavor . And chicken doesn't look cooked . Worst Mexican I've ever had . Lol . How's t hard to mess up ?   But yea never ever ."}
{"text":"I've had better Mexican in the Valley, but Someburros' hot sauce keeps me coming back. The portions are decent but their add-ons are grossly overpriced. For example, cheese is $0.75, and sour cream is $0.95. Both of which should be standard fare for a burrito. Deep fried is delicious, but that's another buck. So by the time I pay, I feel nickeled and dimed to death; plus on takeout they do not give you chips or hot sauce which is standard for dine-in. I really enjoyed their $5 Fundido special on Wednesdays until they dropped it, because that was a great bargain. Their location is convenient to the house so we go fairly regularly, but I prefer Senor Taco in Mesa, which I can get during my lunch break."}
{"text":"The owners of Some Burros need to do a secret shop to see what is happening at their restaurant.  We were in the mood for good mexican food and decided to give them a try.  When we came in and ordered, we began to feel that we may have made the wrong choice.  The kid at the counter had no interest in being there.  I understand that a job as a cashier is not ideal, but try your best to make the most of it.  My wife ordered a beer to which the kid responded \"whatever\".  I assume that is because he could not take the order due to his age, but his attitude seemed to be the norm at what is loosely described as a restaurant.  The food was horrendous.  My wife's taco shells were old and the beef tasted off.  All of our food was luke warm at best, just like the two beers we ordered.  The kid that brought out our food was kind enough, but his kindness could not make up for the quality of the food.  We left a comment card with my phone number so I could chat with the manager about the experience to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I don't want things for free, I just want owners to know what is going on so they can make their business better.  I did not get a call which leads me to believe either the comment card was tossed or the message did just not get through.  Some Burros could be great, but they need to get back to basics."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the Food and the Service. I got Tacos, and asked if they were crunchy tacos was told yes and was brought soft street tacos. When I asked the girl just said sorry and walked away. The burrito we got was \"recommended\" by the staff however it was terrible. We ate maybe 2 bites. The one good thing was my son was happy with is Taquitos. We were really excited to try this place but for the price, the wait (really slow to take our order) and the quality of food we will never come back."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place dozens of times but never really been in the mood or checked it out. Our baseball team had a fundraiser and it was to support both our organization, the kids and the community. Besides, everyone loves some tacos chips and salsa.  To my surprise they had beer wine and frozen margaritas available and had I written this review when I first walked in they would've gotten 5 stars.   We ordered two kids plates (tacos, beans, rice, & drink) along with a Carne Asada Burrito and a Tostada Verde. Given that it was a funraiser night lots of people came out so I understood their being a little bit more of a wait.  The wait in the ordering line was probably the hardest only because theirs so many options and everyone likes their tacos burritos with and without certain things so it took a lot longer.  Food on the other hand came out pretty quick,  but don't expect to get blown away by a presentation unless you really love the blue green and yellow plates. Overall the food was good but living in Arizona we all know so many different Mexican spots so we have other options.  Would I  comeback... sure but not for a particular item... wait, the churro was bin!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent food, never had anything resembling service problems like some on here have stated"}
{"text":"Disgusting Mexican restaurant in Gilbert, I would take Filibertos over this place. Second time I ordered takeout at this restaurant, again my order was wrong. No flavor in the food.... use a lot of red sauce to give flavor. I'm a brunette and found blond hair in my food, made me sick!"}
{"text":"I must say I was terribly disappointed with my visit.  I grew up on tamales and was excited to try them here.  When I did. I found minimal meat, chewy cornmeal and overall lack of taste.  The olive placed inside too up a larger area (if looking from the side) than the meat did.  Chips and salsa were good.  But that alone can't cause me to like this place."}
{"text":"First time I have come here in years. I don't remember how my last experience went so I'm rating based on today's. Clean and convenient location with outside seating. Misters were on for those who preferred to sit outside in the heat. Line to order moved quickly. Cashier was friendly and efficient. They provide free chips with their excellent red salsa. I ordered their carne asada fries. So much better than Los Favorito's and Filiberto's. The fries were thick, fresh, and tasted like they were cut in house. Their beans, carne asada and guac are also better than the two businesses mentioned previously. They have real silverware and bring your food out to you. Great place. Will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good for fast food. A go to place for us when we need to eat in a hurry. The only thing they could improve on is cosistancy. Sometimes the food comes out vey hot (which I love). Sometimes it comes out lukewarm."}
{"text":"Food is ok, I have tried several different dishes and none disappointed. I wish they had better salsas, liquid with no substance. Not the best but not the worse Mexican food."}
{"text":"You ever eat at a place and it's either so good or so bad you feel compelled to leave your review even before you leave the establishment? This is one of those. I'm still sitting here trying to shovel this slip down my gullet.  This is shit food. Especially if it's meant to remember anything close to real Mexican or New Mexican food. It's just shit.  Ordered a Carne Asada burrito with no rice. I got what seems to be a bean burrito with a Tony bit of meat.  Ordered a side of salsa. Got charged $2.50. They also won't show your your total or give you a reciept until after they bring their food out.  Not good. Pass on this place. It's fast food Mexican and Taco Bell is much better if crappy food is what you're lookin for.  Oh and the guy workin the counter took my money and then with the same hand grabbed a chips tray and scooped it up using the same hand. Super unsanitary. Just added to the grossness of the food.  If you want solid Mexican in this area the following are all solid: Senor Taco, Mi Casita, Elmers"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. They remodeled the inside of the restaurant but the food still taste great. Usually come here as I wait for discount tires to get done working on my car next door"}
{"text":"Great fast food Mexican food. I had the number one combination plate which was a crispy taco cheese enchilada rice and beans. The taco is nice and crispy and very flavorful. The cheese enchilada was great, especially when I combined it with my chips. Love love love the hot sauce which is served in a bottle so you can squirt it directly on your food."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mexican food!  Stopping in yesterday for a quick bite was a pleasantly surprising experience, especially after reading some less than flattering reviews.This is a great place to swing by for lunch if you are a vegetarian - sorry, I cannot speak for the carnivores. The beans and rice are wonderful, especially when topped with their guacamole, pico de avocado and other salsas. Not having had other menu items I cannot comment further.  A clean restaurant that serves great food with fast, friendly service. What's not to love? I will definitely dine here next time I find myself in this area of town."}
{"text":"Came in...ordered food....got served...ate. It was that simple. I got the chicken fundido being that I'm on the slightly hungover side. It really satisfied my cravings of Mexican food. I enjoy the simplicity of a burrito stuffed with chicken and smothered in fundido. The rice is delicious. One suggestion: if you and your partner are debating on getting a side of rice or beans, know that \"sides\" can easily fill 2 people"}
{"text":"First off, this place is busy every time we come for dinner, so they must be doing something right. The Pollo Fundido is the reason you come to Some Burros. So good. Probably not good for you due to deep frying the whole thing, but it is delicious.  I can't vouch for how fresh the food is--our meal came out as soon as we sat down, which is nice, but they must have some of the food prepared ahead of time.  Not entirely sure of their operation in the kitchen, they may cook everything fresh, but just something I noticed on this visit. And the salsa is nothing to brag about--bland and tasteless.  My wife and I usually split the Fundido and they actually split the meal for us unlike other places where they just give out an extra plate.  Not the most authentic Mexican food I've had--overall, it's just okay."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for a fast food joint. I like that they have some vegetarian options. I like their salsa and I like the flavor of the red enchilada sauce. This place is usually pretty clean. The only downside is if you come when its busy there is never any free tables which can be a problem for my family of 5."}
{"text":"Not that great but just ok. The spiccy beef burro was good....thought the beef taste different from other beef o eat....maybe it is donkey meat. Not a bad environment and friendly staff.  Them my tummy hurt bad after ten minutes of eating....maybe it was food i aye earlier or maybe not. So if it taste funny...then throw it away."}
{"text":"It cant compare with restuarants like El Zocalo, Los Dos Molinos, or Espos but for fast food its hands down my favorite in the area. Their shredded beef tacos are really good."}
{"text":"As i am a glutton for punishment, I gave it yet another shot.  I'm pleased to say it went well.  Ordered online, food was ready at drive and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"This place is convenient and that's really it. The only thing that is somewhat decent is the chips and guacamole. I feel like their meat has a strange flavor to it so it's hard for me to enjoy any dish here. I would not recommend this place as there's soooo many other options in the area that are a million times better.   The only positive thing I can say about this place is:  The chips are edible  The service isn't horrible The prices aren't horrible   For the same pricing I would much rather go to Los Taquitos, Espos, or even Cafe Rio"}
{"text":"My go-to mexican food. Taco Tuesdays are a steal. Also, their pollo fundido is delicious."}
{"text":"So I work right down the street from this place and I eat lunch here at least once a week.  The set up of this place is somewhat unique. When you walk in, you walk up to the counter to order your food. If you order a combo meal they give you tortilla chips and this really good hot salsa. When your food is ready they bring it out to you.   I always get the same thing here: veggie burro without cheese or tomatoes, add extra cilantro. The burro is a pretty decent size and it's full of delicious pinto beans, cilantro, avocado, and onions. I can get that and a small drink for $7, which is not bad.   The staff is usually very friendly and welcoming and the place is kept pretty clean.  It is good for small-medium sized groups as there is ample seating and booths. They also have plenty of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience tonight.  Received my Pollo  Fundido smothered in onions- which I am allergic to.  Went up to manager Bianca and told her I could not eat.  She told me menu said there are onions.  Did not offer to remake, scrape off , refund- nothing.  I walked away thinking she would cone to my table to offer to make the situation right-nope.  Guy came to the table to bring us part of our food which was yo go.  I asked him if I was getting a refund, he laughed and said he would take care of it.  Ten minutes passed.  Went up and spoke with Bianca and told her I needed a redone.  She said there was nothing wrong with good do she would not be refunding.  I have worked in many restaurants and if a customer is not satisfied you do whatever it takes to make them happy.  She was extremely rude and unprofessional.  She FINALLY said I could speak with a different manager who promptly refunded me.  Bianca needs to go thru  retraining and learn how to treat customers so they want to return."}
{"text":"Usually love this place. But tonight I tried ordering to go and the guy Daniel kept fighting me on the menu and that I was ordering wrong. I have been ordering the same thing since it first opened. I know what it is and what it comes with. He was arguing  with me. So of course I hung up. I called again 10 min later to try again and maybe get someone else and he was still fighting me on it. I hung up because at this point I am furious. I am calling tonight to talk to a manager because customer service is #1 to me and he made it horrible. I love this place but his fighting me is making me not want to go there for awhile."}
{"text":"Yum burros!! I came back because I remembered how much I like their pollo fundido and I wasn't disappointed.  The restaurant was clean, the staff friendly.  I took away one star because the chips were a little soggy; too long in the fryer. But otherwise I'm glad I got to share this place with my parents."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I moved away to California and often crave this place. My last trip to Arizona, I had my mom bring me some because I was staying in Maricopa.  I just Re heated it!"}
{"text":"The Barracho Burro is amazing!  Also, if you love Pollo Fundido then you absolutely must try theirs.    They give unlimited chips and their own unique salsa.  It's not really greasy and \"unhealthy feeling\" the way some fast-food mexican food can be.  You get large portions with high quality ingredients that taste amazing.    I moved out of state but if I come back I'm here for nearly 2 meals a day, no joke."}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price. My little boy loves their bean burros. Eats them hot or cold and easy to call in a take out order. Never had any issues getting my order wrong."}
{"text":"This is such a random place... It appears to be a sit down restaurant, but once you walk in- you realize it's really NOT!   The shredded chicken in the burros & the mini-chimis were awful. We literally spent $23 and threw it all away.   I hate to write bad reviews- I really do, but I had to do it for this place!"}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. We always like Someburros.   Sure, it isn't very authentic. It is typical \"Americanized\" Mexican food, but it is tasty, the restaurant is very clean and the staff is always polite and helpful."}
{"text":"love this place. super clean, great service and good food!"}
{"text":"Ordered two different chimis.  Red beef and machca.  The red beef was ok.  Although be ready to taste it again in a few hours.  The machca beef was more shredded beef (not a bad thing) than machca.  On the menu both come enchilada style which, quite frankly, is something I don't get.  So we passed on that.  Otherwise it was served with melted cheese ( kind of a weird texture/constancy), sour cream and guacamole.  Sour cream was sour cream.  Guacamole was ok, although the avocados could have been mashed a little more.  Chips were good but I found the salsa to be a little hotter than I prefer.  Overall not bad."}
{"text":"You know, I actually like Some Burros.  The restaurant is always clean.  They use no lard in their food, so that is a plus.  Their hot sauce is tasty.  You are not charged for chips.  They have counter service with a smile... All the food runners are pleasant and helpful.  The prices are low.  The food tastes fresh.  Their tortillas are actually yummy and you can order a pack of tortillas to go.  Is this fine dining?  No way.  It is a step up from Qdoba and several steps up from Filiberto's.   Four stars because for this type of food, it is one of my favorites.  Is it Gallo Blanco?  Of course not.  It is not meant to be.  It is quick service, with a family atmosphere.  I come here about once a month and I will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"I just thought I would warn everyone that when you eat at SomeBurros from time to time you bite into a sharp piece of metal in your food. I suggest going somewhere that takes a little more pride in not having sharp metal objects in their food."}
{"text":"Food was fast, but initial service was terrible. We came in, no line at all, and waited several minutes while the staff laughed and told jokes with each other, backs turned to the counter. Then, when the cashier turned around, he took several more minutes to get a tray ready before even saying anything to us. We were right there, and they were all to busy chatting. Then, as he is finally taking our order, a tall, stylish woman walks in, and the other cashier just leaps at the chance to take her order. Unacceptable behavior, all around."}
