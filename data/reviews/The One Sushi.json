{"text":"I'm not one to post reviews but this place deserved some special attention. Definitely not \"The One\" for me or for anyone in fact. Never have I been to a restaurant. Especially an all you can eat. Order one round to taste the menu and just pay and leave. Absolute terrible service, asked to speak to a manager and was informed there is no manager. The food was horrendous. We ended up going across the street at another restaurant to eat. Be warned. I really hope no one goes through the same experience as I just did."}
{"text":"this place is an all you can eat sushi restaurant. You use iPad to order and everything is served to you  This place is not worth it to be honest. The sushi was okay but the wrapper was so hard to chew. The other items were so boring and you got tired of it. The fried race was SO OILY that it stuck onto my sisters face. The dynamite roll was honestly the highlight of the food. Also the tiramisu was tiny but pretty good.  The reason this gets 1 stars is because the service is terrible. They gave me water 1 the whole time I was there. They were a bit slow in confirming the orders. I AM SO PEEVED because the orders come out INCREDIBLY SLOW. I literally ordered one the hand roll when we first got there and it came out 50 minutes later. This happened more than once.  The washroom was very nice but had no tissue. Restaurant itself is dirty. I will come back because I love sushi that is in big amounts. But I hope I find another place because this is very terrible"}
{"text":"Sushi feasts!! Nice staff!! Fast service!! I'll come back for sure if i'm really hungry!! I like the idea of ordering food from ipads!! It's cool!!"}
{"text":"The space is huge and I like the concept of ordering from the ipad, instead of checking off a piece of paper which is usually the case at most all you can eat places.  The sashimi isnt bad and the rest of the menu is pretty mediocore. I did not enjoy the sushi rolls at all. There was 2 of us and we ordered a sake as well..the bill came to about $75. For the amount of food we actually ate, it was an expensive bill which could have been cheaper at a regular sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for their lunch AYCE. Out of the 4 AYCE places we've been to, this is definitely the worst. We tried a little bit of everything and while their sushi were just borderline acceptable, their dim sum and Korean ribs were horrendous. The dim sum were dry, small, and the colour was a bit off. You can go buy the frozen stuff at any Asian supermarket and it will be a lot better. As for the Korean ribs, they were paper thin and super tough. The only way I could take a bite was if I held it with my hand and pulled hard.  If you love cucumber, their sushi will be right up your alley. Literally every roll and cone comes with shredded cucumber as an ingredient, you can't avoid it. Their tempura were fresh though, which was nice. We were the first and only customers in the restaurant for about 15 minutes but we ended up getting one of our rolls an hour after we had ordered it so service is a bit lacking.  The only thing I can actually rave about is their green tea ice cream. It's creamy and so rich in flavour, unlike some of the other varieties I've had.  Considering the price you pay is not consistent with the value and quality, I can safely say I'll never be returning again."}
{"text":"Me & my wife have been going here since day 1.  The quality of the food is great, the portions were good but starting to get smaller.  The place has great atmosphere, & friendly staff, plus they can handle large groups easily. Ordering is done by an IPad so you don't have to wait for your server.  We have noticed lately that the orders have come incomplete & not the correct amount some of the time which can be frustrating. The new thing they have is all you can eat crab for a few dollars more which is awesome. Not really sure on how long this will be available.  Definitely give them a try, still probably one of the best in the city."}
{"text":"Currently sitting here waiting to be served. Over 30 mins. I arrived at 4:30 pm from Chinook Mall. They have 6 servers on the floor and all are crowding the silverware like scavengers.  No one has come to take our order even though the iPad Menu is a nice gimmick.  If nothing changes I will go across the street to McLeod Sushi. ------------------------------------------------ It is now 5:30 and im going to McLeod Sushi.  Service here blows and the sushi is subpar even though others have said how good it is."}
{"text":"I just got home from dinner at The One with a friend. It was so much better than my last visit. Thursday night here is so much better than a weekend. We arrived, were seated within 30 seconds of walking in the door. Our drink order was taken immediately. We were seated 3 tables away from the closest occupied table. Everything came out in a nice spaced-out manner. Half way through our meal someone who was not our server (a manager maybe?) came by the table to see how everything was. She also asked if we wanted to try the ginger chicken or ginger beef - which were new and not on the iPad ordering system yet. We tried the ginger chicken. It was alright - not as good as Silver Dragon - but that's understandable. The chicken was moist and they were nice sized pieces.  The sushi seemed to be a bit smaller than my last visit (specifically the rice balls) which was a good thing because we didn't feel like we ordered too much when we left - which is usually the case with me at all you can eat sushi places."}
{"text":"One of the satisfying places that you can go to in Mcleod just changed, sadly not for the best. Key menu items just vanished from the order list and it's unfortunate. Salmon/beef teriyaki to name a few. The salmon sushi and the other rolls just got a taste of cost cutting. Shrimp tempura are so small (like baby shrimps). So if you are planning to go here, think again. The value for your money just got cut...... Big time."}
{"text":"Service need improve and careful  because we still waiting for service order our foods iPad. When we have birthday party and really mix up because service always put wrong order give to mix up peoples what they want order foods.  Staff need more learn how to speak English and read because we are canada and English speak.  I hope your company need improve, next time careful communication what they want order foods, on time and need English language."}
{"text":"Interesting concept with i pad but is very pricey and Sushi was not up to standard usually I just want more but here I found its texture was dissapointing and not exciting at all didn't even get seconds (and this is all you can eat) didn't find the service too bad but due to the quality of their rolls I will not go back..save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"When we want a combination of sushi and korean food, we come to this place.  Although not the best sushi out there, it is acceptable.  I would call it value packed if you're not picky.  The Macleod Trail location has better service compared to the location in Pacific Place Mall, in the N.E.   This N.E. location advertises 20% off the cost of the AYCE, but beware.  When you go to pay, they want cash.  This requirement is not stipulated anywhere on their ad.  We seldom carry cash, so this leaves one feeling very awkward."}
{"text":"I went last night with a friend, it was our first time - we were hopeful... It ended there.  We didn't get our drinks until about half an hour after ordering them, most of the food was cold and dry. It was honestly very unappetizing. The worst part was that the fruit rolls we ordered had a hair in them and were served on a dirty plate! It was disgusting. The chicken wasn't cooked properly and the noodles were soggy. For all the problems we faced it wasn't worth the $30 we paid.   Go here if you want a bad stomach ache the next day! We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been to The One Sushi for quite sometime but checking in always slips my mind. My review is nothing new because you can either experience it first hand yourself or read what everyone else have said. What I do recommend is if you're going for AYCE, plan ahead! Why? It does get busy during peak hours and waiting for your order will take some time.  Note: Expectation vs Reality - whatever you see on the iPad (plating, portion size, etc.) is NOT even close to what you get as a dish. View reference picture enclosed.  Recommend choice(s): - beef tataki  - fried hot bun - mango pudding - fried milk - boat - upgrading to crab AYCE  Pros: - competitive AYCE price - great selection in Japanese, Korean, Thai, and Chinese dishes - ordering via iPad (vs some places where it's pencil + paper) - once you know the server's passcode no need to wait   Cons: - can get busy during peak times - long wait time during busy hours - boats are not included in AYCE, must be ordered - when upgrading to crab, EVERYONE must automatically upgrade to crab not just a single person - expectation vs reality (iPad picture looks nothing like dish in real life) - waiting for a server to punch his/her passcode could take a while  Overall, a +1 in my books. I would recommend The One and of course will check in again the next time I visit."}
{"text":"The One Sushi opened up their second location which is in Pacific Place Mall right beside Fit4Less and T&T Supermarket.   With The One operating the same as their MacLeod location they still offer AYCE sushi, Japanese food, Chinese, Thai, and Korean food. The only difference is their location, atmosphere and the inside look of their restaurant. The One offers take out and delivery using SkipTheDish, for their grand opening week (April 25-May 2) they offered a 10% discount off your bill if you paid in cash or 5% off if you paid via credit. At the moment they don't take interact but they are working on getting that issue resolve.   If you NEVER been to The One then you surely are missing out! With their lunch buffet starting at $16.95 ($17.95 on weekends) and their dinner buffet at $27.95 you can't go wrong. From AYCE sushi to having kbbq to ordering simple Chinese food, there's endless possibilities to choose from let alone endless \"rounds\" of how many times you can order.  Ordering is plain and simple using their iPad system, depending on how busy they get you can either get your food right away or just have to be patient for a couple of minutes. Peak times for lunch are at 12-2 and for dinner between 6-8.   A +1 for recommendation and a repeat customer in my books, as for food wise? Try out everything, there's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed not quite sure what happened to this restaurant. I have been a few times since it opened and it was always good but not recently. We went for my birthday and the restaurant was so dirty, floors were filthy, tables sticky. They have added a buffet and removed many items from the menu. The buffet area was in disarray and had many items missing or empty. The service was very  slow and the meal not very good. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Yet another night I didn't want to cook so We stopped by for what turned out to be an All You Can Eat for $27 dollar night. If there was another menu, we weren't made aware of it.  Our server gave us an iPad and from it you type in your choices. You get a confirmation when your order has been received. Magically, food starts arriving a few minutes later.  There are numerous items available. Mostly sushi and whatnot but a bit of Korean, Thai as well as Chinese in the mix.  Some  items were better quality than others, but I don't think you can expect much more than that from all you can eat. The place was packed and a bit hectic, in part due to the size, so don't think you'll have an intimate dinner at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd say that in terms of food served that this is a throughly average sushi place. Not excellent, not terrible. The iPad menu is cool, but as people have noted before, while the first round of food comes pretty quickly, the second or God forbid third rounds are obnoxiously slow. The servers were nice enough, and I would totally recommend the salmon belly & tempura shrimp. I would go back, but it's no where near the top of my list for Calgary restaurants."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have all you can for a very affordable price. The sushi is yummy, the only thing I would suggest is to add sashimi to the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Bad service!The food was very slow to served ! We just waited for almost an hour.waist of time.i will not eat agin here"}
{"text":"Love the place! Buffet for 17.95 not bad for the service you get. Really awesome food."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I went here it was not bad our server was good a few things that made me give this place 3 star was It could be a lot cleaner like big time plus I used the bathroom an while I was in there the guy mopping the floor Come with in one inch of my feet with the mop"}
{"text":"Well, what started out quite good has deteriorated to mediocre..The sushi is ok, but nothing special. The sushi is much like the hot dishes with very little variance in the flavor from item to item. The last time we were their, we were charged over $90 for 2 adults and a 3 year old. This was the first time we were charged for our daughter. I complained about this, and they lowered the charge to $14.95 for our child. Our daughter had 2 pcs of sushi rice and a tempura shrimp. Too pricey for us, we will start going to GlobeFish from now on. We can get quite a filling for all 3 of us fur under $60. Plus the sushi at GlobeFish is remarkably better. I take back what I said in the last review."}
{"text":"This has become my favourite place for all you can eat sushi in town. Great selection and variety, although admittedly I've had the odd experience where the sushi wasn't great. Overall, however, the food has been delicious. The ipad ordering system is a great innovation for a place like this, and ensures that you get your food whenever you like, instead of being dependant on the servers. This seems to free up a lot of time for the servers, as the food and drinks always comes out swiftly. All the employees are exceptionally friendly.   As I said before, the only complaint I have is that the sushi is not always top-tier and coming in can be a bit hit or miss. For the price, though, this place is worth checking out if you need to put yourself in a sushi coma."}
{"text":"We tried One Sushi for the first time at lunch... Advertised as all you can eat buffet but they also offer lunch specials.  We were told that the whole table would either have to have the buffet or we all had the special.  Originally we went for the buffet, but the selection was so limited  that we decided to go for the specials, and we would mix and match between the three of us.  Well, the bento boxes arrived and 2 put of the 6 boxes were empty, not great presentation.  The teriyaki chicken and beef were cold and the dumplings were luke warm and tough.  We were seated for almost an hour before a refill of water was offered. Not impressed, we will mot be back and we will not recommend."}
{"text":"My sister told me about this place. It was well worth going to. The food is super. I wonder if the owner is a Jet Lee fan, as I remember the movie called \"The One\" with Jet Lee.   Anyway, the servers are very nice and the food comes quick. All the dishes I had were tasty. It is not too crowded here. The tables have lots of space between them. I am coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I'm always wary of AYCE sushi, but was very pleasantly surprised by the quality at One Sushi. The Sashimi was especially fresh and tender. Portions were small - a good thing with AYCE - so I didn't feel overly stuffed with sushi rice. The fish slices on the nigiri were pretty small and thin, so order a combination of sushi and sashimi. ONE offers a good selection of sushi staples and interesting maki without being overwhelming. The AYCE crab leg add on was definitely worth the extra $3. Restaurant was clean and service was very fast and polite. Whatever quality issues ONE may have had in the past, they've obviously worked hard to overcome them."}
{"text":"This place was horrible.... we first ordered some calamari thinking it would be enough appetizer, they brought out a huge white plate with only 2 pieces of calamari. Secondly, we ordered the sweet potato roll, the women then brought us rolls that was actually mango, I told her that we ordered the sweet potato roll instead and she told me that the kitchen ran out of sweet potato so they replaced it with mango... they didn't even bother to come out and tell us they just went ahead and assumed we were okay with it.. That was unacceptable and very unprofessional with what they did. Never coming back"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch buffet, and it was amazing! The food is fresh, thanks to their new ipad menu. It doesn't get made until you order it, and then you have to wait a bit while they make your food. It's definitely worth it though, because the rolls are fresh, warm, and crunchy where it is suppose to be. Side dishes are fabulous as well. Did not expect this good of a sushi buffet in Calgary."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Me and my hubby are addicted to all you can eat sushi. this is one of the best i have ever been!  price is 29$. worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"I rarely choose an eating establishment based on \"value\", but I do set my expectations accordingly based on price. I have not ventured into an all you can eat sushi restaurant since attending University in Dallas, Texas where students could eat with a student ID for $9.99 at Sumo Sushi on Sunday nights.  Being in a different country this go-round, and driving by I thought I'd give \"The One\" a shot. Despite the bad publicity, I had ventured into Home Food Inn a few times and the layout looks similar but refreshed. For $28, you can eat not only sushi, but a variety of other pseudo Japanese foods. While I doubt patrons of Ki or Japanese Nationals would be impressed, the sushi is above average and the off sushi Japanese fare is bland and not true to its heritage.   The food has great presentation which masks average quality fish. The iPad ordering system is gimmicky but kind of cool at the same time. The staff was on their toe's to ensure your water and drinks were filled at all times. All in all, I'd return to \"The One\" for lunch as I think its more lunch fare quality than dinner.   If your hungry and came back from a running a marathon, have a growing teen, or just completed a 100k bike ride and need to carb/protein load, this is the establishment for you! Otherwise, I would wait and try \"The One\" for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in today like we have many times before. Took a chance with no reservation and to our surprise it really was not all that busy, it was around 2pm so most of the lunch crowd had cleared out it seemed. While waiting for a table to be cleared we noticed the Christmas tree was still up at the door where you wait to be seated. We chuckled a bit. After being seated we were given some drinks and that was it for a while....we then noticed the light above the table was going on and off and dimming, also at that time we realized we had not been here since New Years and that the Christmas decorations were still up including the lights and a big Rudolph on the wall. This place has gone downhill as far as you can go. It was not busy yet the food took a long time to show up and the quality was not there at all like it used to be. Even the menu has been pretty much cut in half. We had to ask our server that ignored us for a drink refill (many many times)who then placed the cups in an order she could remember to take them away and refill them I think the 2 that still had ice went to the right people.... The whole time we were there the tables beside us were the bus areas I guess. Nobody cleared anything at our table so we took the liberty of just piling our dirty dishes with the rest beside us. Most of the time a server was standing doing nothing within a few feet never bothering with anything at all. The people on the other side of us we so irate they actuall called a server and asked to see a list of what had not been givin to them, at that time instead of using the iPad the gave a verbal order asking for a hot dish and one of evry ice cream....after 10 minutes it all showed up never ate any of it, and then they got up and left(without paying). Our girls had to use the restroom, after they left the table the oldest came back disgusted and one of the others said they would rather risk a bladder infection and hold it rather than use the restroom. After being fed up we just decided to pay(for what we got I guess) and leave. This place used to be really good as far as all you can eat sushi places go, but now someone dying of starvation after crossing barren lands for 40 days and nights would pass on this place. Where you went to pay was worse than where we sat that you had to walk around carts and piles of dishes on the floor around the whole area. The other patrons waitng to pay behind us all had the same experience and complaints.... The service is horrible and the people are rude. The place is filthy and unkept. The food is not really that good at all(anymore). It is way over priced. We will never return and will warn all friends family and co-workers."}
{"text":"Average food, order via iPad which was difficult to navigate and our orders came out wrong, some dishes are below par and others not so bad ... Sushi Bar B Q Inn across the street is much better and better value"}
{"text":"Worst sushi restaurant i have ever eaten at. Terrible customer service, altogether we waited about 2 hours for our food. The fish smelt old and horrible. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I came here with my family for dinner tonight (we had come once before for lunch and it was decent). The food meh. My seaweed salad came out partially frozen, the sashimi was so thin you could see through it. But the BBQ ribs were yummy. If it was based on the food quality alone I would give it at least 2-3 stars. The zero star is for the service and ambience. They were understaffed, it was barely busy for a Saturday night and all the servers were scrambling to clear and wash tables. We requested a booth at the back of the restaurant because I have a young baby and wanted to nurse her but we were told a big group of 20 people were coming to sit back there so we couldn't. They never came. The servers we interacted with were either curt and short or unprofessional. Our server was having a fight and complaining to a coworker about his sore feet and how he had to work so much and swearing at her and mocking are about how she should just go home. Swearing. F*bomb and sh*t, multiple times. There is no music so you can hear every conversation of the tables around you, our soups came with disposable plastic spoons (they said they ran out of spoons?!!), the bathrooms were unbelievablely filthy. It was awful. For a 27.95$ per person dinner it was terrible. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant I have ever been to, very clean, fast and friendly service and the food is so delicious. Plus you can order a lot for a great price, I love the way you can order your food on the iPad and it has pictures, prices and tells you what's in it all in one spot!  I will definitely go here again and again!"}
{"text":"Service: 4/5 Food: 3/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Price: 5/5  For the price. You are getting a lot for this place. The staff here is friendly and did everything quickly and swiftly. Parking is shared between other stores but there is lots of parking.  The fish and sushi is not as fresh but that is expected. It wasn't that bad though. Also the friend food wasn't that bad as well.  Only problem is this place does need a revamp cause it does not look as nice as a restaurant should be."}
{"text":"We have never seen such a spectacular combination of terrible food, rude service and restaurant uncleanliness. After you put in your order through the iPad, it is based on shear luck if you get what you ordered. They bring it out so slow and even the waitresses don't know what you're missing. So many items were forgotten and we had to walk up to the counter to ask them about sashimi twice before we received them.   We had received our food in 15 minute increments to which none of the cooked food was hot. I would recommend cutting a slab of raw grocery store salmon on your washroom floor, over going to this place. You would get better service and food quality.  Our table was never cleaned and we had to stack our own dirty dishes. Only for the dish cart to be left right beside our table, and we had to clear our own table. My girlfriend and I also got food poisoning from the suspicious salmon and beef tataki.  Unless you're currently dieing of starvation or like to torture yourself for fun, I would avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"Nope.  Never again.  Went for lunch today. Restaurant was super quiet so no waiting for a seat.  Upon walking in I noticed an overwhelming stench of rotten fish. This kind of made me not want to eat there but having not been there for a while we decided why not.    Ordered the standard rolls, and some other things and wound up not getting half of what we ordered. Sorry. Not gonna cut it. And the server touched almost all of our food when she brought a new dish to the table. Wasn't a good experience."}
{"text":"It's not without its charms; took me lovely fiance their for some sushi since sushi is her religion. She specified that I find somewhere we haven't tried, all you can eat and that is affordable. The One Sushi fit all the criteria. The restaurant is big and lots of available seating (wish their fish pond was filled though). Sat down and was given an IPad with their entire menu and we could order any time, with orders sent directly to the kitchen; very cool. The sashimi was, well, not the freshest and a lot of the rolls weren't really all tha t professional looking but tasted really good to me. My lady was not super into the place but she did enjoy grossing me out when she ordered the squid and slurped it up slowly and disgustingly (God I love that woman ). It was ok; cheap and very convenient but certainly not in the top 20 that this city has to offer. Definitely a 3.5 star place.  Side note: do not order the curry soup. It be baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!"}
{"text":"Ive heard the bad rep that the chinese restaurant got before, and was having some serious anxiety when my girlfriend said to try this new sushi place.   We drove by it everyday for years and was quite curious when we saw the teansformation to what it is today.  Today was the grand opening (3 days old) and we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was finely renovated and decorated.  The uuber modern use of ipads for your all you can eat menu as well as beckoning a server is simple and well thought out.  The food was actually very good.  With not just japanese sushi on the menu, but also chinese and korean items as well.  The servings are small but by design.  If you're here for all you can eat why overdo it with one bug portion.  Dude, you're here for variety!    Deep fried milk.... it is a must try.  Sorry Calgary Stampede, this is one dessert that they got you beat on.  Very spacious,  we are definitely coming back for repeat visits!"}
{"text":"This sushi place is all you can eat. We have seen a huge decline in the quality and service of this sushi place. The portions are getting smaller and smaller plus you place your order on a iPad and most of the time the order is never completed with several things that were ordered never show up at the table. If they do show up they were cold. What really has been the icing on the cake not to return is the cleanliness of the restrooms, in general, the entire experience has declined. My 2 boys ate there a few months ago and they both had food poisoning."}
{"text":"WORST sushi ever!! This place is really dirty!!! The sashimi was not fresh at all and the sushi looked very dry and small , laughable quality!!! Will never eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe , it was my mistake to go this place on Christmas evening.  Their food was terrible. Sushi smells bad .. like they're going to go bad soon, waiters and waitress didn't answer at all. They just run. Tea cups and tables were dirty but I couldn't even ask to any one to replace or clean it.   I am still waiting for my bill for 20 minutes. I won't come back ."}
{"text":"You'd think that if someone wanted to reopen a new restaurant inside the former location of a buffet that was known citywide for having had the biggest health code violation fine of all time... one would... you know, spruce the place up a little. And by spruce I mean sandblast the kitchen and dining area. Or maybe burn down the old building and salt the earth.  Let's start with the parking lot. How much does it cost to blacktop a parking lot? I parked in a dirt lot that made me feel like I was heading to an outdoor music festival on a hill top. That's not a compliment.  A sign in the window lets you know that their menu is set up on an iPad. Maybe that's what they spent their reno money on, because the rest of the restaurant looks like they just reversed the signage of the old restaurant. The interior is the same. Same blinds. You can even still see Home Food Inn signs in the patio leading up to the entrance. The floor leading toward the table where my party was seated, was sticky. My table was off-kilter and was a recipe for spilled food.  The two stars really is for the service. The waitresses were friendly, efficient, and knew the menu well - which is good, because the fancy ~iPad menu~ (which was as sticky as the floor) only had photos and names, but with no descriptions. They worked in teams and communicated well with each other; we never had interruptions in service and the AYCE orders came out in a steady stream.  The food? Meh. I mean, I guess you can't expect too much from AYCE sushi, and if you're hungry and in a time crunch, it comes out super quick. It wasn't terrible. Just ordinary. I'm glad they offer gluten free soy sauce, though.   The bathroom was also sticky. So no, I probably wouldn't come back. I don't want to do things that make me sticky."}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews, but after giving this place 3 tries I felt it was time. Walking in, you won't be greeted for at least 2-3 minutes and eventually a server will begrudgingly walk up and show you to your seat. The times I've went, the place has been pretty empty so I can't even attribute their slowness and lack of respect to being too busy. Every time I've went, they have forgot something we ordered but have always charged us for it anyways, even after flagging a server down and asking them about it. The most recent time we went, we sat at our table with empty dishes for about 20 minutes waiting for a server to come to our table but if never happened. We were planning to order a dessert but since no one attended to us we proceeded to wait up front to get our bill, which took at least 5 minutes for someone to finally ring us out. It wasn't just us either, every table around us received the same cold, non existent service. I always leave feeling like an inconvenience. There is way better sushi places in the city than this place, I won't be back and I'm sure to tell everyone how terrible the service is!"}
{"text":"Great new sushi spot on central macleod trail.   Neat ipad ordering system makes all you can eat eating a breeze.   Things to note:  Been here twice later in the evening,  both times last call was an hour earlier than we expected as the website had the wrong hours of operation. It's been several weeks and they haven't fixed the website.   So call before you come,  if you're coming late.   Second.   On the menu,  item photos have two of things,  but say one piece. There is only one piece.   Third.   Sashimi  pieces are VERY small,  the sushi pieces are small. Bite size you might say,  so don't be afraid to order.   This place is great.  Lots of Japanese,  Chinese,  Thai,  Vietnamese options. The service is also top notch.   The beef and onion rolls are deadly.   Check out One. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chaos. Our orders took way too long or did not arrive at all.  They must find a better system so that all orders are attended to in a decent amount of time.  The food is good, when you get them and the ambience is good, just don't expect much on the weekends."}
{"text":"We've been here countless times. After tonight, this will be our last. When we arrived there was a family (with at least 4 children) running around and being horribly distracting. The youngest kids were crying with no adults bothering to try and quiet them. This family obviously belonged to one of the servers as when she brought over a portion of our order a little girl was chasing her asking to be lifted up. The family eventually left but the experience did not get any better.  Considering it was prime time for dinner on a Saturday, there were only a handful of tables in use. The service was ridiculously slow. Half our food was barely warm, many of the items are COATED in Cajun spice, and the teriyaki beef is coated in Montreal steak spice with teriyaki drizzled on top. All of my tempura was hot but completely soggy and disgusting. The table next to use refused theirs and I followed suit.  My husband made a comment that since the place across the street closed down the quality here has dropped because there is no more competition.  The staff are friendly, but it is not enough to make up for the terrible experience we had tonight. If I was able to give 0 stars, I would."}
{"text":"I was in here last weekend for the  \" all you can eat experience\" Being vegetarian - I hoped that there would be enough for me to choose from - and there was!  That said there were some definite highs and lows to the whole experience.   The good IPAD ORDERING   I loved the ordering from the IPAD experience -it was very cool - you were given an IPAD with the full menu and simply ordered what you wanted  - and magically the food would arrive.   FAST SERVICE The food came out quite quickly, and the servers were all very friendly. VALUE The price for all you can eat for lunch was $16.99 , and we ate alot of stuff - we started with Miso Soup - I ordered a salad, Spicy Tofu - Stir Fried Vegetables, Avocado Rolls, Spring Rolls, Cheese Stuffed Wontons, Sesame Balls,  - my honey ordered a ton more stuff too - there was SO MUCH FOOD - and everything was very good.  The not so good   RESTAURANT CLEANLINESS We sat in a booth by the window, and although the table and seats were clean - the window ledges were absolutely filthy - with tons of dust and debris? What was that? It would have only taken a couple of minutes with a cloth and soapy water to wipe that down - it was definitely gross. RESTAURANT DECOR The decor was very basic - black was the predominant color inside everywhere and the whole place felt quite dated and tired - like a nightclub that was converted into a restaurant  - with little real effort on making it feel like a restaurant.   All in all though the food was good and good value - I will likely return, i just hope that they clean up the place a bit more, because the place is fun and good value."}
{"text":"Avoid unless you are foraging for supplies following the apocalypse.   This is the worst sushi restaurant in Calgary.     The floors? Greasy.   The tables? Dirty.   The bathrooms?  Stink City.  And the food really just kinda sucks.  Ordering from an iPad would be kind of a neat thing ... if you got what you actually ordered.  Once every 10 minutes or so, a sort of gruff lady shoved food at us that wasn't ours.  My lady friend didn't get the salad she ordered.  We left before it all became too much to bear.  At $65-ish dollars for the two of us... it was not a deal."}
{"text":"Was excited to try out this All You Can Eat Sushi place that my friend recommended. I thought the concept of ordering on an ipad was cool.. I was wrong.   You'd order on the ipad but then you'd have to wait for a server to come to approve your order. It took us longer than it should have to get a servers attention.   When our first few dishes arrived, we realized that we didn't have saucers for the soy sauce.. Waited for a server to come by but it took too long so we took it from another table..   After that we realized we weren't given wasabi or ginger, so we then had to try again to get a servers attention. That took too long and by the time a server came by, we already finished our first round of dishes.   It was hard to get the servers attention, and they would walk past our table as if we didn't exist. There was one time where we pressed on the ipad for the server to come to us, she walked past us and saw the notification on the ipad and walked away still.   We ordered tempura and by the time it came out.. We realized after the server gave us the dish, that the tempura didn't have it's dipping sauce. So AGAIN, we had to get the servers attention..   The service I had, you can obviously tell that they were slacking. Customer service is terrible. And one of the waiters at this restaurant kept touching his hair and face.. And that's obviously unsanitary."}
{"text":"Their sushi tastes good! But that was about it. Everything for me lacked flavour, as if all the sauce were watered down, from the dressing on their salad to their drinks. Tempura was meh and they didn't even ask us how we'd want our beef cooked. If we do eat here again I'll try more of their foods. The servers seemed like they lack training, like I'm not being picky but they weren't even that busy when we were there. Giving it two stars coz our server was cute!"}
{"text":"By way of \"all you can eat\" places, this one's pretty good. I'm not the best person to review these sorts of places as I generally find the food quality to be a bit lower and I'm not a major eater so the price tag doesn't sway me. Anyway, my friends drag me here and I like their massive massive menu. You order from an iPad which is nifty, but potentially insanitary. Anyway, I'm content."}
{"text":"Oh lordy, where do I start?  We arrived. \"Please Wait to be Seated\". Several servers everywhere, we finally got someone's attention and they sat us after a wait. They told us that for $27/person we can order as much of anything we want off the menu! SWEET, let's do this.  The waitress did a good job of explaining the iPad menu ordering system to us, but this in the end was the place's undoing. We ordered one round of assorted items (the menu is really big, which is great!) the items began coming quickly, and then slower, and slower and so slow that we had to flag down a server (they must've been short staffed, since it was the afternoon of NYE) each time to get them to manually remind the kitchen of what we ordered. We didn't get everything we ordered, but we got most of it, and decided we were ready for round two. We ordered another bunch of rolls, sashimi, and desserts. This time we received maybe 2 of the 10 things we ordered and had to find someone to remind them of each of the rest. It was tiresome. We waited nearly two hours to get the simple orders.  There is clearly a big flaw in the iPad ordering system. You cannot just send the order to the kitchen, the waitress does that for you, and there's no way to use the iPad to communicate/ring over a server, as I've seen at all other places with iPad menus. The waitress was nice, but man, there was nothing we could do. Eventually, she told us some of the things we ordered were sold out and said we could have ice cream instead of mango pudding. She took our flavour orders and within seconds returned with the wrong flavours for each of us.   We were still missing several things from our second round at this point and decided to just leave. HOWEVER, at that moment the waitress swooped by with two shot glasses full of pink jelly stuff, said nothing, and left. We sniffed it. Was it... cold pepto bismol? It LITERALLY could not have been anything else. We tried it, it was undeniably that sweet, medicinal taste. Whattttttt the?  The food in general was fine, but nothing to write home about. The presentation was actually embarrassingly awful sometimes. I guess that's what happens when you get \"All You Can Eat\".   Okay, we are outta here. We went to the check out where they said, yay! 10% off your meal because it's NYE. That's nice. I pull out my mastercard and she says, oh but the 10% only applies if you pay in cash. Okay, nevermind.  This place gets two stars because I think if it were a quieter day and they were properly staffed, it would've been maybe even fun to order on an iPad and eat all the sushi you can! I won't risk going back to find out, though."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for a friend's birthday.  The place is very nice I like the mini bridge from the entrance. The booth was comfortable. The floor was wet and slippery though and I almost fell a couple of times.  The service was low to medium quality. They were slow to take our plates and the food took forever to get as well. But then again there was a total party of 20 and the food trickles out of the kitchen.  Their iPad menu is super wicked cool though. I think they can improve it more by showing which items ordered that were already delivered. It's hard to track with 20 people. It would also help for the time estimates remaining.  The price is pretty okay for an all you can eat. It isn't really competitive pricing, it's you know, Calgary pricing. Lol.  The food was good, not astounding. Nothing really to note about just that it's okay. Not impressive and not bad. That's why my rating is mediocre. Not a totally bad service, and not totally bad food. So 3/5 is my score. It's more than 50%."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE, AWFUL, and POORLY executed restaurant. The quality and portion size of the various dishes, whether it be Japanese or Chinese, HORRIBLE. if yelp allowed a half star rating, this establishment would warrant it. Food is haphazardly put together and devoid of any flavour; dishes are flavourless. Major DISAPPOINTMENT."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls and nigiri had little distinct flavor between them except for being very fishy. Shrimp tempura was not de-veined and was filled with black stuff. Gross. $60 for two AYCE orders is fair value, I suppose, but for quality this poor, I will never go back.  Positive points for prompt service, though it seems not all patrons are so lucky. I can forgive the plastic utensils and dishware, this place essentially being a sushi buffet. The iPad ordering system is nice, but ours was dirty and sticky with sauce. I didn't really want to touch it."}
{"text":"The hubby and I love this place! We have brought many friends here, who already have their favourite sushi locations, and they have been thoroughly impressed with the service and the quality of the food. The reason I only give it 4 stars is it is a little on the pricey side, at 25 bucks a person, however you can definitely take advantage being that it is all you can eat! I've been 5-7 times, just the first few of many!"}
{"text":"Terrible service! From the time you enter the resturant you realize no one cares about customers here! I stayed 1.5 hours and submitted two sets of orders but didn't get any thing! Got a few items all wrong. Don't waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"We received a bad service even before we got seated. We were standing waiting for a server to seat us for 5-10 minutes. When we got to our seat we had to wait for another 5-10 minutes because the table wasnt prepared. When we ordered our food, we had to wait for it because they serve it one by one instead of being served all together. They didnt serve the appetizer fast. The taste would've been better if the food was serve less than 30 mins. We were there for 1 hour getting only bad services. To add on that, it WASN'T busy at all."}
{"text":"This place sucks. They ran out of fish at a sushi restaurant way before the closing time. Only about 1/4 of our orders came. The waitress spilt leftover tataki juice onto my boyfriend's shirt and jeans and didn't even apologize. All 17 of us would not be coming here again. I highly recommend you don't go here."}
{"text":"Not bad sushi at all for all you can eat.....one thing you need to be careful of is how much you order at the start. If you order too much the server will judge your amount and bitch that it's too much to eat and demand you take some off.  So, in other words....rude servers. You will also wait for a bit at the front as they don't seem to have a dedicated host/hostess, which is important.  Also beware that if you order above your first order it seems to take longer and longer to get your orders. We waited over 20 minutes for some items and just gave up and left.   Their level of service seriously needs to improve if they want to keep customers coming."}
{"text":"This sushi place might be called The One but as sushi places go it isn't \"the one\". Is it good? Yes, but the reviews so far seem to be a little inflated. Maybe everyone is mesmerized by the iPad menu they throw at you.  The interior is very basic. It would seem that they just did a \"lipstick\" renovation. They painted, put in new flooring, and new furniture, but there's nothing really giving this place an identity of their own. They have also kept the old blinds from the previous Chinese buffet which look terrible.  The dinner AYCE is $27.95 + tax. I thought this was a little pricey. Its a couple dollars more than other places I've gorged at.   This is what I had:  House salad - Standard salad you find at any sushi place. Tasty but a little watery like the lettuce was soaking in a bucket of cold water.  Green dragon roll - Mediocre. A good sized portion but not the best I've had.  Dynamite roll - Very underwhelming. There was no kick at all.   Snapper rose sushi - Quite tasty and fresh.  Salmon sushi - Excellent as with most sushi places. Size of sushi seems a bit smaller than non-AYCE places.  Snapper sushi - Same comments as the Salmon sushi.  General Tao Chicken - Nice and hot, crispy, and crunchy veggies thrown in the mix. A good dish worth giving a try.  Bulgogi - Meh. It was good, but if you want bulgogi go to a place that specializes in it.  Broccoli tempura - Mushy floret with a crunchy stem.  Sweet potato tempura - Hot and tasty, though a little greasy.  Deep fried banana - Really good. You should probably order two or three at a time as the portion is quite small.  Fried milk - An interesting pudding-like consistency with a crunchy exterior.  Overall this place is good. The food came out quickly and the staff were very attentive and pleasent."}
{"text":"The food was good tonight, came out really fast which was awesome. Sadly, our table was dirty, our servers were non existent tonight and weren't on top of drinks like they usually are.   They switched to disposable chopsticks which is the first time I've seen it. My green tea came in a giant plastic soda glass. Also a first and totally a wtf moment.   Its still the best AYCE sushi in town and worth the money even with the annoyances tonight."}
{"text":"Excellent ordering system along with delicious Sushi, easily the best quality sushi for all you can eat and it's not even a contest."}
{"text":"All I really have to say is EEW!  On my first and last trip to \"The One\" I was greeted by a run down and filthy parking lot - eew.   The first warning sign to keep out should have been the sticky front door handle - eew. Despite this I ventured in hoping for better inside.  Disappointment was soon to follow.   As I walked with the server to my table, it felt as though my shoes may remain permanent residents of this feeble attempt at a restaurant - what could possibly be so sticky on the floor of a sushi place?... eew.   The ipad ordering system is neat. The ipad itself was as sticky as the floor - eew.   The table had a sticky, slimy, smelly sheen of some indescribable nature - eew.   The only redeeming quality is the service. The waitresses were polite, helpful and efficient.  Rated separately, I would give the service a 5/5.   The food was generally ok.  However the tuna had a spongy texture and a strange scent - eew.  I remember reading somewhere that spongy tuna can result from improper storage. This prompted my in-restaurant search of the Alberta health restaurant inspection reports - EEW!   Do yourself a favor before your visit to \"The One\". Ask your old pal google to help you find this restaurant on the Alberta health website - EEW!"}
{"text":"Service is much better than at the other location!  The food is great and was brought out to us very quickly."}
{"text":"We had a dinner buffet for lunch  It was really good I recommend the salmon black snow And their fried milk is good to The only downer was we have to wait for 40 minutes for 2 ice cream. And they didnt want to take the bill -_-"}
{"text":"Had lunch here, it was Ok. The iPad thing was interesting as you can see clearly what you are getting. The lunch deal (all you can eat for $16), was reasonable. I would come back, but the selection is not huge if you pick from the iPad (best is to ask the servers).   The ambience could be improved as it feels kind of dark, and not very authentic. The taste was ok and portions were good so it was the presentation. You cannot see how they preparing it (like in Kinjo).The servers were very pleasant and easy to talk to. Funny thing is that they are not suited to order outside of the iPad.  With so many choices in Calgary to eat great Sushi, this one needs to have some more pizazz. Just iPads alone does not cut it for me."}
{"text":"When it first opened, I would have given this place 3 stars, especially since the AYCE sushi scene in Calgary isn't huge. The food, service, and hygiene of the restaurant has gone down BIG TIME since then.   The good:  - don't have to worry about parking as there is a big enough private lot  - good price for AYCE  - big restaurant so usually not a long wait   The bad:  - the food...... everything from the rice to the fish is just not good anymore. The rice was dry, the avocados were brown, and the presentation of the rolls was just sad. I understand that you can't expect too much with AYCE but this was bad, even for an AYCE restaurant.  - the service: we didn't get water or tea until we asked at least 5 times. We weren't given soy sauce or wasabi until after a bunch of the sushi already arrived at the table (to the point that I had to get up and find a waitress to ask for it).  The ugly:  - the cleanliness: dusty and dirty in general, and as you can see in some of the reviews posted by others, the dirty plates are just left lying around.   Overall, spend the extra $1-$2 and get AYCE sushi somewhere else...ANYWHERE else"}
{"text":"Gross. Disgusting. Over priced. Service is crap. Your food is tossed and slid across the table. The salad bar consisted of dried lettuce and dried lettuce. Only reason I went was because there was a coupon. Even then? Won't go again if it were free."}
{"text":"I have stopped in twice to try and eat here only to be ignored by all staff while I was standing at the front door. Both times were mid-afternoon, not busy and there were plenty of staff walking around (who saw me but would apparently not seat me). I gave them the benefit of the doubt and made the second visit. I will not be visiting this place ever again and would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"Came for a late afternoon lunch and managed to catch the lunch ayce menu. We enjoyed the large varity of items offered for the smaller menu. I had been commenting how I would love some dim sum pork dumplings and low and behold they offer that also on the lunch ayce. Severs were all very pleastant and the atmosphere was nice. My date commented more than a few times on how much she liked the lighting. Sushi was tasty and well made, the green dragon roll was very nice. I think we have found our goto sushi place for NE Calgary!"}
{"text":"Good food, great price.  We had the lunch buffet and were pleasantly surprised to learn that they were charging about half the price of similar restaurants. This is an all-you-can eat seated buffet restaurant. You put in your order using iPads provided, and your server delivers the food to you after it's been prepared.   The food was good. I can't say that it was anything amazing but I did enjoy it. I definitely recommend the dynamite hand roll, it is delicious. The servers did not speak much clear English, but were very friendly and also very speedy.   One thing that bothered me though was that there was a slight smell, almost like sewage. This was only noticeable when first walking into the restaurant and then again while paying but to someone with a sensitive nose it would likely be off-putting."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service and TERRIBLE food!!! No one ask welcome when I came to store, no refill drinking all the time!! After order around 15mins, just got some small dishes! The rice of roll is really dry! This is my first and LAST time been here!!!!"}
{"text":"The food it's ok,but It's terrible, bad service, really bad service,all mad face.only 6 table , really slow."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you come with a large group and want to be frustrated with long wait times. It was a busy Friday night and our group of 8 had to wait up to 45 min for an order of sushi. My order of fried rice and a sides of stir fried veggies or of ginger would come before the sushi. I figured that those non sushi items would arrive before anything else because there's only two or three chefs making sushi in the kitchen. Groups of 8+ requires gratuity of 12%. Not really worth it, since the service was poor and understaffed with just 2 servers for the restaurant.   Generally most of the sushi orders were cancelled as we needed to leave having waited for over 2 hours for a decent meal to feed us. None of us were familiar with the ordering system and some of the orders were waiting in the iPad menu until we clicked sent. At the end of the night, I end up paying close to $50 just for myself. I had the feeling everyone in our group would not return again. If I wanted a decent meal at that price I would have gone somewhere else.   I can imagine that lunch buffet or mid week would be decent."}
{"text":"NOT GOING BACK AGAIN!!!  Normally restaurants offer all-u-can-eat using order sheets to order, but The One Sushi uses iPAD to order instead. The thing's it didn't save any time. Even you can just touch on what u want to order, it actually doesn't order automatically. You still need to wait for a waitress to come to your table and put in code to send for you.  The menu was too international, so it's more like buffet, not sushi all-u-can-eat. Especially when the sushi and sashimi were not good. The sushi rich was so so so sweet, I felt like I was eating sugar, a lot of sugar....And I think the way they cut the sashimi was not how the Japanese did. The hot dishes, basically almost all of them using the same ingredients, but just mixing with different sauces. If they're good I do not mind, but they were not."}
{"text":"Based on my experience this place is pretty good.  I paid $17 for all you can eat with a bunch of friends and it was a good time.  Although it was a slow day and we probably wouldn't get that much attention normally, based on that sole experience the service and food were A-OK. Food portions are kinda small but it's all you can eat so whatever."}
{"text":"Summary: - Food appears and feels fresh - Sashimi can be frozen sometimes - Sushi and sashimi usually takes a long wait - Unique and easy-to-use ordering system: ipads - Price is acceptable for sushi buffet ~$29 per person - Large selections of sushi, tempura and bbq - Relatively clean and classy environment - Service quality ranges from great to satisfactory"}
{"text":"I came across this restaurant from fellow Yelper's reviews.  Coming from Toronto where there are many AYCE sushi restaurants,  I had to try it.  The decor is simple and has a large dining room. The servers were friendly and courteous.   This restaurant will do well because it is a new trend in ordering.  They use a tablet ordering system where you place your order and a server will then come by to send the order through to be made.  Service was a bit slow and food comes out in batches.  We ordered many of their rolls and sushis.  Flavours were ok but nothing special.  The fish was sliced very thin and there was a lot of rice in their rolls. Not your typical sushi.  We also ordered some hot dishes: chicken curry, lemon chicken and corn soup which were ok.  For an AYCE, it's just OK. Nothing special but for $28 you can fill up on a lot!"}
{"text":"So I would say that this is a 3-star place with a 4-star value (especially for lunch). This is not just all-you-can-eat sushi, but there are also a variety of appetizers and hot/cooked meals as well. There are also some desserts (like ice cream and fried bananas) plus beverages on the menu. There is a really an extensive menu for such a place - you could fill yourself up and not try half the menu.   There are a variety of rolls, fusion, traditional, cones, sushi, and sashimi. There are soups, salads, and stir fry's that are also on the menu. You get an iPad for the table and you select all of the things you want and flag the server when you want to place the order. You can do this as many times as you want. It's $17 for lunch and $27 for dinner, per person. You can't go and not eat nor can you do take away so it really is as much as you can eat at that moment. To get your money's worth you really should go hungry.  The taste/flavor of the food was probably about 3/3.5 stars. The ingredients were pretty good/fresh. The rice on the sushi was good (not enough rice vinegar though), and the fish was fresh. The hot dishes were not phenomenal but also had a solid flavor.They were a nice way to break up the sushi.   This is a big place with a private room and tons of open tables. It seems like a great place for groups, but it does have a distinctly fishy smell when you walk in so you can't really go with anyone that doesn't like fish."}
{"text":"Magnifying glasses required!   Ordered take out and surprised to see how small the sushi was. It tasted good, but very very small. Never take out again from this place. Maybe the all you can eat You might get enough food to fill yourself up."}
{"text":"The One Sushi is nicely decorated with a clean modern decor. It does currently look a bit sparse in some sections, makes me think if they could have laid out the seating a bit better but it's not that busy right now so it works. I imagine when it gets busier they could probably rearrange the place to fit more tables.  The host/server Jay welcomed us at the front, very friendly and courteous. He let us know that it was their soft opening week and kindly warned us that service might be a bit slower than usual as their chefs were already working in over-drive. I was a bit worried when I sat down, thinking the food would take forever to come out, but was pleasantly surprised when our appetizers (miso soups, seaweed salad, edamame) came out relatively quickly and the kitchen foods (fried rice) came out soon after. It did take a little bit longer for the rolls and sashimi to come out but I wouldn't say I felt I was waiting long, especially when you're eating your other dishes anyway.  The quality of the fish and rolls were excellent!! I moved to Calgary from Toronto last summer and have been relatively disappointed in the quality of the sushi places in the area, but The One Sushi surprised me!! The quality was great especially for an AYCE place. I had tried Ichiban previously and was super disappointed (never went back a 2nd time).  The price is $27.95 for an adult dinner every day of the week. Lunch is $16.95 M-F and $17.95 Sat/Sun and Holidays. Be aware though the lunch menu is different, at the very least I know they don't serve sashimi for lunch.   The menu system is on an iPad. You select the orders you want and send the order through. It takes a while to submit, but PROTIP if you don't want to wait you can ask any server that walks by and they punch in some code and it sends right away. Another tip is that the menu items that have not been sent through remain white in colour in the order list, and the ones that have been sent through successfully are yellow in colour. This was helpful for us to determine which items actually went through.  I would say my favourite menu item was the Salmon handroll. The pieces of fish in the handroll were HUGE, fish to rice ratio was definitely large. I think I ate 3 =P.  I would recommend everyone goes to try it now rather than later, because you never know when a place gets popular/busy what will happen to the quality and service. Let's hope it stays the same because I am definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Horrible food, atmosphere and service. The place is dirty, too. Zero value for money. These people do nothing well.  Won't ever be back."}
{"text":"The one sushi that my wife ate turned into a second, third and so on.  The food was good and the atmosphere, although strange, was fitting for a Calgary eatery.  It does not look like a sushi place but was enjoyable.    The wife approved."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a few times, and I must say it's a rather enjoyable experience. The service is awesome, the food is amazing, and the ambience is casual and comfortable. They also have a private room for parties."}
{"text":"Update 2018: we stopped going to this place after a couple of horrendous service experiences. The location is now closed...maybe something to do with the service. However I think I saw them relocated to NE Calgary. Maybe that location is doing better and would meet the expectations after I first posted the following review in 2015. ...   More than just sushi. The decor is contemporary and modern - except the window blinds, but they are hardly noticeable in a very large room. The seating was clean and very comfy. They can accommodate large tables of people and I also noticed a door labeled 'party room'.  With a baby in tow, I was pleased that they had high chairs ` that were new and clean! Not the wooden ones that are covered in food, but plastic, rounded, sleek, white, modern high chairs (that went well with the decor!)  We were seated fairly quickly, although diners arriving later seemed to wait a little while for a server to come around to seat them as they didn't seem to have a designated host/hostess. The server asked if we'd been there before and proceeded to explain their system quite well. Their menu is on an iPad that you select your items on, and the server checks the order before submitting. Once an item has been received, the menu item on the iPad turns to yellow, which helped us keep track of what we ordered and what was left to come. I liked how they broke the menu down to categories, including the usual appetizers, rolls, specialty rolls, desserts, but also Korean, Spicy, Soups, etc.   We ordered several rolls, sushi and sashimi. Most were quite good, some were really great like the black snow roll, a couple were just ok. We also had some dishes like pad thai, deep fried cheese wontons, a beef and mushroom bite, and thai soup, which were all quite tasty. The sizes are perfect to share a few bites of each and since it's AYCE, you can always order another plate if you want more. For dessert we ordered deep fried milk (very interesting and worth a try - especially at an AYCE) and deep fried bananas. Both come with two pieces per dish, which is a perfect sized finish to a large meal - the bananas went great with the chocolate ice cream we also ordered!  The food came out at a good pace to give us time to eat without shoving food down our gullets to clear plates. They were also quite good at clearing the plates once they were done. The only challenge with service was catching one to ask for something else like extra napkins or more tea - but were pleasant and prompt once you did catch them. They didn't explain to us how the bill would come, so they may want to do that when they explain the menu at the beginning of your experience. You take the iPad to the desk - which is near the kitchen rather than the front of the restaurant. Seems like an odd place in the middle of the restaurant, but it will likely reduce a congested front entrance when it's busy.  Nothing we ordered was unsatisfactory and I liked some of the different rolls I haven't seen at other restaurants, but I wouldn't say there was a dish that really blew me away. It was good sushi and at $28 for all you can eat, I'll definitely be back. Great variety, everything was tasty, the service was welcoming, and we were well satisfied when we left."}
{"text":"Parking 5/5 lots of parking   Service 2/5 the service when we first got there was great. Then the longer we were there the food stopped coming out. The staff were busy cleaning up to close even though they had well over 1 more hour.   Environment 3/5 nothing spectacular just like any other restaurant   Food 2/5 food wasn't very fresh sloppily put together . Didn't taste great"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure that you must experience!  Located just Feet from the T & T Asian Supermarket !  This authentic Asian buffet, specializing in an extraordinarily large selection of wonderful Sushi, also features fresh, cooked to order selections!  That's why every single cooked selection is never reheated or dried out.  The staff and manager are polite, professional and the service is excellent!  My new favorite meeting place for friends and family! . Eddie L"}
{"text":"It's been in the Pacific place for a while and I am too chicken to try it out since it's sushi....I know if u can't finish it....you gotta pay.  Example you ordered 6 pics of California roll and didn't finish it...you gotta pay regular price of it on the menu.  The good side if it's your birthday they got discount 50% for the celebrant.  I took picture of their prices...since it varies.  As for the food...it's pretty good...my husband is picky so he said it made the list.  When you go in they give you a tablet. You order from it. They serve not only Japanese they got a few dimsum which is Chinese..they got Korean Thai as well...and dessert.  Their grilled salmon was good and I wanted to order again...and no I couldn't find it...I concluded that certain things you are only allowed to order 1x.  The other thing...don't order too much...sushi was slow to come out...and I kept on ordering...then got penalized. The portions are small but phase yourself if nothing comes out its not too late to order again.  They got the grilled shrimp...if u like to see the shell with the legs on it....then order it...  I would say everything was doing great until I payed my bill...the girl whom I think is a supervisor of sort...she was snobbish when I didn't give that much of a tip...since the service was slow...I wouldn't have ordered that much if all the sushi came out fast....coz the last 2 orders...I didn't include any sushi...  Hence the end stars....I would go back and eat...maybe lunch time not dinner...if u give tiny tip...you will be forgotten so make sure you get all you need from your server...  By my observation....most of them are Chinese....if heard few Japanese words...but then again it's loud and noisy...it's pretty good for a non Japanese chef.  Oh I gave it 3 stars coz...one of the sushi chef sneezed and didn't close  his mouth or sneezed away...my hubby saw the whole thing...it was not sanitary at all!"}
