{"text":"We came here on a Friday night for a nice evening out. After having read a number of reviews we were quite eager to give The Guild a try ourselves. Overall, the location/decorations/interior are very cool. It's crazy sitting in the restaurant and thinking that it used to be the first floor of the Bay! However, the food wasn't anything spectacular in my opinion. 

The service was wonderful, we had a reservation and the host(s) were extremely friendly. The server offered excellent suggestions and was quick to check on us throughout the evening. 

As far as food... we ordered the pork belly appetizer which was on special. It was my favourite part of the meal by far! I had the brisket for my main, it was exactly as described, a huge chunk of beef brisket. The sauce was tasty, but since there was so much brisket I felt that that the majority of the meat had very little flavour. Which was fine, but nothing amazing. It came with a bit of quinoa and corn salad which was meh. Overall it was exactly as advertised, but nothing special.

The boyfriend ordered the lamb shoulder which came with dandelion greens and some smoked mash. Again, huge chunk of meat which was well cooked but nothing special. The smoked mash was really good, but there wasn't a lot of it (or of the dandelion greens which was probably for the best in my opinion). We also shared the carrot cake for dessert. 

Overall the food was good, exactly as advertised, but nothing wow or different outside of the appetizer in my opinion. The location is cool and worth stopping in for but I doubt we will be back considering the other wonderful restaurant options in Calgary with the same/similar price point."}
{"text":"A friend and I saw The Guild on the BlogTo brunch list and decided to check it out. We arrived at 9:50 and the restaurant didn't open until 10, but our server asked if we wanted coffee and let us in shortly after, coffee ready at our table! The restaurant had quite a few tables, a bar area overlooking Dundas St and cute decor. 

We shared both of the brunch specials which were recommended by our server... a brie and lobster omelette and braised beef pancakes which would have been too rich to eat a full plate of, but half of each was perfect. There was a mix up in the kitchen so our food took a while, but coffee was on the house and we got free apple fitters while we waited for the food which were delicious!  Overall the food was great and the service was amazing. Such friendly staff who were quick to make up for the delayed food. Would definitely recommend giving The Guild a try!"}
{"text":"Could have been so much more.  

I love going to new restaurants when they just open because that's usually when they are at their best.  They pull out all the stops and with that knowledge, you hope you go in for a memorable time.

Unfortunately, it was just decent.  When we asked our waiter about the menu, she barely knew the intricacies about it.  She couldn't even tell me whether the tritip or the sirloin was better since she didn't know what these cuts were!  Maybe we were just unlucky here but that obviously put us off right away as she did not seem confident about the menu.  After we ordered, we waited 1 hour before any food showed up.  It didn't seem too busy either which suggests that it's not a really a smooth sailing ship here.  While only opened a few weeks ago, that's still rather unacceptable in my opinion.

When the food came, it was only decent too.  My wife ordered the bacon wrapped trout and it was burnt.  They tried to cover it up by putting the burnt side down but when she took a look under, it was all black.  In retrospect, we should have said something and returned it but at that point, we were so hungry so we just ate it.  Maybe that's why it took an hour for the food to show up; it's because they forgot they were cooking and therefore burnt it all. 

As for the dessert, it was a mixed-bag too.  The Whiskey bread pudding was super gooey and with just the right amount of sweetness.  It's definitely the star of our meal.  Unfortunately, I had the flourless chocolate tart and it was extremely sweet.  I wouldn't recommend this one.

All in all, a meddling experience.  A couple of high points with the nice ambience and whiskey bread pudding, but slow and uneducated staff, burnt fish and a rather boring menu means I will not go back.  It was nice of them to comp the wine as an acknowledgement of their mistakes, but why go to a place that makes so many mistakes in the first place?  Your time and money deserves better."}
{"text":"$39 for ribs that was hard and burnt. After I complained, she asked why I almost finished it? There was nothing much there and I was trying to be nice and see if it could redeem itself along the way. It was my first ribs too as I don't eat pork and this was beef ribs. I go there whenever I'm in Calgary on business but I won't be going anymore. They should have at least comped the burnt meal after I complained. They offered \"free dessert\". But this is not good enough for me. Expensive place trying to be stellar but failed. The wild mushroom side dish was too salty also. 

Should u have to go there, order the onion rings and the brisket. That's it."}
{"text":"I will update my review if we go back sometime. The hostess was rude. Talked down to me like I was beneath her or something. Very strange. Felt like I was 21 trying to get into a club or something."}
{"text":"I just came across The Guild today and decided to check it out. They were able to easily accommodate a last minute reservation. The Guild is a medium size restaurant and has a basic but trendy decor. 

The woman who welcomed and served us was really pleasant and helpful. I had a few questions about the entr√©e options and she was able to provide some real advice and recommendations. 

I had oysters to start. They are $2 per shuck which is pretty good. They get their oysters daily fresh from oyster boy. Tonight they were east coast oysters from NB and they were pretty tasty, albeit on the small side. But not bad for $2. 

For my main, I had the lobster capinelli. The pasta was home made on location and they had fairly large chucks of real (not canned) lobster. 

My friend had the grilled mushrooms (which was delicious) and the trout. Both were extremely flavourful. For desert he had the curry apple fritters which were not bad at all. 

All in all I have to say I was impressed with this meal and enjoyed the overall experience. 

The price was a little high but overall reasonable in my mind with a couple of drinks each. I believe out total after tax was around $115. 

Worth a try if you're in area"}
{"text":"The Guild has just opened in the old Bay building on Steven Avenue. We stopped in for lunch after the Stampede parade and we're all around wowed. This was their first official day being open and they succeeded on all levels for us. 

The service was amazing and attentive even though they were very very busy due to the thousands of people that flood through the core after the parade. We did not wait or want for anything during our visit. 

The food was excellent. They focus on locally sourced fresh ingredients and it shows in all of their dishes. We had quite a few items from the nibbles menu including the chips and the fried calamari. All of the dishes came out looking beautiful and were perfectly seasoned. We also had the Margherita pizza with a beautiful thin crust that is actually a bannock dough. 

Even the drinks are locally sourced with local beers and provisions from Eau Claire Distillery. 
They have done a great job with the decor and renovations from the meat aging cooler and beautiful dining room right down to the bathrooms with beautiful antique style sinks, taps and mirrors. They also have a great and very large patio perfect for enjoying a libation and people watching! 

A little something to note is they are currently running a Stampede menu (I highly recommend the Sangria is was excellent and a great price) and will start their regular menu July 21. 

I am looking forward to returning in the very near future and would highly recommend a visit for anyone looking for a great new place!"}
{"text":"Fantastic setting. The bartenders enjoy making the mixed drinks and their passion comes out in the quality of the beverage. Steak frites for lunch was delicious. The mac n cheese bites for a snack hit the spot. Challenge on the patio can be the wildlife on Stephen Ave."}
{"text":"Service was very slow.   We waited over an hour for our main dishes after we ordered.   Steak was tough and the gazpacho too salty.   The pavlova was tough tough and difficult to eat.   Presentation could be bettet"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE. If you are hungry don't eat here you will wait forever for mediocre food and rude/ insulting service. 

I will not be back. Slow and rude not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch about four times in the past few months and each of my visits has been phenomenal. 

The service is excellent. Once, they ran out of an ingredient the waiter ran to the corner store, no questions asked. The service is always attentive and able to make great recommendations. 

The food is unique. Although they serve traditional style dishes (e.g., bacon and eggs) but all of them have a unique twist that make them special. I've always been impressed. 

My last thumbs up is that they take reservations. Take note other restaurants..."}
{"text":"For having just opened about a week ago, they're running a pretty good show. 

Went here for Sunday brunch and everything was just right. First of all we were able to make reservations for brunch, which I believe is a rare thing in Toronto. The hostess was friendly and inviting. It was the right amount of busy. The Guild has a bright and eclectic interior with fresh white tulips in vases and mason jar terrariums placed throughout the tables. You can see right into the kitchen at the back, I like to see what the chef is up to! 

We ordered a couple cocktails to start which were twists on a mimosa. They had cute names like \"A Dundas Morning\". The food itself is excellent. I had gnocchi with boar, a cream sauce and saut√©ed greens. Piping hot as it should be when it arrived. Perfect portion size. Everything cooked just right (gnocchi can be tough to get right, but they did it!) and the boar was tender and moist. My friend had a traditional breakfast, with unique elements like sous vide poached eggs sitting in little Yorkshire puddings, thick cut maple dipped bacon and a goat cheese yam gratin. The service was great too. 

All in all, I was impressed by the decor, service and especially the food! I'm definitely coming back to try their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"I was at Guild for a function recently and the menu was restricted to certain items off the menu.  I had the steak tartare and bone marrow.  This is the first time I have had bone marrow that was not hot and I felt like I was eating lard.  The tartare was good but could have used a little more salt.  I had the roasted half chicken with house chips, cheese curds, bacon, peas, and chicken gravy (in other words, a poutine so why don't they just call it that).  I have to say the the roasted chicken was excellent and some of the best chicken I have eaten at a restaurant.  The meat was moist, including the breast.  However, this entree chicken was ruined this \"poutine'- the fries were luke warm, not very well cooked, and was not good, not goodat all.  In summary, this potato dish was a mess.  In my opinion, I think that The Guild may think about new sides for this otherwise superb roast chicken.  I would probably go back to this restaurant again but try something different.   The Guild is not one the top ten restaurants that I would choose to dine at in the downtown core."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Calgary.  Let me start with the disgusting pig's head hanging at the front door which we found unappetizing as a start.  Maybe the Toronto owners think there is a different culture in Calgary?  Well think again!
The smell in this restaurant was terrible - not sure if it was dead fish coming from the open kitchen but it wasn't good.  
Wait staff were slow and told us the kitchen was 30 minutes behind but we thought we'd still give them a chance. 
Drinks came out slow and were small and disappointing. 
The tartar was small, underwhelming flavour and served on a bone which was also unappetizing.  
I could go on - and would give them one more chance - but for gosh sakes wait a few months until they iron out the very large wrinkles. 
Awful experience for our first Saturday night there."}
{"text":"I ordered the West Coast Octopus, amazing !!!!!
The combination of flavors is great, absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"The space is beautiful in a modern industrial way. The food was amazing, though the portions were a bit small for the price. I usually like smaller portions but the price may have been a bit high. The service was good, although slow at times, as it appeared our waitress had a lot of tables to attend to. The biggest downside for this resto, in my opinion, was the location of the restrooms. You had to go down three flights of stairs to reach them and, though it wasn't terrible for our purposes, I think it would get kind of annoying if you were here for drinks only and had to make many trips downstairs."}
{"text":"Charcuterie plate needs a bit more for the price and the old fashioned was a bit sweet for my liking.  Otherwise the house made chorizo was good and the pork shoulder was cooked perfectly tender."}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable evening with out of town friends who came to visit. The atmosphere is electric and nicely appointed. All of the staff were exceptionally friendly and attentive. Between the ribs (which need to be ordered as a full rack if you are hungry), the bison shank and the brisket the Bison shank won hands down. 

My only negative comment would be that the meals come with no extras unless they are listed on the menu and side dish amounts were one person size. Subsiquently the bill was quite large. 

Great food, good service but not at all sure we will be back because of the cost."}
{"text":"I can't decide if I like this place. I want to, I really do. I've walked past a few times and the decor looked super cool. People who have gone here for drinks have said there's an extensive cocktail and beer menu - which I've looked at it and there's definitely a variety.

But our team lunch here was just meh. Nothing on the menu really caught my eye and I settled on the opened faced club house sandwich, as did my coworker. My boss was convinced by our server to have \"The Guild\" salad, which he claimed he ate pretty much every other day - which had to be good right?

Our food came out and it looked really appetizing. My club house had a different twist to it: pulled roast chicken, chicken crackling and a smokey mayo - very tasty! The \"house made ketchup\" I could have done without. It was like a sweet tomato paste? Out of habit, I kept dipping my fries into it and it ruined my delicious fries :(

My boss' salad was pretty much inedible. By process of elimination, we tried to figure out why it was so unbelievably salty. It wasn't the beans & asparagus, pancetta or goat cheese that was placed on top of the salad. We determined the pieces of mixed greens that were soaked in dressing was what made the salad so off putting. 

We weren't able to get our server's attention throughout our meal, so by the time he finally came to our table it was to clear mine and my coworker's empty plates and my boss' barely eaten salad. We did tell him about the dressing being too salty, to which he rectified by removing it from our bill and apparently had the chef taste, throw out and make a new batch.

Our experience left a bad taste in our mouths (literally!), so I'm not sure if I'd head back here anytime soon. It's quite pricy ($18 for a sandwich) and nothing on the menu appealed to me."}
{"text":"I have eaten at The Guild twice now, once in 2016 shortly after they opened up and it was very average, then again today as we couldn't get into the Cactus Club.  I ordered the brisket, and it was the worst tasting meal I have ever eaten in downtown Calgary.  The meat was extremely fatty, and it looks like a piece of chocolate cake when it comes out, but moves with the consistency of jello.  There was micro sides with the brisket as in leeks and such, but the taste of the brisket was comparable to something you would find in a frozen food grocery store.  The service was weak as well, as the hostess sat us at the very back while we past a dozen empty booths, so I asked for a booth instead and she complied after she walked all the way back to the front counter to verify.  The server also never came back to check in on us during the meal as I would have preferred a side salad to compliment the meal.  For a meal that was so small and pricey at $29, I am glad that I never had to pay for this meal.  The Guild must be a place for overflow for those customers who cannot get into quality restaurants.  This will be the last time I eat at The Guild, regardless who is paying!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool restaurant in a very cool location.

The patio alone is worth the visit; sitting outside along 8th under the archways of the historic Bay building it feels more akin to Europe than Calgary. 

Decent menu, good food, good wine selection, a touch pricy and service could be a bit quicker but, all in all, The Guild is the new standard in funky patio-dining experience.

T."}
{"text":"Meh for the price you can do better if looking for a meat oriented fine dining experience. 

I have been to the Bonnacini restaurants in Toronto this leaves a little to be desired. 

Beef tartare was the star. Excellent presentation and taste with thr bone marrow. 

However the salmon appetizer was quite bland and plain. 

Pork tenderloin was overcooked as was the brisket entrees. A little unacceptable for the caliber of restaurant advertised. 

Service was quite good  as was the atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a wonderful smoked brisket penne for a lunch special. Absolutely delicious. Tender and perfectly smoked. The Zin by the glasses goes excellent with it.

Bartender is polite and friendly and over bearing or in your face.

Excellent room, with the bar and kitchen behind, but all open, as the centre piece.

The Bay did a great thing opening this space up for the downtown client√®le

Thank you."}
{"text":"Unlike most Yelp reviewers let's cut to it!!!
Bad: the three flight hike to take a piss. I workout to go drink, not go to drink and workout. 
Good: the meat - sweet smoky goodness. 
Better: no f'in LCDs plastered to every wall. 
BEST: this won't hold true for all servers but I haven't had service like this in a very long time. Five f'kin star. Thanks DRE. U da bomb girl. 

PT."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've had in years! I had the chorizo and eggs and my husband had the traditional breakfast.  Everything was fresh and flavourful. The decor was very charming and the service staff was attentive and friendly.

Honestly, we were headed to the Federal and stopped here on a whim.  So glad we did! Food this fresh and at such a reasonable price is a rare gem. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our dinner here. Appetizers: beet salad with goat cheese and deviled eggs were awesome. Wife had the bison brisket and I had the NY strip. Kids enjoyed a flatbread. Everything was delicious. Our server, Taryn ( ID 6400) was the best we can recall. She went above and beyond to ensure we had an excellent family dinner. I highly recommend the restaurant and our awesome server!"}
{"text":"Terrific meal..an onion tarte tantin (sp) that was flavorful and well prepared. We sat on the patio and enjoyed our meal. The waiter was excellent. I would go back."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant. 

 We were greeted as soon as we walked in and promptly ushered to our reserved table. 

The atmosphere was very comfortable as for the bad reviews regarding the cuts of meet hanging at the front and the open window fridge displaying said cuts: this is the industry, this is a meat based restaurant, this is what your eating. If you can't face it - be a vegetarian and go to a vegetarian restaurant. 

The server was knowledgeable and guided us through all the specials. She was even kind enough to make a couple of suggestions. Our delicious drinks came promptly (a Old Fasioned and a Prosecco) as well.

Our food came quickly and the appetizers were timed perfectly with the mains. We ordered the Gin and Tonic Salmon, maybe not what I had expected but very delicious. We also ordered the Maple Brisket and Lamb Shank mains. I tell you - that was the best Lamb Shank since Chambar in Vancouver! 

I would have loved to try the Carrot Cake as I had heard so many good reviews about it but we were simply too full. 

All in all, I can't wait till I can go back."}
{"text":"Came to The Guild on Canada Day for dinner on their patio. Overall the experience was great, aside from expected slow service due to the holiday and also being understaffed. 

The patio is perfect for people watching and it has an old city feel, kind of like you aren't even in Calgary anymore.... Very cool vibe. 

I haven't dined inside so I cannot speak on the d√©cor or feel but I have visited the washrooms, and as weird as this sounds they are actually worth reviewing because they were so nice! There is also a cool \"speak easy\" bar in the basement that I want to try soon called Sub Rosa.

Back to the most important part... The food. We started off with the steak tar tare, it was delicious but I could have used a larger portion. For the mains I had the roasted chicken with a poutine as a side. It was the most juicy, flavourful chicken I have ever tasted! As for the poutine, I could have had 7 more side dishes of that beaut.

Solid 4 stars in my book."}
{"text":"The space is probably what I liked most. The food and drinks were good, but maybe a little overpriced. The roast chicken was well cooked and came with a side poutine.

If you're looking at dessert, get the bread pudding."}
{"text":"We walked in and didn't have a reservation so they asked if the bar was okay. We said yes and the hostess starting walking us towards the bar. Then she stopped and pointed to bar and said \"your seats are over there\" and left us. We didn't know which seats she meant because we were pretty far from the bar when she left us... so we just awkwardly went and sat in two spots. No one said hi, no one asked if we wanted any drinks and we had no menu. So I went back to the hostess table and asked for a menu. The girl asked where I was sitting (not the same girl who didn't lead us to the table) and told me that menus were at our seats already. Um why would I lie about not having menus?? We still hadn't been asked if we wanted a drink so I finally asked the bartender who was standing right in front of us (ignoring us) if we could have waters. He seemed friendly enough... but was too busy making drinks to be the server for the people sitting at the bar. After we got our drinks, no one came to take our order so I had to flag down another bartender. They took our order and I ordered a mushroom soup and my husband ordered a burger. There really aren't a lot of options for vegetarians... but that isn't uncommon. The food took forever and that mushroom soup was probably the worst soup I've ever tasted. It tasted burnt... which I don't even know how a soup can taste like that. My husband said his burger was pretty bad and his fries were overly oily. Overall, the service was really bad and the food was awful. Also, the actual decor looked great... however, what was with all the dead animal bodies hanging as decoration. Sorry, I don't eat meat and I don't want to look at dead, skinned animals while I eat. That's disgusting. We won't be going back and don't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"It's Thanksgiving weekend so there's Lots to be thankful for. My host / colleague / friend suggested The Guild so I went with her.

It's on STEPHEN ave very convenient to get to.
Atmosphere is exceptional. Love the way the Guild puts their places together. The decor makes you feel comfortable. Even the bathrooms are a nice theme.

Lamb burger was nice - not \"gamey\". Appreciated the ketchup. #Salad was #fresh & the dressing was well done. Simple & standard. 

Wine list was ok. Not the place for people looking for wine specifically.

Moderately priced. Lamb burger $18. 

To make it a better experience for me, I will need to see the food being slightly different, albeit I had a very limited experience with the food choice. Will need to try other things on the menu to change my opinion. We may revisit.

Service was good. Ma√Ætre D was nice. Chatted about the nice navy blue dress \"uniform\" which looks professional.

Great place for a discussion to close the week.  Happy Thanksgiving ?"}
{"text":"This review is all about the private dining area they have downstairs and the food we ate.

Was fortunate enough to snag an invite to dine at the Guild through Avenue magazine and what a fantastic treat this turned out to be. First off the space is just beautiful with seating along both side of the room and a long table set up for us in the middle. The bar at the end of the room is quite eye catching. I would just love to host an evening event here as the space would be incredibly versatile.

We were treated to a couple of passed hors d'oeuvres which consisted of octopus pieces (so soft), bloody mary oysters, ceaser bites (mixed seafood balls deep fried), while sitting along the banquette seating. We were also having wine from Mission Hill that complimented the food really well, and servers were very observant to refill glasses though the hors d'oeuvres and into dinner service.

Table was set beautifully for the meal with fresh produce used for the center pieces. The head waiter also made a point to ask everyone in the group individually about allergies (which we had noted previously) to make sure that the correct meal went to everyone. Really nice touch that takes the service above and beyond.

Started with gin & tonic salmon which was unreal! Pretty sure it had been cold smoked as slightly firm on the outside and sashimi soft on the inside, dill creme fraiche, tonic gel on each piece of salmon, and Hendricks gin soaked cucumber bites. Can we start every meal this way for the rest of all time? Just the most amazing flavour all together.

Mains were served family style. Everyone got a plated mini Braised Alberta veal and Quebec foie gras suet pie, say mini as they have this dish as a shared meal on their menu.
Along the table they had plates of octopus legs, which were glazed with something delicious and super soft - its hard to get octopus right and they did a great job. 
Slow roasted pigs head was served with the skin glazed to a hard crackling style. You lift the skin to get at all the meat inside. This is a fattier part of the pig, but the meat is incredibly soft and well flavoured.
They also had a dish called Prairie Pie - like shepherds pie but with bison + wild boar and smoked mashed potatoes. Unreal! This may be the best thing I have ever eaten. Really hope they put this on the main menu at some stage.

At this stage I was getting real full, but dessert was still to be served. Birch syrup Chomeur Pudding, with garama masala shortbread and gooseberries. The syrup put the sweetness in the dish and wasn't overpowering. Even though I am normally not a dessert person, I managed to eat over half my portion before I had to stop because I was just so full!

Over all, one of the best meals I have ever eaten. I am not sure what their regular service in the restaurant is like. Very impressed with service we got and the care taken by all the servers through the event. I most definitely want to come back and try some other dishes on the huge patio they have.

This is not your cheap meal out, but based on our experience it is well worth every bite!"}
{"text":"This was a pretty big disappointment. I've heard really great things about this place but honestly... I'm in no rush to return. Ever. 

Firstly, it's 5 degrees outside today and I think they've decided to open the patio which is totally fine but if I had wanted to sit on the patio I would have (To me, 5 degree is still too cold to sit on a patio). I did not appreciate that they had the window open the entire time I was there so I sat at the bar freezing with the wind blowing on me the entire time. Not impressed. 

The bonus about the Window being open is that when they brought my burger and fries over it turned everything instantly cold so my friend were nice and hard. Yeah, I mean everyone likes cold hard fries right? 

The burger tasted like a Baconator from Wendy's... I don't think it had bacon on it though. So that was cool.... $18 dollars for a greasy chicken burger than tasted like a fast food experiment gone wrong, doused in salt.  

As I said... Not in a rush to return."}
{"text":"The blood burger was excellent 
Also had beet salad with pulled chicken (special request)"}
{"text":"This is a horrible place.
We ordered the tomahawk steak medium rare.
It comes to the table it was removed from the bone and way smaller than described.
The meat was so grisly and chewy we could barely cut it with the steak knife let alone chew it.
We spoke with our server and she returned it to the kitchen.
They told it is chewy served medium rare ? When why the hell would you serve it to us like that ?
So they burned it and gave about half of it back to us ?
Needless to say we didn't eat it or pay for it.
What a terrible experience.
Will definitely not return or recommend.
We went to vintage to actually eat since we didn't eat here and it was amazing !!! 
Don't waste your time with this crap"}
{"text":"We tried out this newish restaurant for Big Taste 2017 lunch and overall I did enjoy it.  The food is basically upscale pub fare.  I must say I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant (gorgeous!!) and the attentive & friendly waitstaff the most!! The food was also good... and on Wednesdays they have half price bottles of wine!! I would definitely go back again for a lunch!!"}
{"text":"Their croque madame does not belng on any menu.  At least they didn't charge us for it.  Cobb salad was enjoyable. Service was underwhelming, and they couldn't make us sangria because they were out of ingredients.  Nice sunny sidewalk table attracted us there....we should have kept walking."}
{"text":"Disastrous! I soo much wanted to make this a regular place for us to go to, but it will not be so.  This is my 5th time here and will be my last.

The Good:
The food. They changed up their menu recently and I really like the new options. Our party of 5 enjoyed the Jacobs ladder rib, the brisket, 8oz steak, and the octopus.  Everything was prepared well and I have no complaints about the kitchen staff or bar staff.  Head Chef Ryan is amazing at what he does and will be a force in the Calgary food scene for years to come.

The Bad:
Management and wait staff. This was a Thursday night, party of five throwing down fairly large amount of money ($600), we were dressed well, and we were treated like shit.  The waiter started out good, was personable, but it slowly dissolved to us feeling like second class diners. He was inattentive and even dismissive at times.  Example: at one point the whole table was out of wine for about 15 min and I had to flag down the manager to get us another round.  another was one of our diners ordered the brisket, was a little surprised that there was no vegetables included, so when it arrived he ordered a side of broccolini.  This arrived 30 min later, when the entire table was finished. the waiter came back a few times and is excuse was that there was a large table that just came in after us taking up his time.  So that's our problem?  They were understaffed for a Christmas season Thursday night? really? 
We finished the night up and again waited for a long time before he even offered a dessert menu, and by this time we have had it.
I typically tip 20%-24%, and would have tonight as well.  But each instance of inattention, rudeness, etc. dropped it another 2%.  I ended up tipping 10%. When the bill came (and that was totally messed up as well) we paid it and I think when he noticed it was only 10% he was very offended and basically threw the receipt down on our table, no thanks for coming, just walked away. The whole party was looking around to each other kind of shocked.  
I spoke to the manager about this disaster before we left and his attitude left a lot to be desired as well. He apologized, shook my hand and said \"come back again, we'll do better next time\" Really, that's it? I'm not expecting a refund on the bill or anything, but some gesture to put weight behind his apology.  You be the judge on what is appropriate, but a meaningless handshake is not enough.
I shouldn't leave a nice dinner out with friends and be so pissed off.

We are planning our wedding in 2017 and this was a serious contender (which I told him as well) and now there is no way we would trust them with our guests.  Out of 5 times here, this is the second time with a very lackluster experience.

Sorry Guild, you lost a big customer."}
{"text":"WTH happened to this restaurant! Went there for a friends birthday at 7pm on a Friday and except for another table of two we were the only ones inside the restaurant until we left at 9:00. 

We both Ordered the beet salad which was ok but felt they were a bit on the soft side didn't seem very fresh. The waitress suggested we let her know when to place the main course to the kitchen because the dishes we ordered could take a while to prepare. So we let her know once our first course was completed. We ordered a lamb shank and a brisket. In 5 minutes voil√† our order arrives overdone and lukewarm, both our meat dry. Obviously they had it sitting under the heat lamps for at least 15-20 min. 

We complain about our food and the waitress offers to buy us dessert. (NOT GOOD ENOUGH) I insist in talking to the manager who should have voluntarily come to speak to us and address our concerns in the first place. He charged us for the bottle of wine we ordered and our mediocre salads. Oh and BTW the Pinot Noir we ordered was room temperature instead of cellared properly and slightly chilled. So I had to order a ice bucket to chill the wine.

If I were the manager at The Guild i would have said that the entire meal is on us, would have provided food vouchers and to please give us another try. Not the case. 

I will never go back. The chefs should be fired!"}
{"text":"Came here myself during summer as my apartment is just a walk away. I had wood grilled squid with a pair of their best wine forgot the name. The wine was pricey but it was okay. Would still come back."}
{"text":"Amazing new place on Stephen Ave!  

It's huge, about 200 outdoor seats, 200 inside and a private room. We were very impressed by the food, sat in the patio and had a beautiful hip of beef.  $12 special and it was fantastic.  

Look for the tomahawk of beef and the pigs head on the menu.  Both look amazing.  

Also they have a full octopus as a meal.  I think the menu is quite good and they did a great job with service.  You can tell the staff was well trained!!

Good luck to the guild!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the look and vibe of this place. It's very cool! The food was also delicious and they have a great selection of drinks and wines. I had the ribs which were fall off the bone good. My table also had the lamb and steak and both were great (we shared an few bites). I'd highly recommend this place for after work gatherings or simply to have a great night on the town. We were travelling from Toronto for work and everyone would come back to this spot in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I showed up this morning at 11:30am for brunch (because the website said it was open for brunch on the weekends at 10am, and the reviews I saw on Yelp indicated that people have indeed been here for brunch), and it was closed! No signs on the door, no information about being closed on the website, no information about being closed on the outgoing voicemail message, and no return phone call.  

In other words, absolutely no effort any kind was made to inform potential customers of being closed.  

Since that part of Dundas West isn't exactly crawling with options (unless you want to wait an hour) it was extremely inconvenient trying to find someplace else quickly.  Unimpressed."}
{"text":"Visited the Guild with friends last night.  It was my second trip there.   Both times we were looked after by the very lovely and capable Sara.  Excellent service.  I love the menu here.  It is very unusual in Calgary, a town full of Earl's and Earl's clones. I had the brisket - you never see brisket on the menu in Calgary.  It was excellent and very tender as brisket should be.  The French fries here are exquisite. If your meal doesn't come with the fries, make sure they come with one of your dining companion's dish so you can mooch.  Otherwise ask Sara to bring you a side.  The wine list is mid range and more than adequate. The ambience is lively.  I highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Quite expensive for the offerings. Drinks were great though, strong and tasty. Had the Frenchie (Quebec chicken poutine) and the octopus appetizer. The poutine was good but was expensive at $22 for fries and gravy. The octopus was a small piece for $15. I think I would rather go to Charcut down the street if I were going to lunch again in this area. The atmosphere was great. I will come back for drinks but food was overpriced for what was served."}
{"text":"stumbled upon a new gem in the Portuguese area, the GUILD with it's contemporary, chic, candle lot, and metallic ceilings is worth the trip, if you're in the area.  This place has only been opened for little over a month, and it definitely looks the part in the urban chic neighborhood.  We decided to come out for a quick bite before heading off, with an order of a pickled asparagus wrapped in ham.  Secondly followed by a fish croquette.  Both were very satisfying, and were delightful. Its always nice to see culinary creativity is still out there!! will definitely be back for a second time to get a better feel for this place.  So far so good!"}
{"text":"OK, I'm a week late on my review. I went there for dinner on Thursday, July 13th....during Stampede. It's a nice restaurant in a great location. I was hoping for so much more. Clearly they were slammed. But don't restaurants want to be busy? Shouldn't they have planned for the crowds during Stampede? My friend and I were seated at the bar, which was OK. But, I think the bartender could have cared less about us. He was busy mixing drinks most of the time. Finally a waiter came over to take our order. The food came out pretty quickly, but it had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for a while (Poutine).  My friend wanted fries with his meal, but they had run out by then - 5:30pm. 

Anyway, I was in Calgary for business, so I probably won't be back. I certainly won't recommend this restaurant though."}
{"text":"I loved it. It is so nice to have another big restaurant, that isnt a chain(not that I dont  love cactus club and earls) but some place that is large and yet very quaint. We were able to get a lovely spot on the patio which is just outside the Hudson Bay- and really, the patio has transformed the area into class and sass from grunge and sketch. My friend and I enjoyed the Pinot Gris special -$6 for 6oz and split the beet salad. and the salmon sandy on soda bread. We were warned that the soda bread was a bit heavy and it was indeed but it was also such a nice flavor (sorta dense molassas flavor). I really liked it but I get that it would be a specific palate. The beets were yum.  I will go back for sure. The inside is way bigger thank you would expect, and I lovvved the retro downstairs bathrooms. So retro 80s from The Bay. Great addition to the 8th ave."}
{"text":"The food was secondary to what I found choice about this joint.

It's located on Stephen Ave in the Hudson Bay Building. It has a street level patio that affords great people-watching and tanning opportunities on a sunny day.  

The interior is beautiful.  The washroom is down flights of stone stairs and made me feel like I was in a Speakeasy.  Why don't all washrooms have large wooden doors that extend all the way to the floor and ceiling??

The fries I had were the perfect crispness and perfectly seasoned.  The pulled pork was meh and a bit greasy...the kim chi slaw surprisingly tame.  My companion's dish was nothing to write home about.  However, the dishes I saw passing by looked amazing, so I reserve the right to revisit.

Very attentive and personable service staff!"}
{"text":"This was excellent.  We were very well cared for, the food was excellent, there was clear, demonstrated concern that we should be fully satisfied and we would willingly go there again"}
{"text":"I was really excited to come here for brunch. The menu looked great, I had great company, and I didn't have to wait for a table ! Parking was a bit cumbersome, that was it. 

Started off with the beignet. The 3 beignets look huge, but it's just airy, not the doughy kind. The chocolate sorbet was light. It was nice. I still think it was missing the raspberry preserves that would have made it taste so much better. I wouldn't order it again. Once is enough. I rather get the sorbets its own. 

My friend ordered the foie gras French toast. Generous portion. Messy looking. He devoured it. The skinny girl beside our table took half of it home. He enjoyed it, but of course not like Norma's in NYC.

I had the butter poached lobster with caviar, benny on blini. Lobster were over-cooked! Their hollandaise sauce had a nice hint of lemon in there. It didn't come altogether for me though. They drenched it too much with the hollandaise sauce. 

Coffee was meh. 

Our server was nice but a bit overly enthusiastic. He would come at all the wrong times to check on us and the food. We either haven't had a chance to take a bite or we were just eating and he would come and we can't talk with our mouths full. it just got a bit too much at the end. He meant well. 

I had to come and try it out. Just not a fan at the moment even though everything sounded delicious. I should try their regular pork belly and eggs, something more traditional. Other wise, I think I would stick with Saving Grace, Federal, and raw bar for now."}
{"text":"Love this Resturaunt.  Another great place in Calgary. The decor is amazing. Has a very cozy feel and yet it's modern classic. The appetizers we tried were very good but not amazing. On presentation I would give it a 5 but in taste it was a 4. The escargot could have used more garlic. And it seemed to have a gritty texture which is of putting to me. The beef tartar we got was too salty. The main course was the lamb leg and the bison. Both get a 5 from me. Taste and texture melted together on each plate in a amazing way. For desert tried the bread pudding and it's one of the best I've had anywhere. Crisp and soft bread with ice Cream. Yum. Also enjoyed their Cesar. Would definitely recommend. Even though we had a ok experience with appetizers(not their norm I think). I'll still say this is a 5 for me because the service, ambience, presentation and taste was amazing."}
{"text":"I couldn't be more terribly disappointed with The Guild. I had high expectations before coming for my first visit, but this place has failed in every regard, in the quality of service and food and overall experience. After giving the restaurant manager an opportunity to make the awful experience right, it's apparent that there's an underlying issue of low quality level management and service staff. Lip service with no action. I was given false information before coming to the restaurant. I phoned the restaurant 3 days before coming, to confirm the reservation, and requested a menu item. I was told that a menu item (roasted pigs head) would be available, for our reserved table for 6, and there was absolutely NO issue that it would not be sold out. This was false as we were told 5 minutes within sitting down it was not available as it was sold out. Our server, Pablo, couldn't have been more unenergetic, passive, and avoidant. He did the bare minimum interaction as he could with our table. A drink was spilt on one of our party, by the server. The mains were not placed at the correct locations, as to who ordered, by the runners. The mains, for a table of 6 did not come out at the same time. When the food main food arrived, and overall the meats were extremely burnt, or cold. Server was MIA when we wanted to order a coffee or dessert. Dim lighting at the table and difficult to read menus. We attempted to let the restaurant take ownership for the failure, and it was thrown back at us as our problem that we did not inform them at the time. I did inform them within a timely manner, and it's  not their perogative to set arbitrary deadlines on feedback. They are aware, and have knowledge of our poor experience, and have choosen to do nothing. It's unfortunate that this place could not do anything to take ownership of poor service and overall food experience. 1 out of 5 stars. Heed this advice and go somewhere else! Charcut, Hy's, Caesars, and many others, just to name a few!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, the service was great and the atmosphere was one of the best I've experienced in Calgary. Highly recommend the lamb shank, the steak tartare and the Korean BBQ. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for our anniversary on the recommendation of some friends. Initially we were blown away by the decor and the ambiance. But that was the peak of our pleasant experience at the guild. The service was half-decent, although I had to remind the young lady to bring my beer - twice. And when she brought it, it was the wrong beer. 

Fast-forward past our forgettable starters, to the completely unappetizing entres. 

I order the Korean ribs with kimchi \"poutine\". What came was overly salted pork ribs which had less of Korean and more of \"preserved for a long voyage in open waters.\" It came with soggy \"hot lamp\" fries with coagulated globules of cheese covered in a bland kimchi knock off sauce. 

My girlfriend ordered the lamb. Which I tried. Like stuffing cotton balls in your mouth. Overcooked, under seasoned, dried morsels of what was left of a lamb leg. The poor thing. 

I hesitantly finished the meal. And my girlfriend convinced me to try the bread pudding. Which I do not regret. Great bred pudding.

Everything else... it needs work."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the lunch I had here. The patio is really quite nice and differentiates itself from the more corporate, hurried venues on Stephen Ave that are totally basic (Earl's, Cactus Club, etc...). They have interesting drink specials and a beautiful venue. Our servers were great. The food was quite yummy, although portions were on the smaller side. I guess that is the downside to eating fancier food...you get less of it. I really liked this place though and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service is lacking for a new place. Walked in and sat in the somewhat empty patio.  No host to be seen. Several employees walked by me and I finally asked for service.  Waiter was rude when I asked for service. Shaking his head and mumbling something. I wasn't having any of that and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Four stars for the best liver, mash, peas and jus I've ever had! My colleague had never had calves liver before and ordered the same as I did, he also loved it. The mushroom soup was also delicious, and not cream based which is rare. 

Nice and quiet but not inattentive on a Monday afternoon, our server was friendly gracious and prompt - another reason for 4 stars. 

Might have to come back before we leave town!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing mixed reviews about this place so I wanted to give it a try.  We got here at 8:30pm on the Halloween weekend for a table for a group of 7 people. They told us it would take about 30 minutes for a table and we can grab a drink at the bar to wait.  We tried a few drinks; moscow mule, caesar and an old fashioned.  The drinks were great and the service at the bar was very good.  It took about an hour to get our table.  We tried a variety of dishes which included: fries, caesar salad, escargot, chicken wings, salmon, beet salad, and onion tart. 

The food was underwhelming for us and very overpriced.  I heard good things about the octopus but they were out of it. The salmon was $29 for a smaller portion than other restaurants and it was bland.  My husbands onion tart was a little too sweet for his liking, I had a bite of the topping and it tasted like dessert.  The appetizers were alright; nothing to rave about.  The fries were alright. The escargot was just buttery; not a lot of flavour. 

I would recommend coming to this place for drinks and the bar snacks.  The food is not worth the wait and the hype. The three stars is based on the drinks and not the food."}
{"text":"The Guild is a good restaurant to go to with friends after work, as it is conveniently located  they have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and good service. In terms of the food, I thought the portions were a bit small and that the food was good but not amazing. I wouldn't go back for the food, I would go back for the ambiance and for their outdoor seating in the summer."}
{"text":"This review is for brunch at The Guild only. If you're looking for a brunch spot, this is not it. We made reservations here for Saturday at 12:45. We were sat down immediately and ordered drinks. Ceasars and mimosas were on special for $5, I think this may have been the only good part of our meal. The drinks came out quickly and we all ordered. There was 5 of us 2 orders of Bacon Benny, Burger, Steak and Eggs and a Croque Madame. It took us over 1 hour to get our meals.  We finally were brought our meals at 2:15. And constantly had to ask to have our water refilled.  

We've been to the Guild for dinner and have always been pleased but brunch here was disappointing. My meal of Bacon Benny came on an English muffin 2 over crispy pieces of bacon and a medium poached egg (if they don't ask how you want your egg I would think they would just make it runny, no?) with barely any hollandaise sauce and some fried potatoes that were unseasoned and dry.  

I'm sure the waitress knew because she didn't even ask us how our meals were after."}
{"text":"This new neighbourhood gem has a promising future from my first visit! An absolutely beautiful space, the Guild is bigger than your average Dundas West haunt with a long gorgeous exposed brick wall, painstakingly crafted ceiling, lovely mirrors, thoughtful table presentations of mossy flowers in jars - a nice twist on the typical flower on the table. Chairs are upholstered with coffee sacks, tables are wooden and warm as is most of the room. 

A good number of tables with a few communal ones as well, this place was bustling on my first visit on Easter Sunday afternoon for brunch. While there was an over-abundance of plaid, beards and funky glasses, don't be swayed by the hipster crowd, what matters here is the food and the food is GREAT. I'd say upscale without being frou-frou - that's a technical term...

I had one of the most delicious lunch meals I've ever had eating out as a vegetarian and I barely know what it was!!! It was a beet pasta with a pesto and red & yellow pepper puree. I am not doing it justice in the description it was a 10 out of 10 for me! My bf had a pork lardon poached egg dish over rice crispies or something like that which he enjoyed but it did leave him hungry after. I think some of the other dishes may have presented him with more food so it might have been a bad order on his part. But he said the food was delicious all the same. Coffee was also a hit, flavourful and the perfect temperature. Not a ton of vegetarian friendly options but the menu is small and I hope, revolving so I can go back and try new things. 

I can't wait to go back for dinner. 

If you're looking for a diner with typical brunch fare, this isn't it. If you want thoughtful food, carefully selected ingredients and a beautiful locale with a price tag to match - this is it."}
{"text":"My hubby and I along with another couple had chosen to dine in at The Guild since we have never been. Located on Stephen Avenue, I must say is a beautiful restaurant creating a beautiful dine in experience. Although, we were thoroughly displeased with the food and the service. We had the meetball appetizer which came out slightly cold. For my main, I had ordered the Chuck burger which had very smoky aftertaste to it. My husband and our friend had orders drinks which sat on the counter for a while before our server decided to bring them over to us, which occurred twice. Once again, gorgeous restaurant, food was ok, a tad bit overpriced..don't think I'd be going back..not for us."}
{"text":"Went here for a business dinner. Great find, food was outstanding. I had the lamb shank which is not the easiest to prepare well and they knocked it out of the park. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I discovered the Guild when a gentleman friend suggested we go there for brunch. This was our first date due to schedules etc. 

I've walked past this place dozens of times thinking the name was the address like some of the \"cool bars\" but it's actually The Guild. I was pleasantly surprised to see how spacious the place was, given the trend is to have tiny bars/restos with minimal seating. We sat down and ordered some hot beverages.

The americano was definitely not the best one I've ever had. No amount of cream/sugar could mask a poorly pulled shot. Plus they serve it in a teeny bowl like glass that is impossible to drink from without spilling the first sip. 

Knowing that coffee is usually not a strong point at most brunch places we ordered our food off a pretty small menu.

I got the bacon and eggs and so did my companion. The service was a bit slow, there's only one chef in the kitchen. So we waited a while and kept chatting away. Our food came and the portion is deceptively small looking which was disappointing initially. Then as I got half way through my meal I realized how much food there actually was.  Not to mention how delicious it was. Let me take a second to call out the sous vide poached eggs that were perfect. The incredible potato and goat cheese croquette . The house smoked bacon which was huge. We skipped the sausages. Only negative is the salad which is mostly cabbage is slimy and not ideal. 

Next thing we realized we had been sitting there for 3 hours chatting away. The space was comfortable and the perfect level of noise. I walked away in a daze from one of the best first dates I've ever been on.

This definitely warranted a return visit and another friend and I tried to go there when it opened at right at 10am. We waited outside for about 15 minutes only to have someone finally come over and say that they were opening at 11 instead. So we decided not to wait. 

A few weeks ago I made another return visit to The Guild. It was delicious, I didn't skip the sausages this time and they were these great little patties that almost overshadowed the bacon which was sadly overcooked. My dining companion got the salmon scramble which looked excellent. I also found that the service was lacking. 

Today I went for a 3rd (4th?) time. I got the salmon scramble which was plated differently then I remembered. Not bad I just expected the eggs and smoked salmon to be scrambled together. The eggs were kinda gross and disappointing but the rest of the meal was excellent. A bit pricey at $15. Plus the americano was not great (as I expected but you know... coffee)

I really want to like this place more but there are a few deltas that need to be fixed. I generally run into at least one person I know so I know it's still popular amongst the hipster brunch types.  I'm going to give dinner a try one of these days.

This place is a 3.5/4."}
{"text":"CLOSED - There is now a Thai restaurant at this address:
http://www.sukhothaifood.ca/contactSukho.html

Very cool venue, very friendly staff. The menu is not at all vegetarian friendly (and definitely not vegan friendly)  but seems like you'll do just fine here as a meat eater. The addition of a few veg items without dairy would be a nice improvement.

I'd go here for an after work drink. They have nice wines and bourbon drinks, so that works for me."}
{"text":"Sitting outside, under an awning, the best thing about this place is people watching! It was Stampede weekend, and the weather was sunny and hot. It's on Stephens, the pedestrian mall.

The food is good enough, the beer was cold. The waitstaff wore a uniform of jeans and plaid shirts. They are attentive, each having a specific task (order taking, drink delivery, food delivery, table clearing - it's a machine!)"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different from the regular mainstream restaurant chains & this place seemed to fit the bill while wandering Stephen Ave. Looks classy from the exterior and inside: still classic but not upscale formal. They had a museum-like artificial display of curing meat & cheese which I'll give props to as unique but also a touch bizarre. Fair warning, vegetarian choices are pretty darn slim here. There are 2 tiers of table seating which helps you to appreciate the scale of the room. It was really hard to appreciate the decor though because it's quite dim inside. It felt like most lighting came from the bar/kitchen area. 
Service was alright, not quick, but not rushed either. Staff were nice as well. We were also regularly refilled on drinks (water & wine) without prompting...There was a half price Wednesday on wine bottles. I appreciate that the server knew what was popular on the menu. It's a smaller menu, but still a lot of options that are vastly different from the next. We considered group sharing platters, but ended up going for individual dinners: steak frites with CO2 Bernaise, ribs & korean poutine, and beef brisket. No regrets on any of those, each were plated well, serving size was decent with strong, robust & different flavours centered around enhancing the meat. Pricing felt fair & reasonable for the experience. 
On a side note: the washroom is an experience of its own... You have to go down 3 flights of stairs in the opposite side of the restaurant which is decorated in bright Victorian style, then at the level of the washroom; it looks like you are walking into a subway/horror house. There's  a super creepy vibe aside from the modern historical decor & modern music overhead. It's incredibly dark & black in the washroom, the bright lighting from the stalls are barely seen with the doors almost touching the ceiling & floor. The solo antique chair with spotlight on it at the entrance gives it a haunting vibe, it's funny how those details is something I'll remember more than the dining experience because it was so disturbing. Would I eat here again? Absolutely! But I would definitely avoid taking a washroom selfie!"}
{"text":"I don't get it!  

We sat on patio, service was pleasant enough.  The menu is small and extremely over priced. After ordering 2 appetizers details to follow.  We find out there is a slightly larger bar menu, not that, that would change this review.   The wine great!  Then we ordered sausage roll and deviled eggs, total of $30 in food.   One sausage roll, yep one.  And let's be honest the meat in the sausage roll is just trim, so a cheap way to use up possible waste. And not even a great one.  The deviled eggs came from midget chickens.  So total bill over $50.   I missed idiot being written on my forehead.  You can count on me not coming back for the $95 strip-loin without sides."}
{"text":"My Guild experience is not as fantastic as some of the reviews here.  Sorry, folks!  My friend and I started off with the Smoked Devilled Eggs.  It came out pretty quick but it went downhill from there.  The 3 small eggs were served halved; no flavor, no smoke, cold.  We had to add more pepper and salt and still, the eggs tasted bland.  Not much thought went into making these eggs and it costs $13!  My friend ordered the Poutine - she hardly ate it and was not impressed with her choice.  I had a small taste of it and it was just ok for me.  I ordered the Pasta of the Day which was the Smoked Trout Mac & Cheese.  This dish was OK for me; it had more seasoning, for sure.  It was piping hot in a skillet.  Our dishes took 30 mins for the food to reach our table.  Wait staff was sporadic.  

Meh, I don't think I'll be back.  I noticed that the food kept getting served to the outside patio first and the tables inside the restaurant were getting their food much slower.  Nice, fancy restaurant on the inside but the chefs really need to beef up their culinary skills to kill it on Stephen Avenue."}
{"text":"The portions were too small in compare with the price and not even tasty. Also beside the bad food your view is the raw pieces of meat and pig's head looking at you. Won't recommend it to anyone unless you want to waste your money."}
{"text":"Oh no! Here I go again . . . .  don't go here when it's busy?!?!?  Strange, but I thought that restaurants wanted to be busy, train their staff to be able to deal with being slammed, but the Guild failed miserably.

What is going on with the restaurants around Calgary. We can't seem to find anywhere that knows how to give good service or make good food lately.  We went to the Guild last week during Stampede, as my wife said they had really great brisket when she was there last summer, so we went. 

The two hostesses that met us at the inside desk seemed incapable of smiling, and were likely assigned to the wrong station. Fortunately our server, Taryn was very pleasant and helpful throughout our meal, in spite of being super busy. The restaurant itself is grandiose, and something to behold, but I was more interested in the food.  

We ordered the brisket in a delicious brioche bun $19, and the chuck burger $18.  We took delivery of a couple of really tasty highballs, that were only $5, while we waited for our lunch.  When lunch arrived the brisket was accompanied by one (one only) huge greasy onion ring.  I didn't like the looks of it, so I didn't try it.  My wife tried a bite, and said it was inedible, greasy, and flavorless.  Glad I skipped it :)  The brisket was good, but I wasn't a fan of the sweet sauce that it was drizzled with, my better half really loved it. What I really didn't like about the brisket was the tiny amount of meat that was in the bun for $19.  Ridiculous; we mentioned the lack of meat to our server, and she immediately acknowledged that there should have been more brisket, so she offered to remove the item from our bill.

We then tied into the burger, or at least were were going to. . . one look at it and we found that it was so pink and red (med rare or rare) in the middle of both thin patties that we did not attempt to eat it. We again brought this to the attention of our server, and she was horrified and apologized repeatedly, citing that the kitchen was really slammed with the Stampede lunch rush.  At this point we didn't really want another burger. The manager appeared after a couple of minutes, and also apologized, and said he would take care of the bill, if we would just pay for our drinks.  He also said he would comp us a single desert to share.   Share . . . Really?  Anyway, we took the desert which was small piece of carrot cake with a small scoop of ice cream.  It was probably the best part of the meal.

Sorry for the run on fingers, we may try it again on a slow day.

Cheers"}
{"text":"The service and food here is absolute garbage. Came here in the afternoon for a late lunch and ordered the following: 
- Smoked deviled eggs 
- Smoked Salmon Ni√ßoise salad
- Fried calamari
- Octopus salad 
- Mushroom soup

All of these dishes were horrible. Also, do the chefs even taste what they make? Everything was overly salty -- to the point where I was chugging 5 glasses of water just to finish a bite. Our server was no better, she never smiled and was quite condescending. 

It's sad because the interior is gorgeous, but everything else here is shit."}
