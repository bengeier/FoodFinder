{"text":"I don't know why the reviews for Armando's are so poor. I'm not a big gourmet dinner, but the food is fresh and home made. If you want fancy, go somewhere fancy and pay $100 per person for dinner. Me and my daughter ate here for around $50. I had purchased a deal find coupon so really it was dirt cheap. Nothing to complain about. The food was good, my daughter loved the gnocchi, I had the sea bass and it was quite good. The star rating is relative. I would give any organic raw food bar 5 stars that's why Armando's only gets 3 from me, but if I was comparing it to any chain place, this would be a 5 star next to Boston pizza(0.5 star), Kelsey's(1.5 stars) for example. Armando and our waitress were super nice and friendly. I would highly recommend this place for a quiet nice meal. Again, I am no expert, but the coffee was really good."}
{"text":"I went here today with two of my friends and we ordered 3 different meals.

The ambiance is great and has a lot of character. They write neat little messages on all meals served.

The place is kind of expensive I ordered spegetti and it was $15, a beer was $5, and it wasn't all that great, I haven't had a lot of italian food but I have definitely had better.

Very limited vegetarian/vegan options, but they will change the dish to suit your needs so that was nice, and I got a 30% off coupon so I might go back to give it one more try and if the food gets any better I will update this post."}
{"text":"This is the second post i have delivered on this site. The first post i gave a excellent review. A couple of months ago. I went back on this site to look at the reviews again on the restaurant. Where did my review go. It seems like there is just bad posts. Seems like someone is really disliking this restaurant at yelp.
Whatever the case the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Made the mistake of reading these reviews after we already ordered.

Caprese salad, suprisingly came with the but end of the tomato.

Strachetella soup was watered down.

Pasta was just ok, tasted more out of a can.

Sausage dish was terrible and the vegetables were even worse. Non fresh vegetables on a bed of yellow lettuce.

Sad to report this, but hopefully they read and learn from all of these bad reviews."}
{"text":"OMG!  What a joke this place is.  Went on Mothers day but couldn't use my coupon..and there were only 2 other tables the whole time i was there.(but fair enough - fine print did say no Mothers day - but c'mon..build some business!).  

No anti pasto offered for an appetizer.  I asked if they could pull something together.. a few sliced meats, cheeses, peppers etc...give me a price... \"No CAN DO\"!!
No bread or roles or olives to offer us either ...when pushed (twice) to bring some to go with the \"drain trap\" minestrone - all they could muster was the stale baguette slces they use for making bruschetta (no joke - HARD BREAD)  I asked for some butter - NO CAN DO!.  3 different main dishes and all with the same \"canned\" sauce base..you could actually taste the tin. I asked for a fettucine in any kind of a white sauce (off the menu) - NO CAN DO.  Had to go for the spag carbonara (scrampled egg spaghetti at best!) 

All froxen desserts and had freezer burn and no presentation. Although only 3 tables for the night I had to pile soup dishes and drink cans to the side - my wife was laughing and sole entertainmnet was how big pile would get before waitress noticed. (she cleared it with the bill drop)
without a doubt - the saddest meal ever.  Definitely a deliberate tax loss for someone.
Only commenting now as I found my unused coupon.  Will find someone homeless or wanting  on Yonge Sheppard to donate."}
{"text":"-1 stars. 
The worst service I ever had. I had to constantly wait for my server for service and he had a major attitude problem. Maybe it's because I look young and therefore he didn't treat my friends and I with any respect (we used a groupon service as well).
The food was nothing to talk about.
It was one my worst experiences ever. I'm sad to write this review, but I had to let people know about the bad service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"this place is disgusting old frozen food heated back up by the microwave. I will NEVER come back here. started with the bruschetta and it was 2 small pieces of bread with tomatoes and cheap cheese toasted on top.  Didn't even come out hot and we were the ONLY table at the restaurant.  

 I had the lasagna for my main and you can taste the freezer burn and the veggies in it were GROSS.  Even the cheese was cheap and nasty.  just CHEAP food and I can have a better meal going to loblaws and buying a frozen tv dinner.  This place should be closed down."}
{"text":"I've been living in the area for almost a year now and always wanted to try out Armando's despite the opposing reviews.

Bad idea.

The food was disgusting! The food had obviously been frozen as it looked and tasted worse than microwavable frozen meals. The meat was so hard to cut and chew. Now that I think about it, it was probably expired too.

We were the only ones in the restaurant - not surprised.

The only thing decent was the decor and waitress.

Can't believe they charge sooo much for disgusting food. 

Each dish averages around $20. If they had a sale for $1 a dish, I wouldn't even buy it, not even to feed a dog!

Save your money and go to the food court. Better yet, buy some frozen food - tastes better!

So disappointed - they should just close down! I think they should be on Kitchen Nightmares with Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"I came on a Saturday evening with my partner.  We were promptly seated.

All servers were very nice.  

We ordered the shrimp appetizer, caesar salad, home made ravioli in a white sauce, veal parmesan, and a tiramisu.

The shrimp appetizer was miserable.  They were a tiny 8 limp shrimps (like those you get in a shrimp ring) laid on a bed of leafy spines.  I couldn't believe they could pass this off as an appetizer at an \"authentic\" Italian restaurant.

The ravioli in the cream sauce was the most pleasing.  The caesar salad was also a full bed of romaine heart spines with little sauce.  It tasted like iceberg lettuce.

This place was very dissapointing.  Ambiance is nothing to write home about.  Though the service was good."}
{"text":"This restaurant was formerly called Tony's.  I liked Tony's, I'm not sure why they closed down, though I had my suspicions.  Armando's has basically kept the same layout as Tony's, it's just a little sleekier.  

If I had to draw a comparison, Tony's had a traditional mom and pap feel to it, and Armando's looks like they cater to the business crowd. i tried the gnocchi with a simple tomato sauce. It was pretty expensive, around $14 for a lunchsize portion.  There wasn't anything to cry home about to be honest. The gnocchi was cooked nicely, but the sauce was simple and didn't have that much flavor. I loaded it with hot pepper flakes and cheese... 

Good place for a lunch meeting, but maybe all they would be good for."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been here but the food is still great. I have the spaghetti, fresh & tasty. Service is very friendly. The chef/owner is always there,  working hard to please his guests. Nice affordable place."}
{"text":"Armando's is in an area packed with lots of small independents and franchise restaurants. The diversity of cuisine and price points nearby offers up stiff competition. So what does Armando's have to offer that might entice you? I caught them on TeamBuy and the deal was just too good to resist, so I bought three of them for my own use! I must share my experiences with you.

First the pros: Getting there couldn't be easier, they're about 20 meters from the Sheppard subway stop and 50 meters from public parking lots that always have a spot available. Inside, the decor is very nice and classy, I enjoyed the mosaic and the ambiance was just lovely. Service has always been very prompt. I regret that everything aside from the ambiance and prompt service is absolutely horrific. 

Cons: The menu doesn't offer anything inventive or that I haven't had at many other restaurants and wedding halls, but I guess going traditional isn't bad in and of itself, as long as it is good! The food is so bad!!!! and I really am not one to complain. The pasta: noodles are cooked to al mush and the sauce tastes it definitely came out of a can. The red sauces are all gross and sweet and the white sauce was starchy and bland. I ordered my arrosto di manzo medium rare and it came, no lies, extra well done. Upon complaining, i was told that is the only way it is served despite the server confirming my request for med rare. The sauce did not salvage anything and i had a sore jaw the next day from chewing that hockey puck. The pizza was sort of like a crispy frozen flatbread with more sweet canned sauce, I was very disturbed. Dr. Oetker's pizzas are vastly superior. Given I had three meals with a guest, we did try many more items, but I'm afraid it's all the same as above. The desserts also taste like store-bought frozen grocery store fare, with a drizzle of sauce and highly inflated price. 

If you've read this, I apologize for the negativity, but I want everyone to know that this place should be avoided like hot lava. I paid half price for all my meals here given the group buys, and if I had the opportunity to buy more at 80% off, I would not! So, if you are in the area, eat anywhere but here. Only go here for a drink, the food is just that bad, the worst restaurant food I've ever eaten, and the prices are really a joke.

{"text":"Went there to eat last night.  I found the wine okay, but the food.  Let's just say not much of a selection.  I had their Tortelleni, and that is the only pasta they had with a white sauce.  I was very disappointed.  I ended up just paying my bill and walking to Pizza pizza for a slice."}
{"text":"2.5 star

Armando's always look empty doesn't matter when I walked by, drove by... And with the low rating from Yelp, I would probably would not be coming here if not for the Teambuy coupon...

The interior is nicely decorated with a Tuscany countryside feel... pretentiously rustic... 

The lone waitress was nice and welcoming.. and we received excellent service.

Caesar Salad ($6.50)
- Fresh and crispy... A-OK

Linguine Alla Pescatore ($18) - fresh shrimp, scallops, & mussels with linguine pasta, tossed in a light spicy tomato sauce
Shrimp Penne Arrabiata ($10) - fresh shrimps and penne tossed in a very spicy tomato sauce
- I found the fault is in the sauce... it just tasted canned... and really Americanized/Canadianized... just not really Italian Authentic
- Portion wise for the Linguine Alla Pescatore is pretty small... may I suggest Armando's use a bigger plate and improve on the presentation
 
Tiramisu ($6)
- MEH!! MEH!! Not worth my calories and my while.... supermarket version and with supermarket quality to match

Cafe Latte ($3)
- really really light roast, my dinner mate likes that.. 

I feel for Armando's!  But they really lacking something to make it worth my money and time to come and eat here and pay full price for the experience.

SKIP!!"}
