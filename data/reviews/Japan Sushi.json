{"text":"I've been coming to Japan sushi since I moved to the Annex a few years ago - of all of the sushi places on that strip between Bathurst and Spadina, it is up there with the best.   Extremely friendly service, fresh fish, good quality food (great tempura!) and an extensive and inexpensive lunch menu (7-10$ or so). The only reason my review didn't include a five star rating is that I have been brought the wrong order on two or three occasions - but they're always very gracious and offer to replace it, always bringing a little extra to apologize. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for for good noms on the annex \"sushi strip\"."}
{"text":"Delicious food, generous portions, good prices, professional service, calm atmosphere.  The most reliable sushi place I've encountered in Toronto.  Always good.  Have been going there for years.  Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"There was a giant caterpillar in my salad... Need I say more!?  Well, their explanation was that it's \"organic\". It was the size and length of my pinky. If you cleaned your veggies at all, it should have come off or at least died! Restaurant is cheap for sure. You get value of 8 rolls instead of 6. But I guess that comes with a side of bug."}
{"text":"The atmosphere leaves me wanting, but the great vegetarian options (veggie sushi combo!) bring me back. and those noodles they always give as an appetizer. and the booths are not too bad."}
{"text":"Price: Quite cheap   Rolls: Delicious!! Sushi: no. just no. Miso soup and salad that began the meal was a failure which quickly diminished our appetite. So if you ever want a cheap lunch that doesn't include sashimi or sushi, it's a great place to be! However, if you are looking for fresh fish, try somewhere else!"}
{"text":"This place is my favourite one when I'm up for sushi. It is never too crowded, the interior is welcoming, and prices make you think about one more portion."}
{"text":"I didn't mind the food for Japan Sushi.  For budget fare, it is decent. The bathroom needs improvement.  To access it, you have to walk through a hall past the kitchen.  Boxes are stacked up against the walls and there is a heavy fish smell.    I really enjoyed the Bibimbap.  The Salmon sashimi was enjoyable (even though the pieces are cut small). I would have enjoyed the miso soup more if they put tofu inside.  I would recommend the restaurant to anyone that would like a quick meal in the Annex."}
{"text":"Pretty good prices here but I have to give it only two stars because we ordered green dragon rolls and though the portions are generous and there was lots of avocado on top, the avocado was unfortunately frozen. First time I've ever experienced frozen avocado on my maki!   Service not that great - the server seemed annoyed to bring us water.  The booth we were in was slightly broken and shabby."}
{"text":"With so many sushi places on Bloor Street, it's sometimes difficult to decide on which restaurant to eat at.  Also, we wanted to avoid the AYCE (all you can eat) restaurants and go to an authentic Japanese restaurant with fresh quality fish, so we happened upon Japan Sushi which had great reviews on Yelp.  Surprisingly neither of us has yet to visit here, so we were ready to try something new and the prices really attracted us to this location as well plus no lineups.  The interior was charming and reminded me of a traditional Japanese restaurant. Staff were friendly and very welcoming and were usually available when needed.  We ordered the sushi boat B which was under $30 and fed two people nicely.  The boat came with salad, miso soup, japchae (noodles), mixed tempura appetizer, edamame, and choice of ice cream.  The salad had a nice light dressing; miso soup was flavourful and served hot with enoki mushrooms; japchae was a little bland tasting, but edible; tempura was lightly battered and crispy; edamame cooked al dente and lightly seasoned; ice cream choice of green tea or mango (cannot go wrong with either choices).  The food arrived timely and we weren't left waiting and wondering when the next course would arrive.  Plus tea was replenished often even though we had ordered beer.  For the price and reasonably fresh sushi (don't think it was the highest grade fish served), Japan Sushi was quite tasty and enjoyable, perhaps I was quite hungry because I could have had more sushi.  My only complaint was the rice on the sushi wasn't firm and fell apart easily (and yes I dipped the fish side down into the soy sauce).  Any sushi place that doesn't get me sick is okay in my books and I would probably try this place again. Unfortunately, my friend was not so lucky and had the runs shortly after eating here."}
{"text":"Japan Sushi is by far the best sushi restaurant on Bloor, hands down. Miso soup, yam noodles, and green tea come free with all meals. The sushi rolls are delicious and generous. In particular, the Veggie Queen roll and the Boston and Chicago rolls are unreal. The staff are all incredibly sweet and friendly and treat their customers like their own. Looks like a bit of a hole in the wall but the food and the people make up for it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you are looking for affordable, fresh sushi on the annex, this is the place to go.  They have amazing lunch specials & the service is good."}
{"text":"I love it here. I usually come here for the Korean dishes since not too many Korean places have vegetarian options. I love the vegetable and tofu bim bap. It was so good. I also had the chap jae which was prepared really well. It wasn't greasy and it had a nice sesame flavour. The service was friendly and quick as well. The prices are very decent considering that you get a lot of food for your money. This place is definitely on my coming back list. I cannot think of a reason not to love this place. It is amazing here."}
{"text":"As most of the reviews on here suggest- Yes this is on Bloor Street and Yes it is over crowded with other sushi joints. So why choose Japan Sushi? Well It's quaint and quiet and is a good spot to get a quick bento lunch. Yes I'm sure it's not the top notch sushi place you may be looking for but if you're hungry and want to be plenty full for under 10 bucks then I say pick this place.   Also you can customize most boxes incase you have allergies or dietary restrictions. Mega points up there friends!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking for a place to eat on a Saturday night (it was around 7) and for some reason, all the Japanese restaurants were fully booked except THIS one. Of course, our group then questioned the quality of the restaurant because it was nearly empty, but thanks to Yelp's decent rating, we / (I?) decided to check it out.   The place is OK. I thought it was crazy cheap. I got a golden dragon roll for only $8.95. The dragon roll comes with miso soup (the miso soup actually tasted disgusting. Quite like water with 2 strands of enoki mushrooms???) and japchae (undercooked and way too hard). But overall, the golden dragon roll was extremely delicious, filling, and cheap. I was surprised at the quality of the roll given the terrible, but freebee soup and japchae.   If you're thinking about getting sushi and all your favorite sushi restaurants on Bloor are full, check this place out. It might surprise you. I would not really suggest anything else but their rolls."}
{"text":"Rather than try to stuff hungry patrons with over-riced morsels, like the rest of the sushi restaurants on Bloor Street, Japan Sushi has maintained its dignity.  With a slightly smaller menu than Sushi on Bloor and New Generation, it focuses on the star of the show - the fish.  Let me explain:  if you ordered a set sushi meal at one of the other spots, you'd get something like a piece of Tuna, a piece of Salmon, a piece of fake crab meat and a clam.  Two of those are clearly filler (am I the only one who things that the clams at sushi places taste like the erasers we used to use in kindergarten?  Yup, I put those in my mouth, too).  Bamboo sushi at Japan Sushi, on the other hand, will come with two salmons, a tuna, a tai and a piece of melt-in-your-mouth white tuna.  See what I mean?  They are more generous and the fish I've had has always been excellent and fresh.  The Chirashi is especially good here.  Rice is also balanced and tasty, rather than thick, sticky and flavourless as can so often be the case in cheaper sushi places.  Skip the line-ups at those other places and come to Japan Sushi.  It's much better.  Vegetarian score: 5/10.  This is the one down-fall - the veggie options are less interesting here than some other spots on the sushi strip.  It really is a fish-lovers' paradise."}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me that a little hole-in-the-wall Japanese place on Bloor would actually blow me away, and they were totally right! I mean, the place is a bit small and not the best looking, and the physical menus are totally worn out and could really use an upgrade, but the sushi rolls were amazing! The largest I have seen anywhere in Toronto, I think. And you get 10+ pieces in each speciality roll instead of the typical 6-8. Great value!! My only criticism was that my roll could have been wrapped a bit tighter, as it fell apart in my chopsticks and I had to eat it with my fingers. But that really didn't bother me since it was delicious.  The food was great, but it was really the service that totally blew me away. Free soup, salad, and some sort of noodle appetizer (nice touch!) for everyone, and when I asked the waitress about what kind of tea they served (thought it was some kind of brown rice tea), she tried to explain but there was a bit of language barrier so I didn't think I would find out. But then she came bad a few minutes later and gave me a handful of tea packets for free, and then came back again later with a piece of paper with \"barley tea\" written on it (I'm assuming someone in the back translated and wrote it down for her). That was so nice of her!! Way to make a customer feel appreciated!! I can't wait to go back again and try some more giant rolls."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an older look, but was comfortable enough. They had a tiny patio which we were able to enjoy.   We ordered a big variety of things from sashimi and sushi to edamame and tempura. We also got some avocado rolls because I don't do the fish (cooked or raw). Everything tasted great and looked good. It wasn't the most artistic presentation, but this wasn't that kind of place and I am really fine with that. It felt perfect for the moment and the environment.  The service was great! He was patient with us figuring things out (there were disagreements since our group had widely-varying taste). Everything came out very fast, and it was good.   This was cheap, good, and fast. It is all three of the things you never thought you could get at once.   While I have only been once so far, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"when Sushi on Bloor is packed over and above just cross the street and you'll end up in this small quiet sushi place.  I liked the decorations (red couch seats and benches, traditional cutlery on the displays, guestbooks at each table) and the atmosphere (quiet with a soft background music that doesn't disturb talking).  I didn't like that they have just very few veg options (no veg bento boxes... at least none at the non lunch time)...   but otherwise a cute sushi place one of many along bloor in the annex."}
{"text":"The place is a bit run down and dark but the servers are very friendly. The menu is huge, and I like they had a separate vegetarian section. There are plenty of combos to choose from. The prices are great. The food tasted like any other sushi restaurant. The green salad was quite watery though."}
{"text":"Good food for good price ... Customer service is excellent ... They gave us fee dumplings for being regular ... Sweet"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here to eat earlier this week and we had a terrible experience. They served us spoilt sashimi. My boyfriend ate a piece and it tasted terrible. After smelling a second piece of the same fish, we realized the fish had gone bad. When we told our waitress, who then told the sushi chef, they offered to give us a different type of sashimi, but by then we were too disgusted to want to continue eating. They did not apologize or offer to give us a discount on our meal. We were really disappointed by both the food and how they handled the situation. We will never return here again."}
{"text":"I went here this weekend (june 27).  the food was super affordable and the washrooms was clean.  i would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place, from when I was living downtown for three years!  Service is extremely friendly and pretty quick; portions are great. My favourite rolls are the red dragon roll and rainbow roll. The salmon sushi combo is great; very fresh and a good balance of salmon and rice for sushi pieces!   The agedashi tofu is an amazing appetizer. I also really like how they serve a salad and cold noodle appetizer with some orders on the menu.   The only things I would change: the miso soup is too salty, and I'm not a huge fan of the tea they serve (I think it's brown rice tea).  Overall, still the best sushi place in downtown Toronto - so far!"}
{"text":"Sushi on bloor was too busy and packed and we were starving so we walked around and saw this place was empty.   The food tasted okay. The spring rolls were good, the hot pot filled with rice, veggies and other stuff tasted okay. i prolly couldve made the same thing at home better....and my friend got beer strips or whatever it was called and he said it tasted like campbells pre made sauce LOL i cant judge his food because i dont eat meat but ya the restaurant is good to keep you full for a few hours but dont expect delish food. damn sushi on bloor..always too busy!"}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars  Chicken teriyaki was good. California rolls were average in terms of taste. The rolls themselves appear to be sloppily made however. Then again, Japan Sushi is a more of a place for to stop by and have something to fill you up rather than admire the presentation of their food. There seems to be a shortage in staff since the place was packed and all the staff members were rushing to attend to the patrons. This shows that they care about their customers, which already makes them stand out amongst the other sushi restaurants in the Annex."}
{"text":"Two other reviews?  For SHAME, Toronto!  Are you truly such a nation of hustle and bustlers that you can't slow down for a moment to sniff the soy sauce?  My sister and I discovered JapSu during one fated evening while we once again stood in the freezing cold in the line to get into Sushi on Bloor.  Why martyr ourselves, we figured, when we could just as easily go across the street for sushi on Bloor regardless?  JapSu was clean, empty, welcoming, not entirely un-desperate for our patronage, and we were thusly treated like queens.  The food is delicious - for the same flat fee as any sushi-on-Bloor experience, you get soup and salad (although the soup is actually a little bland and watery, the acidic bite in the fresher-than-Sushi on Bloor-salad dressing is a more-than-fair exchange), a little dish of sesame-oiled glass noodles that I still dream about regularly, and a sushi combo: gorgeous, thick sashimi, small but fresh maki, easy avocado substitutions, no filler crap like imitation crab, food that arrives on an effing BOAT, and...  *FANFARE*  ...White Tuna.  The greatest invention ever.  Creamy, sweet, savory, slightly oily, mouthwatering, salmon-eclipsing, booking-a-flight-on-Porter-Air-as-we-speak white tuna.  OMFG.  I would kill you and your loved ones for a piece right now, and it's 9:13am.  They also have a bit of a Korean specialty, so all your bi bim bap needs will be authentically met.  Charming Anecdote: Our waitress was a total doll and, without being reminded, always knew our substitutions and my sister's food allergies.  One evening, midway through our Bamboo Sushis, we decided that it would be nice to bring her some sort of little gift.  We started tossing around ideas that eventually devolved into deciding that we should plant a tree in Israel to her honor.  Our hysteria at this theoretical idea resulted in an actual snarfing of wasabi-laden soy sauce, and our sweet waitress was there with napkins in record time."}
{"text":"Japan Sushi gets my business when the queues at Sushi on Bloor are too long and I am in a hurry to eat (it's right across the street). You'll get NO line ups here, the place is usually half full at most.   Not sure why because it's pretty decent. I really like their Bento box lunch specials. You can get some basic ones for $5.99-$6.99, then they offer a whole bunch of \"extras\" that can be added for $1.   The bentos here are not copiously huge portions, but they come with a wider variety of foods and you get a real california roll rather than just a couple of the shitty cucumber roll pieces.  They also do some great sushi boats which are good if you have 2-3 people. Fairly cheap."}
{"text":"Japan Sushi is one of my favourite sushi joints on that strip of Bloor (between Spadina and Bathurst).   It's a quiet little restaurant and is never very busy. Their lunch deals are quite good. You get a lot of food with those bento boxes! Teriyaki (beef, chicken, salmon, vegetable, gyoza - your pick), rice, salad, miso, appetizer, six pieces of yam tempura, six pieces of California Roll...all for $6.99 or so.   It's a great option if you're looking for cheap, decent sushi along Bloor.   Service has always been quite good. Friendly staff.   There is a cute little patio that opens up in the summer (and still operates as a closed patio during the winter)."}
{"text":"I have been to Japan Sushi a number of times but only recently returned to this establishment. It is one of the quieter restos in the Annex sushi circuit. The little outdoor seating in the front provides a couple cute tables that add some character and set a more chillaxed vibe as you walk in off Bloor. The food prices are very reasonable and competitive with the other options nearby. They offer a large variety of typical Japanese restaurant foods as well as few different combination possibilities. It seems that their huge 10pc special rolls are most popular and rightfully so. The appetizers and maki are pretty standard however they do include Korean hot foods like bibimbap inside their \"well used\" menus. Bonus points for the kind and attentive service. The special rolls were all great at around $9, but overall fish quality was mediocre, the salad to start was too vinegary, the Miso was watered down, and the rice was hard. Overall, I like the variety of the menu and the price is great however quality was under that of say New Gen or Sushi on Bloor."}
{"text":"There are so many sushi restaurants in Toronto, including a half dozen choices within two blocks of this place. We came here to branch out because we'd had Sushi on Bloor just recently. We both ended up with bento boxes. The food was ok, but great and not as good as sushi on bloor. Still, not a bad spot for a quick cheap meal, it's just not a stand out and there are so many other options around."}
{"text":"The sashimi here was poorly cut and kind of gross. The miso soup tasted like it was made with dirty stale tap water, and it was very watered down. I dont understand how you mess up sashimi. Maybe if was the really poor cutting job where it was all in awkward sized pieces and weird shapes. I couldn't finish my plate bc the sashimi was just gross. No wonder there was no line here while New Generation and Sushi on Bloor had lines spilling on the street. Next time wait it line bc this place was horrible."}
{"text":"One of the better Sushi joints in the Annex, but it doesn't seem to be very popular. Big on taste, and portions. I had the Golden Dragon Roll, and it was delicious! Great ambiance too :)"}
{"text":"I always do take outs at this place so my review is based on that.   I always drop by and get greeted by an employee with a huge smile and how's it going. I think they're also quite friendly to me because I'm always there. Sometimes they give me extra items which is always nice. Anyways, place and order and pay, return 20 minutes later and it's ready."}
{"text":"I like that the ratio of rice to ingredients is lower than other sushi places.  My friend and I had the sunshine roll, soft shell crab, and katsu don with some hot sake.  They gave us some edamame as a service, which was a nice gesture.  The food was not bad and the portion was good for its price.  The restaurant and the menu look a little dated, but they have good service and great selection of food."}
{"text":"Amazing little hidden gem in the heart of downtown. Been coming here for years, yet never had the proper chance to write my review. If you want proper sushi, with a real Japanese chef, who won't cheap out on ingredients or quality, you're in the right place. Not to mention the staff always treat customers with kindness, whether it is your first time or if you are a regular.  The value for what you can get it amazing, $30 with dozens of rolls, sashimi, and signature rolls, not to mention complimentary tea, soup and salad! If you are a sushi lover and are looking for great service, friendly environment, and an affordable menu, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in the Annex. service and food are always quality. They have a patio but limited spaces. The wooden exterior may be a little old fashion but I feel it brings a more comfortable setting. Try the sushi and the free jap chae appetizer. I recommend this place to my friends."}
