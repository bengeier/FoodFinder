{"text":"Great, fried goodness! Had the margarita pizza which was delicious. Only complaint would be that the dough was really soggy and would droop as you held the pizza, kind of making it difficult to eat. The folding technique needed to be used ;) The fried platter was amazing. Especially the arancini and meatballs! Beer and wine were $4 each, can't go wrong with that.

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good beer and friendly staff.  However, the frito misto came out cold and disappointing :(  how long does it take to deep fry battered seafood?  Not long at all. Plus, I wouldn't mind waiting a bit for steaming, hot, and crispy frito misto."}
{"text":"The pizza here is incredible, and the pint at 4$ each can't be beat, best pizza place I have been to yet"}
{"text":"We always order the diavola pizza and it is consistently delicious. Specifically the crust is made just right. It's perfectly charred in the wood fired oven. Sauce is very tasty with a hint of spice. And the toppings are high quality and match well. We have always found the service friendly. This is not a sit down dinner place. You order at the front and sit down with a number. The food comes super fast. Good value for the price. The decor works really well and provides a warm eating environment."}
{"text":"I ordered through Uber Eats and the food was quite good. I especially liked the pizza crust. I'll be definitely trying it out in person in the near future!"}
{"text":"This place offers traditional Italian products but it has kitchen problems. The stuffed pizza was only half stuffed and the meatballs were raw on the inside. I overheard another table complaining about the same. Service was average and prices reasonable, fast food concept a lil weird."}
{"text":"This place full of pleasant surprises! Hidden patio in the back, laid-back self service, amazing pizza, affordable prices - can't wait to come back and try more on the menu."}
{"text":"There is no contact info on your website - no email or phone number. How/who do I contact about an issue I had at a3 Napoli the evening of Friday 06/19. Thank you."}
{"text":"Went to A3 Napoli last night. We were really looking forward to it due to the great reviews on Yelp & elsewhere.  Sadly we were very disappointed. Ordered the diavolo & margarita pies. Both arrived horribly soggy, it was like mush.  One could not differentiate from the brown paper liner & the pizza. Even the outer crust was rather soft. When we brought them up to the counter the young lady asked if we wanted to take them home. I told her that they were horrible & asked why they were so soggy she said \"yeah, sometimes the oven malfunctions & that's what happens\".  Then tossed them out and said, sorry. That was it. No offer to make again or give us our money back. I would have given just one star if not for the special salad which was delicious, the one saving grace of the evening."}
{"text":"This is a 5 stars for quality/price. Some of the deep fried stuff was not maximally crispy, and the pizza (Porchetta and pistachio with honey) was a bit on the nose. That said: everything was delicious and so so so so so reasonably priced. Service was delightful. I'll be back and I hope they can find their feet in terms of audience/consistency of the food. This is such a good idea---for those of us who love neapolitan food."}
{"text":"Libretto pizza. Without all the restaurant frills. 

Delicious. Patio is nice. Relaxed and casual."}
{"text":"Love this concept. I'm always on the go visiting clients, delivering, meetings here there everywhere and A3 delivers hot fresh (tasty) food fast. 

Good pricing, friendly staff and delicious. Awesome for a quick bite or hang out on the patio."}
{"text":"Awesome Neapolitan style (thin, chewy crust) pizza at a great price. Menu minimalist and perfect. Popped in for an 8 dollar, generous size personal pizza and a 4 dollar glass of wine. Great spot and nearby The Royal and other fun spots, so makes for a great dinner before an event.
Found it via some fancy googling and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Food, prices and service were all wonderful. Only thing missing is more drink selection. The place has a vibe similar to libretto, which I found it out coincidentally is part of the same group. Definitely will come here again."}
{"text":"Omg amazing dark lager, craft beer side launch brewing company!!
This place is great, awesome service, they ask many times how you liking the food etc
Pizzas are small but very fresh! The sauce is very tasty
Clean atmosphere
Had the land platter for app, it was light but good, cauliflower fried, meatballs, and fresh fried mozerellaa 
Food came very fast as well
You have to pay first then go sit down"}
{"text":"I'm torn by this review...I thought the pizza was good and I liked their menu. The ingredients seemed fresh however....the service....2 thumbs waayy down! We ordered our pizza to go but the girl that took our ordered acted like we were such an inconvenience. Waiting for the receipt to come out of the machine while paying, she walked away before the transaction was even completed.. We also requested chili sauce and when opening my pizza, the chili sauce was placed upside down inside the box and the sauce was no longer in the container but rather saturated a corner of one of my pizza slices. 

So, with that, I'm sticking with my 3 stars!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely my new pizza watering hole. I've been meaning to give this place a try and thanks to BlogTo I checked it out today. 


$4 beers? $8 margarita pizza? Yes please."}
{"text":"Wow! So good. This is a spin off, little brother, brainchild of libretto and its so great. More casual and less opinions although I actually like the pizza at A3 more! It's a bit more 'rustic' than libretto in the sense that it's not as paper thin. We like that since its not to thin and wet like some of the really really thin pizzas can get. The oven is gorgeous and cooks the pizza very quick and evenly. A3 staff is nice and very knowledgable. I would hands down recommend going here! They also have beer and wine. Enjoy the Za!"}
{"text":"Came here soon after opening and had a great margherita pizza. Tomatoes were sweet, basil was fresh, and it may have been the best value pizza I've had in the city. A year later, and the same pizza had that sour, tinned tomato taste, and was floppy and unremarkable. A real shame. It was so good! And now, for the pizza anyway, it just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"When it was announced that A3 Napoli was going to be offering a pizza in collaboration with Porchetta & Co, I know that I'd be there sooner or later.

We started out with the special Il Fritto, which was fried cauliflower atop a couple of tasty sauces. This was definitely a decent dish, but for some reason it wasn't even a little hot when it arrived to the table. The breading wasn't terribly crispy, either, so I would say this wasn't exactly the best way to start the meal.

But then the Porchetta & Co pizza arrived. Topped with porchetta, bechamel, Provola, pear, sage, pistachio, honey, and crackling, the pie was nothing short of delicious. All the ingredients worked beautifully together - even the pear! - although I will admit that I would have never guessed the porchetta connection had I not known. (It probably didn't help that the cook seemed to have forgotten the crackling.)

I'll note also that we were there at noon on a Sunday and were the only people in there the whole time. It's surprising because the food is really, really good."}
{"text":"Really nice spot. The service is great,  really friendly and efficient.  The pizzas were great.  Soft and thin crust.  

The mailolina was very good.  Very tasty.  The diavola was good too,  with some heat.  We also got the Margherita and one with pepperoni,  I don't try them but they were apparently good.  

We also had the cinnamon doughnuts for dessert,  which were very good.

So a great spot.  In fact I like the fact it isn't as salty as some other places like Libretto."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of A3. Uber Eats and all the other delivery services have managed to ruin the experience for me. Waited 1 hour 10 minutes for our dine in pizza (we were a party of 5). There was a huge line of pick you delivery cyclists waiting for orders. Staff kept telling me 10 minutes that turned out to be well over an hour wait. This has happened to me now three times, so would rather go to Libretto or Queen Margarita for a pizza. They need better staff and ensure customers who are dining in get served first. Server kept rolling her eyes when I kept asking for my pizza -- sorry girl, but if owner was here he would not tolerate your attitude."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza spot - can be fast take out or eat in!! simple Italian pizza with the most incredible flavours of keeping it simple to the perfect sauce, fresh herbs and toasted in a wood burning over of 900c for 90seconds!!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place looking for a quick snack. I was impressed at the concept and the fact that Pizzeria Libretto is behind it. The staff and food are fresh. The place is casual and one orders and pays up front at a counter and then it's a free-for-all for seating in the back -- this could be a frustration if one were to visit when it's busy and there's a lack of seating."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try A3 Napoli because I love Pizza Libretto. I went with 2 others and we ordered the large mixed fritta platter and a pizza fritta. The fritta mista arrived half cold. It seemed like they had taken the fried things on display in the cabinet and heated them up.. Poorly. The prawn was overlooked from being cooked twice, as was the fried risotto and meatballs. The pizza fritta was delicious but I would much prefer to go to libretto for pizza than come back to A3 Napoli."}
{"text":"This review is only for their delivery. When I visited the restaurant, the food was great. Tonight I ordered delivery through UberEats, and what a disappointment! Sticking to lunch & UberX.  Delivery was late (30 mins!), And the food was cold, soggy and the portions tiny. $13 + delivery the seafood fritti. When I visited I got double this."}
{"text":"This restaurant is kind of a take out joint with really good pizzas and other snacks, such as pizza fritta. :D

The margarita pizza is on point. Good mozzarella and basil. The sauce tasted super fresh. 

The owner is very knowledgeable about pizzas and the different styles. I saw him inspecting one of the pizza artists working in the dough for my order and told him to ditch the whole thing in the garbage after he sauced it because he did something wrong with the kneeding. I'm sure I would not have tasted the difference but that just shows his passion for a good pizza. 

Five star pizzas. This place is about that 00 dop life."}
{"text":"After a dismal pizza experience at another restaurant last night, one of my dining companions asked me if there were any pizzerias I did like in Toronto.  Well, there are two as a matter of fact.  1. Pizza Defina in Roncesvalles 2. A3 Napoli.

I remember the pizza from A3 Napoli being savory, fluffy, yet had good pull as you pulled on the crust.  A good pizza must have a good base and that base is the pizza dough.  They did it right, you'd never know they had recently opened at the time.

The margherita pizza was perfect, and I'd expect the others would be just as well made.  The deep fried 'il fritto' choices were lightly battered and deep fried to perfection.  To choose, at the counter they displayed some items but did not identify them with signs.  Please identify your foods! 

The beer selection is limited and a little pricey for a plastic cup of beer - seriously, for that price please provide glassware.

The ordering process needs improvement as they have a board behind the cash/bar combos counter.  This makes line ups longer than necessary as people try to decipher the menu vis-a-vis the food they are trying to identify.  What is nice is that they do provide those buzzing gadgets to let you know your food is ready.

It is a small restaurant with plenty of seating so bring your friends (up to 8 per table), and enjoy some good pizza in Toronto, because there aren't many good pizza restaurants here.

{"text":"Went to A3 Napoli last night with a group of 6 and a toddler. Food was great, exceeded my expectations. We had the assortment of fritto misto - we don't tend to a lot of fried foods but these were perfectly done, not too greasy. We also had a margherita pizza, their spicy pepperoni pizza and a fried pizza. The crusts were awesome! 

Although the food was great I'm giving a 3 star rating for a few reasons 1. The women working the cash. Maybe she was just having a bad day but I found her very rude. I wouldn't want this person representing my brand/restaurant. It's too bad because the three guys in the kitchen were awesome and very friendly. 2. Logistics; ordering at the front, not having paper menus and them not opening a tab. We wanted to have a drink prior to deciding what to order but this set up isn't very conducive to relaxing. Very cafeteria like. Plus not having menus created a bottle neck of people at the front cash area - with people trying to decide what to order."}
