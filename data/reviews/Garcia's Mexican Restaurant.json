{"text":"New to the area and was looking for a good restaurant close by. Decided to try Garcia's after they sent us a coupon in the mail. From the reviews I gathered it would more  American- Mexican food and less authentic. I was ok with that and went to give it a try. Drinks: it was 5:30 and I thought we would get happy hour prices, but to my dismay I guess you have to check out by 6 and not put your order in by 6. Pretty crappy, but whatever. So I ordered what I think was called the coco motion margarita. It was terrible and tasted like a chemical cleaner and not good at all. Plus it was around $12! My husband ordered the ultimate margarita and he said it was ok. The chips,salsa and bean dip were disgusting. The salsa was a runny mess and the thick pastey bean dip was bland. On to the entree- I decided to try what they are known for the Pollo Fundido. It was terrible. There was so much melted gooey fake cheese on it...I just peeled it all off. Under the cheese was a later of sour cream, which didn't really go with the abundance of cheese, not to mention it was hot and runny. The chicken itself was just a shredded once again tasteless mess. The black beans, which I usually enjoy, were  bland and tasted like they were just dumped there from a can. They weren't even hot. My husband ordered  steak fajitas. Which he enjoyed. I tried a bite and it did taste pretty good. He ordered charro beans and they were the same, bland and gross. We will not be returning here. I guess if you decide to try it fajitas are probably your best bet. On a good note the staff was prompt and courtious."}
{"text":"Just passable food. Poor value for the money."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was very surprised at how good the food was. I ordered the grilled chicken Monterey and my husband and Mom ordered the Enchilada and Steak plate. They were both equally delicious. We also ordered Patron Margaritas and they were perfect! They were not sweet at all which I like. You can tell they actually added tequila, unlike  other places where they just sweeten the drink and add very little alcohol.  The waitress was very polite and the atmosphere was nice. I'm very critical when it comes to Mexican food and Margaritas!  Very few places can get both right."}
{"text":"Their grilled fish tacos are the bomb! But, if you sit at the bar area, service can be a little slow. Bartender needs a little help."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Our ultimate nachos were cold, the cheese was crusty and the steak was dry and had a burnt aftertaste. You could make better Nachos at home. The guacamole had no flavor it was just mashed avocado which had the faintest taste of avocado. The salsa was not spicy at all it was like watered down ketchup (but if that is what you like hey you do you). The appetizer platter was less than impressive. The best part was the cheese Crisp which was some of the worst I have had. There was a long wait, so we figured it must be good. Boy were we ever wrong! Steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful Tex-Mex! Food was fabulous, drinks were delicious and service was superb! Don't miss this! The atmosphere was relaxed and we really enjoyed ourselves. Our waiter, Emmanuel, was cheerful, made suggestions for our drink choices, and was available without being overbearing. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We we're impressed with the freshly made bean dip, salsa & chips!  I had the chicken tostada salad & gave the quesadilla's to my husband which he took home.  He had a shredded beef burrito with rice & beans & used some of my southwest dressing for his small salad.  Lots of good food & great service!  I loved the colors, to liked tables & all the decor!  The outside covered patio has a fireplace that looked cozy."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from me and I popped into on my way home from work (I was too lazy to drive to my usual Mexican place). I just want to grab a marg and takeout that was better then cheap Mexican food for the evening.   The hostess was very nice. I took a seat at the open bar and was offered chips and salsa shortly after sitting. I ordered the house margarita on the rocks with salt. It was good, but a little on the sweet side for my liking.   My Togo order consisted of a combo meal. I ordered the 3 items so I could have left overs for lunch tomorrow. I got am enchilada, taco, and burrito with rice and bean for 12 bucks. There was also complimentary chips and salsa, which is always a bonus!   Once I got home the food was very good! I will be returning again I the future."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  Love when yelpers give low ratings for free bean dip, friendly service and because there are so many Mexican food places!  Duh it's phoenix, try living in Ohio!!  Good food, friendly service. Still can't believe yelpers are so mad."}
{"text":"Good make your own combo and fried ice cream.but when there packed don't bother to expect good service."}
{"text":"It was decent. Service was good. Food was good - nothing spectacular. I did like the larger shrimp in the seafood fundida. I didn't like the Apple vodka sangria and the server was quick to notice I wasn't drinking it, so she offered and brought me another drink free of charge"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently came here for their happy hour special at the bar. You are supposed to get $3.99 margaritas and half price appetizers. So naturally, we ordered two margaritas and I ordered an appetizer.   I was charged full price for the \"half price\" appetizer and $11 for two supposedly \"$3.99 margaritas\". I'm very disappointed with the service. At one point the server said she wasn't allowed to serve us alcohol so we had to get up from our table and get them ourselves.   But! The do give you chips and queso dip for free. I should have just stuck with that."}
{"text":"We love the food once we get it.  I don't know what has happened to their service.  The last two times we were here my mother ordered a Corona both times it has taken over 10 min for it to get to the table. I'm not sure if they have reduced staff or what but I feel their service has suffered."}
{"text":"Yummy bean dip.  I enjoyed the food and had a sweet server who was very attentive"}
{"text":"The staff is always very friendly and do a great job.  The food is excellent. We love sitting out on the patio. They have a working fireplace and heaters when it's cold. Wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good quality Mexican food at a decent price. Very attentive wait staff and friendly management. Check out Living Social for a special menu at a discount price."}
{"text":"Was here Friday night.  Food is great.  The portions are huge.  And our waitress was so so nice.  I am from Minneapolis and we chatted some.  After our meal, we like the dip so much, we asked to pack the left over chips and dips on our table.  She instead packed a whole bagful of chips and dip.   We tipped her very handsomely."}
{"text":"Screaming child - nobody did anything. Customers leaving left and right. Awful experience-poor service- crappy food."}
{"text":"First off, the drinks we ordered were wrong. Iced teas turned into iced water, seriously.. water.. with ice.   Second, we had little to no communication with our waitress (lourdes). We weren't ever checked on by our waitress(lourdes). A different waitress who was working the tables to the left of us was very nice to give us refills and check on us from time to time. I wish I caught her name so I could mention how great she was.  Third, when we first walked in, we asked the host if they do anything special for birthdays (for my niece) and he said yes fried ice cream and we sing happy birthday.  My niece loves Garcia's bean dip so we took her there for her 6th birthday. Towards the end of our dinner we had to ask the other waitress who had been helping us all night, since Lourdes was nowhere to be found, to have them sing HBD to my niece and bring the ice cream. Lo and behold! It's Lourdes, she just hands my niece the ice cream and faintly says happy birthday while walking away. So we decided to sing the song to my niece ourselves. The kids were so well behaved the entire dinner too!! She was most excited for the singing part!  Finally,  once it was time to pay, that's when Lourdes was attentive and nice. Like, where were you this entire dinner!? So I paid and left only 15% tip due to the lack of hospitality shown. Once we start driving off of the parking lot, we noticed that my nephew had forgotten his godzilla action figure there (keep in mind, it had only been 3 mins and we were still in the car). After searching the car we went into the restaurant and asked to check the table for it. The table had been cleaned and there was no godzilla in sight. We know for a fact that it was left on the table because we were gone for literally 3 minutes!! My guess is that she threw it away based on the amount of tip that was left due to her wonderfully award winning customer service!!! **take a whiff of that sarcasm** We will never be going back to this place again!!!   It's one thing to have crappy service, but at least have decent food to make up for it.  So thanks Lourdes for ruining our days and my nephew's life. I now have to listen to him cry until toys r us opens in the morning.  In case you were wondering,  we went today on October 23, 2015 around 7 pm. Garcia's near 46th St. & Thomas. By the Arcadia Plaza."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Not very authentic, but tasted ok, and good if you have little kids with simple palates. Service was very poor unfortunately. We waited in the foyer of the restaurant for 5 minutes before anyone even noticed us. Two members of the wait staff were just hanging out at a booth in the bar. The bar tender saw us but did not make eye contact or greet us. I finally had to go interrupt the two servers who where chit chatting at the bar amongst themselves, to see if they could seat us. There was really no excuse for the poor service. There were only two other families eating in the whole restaurant. Sorry, don't think we will be back. When I go out to eat dinner, I expect good service."}
{"text":"This place is not good! The waiter was incomprehensible and the food is yucky. You're friends are going to say it's fine but don't give into peer pressure! The end!"}
{"text":"First time here wasn't that impressed. Ordered a Tamale plate with rice and beans. Tamales must of been mistaken for some other ingredient but it was killed with SALT!!! Could not stand another bite! Beans on the plate looked like it was sitting out for awhile. It was crusty and dry. Rice on the other hand was not that bad at all.   Sorry to say but I will not go back. Maybe just for Margaritas or beer."}
{"text":"I'll keep it short, this was the most terrible service....the worse service I've ever had. Food was ok but staff is terrible. They need training...lots of training and a smile now and then. Time to look for a new Mexican restaurant for me."}
{"text":"I'm a man who loves Mexican food, but I was not a fan of Garcia's. The restaurant and staff were fine but the food was not. When the food came out almost everything was burnt. It probably would have tasted fine otherwise but my meal was not."}
{"text":"Hi, great meal..just all the other times we ate there! The atmosphere is always pleasant and the service great. Sometimes I can't get over how great we feel after we ate there....always dependable! Cvanriper. For more info. Ca. Write carolsvanriper.cv@gmail.com"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great service and food.  The salsa was ok.  Best Garcias ive ever been too."}
{"text":"Disappointed - I have enjoyed dinner at this location multiple times supper and was not pleased with the service or the food. The food was lack lustre and so was the service."}
{"text":"Ive been here on multiple occasions and I have never been fully satisfied. The wait staff is poor. On one visit, two other couples had been seated and received their drinks before we even saw our waitress. Another time, we were the only ones in the restaurant and still waited 10 minutes before we saw our waitress to ask for the check.   The food: It comes out fast which is kind of scary. It makes me think that they are just popping in the microwave. I watch a lot of kitchen nightmares :-p  The chips and dip served when you arrive is more filling than the food to be honest.   I liked the margaritas...Good pricing!  Finally the best part: The chocolate mini chimis."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, lunch special kinda expensive for lunch .. GOOD BEAN DIP ....."}
{"text":"It sis absolutely obvious to anyone that has actually eaten here that any positive reviews are posted by the the owners. I am a Phoenix native. I grew up with this restaurant in town, so I was happy when they opened a location in my neighborhood. I have been there twice for take out, having a marg while I waited. My first visit was shortly after they opened. Went o the restroom for some tissue for my allergies and when the stall door closed the overhead beam from the stall came down at my head. Luckily my, cat-like reflexes allowed me to duck in time. I informed the manager on my way out of the restroom he had a lawsuit waiting to happen. He laughed and said he was sorry and sat right back down with his friends in the booth, leaving the beam on the floor I assume. Weird. the food sucked too but I gave them a pass on all of this since it was a new store.  Forward to tonight. Tacos so greasy Jack in the box would be jealous, Enchiladas and rice were so wet and soggy- like the were sitting in water all day. Everything was inedible and I am a very un-picky bachelor. Tossed it in the trash and ate my frozen chicken fingers. Never again."}
{"text":"Say what you want about service- which I am usually very critical of.. but I like this location, the prices, and the food. A lot of it reminds me of the dirty parts of detroit, but with better quality food. The seafood fundido is my favorite dish, a little spicy and creamy. The complimentary bean dip and salsa with chips is nice too. Get a giant margarita during happy hour if you like tequila. I have never had bad service here, in fact that is what has made me come back a few times already. Not to mention, no one eats in the Arizona Mills mall because they think it is \"ghetto\" so it is not too busy. I prefer going here on a saturday afternoon or a monday evening myself. I will bring my friend after we hit up some of the local shops in the mall. The fried ice cream is good for dessert too. For being a chain, this place is one of my favorites, besides Serrano's."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner at Garcia's this evening.  Ate at a table in the bar where we got Happy Hour prices on our drinks.  Margaritas and beers are good sized . The whole staff was friendly and we liked our food.  Service was fast.  This will become our go to mexican place if all our experiences are like this."}
{"text":"The food taste like the oil they cook it in. My cheese enchilada was burnt. The rice was very dry."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was. We came on a slow night, so I was only unimpressed with the very casual customer service. I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga and really enjoyed myself. I will definitely be coming back for it again."}
{"text":"This is the location inside Arizona mills mall. My wife and I ordered a couple two item dishes and shared them. Nothing was good here. Chips and salsa are bland. Tacos, tamales, and enchiladas were all flavorless. Even the rice is weird and left an awful after taste. We didn't finish anything, didn't take our leftovers to go. Paid the unbelievably high bill and walked out never to return. Yuck."}
{"text":"Do you guys serve Mexican food ? White people serve better Mexican food! The chips were not hot n crispy, they were plain and almost stale. Tasted like the cheapest tortilla chips ever; mission is better. Bean dip was flavorless paste. Tasted like cheap canned salsa. Made the mistake of ordering nachos.. the guacamole had big aweful tasting hard chunks in it. The sampler plater had a nasty dip but I have no idea what it was. Maybe cheese? Maybe spinach? Gross gross gross. We didn't like anything except the margarita. We left all of our leftovers. Never going back. Ever"}
{"text":"Ate at Garcias a few times over the years.  Up until tonight, it has always been a dependable place to get some good food with some good service.  We arrived later in the night and the place was maybe 40% full, but still had to stand up front waiting for anybody to greet us or seat us for a few minutes.    I ordered an iced tea that ended up tasting odd to me, but the server was nice about getting me something different.  However, the half drank tea cup remained on the table, stacked on two small dirty plates and were still on the table when we left.    The salsa and beans (which every table gets) were eaten quickly, but we were never asked if we would like more. Several tables around me were asked several times if they would like more.  The food was tasty and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"Came here for my husband's birthday. I have an onion allergy so it's hard for me to Mexican food places without them messing up my order and having to wait for them to remake it. I've had that problem before here, but our waitress, Yaya,  was awesome! She was friendly but not obnoxious and did a great job at refilling drinks, chips, salsa, and beans. She also made sure my food was correct and perfect! Very pleased with our experience and it was all because of her!"}
{"text":"It's much better there than my previous visits the food and staff are very friendly and I visit this restaraunt frequently.      My last review I meant to give a four star Instead of three.  So this makes up for the mistake.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout late-ish one night, combo with two chicken tacos, black beans, and rice. WTH were the tacos just placed in aluminum foil and stuck in a plastic bag that also included a container with an enchilada and the other containers of the beans, rice, salsa, and whatever else was in the order? Of course the taco shells were completely crushed.  I still ate them. Flavor-wise, they were OK. Service was fine otherwise, and the chips were good. Rice is kind of bland. I'd try them again, but I'll make sure I specify that I'd like the tacos also in an aluminum container with a lid so that they don't get smashed.  Who serves smashed tacos??? :("}
{"text":"We went there on a Wednesday night,  and sat on the outside patio.   There was nobody sitting there except for us.   The bartender/waitress was nice and we got our food and drinks in a timely manner.   The house margaritas were great, and the ultimate nachos were tasty.    From what we hear they have a daily happy hour, so we will come back for that.    The margaritas although very tasty, were a tad bit expensive."}
{"text":"1. Good Customer Service 2. Clean Atmosphere 3. Good Margaritas 4. YUMMIE Carna Asada Burrito"}
{"text":"Meh. Decent food.. definitely satisfied my craving with a meal smothered in cheese. The salsa and dip are really good I can't help but fill up on that."}
{"text":"Service at this location is bad.  Food is bland and generic mexican, for a better experience go almost anywhere else.  Canned and processed in taste there is likely a better result at home even if you can barely cook."}
{"text":"The service here, in the few times I ate here, completely sucked. The food took forever and the servers I had were rude. Not only that, but they always seemed to screw up my order. For the price of the food and atmosphere, avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Ashlee was a fantastic server! Always on top of the drinks and anything we needed she was already bringing it before we had to request it. Their fajita salad is huge and really good! $10.49 and their taco salad is good too $9.99."}
{"text":"I used to go here every weekend before the movies.  I used to be a great customer, always ordering food and drinks until staff accused me of taking pictures of a bartender and not my food.  I am a good hardworking citizen and a loyal customer but the bar is run down.  After they remodeled the outside they could do more on inside."}
{"text":"\"I wanna go to the flower place!!\" was the reaction when i asked my cousin and friend where we should have lunch inbetween classes one Arizona afternoon. I couldn't think of what she meant when she said, flower... I instantly thought of Cherryblossom Noodle Cafe but I was quickly corrected when she said that she was referring to the rose in the Garcia's logo.  Now, I have never been to one of the Garcia's Chain resturants, but the Original Garcia's off of 35th ave has been an institution in my family for decades. I was willing to try the AZ mills chain location since it was near by... and I would later regret it.  We entered a very beautiful place, everything was very open and can be seen from the mall's walk ways. It was slightly unnerving to try to enjoy some messy taco while some lil 5 year old in a stoller stares at you. Ummm... no... Timmy... this is MY taco!! Back off!   It was 2 in the afternoon and we were the ONLY customers there... and the mall was PACKED! That should have told me something, but we still sat at a tiled table anyway. The hostess/waitress brought us the SALTIEST bowl of chips ever! it came with salsa and a bean dip that was way too heavy on the onions in both cases. I could barely eat the salsa, but I couldn't hang with the beans at all.   We ordered our food and it came out very quickly. My friend ordered green corn tamales and she liked them but I they were on the rubbery side and my cousing got the taco and tostada combo and thought it was okay, she didn't complain. And I got the minature sampler and was unimpressed. it was just food... nothing great or special or exceptionally awful... just average.   What wasn't average was the bill.... nearly $50 for our meals?! Are you kidding?! And we didn't even have a hard drink on the table! I paid but wasn't happy about it... I thought it was going to be a lil less than that!  To my yelpers: I know the Arizona Mills area is a cesspool of resturants, where chains reign surpreme... and unfortunatly, this place is amongst one of the worst. I say, save your money and skip out on this place because it's nothing significant and the saltyness of their food will only make your bloated as you're shopping afterward and that can't be cute!"}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. Amazing how terrible the food is. If you want to loose weight check it out I am sure you won't eat much."}
{"text":"The food was ok. No taste, or flavor of real Mexican food. The only thing good was the beer, because they didn't make it. Service was like hurry eat and get going from their waitress.."}
{"text":"Tampico chicken was recommended by the waitress and did not disappoint.  The food was fresh, nicely presented, and had excellent flavor.  Visited on a Thursday night at 5:30 p.m.  The place was quiet and the service great.  Customers started arriving in mass around 6.  The portions were generous and although the interior was more bar-like than Mexican, it didn't disappointment.  The neighborhood was somewhat \"shady\", but the food made up for it.  Will go again."}
{"text":"I wish I got the servers name, she was fantastic! I came in with a group of deaf friends. Some servers dont know what to do and end up looking to me to interpret everything, they don't realize that Deaf people are excellent communicators if u just give them the chance. She spoke and gestured to each person, paying close attention to what they needed, giving them their dignity as well as joking with them the whole time. What a breath of fresh air!! I wish more servers were like her! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yes, I admit, I never got over the 90's. The clothes. The music. The fajitas. Oh yes, the fajitas. Millennials have largely been deprived of the glory of sizzling meat, onions and peppers on an overheated iron skillet. It makes me very sad for them.   In the 90's every major chain and Mexican-ish joint pretty much featured this quintessentially Americanized Mexican specialty. Now, like cars with stick shifts, they've been relegated to the back lot of culinary history.   Not at Garcia's. After an extensive search including multiple google queries and one fruitless stop at a competitor, I found Garcia's and a delicious, sizzling platter of lunch special goodness.   Seriously, I have no idea how anything else on the menu is. But the fajitas are freaking good."}
{"text":"Excellent Customer Service and Great Food!! We come here almost once a week due to the fun environment and Awesome staff. They take great care of their customers and haven't let my drink run dry yet! Thank you for taking pride in your work.....Good Job!!"}
{"text":"I called over the phone to to set up a pick up order of Chips and Salsa and requested the price over the phone then repeated the amount to the lady on the phone for verification to assure I went down there with enough cash for the food and tip based on what she quoted  me. I don't quite remember what I paid when I picked up the last order but the price she gave me was very close and the amount sounded correct. I went to the bar to pick up my order and the bartender made it very apparent I was an annoyance to him by his body language and the way he approached me rudely asking \"Did you need help? I couldn't tell because you seem to be just watching TV?\". I was shocked by his response because I was just trying to be patient while he finished what he was doing and was attempting to be courteous. I told him I was there for pick up and gave my name. When he picked the ticket off the food he told me I owed literally twice as much as what I was quoted. After I explained what I was quoted he told me \"You must have gotten confused\" which in my opinion is pretty hard to do when you are only calling in an order of chips and salsa. I explained that I double verified the price so I would know if I needed to stop at an ATM for extra cash before hand. At this point the bartenders attitude began to change even more for the worst as he attempted to scold me about being more clear when I call over the phone and next time I order just know what the price is no matter what the person says on the phone!!! I then asked to speak with the manager still being able to keep my cool. He then shook his head and laughed quietly as he walked to the back mocking me. The manager backed his employee not even listening or addressing what might have caused the confusion and simply reduced the price and walked away without wanting much interaction with me as it appeared him and the bartender where friends. However I know the GM was not in that day (I have seen him before when we ate there previously) and I'd like to the the situation would have been handled much more professionally if he were there. But after 10 years of personal management experience I can assure others this situation was handled horribly and the owner/GM really need to look at the quality of people they are employing."}
{"text":"Came here alone on a business trip, restaurant wasn't terribly busy for a Sunday. The chips were ok but the bean dip was really good! Got the Pollo Monterrey and it was really good. A large juicy chicken breast served over fresh pico de gallo topped with avocado slices and then cheese over top served with rice - ingredients were fresh flavored were simple and well done. The restaurant was clean with nice decor, wait staff was nice enough, I would have gone for 4 stars but there just wasn't anything that really stood out here!"}
{"text":"i went Saturday with a friend. It was the biggest disappointment ever! We came in, it wasn't too busy considering it was the weekend. There were several staff at the entrance, yet no one greeted us or asked how many in our party..they just ignored us. Finally after waiting several minutes we decided to seat ourselves. once again ignored we sat waiting for waitress so we could order. eventually one came by and got our drink order.. 10 minutes go by and our drinks arrive. we told the waitress we were ready to order some appetizers. again it took for ever to get that and when we did it was cold, . OK sometimes that happens. we tried to get the waitress to have them fix it the issue but our waitress Angela never came back.. she would stop at the table next to us but wouldn't acknowledge us. the only helpful person there was the busser who spoke no english (couldnt understand what we meant when we asked for our waitress,told us sorry no english), at least she brought us some chips. finally Angela our waitress came to the table with our check.. yes thats right our check! she only showed up to take our order and to drop our check off.. umm hello i came for dinner not just apps. what a gem!! i would NOT recommend this place to anyone! ive had better food at del taco and better service at a taco stand!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is TERRIBLE!!!! started with a margarita that tasted worse then pine sol(cleaning supplies). the food all looked exactly the same. weird because i believe it was all frozen and just heated up. we had a party of 5 and we all felt sick shortly after beginning to eat it. if you like salt you will enjoy this food. another reason that we all belive that they just heay up frozen food. if i could give this place 0 out of 5 i wood. DONT GO!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great! Walked in, saw empty space at the far end of the bar, went over to find that the space was empty because there were no chairs there but within seconds one of the guys/manager(?) was carrying over 2 chairs for us to use!  Then within seconds of sitting down we had someone delivering chips, salsa and bean/dip.  Then came the friendly bartender service (Adam), who informed us of their happy hour and 1/2 price happy hour app specials, etc.   We ordered the chicken/steak combo fajitas and added a cup of the tortilla soup to it. The soup came out first and was hot and had lots of chunks of chicken in it! We were not disappointed.  You can't beat that for an extra $2.50! The fajitas came out sizzling (just the way we like them) and were cooked perfectly. There was a lot of meat - more than you usually get on combo fajitas.  We really liked the atmosphere and with service and food backing it up - we'll go back and tell our friends!"}
{"text":"I wish Yelp gave you the oppertunity to give half a star because I debated between three and four stars on this one.  The reason I went with three is because it is pretty good food but generic.  I had the Chili Verde which is one of my favorites on this menu.  Also I had the house magrarita which could use a tad bit more taquila.  The service was great and our server was spot on tonight, though we have been here before and they have been the worst we have ever had.  All in all we would come back because the food is pretty good but probably also because of the location."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken fajitas and sopapillas from uber eats and everything was amazing!  Huge portions that were both fresh and delicious. It arrived in a timely manner even on Mothers Day.  I couldn't be happier with my order. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The beans aren't that great.  The only thing I get here which I think is great is the pollo fundido.  I have also had the tortilla soup which was quite tasty as well, and on a surprising note, their fries are awesome, but the burgers only so so.....pollo fundido with fries....hmmmm.  I go here about once a  year."}
{"text":"I went to Garcia's as part of a company business trip to Phoenix. As excited as I was to temporarily escape the record snowfall in Boston, I was even more excited to indulge in Mexican food. The service was absolutely excellent and the free bean dip and chips was such a wonderful surprise. I had the enchiladas and afterwards we all indulged in the churros with a savory cream cheese dip. Next time I am in Phoenix, I definitely want to come back. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The worst \"mexican\" food i have ever had. The portions were enormous but so bad. The steak in my quesadilla was tough and didn't taste good at all. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican food, especially for the price. Last night I went with a friend and our tab for 1 entree and 4 house margaritas (2 each) was $45. Occasionally, I go for happy hour because it's the only place closer to home that has a patio. Appetizers are 1/2 off during happy hour but I don't think the drink specials are that great. I just go because I like to sit on the patio when the weather is nice. Service is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"Food was very bland. No flavor at all. Do not waste your time or money eating here. Fish tacos had more cabbage and mayo than actual fish inside of it. Wasted 35.00."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food restaurants around. Awesome chips ad salsa, great environment and great nice and friendly service. Food comes out fast and fresh, no complaints at all. Favorite meal is the burrito meal that is covered with cheese and sour cream and awesome tender juicy chicken inside burrito. Highly recommended Garcia's!! Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I would put Garcia's about one-and-a-half steps above fast food. Overall food quality is seriously lacking for a sit-down, more expensive-type restaurant.  The value isn't there, as most all of the food seems like frozen, pre-packaged food you could buy at a Costco or the grocery store.  I'm not sure whether that is a problem with all Garcia's, or whether this particular location simply isn't making the grade.   The most recent time we came here, I ordered the chile verde burrito, with beans on the side.  Mind you this was an $11+ burrito, and when it came out, it only had about four or five pieces of meat in it.  The rest was a huge tortilla folded over and over again on itself.  No value there whatsoever. And it actually didn't taste that good. Note this is not a fluke as I've ordered this on at least one other occasion and it was the same way.   It was the same for the other food - none of it seemed freshly prepared in any way. All of it had the look of frozen processed food, that was simply warmed up in a microwave, oven, or deep fryer.  The chimichangas were all \"perfect\" and had a processed meat sauce. The burritos were clearly frozen burritos by their shape and folding.   Overall, there are much better places you can visit for the price you would pay here. Maybe at one time this place was good, but it isn't anymore. Look elsewhere for authentic Mexican food that actually tastes good!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say! We ordered online for pick up then when we arrived the hostess said they don't check online orders when they are busy. Really, no wonder businesses fail. Here is my recommendation: don't allow online orders until you have people who actually know how to manage it. No more Garcias for this guy.  Poor service, mediocre food, the star they get is for the name."}
{"text":"Located in the mall across the street from our hotel, this was a great family place that served us quickly and attentively. Good kids menu, and my wife and friend enjoyed their strawberry margaritas. L had the Olivia Sampler combo, which was very filling, and l look forward to enjoying the free cheese crisp tonight over a football game. (It is very big, and will make a great appetizer for Yelp families looking at this place.) It's very clean and the staff is both friendly and responsive to any issues or concerns. We had one order correction, which they handled very fast. We look forward to returning here the b do time we are in town!"}
{"text":"We decided to have Mexican food and ordered take out from this Garcias. The food was great and were shocked that we got so much food for the price compared to Filibertos. The chips are so good."}
{"text":"Best nachos I've had anywhere in AZ , food is always hot and service is great. Only complaint I have is your Restaraunt is to cold."}
{"text":"This location is much better than the mesa location! The salsa is very fresh and the bean dip hasn't been watered down with water in a pathetic attempt to stretch it. The food was hot and fresh, unlike the mesa location. I ordered the red Chile Colorado and my husband ordered the ultimate nachos. Both dishes were plentiful and delicious! My parents both ordered burritos and enchiladas which they raved about. Customer service at this location is superior compared to the mesa location also. The waiter was polite and seemed generally happy. I will be back again and again. But never will I ever make the mistake of going to the mesa location just because it's closer to home."}
{"text":"So I ordered a burrito from this \"establishment\" and there was plastic wrap cooked INSIDE my food. Luckily it wasn't melted in my food so I just pulled it out. When I notified the DISTRICT MANAGER who happened to be on duty at that time she was peeved that I told her I wasn't going to let her remake my food because obviously their staff does not follow the proper food handling procedures otherwise this little mishap never would have happened. She then grabbed her other manager ERIC and they proceeded to attack me and ask me not to return to Garcia's. This  is completely backwards. Dude, you guys cooked plastic wrap into my food and you're mad at me? Brian the server is horrible and talks to customers unprofessionally. I will not be back to this location. I recommend that you take your business to a cleaner establishment."}
{"text":"We were dissapointed.  We wanted to eat outside and were told to seat ourselves.  We did and found that there was food encrusted on the table tops and several tables had not been cleared.   We went back inside and though the service was adequate, the food was bland and uninteresting."}
{"text":"When I arrived I was surprised to see beautiful flowers outside and bright colors inside - at first I was impressed. However, our server seemed overwhelmed and the only words he spoke were to take our order many minutes after we arrived. I want to give this place a break - there were only teenage kids working and we came on a busy night. But, the food was unimpressive and I really see no reason why I'd want to visit again except to get their yummy key lime breath mints."}
{"text":"By far the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Service was good but the food was beyond bland. The kids hated the nachos and when I took the leftovers home, I had to revamp it and work my magic on it. The nachos on the cheese was burnt and horrible. They didn't use the traditional nachos cheese. I've never had a bad tasting chimichanga until this. It was so bad I couldn't even eat half of it. It was like eating rough tortilla with old dry chicken. I don't cook Mexican food that's authentic but even my American bought Mexican groceries to make nachos and chimichangas from Safeway would taste better than theirs. Never again. For the price of the food, it wasn't worth it. Even the chips were like eating cardboard. I only enjoyed their bean dip. Seating and set up is nice inside."}
{"text":"Really great service, server was friendly and quick. Food was served promptly and was hot and delicious. Great place, would recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to love Garcia's. Then after 2 really bad experiences (we are talking raw chicken bad), I didn't go for close to 3 years. Decided to go back about 4 months ago because I had a coupon and was hoping they had fixed the problems. Now after 3 visits, I can say they are back!!! I always get the Pollo Fundido. Chicken wrappted in jalapeno cream cheese and deep fried. YUM! I love their chips and salsa and bean dip that they serve. The service has been great each time since we started going back. There are usually $5 off coupons out there which is a great added bonus. They have great fajitas as well but I have a hard time straying from my pollo fundido! I am so happy they are back to really good food and service. Reasonable prices as well!"}
{"text":"This place is the Applebees of Mexican restaurants.  The place is clean but lacks any character.  The food is decent but does not stand out at all, pretty bland and lacking any of the rich flavors of its more traditional counterparts.  The service was good and friendly.  All in all it screams \"safe\" chain restaurant.  There is much better Mexican food to be found in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Best tortilla soup I have ever had!"}
{"text":"We'll love Garcia's, as a great neighborhood restaurant with good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Amazing. Came from San Diego and tasted amazing! Defiantly stopping here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Came here on Mother's Day we got seated immediately! 2 adults and a baby. They gave us a coupon for free entree for next visit and we ordered our food and drinks and got our food out to us in less then 10 minutes it was a very pleasant experience at this location. Very prompt service! Thank you for making my Mother's Day great! :) will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Waited at the front for about 10 minutes to be seated.  Waiters/waitresses/bus boys kept passing us and never said anything, no one ever came to seat us.  The place was in no way busy with probably 70% of the seating open.  I stopped someone and started to ask (nicely) \"is this seat yourself or should.....\" and was interrupted with \"one moment\" and the guy walked off, no one ever came back.    I've previously ate there and thought the food was fine but not worth terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have had a decent experience both times. The menu is large with a lot of different choices and reasonably priced. Kids eat for .99 on Sundays which is always a good thing.  We went this past Sunday and were seated promptly. There were a lot of people dining but a good amount of open tables left. Our server came over quickly (do not recall his name) and took our drink order. When he came back to take our food order he came across like he was paying attention but got a few things wrong. Not usually a big deal if it's something that can be corrected, but he had to be reminded. When the manager came by to ask how everything was (toward the end of the meal) we let him know that the kid's meals were incorrect but they had eaten more than half. He offered free dessert but we were stuffed.  I ordered the pollo fundidto and it was alright. The cream cheese didn't have much spice like I expected it to. My husband was happy with his fish tacos and his mom loved the carnitas tacos. The chips, salsa, and bean dip prior to the meal was good and of course I made the mistake of eating too much.   I love that Garcia's is just down the street so we will definitely be back...but probably just on Sundays."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food.  I like to order their Enchiladas Trio or Pollo Fundido.  The beef ench with green sauce is probably the best enchilada on the Trio plate, but I like having variety, and the others are still very good.  They give pretty good sized portions and I always have left overs for the next day.  There are happy hour drink prices, but you have to order it in the bar."}
{"text":"Over the past year we have frequented this Garcia's location a handful of times and have not been disappointed in service or the food flavors.  We are huge Mexican food fans and this place, while not uber authentic, puts together nice, flavorful plates and solid margaritas at a great value and in a unique and convenient locale.  We recommend and will continue to patron."}
{"text":"The waitress called my friend \"the baby\". It was amazing       Also the food was really good"}
{"text":"We Love Garcias!  Great food awesome service and amazing Margarittas!  Please open up in the empty don Pedro's in San tan  valley!"}
{"text":"I was at this place a few days ago.  The last time I was in Phoenix I had a pleasant experience at this place, but that was not the case this time.    The chips were stale like if they were from an old Tostitos bag. I asked for my steak medium and I was given well done (no flavor).  Lastly I asked for one of the best Margarita on the menu (not the ones from Happy Hour) and it had very little Tequila. :("}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times and usually enjoyed ourselves and the food.  This time was a bit different.  The food was still quickly made and enjoyable, but our waitress disappeared for a good 15 minutes.  During this time we watched an employee scoop the chips out of a large container to fill the basket up.  Then the same employee reached into the container holding the chips with his BARE HANDS and grabbed some chips and put them in his mouth!  Horribly unsanitary!  The date this occurred was 1-11 during dinner.  I'm not sure we'll be returning anymore."}
{"text":"The salsa and chips were tastey...... The actual food... Not so much. I ordered the fish tacos. I really could have gotten better at Del Taco. Mushy, small pieces of fish, with a big handful of cabbage on top. My daughter got the Southwest Enchiladas and they had absolutely no flavor. Just a ton of cheese and beans. Cups, plates and silverware were either dirty or very worn and old. Just not a good experience at all. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I frequent Garcia's when I want good Mexican food.  The spinach enchiladas are wonderful.  Garcia's also has the best salsa around."}
{"text":"Our experience last time wasn't so good but we just ate here and had Mario as our server. He was the best; very kind and checked on us enough without being overbearing. Thanks mario!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times since its opened. The service is great, but the wait time sometimes is kinda long. Their bean dip doesn't taste the same as the other restaurants which is a killer cause it so good. But this restaurant is good. Friendly helpful and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Good food if you like grease. Pours on drinks are lite, so order a beer if you're going to get drinks."}
{"text":"Went with the family and had a good meal.  My sister wanted bowls of sour cream for the chips, and they promptly brought them for her.  The service in general was excellent.  Had the cheese enchiladas platter and it was very good.  The bean dip, salsa, and chips went great with the Corona beer."}
{"text":"Disgruntled and uninterested is the best description I can give to the services provided by the bartender/waitress at this location of Garcia's.  I was sadly disappointed.   Maybe you'll be more fortunate if you come at a different time.  I showed up for happy hour on a Tuesday at 3pm.  The food was decent but not good enough to overshadow the unhappy, unfriendly server."}
{"text":"Great fast service. Good food and lots of it. Friendly staff. Good ambiance. Make it a must go to if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick drink once I learned that happy Hour exists over here at Arizona Mills (none at Rainforest). A few folks were at the bar around 5pm, but tons of specials available including 1/2 price appetizers, which I never tried. I was planning on sampling, but then they gave me this giant dish of weird circular chips and a hot bean dip and fresh salsa also for free. The bean dip was actually quite good, not spicy and the salsa was bursting with green onions and had a nice regular salsa taste. Also had a giant beer (23 oz) for 1/2 price, which came out to only $2.71. Three TV's at the bar were kinda small, but did the trick. They probably should hire another server to work the bar tables because bartender had to cover it and that left the bar empty for long stretches."}
{"text":"Ordered from Uber Eats I was absolutely amazed at how good they are. I am not even done with my meal yet but I had to post. Everything is flavorful properly packaged for to go and fresh! I will definitely order many more times."}
{"text":"Ok food, and my time here was good until the toddler behind my table started screaming at the top of his lungs. The kid just screamed and screamed until we were almost finished with our meal.. None of the employees did a thing about it."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Garcia's for over 30 years, they have some of the best Mexican food in the valley. It's nice that it's been family owned all these years and keeping the same recipes and consistency. Their Green Chile is the best in the valley"}
{"text":"So looking forward too good Mexican in Arizona but was so so disappointed in this restaurant.  The food was sub par, the waiter was not friendly.  So disappointed.  Big disappointment."}
{"text":"While there are some good items on the menu, the short answer is dine with caution. I would suggest dining here only out of convenience or perhaps happy hour.  Nachos appetizer is great! They include generous helpings of everything you would want.   Steak Fajitas are abysmal. The quality of the steak was so low, that they should finely chop the steak Filberto's style (pre-chewed). For the price your paying, you will feel robbed.  The service was poor. The only person who seemed to care about what was going on was the Mexican in charge of chips service. I saw him frequently checking the dining room status. Unfortunately for us, the same attention was not paid by our waiter to our water or beer service. Waited 10+ minutes after chips to receive drinks.   The ambiance - well decorated and remodeled from what it was prior. Good looking interior. We unfortunately were sat by a group of stay at home moms listening to a sales presentation for a weight wrap. While slightly hilarious, I would have expected any self-respecting business owner to realize how destructive to other patrons dining experience multiple 40 year old women standing and giving weight band sales testimonials would be."}
{"text":"This Garcias used to be my favorite restaurant to visit on at least a weekly basis. Last week I had placed a phone order for 2 sour cream chicken enchiladas and a taco to go. When I got home there wasn't any taco, but I was charged for it so I called Garcias and spoke with a manager. The manager was really nice and said he would give me $10 the next time I came in. Today I took my mother to Garcias and remembered I had the $10 off to use. When the waiter came by I tried to explain about the $10 off, and he started saying I need to give him the coupon when I ordered my food and I will have to speak with the manager. I didn't physically have a coupon to give to the waiter, it was offered to me over the phone. I saw the waiter go into the kitchen and was telling someone about this \"coupon\" but I didn't see who he was talking too. A little while later a manager 'Eric' came over to our table looking as if I was some kind of inconvenience to him. He said, \"you wanted to see the manager.\" As I was explaining to him the situation he just shrugged his shoulders as if to say So? This manager totally made me feel as though I was trying to get food for free! He said well if it's true it will be in our book. I was so mad! I told him you know what go and check your book, if it's not in there I will gladly pay the bill, but I will never be back!  The manager returned and said it was in the book, you get $10 off, your bill is $10.50. NOT even an apology for the humiliation he and the waiter had just caused us. It's sad situation when you don't want to go to a restaurant because the people who run it think all their customers are to eat for free. Well I work hard for my money and I will be spending it elsewhere in future!"}
{"text":"Gross, microwaved food, slow service, cheap salsa, beans are watery mess. Bean dip is awfull.  Much better places then this place, go somewhere else for mexican, taco bell would be better."}
{"text":"I hate to be the one who starts comparisons to the old Garcia's that was almost exactly 2 miles south but it IS inevitable...  I came for one item and one item only (something too pique my childhood culinary memory)... the Ultimate Nachos.  The family  always got them to go because they were right down the street. :A layer of chips with cheese melted, guac and sour crean and another layer of chips,  beans, cheese, lettuce more guac and sour cream and black olives on top and assembled  in an aluminium pie tin type to go container .    But what I got was:  Yes I got aluminum, but it was a 9\"X11\" piled with chips, cheese beans and enchilada sauce (which made it soggy)  and canned jalapenos.  A 4 oz sour cream and guac  on the side.  The styro's weren't full (being dished out with an ice cream scoop) so there was no way to try and recreate my childhood food memory by smearing quac and sour cream on top of  the contents of this huge aluminum pan.  The beans and chips and salsa while I waited were a nice touch but were spirited away just as my to-go order was brought out (I had plans to dump the salsa et al.  into one of the to-go containers because it can't served again).  But with skilled military precision they swooped in at the moment my food was being delivered and saved the uneaten salsa from being eaten....ever!"}
{"text":"Wow. I am extremely surprised how many bad reviews this place has, considering we've been here a handful of times and we have never gotten food poisoning or bad service... hmmmmmm..  First time we came here, it was a hit for me. I got the chimichanga with refried beans and rice. And a house salad with ranch. Kris likes their enchiladas and burritos, everything was super good and delicious.  The service is usually on top of things, except that the 2nd time we went, the waiter completely forgot my salad and margarita, but brought it after I mentioned it- which came after the dinner. Bleh. Plus they got me shredded beef instead of grounded beef in my burrito like I have asked. They offered to redo it, but I was too hungry and said that was not necessary.. I just didn't want to be eating someone else's burrito. And the Pineapple margarita that I ordered looked nothing like the menu picture, was not even pineapple-flavored either.  The manager comped the burrito off the bill, but kinda wished he would have comped the drink and salad. Oh well.   I guess it's a hit or miss for some people, I'll give Garcia's the benefit of the doubt for that bad night and give'em a 4 star for now."}
{"text":"I love Garcias !!  We eat here twice a month and every single time the food has been amazing. The salsa , bean dip and warm chips are my favorite of any other Mexican restaurant we have been. We will continue coming here and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We first tried this place on Uber Eats! It was delicious enough for us to go there in person. This place is great, excellent fresh food, great atmosphere and amazing service! The restaurant was clean and the servers were all so polite. I love their tortilla soup and kids eat for 99 cents on Sunday! What a great time! We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Starting off - no Host / Hostess. Sat ourselves at a \"high-top\" table. Veronica, the bartender was truly overwhelmed with absolutely ZERO assistance from any manager that was casually working his way seating the occasional customer. Saw several customers that grew tired of waiting at the unattended host stand left.   Our \"El Grande Fiesta Platter\" appetizer took over 20 minutes to come to the table. 1/2 the items were burned and unappetizing. While picking off the burned \"crisps\" / food items, saw the manager take a napkin off s dirty table and give it to a customer that sat himself at an empty bar seat.   Obviously very short staffed and \"in the weeds\".   But, Veronica was certainly doing the best she could possibly do single handily without any help from management / leadership of the establishment."}
{"text":"Eric !!!!!! is amazing! My husband and I asked our server for the name of the guy that was buzzing all over the place, working like a slave - nonstop - constantly smiling, happy, asking if anyone needed anything, bringing refills, greeting people, clearing tables ..... he was absolutely the most wonderful, friendly,  helpful personality in the place!!  BEST service of any eating establishment we've been to in this area. Five star !!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Truly a bizarre experience here, more than a bad one, but shitty nonetheless, thus the one star.  I will start with the positives in fairness to the restaurant, as they did just open a few weeks ago.   1) The food is alright. Nothing too special, nothing bad.  Alright, with the good out of the way, lets get into the bad. This place is an epic service fail, with the hash-tag and all.  Originally, I had four friends at my house and we ordered take out from the restaurant. I placed a $70 order for food and please take note of the dollar amount, it will be important later.  We each ordered a combo plate, so five combo plates, each with a couple different items. I made sure to tell them on my order, that I do not want beans, as I am allergic to them.  Order was taken and I was told to be there in approximately 30 minutes.  I showed up to the restaurant right on time and was told to wait. Not a big deal, a few minutes wont kill me, at least they are getting the order right and it was a large order. After waiting twenty minutes, they delivered the order and I left.   What ensued was quite simply the most absurd packaging job ever. I will try and break it down. So on three of the five combos, we had a taco ordered. Well, they put the three tacos in the same box ,not with their respective combo. They did this with everyones order. So it was kind of like a buffet, but having to rebuild what you had ordered. Why on earth would you do this? Add to that, they still got the order wrong and left out items while including stuff no one ordered.  To cap it, they had beans and rice in every box, so I could not eat it anyways.   I politely called the restaurant and the manager eagerly took my call. She apologized profusely and offered to either refund the money or would rather have me come back in and will credit my meal and mark it in her log. I really respected her cantor on the call and her professionalism and took the credit instead, as I was willing to give this neighborhood spot a second chance as the manager had won me over and I wanted to have another go to Mexican restaurant near by.  Fast forward a week later and myself and girlfriend go into said Garcias to dine in person. Upon walking in, I asked the hostess about my credit and she said she would ask the manager. We were seated at a nice table for two and within a couple of minutes a manager approached our table. She introduced herself and for a moment acted like she didn't remember our call. Then I said check your log and she came back with our waiter and said \"oh yes, I spoke to you on the phone and noted it, I am really glad you came back\" She put her hand on the waiter, who was standing literally next to her and said \"he will take care of anything you need\". Everyone smiled, situation is good, lets order. We order one appetizer, the espinaca con queso and we each order a combo. Food is delivered timely, hot, and pretty good, not great, but decent enough, we think all is fine.  Now the waiter says \"I will bring you your check.\" So I am thinking, he must know I want to tip him and didn't bring cash, so he is going to charge me a dollar so I can tip on my card. Nope, this guy brings me a $32 bill. I look at him and say, \"Sir, we were supposed to be credited, by your manager who was standing here.\" This guy literally looks right at me and says \"What? I don't remember\". My girlfriend and I just look at each other because we are now sure we are on camera, this must be an elaborate prank. I say right back to him \"you were standing right here, are you on something?\" He looks at me and then says he will go ask another manager, that manager we spoke too, with him there has left. He comes back over ten minutes later with a $22 bill. They took $10 off.   My girlfriend and I just bust out laughing, we pay the bill and leave, just enjoying the massive humor this place has just provided us for years to come. We spent $70 on bad pickup order and instead of being credited back $70, or at just the $32 to cover our smaller meal this time around, we actually spent more.  TOTAL SHIT SHOW. AVOID."}
{"text":"Promised the waiter I'd give him a nice tip if he gave me good service. He brought warm chips and replenished salsa + bean dip. Spinach enchilada dinner with queso spinach sauce was meh. Staff seems nice overall. Tipped him $15 on a $17 bill. Would be nice if service were just as good without having to make gratuity promises."}
{"text":"A good place to go for a heavy handed margarita and some bland-gross burritos and super slow service.   My husband and I came here for the living social pre-fix menu. We each ordered a margarita, both ways. I got the frozen one and it is so strong I felt tipsy after a few sips. We also ordered the poco chimis which weren't that bad.  Then out come out main dishes.  My husband had the combo with a burrito and an enchilada, and I had the grande burrito. We both noticed that the burros had too much skin and made the burrito dry. After doing some \"food surgery\" by peeling the top layer back and taking off the second layer, the burrito was better but not much of an improvement.  We also ordered the fried ice cream which was probably the best part of the meal.  Sad, isn't it?  Needless to say, we won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I have been to Garcia's before. Not a bad place to get some Mexican food. Margaritas are good and the chips and Salsa are better than average."}
{"text":"We've had an awesome experience here!! Seated fast, they immediately brought chips with salsa and beans, took our order fast and brought us our drinks!! All within 5 minutes of sitting down. I loved the chips and beans so much I was too full for my meal. But! I had an enchilada and it was delicious!! Husband had a taco and a steak quesadilla, but wasn't impressed. I think the atmosphere is so beautiful here. Definitely family friendly. Has pleasant Mexican music playing in the back ground. Definitely an authentic Mexican feel to it! Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"The service was good but the food was awful. I ordered Chile rellenos it was bland and way too greasy, it was barely edible. My boyfriend ordered nachos and they were stale and flavorless. The thing that saved the meal was the smoothie, of all things. Next time I will go to Taco Bell and save money for better food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican places. Great bean dip and awesome pollo fundido!"}
{"text":"We knew going in that it wouldn't be as good as the original, on 35th ave. However, it quickly became a disappointment. The person who seated us looked like he'd rather be anywhere but there. The gentleman we assumed to be the manager did everything possible to avoid eye contact with us. The two bright spots were Rachel, our server, and my pollo fundito. Both were outstanding. I felt so bad for our server. She was literally running from table to table, and then behind the bar, as she was responsible to tend bar as well. They appeared understaffed, but Rachel appeared to have been the only one working. I don't plan to rerun to this location, and I hope they treat Rachel well, or she finds a restaurant that will."}
{"text":"The sewage smell was awful. We got sat in a booth which was awesome for the kids. Once we sat down we could smell a very foul odor and thought it might have been the newborn next to us. The odor continued to get worse and worse Evan once the newborn left. We eventually found out from the staff they had a sewage problem and they have not fixed. The smell ruined our dinner. The worst part is the staff knew about it and continued to seat people in the section. The staffs solution was to open a door in winter. I just found it strange the restaurants solution to the problem was to open the door in the middle of winter!!!    The food was good and waitress was good. The problem"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food tonight! Came in with a group of 11, waited all of 5 minutes to get seated. Apps are great and our group enjoyed the service"}
{"text":"Is happy hour over when you take time to eat your food but you got there 2hours then you exit 2minutes after then they charge you full price wat's up with that"}
{"text":"For starters, great food, great service, friendly staff! From start to finish service was excellent! We came to celebrate my grandmothers 90th birthday and we were well taken care of. Our table was never short of drinks, chips and salsa, and anything additional we may have needed. The bean dip that accompanies the chips and salsa is just fantastic. The flavor and creaminess of the refried beans is just perfect. Everyone in our group ordered a different dish, I opted for the Tampico chicken. All I can say is it was ooey gooey cheese heaven. The taco salad my boyfriend ordered was just as amazing. For being a chain restaurant, I was highly impressed. I look forward to my next visit and consuming more delicious entrees!"}
{"text":"Garcia's took 9 minutes to ask for my drink after sitting me down. After that everything was excellent. Enchiladas tasted just how I like them . Chips and salsa were outstanding and service was excellent. I was in a hurry and was in and out pretty quickly."}
{"text":"My food was extremely spicy so I couldn't tell you if it was delicious or not. It was just extremely spicy! But that's my preference, of course. I understand some people love the spice. Before that, our server brought out chips, salsa and a bean dip. That was really good and unique since most restaurants usually just serve salsa. We ordered a round of margaritas too. Which were basically all tequila. WIN.   This place is definitely your standard mall Mexican restaurant. Really great prices! Be sure to go during happy hour, even greater prices! It's a really good family restaurant too. So if you're at Arizona Mills and looking for a place you and you're family can sit and eat, away from the standard food court, try this place. The servers are nice and super helpful despite the fact that it seemed like they were a little under staffed the day I went. Good place! I'd try it again!"}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere close to the airport to have Mexican food. Found Garcia's on Yelp and decided to give it a try. They have fantastic chicken tortilla soup, wish I had gotten the bigger size. The enchiladas were also delicious. Love the warm chips served with fresh salsa and bean dip neither is too spicy. Only thing our waiter Xander was okay. Wouldn't want him again. We will be back."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for inexpensive, greasy {but the good kind} Mexican food, come to Garcia's! It is family-owned and has been in the Valley forever. I've been coming since I was a little girl and have visited their various locations throughout the Valley. My favorite thing about Garcia's is their salsa and that they serve warm bean dip to everyone with the chips and salsa! The bean dip is SO tasty!!   They have a ton of daily specials, lunch combos for under $10, happy hour, dinners for two, etc. These make it affordable and worth the stop in.  We went to this location for lunch today {I literally haven't been in 15+ years!} and had REALLY great service! I ordered the taco salad + tortilla soup lunch combo and it was tasty! I loved that they serve the salad with a salsa ranch rather than just the typical salsa, guac, sour cream.   Also - check in on Yelp for a free cheese crisp with the purchase of 2 entrees! SO YUM! It was perfectly crisp and not too greasy at all. We would come back just for this and the margaritas!  Since it is in the hood - i'm sure we'll stop in again to take advantage of some of their great daily deals!"}
{"text":"From a gluten free perspective, they really could do better, especially since they are a mexican restaurant, it should be easier to have gluten free options.  They do have a gluten free menu but there are only about 5 or 6  things on it.  One was a machaca bowl and one a chicken bowl.  I asked if there is rice in the bowl and the waitress said no, the rice contains wheat.  So, I'm not sure what was in the bowl other than meat.  The other things on the GF menu included veggie fajitas or shrimp fajitas minus the corn tortilla (the waitress told me the corn tortillas have wheat but they were on the GF menu).  I ordered the ultimate nachos (which weren't even on the GF menu) and they were good.  I excluded a couple of items that might have gluten.  I did not get sick.  The waitress did not speak very good english, so it was a risk eating anything there."}
{"text":"I work in Arizona mills so my co workers and I often order chips and salsa to go from this location and I must say every time we get our food( which takes about 30 min) the beans are already cold, the male bartender who handles the to go orders is incredibly unfriendly, rude, and overall deplorable in his customer service abilities. Not even a kind smile as I approached the bar to receive my food. He then tried to charge me triple the price I was given over the phone. After finally fetching the \"manager\" which took some major demanding on my part, he was rude as well and insisted I, the customer, was wrong!! He did me a \"favor\" by allowing me to purchase my food at the price I was told over the phone pffft!!!! Needless to say I will never never never set foot let alone give money to this establishment ever again. TERRIBLE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was even better! We had a party of 11 and our server was able to remember EVERY SINGLE ORDER without writing it down and it all came out perfectly! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Happy hour with the girls. Great margaritas! Had chicken and beef street tacos and the most amazing steak quesadilla! Yes, we were hungry!! Chips, a variety of salsas and bean dip were very good. We did arrive at beginning of happy hour. Not many there. Server kinda distracted, perhaps. Not nice to keep running out of salsa. But overall good experience for the price."}
{"text":"First time at Garcia's today. Came to Arizona Mills for a haircut and stopped for lunch.  It was as really hopping inside, just after noon on a Saturday.   We each ordered combo plates and no drink and it still came to $30. Pretty steep for a lunch.   No issues with the food at all. It was typical Tex-Mex from a chain. The service was nearly nonexistent. After lunch arrived, she came by once more with the check. Guess she wanted us to order drinks?  Probably no return in my future."}
{"text":"Cute but typical Mexican Restaurant decor. Service was friendly but slow in a relatively empty restaurant. Food was good but uninspired. I wouldn't seek it out, but wouldn't balk at going back."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! The food is always HOT and fresh and FAST! The chips are always filled and my glass is never empty; usually. Best and closest food we can get to Southern California GOOD Mexican food.  There has only been two times when we have been here and the service was horrible; and we reflected that in the tip we left. This may sound bad but it's the truth and the observation of not only myself, but my family and friends as well. The Hispanic women bust their butts and the white girls do not. When we go now, we ask for certain servers and stay clear of the other ones that were lazy and not friendly."}
{"text":"A great patio bar with full service. Gotta love their huge margaritas, they rock. I love the patio after a nice long ride on the Harley. Cooling misters, fantastic service, ice cold beverages, all the food is wonderful, and those that like a smoke can indulged on the patio. Can park your bike right next to the patio and walk in - no need to enter the main restaurant.. I have been going there for a very long time and it is still a top place relax, get a an awesome margarita and some super food. I rate the waitress' 10 of 10."}
{"text":"I just came from a late dinner and yes i have 30 minutes before this location closed but really i had to stuff the food down and i was not greated with a good bye or thank you for coming what happened to let me finish a meal i paid for $13.35 and tipped 5.00 i was just not happy at all :("}
{"text":"The party platters were PERFECT, the food was good, everything was done on time, order was correct and the entire process went smoothly helping make our event AWESOME. Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the better ones that I have been to.  Had the combo with a sour cream chicken enchilada and a green chili burrito.  Will definitely have this again when we are back at this mall."}
{"text":"Hideous! The best part was the 22oz Dos Equis. The plates were bigger than our heads and completely devoid of flavor. Definitely a no go ever again."}
{"text":"Went there this weekend for my sons birthday dinner after shopping. Chips, salsa and bean dip were good as always and they kept them coming. I ordered the pollo fundido, and made a request for extra jalapeño cream cheese sauce as the photo looked as if there wasn't going to be enough to my liking. It came with little to no sauce so I asked the MANAGER to bring more and I was happy to pay the difference. HE brought me cold pasty cream cheese and expected me to put the cold chunky sauce on my hot food. This is \"your MANAGER\" Garcia's! Big thumbs down for lack of awareness. Poor choice for a birthday dinner. Won't be inconvenienced by shopping near dinnertime again. Service was eh...."}
{"text":"I am upgrading this to 5 stars are it has gotten even better since it opened.  The staff is on top of everything.    The food is good, albeit not as authentic as I would like, but still good nonetheless.    Only complaint is that the sopapillas have too much cinnamon sugar.  The cinnamon sugar should be an option, as I would prefer them plain."}
{"text":"You can't beat the Kids Eat Free on Sundays.  I can bring my three kids and they have lunch (more than they can eat) and a drink. My husband and I order off the lunch menu- a combo with rice and beans and with tax the bill comes to $18.  The problem is the yucky water- so any drink I try... water obviously or iced tea or soda tastes moldy/bad.  The free chips with salsa and bean dip is my favorite part.   Spinach Enchilada- good Chile Relleno- okay Charro Beans- okay Spanish Rice- yucky (though really it has to be awesome for me to like it at all)  If I didn't have 3 kids eating free I wouldn't eat here."}
{"text":"Went to Garcia's tonite and stood at the hostess station with no acknowledgement from the staff. I was there with my niece for her bday dinner and we ended up leaving before we were even seated. I had two servers and the bartender stare right at us and look away more than once. After standing there for several minutes we left. What a huge disappointment!!!Will never go here again. Poor management, poor staff, I can only imagine what the service would be like."}
{"text":"I normally don't review anything on Yelp, but this restaurant is embarrassing! I do not recommend going here at all. The staff is rude- the hostess, the waitress, and the manager. The food is decent, but there are MUCH BETTER places in Phoenix. I would actually love to be reached out to by someone in regards to my experience? We waited FOREVER for our food (and they weren't even busy!), we were given TWO plates that we DID NOT ORDER, and we had to walk up to the hostess table to pay our check. I'm sorry, but what?? Ridiculous, embarrassing, will never ever come back."}
{"text":"Our server was Kevin. Best.  Server. Ever. He was attentive and not fake professional. Loved it. Food was good too!  Overall it was a very pleasant experience. Thanks again, Kevin! You rock!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean, and the atmosphere is nice.  The waitstaff was attentive and pleasant.  The food was very average, like what you would expect from a decent hospital cafeteria.  The salsa was average.  The chips were average.  The chimichanga lacked flavor, wasn't crispy at all, and was in a word, average.  It wasn't bad; it just wasn't particularly good.  The tacos were average.  The beans were average.  The rice was average.  Nothing was bad; everything was just average.  I waited quite awhile to go here after it opened, even though I live less than a 3-minute drive away.  I wanted to give them a chance to work the bugs out and fix any issues that they may have encountered in their first few months.  So, I gave it a try.  Now that I have that out of my system, I don't have to drive by wondering if the food is excellent and I am missing out.  Now I know what I suspected from the beginning; it's just average.  The good service earned them the three-star rating, but the food was so lackluster that I really can't recommend this place.  Life is too short to settle for average.  Unless they do something wonderful to spice up their offerings, I won't be returning.  Oh well, I had a nice time anyway."}
{"text":"Second time we've been here, and the experience was the same, the food was great,  the only issue we had this time was the waitress, she disappeared for long periods of time, we actually had to go and ask to have to go boxes and check brought to us."}
{"text":"Overall decent food. Nothing to spectacular but not bad. Chips came with salsa and retried beans which was a nice addition. Our server was good."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was slow.  It was busy so not busting them too badly but they were slow."}
{"text":"Nice place for lunch or dinner. Good service but was kind of slow. Didn't have any issues with the food. I love Mexican food anyway. Will go back."}
{"text":"Garcia's came highly recommended from a friend.  Service was a little slow but we didn't mind as we really had no where to be - just my wife and I enjoying our first night in Phoenix.   The food was quite good. The house margarita was fantastic. The dessert was very tasty, although unnecessary as my dinner and the free chips and salsa prior had pretty much bloated me.   Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place has decent rustic Mexican food at an affordable price but the main attraction for me is the bean dip. I love it when a restaurant serves bean dip and unfortunately, not enough of them do! Although its not as good as Serranos bean dip, its still tasty and so are the chips and salsa that accompany it. The actual meals are a bit mediocre though... think McCayos where its not terrific but hits the spot when you want a nice greasy Mexican chain food meal."}
{"text":"My waitress was absolutely amazing! I can't remember her name but she was so friendly and funny and she made my day great! Plus the chips and salsa is great! And the food is amazing! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"We arrived mid-day looking forward to using our $5-off coupon and having a terrific meal.  One of two waiters we had was \"in training,\" but service was pretty much okay nonetheless . . .   At some point after the food was served, the $5-off coupon disappeared from the table.  After we were finished eating and had requested boxes to go, the waiter asked if we wanted dessert.  My husband and I both said \"no,\" to which the waiter replied, \"I thought that's why you wanted the go-boxes.\"  We said \"no\" again. ODD.  I had taken my credit card out of my wallet and placed it on top.  The \"in training\" waiter came to the table, and said, \"Can I take that for you?\"  I replied, \"Not until I've seen the bill!\"  WHAT THE ? ? ?  Being asked to pay without seeing the bill???  WHAT KIND OF PLACE DOESN'T PRESENT THE BILL BEFORE TAKING PAYMENT??\"   EVEN ODDER!  Well, the waiter in-training went off to fetch the bill, and the waiter who was doing the training came to the table and asked if HE could take my credit card!!  I told him that the other waiter had gone to get the bill . . .  FINALLY the bill was presented, and ~ surprise, surprise! ~ the $5 off was NOT deducted!  I called this to their attention, and they reprinted the bill reflecting the $5 off.  THE ODDEST!!  Unfortunately, the last several minutes spent as they were in this restaurant seemed to set the tone for the entire dining experience, and gave us both a rather creepy feeling.   My husband and I have agreed that we will not return to this Garcia's Mexican Restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the free chips and bean dip! The happy hour is from 3-7 with amazing deals on their food and drinks. Service is always good and the place is never too busy. It's a great place for a meal with your date or a quick drink with friends! I would recommend the pollo fundido (chimichanga with cream cheese and melted cheese) delicious! I love how they have San Tan Devils Ale on tap so youre not forced to stick with a margarita because it's a mexican joint."}
{"text":"We just had the nachos. They were great. The waiter started with an attitude but he must have realized and got better. We will be back."}
{"text":"My wife must have been on Santa's Naughty List, because this place's fish tacos gave her food poisoning on Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"My son just moved to Phoenix and I came in from Las Vegas to visit.  We decided to go out and try and find some good mexican food and his neighbor suggested Garcia's.  When we arrived and got off the car, I was impressed, the smells coming from the building were amazing.  As we walked in, the restaurant is nicely decorated, there was mexican music playing and we were seated almost immediately.  We started with an appetizer while we looked over the menu.  We ordered fajitas and a combination plate for our entrees.  When the entrees came, the waitress, holding the plates says to us, \"move those plates (I think she was referring to the appetizer plates)\" we did and she placed our food in front of us.  The appetizer plates were empty but she did not take them away.  Also, our tea and diet coke glasses were empty and she did not offer to refill them.  We tried to get her attention but it truly felt like she was ignoring us.  Finally, my son got up and went to the bar to get our refills, at the bar, the waitress was standing there speaking with another employee and saw that we had to get our own refills.  The food I have to say was very good, it arrived hot and served beautifully.  When finished, we stacked the plates with the appetizer plates and still she would not pick up the dirty dishes.  She brought us the check and we advised her that we wanted to look at the dessert menu to which she replied, \" I don't need to get  you a menu, I will tell you what we have\",  I told her that sometimes, the picture or description of the dessert helps me decide but she refused to bring the menu.  She rattled on several items and we decided on the chocolate mini chimis.  Again, once done, we placed the dessert plates on top of the plates that were now a mountain of dirty dishes.  She never picked up the plates but rather a gentleman that might have been a manager did.  He did not introduce himself but did pick up the plates. While eating, I have to say, the staff started cleaning up and putting up the chairs! I understand it might have been a slow day but really? wait for the diners to leave or start cleaning the areas where there were no diners.  We felt they were telling us to leave, which we did.  To management I have to say, whoever your cook is, my compliments to him/her, I am Hispanic and the food was absolutely delicious.  The service provided by your waitress, non-existent!  Next trip I feel like the taste of the food will bring me back but I hesitate with the service that was given us."}
{"text":"When I first moved to the valley nearly ten years ago, I remember that Garcia's Mexican Restaurants were still considered to be among the finest. Their reputation even preceded my move because I was aware of Garcia's when I was still in Tucson.  I've heard from friends and strangers alike that this (small) chain was not as good as it once was. I usually take naysayers with a grain of salt. Until I've had a bad experience or meal, I know what I like. While Garcia's may not be the best or most original Mexican restaurant I've dined at, it's never failed to satisfy.  The Thomas Road location is close to work so I've enjoyed enough lunches here over the last few years. Today, a co-worker chose Garcia's from a short list of suggestions to go celebrate his birthday. He got no argument from me.  I like the look of this location. It's a good example of \"subdued\" Mexican style. It's classy, comfortable and always clean. We were seated as soon as we stepped in and were greeted by Lauren (our server) right away. She did a wonderful job too. As soon as our drinks were dropped off, she took our orders. And the food was delivered to the table in less than ten minutes!  True to form, our meal was relaxing and delicious. Even the lunch specials had generous portions. And I had forgotten how amazing their Mexican rice is. Garcia's wonderful reputation is alive and kicking!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch. They had a nice bean dip with several choices of salsa and hot salted corn chips fresh out of the over. The lunch prices are nice the portions are too."}
{"text":"Darcy the Manager and Marisa one of the Servers are outstanding.   They both set the bar high for restaurant customer service.  The Mexican dishes are excellent and a great value.  There are many Mexican restaurants in the Valley but if you're wanting to be treated like family and enjoy a truly  authentic  South of the Border dining experience, I highly recommend Garcia's at Arizona Mills !!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go to this Garcia's about once a week. The previous reviewer mentioned the food is spicy. I don't know what the food in VA is like, but Garcia's is extremely mild in my opinion. I grew up in Cali and have lived in AZ for the past 8 years so I grew up on Mexican food and love spicy foods. The salsa is extremely mild, much more sweet than spicy. And the bean dip? Very tasty but certainly not spicy. As far as Mexican food goes, Garcia's is right there alongside most Mexican restaurant chains. The reason I love them so much is their fajitas!! The marinade they use for the chicken is the best I have ever tasted. It is really the only thing I ever order there anymore. Another great thing about Garcia's is they have 2 \"healthy\" dishes available for people who are watching their waistlines. I have had both (Grilled Chicken Flautas and a Chicken and Spinach Quesadilla) and both are pretty good for lower calorie fair.  I would certainly recommend this Garcia's. Service is almost always good, it's never too crowded and the food is not bad and very affordable."}
{"text":"Food was decent.   Nothing special.   Hostess was rude and not helpful.    I told her that I was not happy with the answers.   She turned her back and walked away shrugging her shoulders.   Waitress forgot to bring the menus.  Waitress took only part of the drink orders and left the table.  I had to ask manager to take the balance of the drink orders."}
{"text":"My husband ordered the nacho plate with carne asada and there was hardly any meat and it was so dry. Our waiter to me personally was very arrogant and was way to confident like thought he was all that and the way he spoke to us and my daughter's was super sarcastic and rude. I ordered can't remember what it was but it came with shrimp and steak on a small sizzling plate and it was okay not really that great of a taste. I really don't recommend this place its not even Mexican lol and its super expensive for the poor food they offer."}
{"text":"First let me say the chips are very good, and the bean dip is excellent, BUT for the most part the rest of the menu is mostly bland.  They make a very good red chilie burro, and chile Colorado, but everything else is meh!  Cheese enchilads? meh. Tacos? meh. steak? meh. fajitas? meh.  Polo fundido is good, my wife orders it almost every time.  One note for this and other Mexican restaurants. Why are people charged more when you order something with out rice and beans? Most of the time the amount of food minus the rice and beans is way more than enough. I can't tell you how many times I see plates with rice and beans left on them. They just get thrown away."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many many times. I love Mexican food. Garcia's has a reputation slightly ahead of let's say, Manuel's or Pancho's, right? I love that they give you bean dip with your nachos and chunky salsa. I love that you can sit by the window and people watch while you eat. It IS loud in here, only because the mall is right outside. You can order a la carte and it's super cheap. So why am I giving it three stars? The last time I went with my husband and family and for some reason, I'm the only one in the group who got a minor case of food poisoning. When I get food poisoning, I'm gonna yelp about it. I was the only one who had chicken tortilla soup. I had to sit down on the bench outside the restaurant for ten minutes for fear it would come up. My skin felt like it was on fire. That's the only time it happened but since I've eaten there before just fine and love the atmosphere, I'm willing to return."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food.. I had the steak and shrimp and the steak was cooked as I asked, so no complaints."}
{"text":"I got you spinach quesadilla they came with vegetables and beans it was an overall good meal I enjoyed the quesadilla and beans .the vegetables weren't quite as cooked but still very good for its price!"}
{"text":"Went here last night to celebrate. We waited about 10 minutes for our table; which was great. However, once they sat us at our table and left chips we sat there for about an hour with no service. Numerous employees walked by and not once did they ask us if we needed anything. Very disappointed. I highly recommend going to a different location."}
{"text":"Good food not the best but not frozen like some of the other Mexican places I tried..Also I lost my phone to my surprise it was their thank u don't know his name but he is a male waiter during the day that found it its good to know trusted ppl are handling Your food and you..."}
{"text":"A lunch companion and I visited Garcias this afternoon for a quick lunch.  As we entered the restaurant  we were greeted and seated immediately. The decor in Garcias is warm and inviting with its Spanish architecture, paint, tiles and Mexican music in the background.   As we were seated our chips, salsa,  and drinks arrived almost immediately.  The chips are served hot with chunky red salsa and a refried bean dip. The chips are hot, very thin, crispy and salted perfectly and the bean dip is delicious.  The menu at Garcias has a good variety of entrees, all reasonably priced for a full service establishment. The staff at Garcias are friendly without being intrusive.  The food is delivered quickly, hot, and plated attractively with generous servings.   My lunch companion and I both ordered from the lunch special, Mexican pizza,  two beef flatas, rice, and beans, the typical Mexican fare.  The flayas, and rice were good as were the chips and salsa. However, the Mexican pizza, wasn't very good.  The pizza was over cooked, and not very flavorful."}
{"text":"Garcia's is a place my fiancé and I visit at least once a month. The food is always great and never disappoints! I tend to gravitate towards the beef street tacos. My fiancé the chicken fajitas. Their complimentary chips and salsa are to die for. This last time we went we tried the fried ice cream and it was the best I have ever tasted! You can not go wrong by coming here."}
{"text":"I ate here a year ago and me and my husband both got food poisoning so bad we thought we was going to die so after year I decided to go back and try it again this time they decided to give me raw meat inside of my enchilada and the manager didn't even come to my table to look at the food she had the waitress let me know that it was just over cooked and that's why it was pink and bloody yeah alright I will never go here again"}
{"text":"I love Garcia's. Their food is delicious, especially the cheese enchiladas, refried beans, and poco chicken chimis. Service was great on this visit, but can be hit or miss sometimes."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner tonight at garcia's.  I have been here a few times recently and it is looking a little weathered.  Tonight we arrived and waiting in the entrance I noticed that no one bothered to greet me.  When it time to be seated they took me to my booth which sad a pretty loud section. After being left at the table we waited a few minutes but noone showed up to get our drink order.  At some point someone brought us chips.  We waited,  decided on our order, chatted and ate chips.  While we waited saw other people getting served.  Eventually after about fifteen minutes and most of the chips,  we decided to leave.  On the way out someone tried to take our order but we went to  Serrano instead."}
{"text":"Found this gem when the other mexican restaurant down the street was closed. We got soft drinks and chips with salsa & AMAZING bean dip to start out with. As an app we ordered the Cheese Crisp and got the beef Chimichanga! Our server was hysterical and checked on us frequently. This was a great place and I would love to go back!"}
{"text":"The bean dip and salsa are out of this world good! I also got the taco salad & tortilla soup duo- both were fabulous! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had a really nice time with the family at Garcia's in the middle of the Xmas-NYE Holiday week. I had heard from the local's the Nation's cold weather was causing the snowbirds to arrive early. It was quite busy, as the whole town was. Visiting from LA myself... I was appreciative of a comfortable and happy waiting area. My husband and I ventured into their bar and grabbed a drink. I peeked out at an adorable Patio Al Fresco area. Our table was ready soon, maybe took about 15-20 minutes with no reservation for a party of 5 on a Saturday night.   Back inside we were seated in a corner booth and I used my Yelp check-in offer to surprise the whole-table with a  free cheese-crisp! Haha I'm awesome. ;) Thanks Garcia's! Thanks Yelp!  Then we ate it and enjoyed it with Salsa, so tasty. We ordered 5 entrees and I'd say they came in a good amount of time. My salad was Huge! HUGE! It was a fajita salad and it was so good. The carne asada was delicious."}
{"text":"We had the lunch specials and our waitress was very friendly and so was the hostess. You can park around the West end of the mall where it says Garcia's and stroll right in. We had Spinach enchiladas and they were so tasty, and even delicious the next day for my leftovers. The salsa is very tasty and chunky and of course delicious chips. They brought refills on that quickly and gave us our own dips and extra salsa. My coworker had the Poblano sauce chicken enchiladas which looked like it had a lot of chicken in it and my other coworker had a burrito and I didnt hear any complaints about that. We were all gabbing and eating so we really didnt discuss the food extensively but I definitely thought the spinach enchys' were great."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour til 7 in the bar. Half priced appetizers and drinks and free chips and salsa. A great recipe for a great night out."}
{"text":"My family and I had lunch here on a Saturday.  We tried to find it with Siri on the iphone but she had us circling the mall until we finally saw the sign.  The reason Siri was confused is probably because it is inside the mall though on the outer edge on the west side.  The entrance is opposite the Rainforest Cafe in the mall.  We were seated promptly and the service was good up until the end when we needed the check.  We started with a cheese crisp thanks to Yelp checkin.  It was very cheesy and good.  The chips had come with a bean dip or salsa and both were nice with the crisp.  I had the chicken quesadilla salad.  It came with ranch dressing and had quacamole and pineapple salsa as well as a cheese quesadilla.  It was tasty and particularly liked the pineapple salsa.  The others liked their meal ok as well."}
{"text":"My recent visit was much better than the first. Our waitress Kayla was excellent. She had numerous tables and was very patient and nice. She worked her butt off so I tipped 25%. I had a bad first trip to Garcia's and the general manager sent me a gift and invited me back. Definitely going back again. Food was delicious and the house salsa was perfect. Thank you for a good night and nice meal."}
{"text":"I love any chance I get to go to Garcias...The only thing I have trouble with is the menu....that's because everything is so delicious and I can't choose....plus the free bean dip is just another plus"}
{"text":"Our second visit we had a helpful, cheerful waitress, unlike our first visit.  We returned because we loved the food and location"}
{"text":"Food was good but a little slow today. Biggest disappointment was that we asked for patio seating not realizing that smoking was allowed. Ruined lunch for us. We had been there before and enjoyed the outdoor experience so brought an out of town friend who happened to be allergic to the cigarette smoke. Our plans to impress her were blown away."}
{"text":"Do you remember when you didn't think El Torito was bad?  This was way back when it might not have been bad, before it was a big bad chain that had watered and fajitaed everything down to the lowest common gringo denominator--and yes, El Torito is Mexican food for gringos.  When's the last time you saw a Mexican family enjoying their dinner at El Torito, hm?  Garcia's reminds me of Mexican food in the '80s.  No, it's not El Torito; it's actually much better and more authentic than El Torito, even early El Torito.  Everything here reminds me of childhood:  the food, the fresh chips, the darkness, the decor, the servers' outfits, my mother's insistence on ordering fajitas.  I get the sense that there are various locations in Phoenix and that back in the day Garcia's might have been on the verge of expanding beyond Arizona and becoming the next El Torito.  Thankfully, it didn't.  Thankfully, nothing changed, ever.  I was thirty-seven-years-old sitting across the tiled tabletop from my parents, but I might as well have been seven, and maybe my brother and sister were just in the bathroom or sitting with our cousins at another table.  No one sang \"Happy Birthday to You,\" but people--my parents?--did order margaritas, and there were Latino-looking families enjoying themselves here.  Maybe it is watered and gringoed down.  But I don't think so.  It's more like a time machine that deposits you directly in 1984."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, hot, and timely.    Our waiter was in a rather good mood, which made our visit more interesting, and very helpful."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I came here for our lunch break. It took F O R E V E R to order and receive our food. Then it took an eternity for the waiter to bring our check. Took an hour and a half to get in & out on our lunch break. I ordered the steak quesadilla. Not bad if you like mostly peppers & onions. I had 2 slices of the quesadilla. Of the 2 slices I had, one piece of steak in each slice. I opened the rest of the quesadilla up to look at it. Maybe, MAYBE 8 pieces of meat in the whole quesadiila. Only one of us enjoyed our food. That was Lee. She ordered a cheese crisp with taco meat. I have to say it looked good. However, we all agreed we will never come back here for lunch....or dinner."}
{"text":"Really liked Garcia's. Delicious and filling. Most prices are $9-12. I had the Buritto Grande and wife had sampler plate."}
{"text":"Garcia's earns 1 star  because there was one person at the table who enjoyed the meal. Garcia's is definitely not gluten free friendly inspite of the so-called gluten free menu which I can almost recall by heart it is so short. Chicken Gasedo  (shredded chicken in soup bowl one of my tablemates called chicken slop) Beef Machaco, see chicken description, Veggies, Salsa, Black beans or charro beans, house salad with vinegar and oil. So for $9.99 I got a bowl of chicken slop and a cup of black beans. I thought when I got the bill I would be charged ala carte for both items but I wasn't. So don't know if the waiter didn't charge me or what. Word to the wise at Garcia's, add some corn tortillas, maybe keep a bag of tostitos in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I haven't need to Garcia's in a long time, my wife suggested it and I am glad we came. The service was good and the food came out fast, the only problem I had is I thought the Fish Tacos were a bit skimpy on the fish. I like how they give you warm chips as soon as you sit down along with great salsa and bean dip!"}
{"text":"Had a delicious taco salad, prepared just the way I requested. Service was friendly and good. Prices are reasonable and it's a great location."}
{"text":"2 words: Food poisoning.   My stepdad and I both got food poisoning from Garcia's...not pleasant."}
{"text":"This was a fav growing up.  Had lunch here a few weeks back.  Regretfully, the food was a-ok at best.  Sides were cold.  Brought this to the attention of the server and sides were replaced.  Experience was good except I sat near the front door which lets in a tooooon of hot or cold air.  On my visit it was cold outside so it was chilly by the door."}
{"text":"WOW!! I love Mexican food well I just love good food period! and I must say I was totally impressed plus kids ate free that day I went!! the portions and Big the prices were low and the staff was friendly and polite.  I will say that this is by far the best restaurant I have found that offered a complete package.  Also, the restrooms were clean and smelling fresh a must where my family and I eat.  Bar was \"OFF THE MEAT RACK!\"   I LOVE THIS PLACE! every time we go to the mall, we will have lunch or dinner here.  A+++"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here! Whether it's for lunch or dinner, the food is always hot and cooked to perfection. I love the atmosphere and the service is always impeccable. I have never had to ask for my drink to be re-filled, and the chips and salsa were always coming out of the kitchen. It reminds me of home and growing up in California with some of the most delicious Mexican food restaurants I've been to. I will definitely be coming here and bringing all of my friends!"}
{"text":"We had actually came here to go to the rainforest to treat my son for a good game he had just had. After waiting in line for tables you could clearing see opened and bad service we decided to leave and come to Garcia's. I'm so glad we did so. I must say our server Amadeo was the BEST. Very friendly,  attentive and detailed. He is what made this experience impressing. The restaurant was busy but it didn't take away from the Quality of the food which was amazing or lack of service. It was clean a little crammed but I will most definitely be back. Thanks Amadeo for the great experience."}
{"text":"Went back again and ordered the pollo fundido. I would get it again. Probably more my fault for ordering something I wouldn't have liked. Too heavy and greasy. Will still come back but won't get any of the fried items  Tortilla soup we good and had big chunks of avocado."}
{"text":"I think this place has great food! The tortilla soup is perfect when you don't feel great and I love the spicy bean dip they serve with the chips."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Garcia's in years. I was pleasantly surprised.  The warm chips and bean dip was delicious and I had steak picada, which was perfectly cooked. The server was friendly and helpful and quick. She kept our drinks full, made suggestions and was just great."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying it is hard to find a decent place to dine on this side of Mesa. Garcia's has been my go to when my boyfriend and I have had a long day at work and are in the mood for Mexican food. It is super close to my house and the margaritas are perfect! I like that they automatically bring you chips salsa and bean dip, which is very tasty especially after a long day of working outside! The food is good and the restaurant is always clean and nice inside. However it seems like they really need some quality servers. The servers they have seem to be a bit young and inexperienced, which I get! Everyone starts somewhere. I think it would greatly benefit them to do some training with there guys that are directly helping the customers that dine and spend their money here. I will return to Garcia's I just hope that they can work on training their guys and gals to provide excellent customer service to accompany their wonderful restaurant.   I will update my review the next time I dine here as I know how important these things can be for a business. Hope to have a better experience next time."}
{"text":"I've had margaritas at hundreds of restaurants, and the house margarita at Garcia's was by far the WORST one I've ever had.  So bad, in fact, that I didn't even finish it.....and that's never happened before.  It tasted more like a lime popsicle....that supposedly had tequila in it.  The spinach queso was good, as well as the chips.  Salsa was mild.....bland.  It took our waiter well over 5 minutes to take our drink order, but service improved after that.  All in all, probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Three of us walked in for a lunch. We ordered our meals. The order came with vegetables. The food came quick enough but the vegetables had a bad odor and looked liked it had been sitting around for days. We politely asked for new plates.  I've been to many Mexican food restaurants with much better food and better presentation.   What a disappointment."}
{"text":"Good service, went in for lunch. Mall restaurant. Food was okay"}
{"text":"Excellent food great service and did I mention the great food ? But seriously the food was amazing and the prices where even better, I got so much food for a mere 12 dollars and quality food don't get me started on there bean dip it's amazing combined with the salsa and chips well you should stop reading this and head over there for some dinner you'll see I didn't embellish not a single word"}
{"text":"Meh. There are way better options such as \"Mi Amigos\" or even \"Serrano's.\". The salsa taste very Americanized like paste from a jar. The chicken salad is something you could easily make at home, you could see it was not fresh salad. The steak is on Applebee's level... poor. But I was hungry and it did fill me up so it is food."}
{"text":"Used to like this location.  Green corn tamales are good.  Service and food have gone down hill.  I am going to skip this location, going forward."}
{"text":"Came to Garcia's tonight after a few year hiatus,  just because it's a little out-of-the-way for us. It was a small wait, so it would have been nice to have somewhere to sit to wait....  It seems that the seats in our particular booth were extremely low to the table. I had to make an effort to sit more upright as I spilled my drink on myself. I am short so....  The complimentary chips and salsa were delicious, and irresistible! The entrees alright, wish I would have checked yelp first for the check in bonus.  However I did run into some issues during my visit. Once was my observance of a server texting in the bathroom for a least five minutes, one hates to hope it was a family emergency but that seems to be an extremely inappropriate thing to do at work. I felt sorry for her tables who might have needed her attention.  Second I had an issue with my food and I really didn't appreciate how my server began to handle it by examining my plate at many angles making me feel like I was being judged. It almost made me feel stupid for mentioning it so I instead just ask to speak to the manager, because I just didn't like her disposition on the matter and the vibe I was feeling.  Issue was dealt with politely and appropriately by manager and I appreciate his understanding and friendly attitude .  I would return for a weekday when they are maybe not so busy, for more attentive service and maybe more attentive plating."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood go to place for a quick margarita and food and today didn't  disappoint.  Quick service from bartender. Chips salsa and bean dip within 3 minutes. Ordered a burro ala carte with green sauce, it came out super fast and super hot. Delicious. Not a single issue. Only reason they received 4 stars instead of 5 is because of prior experience. I have to hope Yelp is responsible for the improved EVERYTHING. Thanks, Garcias for getting back on your game!    PRIOR VISIT:   Gotta say re-cheesing is bad!  We ordered drinks after a pretty long wait, then ordered 'ultimate nachos with steak' when we were able to flag down our waiter. One hour after we arrived no nachos. We flagged down the chip delivery guy and told him our quandary. Not 3 minutes later our nachos arrived. Softly melted cheese, cold sour cream Guacamole. Thinking we scored a great plate of nachos we dug in. Underneath the beautiful cheese was petrified cheese fused to both the chips and the plate. Knowing now that when faced with a super late order the kitchen was willing to try and fake us out with a scraped off and re-cheesed plate of nachos completely erodes my confidence in the establishment."}
{"text":"Great salsas and bean dip.  If you like salsa be sure to ask for the roasted and hot options they have upon request.  The food was fresh and the service was great.  Very great price points and good happy hour.    I think most of the comments and ratings were given during opening weekend when that has to be expected at a new restaurant.  Definitely give it a try.  Like the other review pointed out, this place is much much better than Tee Pee."}
{"text":"The staff was very nice... The food was the worst thing ever! I ordered the Chimichanga lunch with red chile and charro beans. Chimi was soggy, and covered with onions and like 5 tomatoes, I think there was cheese on it too but it was really hard to tell and when I cut it open the meat smelled like dog food. The beans tasted spoied and the rice was cold clumpy and hard... It was seriously the WORST thing I've ever had... This was my first and last visit!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are regulars at Garcia's. We eat here almost every other day. The food is great and the staff treats you like family.best happy hour prices!!"}
{"text":"It's OKAY. I don't go here regularly actually I only come here for lunch break at work. It's not too bad but not authentic. Their pollo fundido chimichanga is good rice and beans not so good. The service is not so great the food is better than the service. If I had a choice between here and else where is see what the other choice is first lol."}
{"text":"Weak happy hour margarita, ended up buying a shot of Patron' to make it yummy. Also ordered their sampler platter for $10.95 ( apps are half off during happy hour) thank goodness because if I would have paid full price for this I would have been pissed. Nothing was good at all, and it bugs the crap out  of me when Mexican restaurants add soooo much \"filler\" to  their shredded beef and chicken...you know like tons of onion, celery, peppers, and very little actual meat.   Our server was ok, but we were sitting next to the server station and all we heard were employees complaining about customers and talking shit about other employees. No bueno."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and everything was good. The pollo fundido came out hot and fresh, the tortilla soup was better than expected, and the chips and salsa did not disappoint. The only problem was that the chiles rellenos came out soggy and actually overstuffed with cheese(I know, usually a good problem). Overall, it was an enjoyable experience and our waitress was attentive and friendly, so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Mexican food, keep looking.  This place served me some of the worst Chile Colorado that I've ever had, despite the server telling me it was \"really good\".  The chips are bad (light, cheap, flavorless), the salsa is over salted and generally no better than your average grocery brand.  The Chile. . .  I don't even have the words - too salty to eat - but even barring that it was beef chunks in a brown gravy (!) with a nice film forming on it.  The flavor was shallow, dull, thick and generally poor.  I took literally one bite, asked for the check, paid and left.  The rest of the experience was fine.  Cleanliness, service, etc are certainly within acceptable margins for a chain restaurant.  Some people are passionate about food.  These people are not.  If you are, you'd be much better served at a place like Casa Ramos which is about a block away."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food is absolutely wonderful. I've had their fajitas, pollo fundidos, chimis, flautas, and tacos and none of it disappoints. The servers are polite and the overall atmosphere of the place puts me at ease with its lighting and decor. They also have really good margaritas. I wish I could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"Every time I ate at Garcia's, I got sick.  The last time I ate there, my appendix burst. No joke. A few years after my near-fatal experience, a friend of mine ate there and the next day her appendix burst!   Avoid this restaurant like the plague.   Unless you enjoy going septic, that is."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.  Their shredded beef tacos were delicious.  We also had the cheese crisp and it was very good.  Loved the bean dip they served with the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"We went to Garcia's for a dinner.  Our party was large---6 adults, 2 toddlers and a newborn.  The restaurant gladly accomodated us.  They had high chairs for the toddlers but no sling for the baby carrier.  However, that was resolved by putting the baby carrier on a chair.  The restaurant is typical of Mexican restaurants in that they bring out the tortilla chips and salsa.  What was different, however, is that in addition to the salsa, a bean dip is also brought out.  Both were quite spicy---not spicy enough to burn your mouth but still noticeable.  The portions for the main courses were huge.  I ordered a make your own combo platter with a chile relleno and a shredded beef taco.  The taco was good.  The chile relleno was unusual in that it was the spiciest one I've ever had!   Chile rellenos are--as a rule-- a mild dish.  I asked others in our party what they thought about their meals and they, too, found theirs to be spicier than usual.    Service was excellent.  The waiter was very attentive and patient.  We would go again next time we're in town but now know to expect food that's uniformly spicier than usual."}
{"text":"Gross. It was all gross. Beans from a can. Salsa from a jar. Recooked Rice from a box. And tortillas from Walmart. Tasted fake and gross. I ordered the shrimp tacos. Tasted raw and smelled fishy. I just pushed them aside and ate my side of \"charro\" beans and the rest of the table chips. So effing gross. Only thing I liked was the Bahama Mama. I feel like I'm gonna throw up."}
{"text":"I've been to this location quite a bit. I absolutely love the chips! They serve them hot with bean dip and a fresh salsa that is to die for.  I'm usually full before I even get my meal...so be careful! Last night I went with a friend and we sat in a booth at the bar.  It was actually very nice. Our waiter was on it! He was so nice and quick witted.  He brought our meal quickly and it was by far the most delicious meal I've had at  Garcia's. Order the El Pollo Fundido! Melts in your mouth!  I've been here before and wasn't as impressed.  I have had a change of heart and was very impressed this time and will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this restaurant and let me tell you I'm impressed!!!! Food is delicious!!! Customer service was great! Alfredo is a great bartender!! Drinks were generously poured! All of the staff I encountered had nice friendly, welcoming vibes!!! I know for sure I will be coming back!!!!  *UPDATE* Came back only to have great service yet again!!! Alexander was my waiter! He had a great attitude, makes great drinks and works hard to make sure everyone in the bar is satisfied!! Thanks again for another great experience at Garcias!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the El Magnifico Sampler through UberEATS and I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor of all FOUR items that came with it. The Beef Chimi was my favorite and I'll definitely be in to check out the restaurant soon. Great Job Guys!!!"}
{"text":"The service here was pretty good, however the burrito grande and my girlfriends sour cream enchilada and green corn tamale were dry and bland. We were not very impressed! We are from out of state however others in our party are locals. They stated that the food quality has gone down at this restaurant as of late."}
{"text":"Arrived just after they opened. Service was slow to say the least. Friendly when they showed up but refills or any other needs are out of the question. Food is marginal at best. Definitely not worth the effort and won't be back here."}
{"text":"Salsa was good, service was good....Food was not something I'll be writing home to tell mom about, one plus is that the chicken in my enchilada was moist, I was pleased with that, beans cold, rice clumped together & flavorless. Shredded beef tacos were flavorless, maybe we came too late at night not sure but GARCIA'S SALT & PEPPER, ONIONS, GARLIC, ETC. HAM HOCKS IN THOSE BEANS SOMETHING PLEASE!!!! Other than that you seem to have a good customer base or your sign is elusive either way good luck"}
{"text":"When it was suggested to go to Garcia's today for lunch I was a bit apprehensive, mainly based on their location. I am however glad I went, I was wrong. First and foremost, service was great. Every person working the restaurant was friendly and helpful. Fantastic team! I ordered green corn tamales and my lunch partner cheese enchiladas. I was especially appreciative as a vegetarian that our waitress let me know the rice was not vegetarian and suggested black beans. The rice is cooked in chicken stock. Our food was better than expected and filled my craving for tamales. Overall food rating 4 stars, service 5 star + so I'm giving this place a 5 star for overall experience, service and food. Will be back."}
{"text":"Typical Mexican chain restaurant. Lots of salt, cheese, and carbs (oversized burritos, chips & salsa, rice, etc.).  Too many places like this in the Valley."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food place! Great food, but the service is lacking. This place never lets me down when it comes to food."}
{"text":"We ate here last evening and there were four of us.  We all had one thing different and we can honestly say it was \" the best\" Mexican food we have ever had.   The service was excellent, too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came in here late one night, close to closing time, and we still had amazing service. We were treated like we were valuable customers, even though it was late & the staff probably wanted to go home. I got the mini chimis & my hubby got the chili relleno. I'm a Mexican food junkie & this is pretty dang good!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of Garcia's Mexican Restaurant before today.  I went there earlier with my work and with 12 of us and no reservation, we were seated quickly and were served with no issues.    They served us several bowls of chips and salsa that were incredibly delicious.  They had the typical salsa and a light brown sauce that wasn't spicy but tasted so good.    I ordered a burrito and tamale on the lunch special menu.  The price wasn't so bad, of course I wasn't paying for my food.  One thing that was a bit of a mix up was I ordered a tamale and instead got an enchilada but that's understandable since they were serving all of our party."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go via internet. Was told it would be 10-35 minutes. Got there in 35 minutes and was told it wasn't ready. Manager came out and explained the order was just received but that he would have the kitchen get the order done as soon as possible. Took another 10 minutes to get the order. Manager gave us chips, salsa and bean dip and $10 in gift certificates. Even with the delay, we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Went here with a coworker for dinner.  Wait wasn't more than 5-10 minutes which didn't bother us at all.  Chips/salsa/refried beans were great.  Chips seemed really fresh.  My coworker ordered the fish tacos which looked delicious and he liked them.  I got the chimichanga with rice and black beans.  The chimichanga was not overly fried, which I loved.  I got it with ground beef which usually isn't an option, but I really enjoyed it.  I would definitely recommend this place and will continue to try the different options when I'm back in PHX."}
{"text":"This place is like Olive Garden which is over priced, mediocre food, with good service. We had a party of 13 and our waiter was on top of it. He was pleasant to everyone and never displayed a sign of stress or frustration. The food was served hot and all employees were helpful at all times. Will I go back? Only if visiting AZ and my family insist on going there."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the first time. The service was really good, our sever was very personable. The food was okay, wish the tamales was a little more tasteful. The atmosphere is very Spanish, and spacious."}
{"text":"Yesterday had to be the WORST experience at a restaurant I have ever had! My bf and I went here for happy hr (I usually go to the AZ mills location). I love the beans that they have. Everything was fine until I'm 4 bites into the dip and find a BUG! I thought it was a piece of hair because I saw the antennae. After I looked at it closer and realized what it was, I told my bf and he start gagging and goes to the bathroom to puke because he had some too! The bartender comes back with our drinks and I have her look at it. She says \"I don't know what that is but it looks disgusting, do you still want the drinks?\" NO!!!! I will NEVER eat here again. The most DISGUSTING thing that I have ever seen at a restaurant! DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Visiting for vacation with the family and stopped by. This place is awesome friendly atentative staff and excellent food. Highly recommend the carnitas tacos."}
{"text":"As a chain restaurant, I am pretty impressed. They have a solid menu and this location has a great staff.   One recommendation i have is to skip the chips and salsa and actually order the \"Cheese Crisp.\" OMG - this is danagerous --- but worth it. It is like a huge nacho chip with cheese."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant AZ mills mall has. The food is great and the staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and attentive from the moment we walked in. Chips, salsa, and beans were a great starter and very tasty. My Enchiladas Trio hit the spot and the serving was large, leaving leftovers for later. My friend had the Ultimate Burrito and it looked incredible! Worth visiting if you're in the mood for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"Dinner was bland, no seasoning, which is weird. Even the salsa was boring, The manager was very nice."}
{"text":"My Husband and I went the first day they opened bad,  wrong food, wrong check, food not very tasty the only good thing was the chips and salsa. We have been back twice now giving it more time well we will not be going back at all. The food is not seasoned nor does it taste like mexican food today we ordered fajitas normally you smell them coming that did not happen we had steak and chicken the chicken looked like it was sliced off a chicken from the supermarket no taste the steak no take and tough.  We loved the other Garcias we were so happy one was opening in our neighborhood but after 3 trips no more for us."}
{"text":"This is another location I have visited many times and every time I received great service and ate great food without fail. The food is cheap and the atmosphere is descent. Bonus points go to the excellent Fried Ice Cream!"}
{"text":"From the Salsa to the Taco Salad - edible but very bland.  Taco Salad was served without the \"Southwestern dressing\" and even after that was brought, there was no flavor enhancement.  Ground beef in the Taco Salad didn't appear to have any seasoning.  My wife ordered Flautas and got something that appeared and tasted like frozen taquitos overly deep fried so the ends were nearly inedible.  This was supposed to be a mother's day meal for my wife and they gave us a \"free entrée up to $10\" coupon on our next visit.  We won't be going back.  The salsa they served with the chips after we were seated had huge chunks of tomato.  The best part of our meal was the service, the pepsi and the chips (without the tasteless salsa)."}
{"text":"Good food. Was here for lunch. It was slow but the service was ok and she was nice. There are lunch specials here to until 3pm. Cheese enchiladas were good. Fabulous been and salsa dip!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, but it was definitely nothing special. We got their appetizer sampler as well as street tacos. My mom always says, you get what you pay for,and in this occasion, that clique rang true. I'm not sure what kind of steak was in the tacos, but that meat was so dry and flavorless, \"fresh beef jerky\" is a more suitable way to describe it. I was thinking there would be at least 1 winner in the appetizer trio... wrong again. The rolled tacos and mini chimis taste like they came out of a frozen dinner package from the grocery store. The 2nd star was earned because the decor was at least average, the servers were attentive and their AC was nice and cool."}
{"text":"I don't get to visit the Mesa location often but it has been worth it each time I go. The food is still just as good along with the service. We came in for lunch on a Tuesday so it wasn't busy at all. The server was very helpful and attentive. Love Garcias one of the best Mexican food places for Fajitas, hands down!"}
{"text":"Despite iffy reviews, we stopped for dinner because I had a Living Social deal to redeem.  This location does not deserve the bad rap it has gotten.  The food was good, the wait was nonexistent and our server, Larina, was a delight!  The restaurant is clean, we'll decorated and very conveniently located.  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"First time we tried Garcia's Mexican Restaurant, chips were good, service was great!  All the young ladies were very friendly.  We were greeted immediately by our server and she kept our drinks full, food was brought out within reasonable time and was very good!  The restaurant stays very busy, we were satisfied with service.  This is more of a chain restaurant, but quite tasty and prices reasonable. We'll return!"}
{"text":"Not sure if we came on a bad day or what, but there was nothing good about this dining experience at all. Atmosphere was blah, service was sub par, the food was horrible, the beer was flat and when we spoke to the manager about our concerns his attitude was \"whatever, pay your bill and move on\". No need to go on about this place. I can say without reservation that I won't be back."}
{"text":"What a great experience for my family and I!   Not only was the food delicious but the service was fantastic! Caitlynn made sure that our drinks were always topped off and we were never in need of anything.   I could have probably hung around all day chowing down on the light and warm tortilla chips, homemade bean dip, and fresh salsa. The guacomole was not overly seasoned and made to order. The chunks of avocado made for a healthy and yummy dish - and at $3.99, it's a steal!  White the shrimp fajitas were tasty, I would suggest giving the fajitas a healthy overhaul. A little too much oil and harshly chopped veggies don't do much for the presentation.   Kids meals were a great serving size, coloring contest kept them entertained, and they didn't even bat an eye when I wheeled in my large stroller with a sleeping toddler. The game was playing at the bar and the bartender made sure to give us a nice, friendly greeting as soon as we came in the door.   Will definitely be visiting Garcia's again!"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes and watched while they sat everyone after us almost right away. Very disorganized and clueless staff. Will never go here again for such basic Mexican food."}
{"text":"An overall lackluster experience. The chips, salsa and beans were good - however there were three of us studly men there for lunch and the chips didn't last long. The empty basket remained for a while, but eventually was refilled.   I went with the spinach enchilada lunch special with rice & beans. It was average. The waitress was cute and that was a plus, but she was also slow. It took a little long to get the food, too long to refill the chips and too long for the check.   I would definitely avoid a special trip to come here, but if I were at the Arizona Mills and wanted to eat somewhere that wasn't the food court and not the Rainforest Cafe, I guess it would be this place..."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Stood at the hostess area for at least 5 minutes before we were greeted.  Once we were seated, our waitress was MIA for the most part except to take our order and bring our food.  We had to ask our server for Chips and salsa, which are usually the first thing to hit the table.  And that didn't come for another 5-10 minutes.    The food is your standard Mexican restaurant fare - nothing to write home about though.    While we were waiting for our server to come by so we could get to-go boxes and the check, Baby C started fussy.  So instead of being \"those parents\", I took him outside and got him car ready.  I do all this thinking that his dad would be heading out in a few minutes.      After 10 minutes pass, Im starting to wonder WTH was going on...so I grab the baby and head back inside.  J is still sitting there at the table waiting for our server.  He gets up and asks someone to go get her.  A few minutes later, she comes by....she was apparently tending to silverware.  Yeah, lets forget that you have customers at a table lady.    We probably wont be back, which is a shame since this is right around the corner from the house."}
{"text":"Service was alright - food was pretty good.  Nothing terrible, but nothing amazing. I do wish this place had been there when we lived around the corner from here."}
{"text":"The Garcia's on Thomas Rd. is 10x better than this location.  This location has much higher traffic than any other Garcia's we've been to.  We had a 45 minute wait on a Saturday.    The table was dirty when we were seated (food from previous patrons; appetizer plate wasn't cleaned well in dishwasher). The waitress remedied the situation quickly.    FOOD:  I had a skinny margarita that was pretty bad.  Made from a way-too-sugary mix.    We got the nachos for an appetizer and split the spinach enchiladas for our entree. Sizable portions for both. I only took one bite of the entree we split since the nachos were enough for a meal, even when splitting.   The flavors left much to be desired. Nachos can only be so bad, but it's clearly pre-made guacamole and generic pre-grated cheese. I didn't taste the beans and rice that came with the enchilada, but my boyfriend said they tasted like standard chain restaurant beans and rice. The enchilada had minimal flavor.   This Garcia's didn't live up to our previous experiences.  I know, I know, it's a chain, but I've had some good food previously! My suggestion: do a little Yelping and find an authentic Mexican restaurant nearby."}
{"text":"Went in on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't crowded. The waitress was friendly and quickly brought us our drinks. They give you bean dip (refried beans w/japs in it?) and salsa. The bean dip is something I've never seen given at Mexican restaurants, so it was a nice touch.   I got the fajita salad; it was fine.  My boyfriend got the pollos funditos, which he also thought was fine. Nothing was spectacular, but it wasn't bad.  I'd go back. It's your typical Mexican restaurants. The place was clean and the waitstaff was friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for my BF's birthday. Margaritas were great (he had the House Margarita and I had a mango Margarita). We had mini chimichangas as an appetizer and they were excellent. I had Chile Colorado (red chile beef) which was awesomely tender. The BF had a 3-enchilada special and I'm guessing he liked it because he sure chowed down - LOL!!! Wait staff was attentive - chips and salsa plentiful. The only thing marring a great evening was the obnoxious, loud, no-filter women (3 of them) who got seated next to us with their 3 children. The children were vying for attention, so the a$$hat women just talked over them. Loudly. So loud that my BF and I couldn't hear each other speak and had to shout to each other to be heard. Would you like to know about the epidural one of them had??? Yep, didn't think so - me neither. Blessings to the wait staff who were very quick to bring our check and \"to-go\" boxes so that we could leave and enjoy the rest of our meal away from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Garcia's is alright. Nothing special, just kind of blah food. Not bad though if you are happen to be close by. This would not be on the top of my recommendation list."}
{"text":"Yum.  I will say, there are \"better\" places to go for Mexican food, but nothing beats the easy and fast aspect like Garcias. this time I tried the happy hour sampler platter and it was SO MUCH food and for only like $6 dollars- deal of the day.   I will definitely be coming back and enjoying my meal again soon!"}
{"text":"So we came to this restaurant about 4 years ago and it was good. We came back here tonight 11/12/2014. Wow I can't figure out what was so special about this place. We get seated in a both, so that was nice with the baby. Then that was it no water on the table to drink, while waiting for the waiter. Then after about 10 minutes a waiter shows up we order our drinks and food and a hour later the waiter tells us, sorry for the wait, their are only 2 cooks. We finally got our food a hour and a half later after ordering. Well I'll never come back here again. I wonder if they will wait a hour and half after we leave for their money. Wow and this dinner was lousy worst so called Mexican food ever. The check for the 3 of us was $40. That's crazy."}
{"text":"We like Garcia's.  We have eaten at several of them so are pretty familar with the menu.  This time we took friends to enjoy the food with us.  First thing we are served is the chips.  Along with those chips come the normal dipping sauce the bean dip.  Normally we love the bean dip.  At Garcia's you don't have to order it extra and it's free. I did say \"normally\" we love it.  However, not so at this Garcia's.  It has a kick to it so unlike the other Garcia restaurants.  We didn't care for it at all.  The special of the day was a two taco plate for $6.99.  What a deal and yummy too.  Other orders at our table were for the enchilada platter.  This was another tasty dish.  The food was good and so was the service.  Prices at Garcia's are also very reasonable.  The only thing we did not like is the bean dip.  It was just too spicy and since that's one of the things I like most, we probably won't stop at this one again but will visit others and hope they haven't changed too."}
{"text":"We love Garcia's and our dinner at this location was just as good as we've experienced in the past.  We especially love being served the bean dip along with the chips when we sit down.  Other restaurants serve those only when ordered off the menu.    The food is always fresh, fast and delicious.  At our table we had the cheese enchiladas, charro beans and the fajitas.  Delicious.  Our server was excellent.  Our water glasses were refreshed often and he checked back on us to be sure we were happy with our meals.  Great place !"}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp tacos... not only were there not enough shrimp in the tacos, they were awful. Tasted like frozen boiled shrimp. Margaritas were good if the waiter remembered to bring them."}
{"text":"One word describes this place and that word is \"disappointing\". From the service to the food \"disappointing\". I love the original location on 35th Ave but this one doesn't even come close. Bland refried beans, fake enchilada sauce and weak salsa. Definitely a one and done for me."}
{"text":"Really disappointed order a shredded beef burrito dinner and they brought me a ground beef burrito and honestly the taste was nothing to write home about if I would of know could of gone to Taco Bell less expensive and better tasting will never go back"}
{"text":"First off, if you have room after your meal, try the chocolate chimis. They are SO good.  I've been coming here for lunch with work friends for a couple years now. The service was iffy sometimes...but it ia getting better. I went the other day for lunch and the service was up to par with other restaurants."}
{"text":"My friend thought he was bringing us to Macayo's, but it turned out to be Garcia's but we were just in the mood for Mexican food so we stayed. Our server was a little rough around the edges, but she got the job done so I can't really complain. I can't remember if it was HH, but I got a regular margarita which was very good. To eat, I believe I had a combination with a beef taco and a chicken enchilada, which was good. The queso and salsa that they brought out was good, but not mind blowing. Would I come back? Eh, not sure."}
{"text":"Food was average at best. Drinks were good and service was acceptable. The price was the big killer for me. The cost for a taco salad, fish tacos and two drinks was $41.00. There is no way this place was worth that much money."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad at all! The service is a bit spotty, sometimes they're great other times we've been forgotten about. The food is pretty decent. It's not the best but certainly not the worst either. Whenever we want a quick, close by mexican fix this is where we come. We usually get fajitas but we've also tried the tacos, chimichanga, the cheese crisp and burritos. I'm sure we'll keep coming here over and over. Don't have huge expectations for this long running, mexican chain restaurant and you'll enjoy it!"}
{"text":"It's hard to talk me into eating at Garcia's since they are like the Chili's of \"Mexican\" food. But, there aren't many options left at AZ Mills so it was what we decided to have for lunch. Somehow I could have eaten the chips and spicy bean dip and been happy with that. But I ordered the most American-Mexican dish you can order, Pollo Fundido. I wasn't in the mood to think or look through the menu and knew the cooks are probably used to making it for everyone so it would be a safe choice. It was, and the rice and beans on the side were better than average. The only thing I forgot was to say no slice of melted orange American cheese, yuck. But it was easy to push off, and the shredded chicken inside was hot and fresh so I couldn't complain.   I really didn't like how small their plastic cups were, our waitress was slow and my iced tea was empty a few times. Also I asked her for more of that spicy bean dip and she never brought any even though she said she would. I saw several other waiters bringing out refills of it to other tables and I thought they might be coming to ours at one point but no. Could I have asked again? Yes. Did I care enough to? No.   Was I full and ready to walk off my meal in the mall? Yeah, so I guess it wasn't that bad of a lunch."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the service was even better. Our server, Maria, was fabulous. She even went so far as to tell us what was on top of every entree in case there was something we didn't want. This was great because I am not a fan of olives and didn't think they may be on my flautas so they just left them off for me. My flautas were wonderful. Other people in my group liked their taco salad and the El Magnifico sampler, the beef chimichanga was the biggest hit."}
{"text":"We told the manager what happen last night and what's funny is we said we were never comin there again but I guess he didn't wanna lose any customers so he offerd to take care of everything to night so we came back there the food was great and the service was great and the manager was nice he took car of everything I guess if your in for some good Mexican food I'd come and eat hear everything was great"}
{"text":"I love the bean dip they give you with chips. Im critical on the salsa, being from New Mexico, :) I always get the enchilada plate when I eat here and its pretty good Not the best but not bad enough to say anything mean about it They have $3 margs during happy hour and the bartenders are usually very cool and cater to your every drinking need"}
{"text":"We stopped going to Garcia's for a long time after a few bad experiences. We had raw chicken once, wrong orders once, etc. So after close to a year, my daughter talked me into giving them a try again since they were once a favorite. Well....They are BACK! It was really good again. I love that they bring out bean dip and salsa. I don't like beans but it is a nice touch. The pollo fundido was amazing like it used to be. Great rice, great salsa, great service. They have coupons regularly in the paper as well. The manager was going around asking everyone how their service and food was which I always appreciate. We will be back and soon! Glad they have hopefully fixed the problems they were having!"}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting AZ & this Mexican restaurant hit the spot! The nachos were to die for & I couldn't even eat my entree because I was too full!"}
{"text":"We had a little party the other night on the patio -we had the most amazing waitress named DESI...her mama was the bartender...great drinks food and service.....loved it~"}
{"text":"Took my peanut here for lunch after a visit to the aquarium.  The Raspberry Jalapeno Margarita was very tasty.  I enjoy the sweet with a hint of spice for my margaritas.  The bartender was even nice enough to alter a traditional margarita with some jalapenos as well so that was a great touch of customer service.   Our server was prompt and friendly.  She was patient with the peanut so that's always a plus.  The fresh salsa was very good and the chips hot.  We only stopped in for an app and some ice cream for the kiddo.  We didn't get a chance to really try something that they are known for.  I got mini enchiladas that were good but not knock-your-socks-off or anything.  I enjoy a habanero sauce with my Mexican food and was bummed to see that they didn't offer any kind of spicy sauce (other than salsa - relax).  Bottom line - I'd definitely go again (I will even recommend it to anyone in the Chandler Mall area) but won't go out of my way to get there."}
{"text":"Went to Garcia's for the first time last night, it is a great place to eat. We all couldn't eat everything on out plates, so we have left overs for today. There chips (made there) at great!!! Bean dips is so good, that you can't stop eating them, and then your food arrived and was to stuffed to eat it all. The waitress, Maria hooked us up with more chips and bean dip to come home with, at no extra cost. She was a great server!!!  Food is awesome! great atmosphere! Will go back again!!!"}
{"text":"We came for mediocre Mexican food and it was fine. My mini chinos were oddly cold but whatever. I am so disappointed by the service. My server was terrified of the manager. That is unacceptable and tells me this place is run badly. I explained to my server that I have had bariatric surgery. What that means to the lay person is that 85% of my stomach was removed aka I can't eat more than the equivalent of 1/2 of cup of food at a time. So like I do everywhere I go I requested to order off the kids menu. Nobody has ever taken issue with it. The guy was terrified and said he'd been yelled at for this. Not wanting anyone to be yelled at I asked to speak to his manager so that I could explain. It's not about the money it's about the fact that I can't consume the food so why do I need to buy that much of it?! So he says yes I'll put it in as kids meal. Okay, fine. Well it arrives and is a huge platter and missing my side of beans which is what I really wanted anyway. I had my one mini chimi and one mini taco. There remained 8 left. Which is why I didn't want an adult sized meal. Total waste. No other restaurant has had an issue with me ordering from the kids menu. So the bill comes and sure enough it was not the kids meal it was the full platter I was charged for. Nobody ever came to explain that it could not be done for me. So I again asked to speak with a manager. I was told the manager left. I highly doubt this is true. The server ended up comping my meal and I think it was because he was terrified to ring up the kids meal. That you run such a negative work environment tells me that I don't ever need to come back. You owe your employees better than that's. There are so many valley Mexican restaurants that will let me order how I need to order that I won't ever need to come back here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good.  We've been to this one and the one inside Arizona Mills.  All servers are nice and very friendly.  Prices, quantity, quality and flavor is on point.  If there was anything negative I could say, it would be that the chips aren't freshly fried and the bean dip they give with the salsa is gross...seriously...it's a weird concoction in my opinion.  We did, at another time just ordered all desserts and they were ALL so very good."}
{"text":"I ordered the flautas, comes with rice and beans and a quesadilla for my son. Food was bland, and my flautas were overly done. Will NOT be returning, simply not good."}
{"text":"Mexican food. Let me say one more time Mexican food. Rice beans and tortillas. It's pretty simple 99% of the time everything is good. I thought the food at this restaurant was a little bland. Maybe it was just my luck of the day. But I'll be back and give another try. The price is right"}
{"text":"I don't understand why more people aren't flocking to this place.....it is AWESOME!   The food is great, the service is fantastic, but the drinks are the BOMB!  Get the Coco motion or the Red Apple Sangria and taste little bit of paradise.  The salsa and bean dip they serve with chips is delicious.   I've tried several items on the menu now and have not been disappointed yet.  If you like Mexican food and margaritas and mixed drinks this is a great place to go.  Reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Our server knew his atmosphere - witty, quick to refill water, gave us extra salsa for our rice without us asking, brought out spicy salsa, and made a lot of observations.  My family and I got seated right away.  The margaritas are amazing - about as good as my mom's.  The salsa and free bean dip are mild, but you can request spicier salsa.  Their green salsa, however, is like watery onions - I overheard it tasting like Chinese soup; no noticeable tomatoes or tomatillos.  I ordered the seafood (lobster tasting fish and shrimp) fundido which is basically a fatty chimichanga with jalapeno cream cheese and queso.  The queso is just cheese, not queso dip.  The rice and beans are average.  My dad ordered tamales (a no-meat option was good) and they were larger than expected.  These tamales were not normal miniature-sized.  My mom had tacos separated from rice with corn husks so that the tacos would not get soggy.  Our total order was around $60, so it was not inxpensive.  I would say that the $6 margaritas and chips and salsa would be worth it just to come here.  The salsa reminds me of Macayo's actually.  None of this canned salsa taste but also none of this authentic watery salsa taste - just Americanized Mexican taste for the food which I love."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican chain in town.  Food is plain and low quality.  Service is delayed.  The steak quesadilla is good with cream cheese but I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service couldn't ask for a better meal and service!! Manager stopped us on ur way out to make sure we had a good meal and service. Already planning a return trip this weekend!!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!!!!  I love this place, the food is awesome (especially at happy hour) the service is friendly and inviting and the atmosphere in the bar is excellent.  Just for the record I always went on happy hour, a few beers washing down the free tortilla chips and dips followed by one of their delicious appitizers.  I WILL BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"Overall the experience was a bust. When we first moved to AZ 30 years ago Garcia's was all the rage. Moving back here recently, I decided to take my family there. Starting off, service was slow, but hey it was 7pm on a Friday.   The staff was pleasant, the cheese crisp was excellent...it better be ;p. After that it went down hill. The food was unseasoned...just bland. The Grande Burro I had was half tortilla...just a mouthful of dough. Half way through I found a big, nasty strand of chicken skin and fat.   I informed the waitress and she said she would inform the chef and left the check behind. No offer to send over the manager or deduct it from the bill. She ended up brining a new one to go. The new burro came so quickly it's completely obvious it was pre-made and chucked in the microwave. I brought it home but I'm scared to touch it.   I won't be bringing anyone back. Sorry Garcia's.....adios amigo."}
{"text":"Always had a great time here. Service is the best and always with a smile. Great margaritas and the best seafood enchiladas. Love the outdoor seating and fireplace."}
{"text":"This place is no where near Mexican food. To expensive for whatever I was eating. Is not authentic and was not good. I went because I was highly recommend it but really regret it."}
{"text":"My favorite Garcia's used to be the one on 35th Ave and Peoria I believe on the West side but we recently moved to East mesa and found that there was one just about a mile from us on the corner of University and Gilbert Rd. We have eaten there on at least six occasions and have found it to be very reasonably priced and really pretty decent Mexican food. The service is quick, the food is good, and the atmosphere is inviting...and I love that they serve bean dip with the chips as well as the salsa. I will visit this restaurant many times! The chimichangas are awesome! I see some of the reviews are not as good as I think they should be. I say this because I have been there many times and have not had a bad meal yet...this restaurant is very consistent and good Mexican food in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to eat here its always good. Good service good food. I love mexican restaurants that give you chips and dip right when your seated so thats another good thing about this place. And I always order a cheese crisp which is always delicious."}
{"text":"My spouse and I recently hit Garcia's about 5pm for happy hour. The food and drink here are very, very Americanized so diners looking for a more creative or authentic Mexican food experience will definitely want to go elsewhere. Having said that, I thought both of our meals were decent enough for the price.  I had the grilled chicken burrito and my spouse had a three-item platter with chili relleno, sour cream enchilada, and tamale. His combo plate was definitely better than my burrito, which was a bit dry and underfilled with chicken.  Still, compared to other Mexicanized restaurants out there, this place seems pretty good.  The service was as efficient and attentive as can be expected, and the both dining room and bathroom were clean.  The bean dip along with the chips and salsa is a nice touch at this place, too."}
{"text":"Another bad experience at this Garcia's! As much as I enjoy their happy hour prices the service is always horrible. Anytime I needed our server she was MIA and when I did see her she was rushing past our table to help someone else....it was ridiculous! This is the third time I've been to this Garcia's and had a bad server... Its obvious management is not managing and good service is not a priority....one more thing the bus boy was eating while he was working, I thought that was weird. Don't go to GARCIA'S in Az Mills, you will regret it."}
{"text":"Food is average. Nothing to brag about. The supreme fajita was very good but the onions and peppers were burnt. I had the beef fajita was so chewy and rubbery I sent it back and didn't eat(I've only done that one other time in my life). My wife ordered the  Margarita and was told it was only 1/2 price  in the bar ( witch was on the other side of the wall)and tasted like it sat in a frozen machine all day. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Was weary of trying this location due to not so great experiences with other locations, food wise but it wasn't bad. I ordered the Pollo fundido which was really great. The guacamole and salsa for an appetizer was huge for 2 people and the staff was very mindful of outlet table.. over a decent experience.. not the authentic Mexican that I was looking for but none the less good for the style it represented"}
{"text":"I thought long and hard about this review and here is the bottom line. This is just pitiful. Apparently, no one connected with this place cares...; they are just going through the motions. The place looks and feels blah. The food is uninspired - dull, cold, boring. This may have been the most depressing meal I have had in a while. And I have been eating at Garcia's going back to the mid 80s. Its time for management to re-commit or just retire.  Anyone thinking this is ok isn't being honest with themselves. Apathy can no longer be accepted. I work too hard for my money and I am sure you do too. This review makes me sad, and I am sorry to be so blunt."}
{"text":"I had some friends here visiting Saturday and BRAGGED about this place. I was very disappointed. The waitress greeted us almost immediately and yet it took 20 minutes to get a glass of water, followed by cold bean dip. An hour before our drinks finally came. When the food finally came out EVERYTHING was cold, all 4 of our platters. None of ate we all asked for boxes and then gave our boxed food to a peddling Bum outside the front door asking for money.  I doubt I will ever go back again, what a shame... I was a waitress once, I would have asked if something was wrong if I had a 4 top and nobody touched it !!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to local Mexican joint, close to the house and kids eat free on Sundays."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love Garcia's, so it unfortunate I feel I need to write about an awful experience we had. We went to the Gilbert/university location in the evening of 12/2/15. It was busy, but not to the point of every table being full. When walked in we were told a 5-10 minute wait. We were eventually seated by the hostess who told us our waiter would be with us. We sat patiently and after about 5 minutes he came for our drink order asked if we wanted chips, which I found odd because our previous trips they automatically bring chips. We didn't see him again until 10 mins later when he was getting a larger table that was seated after us drinks and chips. I them asked him why we have received chips and just barely received water, he proceeded to say it was on another guy to get chips. At this point we were sitting 15 minutes and to be served, meanwhile the larger group that walked in the door after us received not only chips but drinks as well from the same waiter who was supposed to be our waiter. After 20 minutes and I know for sure it was 20 I told my fiancé we needed to leave, our money shouldn't be spent on poor service. As we were leaving we were approached by a young lady who asked if we were ok, I told her no and explained the situation. She offered to reseat us and get the order straight in. I declined because the service should have been that from the beginning or at least wait to seat us when a waiter wasn't so busy. If this is the type of service the restaurant is going to have I don't want to return, 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to stop by Garcia's last night after a Birthday party because the restaurant (Ranch House Grille) down the street was closed for the evening. I had also never tried fried ice cream before so we decided to make it happen. We were seated quickly, a server immediately brought out chips, salsa, and refried beans for us to munch on while we looked at the menu. We split a steak and shrimp meal and ordered the strawberry fried ice cream after.  The steak and shrimp meal also came with some grilled peppers and onions and some buttered fried potatoes. I really enjoyed  the shrimp and the steak was nothing fancy. The strawberry fried ice cream was YUM. I imagined it being warm because of it being deep fried but it wasn't warm. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.    Our server seemed bored but was very quick at taking our order and refiling our drinks. I appreciated that she didn't hover or approach our table every few seconds making it uncomfortable to eat like I have experienced at other restaurants. I also liked that the restaurant had somewhat dim lighting, which creates a very relaxing environment in my opinion. I plan on going back when I have a craving for fried ice cream. However, next time I want to try either the chocolate or caramel syrup, rather than just the strawberry."}
{"text":"Not a bad Mexican food chain restaurant. Servers are attentive.   But there's a much better and cheaper option down the street from this joint."}
{"text":"For 35.00 here is what you get.  1 unspiced el pollo fundido.  The jalapino sourcream was lacking any jalapino, and the trademark stuffed burrito was seriously lacking the chicken, it was mainly wrapper and burnt cheese.  the classic bean dip was missing any flavor at all, tasted like what i can pull from a can at home.  the salsa was the highlight of our meal and that comes free.  but the chips we had to eat it with were stale.  which i don't understand since they are supposed to be made fresh daily.  finally the rice, it was cooked twice and then microwaved and was still only luke warm when i got it after waiting for 15 minutes to be greeted at the door."}
{"text":"Okay, so at one point in time I would have been happy to say Garcia's was a good place to eat. Not anymore. It is probably the worst place, ever. Let me tell you of my experience and their horrible service at this place...  We were at Arizona Mills and were starving.  We passed up Rainforest Café as the wait was long and Garcia's was no waiting.  Now I know why..  We were seated almost immediately. Now keep in mind I have eaten at Garcia's in the past (years ago) and was pleased.  The first thing I notice is our waiter looks like a McDonalds reject- his grammar is horrid and he mumbles almost constantly.  There is nothing pleasant about this guy. I order a beer and fish tacos.    After over 20 minutes, my beer shows up, and is sloshed all over the table.  Okay- no big deal. I wait, and wait, and wait... Finally, my fish tacos show up- or, wait- what is this? He gives me the plate of food and leaves.  I sit, staring in amazement wondering why my fish tacos look so funny. I look at my plate, wave to get his attention and when he finally has time for me he comes over.  I tell him \"Hey, I don't know what this is, but I ordered fish tacos!\" His reply? Get ready- I've never, ever in my life heard this one. My waiter, the guy who is supposed to make my eating experience here WONDERFUL says \"The guy who got your tacos isn't complaining\", of course I chuckle thinking he is joking when indeed I realize he is NOT.  He points across the room to the guy who received my tacos and seemed to have no issue with it. I tell him I do not want the mess in front of me, but the fish tacos. I am surprised he didn't go get the half eaten ones from the other guy.  I get my fish tacos, they were disgusting. Poor quality, poor taste, poor everything.  I get the ticket, to see not only was I charged for the Steak and enchilada sauce (or whatever it was) but for the TWO plates of fish tacos! WOW! All I got from this restaurant, was a very bitter taste in my mouth!"}
{"text":"We have tried so many places for Mexican food and Garcia's is our \"go to\" place and we are never disappointed.  Serving sizes are big, service is excellent, food is always good.  A bit of a drive for us, but worth it."}
{"text":"Garcias reminds me of the late 80's/early 90's Chi-Chi's. Everything is either salt less &bland or overtly cheese covered. The chips and bean dip are decent but the kitchen staff are ridiculously lazy and can't even cut up the tortillas for the chips. Fried, Half tortillas as chips, when really it's like dipping with a tostada. Our server didn't listen to a single thing we said, just rushed us thru the ordering process and then took 30 minutes for our food to come out. Half of our order was wrong when it did come out and honestly it's not real authentic Mexican food. It's what white, mild middle aged Americans want to think Mexican food is like. We asked for no salt margs, both came out loaded with salt and overly boozy. The chimichanga appetizer comes out with a giant glob of sour cream with pickled jalapeños in it, which was utterly disgusting. My boyfriend ordered the red burro, and it literally was 6 pieces of meat and then a bunch of sauce wrapped up in a burrito. My enchiladas were ok, but were plastered in a 1/4 inch of melted cheese. I love cheese, but this is just overkill for compensate for the lack of actual flavor. The rice was flavorless, and our beans were barely warmed after being dumped out from a can. Did I mention our service was dismal? My boyfriend didn't even finish his food (which never happens, he eats everything in sight), and I took mine home in a box (of which I never ate and it ended up in the trash). I totally feel like we could have gotten better Mexican food from a taco truck! Nevermind our $50 bill, the food itself reminds me of what a high school or hospital cafeteria would crank out as \"Mexican food\". Even the fried ice cream isn't even fried!! It's just a ball of low quality ice cream that's been rolled in stale corn flakes. What a shame, especially in a border state!!! Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Hmmm... I'm conflicted and a bit perplexed by this one.    First, let me admit that I bought a LivingSocial deal to this place and accidentally let it expire on Sept 3rd.  Knowing this, I called the restaurant and spoke with Jerry the manager.  After I told him the deal expired, he told me, \"Don't worry about it, we will still take it.\" He was extremely pleasant on the phone and I presumed that he meant that the full deal would still be honored.   On the same day that I called and spoke with Jerry the manager, I went over to Garcia's.  After sitting down at my table, the server told me that she can only accept the \"paid value\" for the deal (which is the amount that I already paid) and that it will be deducted from my bill.  I explained that this was not my understanding after talking to Jerry the manager, but she said that she, \"just talked to Jerry about it.\"    While I did not ask for Jerry (because sometimes I just don't feel like fighting), I am very displeased at the miscommunication that took place here.  I am deducting four stars for this whole debacle.    With all of that said, the pollo fundido was very good (even though my spellcheck keeps changing it to \"pool funded\")... and the house margarita helped to turn my frown upside down... but the crowning moment of this visit was the fried ice cream.  Took me back to my childhood and all was good again.  For Garcia's Mexican Restaurant, this means I added a star back.  I'd go back because of the food and fried ice cream, but not the service."}
{"text":"I visited with my husband and son. We all really liked the bean dip and the chips were good too. My son loved the fajitas. My chile Rellano was ok. Not the best one I have had in town but it was acceptable especially since the margaritas were only $3.99 for happy hour. Overall everything was pretty good. I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Brought a large group of 23 to this restaurant and had excellent service great margaritas and wonderful food.   It's located in the mills mall but is well worth going there.    I have the stuffed chicken with jalapeño and cream cheese. It was wonderful."}
{"text":"I admit, I tend to be a tough critic...hard to please. But I must say I am extremely impressed with Garcia's. Excellent, friendly service. Tasty food and comfortable atmosphere.  I plan on being a regular customer."}
{"text":"Darcy is great another manager too I forgot his name but he knows mine lol I have been ordering catering since 2012 and dining in for ever lol"}
{"text":"Why did I come here? Oh ya, a 5$ coupon in the mail. This place is not awesome. The food is all flavorless... so bland and so salty. It was nice that they give you bean dip, but the bean dip was also bland and nothing exciting. I just had a cheese crisp...pretty safe... but it had absolutely no flavor. It's like they just open cans and serve. Although this was marginally better than Manuel's, it still isn't a place I will come to again."}
{"text":"I read through the reviews before coming in here, and I considered not coming in.  I don't know why it has such horrible reviews.   First off the place is super clean, the decoration are very nice and the staff is very attentive, Israel our waiter was freaking awesome and on top of things.  The bean dip they bring to your table was fantastic. The food wasn't authentic but is was very good and hot!!!   This was our first time here and we have a four year old and turns out Sundays kids eat for $99¢.  Awesome."}
{"text":"Well first off this happened a few months ago. I decided to get some mexican for lunch and Garcia's was in the mall where I work. We placed our order and the food came out a little late. So we asked to get it to go, the waiter literally said \"are you f**king kidding me?\" I was very surprised and told him \"yes I'm f**cking serious\". How are you going to use that language towards a customer. I was late getting back to work because they took their sweet time packing it up. It wasn't just the one server, the entire staff are a bunch of dicks. I'm never going there again."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible, horrible. Worst food and drink i have purchased anywhere in a long time. No flavor in the food. When we found the salsas to be bland we asked them to spice up our entree when we ordered. We should have left since the drink was weak too.   They grilled up a jalapeño and had tossed it on the food. Bland like chalk it was. When the bill came we found it cost us 99 cents. Told our waitress other than the service everything was poor. She apologized but of course it wasn't her fault. Paid our bill and on the way out spoke to Derek the manager. He said he didn't set the prices and shrugged off that the food had no flavor or spice.   Stay. Away. Wish I had read the reviews before I went. Too many places nearby to patronize."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here on a Friday evening. It was packed with a 25 minute wait. I saw several empty tables and booths. After 20 minutes we were seated and a big bowl of chips was dropped off at our table with 3 small containers of various salsa. After reviewing the menu, we decided to split a combo. My half was the burrito with ground beef. This came with black beans, and rice on a bed of lettuce. The burrito was made from an 8 inch flour tortilla filled with refried beans, ground beef, and cheese, covered in white sauce. The burrito was good, but not great. The sauce made it a little more special than Taco Bell, but other than that it tasted similar. I my return again, but not on a Friday night. I do want to try other items like the fajita or enchilada."}
{"text":"Happy time at Garcia's. All you can eat enchilladas for $9.99. Reviewed the other options on the menu and it was a no brainer.  Chips were fresh, the salsa and beans were ok , but the enchilladas were very good. Your order comes with rice and beans. Had the black beans and rice.  You have a choice of mix or match enchilladas. Had the shredded chicken, spinich and cheese, and sour cream and chicken  enchilladas. Hands down, the chicken and sour cream were the favorites. Great ambience and service. Nice place to spend a leisurely weekend lunch."}
{"text":"The food was not very good. I ordered steak and shrimp, and the shrimp had no color and the steak was under seasoned. I also ordered a margarita and it was so sweet! Overall, the place is not worth the money. Recommend Gecko Grill- which is not far from this establishment."}
{"text":"The food is different than before. I think the par cooking is the issue. The plate is very hot the food on it is not and it is not as tasty as I remember it being kinda makes me sad I loved the Tampico stuffed chicken before and now not so much.."}
{"text":"I never say things like this but this manager needs to be fired immediately! She was so rude to my mother it's incomprehensible that she is employed at all! A long black hair was mixed in with the salsa that was sat down at the table. When my mother who is a blonde by the way said something to the manager she responded with so much attitude, told her no one there has black hair and it must have come from us!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fantastic patio, great staff and on the occasion that the kitchen is a little backed up and taking a little longer the manager is there to make it right! I often come here with my family on a Sunday night and I would recommend it to anyone! The fajitas are to die for and I definitely recommend the coconut margarita! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Nothing more disappointing than waiting over and hour for your food delivery and they didn't give me the dressing for the salad or the extra side of salsa I asked for. And to top it off my salad has all of the wrong toppings than what was described, covered in fruit and missing the tortilla strips and guacamole. Also my finances salad has beef when it said it came with chicken. Pretty disappointing New Year's Eve dinner. Won't ever order again"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch yesterday (on Cinco De Mayo), and we were surprisingly seated right away. The restaurant was very clean, as was the table we were seated at. Our chips, salsa, and bean dip was delivered to our table as soon as we sat down as well.   Our server was less than friendly, and he didn't even introduce himself... He seemed more concerned with being efficient than being polite. Don't get me wrong, efficiency is a great trait, but some resemblance of people skills would have been nice too. Throughout our meal, he checked on us maybe once, and that was because my friend and I were both out of drinks (and had been for a while). I got the 2 option lunch plate with a chicken enchilada and a shredded beef taco, and an iced tea. The enchilada was really good and so was the taco, but because of the service, the experience was just mediocre.    We waited for ages for our check to come, and even then our server didn't ask if we wanted dessert (which my friend did) or how we wanted our check (separately). So, we ended up having to wait for her dessert to be made and then wait again for our correct check.   I don't think I will be returning in the near future... At least not to this location."}
{"text":"Went in because we had some time to kill - happy hour service in the bar was pretty slow - also ordered the \"queso\" which was basically melted cheese with spinach in it - absolutely terrible - there were only 2 of us and we each took one small bite. The waitress never asked if we liked it or why we didn't touch it ... Pretty poor service to not even acknowledge that. Probably won't return. Salsa was decent."}
{"text":"Free cheese crisp for checking in :) We were a party of 12. Table was ready when we got here. Food amazing as always! I visit anytime I'm in AZ. Reasonably priced. Large parties are usually a pain but service was awesome."}
{"text":"This place has excellent deals and great food!  I love the bean dip and the salsa they give you complimentary!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times before was one of my favorite but I will say today the people working aren't very friendly."}
{"text":"Great portions and reasonable prices. Drinks are strong which is a plus and atmosphere is a nice break from the mall. I always order the Olivia sampler because there's enough for for two people and it has the \"best\" items from the menu included. We come often :)"}
{"text":"My Parents and I go there often, and of course; the food is good, the drinks were good, and the chips with the different dips are bomb. The only thing that bothers me from time to time is the waiter. I can't recall his name but he makes our experience very uncomfortable. He gets snappy, talks over you, cuts you off mid-sentence when you're trying to ask a question. Because he does this every time we order, I'm unable to fully receive my food the way I want it. I'm not completely knowledgeable of what certain Mexican dishes are, what's in it, how it's cooked, what it comes with; so therefore I'm going to have questions. And he certainly isn't helpful. The dish I ordered was the spinach enchilada with rice and black beans. The spinach enchilada comes with green sauce which I didn't want. I was TRYING to ask the waiter not to add it or if he could, put it on the side. But instead he grunted with frustration, rolled his eyes trying to tell me it comes with it. Then I tried to ask him to just put it on the side. My Parents and I could feel the tension. I also tried telling him I wanted the re-fried beans, not black beans. When I received my order, I got black beans. My Parents insisted I tell him I wanted to change, but I felt like because of his attitude, he would make it out to be my fault. I didn't want to kill my appetite so I gave my black beans to My Dad and ate the bean dip as my side in place of the black beans. I don't know if our waiter felt the tension between us or what, but he started to be nice to us. I avoided talking to him and have rather enjoyed the gentleman whom was the host at the door. He was very nice, very patient, very helpful and just pleasant when he helped out with getting us refills, more chips and dip, taking plates out of way, ect. I give the host 5 stars all the way. The irritated waiter gets a thumbs down. But when it comes to this particular experience, 3 stars. I know we'll be returning to dine in again because My Parents enjoy their favorite Mexican dishes. I expect a better experience from the server IF we get him again. Otherwise, I will be asking for another waiter."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and a great margarita. First time here while visiting Az. We will be sure to come back again. Loved the bean dip they give you with your chips and salsa!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was very nice and very attentive and there was also a very nice woman who made sure we never ran out of chips, salsa, or bean dip. The food was good, not great but good. My husband had the El Magnifico Sampler, I had the Olivia's Sampler, and our son had the Mini Tacos and Chimis off the Kid's Menu. It was all good and we all had leftovers for the next two days. We also had a couple of margaritas which were very big and good as well. We did have water and luckily I asked for lemon in mine. My husband took one sip and said, \"Ugh that is Mesa tap water for sure.\" I really think they should invest in a water filtration system and their rating would go up by at least one star."}
{"text":"Sometimes you stumble on a place that's a winner.   We had a couple of hours to kill before our flight to Las Vegas, and found Garcia's.  We both had lunch specials... a taco plate and a taco salad.  Also ordered a side of guacamole. The chips, salsa and guacamole were quite tasty, and our main dishes  were good as well.  $22. with the tip and we were on the way to the airport."}
{"text":"Adequate food and ok place to go if you don't have time or desire to go to better places.  Big learning lesson was that the green chili tamale does not contain any meat.  That would have been an important data point to either convey in the menu or from the server."}
{"text":"Hungry and footsore near the end of a marathon shopping trip for the 13 year old, we decided to pause here for a bit of rest and refreshment, despite the low yelp ratings.  We had a decent experience here. Maybe they have made some improvements recently?  I really enjoyed the little bit of complimentary bean dip that I was able to snatch between the giant scoops that my oldest son kept shoveling into his mouth. The salsa had a tasty kick to it, and the chips were extra large, thin, and crispy.  The eldest ordered the poco chimis off of the appetizer menu. Much as he liked them, he was full with 2 chimis left. My husband (who received the leftovers) found the filling a bit dry, and the jalapeno cream cheese too bland to deserve the 'jalapeno' in its name.  My green corn tamales were a tad sweet for my taste, reminiscent of El Torito sweet corn cake. No problem though, since the youngest gobbled up half!   Ambiance was comfortable and service was polite and efficient. My only complaint is that they never refilled the chip bowl even though it ran empty before our orders came out.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"We called ahead for a reservation for 7 and when we arrived we were able to get seated right away which was great. The staff was friendly our only complaint would be that the food took FOREVER to come out so we went through a few bowls of chips while waiting."}
{"text":"Been eating at Garcias since the original opened and moved to 35th Ave South of Thomas Road.  This is one of the franchise restaurants and one of the larger restaurant.    We ordered the Open Face Cheese Quesidilla which was nice and crispy. I ordered one of their signature dishes the Pollo Fundido which are chicken chimichanga with sour cream and cheese which are always good. My daughter ordered the Fish Tacos which were cod in a soft tortilla and presented nicely. The last dish we had were the Pork Fajitas that came out nice and sizzling.  Always love the chips and salsa that they have and generally pretty good about replenishing."}
