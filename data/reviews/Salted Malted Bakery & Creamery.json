{"text":"Awesome place, with amazing food! The cookies are phenomenal and the employees are way friendly! And their prices are truly unbeatable! I will be taking my friends here, as well as visiting at every opportunity!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff is great, the quality of food is awesome. If your part of a 12 step program for fat kids like I am than avoid at all costs. Because after one visit, you will be hooked and probably burn your gym membership. Damn it just thinking about this place as I write this review now I have the uncontrollable craving for a cinnamon sugar donut sundae with praline ice cream and caramel. Craps, looks like I'm off the wagon again. I'll see the rest of my fellow fat kids there."}
{"text":"The mini doughnuts is the way to go! I ordered half a dozen for the kids and I and I probably should of ordered more because it was that delicious. I also ended up buying half a dozen of cookies since they had cookies I have never had before. I got the cookies n Cream, churro, Blue velvet, and the chipster. Of course I had to take a bite of it all just to see how they taste. The Churro was probably my favorite, it was moist and the taste was on point. I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"I went here with my family to check out this new ice cream place. The staff and owners were very friendly and courteous. The service was excellent and the treats were even better! We even got to sample the mini donuts. 

If you are a Dole Whip fan, or a Peet's coffee fan, this is the place on the northwest side of town to get it! Everything looked amazing and their prices are incredible! I am hoping they add some more sugar free treats to their menu in the future. We will definitely be back! We can't wait to try out breakfast when the full menu is ready in a few days. It's hard to find a good treat shop with genuinely friendly service. Try them out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Amazing baked goods and the have a Mango Dole Whip!! This is a Canadian bakery and they have poutine! A must try in the Northwest."}
{"text":"Friendly bakery with all my weekly sweet needs. Homemade goodies best in Aliante, chocolate chip bacon cookie! Yes Please."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is great, they even have Dole Whip.  My son had a cookie ice cream sandwich which was amazing.  They also serve Peets coffee. The staff is so friendly and helpful.  I love supporting small businesses. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a great find. I took my Canadian friends for lunch. WE had Poutine and grilled cheese sandwiches. THe poutine was wonderful. IT needed a little more gravy.The large was enough for three of us. THe grilled cheese was ok. WE had Dole Whip for dessert. It is hard to find in LV. THat alone was worth going for. Can't wait to go again. THe service was wonderful.  My only complaint is that it needs more sit space."}
{"text":"Love their baked goodies! Taste homemade and so yummy!

Ordered breakfast sandwich and a large poutine, delicious! Be prepared the poutine is a huge portion.

The owners are very hospitable and friendly! 

Glad they are close by"}
{"text":"Food and choices are great! Love the atmosphere and prices as well. A great combination of breakfast and dessert style Canadian cuisine."}
{"text":"OMG this place rocks! I used to wait in line at the Minnesota Fair to get mini-donuts like this! They are amazing. Try the Green Tea, you'll thank me later! Congrats and I'll be back many, many, more times!"}
{"text":"I just tried salted malted for the first time with my family....and what a wonderful experience. Not only they have delicious cookies, ice creams, Malts and shakes, donuts and sandwiches, the service is superb. It's not always you see owners of great business talk to customers with sincerity. I mean they are just genuinely good people. Salted Malted is all in one...awesome cookies and ice cream and very friendly priced. I live in Aliante and i will definitely do the drive for ice cream and get it here. People,  these are the kind of great business we need to support to better our community. It's not too cold anymore....get some salted malted ice cream!!!!!"}
{"text":"Mini donuts were awesome. Canadian and American breakfast sandwiches were also amazing. Great service, great prices, and very gracious owners! Would recommend and am planning on going at least twice a week!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best cookies I have ever had and I love the dole whip they have, I haven't seen it anywhere else. They are also really nice and it is a great place to go"}
{"text":"Salted Malted is the finest specialty cookie shop, bar none. Since one of the owners is from Canada there is a decidedly pervasive Canadian influence. Poutine - I had never even heard of it. Who could resist fries topped with cheese curds and gravy. Their offerings are: specialty ice cream sandwiches, sandwiches, ice cream, DOLE WHIP, mini donuts, cinnamon buns, breakfast and lunch sandwiches, fries, grilled cheese (if you desire with Canadian bacon)... the list keeps growing.

There are two ways to make Canadian bacon. The week plus method of brining is the choice of the Salted Malted. I have never tasted tenderer or more flavorful Canadian bacon in my life. Ir the highlight of my day when it starts with a Canadian Sunrise (Canadian bacon, egg, and cheese).

The most important element in any business is customer service. Salted Malted staff are friendly, courteous, personable, and professional. I am a regular and am good friends with the owners and staff. The food is excellent but it is the staff that brings me back. The list of regulars is long. They all come back to visit and eat. There are two Cordon Bleu graduates on staff.

Leonard is always adding new items to the menu. Salted Malted is always new, exciting, delicious, and fun. Come on in and talk with Leonard, Cait, Jill, Jezmin, and Jackie."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! You can watch them make your mini donuts right when you order them! They have a wide variety of Canadian foods and snacks to choose from and the staff are extremely friendly. I highly suggest going to this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and very friendly staff. The donuts are super good and go great with their icecream"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Super friendly and amazing staff and the cookies and ice cream are to die!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I really like to leave reviews with photos, but when I get food here. I want to gobble it all up right away!!

We went here because it's literally next store to us. We wanted something different for breakfast. Something not greasy, quick, fresh...something not McDonalds(blah!) my husband went without a heads up. And he ordered me the Canadian Sunrise. OMG! It's the best thing ever! I can't explain how delicious this sandwich is!

The biscuit, it's like homemade! It's not dry, it's not over cooked, it's perfect! Then the fried egg with the yoke, the Canadian bacon, the cheese melted all over it...excuse me while I wipe the drool off now. Totally had a Homer Simpson moment. I literally wanted another one within the same week. It reminded me of childhood, when dad would grill up breakfast while camping. Ahhh great job guys!

My husband got a grilled cheese with Canadian bacon and a side of fries. He enjoys it. I'm too busy making out with my food to notice how he is doing with his. I snag a couple French fries and they're great! They freshly made. No frozen stuff. 

I can't wait to go in and try other items on the menu. 

Great place to check out!!!"}
{"text":"What a great find. Our whole family enjoyed their delicious shakes. The Dole Whip Float is amazing! The staff made us feel at home. I'm excited to come back and try some of the hot food."}
{"text":"Believe it or not I'm not really into sweets. Growing up with family members struggling with diabetes helped me watch my sugar intake. However, this place changed all that! (I know it's bad) But I'm trying to limit my visits. LOL...

Where to begin...I don't know where to start because everything about this cute little bakery is sooooo freakin' GOOD! Let me start with their \"AMAZING\" staff and owners. They are all very helpful, patient, friendly and have Excellent customer service. 

As for their Sweets; Cookies, Malt shakes, Ice Cream and Ice Cream cake are all \"TO DIE FOR\", Delish and the sweetness is so subtle. Everything taste soooo Refreshing and Savory you'll always leave with a box of goodies or more than you had planned to buy. Surprisingly, I have a favorite flavor. Their \"Bubble Gum\" Ice Cream Cake!!! One of the most delicious things I've ever eaten..it is just superb and decadent! I haven't tried everything quite yet but I am looking forward to trying out their Poutine Fresh-cut fries topped with cheese curds and gravy coming this Thursday! Till then, stay tuned for more updates..."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Their food and desserts are great, the staff and owner are very friendly, and to top it off - they play great music! 

I really enjoy the breakfast sandwiches and they serve them all day. We always order the mini donuts, they are delish! The cookies are wonderful, especially the churro cookie. 

Don't miss out, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly employees. I tried several cookies and they were all delicious, but I have to say the little donuts were out of this world and I'm not even a donut person !"}
{"text":"Great service! Great selection of yummy cookies! Must try the fries with the homemade sauces they are amazing"}
{"text":"The place is smaller on the inside like a quaint mom & pops, hole in the wall dessert place. I don't like menus that are up so high that I have to read the whole thing and would have preferred some kind of paper form to take my time with. I knew they had cookies so I just went straight to that side and got a 6 pack. 2 cookies n cream, 2 peanut butter, the Chipster, and macadamia cookie to go. Cake pop and smores bar for inside with my daughter. All the cookies were just the right amount of sweet. Not crowded and very friendly staff. We would come back for sure to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Between the four of us, we ordered a cookie sundae, doughnut sundae, coffee, an order of doughnuts, and poutine fries. On top of all this being completely delicious, we were given a free sample of \"toastnuts\", which are doughnuts that have gotten toasty from sitting under the heat lamp for maybe 20 minutes.  That should give you an idea about how fresh everything is. Can't wait to come back and try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"So I found this little gem as I randomly was looking for a place to eat one night. Since I originally lived in Toronto, it hasn't been easy to find a place that actually sold REAL poutine with REAL cheese curds. I saw that this place had it. Of course, I couldn't resist. Got there 5 mins before they were closing so unfortunately I wasn't able to try it that evening. Met the owner and he was such a delight. He told me to come back the next day which of course I had to. Met his wife who's originally from Canada and she was just a beautiful, vibrate and sweet woman. We met, we talked, we laughed. Seriously felt like home away from home. Right there I knew that this place was the real deal. The decor was absolutely warm and inviting. Completely made me feel as if I was back in Toronto. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for delicious sweet treats or a craver of poutines. I am definitely going to be dropping by whenever I'm in town. Simply j'adore!"}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times and everything is always amazing. We've tried multiple types of cookies they have been great our favorite is the maple bacon. Tonight we tried the mini doughnuts they pack so much flavor. I will warn you the hardest part about coming here is deciding what to get."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Best hot fudge Sunday I've had in a long time. And smells what I would think the end of a rainbow would smell like."}
{"text":"Amazing treats!   Everything was very yummy.   My group got a malted shake, cookies, plain ice cream and cookie sandwiches.

EVERYTHING was absolutely DELICIOUS! 

So yum. I can't express more.

Super friendly staff, quick service even though they were really quite busy. 

They also had sandwiches, poutin, and fresh doughnuts 

--came back a second time and got a carrot cake cookie.  OH MY I am in love!   So so so SO good.   Definitely get one of those too"}
{"text":"Three words: Maple Bacon Cookie! OMG, that just changed my life, it was perfect. When I went I ordered several things including the key lime bar, nutella brownie, red velvet cookie, etc. and everything was delicious. I would avoid the churro cookie if you don't plan on eating it right away. It turns really soft and mushy and was not great to eat later. I also got four regular poutine for the family and I was surprised at how large they were. It was definitely a generous serving. Next time I'll probably get two larges and add bacon to it for about the same price. But Salted Malted Bakery is definitely a Mom and Pop shop I hope lasts."}
{"text":"Cute place with a few breakfast options, ice cream, and bakery selections. There is a Canadian theme with some menu items like poutine (fries, cheese curds, Canadian bacon, in bacon). Our food came out fresh made and tasted good. 4 stars for being a pleasant surprise. More menu options might help, but overall, good experience and we'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of everything sweet and if you need a sweet fix, this place should be at the top of your list!!! The cookies are over the top and the Cinnabuns with the maple syrup topping are amazing. I have had one of the breaksfast sandwiches and the only complaint I have is that the biscuit was just a little dry, however I would order it again because it was tasty,"}
{"text":"So I have never had a Cubano in my life. I know why, cause what the heck is a Cubano, right? Well let me tell you, it is one of my new top favorite sandwiches. Honestly, really really great. Fries here reminds me of five guys but these seem better to me. They have a wide variety of ice cream, dole whip, donachos, shakes, mini donuts, hot coco with whatever toppings you want, breakfast sandwiches, sundaes, cookies and personalized cakes. I will be back again and again to continue my taste journey through their menu. Prices are very reasonable. Go and enjoy and let me know how you like the CUBANO!!!!! Lol."}
{"text":"The owner was the rudest individual I've ever met. The ketchup was empty and I told him the Ketchup was empty and if he could please refill it. He said, \"your going to make me go to the back and get some more ketchup?\" I told him yes. When he came back he brought the whole tub of ketchup and slammed it on the table I was eating on and said here's your ketchup. Not only that when I asked for my money back he said to never come back again. It was my first time there and this is how I was treated. The food wasn't good and was especially over priced. I told him I'm the customer and shouldn't treat me like this. He failed to realize the advice I gave him was to help him even though he was absolutely rude with no concept of customer service or even performing necessary and standard job duties."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Not too bad prices with choices enought o make everyone happy. Two different flavors of Dole Whip!"}
{"text":"My hubby Keith and  I came to try this place out.  First time ever trying Poutine.Delicious!!! I'm hooked.. So many yummy things to try. Churro cookies are awesome and the cannolis are seriously amazing... I think one of the best I have ever had!!! Leonard is so friendly and you can tell that he really loves what he does! Thank you Leonard !!! See you tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"So so angry....that I have lived so close to this place and had not tried it yet!  Went in for the dole whip, so glad I found a place in the North.  Dole whip is crazy good!  Also ordered the poutine with bacon, again crazy good!  The ladies there were super nice and helpful.  Customer service was crazy good too!"}
{"text":"Sweet tooth heaven yes a warm doughnut with ice cream sooo yummy ,endless toppings and great selection of  thrifty ice cream. First time and the staff was supper friendly and welcoming!! They have the poutine fries which I will be coming back to try!"}
{"text":"I got the Canadian Sunrise on their homemade biscuit and a dozen different cookies!!! The biscuit is so soft and has excellent flavor! The egg was perfect and the Canadian bacon was soooo good!!!! This sandwich was large and very filling!!! I took the cookies to work and they were a huge hit!!! They were so moist the cookies and cream cookie was the best!!!! I am so excited that this bakery is open in my neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Everything is delicious (the french fries and poutine are AMAZING!) and the staff are wonderful! I'm so glad there's a real bakery and ice creamery in Centennial!"}
{"text":"Yum.  Delicious cookies.  Molasses dipped in chocalate, DIVINE!  Peanut butter and chocolate chip, SCRUMPTIOUS!  We'll  be back."}
{"text":"Grabbed breakfast this morning! Walked in for a Canadian Sunrise walked out with 2 lime bars, 2 cranberry dream bars, a sugar cookie, and a side of breakfast potatoes with my Canadian Sunrise! I just love this place!!!! The biscuit on the Canadian Sunrise is homemade daily and sooooo good! Moist and flaky but perfect to hold the contents of the sandwich!! If you haven't tried this place you must!!!!"}
{"text":"Love that we can get Dole Whip somewhere other than Hawaii and Disneyland! Great little shop with homemade donuts, cookies and a nice selection of ice creams and milkshakes. Friendly staff and very welcoming. Will be trying their breakfast menu soon!"}
{"text":"Kids always come here for the fresh mini donuts. They love to watch it be made. The cookies are good too. Definitely try them."}
{"text":"My gosh. I at first had a hard time finding this place (damn yelp map!) but got to it eventually. After reading the reviews and seeing the pictures I was looking forward to seeing lots of cookie bake goods when I walked in. Well I must of been late because there was mostly brownies and Cannoli shells. Nothing wrong with that but I really wanted to try some of the cookies I saw here at Yelp.
Going on, I also wanted to try the Poutine. I bought a regular order along with the green tea apple slushie. Also for checking in I got 3 free mini donuts. Everything was delicious!! That was my first time having poutine and it was so good! I have to try it with bacon next time. On my next visit I have to get there earlier to catch some of those amazing looking cookies."}
{"text":"The churro cookie! SO GOOD. I ate it in about 10 seconds. I also got the basic breakfast sandwich on the kaiser roll with canadian bacon. I wanted to get one of everything, maybe next time. Super friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwiches are pretty big, very tasty and at $4.75, well worth it over McDonalds or some other fast food breakfast. I came in to try the mini donuts but the machine was down and decided to give the sandwiches a try instead. Wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"wow!!! yummy to my tummy!!!! a new jewel of north las vegas...go!! Got the Munchies? This is the spot!!!!"}
{"text":"I loved this little bakery shop, great place to take your family for a quick treat, Savannah helped us out and she was very kind and everything tasted really good"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for the first time while waiting for the DMV and the people were super friendly. The Canadian sunrise was good! And the fresh mini donuts were warm and perfect. I'd definitely go back and bring my husband next time!"}
{"text":"Bakery items are fantastic!  Stopped in for some cookies and walked out with a Pokeball shortbread, Toffee Bar, Nanaimo Bar, Cranberry Bliss Bar, and a PB chocolate chip cookie all to take home.  Every time my husband tried a bite his eyes lit up and said, \"This is really good - where did you get it?  Why haven't I been there?!\"  Needless to say, we went back a couple days later.

When I asked for a military discount, she threw in a free cookie :)

All the girls (on both days) were super friendly and helpful explaining what was in each goodie (when it wasn't super obvious).

They also have a good selection of ice creams and a Canadian deli menu that I'll have to check out next time."}
{"text":"Great prices, friendly staff and delicious homemade cookie ice cream sandwiches!   We definitely found  our new favorite dessert place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Everything looks sooooo good. The cookies are soft and the ice cream is yummy."}
{"text":"This place is the best for a quick snack or meal. So cheap!! Love the selection of cookies for ice cream sandwiches, home made Canadian bacon so good too and poutine!!!  Tables on sidewalk too so you can bring your pooch :-)"}
{"text":"I was so impressed walking in. The young ladies working here are awesome A+ for customer service, which is important to me. My family and I tried the dole whip, ice cream sandwich, donut sundae, and mint chocolate chip ice cream. All extremely good. My only issue was the older lady came out of the back started cleaning/straighten tables, the one right next to us and never spoke, smiled nothing. We were the only ones in the shop. From reading other reviews maybe this was an off day for her. I will still give it another try, and go from there."}
{"text":"Anyone who gives this place less than five stars is just a miserable person. Especially the four-star people that have nothing but positive things to say but yet only put 4 stars. Sorry everybody's not into stroking your ego. But back to salted malted. Hands down the best bakery in Las Vegas. The owner cait goes out of her way to stop working to greet me and my family it's time we go in there. We have gone there so many times now that my kids run up to her and give her a hug every time they see her. And to top it all off the cookies, ice cream call donuts are amazing.  Not only the bakery items but we have had dinner there several times and it is absolutely incredible what cait has done to the menu. I would recommend this place to everybody. Once you go in there one time you will make it a weekly routine. Calories completely worth it. We love you cait"}
{"text":"Waffle sundae is HUGE and AMAZING!!!! Fresh baked goodness!!! We love it there. Super friendly people and some darn good cookies"}
{"text":"It wasn't a bad place. The service was friendly and the cookies and latte were OK. It is a popular place because after being there for about 10 minutes there was a really long line. Since it didn't really blow me away, I really don't see myself returning, especially since I don't live in the area."}
{"text":"We love this place, the food and staff are amazing!! Give them a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give -5 stars I would. The owner was completely rude. Needs to learn how to treat his customers with respect. Asking for ketchup because the ketchup was out doesn't give you the right to refuse service just because you are too lazy to go to the back and get more. It also isn't an excuse to slam ketchup of the table when you do refill it. We're putting money into your business and then want to treat someone rudely because you don't want to get ketchup. If you didn't refill it then someone would've asked for the same thing later."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel like Norm from Cheers! They always remember me....and I'm not even there everyday,  I swear! Best Maple bacon cookies ev! Great service from All the LADIES!"}
{"text":"This place is a MUST!! The homemade doughnuts are out of this world!! It honestly doesn't matter what time you go in... It's all SO DELICIOUS!!! 
  Their doughnuts, the breakfast sandwiches, the ice cream shakes, homemade ice cream sandwiches, cakes, and cookies, are ALL, AMAZING!! 
  **They also make homemade doggie treats, for your furry friends!! 
  This is definitely a family-owned and operated establishment; that makes you feel like you're family, the moment you walk in. Honestly, (as if you couldn't tell) I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food . I had egg and cheese on biscuit and my boy friend had the sausage egg, and cheese on a biscuit . I also had a sugar cookie that was delicious ! We want to come back and order the cinnamon rolls that are only made on the weekends . They suggest to pre order ."}
{"text":"Soon as we walked in the door we immediately received a greet from the staff & the sweet smell of dessert. I got the browning ice cream cookie with pecan praline and it was amazing! Come check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"the food and the friendly family service I received made me fill like home. Those cannolis were the best I've ever had. the owners came out and personally said hello and thanked me for stopping in. they also have poutin frys!!! love, love this place!! you will not be disappointed!  no microwaves in this place. all freshly made. Petes coffee also! I give them a 10 out of 5!!"}
{"text":"SALTED MALTED, HUNGER HALTED! Located on 215 & north decatur, this Canadian inspired place has a variety of sweet & savory specialties! The owners, a husband & wife duo, say their inspiration comes from a combination of an after-school snack, midnight munchies & lazy Sunday afternoon treats... Are you salivating yet?! They were also very welcoming and kind -- really exemplifying the ultimate customer service experience on our first time there and how a new business can make a lasting impression on customers. I was already sold on this place & I hadn't even tried anything yet! Not only that, but nothing is pre-packaged & everything freshly made... Their motto is \"SIMPLE + FRESH = BEST!\" Mmm.

Their menu is rather extensive, offering a bunch of fun items we have yet to try: waffles, customized soda pop, donuts, malts/shakes, coffee, sundaes, fries, poutines, sandwiches... and offer brands like Peets coffee & tea, Thrifty's ice cream, and Dole soft serve (which I no longer have to go all the way to Disneyland for! It's lactose/gluten/fat/cholesterol free, AND they offer pineapple, strawberry, mango, orange & raspberry flavors too!). We went with their mix-n-match cookies, where you choose your ice cream & sandwich it between two freshly baked cookies of your choice! I was excited to learn they make all their own cookie dough & they offer traditional favorites and also unique new ones! 

FOR HER:
- two white chocolate macadamia nut cookies x pistacio ice cream
FOR HIM: 
- peanut butter chocolate chip cookie + brownie cookie x vanilla ice cream

*We also tried out their churro cookies, which is what originally caught my eye. The owner said they don't keep shape for too long though, as they are very soft and much more like a cake than a cookie, & said, \"Promise me you'll eat these by tonight!\" They were beautifully crafted and full of cinnamon deliciousness!

100% satisfied, beginning to end. We'll definitely be back to try more on the menu! :)"}
{"text":"I've been dying to come here finally had a chance today. I can say right now without a shadow of doubt I will for sure be back. Pricing is great and the food even better. If you want to indulge in some Poutine come here it's so good, it was perfect the idea of the hot fries, gravy and than to have the cold cheese curds brought it all together. I will also add that everyone that works there makes you feel as though they have known you forever I love this place and I have a feeling so will you come in and make some new friends and eat great food."}
{"text":"We stopped by Salted Malted as a treat after my nephew's graduation and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. We sampled just about everything on the menu from the fresh donuts (cinnamon & sugar covered was my favorite), to the shakes, malts, grilled cheese combo (delicious and the fries were fresh cut!), ice cream cookie sandwich (the chocolate chip potato chip cookie was great), and poutine.  The staff was very friendly and patient (we had a big group and it was a first visit for all of us).  The seating area is small, but well worth squeezing in.  I look forward to another visit this summer!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I am so thrilled that a place of this quality has made it to this area! My friend and I sampled the dole whip, which is delicious. We also had a couple of cookies and ice cream. \"The Chipster\" is an excellent sweet and salty cookie and the ice cream is delicious too! I'll definitely be back o try out some of the Italian sodas and poutine!"}
{"text":"First time coming in. I'm from the Portland OR area and my favorite food cart up there makes amazing poutine. This was better. 

I got a large poutine with Canadian bacon. The large is HUGE. The bacon is outstanding. The frys taste really fresh and the curds are very tasty. I decided to get a shake with their mint chocolate chip ice cream. I'm picky about my mint chocolate chip ice cream but this is fantastic. 

The service was very friendly and down to earth. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place today for a quick breakfast for my kids. The place has excellent customer service. My toddler was given a free turkey cookie for his birthday. The donuts are really good and made fresh to order. No complaints."}
{"text":"We love this place, the poutine is yummy with the homemade Canadian bacon. Also, the namanio bar, abc bar, pumpkin cheesecake cookie, pumpkin latte cookie and carrot Cookie are amazing. The prices are reasonable and it's a great place to being the family for dessert."}
{"text":"Great food, lil quaint place n the employees are super friendly. I would recommend it to everyone"}
{"text":"Went there tonight with my family and they still had all of their pastries available. I love the many kinds of cookies and bars. Ice cream and Dole whip were very good. The pineapple Dole whip reminded me of Disneyland's. Great customer service. It's very pleasant and comfortable when you walk in. Everything's there on display for you to see and want. This is a must visit again."}
{"text":"Really loved the cookies, I ordered a selection of very interesting flavors. Now if only they could replicate Sprinkles pb pretzel and salted oatmeal cornflake, I'd have to visit far more often. The poutine was very good, too. My friend ordered a peach cannoli and said it was delicious. My only disappointment was they didn't have any unique ice cream flavors when I went, like their Web page had mentioned. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Oh man.  I cannot say enough good things about this place! There isn't one thing I have eaten there that hasn't been amazing. The Nanaimo bars are the best. I tried poutine for the first time. Their breakfast sandwiches are to die for. You have to go try it out!"}
{"text":"Cinnamon roll (American style) which is just cream cheese in lieu of (Canadian style) which is maple frosting was okay. Lots of frosting, which you can't complain about. Hope this place gets good business"}
{"text":"Got the Cubano and the American sunrise both were amazing.. Fried were great. My daughter got the blue velvet cookie and cotton candy ice cream and she loved it. Place is nice and food was amazing"}
{"text":"Great tasting poutine!! Service awesome super friendly staff.. Very clean restaurant .. Biscuits are hand made fresh everyday and are amazing!! Donuts are also fresh and amazing... Will totally come back and definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Literally one of my favorite mom and pops. Their classic and speciality cookies are always so gooey on the inside (which is how I prefer 'em). I can honestly say they have unique flavors that I haven't tried elsewhere. 

And I'll never forget the first time we dined in. The sweet owner offered my boyfriend and I a complimentary grilled cheese sandwich that we sure enjoyed!!"}
{"text":"Love this place - the customer service was outstanding and the food too. The made to order doughnuts rock and the cookies too!!"}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out last night and I fell in love. The interior was so cute and quirky, I'm such a sucker for contemporary and \"hip\" little shops. (not too many in Vegas) The workers that helped us were all so friendly and patient with us since we had no idea what to get. There's so many options!! I ordered a warm churro cookie with vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel. It was the perfect combo, thanks to the worker who recommended it to me! I believe my bf had a mint chip shake blended with a Canadian butter tart bar, which was really good. Lance (also the creator of PinkBox Doughnuts) gave us a complimentary \"Heartbreaker\" cookie while making conversation with us. Tasted just like the Fat Elvis but in my opinion, it was even better! 

I love the overall energy of this place. And only 5 minutes away from home? Very dangerous. I'll definitely be coming here often."}
{"text":"First time here and I am blown away. I got a last minute ice cream cake that was black cherry with a amazing crust. Customer service was awesome and very helpful. Definitely will be coming back to check out their breakfast and more treats."}
{"text":"Great owner who loves to come out and meet her customers! All the workers are super helpful in assisting me every time I come i and its always full inside, which has to mean something. I love their $1 grill cheese and their specialty cookies (my favorite is cookies and cream)! I love supporting small businesses and this is a great one to check out!"}
{"text":"So far, I've only been able to try the cookies, but my experience is every bit as rave-worthy as the other great reviews! Shop is small but clean, menu has baked and iced sweets, as well as some sandwiches and poutine. The fair prices belie the solid homemade quality and personable service. 

The display case of cookies immediately caught my attention, and I snagged a half-dozen and a few seasonal options to boot. BF and I nibbled on them for a few days and were consistently impressed with the inventive flavors.

The churro cookie was a winner for me, with the soft texture and light cinnamon-sugar accents. The PBC (peanut butter chocolate) was just what it should be, while a similar flavor with PB, chocolate, and banana (the Heartbreaker) was even more successful. The gingerbread was classic and cute, the maple-bacon was a nicely-balanced hit, and only the Chipster didn't resonate with us. 

Salted Malted is quite a trek across town for me, but I'll be looking for excuses to head north now that I know I can sneak in a trip here- will definitely be trying more as soon as I can!"}
{"text":"Great dessert place , whenever I go see my dentist I make sure I run in and buy a dozen or two cookies for the staff . It's a hit ! We all love it ! Glad it's just right around the corner from my home !"}
{"text":"Hot spot...the menu doesn't do the possibilities in this store any justice since the possibilities are endless.  Came here on Saturday after work and place is constantly busy. I took my time as I had a hard time settling on which I wanted. So I started with the Canadian Sunrise. I don't care that it's dinner time and I'm having breakfast. Well it's early somewhere. The biscuit was soft and fresh and the bacon is  cured or permeated(if that's right???) and very tender. I was given an I'm perfected shape mini donut that was already cooled and let me tell you, I just about died and went to heaven. Imagine it when they're warm as they normally serve them. OMG.
I've tried some of the cookies as well and they are also yummy. Very weird and unique flavors that somehow work so well together.  Staff is very friendly which is mandatory in my book. Anyway if you thought about it hurry up and get down here and try it."}
{"text":"Traditional & Fun ice cream shop - perfect for stopping by on afternoons and weekends."}
{"text":"Amazing food and awesome/kind people! Everything from breakfast to sandwiches to any dessert you can imagine! Will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"So good! So friendly! The owner and the employees really make it a great spot to check out! Cookies are so often fresh made and they have excellent savory options to choose from for lunch and dinner plus specials! Check out the Poutine! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to grab a coffee and a breakfast sandwich in Vegas. Get the Canadian Sunrise on a biscuit. The kids have loved the ice cream and cookies. This is a must visit every time I am in town. Friendly ownership and staff You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They have Dole pineapple soft serve, just like the Dole Plantation in Hawaii! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today. I got the Cubano and it was excellent. Great flavor and a great take on the classic Cuban. My girlfriend had a grilled cheese and she said it was the best grilled cheese she's ever had...and it was only $.99! The owner was very nice and sat and talked to us for a few minutes. Will definitely come back and dive into the desserts next time....worth every penny!"}
{"text":"My favorite goodie spot in Vegas!  Deserts are so amazingly delicious!  Cookies are moist, bars are delicious, dole whip is tasty.  I had a French dip and it was amazing.  So good!  Give it a try, you are welcome!"}
{"text":"Really nice cozy place. The owner is a friendly guy. Food was made fast. I literally just got in town and was going to the burrito spot next door and saw this place. The name made me curious. Turns out they have breakfast sandwiches and sweets. Definitely recommend visiting this family owned business"}
{"text":"Always a wonderful experience!!!! Great customer service, friendly all the time! I love this place, not to mention all the wonderful cookies and doughnuts!!!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! The people are so friendly. Huge selection of delicious desserts. Fancy cookies and Thrifty ice cream. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Where all your dessert dreams come true. Whatever your sweet tooth is craving, they have it. Donuts? Check. Cookies? Oh yeah. Ice cream? Yes. ICE CREAM COOKIE SANDWICHES? Double check! It's hard to decide what to order (that's a good thing k) but the employees are friendly and eager to offer up recommendations! Been twice now and have left both times with a happy feeling and a muffin top."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Their Canadian Sunrise sandwich is very tasty!  Haven't tried the poutine yet but will one of these days. They have AWESOME cookies and mini donuts. The only bad thing I can say is they don't open until 9am!"}
{"text":"What a gem! My husband and I stop by after dinner at the geisha house, and got some cookies and some ice cream. The cookies were absolutely delicious as was the ice cream. I couldn't stop thinking about it so I went back a couple days later to get some more cookies and tried out the grilled cheese. Only $.99 and a delicious sandwich! I could've added extra ingredients but was just in the mood for a plain grilled cheese. The service is spectacular and the options for breakfast, lunch or desserts is great. Can't wait to try the poutine and the Canadian bacon sandwiches. Five stars in deed!"}
{"text":"Poutine!  Delicious and authentic!  They also had sandwiches with hormone free cured in store Canadian bacon, mini donuts, ice cream, and made from scratch sweets!!

A coworker had told me about the Salted Malted serving poutine and I immediately knew that I had to stop in and try it. Unlike other poutine found in Las Vegas (with the exception of Smoke's), I was not disappointed!  True to traditional Canadian poutine, the skin on fries, curds, and flavorful gravy was delicious!!  I was happy to find other delicious options I plan to try in the near future too, like breakfast and lunch sandwiches, butter tart bars (and more), and ice creams!  Did I mention HOT & FRESH MINI DONUTS?  A must try...as an added bonus, the staff and owners were very friendly!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars, but if not for the mishaps, the food warranted a solid 4 stars.  I would characterize Salted Malted Bakery & Creamery as a place where you can eat dessert for dinner.  This definitely is a dessert place, but don't sleep on their savory offerings.  I didn't, which is why my review is more positive than it could have been.

If you're visiting Las Vegas and are looking to eat somewhere that isn't a buffet or on the busy strip, take a drive out to North Las Vegas to check out Salted Malted.  Salted Malted is owned by a Canadian lady, who according to one of the staff, passed down her recipes for the desserts and savory food.  The decor inside Salted Malted has a Canadian slant as their are Canadian flags hanging on the walls, Canadian figurines depicting life in Canada, and a framed Obama picture where the former President is questioning what poutine is.  There are a few tables and chairs where you can enjoy your food, but it would be hard pressed to accommodate a large party.  Salted Malted also pays homage to America with their pictures of American icons.  It really has a homey, cute ambience inside.  I loved the picture right above the ice cream cold box depicting a cow talking to a carton of milk saying, \"Milk, I am your father.\"

The main reason why I would have rated Salted Malted with less than desirable ratings was it running out of stuff that a dessert place should never run out of.  My daughter ordered a banana split, but after placing the order, the employee helping us told us that they ran out of bananas.  My wife ordered a cookie sundae, but they ran out of several styles of cookies she wanted.  Their excuse was that on this President's Day Monday, they got swamped.  A dessert/ice cream place should never run out of bananas and cookies.  Salted Malted's saving grace was their poutine fries with Canadian bacon.  OMG!!!  Their poutine fries are of the must order variety.  I was a poutine fries virgin and after my first time experience, I am so glad I devoured this Canadian superstar of a dish.  For the uninformed, poutine fries is drenched with finger licking good gravy, packed with thick, yummy cheese curds, engulfed with a healthy amount of Canadian bacon, all of which cover thick cut, seasoned fries.  Poutine fries, where have you been all my life?!!!????  I can confidently say that this dish was the best thing I ate during our 4-day stay in Las Vegas.

Salted Malted could have easily been a 5 star Yelp establishment, which practically has this rating from the Yelp reviewers who have eaten here.  For me, I took them down a notch based on them running out of dessert essentials and for not anticipating being busy on a holiday Monday.  Salted Malted redeemed itself with its Canadian awesomeness of a dish aka poutine fries.  Loved this dish, eh?"}
{"text":"Everything is delicious!  The prices are reasonable.  They definitely need more chairs inside.  My only complaint is the ice cream was a little too soft and fell out of the ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"Keeping it brief great help and all the menu items I've tried were wonderful. Hope to return soon and excited about Popcorn Girl soon to open next door."}
{"text":"Maple Bacon cookie....I love you! In an era of mass-produced baked goods, you NEED to try the real thing. That means you MUST go to the Salted Malted. We tried all the kinds of cookies they had, on our first visit, and they all tasted like the ones grandma made when you were little....only they are HUGE. And decadent. And the perfect chewy--gooey--crisp texture. My favorite is the Maple Bacon (could you tell??). The bacon is noticeable in a good, rich salty way; and I would say the other ingredient is more like a caramel, both in the cookie and drizzled on top. For my husband, they had Dole Whip. And ice cream creations. To cut all the sweetness, they had fresh-cut fries with gravy and various toppings (a.k.a. Poutine). 
Just go get some. But save a churro cookie for me...they were out of them when we went. Ah well...what a great excuse to return!"}
{"text":"Pouting fries are fresh and very good. Service is always awesome and the donuts don't get fresher!"}
{"text":"Really nice people here! We got 2 shakes brownie walnut and a chocolate malt both were really good I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was such a treat. The owner is so friendly as well.  A really nice place and it's not a chain."}
{"text":"The cookies here are great. Loved then pumpkin bars and banana cookies. Pretty far but worth the drive."}
{"text":"Lived the pineapple whip and Thrifty Ice Cream. Poutine....well, I tried it. Will be back for breakfast and more whip!!"}
{"text":"Come check this Bakery and Creamery out!! We love the prices and the specialty cookies! I got the cookie w potato chips in it! Yum! My daughter loved her waffle cone sundae. And they serve sandwhiches too. We ordered 3 grilled cheese, super cheap but amazing buttery flavor with a crunch. I still can't understand how the prices are like 1980's?? My new FAVORITE addiction is this place!

Order your pies now for Thanksgiving, they even have a S'more pie?!! :)"}
{"text":"Everything they sell is delicious.  I love their hot mini doughnuts.  Awesome to have a place like this in Aliante! Just dropping my stars down slightly; just want to see the little place a bit cleaner;still good desert:)"}
{"text":"Really delicious! The owner was very nice and threw in a couple of cookies for me to try! Loved the cinnamon roll cookie with caramel drizzle. I came in at the end of they day when they where closing and my cookies were still fresh and tasty! Great place to go."}
{"text":"They serve the thrifty ice cream for all the diehard fans, make fresh tiny donuts that are Delish . The cookies are good not great but in all fairness I'm not much of a pastry person staff was friendly and accommodating"}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab something sweet. First time visit. Got an ice cream sandwich. Boy was it better than the high priced Tollhouse cookie you get on the strip or in Town Square. I'm glad Yelp showed me this little joint."}
{"text":"This place is great. Prices are so reasonable and the products are delicious. I have tasted more than a few of their cookies. All of them were awsome. Staff is super nice, which is even better."}
{"text":"Walking in you can just feel the authenticity of the food items and menus - this place serves everything from ice cream, extremely tasty soft serve, baked goods, freshly fried mini doughnuts, to Cuban sandwiches and freshly cut fries.

I tried the Cubano sandwich, with a side of fries, pineapple and mango dole whip soft serve, and white chocolate covered cinnamon sugar mini doughnuts.

If you're a fan of Five Guys you'll know what these fries will taste like - freshly cut salted in a bowl and placed in a paper cut. Top it with gravy, cheese curds and bacon and you're in for a stellar Poutine.

The soft serve was fantastic - the place opened in September and I can imagine the dole whip machines are new - but the soft serve was a very creamy and cool consistency. I took one to go and the soft serve held it's shape for entire trip home. When I got to Disney World, the must have is the pineapple dole whip - this place is right in my backyard serving the exact same consistency! Next time I'll bring some pineapple juice to place the soft serve in and I'll be on my own mini vacation!

As for the mini doughnuts - they have more than 10 toppings from chocolate sauce to cinnamon sugar/ powdered sugar. Any mix and they'll happily give you samples. They have the dough and mini fryer that the little kids love to watch - nothing beats fresh!

In general I hesitate to find places that serve way too many products - but this place puts focus and attention to everything that is come here for breakfast lunch and desert in one stop. 

Genuinely I hope they keep up the spectacular quality in the long run and keep serving strong - time will tell if they permanently make their mark so check it out now and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a winner. Cheap delicious treats for after dinner. Nice people and clean cafe atmosphere. Great place!"}
{"text":"I'm cruising on my bicycle today so I don't feel too bad about the Canadian butter bar and poutine I just ate. Add on a grilled cheese, matcha green apple slush, and a frosted shortbread cookie that looks like a jack o' lantern and we had a comfort food feast for under $12. Salted Malted has the best food deals in Las Vegas. Don't forget to download Perka so you can earn a $7 credit after spending $50.

From the unique cookie selection, I love the malt crunch and chipster for the savory notes balancing the sweetness. The pumpkin latte and carrot cake cookies are my other favorites. These fresh baked cookies will make you regret any day old cookie ever consumed, and break ties with the baker who dared serve you inferior expired product. I just tried the Canadian butter bar, which the owner described as being like pecan pie without pecans. I like to think of it as crack pie with raisins, because I'm addicted. And I always need my green drink, the self-serve one labeled matcha green apple slush.

Run, don't drive, to Salted Malted."}
{"text":"Churro, strawberry cheesecake, carrot cake, oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip and more! Gourmet cookies at their finest! Great service and amazing treats! They also have the cutest little donuts that can have a variety of sugar sprinkled over them. 

What?! There's more!? Ice-cream and dole whip! Food and french fries made in a gluten free process coming soon! Love, love, love!

How can we get Salted Malted on a Cookie Wars competition on Food Network?! ;-)"}
{"text":"This place is my 2nd home! Being from Canada I am so happy that Salted Malted exists! The poutine is delicious. The gravy is perfection and don't get me started on the cheese curds! I love having a Canadian family place to attend when I am home sick! The sweets are also delicious and I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone! Cait and Leonard are the owners and have done such a fantastic job! Salted Malted is a must try place!"}
{"text":"Brownie cookie is a gooey middle with a crispy outside. Dark chocolate deliciousness is all i can say. Hubs loved the cookies and cream cookie. We are excited to try the rest of our cookies later on. We will be back to try the sandwiches and poutine. 

We tried the churro cookie and it is heaven. Highly recommended to all and the staff is fantastic."}
{"text":"Again we found them through restaurants.com, we had no issues using the certificate. The ice cream is pretty good, I was very happy to see that they had chocolate malt crunch from thrifty's. They also have amazing cookies! My favorite was the molasses one! We were only there to try desserts but they also have food. They have fresh made mini donuts which made the store smoky but it smelled really good."}
{"text":"Came back in to try this place out again, I ordered the mini donuts and got half glazed and half with cinnamon sugar. The donuts really are mini, like bite sized donuts but since I got a dozen I was satisfied with the amount that I had. Both were very yummy. 

I also got their churro cookies which tastes as good as it looks aesthetically. It tastes pretty close to having a churro as far as taste goes and it has a glaze drizzled on top that ties in the flavor together really well. I'm interested in trying the other baked goods that they have next time I'm in town.

They have so many options to choose from so it has a little bit of everything for anyone who is in the mood for something different. So overall, I definitely had a better experience than before."}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant that is family owed. Decor is very Canadian influenced aka Canadian pride,lol. You can play boardgames while you wait for your food that's provided by the bakery. They have a large selection of Italian style sodas and Canadian specialties i.e.  Butter tart, Poutine and house made Canadian bacon.

My boyfriend and I decided to try the poutine of course and he had a Italian soda and I had a malted chocolate shake. Also order beef on wet sammach to split. Poutine poutine poutine why have I never tried you sooner it was great!! Choco malt shake reminded me of my childhood. Beef on wet was on the salty side for our taste but was manageable.

The staff is very friendly and do there best to make sure that the food and drinks are to the customers liking. We will definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!!!! I am so sad that they are closing!!!!!! They truly have the best cookies in town!!! The owners are so nice, kind, and caring! I am so saddened by this news!!!!!!!!! I am sad I posted this review so late we have been doing to this bakery every week since they have opened!!!!!! The staff is always so nice and friendly as well!! I wish you luck in the future. I hope you will be back someway somehow."}
{"text":"Everything was so yummy! The owner was the sweetest, most welcoming person! I would be a regular if I lived there."}
{"text":"Stopped by this morning, the place is awesome, comfortable & smells incredible! Had the Canadian sunrise sandwich & it was fresh & yummy! Biscuit was incredible. Just a cool little place to stop!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars almost nearly based off of service.

The place is one of the only Canadian themed creamery slash bakery in town. Their entire menu is extremely affordable and fresh!

I tried to poutine fries and Canuck sandwich. I felt both were pretty okay-ish but again the service was where this place excels! Mom as I called her (haha) was extremely sweet and knowledgeable both on Canadian facts and let us sample a lot of their desserts then gave us free dole samples and a cookie. 

..and here I was telling myself I was gonna diet? Lol

Thanks mom! Awesome service!! manners maketh the establishment, eh?"}
{"text":"Actually the cutest place I have ever been to. The only place on this side of town that serves dole whips (VEGAN). They have a super nice and friendly staff and tons of options-- including homemade dog treats!-- all at great prices. Everything I had was delicious! I will be going again."}
{"text":"I'm writing a 3-star because I used to come here pretty often before. Dole whip, sandwiches, and fries were so good and I loved getting a chocolate malt shake. Quality was really good and I remember the female owner making an amazing grilled cheese. 

Today I went in with a craving before work to have some breakfast. I ordered a canadian sunrise, fries, and a dole whip to go. The employees were talking to each other while working which isn't bad, the place was empty and they already took care of me. When I was waiting for my food, more people came in and it got a little busy. The cook came out and set my food down without a word and paced right back in the kitchen. I work in food service so I'm pretty understanding. Maybe she was tired, maybe she was busy working on other tickets and had a lot to do. It's alright with me but I never got my dole whip. Went back in line and the cashier apologized and served me after the other people. I probably came when it was bad timing. Cashier was very sweet though. 

What brings this review down was my food itself. The fries were okay but the biscuit was very doughy, raw and mushy even though it was charred on the outside. The sandwich wasn't what I remembered. I thought maybe I had a fluke. I called a couple times to try letting them know but no one picked up the phone. I urge the staff to check food quality and when things aren't up to par, communicate with the customer. I personally don't mind waiting extra time."}
{"text":"So happy to find this gem in our neighborhood. Great priced bakery and creamery and they even serve breakfast and lunch! They make the best cinnamon sugar mini donuts. No need to travel to Cali for some dole whip either... They have it here! Family owned and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Employees were extremely nice! The ice cream, donuts, and cookies were sweet and delicious!"}
{"text":"Very affordable, great tasting cookies and ice cream! The cookies have a very salty taste but are still good. I was able to get an ice cream sandwich for only $3!"}
{"text":"The malted chocolate shake was bomb! My wife enjoyed every bite of her churo chocolate malt crunch sandwich.  Great customer service!!"}
{"text":"First off you could not ask for friendlier service. My family felt like we were long friends with the staff before we left. It was terrific! 
The treats and ice cream are so yummy. And the pricing is very reasonable.
We enjoyed a malt, sundae, cookie sundae, cannoli, Canadian butter tart, cake pop and napoina? I can't recall the name of that last treat but it was delicious!
My family and I plan on making this a routine stop when we're in town. 
Thanks!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, the atmosphere here is that of being at a family members or close friends home. Thanks to the incredibly friendly and efficient staff/owner just being in this establishment is a pleasant experience. 
The food. We had the American breakfast and it was because of the quality of ingredients and excellent craftsmanship of these breakfast sandwiches that this establishment has instantly become my go to for family breakfast.
The Poutine at this establishment leaves me short of words in its pure perfection. Both visually pleasing and an absolute joy to consume yet simple in its design, this dish will have me coming back for more time and time again. Lastly the Donachos, such a unique dish I had to indulge. The doughnuts are made fresh right at the counter then covered in a plethora of toppings making it as much of a visual feast as a decadent treat. 
There are so many other amazing looking fresh made treats here that I wish I had two stomachs and ten pages to properly sample and then report on this establishments delicacies."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! 
Great ice cream and the girls behind the counter had great customer service and were extremely friendly!!! 

After spending $25 on ice cream for my family and my sister spending on hers, we over stayed our welcome and were asked to leave because other paying customers had to go sit in the sitting area outside. We came here after dinner to celebrate my mothers 55th birthday and were just enjoying some time together.  

Although it was asked politely, we were paying customers also and had already given up a table and chairs without being asked. 

It sucks that because the business is small and there are not enough seats when they get busy you may be asked to leave if you have been there too long. Maybe they could have offered us chairs to sit outside if we wanted to stay. 

So we will not be back because it's embarrassing to be asked to leave an establishment when you have done nothing wrong except give the business your time and money! Especially when the family next you to yours of 5 isn't asked to leave!"}
{"text":"Dole Whip. Mango/Pineapple blend. I am in love. Can't get enough. Also the Nutella Brownie was a great choice"}
{"text":"Nice treat! The name is what drew us in and then reading the reviews we decided we must try. I love poutine and so we started with that and although they were very yummy I have had better in Eugene Oregon. They had so many choices for sweet treats it was hard to decide. I ultimately went for just ice cream in a come. The ice cream was very good but really wanted an ice cream sandwich which you can pick the cookies and the ice cream etc. Maybe another time. Very friendly staff and if you check in you get 3 free mini donuts!"}
{"text":"Great little place that has awesome food and customer service.  They really care about the quality and flavor of everything they make....and Dole Whip too!   All food is priced very reasonably as well.  Don't overlook this hidden gem in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ordered a chocolate and pistachio cannoli. They said they are made to order which is true. But what they don't tell you is that they take over 10min to make. I have to say though besides the wait, the owner and the shop workers are really nice. Their ice creams look handmade and the cookies look to die for. They also have Churro cookies and lots of smoothie/shakes with any flavor mix ins and or ice cream you could dream of. 
What seems to be the most popular when I was there was the soda mix ins!

I personally am not a sweet tooth person but it was def tempting to pick up almost everything in the display cases. Def one of the best dessert places in the northside of town. It is cute and quaint and def a cute date night place. Even a day date!"}
{"text":"We love Salted Malted. Wonderful service,  and their cookies are the absolute best! My kiddos love the ice cream sandwiches! They also have delicious Canadian treats! We stop by often and love sharing this secret on North Decatur with friends."}
{"text":"I love this place. Owners are incredibly nice and chat with everyone that comes in. Their staff is energetic and helpful. Love the pineapple dole whips. Prices are great compared to a $6.50 gelato I had at the Venetian Thursday night  which was horrid. Support these guys, they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Really nice and friendly people. They have a bunch of different creative cookies and also a mini doughnut machine. If it was not so far i'd go a lot more."}
{"text":"I have been here on a few occasions now and I can't say enough great about place!  I grew up close to the Canadian border and was able to enjoy a lot of things they have on the menu.  The poutine is to die for, the Canuck sandwich is amazing, and they have great sweets.  The only downfall is that it is so far from my house!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! The mini cinnamon sugar donuts are amazing!!! Cookies are delish too!!! Going back to try the poutine next week!"}
{"text":"I had the poutine and then handmade gravy and local bacon made me fall in love. I have enjoyed the cookies and grilled cheeze that has that amazing bacon. They also have Dole Whip and fresh mini doughnuts that meltbin your mouth."}
{"text":"The moment you walk in you automatically get a nice little family bakery sense to the whole area. We ordered the poutine and my god, it's delicious. 

When I was eating poutine it was a struggle to keep it from not being messy. I practically shoved my face into the gravy and cheese, it was that good. Families kept coming in, which shows they make good quality food. 

They have little games you can play with your friends which makes it enjoyable to stay and talk with family and friends. The service was great and you can tell they enjoyed their job. 

I will definitely come back. Just make sure to crank up the A/C since the summer is in full effect."}
{"text":"This place rocks! We ordered the grilled cheese with bacon (delicious) and poutine(Double delicious) as well as some amazing ice cream to end our night. The food is delicious, the staff and owner so incredibly nice and welcoming, we really couldn't think of a better way to end our day! 

Thank you salted malted for a great ending to date night! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Just had caramel macchiato from Salted Malted and it was honestly as good if not better than Stabucks. Since Starbucks left the shopping center Salted Malted increase options with coffee and other products. The coffee taste amazing and the macchiato was perfect. I recommend trying a cup of coffee and fresh homemade cannoli. The cream used for the cannoli is true and authentic better than any other bakery I have been to. If you have not been lately I highly recommend you visiting Salted Malted this weekend.  Great work and I will be returning."}
{"text":"The owner welcomed us in when we were looking at the menu outside. She was very kind the poutine fries are to die for! Everyone is very nice at all of the food is amazing! They give you samples while you're sitting in eating BTW they have Dole Whip!!!"}
{"text":"Walking by, my husband and unnoticed a sign that said \"Sunday Cinnabuns for sale\". My husband being the cinnamon lover that he is, entered.

When entering the atmosphere smelled of sweet mini donuts mixed with a bit of a smoky atmosphere (hood from stove?). Anyway I ordered a cubano and my husband ordered poutine, fries, cheese curds and gravy.  They were out of the cinnamon rolls :(. My cubano had Canadian bacon, mustard, pickles on a ciabatta bread.  It was very tasty.  

The people are very friendly, the food isn't bad, just a little dry, but the abc bar was awesome and they serve Peet's coffee!

One more thing, what's dinner without a game of battleship?"}
{"text":"I love their mint chocolate chip ice cream! It's not like other mint chocolate chip ice cream where it feels like an overwhelming number of chocolate chip chunks. It's hard to explain, but if you like mint ice cream, I definitely suggest to try it! 

The potato chip cookie is unique & the flavors surprisingly blends together pretty well. 

As for the churro cookie, it doesn't taste as much of a churro as I expected."}
{"text":"Incredible business. I am in trouble. Talented baker. I had the s'more bar and regular size poutine. I added the Canadian bacon.  I can't eat it all. While not a poutine fan because I can't stand the flavor of jarred gravy, they are right up there as tolerable/doable. I tried because of the rave reviews. I guess it just isn't my thing. Not their fault. They offer just the fries, which are bomb.  Get those! They offer dipping sauces such as garlic aoli, Cajon ketchup,  fry sauce,  Sriracha mayo, ranch. ...
Fyi, they open at 9, not 7:30 like I read on another review. 9-9

This is remiss of an old school malt counter in a drug store. Containers of toppings, 17 or so, line a shelf behind the ice cream case. Above that are colored bottles of shaken dry toppings and they also offer syrup flavorings.  These are all for sundaes, shakes and malts. But wait,  there's more!  Ice cream cakes, cookies that look that they'll be my new best friends and........DOLE WHIP!!!!! YES!!!! just what we need up here in the NW that we were missing!  
Oh, and sandwiches and a biscuit offering for breakfast.  I wish they opened early enough to bring my son here before school.
Great place,  though. Get here.  :)"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great ice cream.  We live on Washington/Torrey Pines. Worth the drive. I highly recommend going. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"My daughter and I decided that we were going to make a lap around all of the local shopping centers and try out new places. We ended up at The Salted Malted Bakery and Creamery. We got a Smore's bar, two of their Canadian baked pastries and two Dole Whips  and a Strawberry Whip. They taste so good! They are dairy free and have no extra ingredients. They are pretty much just whipped fruit and air. I am so excited because I am lactose intolerant and I am very picky with what I eat. They have an assortment of ice cream, cookies, donuts and other pastries. They also do breakfast. We will  back and try it out another day."}
{"text":"The mini donuts are amazing! Made fresh to order they just melt in your mouth, and you can even add any toppings that you like - I prefer the traditional powdered sugar. I don't know of anywhere else in town that serves these. The owners are very friendly and welcoming along with their staff. You can tell right away that they really enjoy helping their customers and making sure everyone is happy. The ice cream sandwiches are pretty amazing too - made with fresh cookies baked throughout the day. They are even offering fresh from scratch homemade pies for Thanksgiving - I put in an order for 3! I have been there twice so far and will definitely be back again soon!! Keep up the good work Salted Malted Team!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. The store was spotless. The soft serve sample comes in a baby come, so cute and eco friendly. They have thrifty ice cream and can make any cookie into an ice cream sandwich. Bacon maple, churro, pumpkin latte, strawberry cheesecake cookies. They also have regular flavored cookies. Very tasty and a dozen cookies $8. Coffee can be flavored and matcha green apple slushie drink which I've never seen before. I am not a fan of the bacon but my friends enjoyed it, as always I tried everything. The churro ice cream sandwich WOW. Thrifty ice cream, chocolate malted crunch is here. It's in the north but worth the drive.  I bought them out so I can't get a good picture. Fresh baked  so they are making more right now. My new sweet spot. Thank you."}
{"text":"Love it there. Family owned and you can feel the effort and love they have for their business. The bubble gum ice cream and sugar cookies were a big hit with my kids!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I tried to give these guys a review a month or so ago and the Yelp powers that be decided my review was not appropriate, or fake I guess because it was never posted. Hopefully this one gets through. 

We found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out. It is a family owned quaint little eatery that focuses on ice cream, home made cookies, and donuts. You can also get sandwiches here. We came in for a toasted cheese and Canadian bacon sandwich. It was great. It needed some soup with it though so I suggested that they add some tomato soup to the menu and they said they would. 

We've come back several times for ice cream or coffee and donuts. They have these great miniature donuts that are the bomb. Sometimes we will just stop by for a cup of coffee and donuts. The owners are great. The wife is named Kate and she sits and talks to the customers and makes you feel at home. It would be a shame that some place like this would not thrive. Stop on by get some ice cream, or get some cookies, or get some coffee and donuts and sit for a while. 

You will thank me later."}
{"text":"Why has the review taken so long? 

This Canadian themed bakery and cafe offers so many things to snack on it's crazy. Cookies, dole whip, ice cream, Canadian bacon breakfast sammies, and Poutine! Who doesn't like French Fries, gravy, and cheese curds? Plus you get free mini donuts with a Yelp check-in, just make sure you show the check-in to the owner, who I'm sure is behind the counter. 

SAVORY BREAKFAST: 
Go with the \"Canadian Sunrise\" sandwich. Seared Canadian Bacon, a fried egg, and cheese all on a tasty biscuit. The biscuits are made in house, they are super flaky, buttery, and like a soft little pillow you just want to snack and sleep on all at the same time. 

COOKIES: 
Eat all the cookies! - Seriously, they're all good, but a few of the stand outs are the Blue Velvet, Oreo Cream, M&M, Chocolate Potato Chip and just to mix it up get a few of their cannolis. Oh my god, I usually don't like cannolis, but these are awesome and addicting. Crispy fried sweet crust filled with an amazing cream that I just couldn't get in my mouth fast enough, (insert porn joke here). 

The thing that really makes this shop special is the husband and wife team who own and run it. They do everything from baking, serving, scooping, and making sure you leave with a belly full of happiness. Cheers!"}
{"text":"It's impossible not to like this place. 
Come here for:
Ice cream
Mini Donuts
Cookies
Poutine
Sandwiches

For staff, there must be a requirement that you have to be the sweetest person ever to work here. Cassidy, gave me a menu run down and helped me with recommendations. Service here is top notch. Beyond helpful and sweet. 

Cookies here are a little over a buck each. Chocolate chip cookie was super indulgent. Chocolate melts in your mouth, and they cut their cookieswith shortening to get that crispness. Make sure to use a napkin! 

Poutine. I got some today in honor of Justin Trudeau. A regular for $5 is PLENTY of food for a whole meal. Fries have some skin on them and were crisp, yet tender and hot. Salty and addicting. 

I'm not a fan of the Nanaimo bar. While the concept is delicious, OH MY GOD it is the only thing sweeter than the staff. I couldn't even convince myself to eat more than half since it was just too sweet. (... Believe me, I tried.) Perhaps best served with a cup of bitter coffee and two shots of insulin. 

Definitely recommend you stop by if you are nearby. A great little addition to the north side."}
{"text":"We've been coming to the cute bakery/ice cream shop since they opened and we've always been treated like VIP my kids have been taken on a tour of the kitchen and always speak highly of Cait. Everything we've tried cookies, brownies, donuts, sundaes, milkshakes, dole whips, ice cream sandwiches have been delicious. We're so sad to see this establishment close. We are making our last visit today with sad kids who always ask to visit the salted malted."}
{"text":"i had the churro cookie and i was supposed to share it,  i didn't, my taste buds told me not to and it was worth it,  i'm coming back tomorrow to buy more"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Friendly & outgoing employees, unique & luscious treats coupled with prices that don't make you wanna turn around and walk back out the door! You guys who live near this shop are lucky!! After reading so much about Salted Malted on Yelp and Insta, my family and I decided to take a drive all the way from Silverado Ranch to try this place out and we were not disappointed. Still thinking about that blue velvet & carrot cake cookie we tore into, make sure to try these especially!"}
{"text":"Free mini donuts if you checked in!!! When they say \"mini\" its like REALLY tiny lol


I ordered the poutine and its good. The cheese added some extra taste and texture. The gravy is also tasty and for the amount of food they give is pretty worth it. 

I tried their pastries and it tasted homemade. It doesnt \"wow\" me but its not bad.

The place itself is clean and they really represent Canada all over the store. I think they need more chairs and tables though. Also the staff are friendly and they all look young. Its like girls scout but older version lol.

I'll definitely come back again to try other things"}
{"text":"I heard about this place by word of mouth and after looking at all the mouth watering items on Yelp and finding out they sold real Canadian poutine I had to check it out. I ordered the cubano sandwich which had pickles, cheese, canadian bacon all in between two slices of this awesome tasting bread I've never had before, it was really good. I had to order the poutine which I've seen on tv over and over but never knew where to order some without having to buy a passport. I took my first bite and now I can't wait to have it again. Try it with bacon!, you can thank me afterwards. The gravy was good, fries were cooked just right and the cheese curds were slightly melted in with all that delicious bacon! They get five stars from me cause the service was great and very friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Perfect for Friday Family Nights. Extremely busy, but the staff is quick and super attentive to the customers' needs. The only thing I didn't agree with was the baker's attitude, you could totally tell she is just a grumpy lady and her attitude with her coworkers is just rude...take note baker lady, you never know who is watching. But I do have to say she was pretty nice to the customers so in a sense that's good, but I also believe that you need to be respectful and courteous to your co-workers as well so that was my only thing apart from that it's an amazing place and you can definitely tell that everything is homemade secret recipe kind of stuff I would definitely recommend it to anybody who's looking for a fun Friday with the family or a cute first date!"}
{"text":"Have you tried their dole whip? I mean HAVE YOU?? It's amaze-balls. The perfect combination of tart and sweet. It'll keep you craving more. I like to get a twist of the pineapple and mango. It's light and fluffy too-- HOW were they able to make it taste like that will always be a mystery to me. Now I gotta go get me some more."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough about every person that works there. Very warm and friendly and it isn't fake. Yes everything we ate was good but we will be back for service."}
{"text":"Cookies just like grandma used to make. Tried the macadamia white chocolate and maple bacon. They were so good and chock full of goodies. Definitely, no skimping here. I also liked that they all were a little different and not uniform and crumbly like grocery store cookies. They were even fresh late in the evening.  Service was great and the atmosphere was casual with good vibes. Loved the hosers miniatures of Bob and Ted McKenzie on the case (yes, I'm old enough to remember them, lol).  The best little cookie bakery in Vegas and an excellent value! I will definitely be back to try some of their other treats."}
{"text":"Really great food and very friendly staff! I highly recommend trying the poutine with bacon. They freely bake lots of yummy tempting treats. If you're on a diet forget it, you'll want more! 
I wish they were in Summerlin"}
{"text":"I was craving poutine after a trip from Vancouver, so I decided to check this place out. I was greeted by the really friendly staff, and it felt a lot like the hospitality you get up from Canada. 

Anyway, the poutine was bomb! I also liked how the served it in the cardboard boxes like they do up North. Really cool place!"}
{"text":"So far.....SO GOOD! Stopped in last night and I was not disappointed. Everyone working was great, so inviting and explained everything so well. You can tell they have the passion to be in the Industry. The cookies I had were amazing, soft and chewy and full of flavor. I can't wait to come back and try the donuts and dole whip. Thanks for opening a great little dessert shop in my neck of the woods!!!!"}
{"text":"This place opened up right next to the house and it's THE ONLY place I've ever seen Dole Whip (outside of Disney Land) - I haven't tried anything else but I do like my Dole Whip - if you haven't tried it - get some today!"}
{"text":"First time here, and my boyfriend and I literally made it just in time before they closed! I was ecstatic to have finally made it to the bakery after trying to make it out for a whole week to satisfy my sweet tooth. 
Anyway, the excitement got the best of me and I basically got one of every cookie... I do not regret my actions. 

Highlights:
1. Ambiance and service: no doubt, 5 stars. Even though they were about to close, we were genuinely welcomed with big smiles as if they just opened instead. Clean, cafe-type set up yet feels homey/inviting like I could spend a couple hours there studying with coffee and cookies :)
2. Churro cookie: , a MUST TRY/BUY at every visit! The texture was a pleasant surprise that I definitely didn't expect out of a cookie. 
3. Cookies in general: definitely can tell they are fresh baked daily. All soft and chewy, with crunchy edges, pleasing all types of cookie lovers. I ended up getting a churro, maple bacon, blue velvet, cookies &a cream, salted cashew, gingersnap, m&m, macadamia nut, and the chipster cookies. Each were true to their names in terms of flavor. 
4. Ice cream: my boyfriend ending up getting 2scoops of coffee ice cream. Rich but still moreso on the sweet side for ice cream. I tried the pecan praline, still on the sweet side for me, so I'd have to add some peanuts on top to balance it out. 
5. They have breakfast and hot foods! Wasn't able to try it per my timing, but after trying their sweet treats, I'm excited to try their donuts and hot meals :)

I highly recommend everyone to come by and satisfy your sweet tooth or cookie cravings. I, myself, can't wait to go back and try the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"I'm giving two stars based on my 1 visit to this place first I will say the staff were all extremely friendly which was nice but let's face it you go to a bakery in hopes of getting something amazingly tasty not for the nice people. So I got a chocolate malt which was way too liquidity first off and not blended well enough either I could honestly make my own chocolate malt at home that tastes way better and is allot cheaper. Second my husband got the s'mores bar and the mini donuts which the s'mores bar was ok and the donuts were good but once again I could make my own at home that tastes way better and is allot cheaper.  I won't give them another try mostly because their 20 minutes away from me and my first experience there was nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Delicious, soft, fresh home made cookies! It was pretty busy but customer service was nice. Affordable, not too pricey! I love the cookies n' cream, white chocolate cranberry, chocolate peanut butter chip and the hubby liked the maple bacon! Will be back when I'm craving cookies :)"}
{"text":"Went to this new place for date night- great service, awesome malt... and brought home some great cookies for the kiddos.  Prices are reasonable, and staff is really friendly and helpful- they took a lot of time with us to try flavors, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Happened to be at dinner next door and stopped in here see if anything looked good for dessert. Very welcoming shop, smelled amazing when we walked in. Staff were very friendly and we ended up getting some ice cream and fresh donuts. All of it tasted wonderful, we will definitely be back to try all the other things on the menu! Great find, looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Finding Poutine in Vegas is hard. Luckily after a bunch of research, I stumbled upon this place and was excited when it wasn't too far of a drive. Poutine was very good, great portion for the price, and it was a nice environment inside."}
{"text":"Have gone here twice. I've purchased the putine fries with Canadian bacon and and cone (caramel). My sister got a dole whip. Putine fries were pretty good! The presentation wasn't exactly the prettiest but it was tasty nonetheless and the ice cream was good too!

There's barely any seating inside though so if you're looking to sit down and enjoy, don't count on it as there are only 3-4 tables. Visually, inside looks pretty cool until you start noticing little things here and there..... the glass where the pastries are is pretty greasy and also a lot of the writing on the glass is smudged off which makes it look dirty. If they fixed that everything would be great tho!

Definitely worth to check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago, and let me tell you. 

Ordered large poutine with bacon and a lemonade, was given the mini donuts without even showing yelp!  The food was great, everything I wanted from viewing the menu online!

What really got me was the service. My friend and I were personally greeted by everyone in the restaurant. It really added a personal touch to the experience.

If you're thinking of eating here I recommend it wholeheartedly. This visit felt more like being welcomed into someone's home versus just grabbing early dinner!"}
{"text":"Yummy, unique food served quickly! Staff was pretty friendly too. The menu is a little hodgepodge of some breakfast foods, a good lunch selection, and a variety of desserts (which I will return to try). I had never had poutine before, but that won't be the last time. 

My only suggestion is to take it to go. The seating section isn't very comfortable or welcoming."}
{"text":"Love this little gem!! Thanks to my dad for telling me about this cute new-ish bakery in our area. We love us some ice cream, but the other goodies they offer take Salted Malted to the next level. Fresh baked cookies (OMG the CHURRO cookie), breakfast sandwich was so fresh and delicious, and I definitely can't wait to try the POUTINE and DONUTS (donut nachos, are you kidding me?!?). Great service and friendly faces, I can not wait to go back.

Kinda hope the donut machine is working. I want to eat them but they are NOT on the diet plan and I am afraid I won't be able to help myself."}
{"text":"A real cute place. I had a craving for doughnuts and found this place. It has a little bit of everything. Baked goods. Freshly made doughnuts and breakfast food."}
{"text":"A huge variety of delicious small batch cookies all day. Great shakes, and Canadian bacon everything! Not to mention poutine, which is basically the Canadian equivalent to chili cheese fries. I've been here probably a dozen or so times with the family and will keep coming as long as I live in Vegas. Could not recommend more."}
{"text":"I never thought I could love a cookie so much! The churro cookie is the best cookie I've ever tasted. Ever. I expected it to take like a churro but, the texture was also like a churro, which I was not expecting.
I sent my boyfriend to get me that cookie and he returned with a dozen cookies, cannoli's, and dole whip. We loved everything. Highly recommend checking this place out. They also have a rewards program with Perka."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a couple days ago and had to spend $30 in order to get my coupon deal. Worth it!! Everything was amazing. 

We had the breakfast sandwiches on biscuits, it was very good! Biscuits were incredibly fresh and soft. I actually really liked that it was rustic and messy. 

BEST COFFEE. We'll be coming here often just for their special coffee. Didn't need any cream or sugar it was that good.

Cookies we got:

Chocolate Chip - Best I ever had

Chipster - I was surprised that the chip was actually crispy, not my favorite cookie though.

Cookies n' cream - Amazing

Brownie Cookie - It was okay

Blue Velvet - Undetermined feelings

M&M Cookie - Soooooo good, definitely my favorite!

Churro - Seems this one has to be eaten fresh or within a day, we tried it 2 days later and was uh...just...not right. Next time we'll try it same day.

Sugar Cookie - Best sugar cookies ever!!!

We also got the pineapple mango Dole Whip and it was very good! I usually don't like chunks of fruit like that but this was different. Definitely a great option if you are a little more health conscious. 

Only con/complaint: The place needs like one more table and extra chairs.

Everyone there was so nice and helpful. We will be back very soon to try the mini donuts and their ice cream (:"}
{"text":"I have no idea how authentic it is, but the poutine and sandwiches and pastries and basically everything make me want to move to Canada. In a good way. Like to get closer to this food, not further away from it. Yeah."}
{"text":"DOLE WHIP! Amazingly delicious and perfect for a hot day. Great service and price. They also have a mango whip that, you can mix with the dole whip for a great combo."}
{"text":"Absolutely lovely hidden gem offering everything you could possible imagine when you went comfort food or a sweet treat. This is Canadian hospitality for sure!

You'll have a hard time coming in and choosing just one menu item, so be prepared to ponder your culinary adventure of the day. From fresh donuts to fries to ice cream, Salted Malted has pretty much everything.

My only complaint is a lack of seating - I wonder if a few tables outside would help this?"}
{"text":"The owner was awesome and the bakery is so good!!
We go once a week for those great cookies!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this cute little shop. Service was as amazing as the ice cream. We'll definitely be back - many, many times!!"}
{"text":"Short and sweet,,,just like this cozy lovely establishment with the owner Catie with a C!  She's from Canada with her grandmother's recipes so how can she go wrong?!  I've only been here once and was referred by a friend's chef's wife that the Cubano sandwich was OOO SOO GOOD!  I had 3! Along with the homemade fries which were tops!  I'll be going back to try and rate their breakfast sandwich selection and made on the spot donuts!  Can't wait to make this place a 5 star place of mine."}
{"text":"Love this place...!!!
Super friendly staff, delicious sweet treats.
Love the mini donuts."}
{"text":"Oh how I yearn for Salted Malted in between visits. The staff is always very polite and friendly. You can joke and laugh with them it's great! But... The cannoli! The white chocolate dipped shell make them so yummy; which also serves as barrier type of protection for the shell. The chocolate coated shell means you can buy a larger quantity and they will still be good tomorrow! The filling is heavenly. It's so smooth and creamy. Top with some pistachios and OMG yummy! 
The cookies are also amazing... I'm just saying! =)"}
{"text":"Definetly a 5 star!! If I could go 10 I would. Everything is fantastic. Fresh and assorted menu items. 
It's a local business with a small town feel and tons and tons of love poured it. They really work hard to make it all happen
Thank you for the experience!  We'll be back"}
{"text":"I have a backlog of reviews I need to write from places I've visited five months ago. Salted Malted is one of them and I'm pushing this to the top of the queue, unfortunately, because they're closing for good this weekend.

I loved their chocolate chip cookies. It's everything a great chocolate chip cookie should be -- slight crisp edges but chewy throughout, full of chocolate with a balanced amount of sweetness, hints of bitterness and a touch of salt. Cookies 'n cream was a  chocolate cookie through and through, topped with a rich frosting. Ginger molasses was covered in sugar, with a chewy molasses-rich interior. The lemon cookie had a subtle lemon flavor, topped with powdered sugar. Those who like bacon with their sweets will like the maple bacon cookie, as it's topped with it. The cookie itself is a chocolate chip variety topped with maple sauce. The carrot cake was one of my favorites. Full of bits of carrots, raisins, and nuts, it had a chewy texture with hints of spice and topped with a cream cheese frosting. The macadamia nut was firmer than other cookies, but still a good option. The Chipster, topped with bits of potato chips, had a good balance of saltiness and sweetness. The peanut butter cookies -- both the plain peanut butter and peanut butter chocolate -- were good options, too, with a modest amount of peanut butter that won't have you cleaning your gums afterwards. 

Pricing was excellent. Only $11.99 for a dozen. That's a steal for the quality of cookies they're selling. With some of the best cookies in town, they will be sorely missed."}
{"text":"Hands down the best ice cream around! Friendly cute staff, treats of all kinds and great reasonable prices! Definitely will be back for more sooner than later!! 5 STAR all the way"}
{"text":"I eat at nearby Cugino's often and when I saw a sign that Salted Malted Bakery & Creamery was opening soon I was excited to see what they had to offer. I have been by a few times since they opened so far and have had different experiences each time. I have to say that when I see the name, I think of homemade ice cream and that's not what they have here. It's Thrifty ice cream and I love that kind, but since I can get that at several nearby places around town now I had hoped for something different. They do have Dole Whip! They will take their cookies (your choice of cookie) and make a ice cream sandwich for you and they have ice cream cakes. 

I've tried several of the cookies. The price has gone up since they opened, but it's still affordable and the prices were so cheap originally that I wondered how they would stay in business. Currently the Classic Cookies are $0.75 cents each, 6 for $3.99 and 12 for $6.99 and the Specialty Cookies are $0.99 cents each, 6 for $4.99 and 12 for $8.99 with Holiday Cookies priced at $1.50 each. I was excited to try the Churro Cookie, but it didn't taste anything like a churro and was under cooked in the middle. Some of the cookies I really liked were the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, Chipster and The Heartbreaker Cookie. What I loved about the Heartbraker was that the cookie was like banana bread with chocolate chips in it and then there was a good amount of chocolate on the top with banana chips and some sort of peanut butter cream. If you like bananas and chocolate, I recommend the Heartbreaker! 

The mini donuts are made fresh to order and they have a variety of toppings. Classic Mini Donuts are 3 for $1.29, 6 for $2.29 and 12 for $4.29 and the Specialty Mini Donuts are 3 for $1.89, 6 for $3.49 and 12 for $5.99. You can get the \"Donachos\" for $7.50 which is nachos, donut style! I ended up trying 2 different flavors of the specialty donuts and wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be. I had Amaretto and Chocolate Cherry and they both just tasted like delicious plain donuts. I don't know if they forgot to shake mine in some flavor dust, but I'll try them again in the future because they were tasty and priced just right. 

Canadian Butter Bars and Tarts as well the Nanaimo Bars are $1.75 each and worth every penny. These are all sweet, so if you aren't a fan of sweet things then this isn't for you. All of these are well loved desserts in Canada, where the husband and wife owners of this place are from. The one without raisins is a take on a Sugar Pie and is easily addictive and a different take being in the form of a bar and not a tart in a pastry shell like most commonly served in Canada. The one with raisins (the owners grandmothers recipe) is equally delicious, but you must be someone who likes raisins because they do stand out. When it comes to the Nanaimo Bars they are made with a crumb type layer at the bottom then a custard like filling and topped with chocolate. They can be made in different flavors and they had coconut this last time which I liked it a lot, but I hope in the future they also make the mocha and peanut butter ones of these bars that are commonly made in Canada. 

I have had the Poutine twice now. It's $3.75 for the regular size and you get a decent portion. The fries are fresh cut to order and the pepper gravy is homemade. When I had it the first time there was a generous amount of cheese curds and good amount of gravy. I really enjoyed it! I went back last week and had ordered it this time with the addition of Peameal Bacon for $2 extra. The bacon wasn't bad, but I'd leave it off next time and they forgot to put gravy on it, so I was bummed about that. I'm sure if I were there eating they would have corrected it, but ordered it to-go and noticed it after opening the box and it just wasn't enjoyable without the pepper gravy binding everything together. 

They also have breakfast sandwiches, shakes, tea and coffee."}
{"text":"99 Cent grill cheese! Kids loved it. The Canadian Sunrise (bacon, egg, cheese on biscuit or Kaiser roll) and poutine were especially delish. 

Note: Kaiser roll was soft , but grilled slightly to give a little outer crunch. Poutine (large) was more than two of could handle."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stumbled upon the amazing cafe. What a special treat! Cait is a delight! The whole staff. The breakfast we enjoyed was delicious!! Definitely come try this tasty place"}
{"text":"I ate everything right away I didn't have time to capture many photos. I was able to use the Yelp three free mini donuts. I chose the cinnamon sugar and it was delicious and made fresh! I also ordered thrifty ice cream and yes they have chocolate malted crunch. In addition I grabbed a churro cookie and white chocolate cranberry cookie which were both really delicious! I'll definitely be back again. The service was great they were very friendly!"}
{"text":"We stopped in about thirty minutes before closing time so we didn't get a chance to try the poutine or mini donuts but the potato chip cookie, ice cream and cannoli were all tasty. 

This place greeted us with friendly faces and smiles. We were able to take our time looking things over and the employees were patient with us.

Their cannoli are dipped in white or dark chocolate and you can add pistachios to them. The filling flavor was different than an Italian bakery, but being this is a Canadian bakery I expected that. The flavors of spices like Cinnamon were more intense and I think they add cream cheese. 

I loved the cookie, a fun spin on a traditional chocolate chip with salty chips and butterscotch chips inside it tasted fresh and homemade. They have lots of other baked goodies and I will be back to try the Poutine."}
{"text":"There are so many options in this place, how can you go wrong? My personal favorite is the Pineapple Dole Whip. Its always so full of flavor and it always takes me to walking around Disney. My go-to place for sweets and treats!"}
{"text":"HOLY POUTINE BATMAN!!!!!



Got your attention? A'ight, cool! Yet again, a new sweet shop has opened up in my neck of the woods, and Salted Malted Bakery and Creamery is winning local residents over. Although they're listed as a bakery/creamery, they've got some delicious savory selections as well.

Sure, you can get mini doughnuts, cookies (That Canadian  Butter Tart tho'!) Dole Whip, Thrifty's ice cream , and Peets elsewhere, but this is where it's available under one roof, and at a really great value too! So far, we've tried about two thirds of their cookie selections which was originally planned to be shared among friends we were meeting for dinner. Anyone who knows me knows that I can't stand seeing people on the streets go hungry, so when the opportunity presented itself, we gave it to a lady who tearfully thanked us. I won't hand out money, but  when it comes to food and water, I won't hesitate. 

The owners are from Canada, so I'm assuming that their poutine is the closest thing you'll get to the real deal Hollyfield version-skin on fries, slightly crispy and soggy with a thin gravy(ask for more gravy if you need to ), and cheese curds from WisCANsin. At only $3.75 for a small, it is rich, plentiful,  and much better than The Blind Pig's version. Service here is very pleasant  from everyone here, from when you enter these doors, to when they are assembling your order, to when you leave, instead of \"Have a great day!\" It's \"See you  tomorrow!\" Service with a smile from beginning to end. 

The Canadian Sunrise breakfast sandwich  is a great way to start your day  (sandwiches are made on your choice of a homemade biscuit or kaiser roll), and their 99 cent Grilled Cheese is comfort food at it's finest! For me, the savory items are where it's at, and that Green Apple-Matcha Slush is the perfect accompaniment to any of their sammies!
Thrifty ice cream fans, go all in with the Belgian Waffle Sundae-your choice of three scoops, fudge, caramel, and whipped cream(additional toppings extra) which is definitely enough for two or three people.

There's definitely something for everyone here at Salted Malted Bakery and Creamery even though you don't have a sweet tooth ...their selections, service, and prices will keep you and your family coming back without breaking the bank!  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Poutine and a Dole Whip?! You can't go wrong with this place. The cookies were all great and they make fresh mini donuts. Loved this place. And they have board games so my kids loved it too."}
{"text":"Too sugary for me. Had ice cream and Nutella brownie. Didn't taste the Nutella at all and was more like straight sugar frosting. All too rich for me. Service was good."}
{"text":"Tasty food and baked goods reasonably priced. A quaint cafe/bakery atmosphere. Lunch menu is limited. But their baked chocolate chip cookies are out of this world! I see this establishment gaining popularity, and will probably out grow their current location."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  To be fair, I'm very critical on eateries.  The food was very good, not great, but very good.  The sweets were all great,  the ice cream was also great.  And the staff is the best part of the store. Authentically friendly with attention to detail. If you want to treat the kids this is a great place to go."}

{"text":"Awesome place! Very friendly! Loved it. Ice cream is great! Priced just perfect. The cookies are amazing"}
{"text":"Their COOKIES AND CREME cookie is to diee for!! Its prob the only reason i come here! Their dole whip is soo good too! And their little doughnuts are yummy too..they just take forever to make. I see the employees getting irritated with it lol but I would too so I'm ok with that."}
{"text":"This biggest shame is that people are blindly passing this bakery to walk into Starbucks. This bakery really does it all. Including fresh breakfast sandwiches that are delicious. They offer fresh coffee, hot chocolate and much more. And it's all amazing. Very clean and cute restaurant. Also very friendly. Prices are also very reasonable. If you're in the area for breakfast one morning don't hesitate to stop!"}
{"text":"Friendly service can happen in Vegas and Salted Malted is proof! The owner makes an effort to chat with you when you are there and is totally authentic. She was kind to my three children, one of which was being a total brat. She didn't bat an eye. Thank you for that because I was embarrassed. 

Now for the food. The poutine is great! It's French fries covered in yummy brown gravy with cheese curds. We lived in Vermont for a year and had poutine there... Since it's close to Canada and Poutine is a Canadian dish. I think this was better! 
We also had a pineapple whip, 3 fresh mini donuts (currently free with Yelp check in), two scoops of ice cream and one of almost every cookie, including two of the three bars. All were wonderful. If you have a sweet tooth this will certainly hit the spot. I recommend milk with the cookies. It's across the road from Costco. Yum!!"}
{"text":"Clean with friendly, prompt service.

We bought the poutine with bacon, butter tarts without raisins and a caramel cookie. The poutine was good. The butter tarts were just okay. They didn't have much flavor. The cookie was outstanding and the best thing we ordered. I would definitely go here again to try everything else."}
{"text":"Salted Malted Bakery & Creamery is a wonderful little gem in North Las Vegas.  I happened to be in this part of town for my son's dental appointment and randomly opened my Yelp app to browse businesses nearby with high yelp ratings.  I found Salted Malted and was anxious to try the incredible looking cookies as soon as possible.  

We were greeted as soon as we walked in and asked if we had been here before.  When I replied that we have not, the worker proceeded to educate me on the various offerings of deliciousness that they sell, cookies, ice cream, cannolis, shakes, malts, sundaes, dole whip, ice cream sandwiches that were made to order.  Donut nachos, poutine, mini donuts.  It was heaven and EVERYTHING looked amazing.  He was incredibly patient with me as it took my son and I quite some bit of time spent looking around to figure out what we were going to get and was more than happy to answer any of my questions.

We ordered three mini donuts since they were free with a Yelp check in and they were made right in front of us!  How cool is that?  We also got a 1/2 dozen regular cookies and a 1/2 dozen specialty cookies and a white chocolate cannoli.  It's not always the best idea to wander into a bakery establishment while hungry.  The flavors ordered were blue velvet, m&ms, sugar, carrot cake, maple bacon, chocolate chip, chocolate peanut butter, brownie, cookies & cream and churro.  The owner was so kind as to advise us to be sure to eat the churro cookie today or else it will taste stale since it's an airy cookie.  As if that was going to be a problem!  That baby didn't even make it home.  

All the cookies were wonderful and had a great texture, chewy soft in the middle and a slightly crisp edge.  The cannoli was amazing, freshly filled so the outside was nice and crispy with a beautiful cream center.  I wish I got more than one.  The donuts literally melted in your mouth and I'll have to get more than three next time.  

Service was awesome, everything we bought tasted amazing and the prices are so reasonable.  When I showed my husband how much we came home with vs. how much we paid for it, he couldn't believe it.  We will be back soon.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Everything we had was delicious. Customer service was on point and we had the pleasure of being assisted by Cait, one of the owners. We weren't sure about the savory items they offered but we were delighted to have her knowledgeable skill on Canadian speciality.
 
Hot items/Savory-
The Poutine was delicious and very authentic to what you would expect from Canada. The fries and Cheese Curds was balanced and the gravy was flavorful with a hint of spice. Highly recommended. We also got the Canadian Sunrise breakfast sandwich, the Canadian bacon was good and reminded me on my visits to Canada. The grilled cheese was crispy and cheesy in the right places and consistent plus at 0.99 cents you can't go wrong.

Sweets- We bought a dozen of their cookies in different flavors to take home since we were full with the hot items we had. So far we had the Churro cookie in the car ride back home and wish we got more because it was so good and would recommended it. Overall their selection of their sweets was overwhelming but will be back for more.

Overall it was a great mom/pop place that was recommended by friends and Yelp. The only thing we wish it was more closer to home."}
{"text":"Old school 50s malt diner feel.. one of very few places where the owner comes and talks to u about ur meal and has an actual convo with u.. great date place.."}
{"text":"I walked in waited behind a house mom and her 4 kids, two managers were standing around not even asking if I needed anything. I kept waiting and still after 10 mins I wasn't even asked if I needed help, sad."}
{"text":"Salted Malted is a brand new bakery & creamery located on the north side of Vegas. I came in here with a few of my friends for their soft opening to try some of their sweets, and I was not disappointed!

The interior made me feel comfortable. Everything was neat and organized, and the overall feel to the place is home-y in a way. I really dig the color scheme because it really made the place come together.

They serve dole whip here, which is cool in my opinion because not many places in the area have authentic dole whip. You can get it in the original pineapple flavor, strawberry, or swirl them together for a refreshing mix of flavors. 

I can't decide on whether I liked their mini donuts or their cookies more! The mini donuts remind me of little bite-sized funnel cakes. I tried the glazed and raspberry ones, which were pretty amazing. The glazed had the perfect amount of sweetness, and the raspberry one had a strong raspberry flavor balanced with powdered sugar on top. I can see how the mini donuts can be very addicting because these miniature confections packed some serious flavor! 

The cookies are something to rave about as well. My favorite ones out of the bunch were the Chipster and the Brownie. The Chipster (which is very cleverly named) is a cookie with caramel and chocolate chunks in the batter with a potato chip in the middle. Think \"salted caramel\" because that's what it tasted like. The Brownie probably is the best tasting cookie I've had in a while. The gooey bits of chocolate are what rocked my taste buds! If you order a bunch of cookies, make sure to add these two to your arsenal. 

Don't be afraid to go all out here. With the wide selection of sweets available, I'm sure you can find the right treat to fall in love with... I can't wait for the next time to get my dose of sweetness! This place is new, but I can definitely see a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed and we are in this lot often. I had the poutine bowl which was also my first time and I thought it was very tasty and very filling. The Canadian bacon is very tasty and the cookies were so soft and very tasty! Not much room to sit inside if it gets busier though."}
{"text":"We opted to go here for a quick breakfast before a road trip instead of McDonald's and I'm so glad we did! The breakfast sandwiches were flavorful and bread was fluffy. Definitely coming back for the thrifty ice cream and poutine!"}
{"text":"When I read my friend, Mel C.'s review, and saw Nelson & Sylvia Q. check in here, I knew I had to stop by this Hot & New Bakery/Creamery in Las Vegas!

Knowing that this shop has Canadian roots, I had to get the poutine and the Canadian Butter Bar!  Because of the season, I added on the Pumpkin Latte Cookie...

The poutine was served hot and fresh!  I've had it once in Honolulu, but it was cold and mushy at the time - I was not a fan.  However, this time, I ate it right at the cash register when it came out!  I grabbed the fries with my fingers and chomped away happily!  The shop owner rushed to get me napkins, utensils and a cup of gravy to go for me!  Please note: it's better to eat it right away with the Wisconsin cheese curds and gravy in a cup on the side.  The salt and pepper really enhanced the outside crunch of each potato fry - yum!  I gobbled up all of the cheese!  Mmm!

I had the Canadian Butter Bar later - filled with maple syrup and raisins, on a bed of buttery crust, if felt like the top slightly crisp layer was possibly brown sugar,  All together, it was so delicious!

The Pumpkin Latte Cookie was on the soft side.  It was just okay with a crunchy surprise on the top - yay!

Next time, I need to have the mini doughnuts - made fresh right in front of you in the fryer!  That means that I will be returning. ..oh, oh...  ;)  I also need some ice cream and Dole Whip (yes, I don't get Dole Whip in Hawaii. ..I live too far away. ..LOL! )

The free parking and friendly, excellent service was great! They knew that I was a First Timer from the bewildered look I displayed. They encouraged me to eat the poutine right there because it would taste better than eating it in the car, but I was late in picking up mom, auntie, & sister already. ...  Ah, sneaking away to eat is stressful!  Hahaha!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times with the family even though Salted Malted isn't technically open yet.  I think the owner referred to it as a soft opening...either way, their lights are on so we keep going back!  They've added menu items each time but we can't get enough of their gourmet cookies (cookies 'n cream, Churro, brownie cookies!?), and picked up half a dozen for less than $5 this afternoon.  

They have fresh made miniature donuts with tons of topping options, as well as great coffee.  Can't wait for the \"coming soon\" French fry bar, poutine, and breakfast sandwiches.  Be sure to check this place out, everything has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Decadent, Delicious, Divine, and close by on Decatur! they are experts at grilled cheese and sundaes! #repeatcustomers"}
{"text":"To find such a lovely delicious dessert place in this city of sin, was such a delight. I went here expecting nothing but boy Oh boy I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to Baskin Robins or basic ice cream franchises. 

They have things like donuts, cookies, milkshakes and of course ice cream. They have added different cookie flavors weekly as they change ice cream flavors weekly. They handmake their waffles and are expecting to have churro cones and donuts filled with ice cream! YEAH DONUTS FILLED WITH ICE CREAM?! WHILE ITS STILL WARM! I mean, heaven on earth? I MEAN SURE WHY NOT! 

Here's the real reason why I'm so amazed at this Bakery&Creamery, their price. A dozen mini donuts, it's what like $6 at Walmart? $4.29 here baby. Their dozen of specialty cookies that ranges from strawberry cheesecake to Maple n Bacon? $5.99. To have prices like this with such specialty and handmade things is such a rare thing to find nowadays, which is definitely noticed. 

I recommend this place to anyone and everyone just to try. Their service is very personal and comforting & the owners were so sweet and excited for their business! 

TL,DR: amazing desserts with unbeatable prices. Easily my new favorite dessert place."}
{"text":"I'll give you this... that sandwich was tasty... but at what cost ...

Cleanliness standards were abysmal. Going in at open looked like they had not cleaned at all the day before. Customer facing displays were dirty, and customer writing on the boards and windows were coming off. The doughnut window had grease all over it from the previous day and the napkin dispensers were dirty and not filled.
There were 4 lights missing or off and 8 ceiling tiles that were broken.

The cashier never washed his hands, had a dirty uniform , and delivered mediocre service at best. When asking for cream for my coffee, I was handed a dirty carafe from the front of there RTD&E display case. 

The cook in the back was absolutely the one redeeming quality about my visit. She makes a great sandwich and seemed like she was jaded to your poor decisions of hiring for the front end of your business.

I love the idea you have but you need to raise your standards of   Cleanliness and customer service. Every customer, every day, is a chance to create a life long customer. I will not advocate for this place and will not have my business again. 

Thanks for the great sandwich."}
{"text":"Really just good for Dole Whip. Their cookies used to be bigger and better. Still ok...but sort of ordinary now.

Also, can a place call itself a creamery if they don't make their own ice cream, but instead sell Thrifty's ice cream at an upcharge? Unclear."}
{"text":"It has been years since I've had peameal bacon and after being alerted by Michael U to its existence at Salted Malted, I had to make the trip to North Las Vegas to get some.  I used to stop on Hurontario Street in Mississauga on my way home from Toronto to have breakfast and get my peameal bacon fix.  Now it's fairly close by.

I came here after an appointment.  The place was empty and I went to the counter to order.  I got the Canadian Sunrise which is peameal bacon, cheddar cheese, egg over easy, and on aa biscuit.  I got coffee with the sandwich.

I sat at a table and did some photos while waiting for the sandwich.  It arrived in an appropriate amount of time and it was excellent.  The biscuit was great--very flaky and buttery and the bacon was really worth the trip.  I didn't see any plastic utensils as I hadn't moved from my table when I arrive but the biscuit was so flaky I could have used a fork to gather up the bits that broke away it was that fresh.

I saw some pastries and cookies that I need to stop by again to try.  This trip, I was on a mission for the Canadian Sunrise and it was great!"}
{"text":"The owners of this shop are an amazing couple. Their baked bars and cookies,especially the Nanaimo bar, are amazing, and a good value for under $2. I love getting the dole whip which can be refreshing and a good alternative to higher calorie options. Lastly, the $0.99 grilled cheese is a great option to feed kids on a budget and the beef on weck is a delicious choice for adults."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! Love the carrot cake cookie and the cranberry dream bar! Enjoyed my first Dole Whip and the customer service rocks. Can't wait to return although my waistline is very afraid. Ha!"}
{"text":"Finally went to Salted Malted! It's very quaint inside with a large selection of desserts. It's a great place to take your kids as one can get cookies, while another can have ice cream and another can pick out doughnuts. Ice cream was good and I also had one of the bars. I thought the prices were reasonable and the staff very nice and helpful. Definitely go here if you're craving something sweet!"}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth this place is a must! Everything is so good!! My favorite thing to get is the pineapple dole whip. It tastes so much like the one from Hawaii! Also it was my first time trying the poutine fries & I was shocked on how much I liked them! Definitely will be coming back to try other things on the menu :)"}
{"text":"What a score for dessert in the Northwest! I yelped for dessert because half of us wanted ice cream and the others wanted baked goods. We didn't even know this place existed and we were literally in the same parking lot earlier today. I had a cookie sundae which consisted of two cookies of my choice and 3 scoops of ice cream also of my choice. For cookies, I chose the salted praline and chips a lot (with actual potato chips). I picked salted caramel, praline and cream, and malted chocolate as my ice cream. I got hot fudge and caramel sauce for toppings with whipped cream. My little nephew loved his cotton candy scoop, too. The owner was there and was explaining how they used her grandmas recipes, we could tell this shop was her dream. The menu showed assorted breakfast sandwiches, lunch specialties, donuts and poutine. They have an incredible rewards program and many other things I would like to try so I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Unique, fun joint!!!! Customer service is spectacular!!!!!!! Baked cookies are great, fries with gravy are legit, too legit to quit!!!! Such an odd but fun menu. You want donuts, they got it! You want ice cream, they got it!!! You want breakfast, they got it!. Five Stars for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Allni can say is yum.   Nicest people. Amazing food.  And the baked goods????   Molasses ginger cookies and cappuccino. Perfection"}
{"text":"Ok I tried this place for the heck of it.  The Poutine is off the charts good with the Canadian bacon on it.  The cheese curds are so fresh they are still squeaky.   A large poutine with bacon is a meal all by itself.

The Cuban sandwiches are awesome.  The Canadian Sunrise sandwich is also good.  This place is more about deserts than hot food.  Inside it looks like an ice cream shop.  They make the mini-donuts fresh.  The maple flavored blondies are so good I bought an extra one to go.  The cookies are not your average cookies they have interesting ones although I did not try them.   Strangely they also have Dole Whip like in Hawaii.  The day I went they had Mango and Pineapple.

We'll go back.  Two thumbs up just for the Canadian bacon which is not like any other I have ever had."}
{"text":"Salted Malted Bakery and Creamery,
          Do you know what you just did to me?  Do you really know?  Well, you got me to write a review on Yelp.  I vowed to myself that I would not write another review this year, but I couldn't resist after my third visit at your establishment.  

First things first, you had me at peanut butter.  No wait!  You had me at carrot cake.  Okay, I'm not going to lie.  You had me at mini-donuts?  Perhaps it was because you have ice cream cookie sandwiches with Thrifty Ice Cream? Maybe it was the poutine? Or, is it the great service that you give everyone that enters your business?  I guess it really doesn't matter how you got me.  You got me and got me good.  In my opinion, you have some to the best cookies in town that come with the best prices in town. Less than a dollar for one of your creative and tasty cookies?  Are you kidding me?  How do I even stop at just one?  That's right Yelpers, Salted Malted gets 5 stars from me.  

Cookies That I've Tried (currently priced at $.80 each, sized at about 3 inches)
-Peanut Butter
-Peanut Butter Chip
-The Heartbreaker (Banana, Peanut Butter, and Chocolate Chip)
-Blue Velvet
-Pumpkin Latte
-Bacon Maple
-Strawberry Cheesecake
-Brownie

My favorite is definitely your Peanut Butter with your Carrot Cake and Peanut Butter Chip tied at 2nd.  All your cookies are good, always fresh, and very photogenic.  I love how you guys always ensure that we have a fresh \"right out of the oven\" cookie when we arrive. 

Mini-Donuts (currently priced at $4.29 for a dozen Classic or $5.99 for a dozen Specialty)
-Classic (plain, sugar, glazed, and cinnamon)
-Specialty (Matcha Green Tea and Fruit Loops)

I have tried them all except your 18 mini-donut Do'Nachos.  All are very good, but I am boring and still prefer your Classic \"nothing on it\" mini-donut. I admit, I love Trish's infamous Mini-Donuts in San Francisco.  Trust me, your mini-donuts rank up there with them. 

Regardless, how you got me. You got me.  I will definitely be back for your PB cookie and mini-donuts. I also look forward to trying your grilled cheese and ice cream cookie sandwiches. I'm sure glad you're on my side of town.  

PS Yelpers...
Salted Malted Bakery & Creamery also serves Peet's Coffee, sandwiches, and based on some of their Yelp photos, they even build creative cakes. 

PS Gym-Goers...
Salted Malted Bakery & Creamery is a great stop for your post workout insulin spike.  Take advantage of an intense workout with one of their cookies and a half dozen mini-donuts.  Yeah Buddy!!"}
{"text":"The cookie ice cream sandwich was amazing and the dole whip is hard to find around Vegas.  The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.    The mini donuts  were sinful.   What is not to like."}
{"text":"Perhaps you already sold it to a customer. I have absolutely no reason to make things up and I don't appreciate your response. Learn how to take some accountability/responsibility for your business sake."}
{"text":"Such great food and prices and everyone who works there are just fantastic! I love going back and trying their new cookies! Must have!"}
{"text":"I can't begin to tell you how incredible this place is! The owner is such a sweetheart, and the employees are so nice. Be sure to try the dole whip when you go! :))"}
{"text":"Stellar customer service and great food! Homemade everything including baked goods and ice cream! AND they have poutine fries...what more can I say!"}
{"text":"With a name like Salted Malted Bakery Creamery you know that yummy stuff awaits you. I believe its still their soft opening period so not everything on their menu is offered just yet. They have yummy awesome cookies for reasonable prices. Prices nowadays for cookies easily runs you $2.00 a cookie to its so refreshing to see cookies for under $1.00. Its actually $7.99 for a gourmet dozen. I love soft chewy cookies with unique flavors & the cookies at Salted Malted delivers just that. The strawberry shortcake, churro, cream cheese carrot, brownie, cookies n cream, oatmeal raisin, & potato chipper were all yummy!!! Cookie Monster would faint!!! I would like to see a lemon flavor cookie as well as a smores cookie. The Matcha Green Apple Slushy is refreshingly different with a nice green tea punch to your taste buds at the end of each sip. Looking forward to trying items not available yet on the menu like the Poutin Fries. Staff were friendly & you can sample the dole whips & slushes as well. I took a star off for the Thrifty's Ice Cream sold. When I read Salted Malted CREAMERY I was so excited because I thought that a place that calls themselves a creamery must make their own ice cream. So I was a little bummed to find out that they sold Thrifty's ice cream. I don't think Thrifty's Ice Cream is all that great & its also filled with alot of added persevatives. Sadly, we don't have many Creamery's in Las Vegas that actually make homemade ice cream. Which is weird cause its so hot here. Anyways, the cookies will continue to bring me back. I suggest to all Cookie Monsters out there to make your trek down to Salted Malted Bakery  Creamery. Say Salted Malted 10 times very fast...."}
{"text":"I have one word YUMMY!!! I have a sweet tooth so when I saw an advertisement for it I knew I had to try it. At first I had a little trouble finding it but maybe I'm just blind so I actually had to call to get direction. The gentlemen who answered the phone was super nice and helped me find it. It's right next to the Geisha House FYI and its on the north side of the shopping plaza. There are a couple trees that kinda block your view from seeing the sign if you are down on the other side of the parking lot. 

First impressions. When I walked in it smelled amazing! Sweet and savory hit my senses all at once. I love the Canadian themed food.  I was greeted immediately by the husband and wife who own it. I had a lovely conversation with them and they made my experience a great one. Maybe I just have a talkative personality but I love chatting with the owners of mom and pop businesses. 

I decided to get some desserts on this first visit but really contemplated getting a sandwich and those amazing looking poutine fries to go as well. That will be next time! I ordered a maple bacon cookie( probably my favorite), cashew cookie(amazing), churro cookie( my least favorite but had an interesting texture), oatmeal white chocolate chip cranberry cookie(delicious) and then I also got two cannoli( chocolate chip and pistachio).  I was pretty impressed that they fill the cannoli fresh when you order. I have to say the pistachio cannoli was my favorite.  Omg and they also have Dole whip!!! Definitely try it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"So freaking good. 
I'll risk having diaaabeeetus. (Diabetes) 
But yes I got one of each cookie and some ice cream and I had to stop myself from devouring everything so I can share it with my toddler lol"}
{"text":"Want fresh carnival style donuts come here.


Want custom ice cream
Sandwhiches with every kind of cookie your heart could ever possibly desire.. 

Come here..

They have thrifty Ice cream which you can pretty much get any where.

I wish they made their own that would be bitchin but I'm sure it's too expensive maybe down the road they'll do something along those lines... 


The owner is wonderful  and super nice!

Very clean and always smells good!

Sometimes crowed sometimes not. Just depends. 

Poutine does take a minute so be patient!:)"}
{"text":"Great little place. We stopped by for cookies and mini doughnuts for a gathering of friends. Staff was super friendly and patient as we decided on what to get. The doughnuts were awesome. We got pretty much one of every cookie too. Great prices and great goodies."}
{"text":"We loved everything about this place! Well first off,  they had us at Dole whips. My family absolutely loves Dole whips and when we walked in and  saw they also had mango Dole whips it made husband jump for joy! We then proceeded to get every dessert cookie they had to go, except I couldn't wait to try them. The chipster cookie was incredible I had to go get another one so my husband wouldn't fight with me. The red velvet and churro cookies were great as well. We stayed and talked with the owners who were so sweet and kind. The atmosphere was really cool, they had games set out so my kids played while we fought over cookies. We will definitely be back... Maybe tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This place is freakin sweet! Poutine is awesome and they even give you the gravy in a separate cup if you are taking it to go so the fries don't get soggy on the drive home. You need to get the peameal bacon on top too, really adds to the dish. Much cheaper than the other couple places that offer poutine in town, and you get a bigger portion here too. The sandwiches are also great, peameal bacon egg and cheese is so good. I have tried quite a few of the bakery sweets and they are really tasty. I almost forgot, the Nanaimo Bars are perfect, almost as good as mine!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The owner is super nice as are the employees.  The Dole fruit whip was excellent.  The desserts look delicious (I couldn't eat the cakes due to my allergy).  We will come here again."}
{"text":"Super awesome place! Clean, friendly staff, fantastic coffee, the Canadian bacon is made there and it is die for!"}
{"text":"NICE place - I have a friend who is lactose intolerant, so we chatted about the Dole Whip...nice option. 
Poutine!  they have poutine and will most certainly order this next time. Eh!  (Canadian imports own the place).."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Not only is it delicious, but it is an incredible value by today's prices.  They have homemade cookies, mini donuts, sundaes, ice cream cookie sandwiches, ice cream cones, etc. There are lots of choices and it is a very friendly place.  The cookie ice cream sandwich an incredible value and they let you have two different cookies if you want. This is our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Look if you want some good food get your butt in here. Smaller menu but they nailed it. Great price for some classic foods done right. They also have poutine for you Canadians. 

The bakery items here are fantastic to do after you get your fill of all the savory items on the menu you can indulge yourself with the sweet."}
{"text":"After waiting 15 minutes for two employees to try to figure out how to make a latte, we finally ended up with cups of grounds and NO apology. Will never return.
In response to the fact we received $10 back...that included the tip in cash I paid prior to receiving our coffees. Your reaction of \"calm down, calm down\" was not appropriate."}
{"text":"Simply unbelievable. I walked in and it smelled like how I remember my grandmas kitchen smelling (Which is a wonderful thing btw!). Fresh baked cookies on display, dole whip, AND Thrifty brand ice cream!! I actually was in the neighborhood and wanted to surprise my sweetheart with a couple of fresh baked cookies but I also had to treat myself to a pineapple dole whip. A small cup is only 2 bucks!! And it's a good size small to boot! Although this little gem is nowhere near my home I will definitely be making the drive back for some more goodies. Also I have to add that the man that rung me up was very friendly as was the other girl behind the counter. Great concept, tasty treats, and prices so reasonable! You guys have to stop in and give it a \"whip\"!! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Have been here before, usually great place and products. 

The problem was they were out of a lot of things. Everyone there before us and after us ordered something they were out of. They ran out of certain cookies (people decided to wait 20 minutes for more), they were out of hot fudge, they were out of Dole Whip. By the time my sundae was ready (I think they ran out of donut mix), my family were already done with their desserts.
 
This business seems to be somewhat successful, but they aren't reinvesting in it. There was only 3 kids working there. Doing a great job, but overwhelmed. The owners need to hire an adult manager if they will not be there regularly."}
{"text":"Holy sweet, goodness!!! Salted Malted blows any ice cream/yogurt place out of the water.  I'm sure it was the owners,  but they were so welcoming. A man offered me a sample of a pumpkin bar,  and it was scrumptious. I ended up getting that ala mode style, my boyfriend got cinnamon sugar donuts,  and we had to try some of the cookies.  We got sugar,  m&m, and oatmeal raisin. And to top of being fatties, my boyfriend got some dole pineapple soft serve. All of that under 12 bucks! What a deal and it was all very very good. I know this will be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had just finished all you can eat sushi, but we really needed our sweet fix for dessert. So, as usual, I pulled out Yelp and looked up nearby options. This place had been on my to-do list, but I'm never in this part of town. Seeing it was only a 1.5 miles away, I knew it was finally time!

We walked in about twenty minutes before closing and they had just turned off the frier for the mini donuts. So the friendly girl at the counter offered me the last four as a sample - I had the option of powdered sugar or cinnamon sugar and went with the latter. These donuts are everything I want a donut to be! Fresh from the frier, light and fluffy and simply sweetened. I would come back here for these donuts alone!

But luckily, this place has a few more treats that make it worth the drive. First, Nanaimo Bars. What's a Nanaimo Bar? Well, I didn't know either until about six months ago when I visited Vancouver and saw them everywhere. It has a chocolate mixed nuts crust, a thick cream layer (it almost tastes as sweet as a butter cream icing!) and is topped with a rich chocolate ganache. I was so happy to find this delicious treat outside of Canada and right here in my city!

Second, a Cookie with chocolate chips, butterscotch chips and potato chips. While I must admit that I didn't really taste the potato chips at all, it was still an amazing cookie! Make sure you ask to have it warmed, because that's how it's meant to be! It's chewy on the outside and gooey on the inside. 

The owner came out and talked with us while we nibbled on our loot. She was very friendly. Since they were closing, she offered us a churro cookie as they wouldn't be fresh for the next day and would otherwise be thrown away. We already had so many treats in front of us that this was one we gladly took home for later. 

My hubby also tried some kind of cranberry cake bar and he absolutely loved it!

This place is quite a deal and has super-legit goodies! Yelp check-in gets you three free donuts, my receipt gave me a coupon for my next visit and every day of the week offers a different deal. We were there on a Wednesday, the day you get a free dog treat with any purchase!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. So disappointed. The place is not clean and very outdated. But I was there for the ice cream. Well that was the worst disappointment. Flavorless and icy. My husband got a milkshake. I got an scoop in a homemade cone. The girl behind the counter didn't use gloves or wash her hands as she grabbed an ice cream cone and handed it to me.... But that's just my own erk. The cones also just sit out on the counter on top of a random machine. My husband even commented on how the ice cream didn't taste very good. And we really aren't ice cream snobs. Not sure what the rave is for this place but I won't be back. Glad I tried it before taking people from out of town here."}
{"text":"We just love this little gem !! ESP on Sunday morning before we go to Costco !! Everything is great here !! We love the breakfast sandwiches and the cookies are to die for !!! Being from Michigan with Canada right next door , it's like bring home !!!Keep your stick on the ice !!!"}
{"text":"#17 of 2017

In search of a sweet treat?  Or maybe some poutine?  Look no further but Salted Malted Bakery & Creamery (SMBC).  That is a mouthful!

I found this place on yelp, and it was close by one of the shopping centers we were at doing our craft store haul.  Side note: HI needs better crafts stores.  LV has Michaels, Hobby Lobby, AND Joanne? Not fair!

All that crafting worked up an appetite so we stopped here and ordered a few cookies, a shake, and a butter tart.  There are so many treats to eat here that it is kind of a potpurri of yumminess.  The cookies were soft and delectable, and the shake was rich and decadent.  Didn't get my SIL's opinion on the tart, but that looked good too!  Make sure you check in for three mini donuts made to order.  They are like little funnel cake donuts, to-go!  :)"}
{"text":"First time here and very impressed with the Excellent and Friendly service!   It was our sons birthday  went to dinner and he suggested we come here for dessert and who can go to a Canadian restaurant without ordering Poutine with bacon... first time I've had it and now I understand why our neighbors to the North love this stuff!!  I had an ice cream sandwich with delicious peanut butter and chocolate cookie and a M&M cookie and Pecan Pralines ice cream...WOW it was yummy... fresh baked cookies make that an ice cream sandwich to remember!   My hubby had an ice cream sundae with maple and bacon cookie wow it was delicious!  Birthday boy had Carrot Cake cookie, daughter-in-law had mint chocolate ice cream on a cake cone!   Best of all THRIFTY ice cream!!!  It was our first time so got to sample the pineapple/mango swirl Dole Whip.... Just like the ones you get at Disneyland!!! I will be back for a Dole whip and breakfast!   LOVELY place and so glad we found it!!"}
{"text":"Had the classic grilled cheese with Canadian bacon. YUM!!! Cute little place. Plenty of sweets to curve that sweet tooth. Place was clean.. super friendly staff. :)"}
{"text":"Place is clean and smells so yummy when you walk in. All the staff are super friendly and cheery. The Maple Bacon cookies are scrumptious!! I'm looking forward to the the cheese curds with gravy in the near future and on my next visit I plan to try some of their mini donuts."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places to go. The food is delicious, inexpensive and unique. The poutine is amazing and even the plain fries are some of the best I've ever had. Nothing beats the blue velvet cookies(except maybe a half dozen of their other flavors). Also the friendliest staff I've ever encountered. Both my kids love the place! My only complaint is that I can't give more than five stars. Check it out, you will not be disappointed. I'm sure you will fall in love with this place as my family has done!"}
{"text":"Don't tell anyone but I have a big problem, I'm lactose intolerant. It's an issue at office party's, some resturants and most of all dessert places. I try not to complian or make a big deal, don't want to be that whinny guy who complains about everyone else having fun while I have to stand on the sidelines.

This place has us lactose intolerant people covered. Dole whip is hard to find but it's so good. Fresh cookies are great with or without ice cream."}
{"text":"Super friendly employees. Everything is made the way you want it. I had a salted caramel malt with extra malt - no problem, a cannoli - 3 different types of shell and you can choose chocolate chips or pistachios to cover it, and some mini-donuts - THREE types of sugar you can choose to top the donuts! Seriously the owners know what they're doing when it comes to service. And YES, it was all delicious!
They have regular food as well; breakfast sandwiches, fries and some kind of cheese curd thing with gravy that I didn't try but sounded interesting. 
HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and it was a fantastic experience!  We met the owner who was extremely friendly and helpful.  The smell of baking snicker doodles was to die for!!!!  The food was delicious and they aren't kidding when they say they have the best grilled cheese in town!  Everything was priced exceptionally well.  Stumbling across this place was definitely a treat!  We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful. Cookies were delish and the gravy fries were really good too"}
{"text":"Tried maple bacon, pumpkin cheesecake, churro cookies and a few types of ice creams. We also had three mini donuts. Everything was very good and tasted homemade. Can't wait to go back and try the sandwiches."}
{"text":"So omg back again...2nd time this week. They have lucky charms marshmallows....with out the cereal! Oh yes! Oh and dis i mention the hazelnut creme soda! 
The staff again were all great...everyone seems HAPPY to be at work...and  on a saturday night! Happy staff happy customers... clean restraunt equalls not sick customerss! its so clean..organized,festive and has the BEST VIBR"}
{"text":"Cookies were delish.  Thrifty ice cream and use to make ice cream sandwiches.  Pretty good but mini donut machine was down."}
{"text":"This is one of the few times I can say I am truly bummed I missed a food place being open. I stopped in today and they were just getting ready to close up shop. The owners were very kind and I hope that they stay in Las Vegas to relocate. If not I wish them success and happiness in whatever there future brings!"}
{"text":"The bakery has some amazing cookies and the dole whips are so good. I tried poutine for the first time there and the owner really knows how to make it well. Love this place."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese + black cherry ice cream is my go-to. They also have perka, which gives me points to earn coupons on my next visit. I go once or twice a week with my friends :D"}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Dole Whips were amazing! And the little tiny mini donuts were tasty. Now patiently waiting for the Cuban sandwich. Yum! Yum! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We went in for the first time and were greeted by the staff. The place smelled great, and couldn't wait to start munching on the their desserts. I ordered the vanilla ice cream, double scope with a regular waffle cone. I was excited when I got the ice cream and took a bite. The first bite was good, and I continued to bite into the mound of ice cream. I ate one scoop of the ice cream and continued the second. I bit into ice crystals-the kind you have when the ice cream has been open too long in the freezer. Well, I ate it anyway. When I came to munch on my the waffle cone, it was stale, soggy, and didn't taste good. My stomach was upset after for a few hours, but, then again, I'm lactose intolerant. 

Even though I had a bad experience the first time, I would like to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp while looking for a coffee place that wasn't Starbucks. It was a great f'ing! The service was great and the food was excellent!! They have homemade Canadian Bacon and real Poutine. We also brought home some mini-donuts and a few baked goods. Everything was excellent and we will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place to eat. Sadly it's 12 miles away from my house but totally worth the drive. The cookies are amazing, the breakfast sandwiches were delicious, poutine was sooo good and they have magical dole whip. 

I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"If you're a sucker for amazing customer service, then this is the place for you. The owner is an extremely friendly Canuck (go figure) that treated our party of 7 very nicely. I had the cubano and poutine. Both were very very good, easy to reccomend. We also had some mini doughnuts and cookies which were also very tasty. My only complaint is that I have not come here sooner."}
{"text":"Poutine and ice cream!  Savory and sweet treats for those not on a diet.  Quite out of the way compared to typical Vegas tourist standards but then some of the best gems are located far from Downtown and the Strip."}
{"text":"Oh Canada it was good!!  Very friend and fun place!! I highly recommend, for Canadians, and others too!!"}
{"text":"This is a great friendly little neighborhood bakery if you're in the mood for a sweet treat or a specialty sandwich. They've become one of our favorite spots for their mini-donuts and the creative ways they serve them. They also have some hard to find ice cream flavors that are delicious! My husband can't get enough of the Chocolate Malted Crunch. Their cookies are delicious and their breakfast sandwiches are amazing. We haven't been disappointed once and we've been several times."}
{"text":"OMG this place is unbelievable. The drive was so worth it (40 minutes) the owner was sooooo friendly. I'm hoping they open more locations because I would literally come here everyday. My favorite is the churro cookie, the Oreo cookie, the maple bacon cookie, and peanut butter cookie.

My boyfriend also told me they have poutine which I am definitely coming back for. This place is all the hype for sure. I am super picky when it comes to sweets and trendy places. The prices are reasonable, and the food is of the highest and gourmet quality. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"\"I'll give you a nickel for that cookie with the potato chip sticking out of it\" says seat 3 holding up a $5 chip.

\"Ship me one too\" says seat 5, tossing a nickel at me.

Poker table commerce.  Honestly, I'd pay $5 for one of these cookies.

The cookies, outstanding. From a delicate cinnamon flavored churro to a soft, dense, chewy ginger carrot cake, and a crisp white chocolate macadamia tasting as fresh as those made in Hilo Hawaii just sinful good eats.  Pronounced intense flavors and controlled sweetness.

The fresh-baked cinnamon buns (Sunday only) with maple syrup glaze smell and taste so warm and comforting on and autumns morning...what am I saying, they are so darn good.  Who doesn't love generous swirls of cinnamon and sugar in freshly baked bread topped with gooey maple syrup?

Of course, man does not live on sweets alone and at a place claiming to be Canadian one cannot skip the iconic Quebec stable, the poutine.  Well cooked, somewhat crispy, hand cut fries top with Wisconsin cheese curds, and what tastes like the authentic chicken/beef gravy is stick to the ribs good.  Add a generous portion of their house made Canadian bacon and life is good.

Finally, try a breakfast sandwich on freshly baked, flaky biscuit.  The Canadian sunrise (house made Canadian bacon, fried egg and cheese) is as good as it sounds. For something more substantial, the Canuk (loads of Canadian bacon on a fresh-baked soft roll).  Notice the trend? Anything containing the very well-made Canadian bacon is worth trying.  Not fatty, not too salty, not overly cured.

Great service provided by the friendly owners.

Up  north and a long drive from the Strip but worth it. It would make a great snack before hitting the slopes or the poker tables."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Everytime I come here, the staff members are so friendly! There are so many options of desserts to choose from. Their milkshakes are priceless. I love being able to add cookies to it. I love Salted Malted. Will definitely come back to this place!!"}
{"text":"I had heard so many good things about this bakery, and I was so excited to find out how it was close to my house! Located in the Walmart shopping center near N. Decatur and the 215, this cute little shop has delicious goodies ranging from salty to sweet. My S.O. and I arrived Sunday afternoon and had an assortment of specialties on their menu. There were over 15 different types of cookies. The cookies were crispy on the outside and ooey gooey on the inside. Absolutely delicious with many fun flavors! My favorite so far has to be the blue velvet. We also got the Canadian sunrise breakfast sandwich, which was very tasty. We loved that it came on a homemade biscuit - except it did seem to fall a part easily, so I wouldn't recommend this for eating and driving (if you do that sort do thing !) We also had to have their poutine (a traditional Canadian dish - fries, topped with gravy and cheese curds, and optional bacon.) After trying poutine once before in Vancouver, Canada, I was pleased to find it again so close to home! Aside from their delicious food, the customer service was exceptional. The staff was so friendly and helpful, and we will definitely be back to support this local business!"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe we didn't know this place existed until recently!  They not only have breakfast and lunch sandwiches, but their \"Creme Della Creme\" is their sweets!   It's too much to write about, so you'll have to see ma pics and try it for yourself.  

Trust me... you'll need to try it for yourself.  

However, I will say that their Dole Pineapple whip is the closest we've found to the actual Dole Pineapple whip we enjoy in Hawaii.  I tried selling it to the wife that now we won't have to travel to Hawaii anymore to enjoy a taste of paradise... but she wasn't buying it."}
{"text":"We love this place and we go at least once a week. They have a great variety of cookies and desserts. My fav is their chocolate chip cookie. Cooked a little under done so it's nice and gooey. We've had all of their sandwiches and they were all good, but my fav is the Cuban. Their biscuits are fluffy and delish too. We ordered their ice cream cakes for birthdays and other celebrations and they are fantastic. Everyone is always so friendly and we really love it. I've bought cookies for friends and neighbors and they think they are scrumptious. So glad we went and checked them out!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group. The ice cream here is okay, it's very generic. My friend got a shake that was too think. She had to ask the guy to add more milk and blend it again. The cake pop I got was not very good. I didn't try enough things but the creamery seems ordinary."}

Recently opened in North Las Vegas by a husband and wife team straight out of Ontario Canada, Salted Malted Bakery & Creamery is the sort of place that immediately spoke to the hockey loving Northwest Ohio days of my youth and with a menu running the gamut from locally cured peameal bacon and traditional poutine to dozens of cookies, bars, and fried-to-order donuts a visit on Saturday proved love at first sight...and taste after taste after taste.

Small in size and clearly built-out on a budget inside a stipmall adjacent the Walmart Supercenter across the lot, entrance to Salted Malted presents patrons with a warm atmosphere of whimsical Canadiana and as toys of the Molson Guys sit near condiments including pure Maple Syrup alongside Log Cabin the service, too, speaks of our neighbors to the North - easily some of the friendliest in town.

Far less limited in its breadth of options than in size of the short and narrow space, Salted Malted lives up to its name by offering items both sweet and savory and open daily at 7:30 with items made-as-needed to replenish supplies the possibilities for customization are seemingly endless, one twenty-something witnessed eating a Belgian Waffle topped with Thrifty Ice Cream, Strawberries, and Sprinkles while his mother noshed on a makeshift Cuban Sandwich on a Kaiser Roll with Mustard, Pickle, and Maple sweetened Bacon that more than once elicited a \"this is soooo good.\"

No short distance from home, a forty-five minute roundtrip from Summerlin, it was with a large order that an appraisal of the small shop's goods would take place, and happy to answer questions despite a steady stream of traffic it was eventually in seventeen items that just under $21 was invested, the price almost too good to be true considering the craftsmanship, first bites of a clever premade \"donut ball\" proving a bit difficult with plastic utensils, but tasty and even better than the sum of its parts when allowed to warm up.

Delaying further dessert until a made-to-order sandwich and fresh cut fries beneath authentic pepper gravy and squeaky curds were presented to the table, it was on a more \"American\" biscuit that I opted to enjoy a Canadian Sunrise and far outperforming traditional four buck breakfasts the pile of peameal, cheddar, and overeasy egg was as good as anything recalled from anyplace in Toronto, including the stalls of the St. Lawrence Market while the poutine was a no frills classic, exactly like \"La Classique\" being served at Montreal's La Banquise.

Obviously not leaving without a few more sweets, some consumed on site while others were taken for the road, suffice it to say that options trend far beyond the typical Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal Cookies, none of the fourteen selected anything less than delicious with both the golden raisin freckled Butter Tart and rich Nanaimo Bar reminiscent of trips across the border while the muffin-top-like carrot cake and peanut butter with banana Heartbreaker were fluffy rounds of baked goodness, the salt tinged Chipster an equally worthy investment as were the chewy brownie and cream cheese frosted Blue Velvet.

***** Flawed only in offering an inferior product like Thrifty, the ice creams simply not on par with many throughout town, Salted Malted Bakery & Creamery brings true Canadian heritage to North Las Vegas, a destination sort of spot for expatriots as well as snowbirds, but equally welcoming to those unfamiliar or those who simply love to see someone following their heart and doing what they love."}
{"text":"Amazing service and food! Everyone is so friendly and nice.   Love this place! It was the best discovery in our area. We have had coffee, donuts and the fries! We love everything!  Next time we will have to get ice cream or the Dole Whip!  I highly recommend the Salted Malted. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"We ordered Dole Whip and Donachos..DELISH!! Great customer service and great desserts! Will deff come back!"}
{"text":"SOOOOOOO GOOD! Words can't even begin to express how happy I am that Salted Malted is just up the street from where I live. I have the biggest sweet tooth and being this close to such an amazing bakery is perfect (and also dangerous lol) for me! The guys behind the counter were super helpful, explaining what kind of cookies they and which were popular. 

I ordered a dozen (a mix of classic and specialty) cookies. The ones that I highly recommend are the Churro cookies (of course), the lemon cookie, and the cran-nut(I think it was called). But try them all! That's my goal! :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is awesome. The vegetarian poutine is ridiculously good and I can never seem to leave here without a Churro cookie!"}
{"text":"Love the food and people!! So happy it's in my backyard. The best grilled cheese sandwiches and famous dole whip like they have at Disneyland. I was born and raised in Los Angeles so going to the park was something we did often, and this took me back to my childhood.. Not to mention the malted shakes. This lovely bakery is a jewel in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. They have different kinds of treats from Canada. The girl there went over all the different treats with us and helped us pick our yummy treats!!!"}
{"text":"Homemade cookies are so delicious! Their chocolate chip cookies are moist and soft which I love. I can't stand a crunchy and dry cookie. I mainly go for their cookies & cream cookies! They're delicious! They tend to run out of their specialty cookies by the end of the night so don't expect them to be fully stocked with everything at 8:00pm. But that's understandable! They have a nice staff who attend to you promptly. They usually are busy, if you walk in and it's empty, chances are within 5 more minutes 10 people will walk in after you."}
{"text":"Fantastic is the only word to describe this place. They offer fresh homemade cookies, ice cream and offer a great variety of classics as well as specialty treats. 
A few things stick out for me seeing I'm from Buffalo NY and have spent most of my teenage and drinking days in Ontario Canada. Those would be the authentic poutine and the classic Beef on Weck. Make sure to grab both and do yourself a favor and add the Canadian bacon on the poutine and get the beef of Weck wet.. So so good. 
They also offer homemade donut holes , have Peets Coffee, and have a Disney favorite which is Dole Whip. There are so many choices to make .. Your gonna need to come back for seconds and thirds. 
The owners show a great deal of respect not only for food they serve but the respect they give customers. They make you feel welcome and whether you are a local born and raised or someone like me who is from out of state.. Come check this place out and try something new"}
{"text":"They did a great job on a cake for my sons birthday, and made me a delicious breakfast sandwhich while we talked about it. I'm not much of a cake person, but it was \"hit your mom in the face with a shovel\" good. Not the cheapest place in town, but the quality is outstanding. The owner is friendly, as well."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Owner is fun and incredible nice. The food is absolutely amazing. I will be comeing back more and more. 
The poutine is the best thing ever."}
{"text":"The owner helped me design a custom ice cream sandwich with one brownie and one chocolate chip cookie, praline pecan ice cream and crushed butterfingers to dip it in. I've been thinking about how good it was for a week!!!

Not only was the food delicious and the service fantastic, the prices were ridiculously low. At some point they will have to either raise their prices or go out of business. In the mean time go!! You'll be glad you did!!!"}
{"text":"My children enjoyed the ice cream, but I wasn't feeling the baked goods. I first ordered a custard thing with a layer of chocolate on top. I took one bite and threw it in the trash. The chocolate tasted of poor quality. It was like taking a cheap bar of baking chocolate and eating it. Yuck! I then ordered the churro cookie. Uneventful is the word I use to describe it. It's soft, not the texture of a cookie. Also, it lacked in the flavor department. It was edible. The staff is great. I had high hopes for this place. I'm actually quite surprised how high this place is rated. If you are looking for a delicious pastry head to Chocolate and Spice on W. Sahara, Patisserie Manon on W. Charleston, or Popularity for the best popcorn in the Valley."}
{"text":"Poutine, sweets, Thrifty Ice Cream, everything is great.
Just go already, you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Stopped in today to grab a bag of goodies after a late lunch. The staff was super friendly and I ended up getting an Elvis, maple tart, blue velvet cookie, bacon cookie. The cookies were a bit undercooked and we're just barely cooked batter in the middle. The maple tart was amazing and would come back for that. I wouldn't repeat the cookies again though."}
{"text":"Run over here if you live in North Las Vegas! Probably the only legit dessert place up here...but I think even if this was closer to the city it would stand its own ground.  This is similar to sweet addictions in Vegas but with many more options and classier looking. They have a variety of very creative cookies including churro cookie, bacon maple cookie, strawberry cheesecake, pumpkin brittle, and of course the classics like white chocolate macadamia nut.  You have the option of making ice cream sandwiches (Thrifty brand ice cream). They also have dole whip, malt and shakes, ice cream sundaes,mini donuts.  They also serve Peet's coffee as well.  They plan on adding a breakfast menu in the near future as well.   This will probably be our go to spot after dinner. The bacon maple cookie really hit the spot and I even got a little sample of the mini donut hot out of the fryer :)"}
{"text":"Are you looking for some baked treats or ice cream? Do want a sandwich before you have dessert? Well then you must visit! I sampled a little of everything. I had their American sunrise sandwich (sausage, egg, cheese, kaiser roll). It was tasty and cooked how I like. I enjoyed the mint malt. We also ordered their hand crafted sodas. I had raspberry and my girlfriend had blueberry. The flavors were spot on. The main reason I was excited to go was because this is Canadian themed which meant they have poutine! Poutine is fries with gravy and cheese! You must at least have it once. Unless you plan on going to Canada. Don't forget to check in for some free mini donuts! If you're in a rush get it to go. Oh Canada, how tasty your poutine is!"}
{"text":"As soon as I found a bakery of such in our vicinity, I HAD to try it ASAP. We are always in this area anyway so what the hey. This bakery opened up where the filipino bakery/restaurant, Goldilocks, once occupied. 

Walking in we were greeted with such a welcome that as each guest entering after us...I started to feel like it was an effort of trying too hard. The husband had an eye appointment nearby so I decided to take the kids inside because it wouldn't be too long until he would be finish. Of course, you can't promise kids an after school treat, have them sit in there, and expect them to be quiet. So we went ahead and ordered without the husband (just wanted to get ahead of him...make sure we approve before he joins us. Lol). 

I ordered the blue velvet cookie, between my boys there was an order of the strawberry dole whip (almost like a soft serve expect this is dairy/lactose free)...that is a huge plus to offer because a couple of my kids have a dairy allergy, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and a churro cookie--yeah a churro cookie!

Honestly, the blue velvet cookie isn't anything spectacular other than it simply is a blue velvet cookie. I probably wouldn't order it again because there are alot more other cookie choices that looked even more exciting. I just went with the blue cookie out of a last minute order for myself as I was trying to mandate the chaos my toddler was bringing on top of a fussy baby. 

The churro cookie is literally what you could.imagine, or at least how I imagined. I seen others review of it but completely forgot about it until my eldest asked if he could add a churro cookie to go with his vanilla ice cream. He was on to something--sure thing, son! Churro cookie...you got it! That's definitely a cookie worth trying.

They make these cute tiny donuts where they fry it infront of you. You turn it into your own \"nachos\". Donuts with your choice of sauce, toppings, etc...I'll have to try those on the next shot when I feel like having something sweet. I swear this has got to be the most sweets I've had in a 3 day span. They do ice cream sandwiches, waffle ice cream sandwiches, malts and shakes, and more!

Anyhow, husband's appointment took ridiculously longer than necessary and expected. So we ended up finishing all our treats and just sitting around as customer after customer after customer after customer were entering then exiting. Safe to say...they got a pretty good business flow. We were in there for a good hour waiting and waiting. 

Alas, the husband arrives. I immediately get him to look at the cookie options. It smelled of cookies. There was a constant baking of cookies which is a good thing! Means you are always eating them to its freshest. I saved the best for last because I wanted to indulge with my husband in this poutine business. 

Poutine, a fare from the French Canadians where french fries are smothered in gravy and chunks of delicious cheese that works so perfectly. The gravy wasn't poured on there where all you end up with are soggy fries. It was a perfect balance where parts of the fries are a tad mooshy from the gravy (because that's how it is supposed.to be apparently) and the actual crisp of the fry. Honestly, it really is yummy! I think the poutine is something you must have if you are going for the first time or going as a frequent customer. There was nothing about this item as I ate it did I have a wish...you know, as you eat something you wish it was crisper, you wish it was hotter, you wish it was diced better, you wish it was sweeter, etc...

The bessssst part about this place is its pricing. 2 specialty cookies, 1 bar, 2 bottled waters, 1 scoop of ice cream, small cup of dole whip, 1 regular fries, and 1 regular order of poutine...all for 16 dollars and some change. I seriously thought that was a deal because we've had dessert/snack time at other establishments and that can get serious.

After spending nearly 2 hours in there, i discovered the service that i once thought of as an effort of trying too hard was clearly a misjudgment on my part. The lady who is the owner, I believe, was so sweet and so hospitable. It seriously felt like she knew every single person walking in. She just gave you that homely and welcoming feeling which I hope never goes away. A kind of service i am not accustomed to seeing which is why i assumed otherwise in the beginning. My fault!

They do have other food items on their menu, and I believe they offer their services for any specialty cakes and all that. Not really interested in the sandwiches they have to offer because we wouldn't really be coming in for the sandwiches anyway. 

So nice to have a cookie shop nearby and something of worth on our side of town! Hope they don't change their ways at all!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I absolutely loved this place! I wanted some dessert but wanted something different and from the minute I walked in I was greeted with incredible service!  I had never been there before so I asked what was good and she went over the dessert menu and different options that I wanted. She was so patient and everything is made to order!! EVEN THE DONUTS! I am beyond blown away and even though I live in Henderson you better believe I will drive 45min just to go here! 

I would recommend this place to everyone and anyone! You won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"Finally an ice cream/dessert shop in North Las Vegas that isn't part of a franchise! They had baked goodies like cannolis, Nutella brownies, etc., but I ordered the pineapple dole whip and a mango dole whip. It tasted just as expected--not creamy like Disneyland dole whip, but not like a sorbet either.
Minor thing that irked us a little though was the fact that we felt rushed. We walked in half an hour before closing and the girl at the counter kept asking \"What can I get for you?\" after we asked her for a second to look at the items on the menu and on the shelves. Since the girl obviously wanted to close up shop already, we ended up just getting the dole whip. We stayed there to eat our ice cream, by this time it was 9:40 (they close at 10), and all the girls working there came out from the back and started cleaning up. I get it that when it comes close to closing time, employees want to start cleaning up early so they won't be there all night, but if the hours outside say open until 10 and it's not even 10 yet, customers shouldn't feel rushed to have to leave. I've been to other small ice cream shops in town that close even later than 10 and they will not clean up until after their open hours. Even though this is in my side of town and they had good desserts, customer service is always a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"I know it's almost Christmas time and Santa is coming to town. Well he needs to stop by and get some cookies from Salted Malted !!! 

My brother actually brought these to me after a couple days of visiting there and to my surprise the cookies were still so soft and chewy as if they were freshly baked !  Prices are reasonably priced.  For the Southwest residents, not the ideal location ... it is quite the drive, however if I'm ever on that side of town ... I would definitely stop by for some snacks here."}
{"text":"Amazing sweets! This bakery has amazing cookies, ice cream and many other sweet delights. They will cure your sweet tooth!"}
{"text":"I come to this place just for the Dole Whip ice cream! It is amazing and tastes just like the ones in Disneyland! This is the only place in town that I know of that sells this."}
{"text":"Although I am sad for the demise of Goldilocks at this location, this place is AWESOME! Everything is super tasty, the owners and workers are hella nice, and did I mention everything is tasty? The only \"problem\" I have is that there are so many options that I always get confused when I order food. Oh, and the prices can't be beat! Where else can you get dole whip for 2 dollars?"}
{"text":"HOT AND NEW BUSINESS IN NORTH LAS VEGAS

I'm new to this part of Las Vegas and so is Salted Malted.
They are in their soft opening phase right now, but my first visit was a satisfying one.
I was looking around for donuts (of course) in this neck of the woods and this popped up on Yelp and then I remembered that it just opened.

Salted Malted offers a plethora of sweetness on the menu:
-Mini-donuts made to order:  specialty flavors include Froot Loops, Matcha Green Tea, Chocolate Red Chile, Root Beer, Amaretto, Coconut, Espresso, Butterscotch, and Cheez It.  Classic flavors are sugar, glazed, and cinnamon.
-Cookies:  Chocolate Chip, Churro, Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, Strawberry Cheesecake, Carrot Cake, Bacon Maple, and Pumpkin Latte flavors were in the cases when I was there.
-Thrifty Ice Cream with sundaes, malts, and shakes, as well as ice cream sandwiches available on cookies or waffles.
-Dole Whip:  Pineapple and Strawberry 

Plus, Peet's Coffee for your caffeine needs.

There's a lot going on here with Canadian favorites poutine as well as the Canuck, a peameal bacon  sandwich on a Kaiser roll based on a Toronto favorite, forthcoming.
I had six mini-donuts, two each of the Froot Loops, Cinnamon, and Chocolate Red Chile.  The latter definitely had a spicy kick to it.  All were tasty and fresh as I got to witness the little donuts being made.
I also left with three cookies to take home, the Churro (I love cinnamon, can you tell?), the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, and Carrot Cake.  The b/f and I shared the three and he absolutely loved the PB Chocolate Chip cookie.  I did, too:  it's a definite winner.
This place is dangerously close to us, but at least it gives me hope that more new businesses like this are coming to our neck of the woods in the north.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came in the 2nd time; this one was kinda sad. My sister-in-law ordered the donuts and they were burnt, which the lady was aware of and she gave them to us for free. The thing is that she didn't even offer us if she would like us to have them remade and just gave us the burnt ones. Also, i ordered a peanut butter cookie and it had a burnt taste to it also... I guess they were having a bad day or something."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! Saw the reviews and knew I had to check this place! Located across the street from Costco in North Las Vegas, poor tourists are missing out!

I was looking for lunch food rather than dessert. I ended up with the beef dip #2 meal. To upgrade to poutine was an extra $4 and some change, so the combo consisted of a sandwich, poutine and a bottled drink. The total came out to a little more than $15, which is a bit steep for a quick lunch. 

Luckily, although pricey, the food was FANTASTIC! The beef dip was incredible and the bun was full of tasty caraway seeds & smeared with creamy horseradish. 

The poutine is great and very filling. An order is definitely enough for at least 2 people. I took half to go.

Because I only wanted a club soda, the owner insisted that I at least pick out a cookie because I didn't get a bottled drink that was included with my meal. I picked out the chip cookie (topped with a potato chip) and although I was stuffed, I broke off a bit to try. SO DELICIOUS! 

While many bakeries are all show and no flavor, Salted Malted is the real deal. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"These are real, honest-to-goodness milk shakes and malts! They scoop and mix them the old fashioned way! Next time, I'm trying the poutine!  The baked good are homemade and delicious, too.  I go here way too much  and my waistline is showing it but I can't resist!"}
{"text":"I came for the donuts and ice cream!  But the donut machine was down.  I had a sundae which was delicious as were the poutine.  However I will edit my review after I try the donuts."}
{"text":"Hate to be a Debbie Downer, but was totally disappointed in this place especially after seeing some of the reviews.   The place was kind of messy...there were so many fingerprints on the display case just to name one.  The overall environment was not very inviting.   The display of desserts was not very appealing.   The key lime dessert we had was not very good in both the taste and presentation."}

Went on Saturday 9-26-15 around 8PM because I had a hankering for a dole whip.  This store is located in the Wal-Mart shopping center north of the 215 on Decatur.  When you enter the shopping center take a left and it's in the cluster of stores with Dickey's BBQ, Cuigino's, etc.  

As soon as I walked in and saw the automatic doughnut machine I got excited!!  Lots of shiny machines behind the counter...and loads of toppings for ice cream!   And then I noticed their case full of Thrifty ice cream and got immediately bored.  I don't know what I expected.  But with U-Swirl in the same shopping center I thought they would step up their game.  

The menu is pretty huge-not everything was available yet but it looks like in the future they're going to have breakfast and french fries. The menu is expansive and you can get everything from waffles to cookie sandwiches to a \"lime rickey\"...whatever that is LOL 

$2.16 got me a small pineapple/strawberry dole whip swirl in a cup.  The owner guy made a big deal out of telling me that he made it too big on purpose like \"wink, wink, you're welcome, sugar\".  While it was definitely the cheapest dole whip I've ever had it was also the most disappointing.  It was missing that pineapple punch-in-the-face that I'm used to and wasn't the right texture.  If you've never had a real dole whip before you might like it though.  Teddy Roosevelt said it best with \"Comparison is the thief of joy\".    

I'll come back when they have poutine because I've always wanted to try it and I'll grab some mini-donuts!!!"}
{"text":"I am saddened that this place had to close. They have the best cookies in Vegas, and of course the Poutine was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"I love their M&M cookies. When it comes to chocolate I crave a really rich chocolate flavor and these cookies are full of flavor. They were especially good when they were hot out of the oven."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot to satisfy your savory and sweet craving! I had some poutine (who doesn't like anything slathered in gravy and cheese?) And some dole whip. Both were tasty and worth coming back for more. They also have a variety of ice cream flavors, mini donuts, fresh baked cookies, some sandwiches and packed ice creamed!"}
{"text":"OMGosh!! The pineapple and mango dole whip is delicious? A tiny bit icey and yummmmm."}
{"text":"This is a fun gem on the far North side of town.  The cookies are delicious (and usually warm 0_0), you can watch them fry the donuts right in front of you, and, of course, there's ice cream.

I've only had a selection of the deserts (all delicious), but they also have a menu of \"real food\" that includes sandwiches and, wait for it, POUTINE!  Yes, the Canadian fat bomb is on the north side of town -- breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Not only is the food delicious, but seriously, all of the people I've talked to there are fantastic.  Everyone behind the counter is super helpful, nice, and understanding.  I met one of the owners who let me try the maple donuts (OMG so good).  

Everyone, GO HERE!  I hope they stay in business, because, seriously -- Their desserts are delicious.  Give them a shot -- you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We only had ice cream and donuts. Very tasty and great service."}
{"text":"Cute hole in the wall ice cream parlor. They won this Disney girl over with the simple fact they have dole whip! They also have the BEST churro ice cream sandwich in Las Vegas! Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Not quite what I was expecting. I love the name. I wanted a cafe not an ice cream parlor. I got the dole whip which was perfect. And tried the fresh made mini doughnuts. I wasn't all that impressed with them."}
{"text":"Butter tarts AND Nanaimo bars?   Poutine??!!  Canadian comfort food at it's best!  

Once I heard of Salted Malted's existence, I knew I had to make the trek out.  And the treats didn't disappoint. :)  Super friendly owners + great treats = winning combination.  

We tried the nanaimo bars, nutella bar, churro cookie, ginger molasses, both butter tarts and the maple bacon cookie.  All were great, but I have a slight preference for the ginger molasses cookies, butter tart and bars :)  Now if only they would bring in specialty nanaimo bar flavours like irish cream and peppermint I would be more than sold.

Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"You've got to try this place out once and see for yourself!  Def worth the hype!  Esp their sweets!   My fav is the Dole pineapple whip... heaven in a cup or cone.  Plus, everyone's so nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Employees there are really nice, establishment is well kept, food is amazing, the prices are good. Definitely worth going back!"}
{"text":"This tiny bakery is amazing! My sandwich was amazing and the poutine is the best ive ever had. I will be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"Very friendly, great service and the poutine was delicious.  I got the poutine with the works, bacon, cheese curds, fried egg and gravy.  Fried donuts and cannoli was insanely fabulous as well.  Need I say more?.....other than, I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"The Hubby and I only tried an ice cream cookie sandwich and both were so good! I got a maple bacon cookie and the chipper cookie (had potato chips in it) with salted caramel ice cream and the Hubby got a snicker doodle and sugar cookie with strawberry cheesecake sandwiched in-between. Definitely a great little place to check out. The staff was very friendly and answered all of our questions, definitely would visit again"}
{"text":"This place is amazing when I bring all my family here we always leave super happy and full. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that's looking for ice cream gelato fresh cookies and desserts has to make really good shakes the owner is really nice and treats as well every time we come in and employees are super friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"There aren't many good reasons for me to venture all the way to North Las Vegas, but when I was in the area recently I'm glad to have found Salted Malted. 

We didn't try any of their savory offerings, but we got a number of different cookies and bars to sample. The churro cookie, soft and amazing. My favorite of the offerings we chose. The rest of the flavors we tried were the carrot cake cookie was great. The heart breaker which is banana, chocolate and peanut butter tasted a little too overwhelmingly like banana for my taste but it was still good. The chipster had toffee and potato chips nestled in it. Amazing as well. Almost tied with the churro cookie as my favorite of the bunch. We rounded out our selections with a pumpkin bar and pumpkin latte cookie that were both excellent. 

Everything is freshly made and you can see they take a great amount of pride in their bakery goods so if I ever find myself in that part of town again, I will be back with a bigger appetite to try as much as I possibly can, including their Poutine and other baked goods."}
{"text":"Bookmarked this spot months ago!  Finally made it to Salted Malted Bakery & Creamery during one of our last trips to Vegas.  It is a long ways from the Las Vegas Strip, but they were worth the trip.  My sweet tooth was more than satisfied!!

Good thing that I don't live close by.  I'd be a lot heavier than I am now.  When I saw all those sweets displayed in their display cases, my tummy jumped for joy!   My eyes were immediately drawn to their Canadian Butter Tarts and Nanaimo Bars!!  Not very often that I find these beauties in the States!!

In addition to purchasing those items, we bought a few other goodies.

Churro cookie (3 stars)
Canadian Butter Tart (4.5 stars)
Almond toffee bar (4 stars)
Maple Bacon cookies (3 stars)
Nanaimo Bars (3.5 stars)
3 mini Cinnamon Sugar donut holes (4 stars)

As you can see, the Canadian Butter Tarts were my favorite!!  Nanaimo Bar was too sweet even for me.  Maple Bacon cookies I would have preferred without the bacon bits.  Nothing tasted bad, though.

I look forward to future excursions to Salted Malted Bakery & Creamery.  I need to try their Poutine!!!!  I was so bummed that I was too full to eat an order there.  Had to settle for taking out all those sweets to eat later in the day.  Thanks for sharing a piece of Canada in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Omg, this place is awesome!. I'm so sad they are so far from us. Their cookies and ice cream are the bomb!!!!!. Seriously try it, you have no idea what are you missing!. 

Open a branch in summerlin, please"}
