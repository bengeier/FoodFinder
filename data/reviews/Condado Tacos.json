{"text":"I really loved this place. There are so many ways to customize a taco here that I can't see how it would get old. The best part is the hard shell taco inside the soft shell and you won't leave here still hungry or broke like some other trendy spots. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I tried this joint again after an extremely subpar first experience. Confusion with the terrible menus continued. Servers were rude and didn't explain anything, including an extremely spicy sauce on the most basic premade taco on the menu that made a friend sick to her stomach. After the fact she joked that \"we're supposed to tell everyone about this\". 

The house margaritas are way too sweet and full of syrup. The only good thing was FAST service (and the tacos still didn't taste fresh) so we could get out of this place. Disappointing for such a prominent location."}
{"text":"One of the new wave of hipster, \"upscale\" taco joints in downtown Pittsburgh.

Not very impressed.  I've eaten here twice and tried a variety of menu items.
Ordering is overly complex, but does allow for extreme customization (although there are $1-$2 surcharges for many of the sections of options, so you could easily end up paying $12 for one taco).

Do not order the Chronic Tortilla Fritos (Ghost Pepper Steak nachos).  $7 and I counted 5 tiny bites of (bland) steak.  Mainly just a mound of cheese and lettuce.  And not spicy at all.  The dish makes me seriously question how much of the place is a marketing gimmick vs genuine restaurant.

I also ordered some rice as a side- $1 extra.  A small condiment sized container of possibly the most bland and clumpy white rice I've ever had (think of some high school cafeteria).  Very overpriced and disappointing.  Pass on that too

The El Santo was the favorite taco I tried and I'd rate it 7.5/10.  It was also the favorite taco of rest of my group.

The Good:
-Plenty of seating (unlike Tako which is crammed and rude and almost always pretentiously \"booked\")
-Prices are generally good. $4-$5 for a taco that is twice the size of most places (2 tacos should fill up nearly everyone).  $5 for most beers 

The Bad:
-Happy hour ONLY available in cramped downstairs while upstairs sits empty
-No chefs specials or drink specials (even the flavors of month are nothing more than naming gimmicks as the ingredients and flavors do not appear to be truly altered within the actual food)
-A la carte surcharges
-Bland sides, especially white rice
-Majority of taco options are bland and ordinary (despite the clever, misleading names)

Overall Condado Taco is an average taco place with above average prices.  They appear to have avant-garde flavors and combinations but in reality there is nothing differentiating.  Not overtly friendly but still much more appealing than the pretentious Tako.  
Probably the best trade off between price, value, flavor, and friendliness of all the new wave taco spots in downtown Pittsburgh, although unfortunately the bar isn't all that high."}
{"text":"Went to Condado for the first time today (Friday 4:00pm) and were seated immediately.  The food was AMAZING!  Although some other *newer* Mexican restaurants in the city are great, this place is legit.  Seriously, the best sit-down Mexican taco joint in the Burgh.  Order George's Dirty Taco and it will improve your outlook .  We will be back....tomorrow?"}
{"text":"Went here on opening night when they were giving away free tacos. The place was completely full even with the snow outside.

I ordered the El Santo taco and it was pretty good. It is basically a chicken taco with queso fresco. The twist is that it is in a soft and crunchy taco shell with some sort of sauce between. 

I also ordered the pomegranate margarita and the prickly pear margarita. They were both easy to drink and tasted like they were freshly made and not from some super sweet premixed bottle. 

The only negatives were that the free tacos were still on the bill when it came. The server corrected that and when I asked for a refill on the salsa the server brought out another order and charged us for it. Both of these problems were due to it being opening night and super busy. 

I'll definitely be back, especially when they open the rooftop deck."}
{"text":"Seriously always an amazing experience when we come. We have been in multiple times and love it. Prices are good, service is good, and food is amazing. I have never had food that I did not like from Condados! Love the pitchers of Margaritas."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. You have to get the queso and chips ridiculously good. The decor is pretty neat to. Prices are reasonable and there is no lack of flavor here. I will be back"}
{"text":"I think this place is really great if you're a picky eater. Tacos are create-you-own so it's very much catered to the individual who is nervous to try new things or who doesn't like to over-do their meal. With that being said, if you have high standards for Mexican food or just restaurant service in general, you will probably be happier going Tako or Bakersfield, or even Steel Cactus if you're looking for the going out vibe. Each taco is $3, but the add on's can get really excessive ($1 extra for sour cream...why??). The actual food is very comparable to something I can make at my house, but the overall vibe is really great for a cheap taco night with all of your friends. The ambiance and overall experience is great. And I must say, the margaritas are fantastic!! From someone who does not enjoy tequila, the margaritas were so delicious! Many of my friends ordered the margarita flight, which allows you to sample multiple flavors which we loved every single one."}
{"text":"Stopped on a whim for lazy Saturday lunch and so glad we did. Margaritas were awesome! 

We did the El Tres Amigos.. picked three \"dips\" for the chips. Pineapple Chipotle Guacamole, Queso and Corn Salsa. All were amazing. 

They had some cool tacos or you could make your own, which was our choice. 

Beef Brisket taco... great. Pulled Pork... amazing. 

Picked type of shell, toppings. It was fantastic. Service was on point. Everyone was friendly And helpful for first timers. The food came hot and fast and just amazed at how good it was. 

I would recommend a visit for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and queso! Great drinks and great location. Extremely well priced food with moderately priced drinks for the area. The waitress we had was great, very friendly and prompt;  but the bartender who we ordered drinks from while waiting for a table was not nearly as friendly. 

Overall a great additional to the Cultural District!"}
{"text":"Cmon, who doesnt love tacos? This place is great. Id been to the columbus locations in the past, very similar to the barrio chain of restaurants in the cleveland area, which probly has my favorite tacos anywhere. This place is about as good as it gets. Theres almost endless combinations for tacos, so youll definitely be able to find something you like. Aside from the tacos, the sides are great too. Good beer selection and a wide variety of margaritas and tequilas to chose from. Pretty cool place to hang out or hit up before/after a baseball game"}
{"text":"Definitely a nice addition to the Downtown area, unfortunately there were too many issues with my order to not be let down with my first experience here. I ordered three tacos to go, and I only received two tacos. On top of that, two of my shells were supposed to be hard shell, but I only received soft shell tacos. My second taco, a roasted pollo, was just a soggy mess. The bottom ripped open so I had to shred the shell and eat it with a fork. I won't completely blame them for that (because I ordered it to-go), but my office is a block away so I would've expected it to hold up better than that. The tacos tasted great, I just wish my order was correct - especially because they were not busy at all. I'll definitely be giving them another chance because the tacos were great, will update on how that visit goes!

I would've given them a 2 star review based on this experience, but I know they just opened up and I don't want to have one experience turn others away."}
{"text":"I'll freely admit I got lured in by all the skulls and stuff on the walls. Beyond the awesome skater decor, the food turned out to be awesome. Maybe not authentic mexican, but absolutely great. The different quesos are all really good and I ended up having maybe the Best. Nachos. Ever. Highly recommended. I enjoyed the build your own style menu that let's you customize everyone that makes your taco."}
{"text":"For New Year's Eve you would expect average service and food at any bar or restaurant. Wrong. This place was awesome. The tacos were amazing and it was 11pm. Drinks were great too. Excited to come back next time I'm in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"First let me say who should steer clear of Condado...  Mexican Purists: This is not your typical Mexican / Taco restaurant.  If you will get all pissed off because Condado taco's don't taste like every other taco you've eaten in your life you should stay away.  Snobs: Condado is small, it can get crowded and sometimes loud.  If you need somewhere quiet where you can spread out with your friends and talk about who has the best BMW you should probably go elsewhere.  Terrible Cooks:  This is a \"Build your own taco\" restaurant.  If you have absolutely no clue how flavors mix or a general idea of what flavors when put together would be pleasing to you, stay away (otherwise we will have to read your terrible review about how the food sucks, when in actuality it's you that sucks). 

Now let me say who should go to Condado...  Foodies:  If your life revolves around new flavors,  fusions, and pushing the boundaries of your taste pallet then Condado is a 100% must visit!  I cannot stress this enough, the mixture of outstanding options is a veritable amusement park for your mouth.  Date Budget Hawks:  In my opinion this is one of the best date night deals in Pittsburgh...  You can get two of the most exciting, original and personally tailored tacos in existence, with two sides and a margarita / craft beer for around ~$14 - 20 per person (even cheaper at happy hour).  And don't worry, unlike many local Mexican restaurants,  Condado's atmosphere is trendy enough to qualify as a legit date location.  

If you take a second to read the other reviews you will see the vast majority of 3 star or lower reviews come from people who didn't know WTF they were doing when they built their own taco or people who were pissed because the tacos were not \"authentic\" (as if eating the exact same king of taco you've eaten since kindergarten is some kind of great thing)..."}
{"text":"My husband & I found this place by chance, a few weeks ago,  & we are already returning customers! There is a variety of options for building your own tacos & the portions are great! Most importantly the tacos are delicious!!! A nice added bonus is their loyalty card, once your spend $50 you get $5 in credit for your next purchase!"}
{"text":"This was my first pit stop on my cinco de mayo bar crawl. Like every other Mexican place this bar was wall to wall packed. This restaurant has 2 bars so I headed upstairs. They have all types of margaritas banana, jalapeño and strawberry just to name a few. Since I had a long night ahead of me I ordered the cinco skinny margarita and some chips n salsa. Since it was super crowded they weren't using real glasses so no salt for my margarita since the salt won't stick to the cup . My margarita wasn't flavorful at all I know i removed some of the calories but this was flavorless. My chips and salsa arrived pretty quick. The chips were a lil dark for my liking and they didn't have any salt. And the salsa didn't help because it tasted like bland tomatoes. I took a glance at the menu and I liked the idea of Buliding your own taco. I may come back on a night that's not to busy to see if it's any better. Other than that this place is nothing to right home about"}
{"text":"Honestly not going to lie at all I've always been a big sucker for tacos and I was unsure how I was going to like this because I am a very picky eater. Plus I have my normal places I like to go. But one day while I worked in the strip district I decided to go for lunch with a coworker. 

Let me tell you I LOVE THESE TACOS. I was not sure at first because the staff was very excited and I was trying to get my order in and everything so I could make it back in time. But best tacos hands down I've had in months. Condado is going to be on the top of my list from now on for a to go taco place while in the burgh. 

I've heard so many raves about the margaritas and let me tell you I'm going to get my hands on one of those very soon!"}
{"text":"amazing staff, fun time, great food! although it's super weird that happy hour is only downstairs but other than that i love that place. centrally located too...where tonic used to be. if you're someone who likes to have a good time while you eat, go check it out!"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Didn't take everyone's drink order, then when food arrived, delivered none of the sides that were ordered. Seemed irritated that I asked to have sides we didn't receive removed from check, so I ended up paying for them anyways."}
{"text":"I got my family and friends hooked on Condados! We've been here numerous times over the past couple weeks and every time is great. The quality of the tacos are amazing and the price is even better. I love the flexibility of the ingredients. Their guacamole is also one of the best I've ever had. My fiancée's favorite is the queso."}
{"text":"It's burgatory but with tacos! Plenty of options including some great veggie choices (Thai chili tofu, bbq jackfruit). Happy hour is great. Half off tacos which start at 3.50 and half off drafts/ margaritas. You can add special toppings for more but I never see the need to. I'm usually full from 2 tacos and some chips and salsa vs the smaller taco size at nearby Bakersfield. The only complaint I have is how tight the tables are on the bottom floor. Either way, I don't care because I can't get enough of this place."}
{"text":"I'm updating this to 4 stars because today's experience was better. I do recommend not going in when they are busy because that's when things in there are the most chaotic with the service and food. Condado would be perfect if they worked on that. They are newer and I am giving them the benefit of the doubt, but I do always keep in mind that Bakersfield and Täk? are other lunch options."}
{"text":"Lots of options and tacos were great. Very busy and louder than normal (but in a good/lively way). Food was good (wish I could say the date was as well)!
Regardless when asked about how my date went, I continue to reply, the tacos were great!"}
{"text":"I ordered the BlackBerry house rita. Delicious. The Ooey-Gooey tacos were fab. Fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I would not waste your money going to this place.  There are much better places in the city such as Bakersfield and taKo if you are craving tacos.  The restaurant has build your own taco concept which sounds fun but the food was not good at all. I didn't even end up eating the tacos. There is almost no meat in them and the meat that is included does not taste good. I had the brisket and pork and you could tell which was which and both had a sweet sauce on them which was not tasty.  I also ordered a jalapeno margarita which I also couldn't drink because there was so much sour mixer in it.  I have to say I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I just tried this place the other day and will DEFINITELY be going back. The art decor is funky and very dia de los muertos. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were great. Very prompt and a great sense of humor. The music was being played off someone's playlist - which normally could be a nightmare but made it really fun to vibe to. 

Now the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5....the menus. I won't beat a dead horse based on the other reviews but yes, there are about 10 different menus and it was confusing as hell. I had to proactively ask what I needed to do to order properly as it wasn't really explained to us. Definitely overwhelming for anyone who has a hard time making choices.

That being said, the food was some of the best I've ever had. We got regular queso which had just enough spice/flavoring to it. The chips are freshly baked every day and were delicious. I ordered a hard shell corn taco with pulled brisket and a goody-goody soft shell with chicken. Both were AMAZING. The brisket was almost sweet, something that perfectly complimented the saltiness of the meat. The goody-goody came with 'crunch'....i dont know what the 'crunch' was made out of (neither did the waiter) but it gave a perfect amount of spice and texture to the taco. The chicken was incredibly moist and yummy. The side of black beans were the most flavorful plain black beans I've ever had. I don't even know how that happens.

The best part was the tacos were full size (not that tapas $5 for a scrap of meat crap) and at $3-6, you can't beat the price for the quality of food.

All-in-all, don't be scared to try this place bc of the menus. Explore, try new things, ask questions. It's far too delicious and inexpensive not to!"}
{"text":"A great spot for tacos for a number of reasons: 1) the selection - you can choose from pre-set options or create your own from their extensive menu; 2) the size - these ain't no tiny tacos, you get a well-sized taco; 3) the value - for what you're getting, these tacos are reasonably & competitively priced; 4) the ambiance - a wide-open restaurant, with a fun vibe.  A tad loud, but when I went (Saturday evening), it was to be expected; 5) the nachos - we got a mountain of nachos, far more than I expected, and they were excellent; 6) Margaritas - we got a pitcher of them, and we got plenty of delicious margaritas to go around!

All-in-all, a taco spot that is fun and definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great tacos. Have the option to build your own or go with pre-made ones both were delicious. It was our first time there and our waitress was super helpful guiding us through the ordering process. Delicious margaritas. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"friendly staff, awesome checklist style menu with tons of choices, and even better tacos. good drink selection too. would absolutely go back next time i am in pittsburgh"}
{"text":"An amazing example of casual, quality taco shop with style and character. Open late in downtown which is a rarity, anyone looking to crush some queso needs to be here. Great attentive staff, solid affordable pricing, and wonderful selection of tequila... who could want anything else?"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Tacos downtown! Amazing every time and great staff.  One time they messed up my order and comped my entire check, even the Margaritas!  Their Reward Card program is awesome too, every $50 spent, $5 off I believe, and it includes alcohol purchases.  Great for Meetings if you dont mind the hustle and bustle of downtown!"}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of weeks ago. And really enjoyed the concept - build your own taco.  Also the taste was fantastic.  Going back this week again."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos - build your own to customize them just the way you like it. Their guac is bomb.com. If you have no responsibilities after your meal, add a margarita pitcher to the tab :)"}
{"text":"I have not been here probably like 10 times and it has yet to disappoint. Great taco combos, especially love the tofu. Tried a lot of good quesos here too. Chips are great quality."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool and I liked that they have vegan options and there is outdoor seating but I left here unimpressed with the meal. 

On the plus side the tofu was tasty and the perfect amount of crispy but I feel like none of the topping selections really compliment the flavors. Everything else was lack luster. 

Unless you are a big yellow Gatorade fan I would skip the house margarita. It looks and tastes just like the sugary sports drink and think was a total waste of money. 

All in all if you are in the area and want to eat stop in but don't expect anything special."}
{"text":"The tacos are very delicious, but a bit pricey.  If you are looking for never ending variety in tacos, this is the place to be.  The margaritas are very good as well.  The restaurant is quite small so service seems to be good as they want to turn the tables quickly. It is very loud and dark in here, and everytime I come here it is super crowded."}
{"text":"Of all times to visit a Mexican restaurant my friends and I stumbled upon Condado on Cinco de Mayo.  We had a very large group 10+ and they were able to accomodate us upstairs.  The tacos are fantastic although some were very spicy!  I like how you can choose from the sheet what kind of tacos you want and the price point is really great for the quality of food you are getting.  We ordered pitchers of margaritas and they were just ok in my opinion.  The guac and queso was great though to start.  Will definitely make a trip back when I am in the area again!"}
{"text":"Love the shrimp ceviche tacos here. They make my mouth happy! This was my second time for dinner here and it was as good as I remembered. The tortilla chips were much less greasy this time, probably because it wasn't as busy as the Saturday night I was here last time. 
Only downside was the downstairs female bartender. She was completely miserable, acted like it was an inconvenience to take and make our drink order. She never spoke a word to me. Some of the worst service I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hours the margs are bomb and the tacos looked good! I did not personally order any but I was with a large group of people and they all enjoyed their food! A good place for larger groups because they will accommodate you nicely."}
{"text":"Yummy (but messy) tacos and good margarita! I will definitely be returning to this place for late night noms if I'm ever downtown. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because my girlfriend and I split a pitcher of margs (about 6 margs - good deal) but neither of us really felt like there was alcohol in it. Also DO NOT order the side of rice. It's just a small container of white rice drenched in pepper. Not at all worth it or good. But other than that it was yummy!"}
{"text":"Went to Condado for Happy Hour and it was delicious! Half off margaritas did not disappoint. I had a pomegranate and a spicy marg-- beware it is VERY spicy. We ordered the trio and the queso, guac (get the Tuscan!) and salsa were all so good I couldn't pick a favorite. I also loved that I was able to make my tacos to order because I can be a bit picky with my toppings. Try the BBQ pulled jackfruit in a taco -- vegetarian or not.. you'll love it."}
{"text":"These tacos were some of the best tacos I've ever tasted.

Highly recommend the chicken and pulled pork tacos. They ARE a little spicey so make sure you're prepared. Each taco comes with a soft shell and a hard shell. I thought it was weird till I tasted it. It totally works.

Longer lines but they crank people through here."}
{"text":"I love that you can build your own tacos!! And the drinks are amazing. A huge tequila selection. I wish we had one in Detroit! A place like this would just boom! - the staff also gave us amazing advice on places to visit."}
{"text":"LOVE these tacos. They are delicious and you get to build you own! To me, it' doesn't get much better than that. They are very filling and tasty. Would recommend to anyone looking for a cool place to try!"}
{"text":"Go here!!! They have a great deal on build your own tacos or select some from their menu. Blood orange margaritas are excellent. Parking is a pain but it's in downtown so of course it is."}
{"text":"Great build-your-own tacos and chips and queso blanco. Right across from the Westin and really close to DLCC. Definitely check it out if you're in town for a convention (like Anthrocon)."}
{"text":"Mostly toppings and sauce. My stomach was left unhappy and my tongue was uninspired. For all of the complexity of their ingredients, they didn't mesh well. 
Nice bar staff, average food."}
{"text":"All around, such a unique place! The tacos are intriguing, the art is... weird. But it's cool, at the same time. Basically how it works is you pick and choose your toppings and it's great! Tofu? Yes. Jackfruit? Uh, yes. Chicken, onions, salsa... There is so much variety which makes it really fun and REALLY tasty.

For two tacos and all that I put in it I expected it to be a little more filled, but that's okay! I was still satisfied with this for lunch, and it's really reasonably priced. This is a cool chain that I'd never heard of, but it'd totally have it again!"}
{"text":"I've visited Condado's numerous times. Every visit is 5/5 stars for food and drinks! 4/5 stars for staff... only because they get very busy and you have to wait awhile at times to get fresh drinks. This review is only 4/5 stars, because we visited last night pretty late and were told the kitchen was still open but was closing soon. So we put in our taco orders and the food was served quiet quickly. However, everyone's tacos were cold... be advised you will not get freshly cooked food if you order close to kitchen closing."}
{"text":"Great food, and service. Usually pretty fast unless there is a lot of happenings downtown...then you may wait a bit. You can build your own tacos which helps in getting exactly what you want. Also great margaritas."}
{"text":"Another downtown taco place but what sets this restaurant apart is its extensive menu that you can personalize as well as an amazing happy hour spot!  Happy hour goes until 7 (our waitress thought it was 6 and we rushed to get our order in but were happy when she told us 7 and another round of drinks for us).  The beer list is extensive with a lot of unique options then there is a ton of cocktails including margaritas. At happy hour the drafts are $1 and the margaritas are 1/2 off.  All of the margaritas are served on the rocks-no frozen which I was a bit disappointed about.  You can add flavor for a $1 including peach, pomegranate, strawberry and blackberry which basically is them adding a pump of flavor to their original margarita. I tried the peach and strawberry and my husband had the blackberry. I recommend the strawberry as the blackberry was super sweet and the peach really didn't taste much different than regular.   You then have a few salsas, guacamole and queso to pick from served with chips which is a great started. We went with their roja salsa and regular guacamole. Unfortunately, they never brought us the salsa but that was ok as the guacamole was such a huge serving we could hardly eat it and I love guc!  The chips are very thick and not too greasy.   The hard part is next which is choosing your tacos. You have so many options from a bowl to flour or corn tortilla with a ton of veggie or meat options, fillings and sauces. I went with the flour soft shells, one with chicken the other with beef.  The shells were a bit hard and I did not like my creamy lime sauce but everything else was tasty. For an extra $1-$2 you can add beans or rice which comes served in a little cup.  Did I mention that the happy hour special is $3 tacos.  Pretty great deal. Our waitress was fantastic and it was packed-we were lucky to get  seated upstairs with a very short wait."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on Condado. On one hand, I liked the decor and the overall vibe of the place, and I generally liked my tacos; but on the other hand, I was super overwhelmed and unsure of the create your own taco menu. 

It could have honestly been a combination of not being sure how all the toppings would taste with the proteins I chose and the lack of description/explanation from our server. Basically, I happened to make a few lucky choices and enjoyed my meal. My friends went through the same battle and, while a few of us chose the exact same taco, they looked completely different. One girl appeared to have the table's portions of cilantro entirely in one taco, other tacos were missing guacamole, and the sauces on a few were completely skipped. I think a quality control check is needed!

Lastly, they had a million different menus. I don't get it. There was a create your own taco menu, a premade taco menu, a drink menu with beer/liquor and then some other drink menu. Just combine them. Too much going on, too many moving parts. 

I'm willing to take another shot at Condado because I did enjoy the flavors, I just hope it's easier for me to navigate the menu!"}
{"text":"I went to Condados with some girl friends and we were able to score some happy hour drinks at the bar before heading up to our table (although next time I will definitely try to the margarita flight). The menu is a build your own taco which is great because you can customize everything. We also shared a trio of dips which were flavorful without being too spicy.  I don't recall our exact order but there are many varieties of salsa and queso to try. This is definitely a great place for a group as there are tacos that will please anyone with any food restrictions."}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh 5 days and ended up eating here 3 times. Hard corn house-made shells were amazing, ingredients exceptional and fresh, build your own selections are vast, and all-in everything is extremely delicious. Excellent cocktail margaritas (on the rocks, as they should be, not blended) with real fruit juices, not bar mix. Ghost pepper steak is exceptional. This place is killer."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a great location, sharing the street with a lot of other interesting places to eat. I wish I would have tried one of them instead. Their tacos were good, but not great, and service was worse. On the upside, the atmosphere is buzzing even on a weeknight. The downstairs bar was packed, and upstairs had a fun mix of professionals getting drinks after work and hipsters on dates. Be sure to check out the sweet murals - You can't miss the art on every wall!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times and I'm still not impressed. I've tried different tacos each time, but I still feel like I could make them at home. When I go out to eat, I want to feel like I couldn't make the dish at home. One nice feature Condado has, though, is a build your own taco menu. I like the personalization factor!"}
{"text":"My hubby surprised with with a lunch date and he chose this place because, tacos! 
We entered at about 1:00 pm and had no trouble getting a seat upstairs.  The hostess and wait staff were very friendly and efficient.

 Our eyes were much larger than our bellies this trip - we ordered way too much food!  We started with the Queso dip. $6 and a good size serving.  The chips were very crispy and fresh.  We both ordered 3 tacos (yeah, I know!) and decided to stick with the suggestions rather than create our own (or I would have been there all day!)  I ordered the Ooey-Gooey, El  Tradicional and the El Santo.  They each were unique and tasty in their own way.  There was a nice amount of heat to each one and there were a pretty good size.   The sides come in a small cup and are really nothing to write home about (we got the rice and bacon refried beans.

Overall, we had a good experience here and will be back.  I like the concept of create your own taco - I think I will try that the next time."}
{"text":"First of all....YUM. If you're looking for good eats & drinks, I definitely recommend Condado! My girlfriends and I met here on a Monday during happy hour (5-7 PM). We first started off with the El Tres Amigos - which was a sampler of their dips. We ordered the salsa roja, Diablo queso, and the traditional guacamole. Since the salsa roja is like their \"house salsa\", our waitress asked us to choose one more to try & so we got the ghost pepper roja salsa! All 4 were so delicious. Although a couple were described as spicy, they weren't overwhelming to me. I chose to build my own tacos and ordered two. It was the perfect amount! They did have a list of tacos that were already made but I chose to make my own. Since we were there for happy hour, I decided to have a couple mango margaritas. It was very sweet & delicious! I can't wait to go back and try other combos of tacos!"}
{"text":"We've come at least a half dozen times since Condado opened and they have really hit their stride.  Alex and Jason are both great to us when we visit and the huge combination of flavors and menu choices will keep us coming back.  They loyalty card doesn't hurt either - straight forward and easy to use.

The steak nacho bowl is great for two to share."}
{"text":"absolutely amazing! if you're looking for a fun trendy place to drink some fun margaritas and design your own street tacos, this is your place. I ordered the shrimp ceviche, beef brisket, and chili tofu. only complaint is that the beef was slightly dry but definitely didn't stop me from eating the entire taco! I would recommend this place to anyone and I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We've heard good things about this place and were excited to try out a new taco joint hoping it was different than the other ten that are in town. 

We arrived and were quickly seated at a table that was far too small for two people. We only ordered drinks, chips and tacos but they didn't fit on our table. 

The service was slow and our server acted like she had better things to do. We waited over 20 minutes for our drinks and in that time we contemplated leaving. We stayed because we were so hungry and hoped anything we ordered would change our minds.

 We both ordered a few tacos including the surf and turf taco which we were told wasn't ready yet because he seviche wasn't prepared. It was happy hour, so assuming it was a busy time it should have been prepared. We didn't replace it with something else and quickly ate so we could get out of there. 

Maybe it was a bad day for our server or something but we wanted to love it based on the new twist it brought to tacos. We left and walked to Bakersfield down the street. We may be back if everything else is booked."}
{"text":"Had a blast here. Had some tacos and craft beers. You order on sheets and it is super easy to get everything you want. I got pulled jackfruit and it was great. Waitstaff was over the top nice. We went here after having a poor experience at Tako so even walking in not in a great mood they won us over."}
{"text":"I have been here twice so far and have loved the food I ordered both times.

Got there before 4:30 (on a Friday) the first time I went, downstairs was already pretty full so my friend and I went upstairs and sat at the bar. The one big negative from this visit was the bartender did not tell us that happy hour was downstairs only and we found out when we over heard her telling others later. In general people were unhappy to hear that. I heard several complaints from others once they found out. It doesn't make much sense to me either but I know nothing about the restaurant business. Other than that the food was good and came out quickly. 

Second time I went was a Saturday afternoon, the downstairs was pretty full again so we went upstairs not expecting happy hour prices. Three of us split the El Tres Amigos and ordered build your own tacos. The issues with this trip was first with the Dirty Queso we ordered. On the menu it says 'chicken, black beans, onions, dirty sauce' when we received it it was just plain queso with a little of the dirty sauce drizzled on top.. Kind of annoying, if your out of it just tell us, don't try to fake it. It was still damn delicious but we wanted to try something different. My friend ordered one drink and a different server brought her a different drink and said something like 'well just give it a try' and walked away. Our server came over and apologized for the mix up and said if she wanted the correct drink it's not a problem. Not a huge biggie at all, probably wouldn't even have mentioned it but it was the weird way the first girl handled it that made all of us say 'wtf'. Once we received the rest of our food we were happy campers. Two of my friends were going to order more drinks but we hadn't seen our server in some time so by the time she did come over we decided to go elsewhere for further drinking.

Food is wonderful, service could use some work but it's still new. I will probably stick to Sienna and Bakersfield for drinks though! (note: I was going to give this 3 stars for the service and other mix ups but I just really liked the food and food prices!)"}
{"text":"couldn't get a seat in the happy hour section but who cares, the tacos are worth full price. tasty margs and quick/ efficient service, I'll be back... soon"}
{"text":"I think everyone who frequents the downtown restaurant scene would agree with me that the market is flooded with taco restaurants. Condado was the latest to join and at first I was thinking \"really, more tacos??\" However, I think Condado brings something different and I find myself coming here quite often. 

This is a create your own taco place even though I've actually never done that. The gazillion different options kind of overwhelms me so I usually get the pre-designed tacos. I've tried a number of items from their \"Taco Suggestions\" menu and my favorites would have to be \"The Mantis\" and \"Surf n Turf.\" I typically don't go with vegetarian options but The Mantis is to die for! Condado's tacos are quite substantial (I'm usually full after two) and they are also super affordable. 

While the space might seem small, there is a whole second level. Service is also pretty quick so it's a great place for a quick lunch! Although I'd be ok with Condado's tacos any time of day!"}
{"text":"Downtown is filling up with taco spots. Normally I wouldn't complain because tacos are my all time favorite food, throw in some chips/salsa/guac and a cool pitcher of margaritas and I'm in heaven. My friend and I decided to stop here on our way to the penguins game. We always feel like getting tacos before the game is good luck. 
Condado is in the old Tonic space which is awesome and it truly looks great in there!
The waiter explains the whole ordering processs, explains the menu, and gives up a run down of cocktails. 
We proclaimed \"Pitcher of hour margaritas please\" and the waiter obliged. The pitcher came, he graciously poured our first glasses for us (it tends to spill from the pitcher sometimes). We both gave each other a look of \"oh no! These are NEON GREEN! EEEK\". The house marg tasted like what I used to make in college/late highschool. That neon green unnatural color mixer and whatever tequila was cheapest but not total shit. It was palatable but with all the insurgence of taco places downtown, it was by far the most disappointing I've had. Maybe I should have sprung for the more expensive version, I don't know.
We ordered the queso diablo. Jalapenos, habenero, and onion. The queso was really good. Very smooth. The chips are made in house, which I LOVE. They were a LITTLE greasy and definitely salty (but I love salt). We even got a refil of chips to finish the queso with. So far my experience was at a 50% enjoying and liking the food and 50% that margarita was subpar.
We each get 2 tacos, my friend gets a shrimp and a tofu one. I get brisket and chicken. We make our own tacos. There are SO MANY CHOICES. It's very similar to how burgatory does their build your own. I probably made some wrong choices but my tacos were \"meh\". I had my chicken one with the sweet lucy shell (seriously...it's Amazing) and i really liked that one. I was not a fan of the brisket. It had a weird flavor I just couldn't place. My friend said her tacos were \"ok, but I feel like when given the option I'm going to choose the wrong toppings and ruin my taco\". 
We closed out and went on our merry way about town to the game. 
I would probably hit this place for happy hour and get some appetizers, but I think the margs and tacos have a way to go. 
Big props on the multiple vegan/vegetarian options though!!!"}
{"text":"Brother in law recommended this place when visiting Pgh! 2 floors and you fill in the dots like an old grade school test for how you want your tacos made (so any mess up is on you lol)!!! Get rum and they have Old Style beer from Chicago also!!! Server/ waiter Mikey was great also!!!! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Fun little spot right across the street from our hotel right in the heart of downtown. We ended up hitting up Condado Tacos at around 11:00pm on a Saturday night after the Cubs Pirates game and the place was packed. Drinks were very good. Tacos were good but one of mine had a bit too much sour cream. Its a pretty cool concept for a Mexican/taco joint, almost like ordering off a sushi menu. There are paper menu tickets and pencils at every table and you just mark of the taco you want and how many or you can mark off custom taco by checking individual ingredient boxes, example, type of tortilla, type of meat/protein, type of cheese, types of vegies, etc. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good tacos, they have many traditional as well as unique taco offerings."}
{"text":"The best goddamn tacos in the burgh.  Best happy hour, best margaritas, plus Sarah kicked ass helping us figure out what the fuck was going on.  Also, totally recommend the Blanco corn queso... Phenomnomnomz"}
{"text":"Ghost pepper sauce is amazing! I want to buy it by the gallon. I was a little disappointed they didn't have the michiliadas ready yet but they were on the menu. My boyfriend moved here from Cleveland and missed Barrio and prefers Condado because the food is just as good but the drink prices are better. And he is a chef who worked at the hottest hotel in Cleveland. He also says the wait staff in the Burgh, although new, by far out shows the staff at Barrio in Cleveland. We win. I won't go downtown for anything but jury duty or this place. High praise. I'm so glad they came here!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos need not say more, tons of options the combinations are nearly never ending. Excellent beer selection."}
{"text":"We had a blast here! It was across the street from our hotel so we just stumbled upon it but the tacos were excellent (we got a variety and weren't disappointed by any) and we also really enjoyed our margarita pitcher. Any place you can get great tacos and margaritas is a win. Definitely a young, hip vibe but we didn't feel out of place being some of the older people in the place. Service was great as well. Art on the walls was beautiful. Would visit again and highly recommend to others."}
{"text":"You can't go to a taco place on a Friday night and expect NOT to wait an hour for a table...and that's just what we did. When our text came in that our table was ready, the hostess looked at us like we were aliens and said there wasn't a table for us (even though we saw many empty ones). Off to a rocky start!! Once we made ourselves known three times we finally were seated. 

I had been forewarned that there are MANY menus. I don't think I took my friends seriously enough. There was a drink menu, appetizer menu, pre-made taco menu, build your own taco menu, and I think one more. Our waitress did explain everything briefly, but we felt like we were left to our own demise. Thankfully, everyone in our group was ready to be adventurous and build tacos from the very yummy options. 

We started with the blanco nacho cheese and corn salsa. YUM. I would go back just for the apps. We all built our own tacos and there wasn't a sad soul at the table. Everything was flavorful, hot, and delicious. Absolutely worth the wait and confusion. I will be going back!!"}
{"text":"I am very torn about this 3 star rating. I was super excited to try this place because I have heard GREAT things, and I love tacos like the rest of the world, so this was a must try for me. I went with a group of 5 on a Saturday evening, and there was no trouble getting a seat. There are two floors, which is really nice. There is outside seating, but not for more than two per table due to limited space. 

There are like a million different menus when you sit down, so just be sure to look at all of them. There are drink menus, taco menus, taco shell description menus, and build your own taco menus. It was a little overwhelming for me, to be honest. I decided to build my own tacos and I legit had no idea what I was doing. Our server gave us a general run down, but we were basically on our own when it came to figuring out what the proteins and toppings were. 

I couldn't even tell you the toppings I put on anything because I basically just panicked, blacked out, and selected things. I only have myself to blame for the tacos I made, I know that. I picked the beef brisket and pulled pork for my proteins, and they were both ok. I did pick one of the \"fancier\" taco shell choices, and I was pretty happy with it, but I didn't know what I was getting until it came out. My friend had a shell that was like a cheesy gordita from taco bell, which seemed like a nice treat.

The decor was really cool, and I really was digging the vibe. The beer list was lengthy and they have an EXTENSIVE list for tequilas. Honestly, I just think I'm the type of person that doesn't do well with an endless amount of choices. I need a little more guidance. I will not write this place off just yet, I'm hoping to have a better experience next time!"}
{"text":"Queso is fire.  Never had bad service.  Huge tequila selection, draft beers that are actually decent.. plus the art on the walls is dope af."}
{"text":"I typically never order tacos because I'm picky as all hell, but this place lets you build your own! I met my friend here for lunch last Friday, and it wasn't even our first choice.  We tried three other restaurants but they were all packed to the brim. We both mentioned Condado and said we had yet to try it so we might as well give it a try.  We got seated right away and even got a seat on their patio area.  I consider myself a queso connoisseur and their queso is bomb.  Honestly though, the tacos were the best part.  I believe I go the ju-ju shell which was essentially a hard shell nestled inside a soft shell glued together with their queso - amazing.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Condado for quite some time and it did not disappoint! As a new staple in the cultural district, and downtown in general, Condado is an awesome choice that doesn't break the bank and that's sometimes hard to find downtown! 

The atmosphere is unique and exciting with two floors, both featuring their own full service bar! I went on a Saturday around noon before an event at the convention center and we were able to get a table without a wait. 

The menu features both create-your-own tacos ad well as predesigned tacos. I decided to go with the ones they had created! I ordered an ooey gooey and and el tradicional. They ooey gooey rocked my world while the other left me wanting more. I didn't love the soft corn tortilla. We also split an order of queso and be prepared for a huge bowl to come your way. I don't ever do Mexican without queso and this didn't disappoint. 

When the bill came and all was said and done it was $12...I was full, happy, and ready to go! I can't wait to go back and design some of my own tacos next time and check out more of their queso varieties!"}
{"text":"Amazing tacos.  Get the Lucy shell or other one that has hard shell inside soft shell.  Also great drinks and beers.   Tacos are not the \"try hard\" fancy style like at Bakersfield that I find over rated. This is a cool spot with delicious filling tacos."}
{"text":"I first visited Condado when they opened in Pittsburgh and was not impressed. This visit was much better! 

Meet some friends for happy hour. You can't beat the special here! 

Drinks: Extensive drink menu with so many margarita flavors. I had the blood orange and will have it again in the future! My friends had Blackberry and pomegranate, which were also very good. They even offer margarita flights to sample some of the flavors. 

Food: We had the usual chips and queso to start. Nothing special, but how can you not? Then we ordered tacos. They have a preset menu or you can build your own. I did a build-your-own with chorizo. Very good! I had the pulled chicken before and was not as impressed. The tacos are a generous size. Order two for a complete meal. The build-you-own menu offers a number of salsas/tortillas/meats/toppings - you can't go wrong! 

Space: Condado has two floors. We sat downstairs. Seating is tight! Just a heads up if that's not your thing... 

Super excited to make this a go to happy hour stop this summer!"}
{"text":"The service was cheerful and accommodating. The tacos were not authentic. The corn tortilla was crunchy, not soft. The black beans on my veg taco had that canned taste. The food at this place is not memorable."}
{"text":"Best happy hour ever. $1 off tacos and $3 delicious margaritas. Create your own tacos! The queso is amazing. I'd suggest ordering 2 tacos as they are pretty large. The carnitas and chorizo are the best. If you don't add any extras, tacos are only $2.50 during happy hour, 5-7 pm. However, you need to try one of the cool shells with toppings inside!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco place in town! And I've tried them all! Love that you can make your own. Staff can be a bit more attentive but it's ok."}
{"text":"I had friends in from out of town and thought it was the perfect chance to try Condado.  While driving from the Latrobe airport, i called at 7:15pm and asked for a reservation for 8pm.  I was told on the phone that a reservation wasn't needed and we could easily walk in for a table.  I told them we had 4 people and they assured me it would be no problem to get a seat at 8pm.

So..I get downtown, pay to park my car, we walk three blocks and reach Condado to find it's completely packed.  The hostess told us we had to wait and there were three parties ahead of us - not sure how long the wait was.  There was no room at the bar to stand or any room upstairs.  We awkwardly stood around, often in the way of the wait staff and other patrons standing around waiting for a table. We could see empty tables around and more that were being cleaned so we hoped it wouldn't be long.

8:30pm comes around and we were still waiting.  The empty tables we saw were being filled and more people we waiting.  I went to the hostess station to ask what the deal was and was told that \"There's 2 parties in front of you..\".  Over the course of 30 minutes the only seated one party?  Not buying that.  My friends and I were hungry so we left.  Before I left I chatted with a guy at the bar who was leaving as well - told me he ordered his food and waited 35 minutes but they lost his order and he never got it.

I hoped after being open for a month they would work out any kinks they might have.  If I would have wandered in at 8pm and had this experience that's one thing - but not taking a reservation and having your patrons waste their time is another.  Why not take a reservation, it's guaranteed business?  

I can't comment on the food, but the decor was cool i guess.  I hope other ppl get better customer service than I received."}
{"text":"OMG.   Very cheap for the quality of food you get. Nachos are a steal for $5.  Would not waste the money on queso.  Chips are some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Awesome vegetarian and vegan options, if this was near me I'd come here all the time! I stopped in during a work trip to Pittsburgh based on a co-worker's recommendation. It was packed on a Saturday night so I ordered takeout. The hostess and bartender were very helpful and my order was out in less than 10 minutes. Both the Mantis and the Dutch Dragon were absolutely delicious. It can be tough to find creative and tasty vegetarian tacos and the flavors in both of these were perfect! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Yeah, kind of in love with this place. Good liquor. GREAT tacos. I was staying nearby for a convention and I loved it so much I went 4 times in 3 days! Best tacos I've ever had. I want this place to come to my rural Iowa town!! It would be huge here with our private, liberal arts college. Everyone would come from miles around just for this. The prices were spot on, the food was filling and delicious without being greasy at all. (A complaint I have with other taco places.)

I tried a variety of their options, but my favorite was easily the pulled pork with the Sweet Lucy shell ( flour soft + corn hard + queso + guac) and a side of chips with the Elote queso dip. Everything was FRESH and I love that it's a build your own kind of place. I need to go back and do more research and try other combinations.

GO THERE NOW."}
{"text":"I love these tacos, but I'm pretty sad about my latest experience here. I work a lot of tough hours at a catering kitchen and farmers markets. After today's downtown lunchtime market, I walked my sweaty, tired self several blocks to order 5 tacos and a couple sides, for a later dinner (and next day's lunch) with my husband. I got a water and beer while I waited, and my takeout order came out pretty quickly. I asked if it was 5 vegetarian tacos and the young man said yes. I gave a quick glance into the bag to make sure it looked like my order.  after I left a tip and finished my beer, I crossed the street to wait for the bus. Rode the crowded bus home, walked up the big ass hill to my house and when I went to put the stuff in the fridge, I was bummed to see I was one taco short. Since I had been bagging and checking other people's food orders all day, I really wanted to be able to trust the Condado staff to do their jobs and check mine. And yes, I got charged for the whole order."}
{"text":"So on a whim, my coworkers and I went here.  Drinks, food, and specials out of this world....  It's now our Friday spot.  Great service."}
{"text":"Customer Service was amazing but the food wasn't great. The tortilla on the tacos were really cold. Tacos weren't so great. For the quality of food they serve, the price is too expensive. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos and margaritas. I got the taco with the soft shell and the hard shell and it was great. We also got the queso which was thick and very delicious. The service was great and the location was easy to get to. The aesthetic of the place was very cute and I would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, downtown Pittsburgh offered very little to chose from when you wanted a taco, now there are several Mexican/taco options downtown Pittsburgh. Condado offers delicious taco options at moderate prices. I suggest creating your own taco and coupling if with a margarita if it isn't lunch time.  Not a huge fan of the Day of the Dead decor, but if you like it, Condado is the place to visit. It is a great place for a quick lunch. Can get loud."}
{"text":"First off, I'm always impressed with a place that has more than one vegan option. That's chili tofu and the barbecue jackfruit were the two \"meat\" options. I'm not a huge fan of jackfruit so I skipped that but the tofu was cooked perfectly. It has the perfect amount of flavor and texture. I went with making my own taco (4) and didn't realize the tacos were very generous sizes. Bigger than most taco places, so maybe I could have gone with three. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just got done with our meal at Condado Tacos. First off, the food and drink at Condado Tacos was phenomenal. We also loved the concept of the order sheet. The bummer is that the hostess was very rude. We were seated close to the hostess stand and she was rude to everyone that walked in. As she is the first person you see, we feel that this gave a negative feeling to the experience. Also, she complained multiple times when we were eating and she complained with another coworker. This needs to be corrected by management as this is makes the restaurant not as pleasant. Aside from that, everything was great with both our servers being nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Went here after a Penguins game in search of good, unique tacos. Got a dip trio, which comes with two salsas also. Highly recommend the chorizo queso, my dip of choice of the 5. 

For drinks, my husband got the traditional Marg and I went mango. Yum, although no salt on the rim. I'm sure you could get some if you asked, but that's usually a given for a Marg. 

When it came to taco time, I wanted to go with ones on the list because I often think the chef knows what meats, Vegis, and sauces pair together best for the ultimate tasty taco. Unfortunately, of the list of about 10 tacos, there was like one chicken and one beef and the rest were vegetarian or vegan friendly with no meat. I'm all for having these options, but carnivores like me want a taco with some substance. I don't know if they'd add meat to the vegan and veg options, but I opted to just create my own instead at that point. I did one with brisket and one with pulled pork. I made sure to add different Vegis, sauces, and shell choices to each so I could sample as much as I could from their list of add ons. I've gotta say, I made two pretty perfect creations. All the ingredients were fresh, my brisket one was my fav. This could be partly due to the fact that after all the dips and taco #1 I had no room for taco #2, so it went home with me and was reheated for lunch the next day. 

I'd def return, and it was a nice simple walk from PPG Paints for a post-game dinner. But my only suggestion would definitely be to have more suggested tacos including meats."}
{"text":"Condado has fantastic build your own tacos. There are plenty of options, including delicious vegetarian options like marinated portobello and chili tofu. I really enjoy the Sweet Lucy shell which has queso built into it. I recommend ordering the margarita of the month. It's always delicious and creative. The only downside is that this place is packed at all hours. That's because it's so great!"}
{"text":"Very quality tacos, service is usually pretty good, a little bit pricey but overall worth the trip 

Not the best tacos in Pittsburgh but very good ones"}
{"text":"I love the tacos here. How can you complain when you get to build your own? Their ingredients are fresh and always tasty. Not to mention, this is one of the only places that you can get late night food in downtown Pittsburgh.

Also, I'm a huge fan of the bar. It closes at 2 am every night. They have a really good draft selection, as well as awesome tequilas. There is limited seating at the bar, as it's usually filled up."}
{"text":"Looking for the jammest hipster taco spot in Pittsburgh? Looking for a way to order queso and also order something dirty in the same phrase? This is your spot. Might be a wait for a table, but more than worth it. Dirty queso isn't a sex act, it's a life changing dip."}
{"text":"food wasnt bad. prices were pretty just. it was clear our server had to pinch a loaf or something tho.she was very much boom!!!i'mhereinyourfaceimkindashoutingandtellingyouwhattoorderokbyenowimgonefortwentyminutesatatime,heresypurcheckhurryupimwipingthetabledownwhileypustillfinisjyourdrinkokbye!!!"}
{"text":"I was really rooting for you guys since this is only feet away from my work. The food was bland and didn't have much of an \"authentic\" flavor.... or even any flavor at all. I ordered three tacos and they were heavily stuffed and I couldn't even begin the eat the third once (which I guess the portion is the only good thing). The price isn't too bad but there isn't much meat for $4-$5 per taco. I wish that it didn't taste like beans from a can and instant rice.



I went back again for their happy hour. On the front page of their website it stated that happy hour was from 4-7pm (it has now been updated) but I arrived at 4:35pm and the server would not honor it. He said that happy hour started at 5... I order chips and queso for my group. The chips tasted burnt and the queso was again bland as expected. The margaritas were decent but our server took about 15 minutes to bring each out for a member of our group when there were only 5 people... the place was busy but it's such a small place that busy means 30 people all together."}
{"text":"While I loved the food here, and I've been here a few times, this place has given my friend and my husband food poisoning. 

I was there a couple days ago and I got something to go for my husband and my friend and I dined in. The food came out so quickly, and we were super grateful for that, however, now that it's been 24 hrs, we think that some of the food must have been sitting out. 

My husband has been throwing up all night, and my friend has diarrhea and nausea. 

It sucks because the food was so good, but two separate people that had separate meals, one who dined in and one who had take out are both extremely sick. I encourage this restaurant to not be lazy and cook all of their food in a timely fashion. People go to restaurants expecting to wait. Don't cut corners. I pray this is just a temporary bug."}
{"text":"What a concept - build your own tacos.  And they are awesome including the quesos and salsas.  Plus some great beers on tap too.  This place is always busy but haven't had to wait more than 10 min for a table."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving Mexican food (shocker) and we have been wanting to try Condado, it was happy hour, and it was Friday... all signs pointed in the right direction! Our happy hour dreams were quickly shot down when we arrived to Condado and the hostess sat us upstairs (even though there were open seats down stairs). When I asked for the happy hour menu, our waiter informed us that we could not get happy hour upstairs. This was a bad start to our Mexican happy hour! Next time, I will make sure to tell the hostess we are there for happy hour.. hello 1/2 price margaritas!! 

I still ended up ordering the muddled jalapeno margarita. This margarita was just OK for me- nothing super special about it. Chris ordered a Modelo & we also started with the chorizo queso. This queso was the best part of the meal! It was amazing & the homemade tortilla chips were just as delicious. They also gave you a generous serving of the queso and brought out more chips as needed. 

I loved the idea of the create on your own tacos. I didn't know that Condado offered this and I was super excited to make my own! There are plenty of options from the meat, toppings, and shells. It made it hard to create! I had 2 tacos- the 1st was a hard shell with chicken and some different fillings (can't remember) and the 2nd was a soft shell with pulled pork, pineapple salsa and a habanero BBQ sauce. The meats were just OK and there was nothing super special about the shells. I did love the pineapple salsa though! 

The atmosphere inside Condado in my opinion was great! It would be a great place to come with a group of people for tacos and margaritas! Although the food isn't as amazing as some of the other taco spots in PGH, the prices were more wallet friendly."}
{"text":"Heard such good things about this place I couldn't wait to try it! Go in and wait to be served...and waited..and waited. Finally grabbed my stuff and got up and left! Service sucks!"}
{"text":"I want to TACO 'bout how awesome this place is.  If I was given one last meal - it would be Tacos - and it would be Condado's brisket tacos with the many unique and delicious toppings and sauces they offer. I am salivating right now just thinking about them.  I got hooked on this place after first being introduced to their Margaritas from a girlfriend of mine (BLOOD ORANGE IS TO DIE FOR) and their chips and dip (which is one of my favorite foods).  Eventually we tried their tacos and I can't believe it's taken so long for me to have them.  They're one of a kind with a wide variety of assorted toppings, sauces, and styles of taco shell.  They're a decent price, seem to be going more expensive since they've first started but you really do get a lot in one taco.  I'm typically full off of 1 and my fiance can't finish more than 2-3.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Only downside is that it does get quite busy and seating is very congested, I'm talking about rubbing elbows with whomever is seated next to you, hearing everyones conversation.  The upstairs is a bit more open, however that area is not always open.  With that being said I have had a few to go orders messed up and unfortunately you don't find out until you're home unwrapping the tacos and about to dive in.  I've worked in the service industry so I understand from time to time things like that will happen.  Love this place, haven't been able to find better tacos."}
{"text":"I would want to give this a 3.5 if it was an option. 

Cool build your own taco concept. 

My first taco was real good. Chorizo in a hard shell. Meat had great flavor and the shell tasted home made. 

The next 2 were chicken a soft shell. Chicken was very bland and nothing special about the shell. 

Side of rice was a tiny little serving for $1.  It was like the size of a golf ball. The rice was also not that good.  I was hoping for a cilantro lime type of rice. This was just white rice with very light seasoning...was expecting more. 

So all in all, food wasn't terrible just not great. 

I went during lunch on a Monday so I can't judge the atmosphere. They did a pretty good job remodeling prior restarting that was there but not a lot of people and music was very quiet so can't judge atmosphere or drink selection. 

I'll go back for sure one day and give it another try."}
{"text":"My experience seems to align with many of the other reviews that I read here--good food, poor service. Theres something for everyone including quite a few vegetarian taco options. There's the option to create your own tacos (many many options!) and a menu of pre-designed tacos for the indecisive people like me!  We had a group of 8 so we tried 3 different guacamole styles (regular, pineapple, and salmon) and the corn salsa, all were great and the chips were delicious. Good prices. In terms of service, our waitress brought out a plain guac instead of a pineapple guac and when we told her about it she made a face and pulled it off the table without saying a word. This is just one example where we felt we were inconveniencing the staff instead of them simply apologizing and correcting the mistake--this can really make or break a place. I was hoping our experience was just an isolated one but it seems that its fairly common here. I will probably go back because the food is good but the customer service needs to be addressed!"}
{"text":"As a first timer at Condado Tacos, I had a very positive experience. My boyfriend and I went during happy hour on Friday night and were very pleased with the specials. The service was excellent. Tori was our server and she was very enthusiastic and attentive during the whole visit. The food was excellent as well. We both ordered chicken tacos and they came out hot and were just as we ordered. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Get a taco, any taco, with brisket.

Really that's all you need to know. You can come in and order their pre-made tacos or build your own. I built one of mine with brisket, then two more with pulled pork. The brisket was definitely the wiser choice.

It was prime time on a Friday night so the place was pretty packed, but we really only waited 10 minutes or so for four of us.

Great introduction to Pittsburgh for me."}
{"text":"So fun eating here! Great waiters and great drink selection.  I've had a lot of authentic southwest tacos and these are right up there in quality!"}
{"text":"I went to try it out on a tuesday night.  Sat at the bar, Mike the bartender served me and explained the menu.  Tons of options and customization for your tacos and sides.  the food style is more americanized or Tex-Mex than traditional mexican, tons of options, great pricing, really good service, will be back."}
{"text":"I didn't really get why people like this place. The waitress was frazzled and slow. The food was nothing special and the menu was confusing to me.  I don't want to have to think that hard when I want to relax and enjoy lunch or happy hour.  They should have more easy choices. I\"ve gone twice and have not been impressed either time. There's another mexican restaurant around the corner from this one that's much better."}
{"text":"We come on a Friday, 1/2 hour before happy hour and wouldn't have gotten a table if we hadn't. Make your own tacos is awesome (ask for soft corn if that's what you want), margaritas great and our server did an excellent job checking in (and getting us to buy that one more margarita at happy hour). Don't expect to carry on a conversation without yelling- very loud venue!"}
{"text":"I was certain nobody could beat Bakersfield's guacamole, but it's happened. As someone who is searching for the city's best guacamole, I'm comfortable saying I've found it. 

The service is hit or miss. The tacos are very good and many build your own combinations. A glass of modelo with a lime makes my world go round. Check this place out and ask to sit upstairs if you think the ground floor is too packed.

** Updated May 2018

I'm removing two stars due to the service consistently being awful. I no longer frequent Condado like I once did. I'm back at Bakersfield slamming back the PBRs and guacamole. It's disappointing that they cannot seem to get it together at Condado, the food is yum but the rest of the experience is lackluster at best."}
{"text":"Went here for some birthday tacos after a pirates game and it was great. I loved the way you order the food. It makes it so customizable and easy. I went with my boyfriend and some friends and everyone was happy. I love more creative and authentic food, while my boyfriend is strictly ground beer, sour cream, and lettuce kinda guy. We both got some great tacos and left very happy. 

The one and only downfall was that one of my tacos included an ingredient I didn't recognize and it turned out to be made with VERY HOT habanero peppers. The server apologized and said that the most recent batch was MUCH spicier than usual and that's not how it typically is. 

The manager that was working came over and chatted with us about everything and really sealed the deal on a wonderful experience. Will definitely return to this place the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Fun and friendly taco restaurant Downtown.  So many options for customizing orders, can be overwhelming.  Honestly, you can't make a bad choice!   Highly recommend the flight of Margaritas!!"}
{"text":"This is a make your own tacos place, that also offers some pre-made tacos. 

Me and my friends ordered some nachos and two or three tacos each, which ended up being more than enough. If you're only getting tacos I think two or three are fine, based on how hungry you are. They're pretty big and filling.

Nachos were nothing special. We had quite a lot left over but didn't box. We mostly just ate the free chips that they gave us, which were good. The tacos were also fine, but again nothing special. It kind of felt like they were going for the authentic but hip vibe with some of their ingredients, and it just didn't end up impressing me. None of the individual ingredients (and I tried to get a variety) were amazing. Just didn't live up to other tacos I've had, growing up in California.

All that being said, I see the appeal for make your own tacos and nice drinks in a hip environment at a reasonable price point. Also the murals, art, and service were all awesome!"}
{"text":"Fun tacos greatly equipped for vegan and vegetarian options. Build your own! Cheap cheap cheap. Full from $6. Can't beat that. Also.. the wait staff is incredibly attractive!"}
{"text":"Very good! We had chipsand sala, 4 build your own tacos, tofu bowl, and hubby had 2 beers. Food was good and the bill was just $21."}
{"text":"I knew that this place was opening soon and luckily we were downtown this weekend to check it out. Official opening: Tuesday, March 14.  The inside is super hip with skull graffiti on the walls and cool people working there.  This was a pre opening day, so they were working some kinks (i.e. app came before our pitcher of margaritas) out but that did not take away from the great food and service. Many managers checked on us throughout our meal to make sure that we had a memorable experience. 

Some things to Note:
The margaritas are tasty.  Not that sugar mix garbage that you get at other places.  This pitcher tasted like it was handcrafted with just enough sours and more than enough alcohol,  A plus for authenticity. 
The tacos are tasty.  Interesting flavors, spicy, not spicy.  Anything that you want, you can get. there are no menus there.  More than the flavor, these bad boys are filling.  After eating an endless bowl of chips, two tacos was almost too much
NO MENUS (sort of):  You have a tablet of pre-made tacos and a tablet of make your own.  There are a lot - ALOT of options.  It isn't blatantly stated, but you can add proteins to pre-designed tacos.  I have a \"Trust the chef\" mentality, so I usually stay away from anything build-your-own, butI did create a shrimp Seviche taco that really hit the spot."}
{"text":"Best tacos, chips, and guac I've ever had! They are a little pricey but always worth it as I never leave hungry. Their service is great - almost too great! The food comes out quite fast after ordering, so sometimes we'll be slow to order just so we can have more down time to enjoy our apps and conversation. One of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh. They also have a rewards program, so that's nice!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because of the affordability and service. The kitchen completely screwed up our orders but they brought out extra tacos to compensate so we were satisfied. There are far too many seats in this restaurant, it was extremely loud and cramped. But it was a Saturday night so I would suggest skipping Saturdays. I think this restaurant caters well to vegans and vegetarians. The queso fresco was so good! Heads up they only take reservations for large parties."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Tortilla chips were way too greasy. Asked for hot salsa and what we got was not only mild but also quite bland. Brisket Tacos were nothing special; had much tastier ones at another place around the corner.   It was their first week open so I may give it another shot... have heard some good things that don't match my experience."}
{"text":"I want to love Condado because I love tacos.... but it's just not worth your time, ESPECIALLY when there are three stellar taco spots within walking distance. This place does not have its shit together AT ALL. I've been here twice now and both times were pretty lackluster. The first time I came with a girlfriend for happy hour. It was decent - the food is mediocre, but during happy hour it's cheap and if the service was good, I probably would have enjoyed myself more.

The second time was a straight up disaster. I went back with a large party (10 or so), also for happy hour. I don't know if they just weren't equipped to handle us or what, but from beginning to end the service was so bad. The only way to describe our server is erratic. We had issues with who ordered what, to go boxes, food prices (all on one bill to make it easier on him), a lost credit card... it was such an nightmare. As the night went on you could tell he just wanted us to leave. He cleared a nearly full margarita away from a co-worker just to get us out of there :(

To be honest... the high point of the night was actually the food runners. They were the only ones who were fast, efficient, and seemingly interested in the customer having a good experience. If they switched places with our server our experience probably would have been much better.

If the food was amazing, I'd put up with all this for sure. But don't call yourself a \"gourmet\" taco spot if you're using store-bought tortillas and guac. The guac was so obviously not freshly made. It was basically store-bought pureed avocado with no flavor whatsoever.

I guess it's still new-ish but I'm not willing to see if they work the kinks out when there are so many other better taco spots with similar prices around town. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Giving Condado an additional star than I planned since I've been here once before and enjoyed it. I dined here for a quick snack and one last drink with friends before heading our separate ways. One friend and I split the Queso Elote. This was the only shared meal and now she and I have a shared sickness! I didn't want to spend my last night visiting the city going between the bed and the bathroom, but unfortunately the queso had other plans."}
{"text":"I have been back to Condado a few times since my first visit when they first opened and I just don't feel they are living up to their original standard they set last year for me.

While their food, in my opinion, is still good and their combinations creative/endless, my issue stands with their service.  If I were rating based on service and the interaction I've had with employees alone, I'd give 2 stars and even that is being generous.

I've been here 3-4 times with reservations and it's never been a simple process. I would think with such a large upstairs space and the fact that they promote brunch so heavily on the weekends, that they would expect the crowd that comes and not act like they're trying to keep their head above water taking care of customers.  During any visit I've made recently, there were issues with the reservation not being communicated/tables not being set up, the service being slow/confusing/clustered or our food not coming out correctly.  These are all relatively minor things to be resolved, but creates an irritating experience when they happen, especially on a repeated basis. The employees seem to be there more to interact with each other and socialize than to actually do their job. 

This past weekend we had a large party for my birthday and while our waitress was doing the best she could, they set us up in this most misconstrued configuration of 3 tables all facing different direction and we had one person taking care of all of us ON TOP of her other tables upstairs.  This caused a lot of confusion both for her and us and probably would have been helpful to have more hands on deck.  Not to mention not one person at my table felt they actually received what they ordered, but that's not the waitress' fault.

Overall I love the idea and the atmosphere (and the margs) at Condado, but there are definitely areas that need work.  Seems fun & great for a group of people, but ends up being more frustrating and inconvenient, in my experience, once it's all said and done."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite taco spot! I tried the \"Surf 'n Turf\", \"El Santo\" and the \"Chronic Tortillas Fritos\". I really loved the \"sweet Lucy shell\" which is essentially a hard taco shell wrapped in a soft shell. The steak nachos were also amazing and could basically be a meal if you're not insanely hungry. Everything was cooked very well and the combination of flavors on my tacos was incredibly unique and unlike I've had anywhere else. I had a Peach Margarita and (like the food) it was delicious. 

The decor is also very cool and Condado is in an accessible location downtown. I will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a week day. It was very busy during lunch but I was lucky to grab a seat at the bar. Their menu is quite interesting that allow you to chose quantity of the taco you want or build your own. There are not many suggested taco to chose from speak as a first time visiter. There are multiple vegan options as well which is pretty nice compare to a lot of place only offer one or two options for vegetarians. It is a little pricy for a workday lunch. It would definitely cost $10+ for lunch without tax and tips. The portion is bigger than a lot of taco offer in town. I ordered three tacos but full after 1 1/2. The mantis, surf'n turf and el santo were the ones I got. Love them all besides the surf'n turf because it was way too spicy! I wish the bartender would mention the host pepper is really included in the taco and it is very spicy. Had to stop after one bite. But one thing I like a lot about this place is they process things very fast. From the time that I turned in my order till they brought out my tacos, I would say 5-10 minutes? All their staff were very nice as well!"}
{"text":"I came here on an average weekday night after work and man, was this place popping & filled with people. Granted, it recently opened so I guess that certainly helps, but I certainly did not expect it to be so full! As such, I proceeded to order out as there was no way I was going to wait to be seated. There are two ways to order: 1) either presets on a menu or 2) make-your-own where you can customize different aspects of your taco with some ingredients costing extra. In general, the tacos here are pretty good and reasonably priced. They have some pretty interesting ingredients and combinations that can be made with such ingredients on the menu, which I personally found pretty intriguing and certainly not something you find at some of the other taco places that I've been to in the 'burgh. All in all, the tacos tasted great ... packed with flavor, freshly made, and reasonably priced. I certainly would recommend at least a try if you are into tacos of any kind. Oh and there's a bar too, if you're into that kind of thing as well, lol."}
{"text":"yaaassssss. i don't really have anything to say that hasn't already been said. but this is hands down my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh. (how many have i been to? like, two. but still.) come for some delicious tacos and then whenever you are sad in the future you can think about the great tacos that you had."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch on the way to a play and the experience was great. Had queso and chips, tacos and a flight of margaritas. I could totally sit in front of the tv and eat their queso and chips all night. The tacos were good but then menu was a bit overwhelming since you have to build it yourself. Lots of options so they had something for everyone but I keep my tacos simple so it was too long for me. The tacos and queso were different menus so that was a bit confusing as well. The flight of margaritas was outstanding. Great taste and good value. Had blackberry, mango and strawberry. Very good and the BlackBerry was my favorite. The service was fast and friendly. The location is a bit small but we didn't have to wait for a table. We are certainly going back for the food and drinks this is a very nice place."}
{"text":"Came here with my buddy after a highly disappointing wine and taco festival. 

It was at Condado where I found redemption.  

Now if you think you're gonna get some authentic Oaxacan tacos here, think again. They're just trying to bring good tacos for EVERYONE to enjoy in a festive atmosphere and they do a great job of it! I respect it. 

Versatile gringo style tacos (and some non gringo)! Have the option of selecting from their recommended tacos or creating your own. With a piece of paper and a pencil and a few X's (sorry didn't mean to sound like a divorce lawyer ad) you can construct your own tacos.  Nachos and other typical dishes are available too. The nachos do look heavenly, won't lie. It's one of the few places where you can \"double decker\" up with a tortilla and crispy shell. 

The meats are cooked well and the margaritas are strong AF yet extremely delicious. We got mango jalapeño and that hit the spot (by spot  I'm pretty sure it was a stomach ulcer but worth it )


Overall, dope little taco haunt at the location formerly known as \"tonic\" and a great addition to downtown. Awesome place to hit up before going out or for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Condado and go there quite often, the atmosphere, variety, and awesome drink selection definitely make it a go to for me! Although a few weeks back I went in with two of my younger female friends and they were a little confused by the menu, and the waitress (small blonde girl with glasses and wavy hair) was VISIBLY annoyed. I was the only one who had been there before, so every question asked was met with a very unfriendly and unenthusiastic tone- very unlike my previous experiences but definitely worth mentioning. I believe I've had this girl before and received proper service from her in the past, so I'll just chalk it up to a long day. Still, the food was fantastic and my friends said for that reason they'd return."}
{"text":"We ate lunch at Condado in Pittsburgh today. Everything way fresh and delicious and our server was outstanding. My (football player) son had the steak nachos and couldn't finish it. I had the surf and turf taco and loved it. Guacamole, corn salsa and chips were delicious. My mom ordered the cold pressed coffee and didn't like it, so our server took it off of the bill.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"While in Pittsburgh on business I decided to venture out for dinner and found this place. Who doesn't love tacos? The place was pretty packed so I ordered 3x chicken tacos to go with a side of black beans and rice. The tacos were delicious and the sides were a good portion side (not overwhelming). The price was great as well. If ever back this way will definitely try and come back!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my go-to happy hour spot in downtown.  This is a place that you can go to without breaking the bank.  The tacos can be as inexpensive and basic as you want or you can make them on the fancier side with more higher end toppings.  It is a lively restaurant that is holding its own in a fiercely competetive foodie part of town."}
{"text":"Take your Taco Cravings to Taco Bell and you will be more satisfied than coming here. Low quality ingredients=no taste. I ate this over an hour ago and I am still regretting the waste of calories I ingested."}
{"text":"Had a great time with work friends eating food too hottt for words.  Ghost pepper steak not a joke! It is was a great night!"}
{"text":"I ate here again and LOVED my tacos and guacamole. The chips could be better, maybe more salt. I like that it's build your own, I wish there were seafood options like crab, lobster and shrimp.

As much as I love these tacos I have to say if I eat more than two things I get sick..."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh seems to be getting a lot of hipster taco joints lately, and you know what?  I ain't mad about it.  The Mexican food scene around here is pretty weak because we don't have much of an immigrant population to speak of, so not a lot of options if you're like me and love going to a hole in the wall with someone's Abuela in the kitchen, you know?  And you know what?  I ain't really mad about that either.  I lived in SoCal for 8 years and had all that time to get my fill since my own Abuela went to see Jesus decades ago.  

Anyway, I am happy that tacos have taken on a life of their own outside of a cheesy Mexican restaurant chain context, much like pizza has.  Their MTO concept is a teensy bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's cool.  They even have some pre-made combos for you to choose from, which is what my friend got because she didn't trust her judgment to put together a good taco.  She says they were good, but pretty loaded and filling.  I myself went pretty simple, limiting myself to about 3 ingredients including the protein.  They were very good, but I was a little taken aback by the corn tacos being hard shell and not soft like the street tacos I'm used to.  It's not necessarily a bad thing, but something to take note of if you're not into hard shell.  A couple of my tacos were chicken, and the meat was very juicy and can make the shell soggy if you don't get to it quick enough, so heads up.  We also split an order of the guac and it had a nice little kick to it.   One thing to note is that the HH specials is just in the downstairs bar area.  If you want a table upstairs, you'll probably have to wait because the place isn't that big to begin with, and it draws a nice crowd if there's a game in town."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Chips, salsa, guacamole, queso, and TACOS are TO DIE FOR. I've heard their \"dirty sauce\" is legit one of the spiciest around and their drinks are strong, but I can't attest to that. I ordered hard shell tacos and boy was I salivating for more. I can't wait to bring my boyfriend here so he can go to taco heaven. I also really love the atmosphere: exposed brick, cool ass artwork everywhere, and industrial vibes with the dark wooden tables.

I made my own tacos but they also have suggested tacos for you to choose from."}
{"text":"Condado is hands down my favorite place to get tacos. The build your own menu offers a lot of unique and delicious choices. Along with that, the price is fantastic. The atmosphere is cool as well. Great customer service, great food, great drinks. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food and a load party like atmosphere... feels like Cinco d' Mayo every day!  The Tacos are bigger and more filling than you think... 2 will do!!!"}
{"text":"The place is a bit small, and you will be bumped quite a bit as people walk by during your meal. The service was good, but the tacos were served like you got them from a food truck (wrapped in aluminum foil). I don't mind that, but compared to other taco places nearby it doesn't really stand out as the better option. I tried it, but will more likely go to one of the other places nearby next time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite taco places in Pittsburgh. The best thing about Condado is that the tacos are made to order and you can pick every ingredient that goes in! The price is very reasonable and the tacos are larger than most! The only downfall is that you cannot make reservations unless you have a party greater than 12."}
{"text":"Fantastic, insanely fresh ingredients, terrific beverage selection, only reason I don't give 5 stars is because they make you build your own taco/burrito/bowl. As a former chef, for me, part of dining out is trying dishes the way the chef intended, with the flavor contrasts, textures, etc. if I wanted to make my own thing I would have stayed at home. I'm sure I'm in the minority in this way of thinking, but based on the commitment to fresh ingredients alone, I would seriously love to try a chef inspired dish there, maybe it exists, and I just didn't see it. Otherwise, this taco place is as DANK as it gets!!! Must try!"}
{"text":"Really loved the decor of the place and the artwork on the walls, combination of funny food related work and traditional Mexicano artwork. Two floors both with bars, kid friendly (they'll hold strollers at the front podium for you if you have young ones). Awesome concept of build your own tacos. Tried the shrimp ceviche, BBQ jackfruit (which is an awesome vegetarian option), and steak all of which were delicious protein options. Salsa verde was hot but delicious. Beer selection was small but good choices including some locals from PA and OH. Definitely would come back to try more combinations of different ingredient options!"}
{"text":"love this place. service could be a bit better but overall really great. great food awesome vibe."}
{"text":"Great fastish food with a fun atmosphere and reasonable prices. Excellent bar with a great selection! Crowded at lunch, and for good reason. The build-your-own tacos are to die for, with the combinations endless. Don't forget to snag a bowl of yummy guacamole and chips. 
Muy ricos!"}
{"text":"Condado is a great addition to what seems to be an ever-expanding taco scene in Pittsburgh. The biggest difference here from other joints is that you can completely customize your tacos. I highly recommend the Sweet Lucy from the taco shell selections! It is a soft shell, layered with cheese and then a hard shell inside...kind of like a gordita crunch for anyone that's a Taco Bell fan. The prices at Condado are also super reasonable. You only pay $3 per taco..unlike some other places in town that charge $6 or $7. They also have a great Happy Hour where tacos are $1 off!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! We always get the Tres Amigos salsa sampler. Highly recommend the dirty queso, blanco queso and the out this world corn salsa! All the tacos are delicious and you can even build your own. This place is great especially for vegetarians and vegans! Staff is friendly and tons of drinks to choose from as long as love tequila! Great date night spot or a place to get together with friends. Our waitress Sarah D was so nice! Food comes out quickly and just the way you wrote it down on the paper."}
{"text":"Hands down BEST tacos I've ever had in my life. I loved the concept, where you order your own food by using pen and paper. There are tons of options, especially for vegans and vegetarians. Drinks looked great, I ordered one but I think the server forgot to put it in. I ate so much chips and guacamole that I was kind of glad he forgot it! Wow! Check this place out."}
{"text":"This place was so good!! Since I started working downtown, I've been on the lookout for good vegan options and this was my favorite so far. I for the Thai chili tofu tacos with chips and guacamole. The tacos were delicious and everything was proportioned perfectly, so everything wasn't falling out, and I wasn't sifting through a mound of lettuce to find my tofu. The environment was also great. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Great tasting tacos with lots of options. I tried a margarita flight with three different flavors but they honestly all tasted the same and weren't very strong."}
{"text":"Went to check this out during their official opening night with a friend of mine. Will definitely be giving it another shot in the hope that they were just working out the kinks in the new location. 

To start, the downstairs packed a lot of tables in a small space, so I was constantly having to move my seat in to let the wait staff go by. I can deal with that, but after the 15th time or so, it did get old. 

The waitstaff was very nice here, but seemed like maybe they were overwhelmed. There were multiple occasions during the night where we were either brought the wrong item, or it was forgotten completely. 

The drinks were good (even though they were out of the muddled Jalapeño margarita I was hoping to try). Although another table and ourselves did notice that the wait staff doesn't ask if you want salt on the rim of the margarita you order, which is a bit odd. 

I enjoyed the appetizer trio they offered, as you could choose from a few varieties of salsa, queso, and guac. The chips they gave with it were very good, but about 75% of them were crumbs that were barely big enough to dip. Luckily the wait staff offered to replace the chips a couple times as they noticed it was mostly crumbs also. 

Now when it comes to tacos, I think my bar has been set pretty high by places in Pittsburgh like Bakersfield downtown, and Doce Taqueria in southside, so I was a little disappointed with the Tacos here. The tacos weren't bad by any means, but definitely not what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go on a whim. We were a little stupid for not realizing that would be super slam since it's Taco Tuesday! We were expecting a long wait for a table and then for food after we ordered. There were about 6 tables ahead of us and we only waited about 15 minutes. After we ordered everything came out quickly and was hot. Since it's the grand opening there were lots of specials on margaritas and your first Taco was free. I got a peach Margarita and my husband got prickly pear. Prickly pear kind of tastes like watermelon. They were both good. I was surprised that I liked their traditional Margarita more. My husband says that is has a punk-rock rock Taco vibe to it and I have to agree. 

I really love the build your own taco option. It's like Mad Libs only you end up with a delicious yummy dinner. We got the dirty dip and it was absolutely delicious. I queso dip with chicken beans onions, \"dirty sauce\" and a whole bunch of yum.

I called this the flavors of Tako and the value of Los Palmas. I wouldn't bring your grandmother cuz it's kind of loud but works in this place.

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is trying way too hard. Born and raised in LA, I know good Mexican, and this is far from it. The queso is very similar to that of Moe's at three times the cost. Gross. The beef brisket on my taco tasted like marshmallows??? The only redeeming qualities to this meal were the salsa verde and my pomegranate margarita. The decor is...very strange. Meme-y and kind of annoying. \"TACOS 4 LYFE!!!\"? Not these tacos. Won't be back for the food. Might be back for the margaritas. If you want good Mexican, walk around the block to Bakersfield."}
{"text":"Best. Tacos. Ever!! \"The mantis\" taco was literally the best taco that I have ever had and definitely one of the top 10 foods I have ever ate. The mantis is a vegetarian taco made with jackfruit, chihuahua cheese, and habenero/mango bbq. We also had the queso and a pitcher of the house margaritas.  Everything was delicious.  Hands down better than Bakersfield and tako."}
{"text":"We tried this place on Saturday afternoon. When we arrived it was already crowded. The first floor has about a dozen tables and a bar. The hostess took us upstairs where there was quite a bit more seating. 

We ordered the guacamole and chips to start as well as a margarita for the hubs and a sangria for me. The guac was a pretty large portion in comparison to many other places. And the chips were fresh which was a huge plus. The margarita was good, but the sangria was not my favorite.

We both ordered two tacos a piece. The hubs ordered from the suggested menu and I did the \"build your own\".  The tacos were large and very tasty! My first taco had the beef with standard toppings and my second taco had pulled pork with a pineapple salsa. They were both delicious.

Hubs tried one of the vegetarian tacos and he loved it. That's saying quite a lot since he is definitely a meat eater.

When we left the line waiting for a table was huge. We obviously beat the rush. This place has some obvious pluses and not many cons.

Pros:
Tasty tacos 
Good value in the guac
Fresh chips
Homemade salsas
Good prices 
Nice location 

Cons:
Sangria could use some work 
Drinks are a bit pricey 
Crowded place
The beans are way too salty- not good 

All in all we will definitely be back. But we will certainly do our best to hit them at a slow time."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place.  Their food is delicious, and you have the option to build your own tacos-which is super fun!  The happy hour specials they offer daily can't be beat!  During the summer months, we usually sit outside!"}
{"text":"Came here late night with some friends the server had an attitude the whole time and our food was ice cold. When she finally checked on us (after we were all done and not one water refill) we told her the food was cold and she became argumentative and said she would get the manager. The manager never showed up and they comped one persons bill. My other friend was over charged but she was over it so we didn't say anything. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Bartenders were super friendly and helpful in ordering.  I had a mango margarita, spicy queso, and 2 street tacos.   So good!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the experience here. The variety of tacos available is impressive and the quality is just as good. The margaritas are served in adorable mason jars and they have so many great flavors! Between my friend and I, we tried 4 different margs and I enjoyed each one (which isn't common). The staff was attentive and kind. 

I think the fact that impressed me the most, besides the variety, is that there are multiple vegetarian options that are actually tasty! It can be hard to find something other than refried beans as  a vegetarian option in Mexican restaurants, but Condado successfully does that. 

My only critiques are that the prices are rather steep for a college student, unless you come during happy hour, and that the wait is mighty long during that time. But with quality tacos and margs like this, I think that's warranted. I will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great margaritas. Being across from my hotel was dangerously convenient."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and the atmosphere went over lunch with a coworker and we were promptly seated although space was tight. 4/5 stars as I was hoping for more authentic street tacos vs Americanized.m but overall very impresse"}
{"text":"Solid spot!

Quick thoughts:

-Fair priced food/drinks. Happy hour prices are great. Will be back during HH. 

-Decor is cool. Lots of skullz. RIP tonic (will miss u).

-The music was oddly loud for lunch at noon on a Thursday. I felt like I was in da club.

-Tacos are generously sized compared to the two-bite Bakersfield tacos down the street; I built two brisket tacos which were pretty num.

-Queso + chips were good. A Generous amount of dip and waiter gave us extra chips.

-Margaritas are good. They use real fruit/lime juice.

-The menus are a bit confusing at first!

-All in all: 4 stars for above average food/drinks at super reasonable prices but docked a star bc nothing really stood out as OMGZ"}
{"text":"Great spot. Went for Sunday brunch. Margaritas were delicious as were the tacos. We had a wonderful server too. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos and margaritas in town. The nachos were delicious and the surf and turf taco was great. I loved the freshness of the ingredients. The muddled jalapeno margarita is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"inexpensive, delicious and quick service. The menu is simple so all tacos can be different and customizable. they have many vegetarian and vegan options and also gluten free."}
{"text":"Just had tacos at Condado and it was fine for me. The pluses are that I was seated right away, the space is cool, my server was helpful, and service was super quick. Where it fell short was I didn't love my tacos. I ordered the beef brisket and the shrimp ceviche and a side or rice. The rice looked like plain white rice and lacked flavor. The beef was rather chewy and the shrimp in the ceviche looked as if they were pre-cooked. I found this to be more American style tacos, which in and of itself, is not a terrible thing. But if you're looking for something more authentic, this is not your place."}
{"text":"Lots of vegan options, which is a rarity at some other places in this town.  Was sad to see Tonic go and skeptical when Condado moved in, but the atmosphere is laid back, the drinks are reasonably priced, the food is excellent and they haven't turned into an overpriced bro-stop for the after work crowd.  The only complaint is that the menu is a bit confusing when building your own tacos (if you are getting more than two and being very specific about what you want on each)."}
{"text":"Condado Tacos is amazing, hands down my favorite taco joint in Pittsburgh! I've been in for dinner twice now and loved it each time. The atmosphere is laid back and the servers are super cool and friendly! The salsas, queso, and guacamole are out of this world delicious and there's plenty of chips to go around! I love the build your own taco menu and there are plenty of choices for vegetarians, too (BBQ jackfruit whattttt!!). I think both visits I got pulled pork and roasted pollo with various toppings and everything was just so good! I'm already planning what I want next time, which I hope is really soon. Btw don't let the price of the tacos fool you, they are really filling; both times I took my second taco to go! 
Last but not least, the margs. Man oh man do I love margaritas and Condado hits the spot! The house is $6 and to have a flavored one is an extra $1, I'd recommend the blood orange or the prickly pear! Yum! Happy hour during the week has a half off marg special as well, I mean you cannot beat that!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Condado with some friends.  Overall, we really enjoyed the experience.  The tacos are fresh and flavorful and they have a great selection of beers, tequila, etc.  The various dips offered for the chips were also very good and diverse.  My wife is Gluten Free and they were easily able to accommodate her needs.

Although they have many types of tacos (both pre-suggested combinations and build your own (kind of like Burgatory)), that is where the menu ends.  Tacos.  Nothing else.

In addition, the restaurant was packed and there was a 30 minute late.

Finally, beware that it is a young crowd.  We are in our early to mid-50s and we were old enough to be the parents of just about everyone in the place - patrons and employees.  It did not make a difference in the food, service, etc., but just letting readers know so that they know what to expect."}
{"text":"They have a build your own taco menu! There is a long list of options to choose from! Including a variety of tortillas (sweet lucy was tasty with chicken!), sauces, and toppings! The brisket was really good! Great price, about $3-4/taco. Extensive margarita and drink menu. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love trying new taco places, but was honestly a little disappointed with this one. Condado has strong margaritas and a pretty decent draft list. I found the concept refreshing, but the execution a little flawed. Condado is a make your own taco joint, but also has a set list of menu tacos. They have several protein options, and  many vegetarian options, which is a plus. However, their set taco menu does not utilize each of the proteins. Meaning, the set menu has few options and it doesn't have one option for each of the proteins. The menu was a little confusing, but I liked that they had so many taco shell options. Additionally, the guacamole was very good. I only gave it three stars because I generally prefer street tacos and traditional tacos to the ones at condado. Worth a visit once, but not more than that."}
{"text":"Condado is okay, but it's trying really hard to be Tako. 

We were there at about 8pm last night and it was super loud and clubby, which okay, that's their vibe, but it was a Wednesday night at 8pm.  It's just a hugely jarring change from Tonic, the establishment in the same location before.  It was also very dark, which made it really hard to read the menus that are printed in teeny tiny font.  

My husband and I have three advanced degrees between us and we genuinely couldn't figure out how to order the tacos - it's one of those papers where you check the things you want, but it's really unclear how it works and how you order - go online and look at their menu and you'll see what I mean.  I couldn't even figure out where the nachos were  (under \"tortillas,\" listed as \"tortillas fritas\" in like 4 point font - not the first place I'd look to find nachos).  

The tacos came and they were good.  Not fantastic but solid.  The nachos came and were *so incredibly annoying.*  It was enough nachos to fill a big platter, as nachos are typically served, but they were piled 8 inches high into a tiny little basket.  Picking up just one made a huge mess, and about 10 nachos in, we just gave up because food was going everywhere.  

On the positive side, the staff were very friendly and the decor (think many, many skulls) is pretty cool.  More tacos in my mouth is always a good thing, but I think Bakersfield, about 100 feet away, is a more solid choice."}
{"text":"I really love the idea of another taco spot in downtown, but Condado is lacking in many areas, namely service in comparison to La Palapa(food buggy), Bea's, Tako and Bakersfield. All of these places are worth going to ahead of Condado.

I booked reservations a few weeks ago for a group of 12 work colleagues. I asked about Happy Hour specials, and the lady working mentioned that they typically don't honor Happy Hour prices upstairs, but for this large of a group they'd be able to. When we got seated at our table, our waiter would not honor Happy Hour prices until the manager approved. Note: Happy Hour specials are apparently only honored in the downstairs bar, not upstairs for a traditional visit.

We ordered an abundance of food such as chorizo queso, traditional guacamole, and pineapple salsa to start. Our waiter, was pretty awkward and unable to take simple requests, most of the night. At one point, I literally had to take my 1/3 full margarita out of his hands because he took it from the table. His goal was to get us out of there as quick as possible. We ordered a good amount of tacos, and they were pretty average. Nothing stood out to me, but several folks mentioned they were worse tasting than the first time they ate here.

Lastly, when we got our check (all on one bill), the prices were wrong several times. When I go out to eat at an establishment, I want to be in a peaceful mentality, and enjoy my experience. My experience at Condado would've been better if I threw on a Condado tee and served my own table.

Needless to say, we won't be back any time soon!"}
{"text":"Best price for great tacos in town. Their queso and drinks are also great. The happy hour specials include $ off tacos and margaritas."}
{"text":"I still remember the feel I had when I took my first bite two days ago. It was so good. I remember it because I have had it for the past three days at lunch. Tacos are only $3. Everyone is nice. I was glad to be served by Becky at the bar, she was on her game and really frickin nice, and has some wickedly cool tattoos. The other times it did take a bit of time to get served, but they don't have a lot of severs, so catch one when you can."}
{"text":"I heard so many great things about this place and I really wanted to like it but unfortunately, I hated this place. I mean c'mon Condado, you had ONE job. You serve one type of food so the tacos should be at least decent! 

The menu was a little overwhelming and confusing. Once I tasted the tacos, saying I was disappointed would be an understatement. It was probably one of the worst tacos I've had. It was so bland and literally tasted like cardboard. I got a side of rice for 1$ which was also really bad and I don't really know how anyone could mess up rice. After a couple bites, the tacos made me a little nauseous, not really sure why. 

In addition to the bad food, the space was really small and not comfortable at all. 

I guess the only good thing I can say about this place is that the waitress was nice! 

DO BETTER Condado."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! I love a restaurant that can deliver not only in the kitchen, but on the atmosphere/scene as well! For starters we ordered salsa verde, salsa roja and chorizo queso. I was a big fan of the salsa roja and chorizo queso! I was debating on whether I build my own taco or order one of their creations off the menu. The build your own menu has a lot of options to pick from! I decided to build my own with the following: flour tortilla, pulled pork, pickled red onions, queso fresco and mexican chimichurri. I will say the pickled red onions and mexican chimichurri were game changers in the build your own taco challenge. The flavors really mixed nicely together with the pulled pork. I will also say that I was a little disappointed with the pulled pork to taco shell ratio. I felt like there was a lot of taco shell and not enough meat compared to what my other friends had in theirs. You really can't beat the price though! $3 for a pretty decent sized taco shell, compared to others I have had in town that are smaller and more money. I really cannot wait to come back and try one of their creations and devour more queso and salsa roja! If you love tacos and love options, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Condado is probably might favorite place to get tacos in Pittsburgh. You can either order one of Condado's recipes or create one of your own. These aren't necessarily authentic, Mexican tacos, but they are delicious. The queso, guac and salsa are all good as well. The beer menu also features a good selection of craft beers. On top of the food, the restaurant has a fun and quirky feel. It's a great place for a casual outing."}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour last night with a friend. She had been here before and raved about it. 

We got here a little early, around 5, and it's a good thing we did - we were able to get a seat at the bar but within 15 minutes they were packed! In order to get the happy hour deals you have to sit downstairs. So if you want a seat, plan accordingly. 

We ordered their trio of dips as an appetizer and margaritas. We got their red salsa, this amazing quest with peppers in it, and their honey chipotle pineapple guacamole. I love that they had some different twists on classics (like pineapple in guacamole). All three were awesome, and came with large portions. 

I did the build your own tacos. I got mine \"sweet Lucy\" style, which is a soft taco wrapped around a hard taco, smothered in quest and guacamole. I loved the combination of flavors and textures! I also loved the plentiful vegetarian options - they had three veggie proteins! I tried the Thai chili tofu and it was awesome. Very flavorful. The tacos are big - I ordered two and has trouble finishing after the dips. 

The margaritas were also tasty, and we had good service. Since we are during happy hour, we also got an amazing deal! Between the two of us we ordered the trio of dips with chips, four tacos, and four margaritas - and it came in around $45. For all that quality food! I was impressed, and I will be back."}
{"text":"I have been here once and both my tacos AND the margarita were the best I've ever had. I went to Tako the next day and it was nothing compared to Condado! The option for a soft, semi soft, and crunchy shell taco was awesome. There are so many varieties of tacos that you can make!! I'm a fan. Would eat here every day if i could."}
{"text":"Even though they don't usually take reservations for groups smaller than 12, they made an exception for our dinner group of 6, and we were seated right away on a busy Sunday evening. 

For $3 a taco, Condado offers a fantastic bang for your buck. These were some of the best tacos I've had in Pittsburgh! Lots of vegetarian options too - solidly beats Smoke and Bakersfield in this aspect. Highly recommend the double taco - a hard taco wrapped in a soft taco, so you get the crunch without it falling apart in your hands :) the chili tofu and cilantro sauce were great as well. They also serve yummy chips with guac and queso (though I must admit to liking the thicker queso at Bakersfield t). 

Condado has a loud, vibrant atmosphere - don't go here for a quiet meal, but you'll fit right in if you want to be a noisy group."}
{"text":"Went with a big group on a busy Friday and were seated upstairs. Even though the place was packed and we had multiple checks, our server was attentive and all the food came out together. We had a couple dips to share and I was a little disappointed with the queso. Not as flavorful as the name diablo queso would lead you to believe. The pineapple guacamole was surprisingly good. We all did the make your own tacos. I would highly recommend the ju-ju or goody goody taco shells - their homemade chorizo is tasty and not too greasy. The only problem with build your own is that I have a tendency to put too many toppings on and then can't taste the individual flavors. But it is nice to be able to pick cheese, salsas, sauces without being charged extra. The flavored margaritas were okay - reasonably priced but very sweet. Next time I'll try the regular margarita. They also didn't put salt on the rim but it could've been because they were busy. Much better prices than Tako and the food is delicious - can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a year but never had the chance to. Every time I tried to go, plans always changed. However, last night was my birthday and was determinedly make my first visit. 

When we arrived, the hostess asked if we wanted a table or to sit at the bar, which we like to do. She informed us that there was another bar upstairs. When we went upstairs, the bartender informed us the upstairs bar would be closing soon. I looked around, saw full tables and an almost full bar and said to my girlfriend, \"why would you say that to customers\". Regardless we went back downstairs and decided to wait for a table. 

We overheard the hostess tell the group in front of us that their food supply delivery truck was in an accident and they were out of a lot of key ingredients. I asked the hostess to confirm what I had overheard, but decided to be seated since we were already there. I figured we could a least have a drink and discuss plan b. 

Once seated, the server (wish I saved receipt so I could use her name) quickly approached us and asked what we would like to drink. I had my heart set on a Kahlo, but she informed me they were out of mint. At this point I ordered a go to Beer and then asked if they had the stuff to make the Tuscan guacamole, which was another item I had planned on ordering when previewing their menu the prior day. She informed me they were missing the top cheese for the item but could do the pineapple guacamole. We order that and I discussed with my girlfriend having the guacamole, finishing our drinks and going somewhere else because I didn't want my first time there to be marred with something out of their control. 

The guacamole came out almost instantly and it was very good. I asked the server what ingredients they were out of and she \"x'd\" and marked things on both the build your own and regular menus. She knew exactly what was what and was able to answer all my questions. I looked at it and discussed with my girlfriend that we can make this work, let's just stay here. 

We both built our own tacos they way we would've wanted them and put our order in when our server refilled out 1/2 empty tortilla chip basket without us even asking ++++. 

The tacos came out fast, almost to fast, that I'd advise anyone to wait until the moment you are actually ready to eat before ordering. Haha

The room was a little tight but our food and drinks (we had a couple specialty margaritas as well) were great. However our server was phenomenal! She made what could've been an unpleasant experience for a late night birthday dinner (when other restaurants were closing limiting plan b options) one that I am taking the time to write about this morning. 

In this day of saturated dining options, Condado Tacos stands among some of the top in the taco/Mexican restaurant explosion in Pittsburgh. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"favorite taco place. ever. 10/10. love the atmosphere. fast service. great tacos. favorite stop in pittsburgh."}
{"text":"As a person who has checked out all the cheap taco joints in PGH, this one is my new #1. Only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars was our server forgot our appetizer after reminding her twice, and brought it out after both of us had finished our meals. But will definitely come back again! Was amazing food at an amazing price in a great location!! Love the eyeball lights!!"}
{"text":"The hostess was nice the bartenders ok... the place looked a bit dirty and not many places to sit.. the food... overly cilantroed way too spicy I got supposedly bbq jackfruit which I wouldn't expect to be spicey and the supposedly the least spicey SOUR CREAM omg after a few bites I got the worst heartburn and 24 hrs later still have heart burn and acid reflux.. the side of rice had way way way too much black pepper and cilantro my finances bacon beans were loaded with pepper.. if you are over loading stuff with pepper and cilantro you are trying to cover for something.. never going back honestly and I hate to say it but I'd rather of home to chipotle.i love Jack fruit but I am not risking the pain of immediate and morning heart burn for this place again.. you got 3 stars for ok service but talk to your chef!!!"}
{"text":"First visit to Condado Tacos was a relatively good one. We walked in and immediately heard how loud it was and requested to sit outside. Outside tables were clean and comfortable. Our waiter did seem to forget us for a few minutes while we were waiting to place our order, but we understood as it was a busy Friday night. Food wise, we ordered queso blanco as an appetizer that was delicious. The chicken is fantastic. Lots of choices for building tacos that it's almost hard to choose! Friendly staff, good food, great downtown location."}
{"text":"Service is top notch! We came here for happy hour and to celebrate a friend's birthday. The staff was extremely nice and accommodating. They helped us hide the cake and even served it when the time was right. This place gets extremely crowded during happy hour so people were bumping against us the whole time. The food was pretty decent. We got a couple of dips to sample and my favorite one was the corn. The tacos were good and I like the concept that you can build your own. The only thing that disappointed me was that they didn't have a non spicy steak taco. Definitely try the margaritas!! Salud!"}
{"text":"Just made it here for the first time and was very impressed.  The decor inside is fitting with their theme, but the overall modern layout of Tonic is still there which I like.  The service was great and our server took a lot of time to explain all of the options and some of his favorites with us.

We had the queso blanco and salsa verde to start.  The queso might be the best I have ever had.  It was a perfect level of thickness and had a great cheesy taste.  The salsa was also very good.  It wasn't runny like many salsas can be.  The chips they use are house made and you can definitely notice a difference.

I had two soft shell flour tacos as my meal.  My first was the house made chorizo with cheddar and Mexican chimichurri.  The flavor of the chimichurri was great and went perfect with the chorizo.  My second taco was the chicken with chipotle crema.  The chipotle sauce had a perfect amount of spice to it.  

Overall I couldn't have been happier with the food here.  You can tell everything is fresh and house made which really makes a difference.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"5 stars if i wasn't from California.  But I am, so while these are good tacos, they're pretty Caucasian.   Their tacos are good, their guac was good, I paid extra for their ghost salsa which is just a little more spicy than the mild I'm used to at home.  I ate here almost every night when I was in town.  They have good drinks, I like the atmosphere, and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"It's hard to give 5 stars because Bakersfield is right around the corner. They have flights of margaritas which was awesome! The food was delicious. It just wasn't as good as Bakersfield. Prices were comparable."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and both meals were great! VERY reasonably priced! You can easily get lunch for around $10.

This place seems to have gotten very popular very quickly, so I'd suggest getting in before the lunch or dinner rush. The downstairs dining room is a little overwhelming when it's crowded because the tables are quite close together and it's very loud. There is not much room for the staff or customers to walk through when it's packed. This would not turn me off but I know it would for some people.

I love the menu. They have a menu of suggested tacos and then a \"Build-your-own\" option where you select your shell, protein, toppings, sauce, etc. My favorite shell is the Sweet Lucy which is a hard shell in a soft shell with queso and quac in between. You can't get much better than that. I absolutely loved the combo of the brisket with the jicama & cabbage slaw and pickled onions. We also got an order of queso to split for the table and I'll have to order that every single time I go in. Their chips are amazing! Pair all that with an original margarita on the rocks with salt and I'm a happy camper! I'll be going back here very soon."}
{"text":"Vegan/vegetarian options were amazing compared to going to just any ordinary restaurant! I tried both the Thai chili tofu and the BBQ jackfruit, both were really good but I preferred the tofu one. Guac was super yummy but I did find the chips to be a bit too salty imo, also weirdly enough the tacos came out cold, but the flavors were amazing, service was great, and atmosphere was super fun."}
{"text":"I'd heard that the Condado tacos were amazing, so I was only a little disappointed when I realized that their existence meant the very first restaurant I went to in Pittsburgh had disappeared (The Tonic Bar and Grill).

And the verdict that I reluctantly came to were that although the chips and salsas were exceptional, the tacos were not. After stuffing my face with chips and gushing about how they were the best I had - were they double fried? when the tacos came, I excitedly opened up the foil because well, tacos have a special place in my heart.  

My first bite made me wonder if somewhere between drowning my margarita I had accidentally ordered a frozen taco. I tried to get over it and explore the unique flavors that I knew were there but it was extremely difficult to get past the initial disappointment.

However, their chips and salsa were satisfying, the margaritas pretty good, and the place has an artsy, edgy vibe - so all in all, a place worth hitting for happy hour, maybe not so much for a full course dinner."}
{"text":"I have dined in and gotten takeout from here. Great tacos, staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Okay, I know this probably seems like a recurring theme...but please apply the caveat \"I got steadily drunker as the evening progressed\" to the tail end of the review.

Okay...

5 stars on the accomodating staff.  Friendly.  Flexible.  We started with a group of 6...wait...sorry 8...wait...sorry...10 people for a friend's birthday party and the staff just kept finding ways to get us seating.  It is NOT their fault that the seating we ended up with was apparently a repurposed shoebox in the ass end of the top floor of the restaurant.  That was not on them.  I don't know what that space normally does...but it did hold 10.  And the restaurant was steadily busy all night.  So full marks there.

We started out the evening on the ground floor.  We ordered drinks from the menu.  They were good.  I don't...I don't REALLY remember what they were.  I'll look them up.  Bear with me.

RIGHT!  Okay...I got the Delicioso.  House Margarita, muddled jalapeno & cucumber + splash 
of soda...right up my alley.  It was really good.  I probably would have ordered another one later except I thought it would be smarter to order a pitcher instead.  Related note...it is almost impossible for a single father of a younger daughter to order the Delicioso without doing so using an impression of Backpack from Dora the Explorer.

The pitcher I got was the Kahlo - Hornitos Reposado, club soda, fresh lime juice, fresh mint.  I should take a minute here to acknowledge that written underneath the margarita menu (in too small a font, if we're being fair) was, \"Keep in mind, silver tequila (used in many of our signature cocktails and margaritas) can sneak up on you. The smooth 
flavor doesn't taste like alcohol, but we assure you, it's in there!\"

Heed this.  

The drinks were great.  Let's give them another five stars.

The speed with which our order was taken was a downer.  I'd rank it pretty low, honestly, but they were so good about moving us around, and also...I had a pitcher of alcohol...so I wasn't really THAT irritated by it, but if I'd have been sober longer I might have been.  They were busy.  We were a big...seemingly nomadic table...so I have to give them a pass.  I'll rate that 3 stars.

I've sampled most of the elevated taco joints in Pittsburgh, so I was excited to try out theirs.  They have either a build your own menu, or a few signature styles.  I was surprised how many vegan/vegetarian options there were.  I think one of the three I got was vegetarian.  I was...I was quite drunk when the food arrived.  

BUT...BUT...they were goooooood.  And that's not the tequila talking.  After my first taco, the girl across the table from me said she couldn't finish hers and passed it across and that one was even better than the one I'd ordered.  

The Mantis:  Sweet Lucy shell, jackfruit, onions, tomato, Chihuahua cheese, and mango habañero sauce.
Honestly ordered it because I wanted to say \"jackfruit\" over and over.  
What?  I was drunk.

George's Dirty Taco:  Flour soft shell, queso blanco, rice, black beans, onions and dirty sauce
This one just made me laugh.  I was eating George's dirty taco.  And laughing.  Because I'm twelve.  And I was drunk.

Surf 'n' Turf:  Flour soft shell, queso fresco, rice, ghost pepper steak, 
shrimp ceviche, lettuce, onions, roja salsa, &  dirty sauce
This one sounded the best to me, and I honestly don't remember whether I even ate it. I think I did though.  And it was hot.  I poured myself another drink from the pitcher.

All in all I have no idea which tacos I ate and didn't eat.  And I think the fact that I put my name on the order slip (they give you pencils and taco order forms at the table) as Rico Caliente probably contributed to the chaos that forced one of our party to just pay for the entire night on his credit card.  And I guess...I guess arms raised in victory and shouting \"WOOHOO!\" was not the correct reaction to this because everyone else seemed to be saying things like, \"Oh my god, no, you can't possibly\" and \"It's too much\" and stuff like that and frankly I was just happy to still have enough money to go to the next place, and also I was drunk.

So...I will DEFINITELY be back.  Something I didn't mention was the decor.  I loved it.  Lots of contrasting sugar skull-esque sorts of murals.  It was a fun vibe.  GREAT happy hour locale.  Really good food.  I'll...fine tune my food review in at some future date."}
{"text":"This is a tough one to put my finger on. I am actually torn between 3 and 4 stars. 
The tacos are very good, and decent size for the price. The beer and liquor menus are very impressive and not too expensive. I like the atmosphere, it's 'hip' but not pretentious. However, what's lacking here is the service and management. At times it feels as though you are inconveniencing the staff. 
\"Excuse me, I hate to bother you, but could I place a food order?\" 
Also, they have an upstairs area with plenty of seating and a nice bar, which rarely seems open. They'd rather have the downstairs be cramped and uncomfortable, then let their patrons decide which type of atmosphere they would prefer.
When it's not super packed I would say come here, but if you prefer some space and better service, go around the corner to Bakersfield.
Too many good choices on the 900 block, to let service be an issue."}
{"text":"I really loved the drinks and queso when I went here, and the atmosphere was great. It was the perfect place to come on a Friday night. For those with a low spice tolerance, beware that some of the taco options are pretty spicy though!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were awesome at Condado! And if I were giving a rating only about their food and drinks, I would give them 5 stars with no hesitation. BUT I have never in my life experienced service as bad as I had at this restaurant.

Awhile back, a group of friends and I had reservations for a special occasion. Out of 11 of us, only one member of our group had been to Condado. When the waitress greeted us at our table, she asked if any of us had been there before and the one member raised their hand. The waitress said \"Okay, well if you've been here then you can explain how this works and make my life easier\" and then left for 20 minutes. There were a bunch of other issues throughout the evening (including her taking a glass of water that one person had been drinking out of and giving it to another person instead of just getting them a new glass). Finally, the week after, I checked my bank statement to see that they had overcharged me as well as several other members of our group. What was supposed to be a nice \"pick-me-up\" for a friend ended up being so disappointing."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. I waked in after then Penguins game to grab a few of the specialty pints and maybe a bite to eat. I sat at the bar and wasn't even looked at during the 15 minutes I was there. The place was not very busy and the bar tender seemed overwhelmed. I even tried to say \"excuse me\" to get his attention right in front of me and he kept on moving. I would love to try some of the beers on tap and what looks to be good food but that would require having a competent staff. Definitely a disappointment."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I went here for the first time and was blown away with their taco options. I had their Juicy Lucy and that was the best taco I had in my life. I will be returning soon!!"}
{"text":"It seems like DIY food is in right now, from burgers to pizza to burritos (as exmplified by Chipotle), so why not tacos? You choose everything from the shell to the meats to the veggies and cheese, so you can be sure to fully enjoy what you get. Or if you're not creative like me, you can just go with some of the suggestions, most of which sound pretty innovative already. They have both corn and flour shells, and various creative combinations of combining them. Lots of interesting vegetarian options for proteins as well, such as jicama and jackfruit, and a large number of different sauces to choose from. I chose to sample four different suggested tacos with a variety of ingredients, and each one was bursting with different flavors from sweet to spicy to savory. They were definitely filled with toppings, since finishing all four was a bit of a struggle. The only thing I would be wary of is that they tend to splurge on the sauces--some of them were dripping as I ate them. I would ask for them to go a bit lighter next time, or try to build my own to control that a bit better. 

Their salsas are also worth mentioning--really fresh and a great appetizer to share around the table."}
{"text":"Margaritas were awesome and tacos were pretty tasty.  Note to self... order 2 next time and if you are still hungry order a 3rd."}
{"text":"Food is great and the service could not be more accommodating.  We went with a big group and lots of different requests and the service was just great!  Excellent vegan and vegetarian options. Only problem, the place gets very noisy with lots of people there. Probably not a great choice for big group."}
{"text":"I went here with a new group of friends I met in Pittsburgh, and the food fueled us to have a great time. Condado Tacos has tacos already set with their combo of ingredients, but they also have the option to make your own. I went with the Dutch dragon, which had spicy portabella mushroom, cabbage, and the regular fixings like salsa and corn. The special thing about this restaurant's tacos is that they have a hard shell that's wrapped in a soft shell, held together by guacamole. I've never seen anything like this. You get two different textures with just one bite. It's truly a revolutionary idea. If you want to try something other than a taco, they also have a purple haze bowl. This bowl had tofu, red cabbage, and pickled onions. The pickled onions were a very nice touch and added depth to the dish. I would definitely go back to Condado Tacos to satisfy my taco cravings."}
{"text":"A great place that gets over looked because of all the talk over other taKo places in town! But this is by far my favorite!! The margarita needs work so opt for beer, but the food and guacamole won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Really awesome inside decor! Definitely a punk/rock vibe which hasn't been done at a Mexican place in Pittsburgh yet. We sat at the downstairs bar. Menu was super impressive. There's a smaller list of \"already made\" tacos you can just order. Or you can use their huge list to create your own!! We just ordered a few off the already made list and we'll make our own next time. We first got the pineapple guac & chips - holy cow. Never had guac like that before. The only downfall, the chips were really greasy. Onto tacos... I got a taco with chicken (forget the name - queso fresco, pollo,..) and it was SO GOOD. Also got a pulled pork one - even better!! My boyfriend also got the pulled pork one and 2 chorizo. He really liked them all!... keep in mind, the tacos are BIGGER than the other taco places in Pittsburgh so you don't need to order as many. I was stuffed after sharing guac & eating 2 tacos. We actually took some guac & chips home. Service was awesome - quick & very attentive. Can't wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night and only waited about ten minutes (or, as the hostess put it, a \"one margarita wait\" for a party of two).  The service was excellent.  As we had never been here before, the waitress took time out of her running from table to table to stop and explain everything to us, and she was very friendly and attentive.  I'd give the service itself 4 stars.  The food is good...not excellent, but there's a novelty and variety to it that made it something fun and different.  For a mini-chain restaurant, though, the ordering process was kind of overwhelming and confusing at first.  It uses the bubble-in sheets like a Burgatory, but I've always found designing my own burger to be self-explanatory.  This, not so much.  We had to ask for a lot of clarification, so I think they could save their servers some time if they reworked the bubble-sheet ordering form to be more clear and user-friendly. 

The chips and salsa were pretty bland to be honest.  We really enjoyed the tacos and the margarita flights though.  Tequila was super-present, as it should be, but the interesting flavors offered for the margaritas could be easily distinguished as well.  Just one little word to the wise -- the double-layered taco (corn and flour tortilla) are huuuuuuuge (trademark).  I'm not a petite eater, but with two regular and one double-layered taco, I couldn't quite finish.  Not as good as Tako, but liked it better than a Mad Mex or Steel Cactus."}
{"text":"Loud ambiance, lots of tables. 2 bars. Upstairs and 1st Level.

Acoustics make it difficult to hear music, so sound is a lil muffled. Cool hipster staff. Friendly. Knowlegeable. 

Very good make your own Tacos! Two shells available - hard corn and soft (flour) tortilla.wish they had Renyas shells here. Guacamole is OK. 

Full Bar.

Beers on Tap.

Sitting at bar-no hooks for purses or jackets. BOO!

LITERALLY - they just opened.  Give it some time. 

Neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"This place was good but not worth the long happy hour wait. I've heard so many good things but didnt feel like it lived up to the hype. I had a pomegranate margarita and two tacos.

 The margarita was my favorite part of the meal, I liked that they had a lot of flavor options and the flavor was good. My first taco was good, but nothing special. My second taco I got the mango habanero sauce thinking the sweet and spicy would be a great on a taco and it ended up being so spicy I couldn't eat the taco. Could barely taste the mango, it was all habanero. 

I would go back, but I enjoyed Las Velas more for happy hour."}
{"text":"Spicy!!! They need a spice warning for some of these tacos!

Anyway, I was a bit disappointed by my experience here. It was extremely crowded and very loud. You are either going to be crammed in downstairs, or crammed in upstairs. They don't really have menus, you use two different sheets of paper to order by checking what you want in pencil. The first sheet has \"suggested\" tacos and the other sheet is a \"create your own\". I decided to get two suggested tacos. You put your name at the top when you are done filling out your sheet.

At the table they give you plastic sporks and a roll of paper towels. So messy. The cafeteria style sporks just don't work and feel really cheap to me. Can't invest in some real forks? When it was time to deliver the tacos, the waiter would announce the name and you claim your tacos from the tray. When our table got the tacos, we were all confused about who actually had the right tacos. Mine ended up having meat in it, but nobody at the table ordered meat. Apparently I did by accident. There was a spanish word in the description that I did not understand that apparently meant meat. It was a %#*^ show. 

The waiter returned with two new tacos, the Dutch Dragon and George's Dirty Taco. I took one bite of the dutch dragon, and my mouth turned to complete fire. It had guac, portobellos, corn, tomatoes, salsa and of course pickled jalapeños. Again, probably my fault, but they really need a spicy warning. I scarfed down the dirty taco, which seemed spicy too, but maybe it was because my mouth was burning. That one had rice, beans, cheese, onions and \"dirty sauce\". I literally don't know what that means but it was a decent taco. 

So, if you want absolute chaos and a night ending with sticky fingers and a burning mouth, come on down!"}
{"text":"These tacos as so good. And the quest and chips are a perfect blend of cheese and seasoning."}
{"text":"It was Friday night and every place was crowded. The host said we could be seated within 30 minutes, so we decided to wait. There was no place to wait, so we just walked around outside. We were seated upstairs. We ordered the Mango salsa guac and chips, which was good, but not amazing. They had suggested tacos and build-your-own tacos. They did not have a kids menu :( but they offered to make quesadillas, which my kids weren't big fans of. I had a shrimp ceviche taco and thai chili tofu taco. The shrimp seemed undercooked and the tofu was spicy. The flour tortilla tasted like it came from a grocery store out of a bag. There just weren't any amazing flavors. My husband had a surf and turf and the suggested nachos, they were huge, but he didn't find them amazing either. Our waitress was super nice and our margaritas were on point! I had the blood orange and my husband had the blackberry."}
{"text":"I. Love. Tacos. So believe me when I say, I've had my share of them.  I didn't even realize Condado existed until one of my friends randomly stumbled upon this treasure.

For starters, the staff is always super attentive and friendly even when it is super busy (which it usually is).  Each time I go I usually get a margarita. I do have to say they don't have the best margaritas, but their chips and queso make up for it.  I usually do a chip and dip trio which I get the spicy queso, salsa, and guac (per request of the group, I'm not really a guac fan).  The chips and queso are to die for.  I also get El Santo, one of their speciality tacos.  The menu has tacos already made up, or you can make your own.  I can't lie, I love El Santo so much that it's what I normally order, so I can't speak to the other items.  BUT, anything the rest of my group orders they absolutely love.  

The prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is very fun ! I will keep coming back for more, for sure !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place in the the city. I would the highly recommend getting the sweet lucy taco shell with a pulled pork or ghost pepper steak meat. The taco are quite hefty! So even when I come on an empty stomach I can really only eat three. Also the dirty queso as an appitizer is a must order."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool atmosphere and I think the drinks are really reasonably priced. The margarita flight is great!! The guac and the chorizo queso were the bomb as well. The tacos are just so-so but I would definitely go back to try some other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Condado is right where Tonic used to be when I was in Pittsburgh last year. I never went into Tonic so I can't tell you how good that was but I enjoyed Condado.

There were four menus but I only got water for the drink, so that cut the menus down to two. After looking at the create your own taco menu, I gave up and switched to the pre-designed taco menu. That turned out to be a good idea because one of the items on that menu was the Chronic Tortilla Fritos. (bowl of nachos) That was a very filling item for the price. I also tried the Bubba Kush, a pulled pork taco with an interesting flavor. I do like the idea of using a booklet of tear-off fill-in forms for the taco menu. In a noisy bar environment, this avoids the problem of an order getting misheard.

Service was pretty good despite the crowd. I sat at the bar for this meal and the bartender was quite responsive and made sure I had everything I needed. The problem is the dining area is a bit cramped and groups of people who hang around near the bar get in the way of servers and everyone else."}
{"text":"The margaritas are always good!  We had the corn salsa con queen and some chips. We were there for the margaritas so we didn't get food. Nice downtown location   Servers were a little rude though. Don't expect overly friendly service."}
{"text":"Best place I have ever went hands down for tacos. Friends took me out for my birthday here, the atmosphere is great. Definitely recommend the blackberry margarita! As for the tacos they were out of this world. My friends rushed me so I do not think I can ever recreate what I made. However, you cannot go wrong with the chicken and shrimp. I tried the pineapple salsa it was great. 10/10."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 5/5 
Service: 5/5
Drinks: 3.5/5
Food: 3/5
Price: $

I had been really excited to try this place because they serve \"Nick's Crispy Tacos\" style tacos and I love anything tacos. We went on a Tuesday night around 6:30 and were seated upstairs right away at the last available table. 

Our server was charismatic and informative and made the ordering process easy. The margaritas were good, but nothing special. I was slightly disappointed by the food. The tacos were okay but did not have the flavor I was looking for in the tortillas, meats, or toppings. I think fresh flour tortillas would make a big difference. The salsas were also only okay, which is crucial for any Mexican restaurant. 

I may be back for a happy hour with friends, but I'd likely just spend a few extra bucks and head around the corner to Bakersfield."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have never had a bad experience. Service is quick. Drinks are strong. Tacos are great. Queso is amazing! Lots of options for vegetarians/vegans. The jackfruit tacos are outstanding."}
{"text":"Condado is whatever you want it to be! Build your own taco with a huge list of delicious ingredients. 
We have 3 upscale taco joints in Pittsburgh and somehow they have all been able to differentiate themselves. Condado's  build your own is how they stand out. 
You can't start your meal without getting the guacamole and chips. So don't think about it just do it. And drink. ..they have a crazy list of margaritas including banana?!
Every time I come here I get a chicken taco, a seafood taco, and a pork taco. Every time I leave I have dreams about the pork taco! Make sure you get pineapple salsa on it. Whatever magic they cook their pork in is heaven. 

When you order, 2 tacos will fill you up but I always get a third that makes my car smell...but it stinks so good and can be like a pheromone for some men. 

Enjoy! I always do!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I have to be honest I came because I thought this was still Tonic. 
I walked in and the host greeted, or rather grimaced at me.  When I asked for a table, he offered to take me upstairs. I politely declined. He walked away, removed something from a bench, came back and told me he would seat me upstairs...there were two tables in plain sight that were ready and empty. After being seated upstairs I was greeted, wonderfully I might add, by a waitress-Julia. She was all similes and extremely accommodating.  I gave my order of a marguerita,  extra salt, and nachos, custom ordered. She continuously checked on me and made sure I was ok. The marguerita was bland, but the nachos were delicous! I don't know if I'd come here again, but I can say the nachos were really good."}
{"text":"Worst tacos I've ever experienced.  I'm not exaggerating when I say that I would've rather ordered from Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Tacos A La Carte. You can sit down and build your tacos to order... customized in every way.

The guacamole is ridiculously delicious with chips that are freshly made... omg they were addictive.

The tacos were pretty good, but that might have been my own ability to build a less than awesome taco.  We really liked the food and ate up the beans and rice (I don't know what they put into those beans - probably crack)

it is laid-back... and a really good place for Happy hour probably or a low-key date.  FUN place.. good food =)"}
{"text":"If you want to order a lot of tacos don't come here. They want you to fill out one sheet per taco. Unless you wanted multiple numbers of the same type of taco.  If you're there after 10 pm it's too bright but the place has potential if they work out their growing pains."}
{"text":"I was really hyped to try this place. Arrived around 6 on a Thursday evening and it was packed. I didn't mind waiting, but there really was no place to wait (and the weather outside was terrible!). 

We were seated super close to the tables surrounding us, but I didn't mind because I was so excited for tacos. The restaurant was really loud, so if you're looking for a place to catch up and make lots of small talk, perhaps this isn't the joint for you. 

We started with the queso, guacamole, and salsa. The portions were huge and the chips were fresh and bottomless. The create your own tacos were unique. We had a lot of fun deciding what toppings to get. I thought my chicken taco was better than the brisket. I found the brisket to be pretty dry.

Also had a blood orange margarita and would highly recommend that! 

Overall, I was impressed with the menu and the prices. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"One word for this place: awesome! Make your own tacos!? What taco lover wouldn't be into that. I love the fact they don't overcharge you for additional toppings. Prices are really fair. Unique customization options such as super spicy sauces, homemade slaw and delicious guacamole. Great vegetarian options, specifically jackfruit you don't see that often. I didn't have a margarita but they looked excellent. One of my favorite aspects of this place is the interior. So much attention to detail it looks like a local artist designed the graffiti walls. I definitely see this place at the top of the Pittsburgh restaurant scene."}
{"text":"I can't write much about the service, because I ordered to-go (parenting on vacation means 1 parent gets the kids to bed by 7:30, while the other orders to-go from trendy yummy restaurants). I did like the vibe, and this place was pretty crowded even on a Monday night as I ordered at the bar. 

This lived up to 100% of the yelp hype. I wish this existed where I live, because trendy Mexican places for a night out fall so flat. I just about died when I saw the Ju-Ju and Sweet Lucy tortilla options. Queso + chorizo, or queso + guac between the 2 shells? I'm already in heaven and I haven't even figured out what to put in the shells. 

I'm a spice lover, and loved all the sauce options. Price was appropriate for what we got. Would return for a friends night out if I lived here!"}
{"text":"Dang good tacos!  Service was awesome....bartender was extremely helpful and the patrons at the bar were all very nice.  I'm traveling on business and get tired of the same old thing....Condado's was not the same old thing.  I'll definitely be heading back there."}
{"text":"First time there and loved it.  The atmosphere was great and our bartender was awesome.  Drinks were really good.  Tacos are excellent."}
{"text":"I love the build-your-own Taco idea. Toppings are perfect, but I wish they had some more seafood options. Regardless,
You can't go wrong with their happy hour deals!"}
{"text":"Love it! The cheese dip is incredible! The tacos are soooooo good! But the best thing is the craft cocktailing with Dave! It's definitely a good place to get a delightful buzz and a flaming hoop in one package!"}
{"text":"Any time it's a build your own bar, it's usually a disaster for me but this build your own taco place worked in my favor. 

Food: Started with the mango margarita and they definitely did not cheap out on the tequila. One drink was just right for me. We moved on to the Tuscan Guac which was probably the best I've had in a while and a great portion, with two people eating it we only got half way through. 
I got the JuJu taco (soft and hard with queso in the middle) with pulled pork, slaw, beans, onions and salads. So good, I devoured it in seconds. 

Service: we came here the night before and the wait was too long. They do give the option to text you when the table becomes available but we were too hungry to wait. Today we got lucky and got a two seater fairly fast despite the rush. Our waiter was enthusiastic me fast. I was surprised at how fast everything came out. I guess this is what happens when you specialize in one thing. 

Atmosphere: Seems like everything around my hotel in Pittsburgh is just really loud. Found my self having to repeat myself twice when talking due to the loud talking and music. I wonder if it would have been any different upstairs. 

If I lived here I'd def come here for my tacos."}
{"text":"This was tough for me. And I will write an updated review when it's not Cinco de Mayo and I actually consume their food. 
First issue: time proximity was \"2 drinks\", literally that's what they said. Which in retrospect is probably just their way of getting me to drink. I'm thinking 30-45 minutes. Even though we left we still did not receive a text until over 2 hours  later. My issue here is that if it's going to be long and it's going to be 2 hours just let me know. I'll have my drinks and leave. When we asked (an hour in) how long, they wouldn't give us any estimate? Just kept saying \"a long time\". At least tell me how many people were in front of me! 
Another thing: honestly the margs were not that good. They were ok. 

I don't like non up front answers and I don't like withholding information on how long the wait may be. Needless to say we left and got Italian food."}
{"text":"Who doesn't want to create your own taco?! They have a thousand different options for meats, toppings, sauces & so much more. You can literally get queso on your taco. There is even an option to get a crunchy shell wrapped in a soft shell!! (All the crunch, none of the mess) The tacos are excellent and the margaritas are literally to die for. Be prepared for a wait but trust me it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"We stopped in in a busy Saturday afternoon and were mostly pleased with our experience. The food was good and the wait staff was good even though it was busy in there. 

The front door host was in a constant big rush with everyone and spent about one second greeting people until he rushed them to their seats."}
{"text":"First things first, GET THE BRISKET, explanation below. 

I'm a big fan of Condado. IMO, it's a mix between fast food tacos and gourmet tacos. There's a ton of great options. I like building my own tacos and adding as much as I'd like. I highly recommend the brisket, it's extremely flavorful and not dry. 

Service is good, food comes out fast, and it's cheap compared to other tacos joints."}
{"text":"Originally tried Condado in Columbus, Ohio and was super excited to find out there is one here in Pittsburgh!

Going with a toddler for some late night tacos, they did not disappoint!

 Service was exceptional and the tacos.... LOVE!

The ghost pepper salsa..... HOT but soooo good!"}
{"text":"Location: Liberty & Tenth. Good for convention goers, pre-game cultural district show or exploring lunch breakers. Pittsburgh is starting to fill in the Historic District and I can dig it. 

Restaurant: It's small but hip. Wall art is postmodern Dia de los Muertos style. It's artsy and fun. They have both a custom taco option or you can opt into their already developed creations. The price point is kind of what threw me. It's located downtown but I like my taco's cheap. It's more artisan and edgy than I was looking for but I'm game for anything. 

Food/Drink: I got 3 tacos that they designed. They were all completely different in flavor. The drink list is extensive and enjoyable. 

Experience: I was here for lunch break and in a hurry. This place is not tailored to a quick lunch yet, but they are new and I'm sure they will get there. It's a great spot for a quick bite of adventure and a solid drink before you begin your evening adventures."}
{"text":"The one thing Pittsburgh needed! The atmosphere, food, drinks and staff are all amazing. My boyfriend and I go there AT LEAST once a week. We have a taco obsession and this place surpasses standard. The variety you get there is like no other and the combinations are literally endless. The food comes out fast and delicious everytime. Happy hour is amazing and cheap! I'd recommend this place to anyone and everyone."}
{"text":"Great service, so fast! So many choices for tacos, create your own or pick from ones they have. Be adventurous, everything tastes amazing!"}
{"text":"Thank you Condado for offering tasty American tacos. I am part Mexican and love authentic Mexican food. However, I have a picky spouse that has the nerve to complain about said authentic Mexican and is always craving cheddar on tacos with flour tortillas. The existence of Condado has been a blessing in my life. Lol.
 I stopped in with my boyfriend before a birthday party. We both got two tacos that were very filling. You can build your own and there are endless combinations! I had one steak and one pulled pork while my bf got two chicken tacos. He was sooo happy with everything and that made me extra happy. He said it was his new favorite taco place in Pittsburgh. Tacos are the world's most perfectly balanced meal and I am always more than happy to eat them. So, thank you Condado for giving me another excuse to do just that!"}
{"text":"Really good tacos. You can do your standard taco or get some funky combinations for an amazing taco experience! The Margs are delicious too."}
{"text":"A m a z i n g tacos! Good service, and do not take too long! Wide variety of ingredients"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch/work meeting. Despite the lunch rush they were able to accommodate our party of 6 quickly. The food was good and reasonably priced but the overall experience was just ok. Although I would probably come back again, it would not be my first choice for taco place in the city."}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks, and service! Such a great atmosphere. This has a slight resemblance to Smoke, but this restaurant blows Smoke out of the water. This is a definite must experience restaurant. Super amazing!"}
{"text":"Carbonated margs on draft, yes please!!!! This was one great marg, served in a mason jar--so hipster! My tacos were good, but I think I dressed them up too much, and I would recommend simplicity, rather than piling everything on that sounds good. One of my tacos did come out with beef instead of pork, which was a bummer because I was dreaming of a pork and pineapple salsa taco and then it didn't happen. I should have said something, but it was loud and crowded and we were at the bar and I didn't want to annoy the bartenders, who were super busy. Anyway, I'm from out of town, but I really wouldn't mind coming her again while on this trip, so that should tell ya something!"}
{"text":"Every time I came here I say I can not wait to come back. Fantastically fresh and so good. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Started with queso and black beans dip and it was amazing! We shared a Horchata...a little small for the price but it was good. We made our own tacos and had their premade tacos too...el tradicional, bubba kush, Dutch dragon and surf n turf which were all great! Maybe a little too much cilantro for my liking on a few of them but overall a great spot to have lunch. A definite stop for different taco lovers!"}
{"text":"Awesome prices and the service was pretty quick for Downtown lunch hour. I loved the decor as well. Most importantly the tacos are delicious. Definitely check it out if you're in the Downtown Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. You can build your own tacos, or select from a menu of gourmet tacos. I thought I ordered 3 tacos but when my food came out there were two huge, filled to the brim tacos, & a big pile of delicious nachos (pictured below). The two tacos were enough to fill me up, then I have nachos for dinner. 

The ambiance is great. They have a Day of the Dead theme going on, & just about every kind of tequila you could want. The service was quick & friendly. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Condado Tacos makes some of the best tacos I've had in Pittsburgh.  They also make some of the best margarites I've had in Pittsburgh (the blood orange one is, in my opinion, in a rarefied class).  And, much to my surprise, they also have one of the best brunch menus in Pittsburgh (which is basically the taco menu with breakfast options like putting scrambled eggs in your tacos).

The build-your-own taco is inventive, and the wide variety of options makes this a decent place for groups of many sizes and composition, though it's admittedly hard to stick to certain types of \"healthy eating\" diets here.

Now that they have four locations (at the time of this writing) with proven success, I'd say the concept is ready for more rapid expansion.  I'd love to see more locations in the area, and I sincerely hope the owners can find a working model for growth without sacrificing options or quality.  There are many neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and cities in America where this would be a popular restaurant."}
{"text":"Another day, another trendy taco place (or so I thought). Although the tacos here are not at all traditional, they're really fun and inexpensive. 

Condado has a menu of pre-made tacos that you can order, or you can customize your own. Tacos are three dollars a piece, and two are usually enough. I've never tried the pre-made tacos, but I always have a blast ordering my own creations. They have a variety of shells--flour, hard corn shells, and a couple of combinations of both, some with melted cheese, beans, etc. The chorizo is probably my favorite meat there, and it's a nice place for people that are lactose intolerant--it's so easy to skip the cheese!! 

The margs are fun too--I enjoy the banana one a lot! I've been back, and will be back."}
{"text":"I was in town and was craving mezcal margaritas so we came here. It's eh. Mezcal was good but even when i kept ordering different flavors, i didnt get much flavor. I didnt get to try the food except for the guac and salsa, but my bf tried the tacos. He said they were good. I did like that you can basically create your own taco."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite taco spot in Pittsburgh. It puts the two other downtown taco restaurants to shame. The upstairs inside isn't super fancy but it has a ton of light so you can actually see your food (I don't like eating in the dark TaKo) and it isn't so loud that you can't hear your dinner companions. 

I love love love the ordering system. You choose from the printed list what you want on your taco and you can customize down to the tiniest detail. They also offer daily specials and I'm bummed that I was too full to try the Korean BBQ taco with kimchee but if it's offered the next time I got I will absolutely save room!

The bartenders were really friendly and well informed on the menu and the margaritas were delish. We also really loved the guacamole and chips. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"When I heard we were getting a new taco place in downtown I was beyond thrilled. Who doesn't love tacos? I know I think about tacos almost all day every day. A group of friends and I stopped here one Saturday after the Winefest to give it a try. I think it was safe to say the entire group loved it.

The decor of this place is spot on and I absolutely loved it. The drink menu was very extensive and had a lot of mexican drinks that you don't see all that often. Ever since I had a michelada on vacation years ago I have had trouble finding places that served them. They also have a variety of margarita flavors that you won't find most places. Sure other places have your strawberry or raspberry but Condada has banana, prickly pear, peach, jalapeno, and the list goes on. Our waitress recommended a mix of strawberry and jalapeño which I will definitely be trying next time!

Most importantly though, and the main reason I gave it a 5 star, is the tacos. Don't get me wrong it is hard for me to not like a taco. What I like most about this place is the fact that you can create your own tacos. I don't mean just pick your meat, toppings, and shell. You can choose from a corn tortilla, to a flour, to a hard shell within a flour with cheese in the middle. They have multiple meets, sauces, cremes, etc. For those that don't want to create their own they also have suggested tacos that you can order. Most of which looked delicious but as a first timer I obviously had to create me own. 

All in all, I think Condado Tacos is definitely worth checking out and I would highly recommend it. And when you do go get yourself some chorizo queso! It's amazing."}
{"text":"I gave it a try, but won't go back. I'll stick to Bakersfield where everything is consistently great. 

1) queso: this is basically cheese soup. This is obviously something store bought and microwaved. It literally dripped off the chips. Kindof hard to eat chips and queso when the queso just runs right off. 
2) tacos: I ordered my own, not the pre made suggestions. A brisket and a chicken taco. The meat was cooked at some point in the day, but wasn't even remotely warm when I got it. I guess it had just been sitting there. Other than that, not bad. Tacos are hard to mess up. 
3) utensils/plates/lack thereof: I get it. You're trying to save money. But this is a taco place. Tacos are messy. You need plates if people are going to be sharing chips and queso. You can't just build a plate fort out of paper towels. Your location is downtown, so I assume you're appealing to the business crowd during lunch hours. These people wear suits and ties, etc. Come on...
4) service: in the case that you only provide paper towels, please be sure that the servers are attentive. Ours ran out at the table. I timed it for 20 minutes and nobody brought us any more. So that's the equivalent of not having a plate for 20 minutes. Also as I was leaving, the hostess was at the door and was not going to say bye. I stared her down until she said bye to me. 
5) cleanliness: there was food remnants all over the floor and all over the tables...and benches... the entire time I was there. Probably because there aren't any plates or utensils, but someone could be cleaning this up...
6) \"sides\": ordered a side of rice. This came in a tiny condiment dish, with a plastic spork. It was the driest, stickiest rice ever. Basically minute rice. No flavor. Chipotle had this beat hands down."}
{"text":"I feel like I am supposed to love this Taco spot, but for me it fell short and was a confusing experience.

We were seated quickly on a Saturday afternoon. The place is super small so I can see it becoming packed on a normal night. The atmosphere and decor was super cool and had a really nice vibe. I was excited!

I sat down to what felt like 6 menus and had no idea what to do with no direction from our server. I first ordered the margarita flight because they had about 10 different margarita flavors. I had the blackberry, strawberry and pomegranate. They were fresh and delicious!! We also had the queso appetizer. The queso was thick and creamy, mmmm. However, I was not a fan of the homemade chips. They were so thick and greasy it totally took away the flavor of the queso. I know most people like chips like this, but I'll pass.

I ordered 2 tacos. I would love to say what I had- but I honestly have no idea. There are a ton of options so you can be as crazy or as basic as you would like. I got both with chicken. One in a four shell, one in the sweet Lucy shell. This shell had guac in it, which I do not like, but there was nowhere to request no guac on the sheet. I meant to tell the server, but forgot which is my fault. However it would be nice if they went over your choices with you when you hand them your sheet. My one taco I got pineapple salsa which was delicious, however the chicken was sort of blan for me. My other taco I got one of the cream sauces which was also very good. Both tacos for me just tasted like the sauce, which was yummy but I wanted more. Next time I will try one of their speciality made tacos. (There are good options for vegetarians, too!)

The food comes out SO FAST. Which is great however I had no time to drink my margarita flight so next time I probably would not get a drink or even appetizer. This would be great during a quick lunch rush, though.

The prices here are awesome. Each taco is $3.50 with certain upcharges and specialty tacos being more. Happy hour is $1 off tacos and there are drink specials! You cannot beat that.

Overall everything was good, but not great. I will be back to try again."}
{"text":"I must have caught them on an off night because my whole experience was meh. The only reason I gave two stars is because the queso is amazing. You fill a slip out and pick your tacos fillings and sides. 
Service: now I give servers the benefit of the doubt on a Friday during happy hour but this was really bad. She mixed up a lot and after we were specific and walked her through what each of us had she still messed up the checks. This was after having to get other servers to flag her down so we could order drinks and get water refills

Food: like I mentioned before the queso was fantastic. The chips are fresh made and I dug those. Tacos I got two crispy tacos and the shells were super greasy. The shrimp in was good but they weren't filled very well. 

Honestly, the whole experience was underwhelming, but there is so many good reviews that I may try it again."}
{"text":"Service is very fast during lunch as it hasn't been very crowded the couple of times I've gone for lunch. 

I am seeing some negative reviews from Cinco de Mayo recently - yes, that was a train wreck. People were not relinquishing their tables for hours after paying (note to the public, even on a normal day, if a restaurant is packed and people are waiting and you paid your bill thirty minutes ago - leave. Seriously. The problematic Cinco de Mayo was largely because of inconsiderate guests in my opinion). Granted, when we finally sat down, the waiter was rather rude when I said we had more people but I suggested that when the people who finished next to us left (ie one of the aforementioned parties who paid their bill and did not leave) then they would come and sit there, but he then told them to take their time to spite me. After that his crass and vulgar service was more for comedic effect but it initially was not appreciated. I imagine it was the busy day that had everyone on edge.

Otherwise, the tacos are great. Good size, and I love their combo of soft and hard, held together with cheese. Yum. You can build your own or go for premade combos. I would recommend trying out the jackfruit as as meat substitute - very similar to pulled pork in texture but with a sweet tanginess that adds dimension to the taco.  

A large variety of margarita flavors is fun for happy hour. I like the prickly pear flavor best."}
{"text":"I have to say - I was expecting MUCH more after I heard all of the hype. You can either build your own taco or try one of their creations. I tried both and I was highly disappointed. My meat was very dry and the flavors were just bland. I will say the chips and queso were pretty great. I would go back for the queso & margs but that's about it."}
{"text":"Cool taco spot. I ordered 4 tacos. First taco (George's Dirty Taco) it was a good taco packed with savory flavor. Second (The Mantis) a yummy jackfruit taco with some spice. I enjoyed it. Third and fourth was the same taco I have to say it was my least favorite (Dutch Dragon) it was just to many flavors in this taco. Not my favorite, not bad, just my least favorite of the bunch. I liked the feel of this place. It has a cool hipster taco vibe. Plus the beer selection was good. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I built my own tacos again. This time was much more enjoyable. I focused on less ingredients and more flavors. The chorizo is very flavorful and will be my go to meat when I come here for tacos. I also got a taco with the brisket and I'd never do that again. It was soaked from the juice it sits in and made the whole taco fall apart. The honey chipotle sauce is delicious and it compliments mostly everything. 

The basil blueberry margarita was overrated sadly. I tasted no basil and the blueberries were lack luster. I tasted mostly just tequila and nothing else. 

I still find this place to be a unique taco restaurant in Pittsburgh and it's enjoyable every time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great happy hour specials. Perfect place to stop if you are at the Convention Center and need a quick bite to eat. We had the dip sampler and two great cocktails. Chips were plentiful, thin and freshly made and the salsas were great!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! Let me get my two negatives outta the way: 
1. So effing loud! Full of woo girls
2. They don't use the Nowait app
3. Waiting area is non existent 

Ok now to the good stuff. The margaritas are so good! I recommend getting a pitcher to share, it's more economical.

The guac and queso are killer and the homemade chips always crispy and perfectly salted. 

The build your own taco scheme is so simple it's genius! You cant go wrong with the shells but I would recommend hard over soft. The juices from the salsas and sauces and meats will make the floor tortilla soggy.

I haven't met a meat there that wasn't good. Seriously just go. NOW!"}
{"text":"Went here around 730 on a Saturday with two friends.  It wasn't overly busy we got right in.

We were very excited to try it however the services was atrocious.  They brought my friends drinks out incorrectly 3x.  The waitress kept running away before I could even order one.  Once I finally did it came out 30 minutes into us being there because she forgot it. 

We ordered chips and salsa.  Salsa was good, the top few chips were good, the rest were crushed, like inedible without a spoon crushed.  

Got past that and finally got out Taco orders in.  The tacos are more like 3 stars - pretty good.  I loved the different options you can create for yourself.  Tacos are reasonable and good size portion.  I got the pork and the chicken.  Pork was way better than the chicken.  Didn't love that they didn't have traditional corn tortillas as an option, but they have other unique shell options that are reminiscent of Taco Bell (in a good way). 

The menu situation is also weird, there's like 4 different menus.  I don't understand why they can't condense it to 2 menus, one to order off of and one for drinks.  I would go back to give them another shot on service and chips, but not running back."}
{"text":"I'm from California, and Pittsburgh doesn't have many great places to get some tacos. This will be our new go to when the craving strikes! Very fun space, good food, and cheap prices! Yes, they are new. Yes, they are working out a few things... but that certainly doesn't warrant a shitty review. Well worth a visit!! Go get some tacos, you won't regret it! Also, if you get the delicioso (cucumbers, jalapeños, and soda water) margarita -- it is HOT! And delicioso, just like the tacos."}
{"text":"Yes, yes more please.  Excellent tacos and drinks.  Ordered chicken tacos with the ju-ju tortillas.  Hard & soft with cheese and chorizo between the layers.  Whoever thought of this idea is a mad genius.  The only negative is that they didn't have the juice for the prinkly pear margarita but not a big deal."}
{"text":"Condado is a great spot for some delicious tacos in the Cultural District. One of the best parts about Condado is the affordability, which is often hard to find in that area of town. 

I stopped in for lunch with a friend on Saturday afternoon. There was plenty of availability for seating, both upstairs and downstairs. 

I ordered the blanco queso and two tacos: one surf and turf and one bubba kush. The queso was divine and there was so much of it--your dollar goes far here. The tacos arrived almost a minute after the queso (the service was so fast!) and they were also delicious. The bacon black beans on the Bubba Kush taco were smokey and delicious. I also enjoyed how the crunchy corn tortilla was wrapped in a flour tortilla, so you get the crunch but everything holds together. The surf and turf taco (only $5!) comes with steak and shrimp ceviche. The flavor was excellent but there were so many flavors going on that it was hard to find the ceviche at times, though everything still tasted great. 

Condado is affordable with some excellent tacos! You can also build your own, but I decided to go with the recommended combinations and was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Three evenings in Pittsburgh, PA, and three evenings in a row I've eaten at Condado Tacos.  This evening, I carried out 3 tacos, all the same, and I spoke with the host to who took placed my order, and delivered my order.  I told him I was highly impressed from the first bite of the first taco I ate there.  The price, I told him, isn't only cheap, it's completely underpriced because the quality of food exceeds what can found elsewhere.  I also let him know I'd be providing a rave review on Yelp, and he was delighted to learn that they really impressed a new customer."}
{"text":"Just happened upon this restaurant/bar while partaking of the International Jazz Festival last Sunday evening around 5pm.  A lot of restaurants were closed even though this major event was taking place -- not great planning on business's part, I'd think.  
Anyway, after walking around seeing most places not open, we spotted Condado Tacos and strode in.

Soooo very glad we did!  First of all it's enticing just visually -- all around you is art -- on the walls, on the stairs (don't forget to look at those stairs)!   I was impressed by that alone.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and helpful.  We ordered some tacos and were given some chips and salsa.  I had shrimp in mine and was very happy, indeed.  When all was said and done and eaten, the final bill was around 20 dollars for the two of us.  I'd say that was a fair meal and a tasty one, too!

When I posted pics of this place on FB, I was surprised when several of my friends said it was their favorite taco place.  Why the heck am I just finding out about it??  Well, at least I have now!"}
{"text":"It's a shame that their food was amazing but the service was unbelievably terrible. I will not recommend Condado Tacos to anyone.

Condado Tacos was a 10 minute walk away from our hotel so we thought it'd be nice to walk and explore the city instead of driving there. Upon arrival, the hostess explained about the happy hour special and the upstairs seating situation. We opt to eat upstairs and pay everything regular price because we were starving (and a bit tired). 

Downstairs has a pub/bar style going on, and upstairs is your regular hippy, cool, relaxed Mexican restaurant. Our waitress asked if we've been here before and if we knew how to order - we told her no. So she went on to taking our drinks order and left. We thought the drinks would come quickly so she'll explain how things work here when she's back, but after a pretty long wait, not only were we still waiting for the drinks, we were left there confused with the menu. I had to flag her down and ask, which is when she finally told us how to make your own taco and write them down on the sheets. She also reassured us to start small and order more later on because the service here is very fast.

We ordered 2 drinks initially, then we got 2 Bubba Kush, 2 Chronic Tortilla Fritos, and 1 make your own taco. One of our drinks finally came, then the Fritos and our self-created taco arrived. Almost finishing our meal, I reminded our server about our second drink. This was after waiting for about 15 minutes for our food and drinks, and at least another 15 minutes into our meal, and we were still waiting for our second drink. With no apologies, our waitress disappeared once again, and was back with our second drink after awhile. 

And it just gets worse...we were done with the Fritos and taco, we were just sitting there and chatting, because we expected our 2 Bubba Kush to eventually arrive. After being in the restaurant with no attention from our server, and waiting for the rest of our food for about 20 minutes after finishing all our food on the table, we gave up. We asked for the bill and left. 

Don't get me wrong, the tacos were amazing, but the service was unbelievable - even though she had some cool purple lipstick on. I'd rather go to McDonalds for a better time."}
{"text":"I LOVE Condado Happy Hour!!! It is Monday - Friday 5-7 in the bar area (first floor).  You get $1 off each taco and the margaritas are half price! 

The margaritas here are soooo good! They have a ton of different flavors and I swear each one is more delicious than the next! I haven't tried a flavor I didn't like.  The tacos are customize-able which is fun, but always makes me nervous I'll make a terrible combination.  Luckily they have some pre-made selections if you need suggestions.  

I highly recommend the \"Sweet Lucy\" shell which is a hard shell, queso, guac, and a flour tortilla.  The queso appetizer is pretty addicting too!   This past visit one of the food runners ended up with extra chips and salsa and gave it to us for free which was so nice! I would definitely order the queso or guac over the salsa, but it was great to try it! I would not recommend the chorizo in your taco unless you like things realllly spicy.  It was the only thing I would change about an otherwise great dinner at Condado."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good! Please try the Ooey Gooey taco! The guac was pretty good as well, my friend slopped it all up.
Now that we got the foods out the way, let's get on to the experience and some minor concerns.
We did come during Happy Hour, that has awesome happy hour prices. Of course it was a bit busy but super loud in there. The seating area on the bottom area can feel a bit cramped during the busy times. There is a second floor but I am not sure of the layout.
At first, we felt annoyed by the lack of attentiveness to get started with out order. But again, like I said it was busy. Once we were with our waitress, she was on top of things. It was just a slow start 
The margaritas are a part of the happy hour special. (Half hour margaritas and a 1$ dollar off tacos) The margaritas were very weak! I usually can feel a margarita the first glass. They need to kick it up a notch. What's the point of drinking a margarita without  kick and fun!?
However, this restaurant is the place to hit if you have a craving for a taco that makes you melt and wanna slap your mama.
I heard they are opening one in Lawrenceville. And I can't wait to continue eating to Ooey Gooey taco, and try more."}
{"text":"I went here twice in the span of 24hrs for dinner and brunch; If you want the best damn tacos in Pittsburgh, these are the best damn tacos in Pittsburgh. 

I'm a big fan of Doce Taqueria, Tako, Bakersfield, El Burro and even Las Palmas but Condado Tacos is THE best in Pittsburgh and here is why.

(You can skip to the last paragraph if you not like read long)
1. THE Tacos
Starting with the queso or guac is a must here. Ooey-gooey melty goodness that is just ooh wow hot wow delicious. The diablo queso isn't as spicy as you'd imagine and the Tuscan guac is pretty fantastic.Chips and corn shells are fresh and are bomb dot com. The ability to build your own tacos gives you the ability to royally \"F\" your own taco, but it also gives you the ability to make an incredibly tasty masterpiece. Brunch, Lunch or Dinner, their Chorizo is really, really (I mean REALLY REALLY) good. Their pulled pork doesn't beat Doce but their brisket, steak, ceviche, chicken, and portobellos are all expertly seasoned and absolutely delicious and mouth-wateringly tasty (the steak and ports with eggs for breakfast is just ughhhmazing.) Sauces- GREAT, salsas- just meh, but fresh.

2.The Drinks
This is a bar that sells tacos.Good beer selection(taps and cans), a plethora of tequila and a bunch of cocktails that are pretty darn good (although they can be pretty strong...which is a bonus in my book). Also, Micheladas. Year round. Love me a michelada. These guys aren't the cocktail kings, but they have good stuff and great prices, especially during happy hour.

3.Everything else
This bar pulls out the stops. Great location with enough seating so you don't have to wait forever; Enough room at the bar for those who want to drink the night away and the atmosphere(super cool vibes) that encourages it, if you wanted. Coat/purse hooks under tables and at the bar; A convenient touch for comfort. Kitchen is open till one 7 days a week so you can grab your midnight snack, drunk or not, any night of the week. A rewards program that makes you want to go back over and over and a Happy Hour that really makes that easy. Lastly, but not leastly, the service is good and with time will be great. Patrick was there day and night and went out of the way to make sure we understood everything, as well as making sure we were topped off and satisfied. 

ALL IN ALL, the prices here align with your typical taqueria ($3 tacos +$ for anything special) yet taste like your upscale fancy pants taco (I'm talking about Tako and Bakersfield). They don't charge you or focus on presentation and location and that alone is commendable. Drinks are great and they are appropriately styled and priced. Service is still growing its roots and confidence but is still good. 

I'll be a regular here. A Condadoer. A condadooy. Condaddy? Whatever, I'll be there weekly. 
(Condaddy for sure) lol."}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour. Half off margaritas and discount on tacos. I usually get 2 tacos and I'm filled up completely. Tacos come out pretty fast so the waits usually aren't too long."}
{"text":"This place was ok it was to dark. No one at my table could read our menu due to the lack of lighting. The taco were good but they were very small for the price. The waitress seem to forget about us more than once."}
{"text":"First time! This place is really awesome!  A lot of choices to add on your tacos and delicious margaritas. Loved the chorizo and the pineapple salsa. Plus the salsa verde is really good too!  Can't want to go back and try some other salsas and queso.  If you go during happy hour make sure to order the single glasses not the pitcher. Cheaper that way."}
{"text":"The chicken was salty and the sauces were too sweet."}
{"text":"Tacos were just okay.  The big disappointment is that the Margaritas are soda based!   I don't know if they do it to save $ or what?  Any true fan of a good margarita knows it should be lime juice based.  Staff was friendly and they did have a nice mezcal selection (but no mezcal ritas).  I'd spend a little more and go to Bakersfield or Tako.

Update (7/1/18): I've been back and now love their tacos! The 1st time that I went was just after they opened, and I think that's why the food wasn't that good. Haven't gave their margaritas a second chance, but they have a great draft selection."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for a late lunch on the weekend.  The decor is hip Mexican with a cute bar.  It's cozy and inviting.  The service was very attentive and friendly.  We ordered the Anejo Manhattans and the cranberry guac to start.  The Manhattans were ok, they came on the rocks which isn't my favorite way to drink a Manhattan and they were a little too sweet.  The guac was ok and reminded me of the store bought kind, though the toppings dressed it up.  There was an option for  build your own taco, but we opted for the already put together kind.  I got a surf and turf, but didn't really see any steak.  I also got the taco with the jackfruit and double taco shell held together with queso.  That one was pretty good.  I feel like if they focused on making a few things really good, rather than having such extensive options, it could be better.  I would say that if we were in the area, we might stop for an appetizer and drink, but wouldn't make it a destination."}
{"text":"I've been to Condado a few times now and it's always good! The place has a cool hip vibe. The downstairs is a little small but there is also plenty of seating upstairs. The one thing I don't like is they don't take reservations. They have so many flavors of margaritas and offer a flight for $15 which is so fab! Queso is amazing especially with the chorizo in it. The chips are salted to perfection. The tacos are build your own so you fill out exactly what you want on a little form at your table. They offer lots of options. $3.50 for a taco so prices are reasonable and also the tacos are a decent size. I had 2 and I was stuffed. I recommend the chorizo and shrimp. I really love the tortilla options too...goody goody is my personal fav. On my last trip there the server wasn't very nice and we had to ask twice for water but we did get our food really fast. If you're in the mood for some tasty tacos and margs this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Thought this place sucked, quite honestly.  Served me beer in a plastic cup like I was an a college frat party. Tacos remind me of what a taco would look like if a seven year old was trying to be clever and making cool tacos. If you want your tacos to be unusually sweet and taste like they were dipped in a swimming pool that hasnt been cleaned in nine weeks, come here. They also have no hot sauce that could can drizzle on the tacos yourself. Dafuq."}
{"text":"I came late on a Saturday night and had to wait over 45 minutes in the rain for a table, and once we were seated had to use the flashlight on my phone in order to read the menu--but despite all that I would still name my first child Condado. I get a little overzealous when it comes to build your own menus, so I stick with the 'taco suggestions' which all happen to be divine. I think my ideal last meal on earth would be at least four bowls of their queso blanco and a pitcher of blood orange mango margarita (my favorite of their many margarita flavors) (they also have the option of marg flights, an idea which may surpass the wright brothers idea for the first airplane)."}
{"text":"Service was slow and virtually every food had an obscene amount of sugar in it. Trying to get anything spicy was a  real challenge."}
{"text":"This place is SO COOL. They have a build your own taco menu, a very extensive liquor menu, & some really good looking cocktails. Whenever you order a margarita, you get to pick the tequila that goes in it! AND they have the tequilas listed by quality! There are a good amount of vegetarian options as well, which is always a plus for me. I ordered one with the Thai chili tofu & one with Portobello mushrooms. Everything was very fresh tasting & their corn tortillas were THE BEST. We also tried their Queso special which was loaded baked potato... it kind of just tasted like potato soup on chips, but it was quite pleasing. The tacos are cheap & the drinks are a decent price for being downtown. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has long happy waits if you don't get there early. That means it's good right?? I would say it was good, but didn't live up to the hype. I had a blackberry margarita with two tacos. The margarita was the best part of my meal. The tacos were good, but the flavor wasn't as developed as I had hoped for the flavor combos that I was able to pick on the create your own. Food came out very quick.

Warning the mango habanero sauce is mainly habanero tasting with just a touch of mango, I was hoping for the opposite. It overpowered the taco. 

I would go back, but I think Las Velas is better for happy hour margaritas."}
{"text":"To the extremely stressed out waitress that just talked down to me without provocation - I'm SO incredibly sorry. The hostess told my husband and I that we were next to sit outside so when a couple left we waited around but given the extremely crowded environment we proceeded to sit down and patiently wait for service. Please understand that we had no way of knowing that you were \"holding the table\" for the previous patrons who were out in the crowd enjoying the concert. Also please note that it is not standard procedure to \"hold\" unbussed tables in a crowded restaurant while patrons go off to participate in other activities. Frankly, it sounds risky from a walk-out-on-the-bill perspective but hey I'm not here to judge. But I would like to share a basic customer service tip: try to maintain a professional tone when speaking to patrons irregardless of your stress level especially when they do something intuitive like sit at an empty table. It's our first time in Pittsburg and it's a busy Friday night. We had attempted to get a table at two other places before arriving at your restaurant, we're tired, we're hungry but we are respectful. We didn't deserve your tone, you talked down to us as if you were dealing with a pair of irate assholes when we were simply confused - confused that you had walked by us multiple times but failed to mention we were grossly infringing on your \"reserved\" table ... confused that you're suddenly back and telling us to \"take it up with management ...\" wait? what? Remember me? About 10 minutes prior when you could barely get through all the people I sympathized with you ... I leaned over and commented on how difficult your job must be tonight ... Why are you suddenly talking down to us? You turned business away from your employer tonight and left a small stain on what would have otherwise been a lovely evening."}
{"text":"#TacoTues, #queso and #margs are certainly all the rage lately; and you've probably heard a millennial raving about this place - but let me assure you this place is more than an Instagram foodies' dream come true! Condado is just simply fun and delicious.

I have visited many times and always leave full and satisfied from the food. I will keep returning as there are so many options to create your own margaritas, chip & dip companions, and taco creations. 

Anyplace that has margarita flights is for me. I love that I can try a few of the fruit flavors and not break the bank at $15 for 3 decently sized margs. I am particular about drinks and I do enjoy their margaritas. Plus they are relatively inexpensive (for a downtown spot) .

I also love that Condado offers fresh chips with flaky salt (important) plus many unique salsa combinations, fresh guac and flavorful queso. 

I could fill up on just chips and dip -  but then there are the tacos. You get to build your own tacos for a reasonable price! I stick to the non-spicy options and have plenty of elements to choose from. I love their unique taco shell combinations, pulling both soft and hard shell with cheese and chorizo in between - delicious!  My first visit I ordered 3, when one was probably large enough. They come fully stuffed and are'nt dry due to all the cheese, salsas and sauce you can have packed on top. 

I definitely enjoy their food, but for me the service has always been underwhelming. All but 1 server I've had has been uninspiring. Serve has been very transactional and servers are uninterested in answering questions and or sharing suggestions. I remember being lost of the process during my first visit. The menus are confusing and the monthly features are not easy to find - and the servers definitely do not offer to walk you through the form or the multiple menus, nor do they mention the special dip or meat of the month. 

My most recent visit I actually did have a pleasant, friendly server. I sat outside and she must have been inspired by the sun as she did welcome sharing suggestions.  :)"}
{"text":"Easily the greatest tacos I've had in Pittsburgh. So many options. Love the build your own aspect. And all for $3 a taco!"}
{"text":"The Burgatory equivalent of a taco place. 

Each person can choose from staff-recommended taco combinations, or they can step out of their comfort zone to create a custom taco creation.  With a topping check list and a pencil, you choose how wild or safe your tacos will taste. 

The best part is the outside shell options: if you thought it was just soft or hard, corn or flour, you were wrong! Get wild, go condado. 

At just $3.50 a taco, you can switch it up and not feel bad about it. 

Great location, but a little tight on space. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing build your own Tacos or specialty tacos from a menu.  Good atmosphere and a great selection of beers."}
{"text":"Most delicious tacos ever. You have to like spicy though because everything has a bite to it. Also, be prepared for a wait, especially if you have a larger group, but most definitely worth it."}
{"text":"So the hostess as soon as I walked in was a bit rude. I told her I was just eating solo and preferred a table instead of the bar. She asked if a high table was fine and I asked if a regular table was available and she seemed visibly annoyed that I was only one person taking up a table for 3. It was around 5pm when I went in and it wasn't that crowded either. Thankfully when my waitress got there, she was SUPER friendly and helpful and explained the whole menu to me and all the different styles of tacos and how to customize them since I wanted to build my own. She was great. The sauces definitely left me wanting more. I got their secret sauce and I would say it was more sour than spicy. Then again, I am Indian and used to ass-burning heat lol. So I would say if you want really spicy heat, this place won't do it for ya. I got the guac and chips and those were really good but wasn't a fan of the pickled onions on top of the guac. I did build your own tacos, one hard corn shell, one soft, both with rice and black beans on them, lettuce, cilantro, onions and queso fresca. The rice itself didn't have much flavor or seasoning to it and I was a bit surprised that there were only black beans offered and not refried. The black beans also weren't seasoned or anything at all so not much flavor. The other option if you don't eat meat was the tofu or mushrooms and I don't really eat either. I probably won't be back here."}
{"text":"Best. Tacos. Ever!  Margaritads and tequila collection are  out of this world  you've gotta check this place out. The atmosphere is another thing that makes it. theres graffiti all over the walls and bathrooms and they play awesome indie music all night. So yeah come check out this hip new cool place! / tacos! Very best I've ever had and I've had tacos all over the country!"}
{"text":"We love this spot.  Travel to Pgh a few times a year, this is a must have. Decor, vibe, food.......always spot on."}
{"text":"This place was great! Awesome atmosphere with excellent tacos, guacamole and salsa! My butthole is still on fire!"}
{"text":"Finally got down here for the first time last weekend.  As more and more taco places open up around the city I was impressed when this easily became one at the top of my list!

Totally customizable, you can create multiple tacos, each one with a different flavor and taste. I made one of mine spicy and one sweet, the perfect balance.

They have margaritas made in house and I would get one in a heartbeat if you can!"}
{"text":"This actually may be my new favorite taco spot in Pittsburgh. I just really love the vibe. The food is good and the price is right on point with what you should pay for tacos in a Downtown Pittsburgh location. There is a downstairs and upstairs, giving it plenty of space for patrons.

You build your own tacos here. You fill out a form of what you want and the quantity you want. They also have a few \"house\" recommended ones on another form you can fill out. Great variety on everything from taco shells, meat, and sauces. You could make a TON of different tacos if you wanted. I had three totally different tacos. I loved them all! We also ordered an order of chips with gauc + two salsas. I think that was actually my favorite part. I lied... the pitcher of peach margaritas was my favorite part.

I will be back like 1000 times."}
{"text":"As Good As It Gets!

Great tacos?  Check
Great craft beer selection? Check
Margaritas? Didn't have one, but menu looked great
Great Happy Hour? Check
Atmosphere? Check
Space?  Eh, not really, but that's totally fine if the above is great right?

If you are familiar with Burgatory or any restaurant that allows you to customize your burger by filling out a check list with a pencil, then this is the same concept, but for tacos.  You do however have the ability to just go with their menu of tacos created by their chefs without creating your own of course.  

Overall 13 out of 5 stars.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and tasty tacos. Love love love that they have jackfruit on the menu, and they do it very well. Happy hour prices are great if you can get a table downstairs, does feel a bit lousy that they don't do happy hour upstairs. The one time we sat upstairs we not only didn't get happy hour pricing, but the service was also extra slow."}
{"text":"I went to meet with some friends for margarita    Happy hour. I didn't stay long enough to review the service but I did stay for a taco. It's nice that they offer $3, $4, and $5 taco choices but the flavor was not for me. 

I come from Texas where Mexican and tex-mex restaurants probably outnumber Starbucks so I was pleasantly surprised to have found a few restaurants nearby that mirrored those delicious dishes. The only downside outs none of my regulars had happy hour, which brought us to this establishment. Their taco fillings were definitely on the experimental fusion side but tasty. There was one my friend ordered that was completely vegetarian but tasted like pulled pork! Sadly any delicious taco can be crippled with a not so tasty tortilla. The surf n turf taco I ordered was served on a flour tortilla that tasted like those processed package ones you'd find at a grocery store, not like the homemade fresh ones mama makes. If you are going to buy from the store, it's best to just purchase corn. It would surprise and disappoint me further if  the tortillas were made in house."}
{"text":"This is typically our favorite place for date night. Tonight we went in and were immediately seated,  which is rare for a Friday night. The service was slow and inefficient. Which was also surprising considering how slow the incoming traffic was. We ordered drinks which came pretty fast, then everything else came very slow. We were charged for items we never received and not frequently checked on by our service. The food was okay. It was room temp by the time we received it. The stars are mostly for previous experiences. Im not ready to give up yet. I would try again as i typically will wait at least a half hour because service food and drinks is usually exceptional"}
{"text":"All they serve are tacos (which weren't the best I've tasted), the wait was long, and you don't have a choice of frozen or over ice margarita's (only over ice).  In my opinion it wasn't worth the hassel of going downtown, finding a parking space, and then paying for parking."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. My husband and I came in for a Saturday date and couldn't have been more pleased. We ordered off the create your own taco menu and all 4 came out delicious! We both had a chicken and a chorizo taco with different toppings. We also had the chorizo quest which was perfect. The waitress was very nice and because the tacos took longer than normal to come out they gave us tortilla chips on the house, which was very nice. I also ordered a beer that had just kicked and they gave me the rest anyways. Overall a very pleasant visit and will definitely recommend everyone go to Condado."}
{"text":"Got the table quickly for our party. Server was very frazzled waiting on our table. Forgot to get water for 10-15 minutes after we asked. My food came out cold. I asked about it and was told something about all the ingredients being refrigerated... so now I'm supposed to believe that meat is served cold here. Server finally agreed that the meat is not supposed to be cold, and took it back to ask the kitchen remake it. 

I didn't really have much of an appetite after the remake came out... the tacos were all drenched in sauce and the shells were moist and sticky. I just gave up after that. This place got 2 stars because the hostess was incredibly friendly and understanding, and the manager was great and refunded my purchase before I walked out. Rest of the group stayed and trucked on; hopefully they had a better experience than me."}
{"text":"We hit Condado last night and I believe I have a new \"go to\" place when people come to visit us in Pittsburgh. 

It was starting to get busy when we got there at 5:20. It's perfect for the after-work crowd to have some cocktails and some excellent tacos. Luckily, we were able to be seated upstairs with no problem.

We started our meal with a couple of drinks. For the four of us, a couple of the drinks were hit or miss. For instance, my Modelo-Ritas were perfect, but one of our group had trouble tasting any gin in his Ghost Gin and Tonic. 

We then ordered probably one of the best queso I have ever had: Condado's Dirty Queso (chicken, black bean, onion, and dirty sauce) served with really good chips. We then ordered the Chorizo Queso, and while it was good, it was not as good as the Dirty Queso we had just had.

Order made-to-order tacos were perfect. I ordered shrimp ceviche on a flour tortilla with onions, and cilantro and it was excellent. My other two tacos were chicken (with a wonderful smoke to it) on flour tortillas with smoked cheddar and salsa roja.

The service was excellent and the prices fair.

Give this place a try. I do not think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"No tacos are created equal. My new year's resolution was to eat more yummy food and after this adventure I'm good. I've officially ate at all the taco spots downtown. This place is in my top list of tacos ever and it wasn't expensive for what I got. First, a build your own taco spot is genius. I went with the shrimp ceviche taco and a chicken taco and to no surprise the shrimp one was delicious. When it eventually fell a part I let my fork finish it off. It was jam packed with so much flavor. I'm still \"Why haven't I been here earlier?\" I love the decor and the service was great. The music had today's jams on it and the bar... Sheesh! You name it they have it and if you can't name it, they'll find you something you like. I definitely have to check this place out as they're always packed but there's a reason they're always packed. Good food is good food and they know tacos."}
{"text":"So me and my friend came here for the first time the other night. They have a great selection of craft beer and a full bar on top of that. Their food was very good. If you are in pittsburgh I would definitely recommend checking this place out! A++++"}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better is a good way to think of this place. I am not saying that it is terrible but it is new and maybe they need to figure out a few things before I come back again. I was really excited to come here because who doesn't like tacos? I met a date here that also has a penchant for tacos and we were just expecting more. 

First, the service was iffy. The server didn't know the menu and didn't have a lot to say about the food or the question I had about the specific menu items. I mean, they are new so that might come with time...but at least know some of the marinates used for the meats! Or to give an idea about how the margs are made. I don't know. Blah... And when the food was brought to the table it was just plopped down and the server just walked away. No here it is or anything about which taco was which. This also happened with drinks. The drink was behind the back dropped off at the table while the server was talking to another table. Just not the attention or goodness that I expected from a new place. 

The happy hour specials prices are good. If they can get their stuff together then, I would want to go back. The margs were $3.00 and the tacos $2.00. That is pretty awesome and it lured me in. BUT the margs were $1.00 more if you wanted a flavor. I picked a mix of strawberry and blackberry. NAHHH I should have went plain. These were too too too too too syrupy. I had to cut it with some of the water that I also got for the table. All that I tasted was that sweet syrup and nothing like a marg. Boo...for sure boo. I wonder if they would be a little stronger for after happy hour prices, but that is for another day.

The build your own tacos are the only ones for $2.00. Not a bad price at all. I liked the marinated portabello mushroom taco. It was great. I liked everything that I added on and I was happy that I could pick unlimited toppings for my taco. That was pretty great! I would go back just because I was not charged for more things that I wanted with my meal. The brisket taco was not good though. I was not impressed with the taste, texture, or anything about it. I thought it tasted like I bit into a beef jerky stick. I was surprised that brisket could taste like that and the meat was also in one big clump in the middle of the taco. BLAH. 

I think that this might be growing pains? Or new place pains? I am hopping for the best. I really would like a nice spot to go to that has a good taco and marg happy hour. I want them to be good. I just hope that they get everything together before I write them off all together. 

I might go again. But maybe a few months from now."}
{"text":"I ended up getting the worst case of food poisoning from the taco I ordered. Not sure if the food was prepared poorly or if there was some other issue. I was really disappointed because the food actually tasted good, but I definitely won't be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is my new happy place. Food is amazing. My only complaint is how cramped it can get there, because it is always packed."}
{"text":"Like the idea of fill out your own sheet to Build Your Own Taco.  They have a variety of taco shells but not the softer corn shell that most real Mexican places have, Wish they did.  It took us awhile to figure out what options we wanted on our Tacos.  Had some chips and gauc. The gauc. was a little on the sour side but still enjoyed it.  I had two tacos, one with the hard corn tortilla with chorizo and some other toppings and a flour with shrimp ceviche and some toppings.  Really enjoyed both.  Both had some nice flavors and little kick to them.  Of course your salsa and sauces options can really heat things up, but I stuck to some of the milder/medium options.  Our orders came out pretty quickly.  The system they have seems to work well. The tacos are $3 but some of the add on items do have an UP Charge.  
We sat at the upstairs bar and our bartender was great.  She was really busy since it was a very crowded and noisy place.  Drinks were good too."}
{"text":"I will be thinking about this place every day until my next business trip. I'm usually wary of Mexican places- anyone can make a Taco. But holy cow- these were AMAZING! I had the goody goody with chicken and I could not get enough. They're as addictive as Taco Bell but as decadent as an upscale eatery. The restaurant and menu is trendy and unique but it won't disappoint. 10/10 recommend for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"I was just here again last night, prior to going to the comedy club for improv night. I have to say this is my favorite taco place in Pittsburgh. Their proportion to price ratio, fresh tasting ingredients and choices are so good. 

Last night, I had a dinner with a vegetarian and I should mention that they were very please with their options for ordering. We split the queso (w/ corn) and were very pleased.  

I also got the surf n'turf taco as well as the Dutch Dragon. I get the Dutch Dragon every time, I absolutely loved all the vegetables and fresh tasting combination with both the hard and soft shells.  You can build your own, but I love Condado's suggestions and have yet to get one I did not like. 

Atmosphere: It is a little loud, so if you are looking to have a serious in depth conversation it may not be your best option, especially on weekends. 

Service: I've always had great service there and the staff is always on top of things and keeps things moving so even if there is a line out the door on weekends. The wait was only 20 min last night and they text your cell phone when your table is ready so we walked around downtown for a little bit. 

Happy Hour: Although I was not there for happy hour last night, it is a place I frequent. Their tacos (downstairs only) are all $1 off and you can get $3 margs (including their special vs the original). If we want tacos for happy hour, this is without a doubt the place we will go."}
{"text":"Best. Tacos. In. Town. Hands down. Did I just rhyme? I mean it when I say Condado is never a let down. This is probably our sixth time here since it's open and not once we're we disappointed. There happy hour is unreal. $1 off tacos, $1 off drafts and half priced on all margaritas. More taco combinations than any person can comprehend and the tastes and flavors to go along. If you don't ever read another review take my advice and get to Condado ASAP. You'll thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"Went for lunch yesterday at around noon with a friend. Service was good, chips and salsa was tasty and tacos were even better. Will be back."}
{"text":"The tacos were awesome and reasonably priced... but the real reason to go is a margarita! I had both banana and blackberry and they were exceptional.  I come down to Pittsburgh for work a couple of times a year and I will definitely be back here next"}
{"text":"Their tacos are amazing!! Some of the best I've had. Queso and margaritas were also delicious! Atmosphere is very fun and the wait staff was very pleasant. They also have really good happy hour deals during the week!"}
{"text":"After graduating from college in the Pittsburgh area, I think Condado Tacos is the place I'm gonna miss the most. It truly is a taco eatery in a league of its own. First off, I LOVE that condado has solid vegetarian protein options, rather than most taco places which just have a singular options. Here, you can choose from Thai chili tofu, pulled jackfruit, mushrooms, or even rice and beens. My personal favorite is the tofu, which is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Next, you can choose from pre made tacos or build your own. Normally, I build my own so that I can put all the toppings and sauces that my heart desires. Another unique aspect is that condado has double shell tacos, with one soft and one hard, plus other fillings like quest and gauc, without costing extra! Normally, I can get two very filling tacos for under $10 here. 

At happy hour, there are margherita deals and $1 off tacos. Another cool thing that condado offers is the option to mix two flavors in your margherita, like strawberry-mango, etc. 

Honestly, I could go on and on raving about this place but you should go check it out for yourself :)"}
{"text":"I do not understand the appeal at all. Sure, the margs are cheap and the alcohol pours may be heavy-handed, but the tacos are disgraceful. I rarely spit food out once it is in my mouth, but the ceviche-inspired shrimp taco was quite possibly the worst I have ever had. The shrimp taco was sweet, sour and the sauce tasted very thick, a very inappropriate combination in a taco. 

Another problem was the unnecessarily confusing taco menu. I found myself sorting through a pile of oddly-shaped menus to figure out my dinner.

It is a shame, because this restaurant is in a fantastic location and features a vibrant and colorful addition to Downtown Pittsburgh. I am willing to try again if they can get their act together and cook proper tacos. At least the chips are cheap and satisfying."}
{"text":"Such a hit or miss anymore... I used to be so excited to come here, but the past two times. Womp womp womp.... Nothing super special...The service is pretty awful and I don't think it is the servers' fault. They seem to get stacked with such large sections and that is not their fault. The tacos are obviously good, but the timing of the apps and tacos are awful. The tables are so tiny you can't even fit it all, that's after we had the hostess take away the wooden contraption. I tried their red pepper & pineapple marg, the presentation was sooo pretty. But, the taste. I was not a fan... I even love fresh squeeze juices, so I thought I would have loved it, not really. I took a few sips and couldn't do it anymore. Our server was so busy, I couldn't even order something else. 
My favorite part of my trip? The dirty sauce, I do not know what's in it that makes it spicy, but I'm obsessed!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way to greyhound station and am so happy I did! Great service, great drinks, and delicious tacos! I especially loved the El Santo and Babba Kush tacos. Babba Kush was so good I ordered seconds. Incredibly reasonable prices for the amount of food they serve. Highly recommend and would go back when visiting Pittsburgh again!"}
{"text":"I am always excited to try a new taco joint especially one that is vegetarian friendly. We came on a Friday night and it was crowded. We were seated downstairs and it was very loud. My friends and I could barely hear each other. Also, it was very dimly lit. 

I did like the customization aspect of Condado. I could pick everything from the shell, protein, toppings, and sauce. I also liked that they did not have a limit on toppings or sauces. I had a sweet lucy shell, which I highly recommend. It is a soft flour tortilla, queso, and then a hard shell. I had mushrooms, corn salsa, cilantro and onion, and a cilantro lime aioli. They do not skimp on the toppings as my tacos were overflowing. My second taco was a goody goody taco with the bbq jackfruit, jicama slaw, salsa, and chipotle crema. I have never had bbq jackfruit and it was on the sweeter side, so I am glad I had a lot more spicier toppings to cut the sweetness. 

Overall, for the food I give four stars. I enjoyed my tacos. My proteins were not warm, so then my overall taco really wasn't that warm. Also, my friend thought that their chicken was very bland and my other friend could not even eat her tofu taco. The floor was also very dirty and our table was sticky, so Condado has some work to improve on. But I will be back for the tacos!"}
{"text":"Affordable, good food and decent margaritas with a great vibe."}
{"text":"Management sucked. Food was good. But if there is a problem don't complain because they won't help you."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch, they were receiving people at door very professionally. I sat at bar and filled out the order slip , 1st I ordered two nachos. The waitress at the bar pointed out that nachos are too big and man she was right. That nachos was huge and rich . I changed my order to one taco and only one nachos , food came out pretty quick .it was delicious and very fresh .
I totally recommend it ."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour with my roommate and girlfriend and I was very impressed with the tacos/service. The tacos were well above average, our waitress was very helpful, and the bill was low. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Well worth the wait if there is any. Create your own tacos and excellent queso dip. Good selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!  Busy, but worth the wait!!!  

There is a bar and some tables upstairs, and then a bar and even more tables on the main floor.  It can be a little loud, but its a crowded spot, so that is expected, and the downstairs is a little dark, but its a fun, hip, modern dia de los muertos style atmosphere; the dim lights and the loud music is by no means a negative either, it just adds to the vibe of the restaurant.  

Great tacos, margaritas, and guacamole!  I highly suggest the pineapple guacamole, it was so delicious with the sweetness of the pineapple playing with all of the other flavors, and the chipotle honey....I wish I had some right now!  The tuscan was also super delicious, but the pineapple was my absolute favorite, I wish I knew how to make it like this place, because I am salivating just thinking about it!

I love the idea of building your own tacos with a check off system,  but they also have taco suggestions, so you don't have to build your own of you don't want to. 

My one coworker and I went upstairs for a drink and guacamole while we waited for others to arrive.  we sat at the bar, and once our friends came, we went downstairs for dinner.  

I was with a pretty good size group (about 5 people) and we all did the build your own tacos and had margaritas. We also ordered the tres amigos with a salsa, a queso, and a guacamole.  We had worked a long day, and it was the last day of our work trip, so we were celebrating. My coworker and I were so excited to come here, that we made sure we ate light all day so we could eat as many tacos as possible!   Everyone enjoyed the food so much, we had wished we had time to come back again and again!  I know I will come back next time I am in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican place right now!  Great tacos, cool vibe, friendly/knowledgeable bartenders and fun music.  I do think they have too many menus and it can be a bit confusing if it's your first time there."}
{"text":"Obsessed. They have plenty of vegetarian and even vegan options!! It doesn't cost a fortune for a taco and they are more than filling! I would pick a condado over tako, Bakersfield, or the other \"trendy\" over priced taco joints in the city that offer very few options."}
{"text":"Did not know what to expect when we walked in for dinner as we happened to walk by one night. The create-your-own tacos were great. A lot of different choices and combinations. Veggie friendly. The tacos we ordered were pretty large and very filling. They tasted great.  Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"My husband was visiting Pittsburgh and came here a few months ago..he literally called me right after to tell me about how great the tacos were and how he HAD to bring me here. We came on a Friday evening, this place was BUSY...it is extremely popular, however I must say that the wait wasn't that long. 

I very much enjoyed my tacos (I think I enjoyed the ones I 'built' myself rather than the pre-done ones already on the menu). I won't even bother to specify what I had because I had several (and am ashamed) and I think you'll be happy with whichever you choose. The sangria is ok, not to toot my own horn but I think I can make better at home...also the pitcher is of poor value because it was mostly ice. 

Some negative points to note: 
There are no fish taco options 
You cannot order the refried beans without bacon (my mother in law is vegetarian and was really disappointed by this) 
The service really is not that great, I do have to echo what I saw some others have said here. I took away a star for the service: our server was not attentive to the table, we had to ask for water and even then it took 20 minutes from someone to bring it...of course when we asked for the check, they brought that SUPER quickly :/"}
{"text":"I have been here three times and will keep going back.  Lunch the first week that they opened was crowded and the service was spotty.  We had a party of 5 and 4 of us got exactly what we ordered.  The one who didn't had his lunch comped by the manager so he didn't mind.  Returned for Happy Hour on Cinco de Mayo.  Tough to beat 1/2 price margaritas so it was no surprise that they were packed, especially that day.

They claim to have over 30,000 combinations.  It will take me a while to try them all but I will make an effort.  The queso was very good and so were the chips, but they tend to flake easily so you are left with a basket of crumbles.  Tried the chorizo and the brisket tacos.  Both were good, not great.  If you try something and don't like it, then you have plenty of choices for the next visit.  The menu gives you an idea on the heat of the salsa so you can dial it up as hot as you want it.  Maybe next time I will try the ghost pepper sauce.

Hopefully they will get their service issues worked out shortly."}
{"text":"Don't let the three stars drive you away, this is almost always a perfectly nice place to go for a lunch if you work downtown. 

I would recommend getting there early. Not that it always fills up, which sometimes it does, but it's best to get in before the servers get too busy. The difference between 11:30 and 12:00 can be night and day. 

There are tons of options from type of shell, to none, to proteins and toppings and sauces and salsas.

And mostly they're perfectly fine. I don't think I've had a single thing here's that's wow'd me and made me order it over and over, but even the strangest combinations will not disappoint. 

Also a word to the heat seekers out there, none of the ghost peppers stuff on the menu is very spicy."}
{"text":"A true disappointment. I completely agree with the other reviews suggesting they revise their menus into something more cohesive. Additionally, yes, it is an extremely tight space with very small tables. 

Anyways. The biggest let down were (you guessed it!) the tacos! I mean, COME ON. if you're gonna specialize in literally ONE type of food -- you gotta get it right! (Insert that \"they had one job\" joke here) 

Condado definitely missed the mark for me. I ordered the brisket tacos with cilantro and onions, slaw and lettuce. These were borderline disgusting. There was hardly any meat on it. A tablespoon is a generous estimate. Next, it was served fresh out of the refrigerator! Not even room temp, but completely cold. Zero seasoning or flavor and smelled like dog food. 

The cilantro and onions were barely noticeable, and I'm almost certain they just forgot the slaw because there was hardly anything else on it except for some soggy lettuce. Finally, I got a side of rice for $1 -- served in those tiny little black containers most restaurants use for condiments. That is also a tremendous waste and laughable. Basically a little shot of rice. Cool. 

My one time experience here made Taco Bell look like a three Michelin Star establishment."}
{"text":"This place was a little disappointing after hearing good reviews. 

My girlfriend and I came for Happy Hour and an early dinner. We were sat upstairs only to find out that Happy Hour deals are only offered downstairs. Not a good start. We started with chips and the chorizo queso. This was the best part of the meal. The chips are house made and the queso had tons of chorizo! Delicious. That was about the end of delicious. We made our own tacos which is such a cool, fun idea. I got a brisket taco and a pulled pork taco. The soft shell came right out of a bag from a grocery store which was a little disappointing. The meats were both unseasoned and bland and the brisket was very dry. The sauces, salsa and toppings were very flavorful which saved the taco. The rice and beans (served in extremely small portioned cups) were also very bland and again the rice was bland.

This place has a lot of potential if they can improve the product they're serving to people. It's a great location and I love to see downtown Pittsburgh growing. The environment is also very hip and trendy. I'm hoping this was a single bad experience. I'll be back to try again."}
{"text":"Love the food. I had steak tacos on juju soft/hard shells. Very good. The margarita were very good. Happy hour specials are great!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials! 1/2 price margaritas. Blood orange margaritas are the bomb! Jackfruit tacos are awesome. Great brunch too!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos with a very nice selection of options for meat, shells, and general toppings."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night with a friend to try the much talked about tacos. I'll be candid and say that I was not a fan of this place for 3 reasons: 1. The tacos are mediocre. I'm a pretty tough critic because my comparison is living in Austin, TX for 4 years, in the land of tacos. The meat in both my tacos was cold when it arrived. We also ordered queso and chips and the cheese congealed even before we paid the bill (there is a way that the queso gods make it that doesn't congeal...I don't know what it is, but I've had it) 2. The ordering system is less than ideal. They give you two columns of filling in open bubbles for what you'd like...the problem is, that doesn't allow you to order multiple tacos of different ingredients. I had to choose 2 tacos and pick exactly what shell, filling, and topping I wanted. Or I had to write the quantity in the open box for the same exact taco. This is limiting. 3. The space itself is SO tiny. I was practically eating at the tables of other people and in their conversations.  The wait staff had to squeeze by every single table when running to and from the kitchen. I can imagine this bothers them, so it has to bother the eaters at their establishment. 

I think with a change in the menu, some alterations of seating, and some study of better ingredients this place could be better, but I'm just not sold."}
{"text":"The first time I was at Condado I went for happy hour, but I went upstairs and apparently happy hour was only valid downstairs. No one told me this so I ended up paying full price for my margs. Regardless, the margaritas are amazing - get the blood orange!! And the tacos are to die for. If you read this review before you go for happy hour, don't forget to go to the downstairs bar for it!!!!"}
{"text":"The tacos and service were great. Nice Happy Hour vibe. The crunchy taco shells are made fresh."}
{"text":"For sure my new favorite taco spot downtown! We stopped in Sunday night around 1030 and the place was packed. Still, we got seated right away which was great and unexpected. 

Our waiter came quickly and offered us drink menus. He suggested the blood orange and prickly pear, which we both tried. I thought the prickly pear was a little too sweet, and coming from me, that means the drink must've been really sweet. My boyfriend had the blood orange which I enjoyed more - it had a nice tang to it that balanced out the sweetness.

The queso though. I would go back for just the queso any day. We got the dirty queso which had black beans, chicken, and a smoky spicy sauce. It ranks up there in one of the best quesos I've had, and came with plenty of fresh chips too. 

I opted to make my own tacos, and tried two of the special shells. The tacos were absolutely stuffed with toppings and sauces, all of which were free of charge! I really liked the chorizo and the shell with retried beans stood out too. 

Definitely will be back to try more taco combinations and margaritas!"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in to Condado, you can tell you're going to have a great experience. The art is edgy, the music always on point, the wait is short and the staff friendly and helpful--even though the place always seems to be packed, and the food and drinks are all spectacular. 

As a vegetarian, it can sometimes be difficult to find good variety at restaurants, but I've been here a couple of times, haven't ordered the same thing twice, and have loved everything I tried. The queso and guacamole both rank easily among the best I've had, the tofu and jackfruit are well-seasoned and perfectly cooked, and the margaritas and horchata are killer.

Build some tacos, drink some margs, be a happy camper. Lather, rinse, repeat."}
{"text":"Is it just me or has there been a huge surge in taco joints downtown recently? But who can complain about more tacos! I stopped in on a Tuesday because Taco Tuesdays are a weekly holiday for me. The ordering style is similar to a Burgatory or Stack'd where you bubble in your order on a scantron-like form. 

We started off with the trio of dips - guac, queso, and salsa. The chips are made in-house which was great because they're fresh but not so great because they were drenched in oil and lathered in salt. When it came to the main entrees, I give them props for having not one, not two, but THREE vegetarian proteins - tofu, mushroom, and jackfruit. The sauce on the tofu was delicious, but the chewy, jaw crushing tofu was a no-no. The jackfruit texture was better on the jaws, but it tasted overly sweet. All of the additional sauces you can throw on your taco are SPICY, holy cow. I'll admit that I'm not the best with spicy foods, but if there's 1 flame next to sauce on the menu, I'm expecting a light touch of spice, not a smack in the face. I never knew I could sweat that much from a taco. 

Service was very spotty since we came in during the happy hour specials. Our waiter was great, very personable, but as the time went on, he would be too busy with other tables to check in on us at all (which sucks when your mouth is on fire and you're begging for a refill). Taste-wise, Condado didn't do it for me. I was very disappointed with both tacos that I got and even the chips & dip appetizer. Unfortunately, a 2/5 for me."}
{"text":"The prices here are insanely good! Especially during happy hour (mon-fri 5-7)!

Came here for the first time yesterday! Tacos were $1 off and all drinks were half price. Being a vegetarian, I decided to build my own tacos. I picked out the portobellos and the BBQ jackfruit. Both were super delicious! And $4 for both! 

We also shared two different types of guacamole: traditional and pineapple. Both were very good! And $6 each so very economical. 

For drinks we all had two margaritas! I tried the peach and mango. Both were delicious! I liked the peach a little more. 

For the whole bill, it was $17! That's crazy! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I've frequented Condado Tacos many times, and everything about that place is excellent. The atmosphere is great, waitstaff is friendly, and the food is amazing. For appetizers, I've tried the salsa verde, salsa rojo, and guacamole (not pictured). All three are very good, but one of the best things at Condado is their chips. The tacos are gourmet and food truck esque as they are nearly wrapped in foil. I know I'll never be disappointed when I go there!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Excellent atmosphere, excellent food, and excellent service! (Julia). Super cool idea- build your own tacos and they have a bar!"}
{"text":"I am beyond impressed. I think it's rare that you have a good thing going right out of the gate. Granted, they've tested this already in their successful counterpart in Columbus, but dang, these are some good tacos!

The concept is build your own tacos. So you fill out a form for exactly what you want your taco to be. Flour or corn tortilla? Double stacked with gauc inside?? Dorito taco... Okay I made that last one up, but seriously the options are endless with meats, cheeses, toppings and sauces. The works! So it's really your fault if you make a bad taco! Although I would be hard pressed to find one I didn't like. I built one with their house made chorizo and fresco sauce and it was incredible. The other steak one I built was pilled high with chipotle cheese. Just thinking about them makes my mouth water. 

We also got chips, which are freshly baked and fried in house with two types of salsa (house and verde) and the queso with beans. The only miss was that the queso was really runny, so it made picking up the sauce with chips hard. But it still tasted good somehow, just messy!

The service was top notch and I love the vibe. Can't wait to make this my go to happy hour and taco spot... I feel like this is just the beginning of a beautiful relationship make in taco heaven!"}
{"text":"The food is not comparable to some other similar restaurant close to it. The margaritas also aren't great...the staff treated me like I was an inconvenience."}
{"text":"Helpful staff, amazing apps, and the tacos are so good!! So many options you get lost in it! 
Happy hour prices are good but the downstairs seating area is louder than a Pens playoff game!! 
Doesn't stop me from coming back all the time though!"}
{"text":"We chose Condado as the dinner place for my husband's birthday with a couple of his friends because who doesn't love tacos?! We definitely were not disappointed. They don't take reservations so we walked in and the wait was long, but we didn't mind because there was a bar :) In fact, there are two! One downstair and one upstairs; the upstairs one seemed larger. So we left our name and went upstairs and ordered a pitcher of Strawberry Margaritas and their Traditional Jalapeno Guacamole. The pitcher served about 6 glasses and were perfect! Not to sugary or watered down like other places make, but not too strong with the taste of cheap tequila! You could taste both the mix and the alcohol = two thumbs up! The guac was great and smooth and their chips crispy. After who knows how long, we sat down and started our fun journey of building our own tacos with the check list. Two people in our party picked from their pre-selected tacos and the other four built their own. It building your own was overwhleming at first glance, but super exciting as I looked down the list. It is nice to be able to order two different tacos with two different flavor themes! I made one with the beef brisket and a spicy theme (using the other toppings) and the second one with the BBQ jackfruit (they ran out of shrimp ceviche) with a fresh theme. Both turned out AMAZING. A good taco starts from the outside and being able to get a soft AND hard shell ensures you don't miss out on any texture! All the ingedients were great and the two tacos were huge! My husband had to help me finish them! And to think... they were both under $5 each! Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was super friendly but not overbearing. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because our table was sticky, which was annoying as we were there. But, we will definitely be back. Super affordable, delicious, and convenient for all appetites!"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. It is where the old Tonic restaurant use to be. They have remodel and spent a lot of time painting murals on the walls. I is all very well done. It gave me a feeling that I was celebrating the Mexican holiday Dia de los Muertis. Day of the dead.  I liked it. 

We started with an appetizer trio. The cheese dip was heavily. I could have taken a bath in it. I was not that impressed with the guacamole. Seemed store bought. 

I had two tacos that I built my own. I tried one with the peezler and sweet Lucy tortillas. For protein I tried the brisket and chicken.  The brisket is everything they claim it to be. I will definitely be ordering all brisket next time. The chicken was good.  

If you are downtown definitely check this place out"}
{"text":"Condado Tacos is a veg-head's oasis in the veggie food dessert of Downtown, Pittsburgh. 

It's like the Burgatory of Taco Places - get a notepad and pencil, and start building your own tacos. The amount of options to choose from are INSANE! However - I really love their BBQ jackfruit. 

They are also surprisingly fast at serving up your food, no matter how busy it is. I work at the Convention Center, and have gone during the lunch rush for a To Go order, and only had to wait 15 min. I have gone on a dead Saturday, and waited like 5min. This is amazing, if you only get a 30min lunch break. 

The staff has always been super nice and helpful, and the decor is also fun and funky to look at. Maybe there is a bit of inspiration from Mad Mex's decor...? Either way - it's always fun to look at colorful skulls and cartoonish characters when eating Mexican. 

I need to bring other people here; but since I come for my lunch break, I haven't had the beauty of sharing this place yet. They do have a loyalty program; and they are also involved in Yelp's cashback program. Overall - 5 stars because they win for having MULTIPLE veggie options, their staff is super great, and it's bright and fun inside. Not many other places in Downtown can boast that."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food! Great for after-theater nosh because it's open late, but it's a bit cramped & noisy like any bar might be on a Saturday night. The queso, fresh chips & tacos were all yummy! Go with a basic cocktail from the menu...this is not a place for refined cocktail connoisseurs."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on a Tuesday evening. We both had tacos, mine was chicken with the cilantro /lime aioli. My husbands had the house made chorizo on it . Both were great!! Chips and salsa were fresh and home made.
Service was fast and friendly.
It is a little loud! But a lot of fun!!"}
{"text":"Finally, after hearing so much about this place I paid it a visit. The service was dynamite, wish I caught the gents name, but he was a great bartender and really attentive. The margarita is a little too sweet for my taste, but okay nonetheless. Queso with black beans was really good, extremely flavorful. Tacos... Little disappointing. I got the fried corn shell with tofu and wasn't a fan. Tofu was over fried as well as the shell. Obviously it was fresh, but one bite and the whole thing crumbled. Thankfully they give you a spork. Next was the shredded jackfruit, which was decent. I've read reviews where people have said the tacos are really packed with ingredients and totally worth the price, I didn't get that. It wasn't expensive, but they were minimally stuffed. 

It's a nice, hip place that downtown needed. Really glad to have it. Only downside is that there isn't a lot of room to move. I sat at the bar and had to sit like a T-Rex with my elbows shoved to my side. Oh and it's loud."}
{"text":"We were one minute late for our reservation and they gave our table away. We had to wait in the hot pittsburgh sun again just to not get served."}
{"text":"Condado Tacos is a great restaurant.  I've gone 4 times over the past 2 weeks.  It's definitely budget friendly, with really tasty suggested tacos, but my favorite is the Create your own tacos.  Starting at $3, they allow you to customize your taco from shell to sauce, the whole enchilada.  You can easily get away with eating in for $10-$15.  The margaritas looked really good too (and cheap), but haven't yet indulged on that yet.  Also - they have a loyalty card that's gets you $5 back on every $50 you spend.  Happy hour takes a $1 off tacos and Margaritas, so you definitely can't go wrong (5-7PM)."}
{"text":"Disappointing. They have a really inclusive menu, but the food just wasn't good. The meat in the tacos (chicken/beef/even pulled pork) was inexcusably dry. They served all the corn tortillas our tacos were on cold(?!). The sauces were good, but tacos were under seasoned so I could hardly taste the sauces, this goes for made to order, and house tacos. I ordered a margarita, and it was in a highball glass, and waaay off on the lime:tequila ratio. And it wasn't lime, it was mix. 

Good tequila selection though. I would go here if I wanted to drink tequila, and eat corn chips with dips, but I wouldn't order tacos here again."}
{"text":"Good variety of flavors, great margaritas. The atmosphere is cool!"}
{"text":"tacos! Tacos! TACOS! The 412 taco scene has some new competition in town that is everything muy bueno. Stroll in to this corner spot and be transported to chic Mexico - Dia de los Muertos designed/stenciled walls; bar top tables and wooden bench booths; and a tequila lined wall behind the bar. The upstairs is roomier with another bar, so don't be alarmed by the intimate setting downstairs. Once you've settled in, it's time to play decision maker...and the options are limitless! Order some queso + housemade chips while you get your taco design on, but take heed and pace yourself! The Suggested Tacos menu will save you time and includes the El Tradicional (choice chorizo!), Surf 'N Turf (mad spicy yo!) and some solid vegetarian options such as the Dutch Dragon. Or choose your own adventure and start with your tortilla, pick your protein, and finish with toppings 'til your tickled pink. It sounds easy, but I dare you to stay focused! The options are not only extensive, but all fairly tempting. And did we mention the price?! Where else can you get a substantial, tasty taco for $3? Más tacos, por favor!"}
{"text":"This is a go - to spot to meet my friend for dinner and a few drinks. I've been there only around 6pm during the weekdays, but it's always VERY crowded. We like to sit at the bar, but it seems like for a table, there is not much wait on weekdays (10 minutes?).
I've always felt like the bartenders are friendly and talkative, even though they never stop moving! Beer/ liquor selection is unique but not intimidating. They're signature cocktails are fresh tasting, not overpowering in any department. 
The food here is really the main event, though. I'm convinced that no matter what you eat here, you will not be disappointed! Fresh vegetables and house - made salsas and verdes, juicy meats, and a TON of food for the prices! I ordered the tortilla fritos with ghost pepper steak, and had enough to save for lunch the next day! And it was $7!"}
{"text":"Heaven, bliss, nirvana!!! I love their tacos and the decor. My favorite tacos in pgh are at condado. Must get the Double shell with hard/soft and Thai tofu with spicy salsa!!!  Their queso is addicting and drinks are strong!"}
{"text":"Tacos, Margaritas, and guacamole!

Condado is a wonderful new option for tacos and brunch in downtown. A colorful vibrant interior and friendly staff will greet you. Seating is available in the bar area, upstairs dinning room, and some tables set up outside that allows you to enjoy the energy of downtown and is especially great when anthrocon is in town. 

The menu is tacos, guacamole and dips, and a few salads. This is not a full Mexican restaurant but what they do they really do well. They offer a wide selection of specialty tacos and a create your own tacos option. The create your own has a wide variety of options. They have several stuffed taco shells that are a soft tortilla and crunchy shell sandwiched with toppings like cheese, beans, bacon, and guacamole. I definitely suggest trying one of those options.  I had the Ju-Ju shell stuffed with chorizo and queso  and it was amazing. 

Speaking of queso this place has several queso options but the Dirty Queso with chicken, beans, and the wonderful Dirty sauce (that dirty sauce should go on everything). Plus guacamole and salsa.

They also have a wide selection of Margaritas, tequilas and beer. I suggest a Margarita sampler to start but you can just dive into a pitcher if you like. 

I will be back at brunch!"}
{"text":"Food *****, Drinks *****, Service *****, Value *****, Atmosphere *

Made Party of 15 reservations for Saturday 7pm (I know, I know, PRIME TIME in a new restaurant...what was I thinking?) No table available. Sat us at upstairs bar (one member of our party can't do stairs :o(, so they left) Mgmt comped us chips and guacamole for the inconvenience. Table opened after about 50 minutes. By then several others also left because it was so packed and LOUD they just didn't want to be there anymore. 10 of us squeezed into a super booth where we ordered food. Bartender Mike was our AWESOME server. Staff was great, it's just really REALLY cramped, busy, and loud. Oh, and it's really loud too. Tacos are INCREDIBLE. Margaritas are FABULOUS. Prices are crazy reasonable. But it's really LOUD. 

Bottom line: Go eat there! Just not at 7pm on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"The food was great. It is self service, so you'll have to grab a pad of paper to create your own taco.  Try the non meat options like the mushroom, it was delicious. The spicy taco shell wasn't as great. However their guac was amazing! Dont miss out on it and they give you a lot of it, but you need to ask for it because it is not on the menu. Grab a seat at the bar because there is no wait. On the con side the bartender had a terrible attitude, acted put out each time I asked a questions, never asked me for another drink or how I was doing, except to give me the check."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Be sure to plan accordingly because it gets packed. Perhaps it was extra packed because of Memorial Day weekend but I can imagine it being busy in a Friday night. We were able to get in right when it opened and sat on the second floor. The waiter immediately greeted us with water and asked if we wanted to start our Memorial Day off right with a shot of tequila We had to pass but they have an open bar for anyone wanting a drink or two. 

The way the ordering works is similar to ordering sushi. There are pads of paper that have a variety of ingredients from your tortilla to protein to salsas. 

They also have a pad of \"suggestions\" of taco creations. You can also make taco to go which they prepare after bringing your dine in order our. 

I will definitely be back to have the goody goody! It was delicious! I got that with one chicken and one brisket - sour cream, salsa and cheese. The goody goody comes with sour cream, guacamole and some crunchy goodness. Good thing they brought my order sheet back so I can share it. 

The service was good and the price was affordable."}
{"text":"The food at Condado was really delicious. They also had good prices on their drinks but my major complaint is that they were out of a lot of stuff. For every 5 whiskeys or tequilas My group and I tried to order they were out of 4 of them which was a bit frustrating. Also, the next day we went back for lunch and again the food was great but the bartender that helped us was not very friendly. I would recommend going for the food and drink options for sure and hopefully they get a shipment in soon!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and drinks. Prices are decent too. Relaxed and fun atmosphere. One of my favorites."}
{"text":"Their vegetarian tacos were out of this world. Some of the best Tacos I've ever had. I especially liked the one with pulled jackfruit. 

They also have a great tequila selection and interesting looking cocktails."}
{"text":"This place changed the level of enthusiasm I had for Tacos when anyone suggested tacos for lunch or dinner. I was here with my colleagues for lunch during a conference in downtown. I was intrigued by the interior and it did not stop there. Their menu is also unique. You can build your own tacos and the options are unlimited. The waiter who waited on our table is very patient and explained to us about filling out the menu card which requires some effort that is totally worth for the food they serve.

I ordered tofu in one of the tacos and I don't regret going for that unusual combination. The tacos are huge and I ordered 3 of them. Two with tofu and one with some regular fillings. They are delicious and I highly recommend the hard shell tacos. 

I should also mention that they are the most ergonomic tacos which are easy to eat without making a mess! Of course, I am going back again."}
{"text":"Went with too high of hopes for this new spot. Average tacos. Prices are a little high for what you get. Overall it was an okay experience and somewhat authentic tacos."}
{"text":"This was my second time at condado tacos but for some reason I forgot how good this place was. I like that you can make your own tacos from the different salsas, meats, and toppings that they have available. The service is great and the waiter was willing to explain how the ordering is placed on the paper by checking the boxes. It's a really simple, lively, and delicious atmosphere. I'll definitely be back when I'm in downtown for avenging meal."}
{"text":"Condado is your high school cafeteria's tacos served in the old Tonic, late and cheap. The underwhelming options are overwhelming in number. Kind of like if Taco Bell had booze and tried a smidge harder. It gets two stars because late and cheap are two things I usually am, too."}
