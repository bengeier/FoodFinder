{"text":"We have been there when it was titans 
It was very good and great service 
Then it changed to socialbles what a waste 
Service is the shits the waitress are horrible all they care about its talking and trying to impress the young guys give it up girls 
I bet your tips sucks 
We as regulars will not be back I think the owners should monitor there staff. 
And the food don't bother ordering not good at all."}
{"text":"I mostly agree with the other review except for the fact that I do think it has got better since it was Titans.  However they kept most of the same old Titans staff who think they own the place.   

Food is ok. But a tad overpriced.   Drinks are decently priced and a good selection of beer on tap.  

All in all.  An ok place to hang out for a drink and a bite as long as you get a competent waitress.   Don't get me wrong.  Most are great.  Some just seem to have the old 'Titans mentality'"}
{"text":"Reasonable bar but avoid it if you are sick or disabled. Was a regular for years and recently had a medical episode which was not alcohol related and did not affect any other customer or disrupt service. EMS was called but did not need to transport me. Staff now refuse to serve me  as they do not know my medical condition."}
