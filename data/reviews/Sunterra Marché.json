{"text":"I work near Bankers Hall and come to this Sunterra nearly every time I haven't brought a lunch with me. It's fast - if it's not the lunch rush I can get in and out and eat during a 15 minute break or if it's my 30 minute break I'll have tons of time to spare. The salad bar is by far my favourite it's cheap! And, really fresh and delicious with a lot of choices. 

A complaint: the lack of vegetarian options when it isn't the salad bar. Everyday they have two soup options and it would be nice if one of the two was always a vegetarian choice. Also more warm food vegetarian options would be wonderful."}
{"text":"I usually go to Sunterra in the morning to grab something small for breakfast - everything is always fresh! I also love wandering around this place because it's like a quaint super market in Bankers hall - a create your own salad bar, deli, bakery, etc

A few weeks ago, I got the BBQ chicken pizza for lunch. I love that it was thin crust, sauce was smoky and sweet, and the chicken was perfectly seasoned.

Seating is quite limited, but you're not far from the Bankers food court or the Devonian Gardens!"}
{"text":"A regular staple for hundreds of Calgarian everyday who need to buy lunch, Sunterra has been successfully satisfying its customers for years. This is an excellent option  is you are look for quick food that is a slight step up from cafeteria options in Banker's Hall. 

There are many health conscious options inside. Their baguettes are a nice grab and go option. Not to mention their desserts rarely disappoint. 

However as an individual who adheres to a primal/paleo diet, the salad bar is my oasis from a bread and cheese obsessed world (not that there is anything wrong with that). The options are immense from spinach to tuna to chicken to olives to eggs to dried cranberries to seeds. Just pick and choose and you are ready to go, so simple an Arc can handle it. There is even oil and balsamic vinegar available at hand if you are not interested is the dressing options at the bar. 

I forget the actual cost as they charge by weight,$1.69 per 100g. I usually pay around $8 for a very satisfying size of salad. This is reasonable price compared to other options nearby. 

A wonderful down-town option for all you primals/paleos out there."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a great place to pick up a meal that is fresh and healthy.

Often times I stop by for breakfast, and I will order some eggs, potatoes and sausage from the food bar in back.  The staff and food is always of great quality and it only takes a couple minutes to get my food and get on my way.

I also stop by Sunterra for lunch from time to time, and make myself a salad from their salad bar.  All of the ingredients are fresh and taste great, it's definitely one of the best salads I've eaten while in Calgary for work."}
{"text":"Sunterra is a great place to grab a healthy lunch if you happen to find yourself downtown."}
{"text":"Quick, fresh, and delicious lunches.

As you can see from my check-ins, I'm a big fan of this Sunterra location. It's very convenient to pop down to this location and grab one of their delicious salads and head back up to my office to keep working. There is very little seating here, so you will probably want to plan to be heading somewhere else to consume your selection. Even during the lunch rush, this place manages to serve everyone quite quickly. I recommend heading down there a little early (~11:45) if you want to avoid the lines, especially if you plan on building your own salad at the salad bar.

Small Sunterra Market that provides all of the essentials in a timely manner."}
{"text":"If I am in the downtown area and near the Bankers Hall food court then I head directly to Sunterra on the second floor.  I know that within the hour that I have allotted to eat at least I know I can get exceptional food very fast that is oh so tasty.

Let me give you a rundown of things I have had here, cheddar stuffed chicken, fresh herb roast beef, chicken cordon bleu, nibble cut pork chops, oven roasted yams, and chicken parmesan.  I mean this is only one tenth of the entree menu.  

Now there is the amazing salad bar and again just to quote a few; curry chickpea, broccoli and grape, marinated vegetable and ginger chicken pasta.

There is a huge assortment of beverages, from yogurt drinks, to soy drinks, to energy drinks, speciality teas and coffees and then of course the dessert area.

This is an exceptional fast food option in a very French marketish sort of feel decor; everything is weighed so make sure your stomach is not speaking louder than your appetite. But basically in a short period of time you come away with a simple gourmet meal at well less the price."}
{"text":"Sunterra is fantastic when it comes to lunch but I'm a little disappointed with how small this location is. Sunterra has great fresh food including sandwiches, salads, and pizza! I will always stop at Sunterra if I forget my lunch or need something quick, I just wish this location was bigger.

If you're going to stay and eat your lunch I recommend you don't go at lunch time (noon) because this place is packed so you likely won't find a place to sit!"}
{"text":"When you've got a hankering for some lunch in Bankers Hall and want something that isn't the food court, meander on up to Sunterra Market. 
I love stopping in to check out their salad counter... they've got one to create your own or one over near the back with premade salads. Today I'm enjoying the cherry tomato and bocconcini. I've also come out of here with some mighty tasty pizza.

If you're coming in the heat of the lunch hour rush, best of luck finding a place to sit. There are a half dozen cafe style tables lining one of the side corridors outside the market, but it's likely they'll all be full. Your second option would be to try out the benches facing the middle of the mall (if your food is easy to eat). Look to take your meal to go, or come visit them after the rush has subsided.

The side of my coffee cup is telling me that all of the pork and beef products come from Sunterra farms (which are all Alberta-based) and produce is shipped direct from growers' fields... did I forget to mention they have free wi-fi? Well, it's the wi-fi from the food court, but it works just as well right outside Sunterra."}
{"text":"Service was okay, but the desserts looked quite appetizing until u eat them and they taste blan and flavourless was disappointed since i really enjoy desserts"}
{"text":"My friend purchased \"beef on rice\" and ended up eating beef on spinach. Her spinach became soggy with her own tears as her life turned into an immediate downward spiral. 5 out of 5 would recommend sunterra again."}
