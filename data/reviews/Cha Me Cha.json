{"text":"Cha Me cha is a great tea shop and definitely underrated! I went there with my friend and we ordered a milk shaved ice and it was huge and full of toppings. I'm  soo surprised it was only around $6 and I really appreciate how fairly priced everything on the menu was. These days tea shops can be really unreasonable with their proportions and pricing so I'm glad I gave here a try.  Also try their brewed teas!!"}
{"text":"New BBT place was giving out free drinks during their grand opening if you checked in using FB.  There were only 2 people in line despite the free drink promo which should have served as a warning to me.   My five minutes waiting in line should have been spent elsewhere as I threw out the drink a couple of sips in....tasted like watered down sugar water and tapioca was way overcooked."}
{"text":"Approximately three new bubble tea shops have recently opened in the Yonge/Finch area, and I had the opportunity to try Cha Me Cha last night.   To truly get a taste of how good their milk tea is, I always order the original flavor. I can't speak for other flavors, but the Original was very bland and powdery. Even though I asked for less ice, the milk tea still tasted very watered down.   We had a hard time getting the waitress' attention. They seem to be gossiping about something in the back, so we waited for ten minutes to order after the giggling ended.   I do find their shaved ice very appealing, as you don't find that often here in Toronto. Maybe I'll give that a shot next time, but their drinks are very disappointing."}
{"text":"your typical BBT place with taiwanese desserts and food. They have some lunch combo deals that alright I guess. Not a very memorable experience. I'd probably not go back."}
{"text":"I have heard many great things about Cha Me Cha from other people in the past, so I decided to go check it out for myself.  Cha Me Cha is a typical bubble tea spot where you expect to find various kinds of bubble tea, steamed tea, and Taiwanese snacks.   Although other reviewers of this place may have had unpleasant experiences, it did not happen on my visit with my friend.   The service was very decent as the waitresses were very pleasant and helpful in terms of the requests me and my friend had. We decided to try the Green Tea Wizard.  The presentation of the Green Tea Wizard was a bit lackluster, not looking like its comprehend on the menu, or pictures that I see other attendees have at the Markham location. But overall, the shaved ice had a lot of bright flavors as every bite was very enjoyable. The price for the shaved ice was worth the price as me and my friend barely finished the bowl.   Overall, this location is very small, but the bubble tea and desserts are worth looking past the small proximity of the location."}
{"text":"I had their honey milk tea and their red bean soup. The taste isn't as good as the other tea shops. Can do better. Only gave them 3 stars as suppose to give them 2 stars. We wanted to go to another tea shop but there were no more seats so we came here to Cha Me Cha. The seating is much better than ChaTime's. We waited a while before being served. But they have free wifi so that's great."}
{"text":"I was skeptical especially after being seated and reading the not so great reviews. I came here on a Friday night and it was packed, luckily there was one table left in the corner.  There was one server on that night, my friend and I had to repeat our order at least three times in order for her to remember. We ordered two drinks- Milk Tea with Grass Jelly and Red Bean and Japanese Green Tea Latte.  It is $1.00 to upgrade from 500ml to 700ml and $0.50 to add tapioca to your drink. The price range was pretty standard for a bubble tea shop, around $3.50-$5.50 depending on the drink of course.  The Milk Tea was powdery and was not very tasty IMO I have definitely had better. The grass jelly was large chunks and difficult to get without a spoon =_= My friend mentioned her Green Tea was okay but should have gotten something else.  Honestly, I wasn't that impressed with the overall atmosphere and felt the seating was limited. I mean the space looked pretty modern but I definitely would not come here for the bubble tea and I don't think there will be a next time. Quite disappointing. There are so many other bubble tea shops to go to, so I suggest going there instead."}
{"text":"Updated review: took off a star for the drinks. Drinks 2 star, shaved ice 4 star so I guess the average is 3.  Wintermelon green tea no wintermelon taste... Fig jelly no taste..Friends drink wrong order came. I thought the drinks were kind of pricey and watery. Won't be back for drinks anytime soon"}
{"text":"Saw a fellow yelper check into one of my favorite shaved snow places across the continent in Cali and it made me want some. I had it twice in my life, both times in California. So I went ahead to yelp a shaved snow location in Toronto. This place came up so I went ahead and tried it. Ordered 3 cups: Mango Tango (Mango) with mango jelly + mango balls + vanilla ice cream Purple Crystal (Taro) with sweet potatoes + fig jelly + condensed milk Ugly Duckling (Black Sesame) with mung beans and something else + condensed milk  The names are interesting. The ice is nicely shaved, comparable to what I tried in California and very fluffy. All 3 flavors (of the snow) were really good.  My favorite was mango. All of the toppings were great.  Purple crystal - fig jelly was very good but the sweet potatoes were very interesting. (not bad, not quite good either).  Ugly duckling - black sesame was great and usually one of my favorites, but the toppings just did not go with it.   4 for the shaved ice. I can't speak for their other food."}
{"text":"Great toasts and shaved ice. If you are looking for a light snack this would be the place to be. But, I wouldn't recommend their bbt though there are many other options on Yonge that you can choose from - too powdery to my liking. The environment cozy and quiet, a great place to hang out or study.   Service is not great but acceptable."}
{"text":"My friends got their mango tango snow ice and finished it before my other friend and I even got our green tea wizards. The mango tango was also melted at the bottom. I waited for more than 20 minutes for my green tea wizard and I got the last one. The server only gave us one order and said he ran out. My other friend had to sit there and order something else, watching the rest of us eat. Terrible.  Also, the portions here are not as big as the Markham location's.  Summary: snow ice tastes good, but the service here is terrible and the portions are mediocre at best. Go to the Markham location."}
{"text":"Love their milk tea with pudding! Unlike what the other reviews on here, it's really yummy! Tea was strong and one of the best teas I've tasted! Just hope I can sleep tonight after drinking it! The pudding was delish as well! Just didn't like their plastic lid covers instead of the sealed cups! As the plastic kids keeps dripping tea all over the table! Will be back to try their shaved ice! Wish they had the little mini white tapioca! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This location is so much closer to me than the Markham location, so I came here in search of some shaved ice. We got there around 2:30pm on a Sunday and it was closed? Whaat? Okay fine, it's Sunday, but come on Cha Me Cha! You're at Yonge and Finch! Every time you turn a corner there is 3+ dessert/bubble tea places selling the exact same things, so get on that. I was undeterred, I really wanted my shaved ice.  30 minutes later, we finally made it in the store and ordered the taro shaved ice, original milk tea, Taiwanese fried chicken - all the traditional regulars. A couple minutes later the waiter came by to tell us there was no taro toppings (no sweet potato, etc), so I ordered the sesame. Two minutes later, again, no toppings available for the sesame. So what DO you have? Green tea wizard? Okay. I'll still eat it because I thoroughly enjoyed the green tea wizard at the Markham location and food is food.  The last time I was at the Markham location, I essentially ordered the same things as we did at the uptown location. The Markham Cha Me Cha knocked it out of the park - huge portions, shaved ice toppings on the side in a beautiful display. The chicken batter was golden yellow and looked super delicious and crispy. Although the bubble tea was meh, it was decent enough that I still drank most of it. Fast forward to the one at Yonge, and the bubble tea was awful. The tapioca was so, so tough to chew it was like eating erasers. The bubble tea itself was very watered down and lacked flavour. The chicken was super dry, like Sahara desert dry. And everything on the green tea shaved ice was topped off in a sloppy display, with a smaller portion to boot.  For your dessert and bubble tea fix, make the trek to Markham and skip this location."}
{"text":"Their processing speed is super slow. All the foods are definitely microwaved. Also the waiters never see u calling them. Worst experience"}
{"text":"I should have known better than to expect much from food at a bubble tea place, but I figured I'd try it once.  The second warning was when they said rice was not available yet, since they're newly opened.  We ordered, amongst other things, a fried chicken leg, that came with a dollop of potato salad instead of rice.  The staff fumbled through putting the frozen chicken through the microwave and the deep fryer.  We got the result, black along one edge, and overcooked througout.  It's dark meat chicken, and it's been brined, but even that didn't save this chunk of meat from being dry, stringy and chewy.  They're brand new and just figuring things out, but what bugs me is that the dish was visibly burnt, and they didn't really seem to care about what they were serving their customers.  On the flip side their bubble tea was pretty good, and actually had good tea flavour. Just don't order the chicken."}
{"text":"The one in Markham is better, well at least my experience with there was. The space is also much smaller here. We ordered the Taro shaved ice, and it was a mistake. Maybe because it was just after I had eaten dinner, or maybe just because it wasn't very good at all. I struggled trying to make a dent in it. The taro shaved ice part was very good, but everything else in there (sweet potatoes, other mysterious ingredients) was so awful tasting. I've had the Green Tea and Black Sesame at the Markham location and finished every last bit of it. The presentation at the Markham location is also better, IMO."}
