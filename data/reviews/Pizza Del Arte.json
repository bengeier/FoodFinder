{"text":"The pizza here is top quality.  Thin crust, Napoli style.  Good service too.  You can't beat the quality.  It rivals any of the trendy eat in places that you'd be familiar with."}
{"text":"There you have it. Yes it was extremely delicious. Bacon and scallop pizza. I love Mandy, such an artist."}
{"text":"The pulled pork whiskey BBQ pizza is amazing.  The Margherita pizza is amazing.  the mushroom pizza...you guessed it.  Amazing.  I have not had a bad pizza from here.  I always do pick-up, so I have no experience with delivery, but they have always been quick and accurate for me.  Great little place!"}
{"text":"Top notch 'za, good service, excellent price. Highly recommend to anyone in the midtown Toronto area!"}
{"text":"Excellent new pizza joint.  Has replaced vesuvios as my go to pizza.  Love the selection on the boards and love that the guys running the oven appear to be very proud of their work.  what it lacks in price against the big pizza joints, it more than makes up in quality.  try it once, especially those living in the building.  you'll go back. :)"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for vegan pizza in the city! They have lots of vegan options both with or without Diaya cheese.  I have ordered pizza from here a few times. The latest order was an XL Ortolana pizza. I called it in for pick up and it was ready within 20 minutes.   The crust is pretty thin, I think if i could change anything it would be for a slightly thicker crust. If it stays the same though I'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"Great quality ingredients with gourmet toppings that you would order at a nice restaurant or bistro. Friendly and efficient service.   They even gave us free spicy garlic dipping the sauce the first time I went. The complimentary Kettlechips are better than the ordinary brands though probably not homemade.   Take out for a small pizza works out to be the best option as the pay-by-the slice section tends to be empty and you can get a fresh pizza in 20 mins. I like the Abruzzo (spicy Italian sausage) and the maple Hawaiian has huge chunks of real pineapple not from the can. Will def have to try the truffle pizza at some point!"}
{"text":"This is an unassuming little place tucked around the corner of a condo, so it's easy to overlook, but don't. The pizza is damn good.   There are a couple of small tables but it's more of a pick-up or delivery kinda place.  They're on Just Eat, or just go ahead and call em."}
{"text":"Great food .. But order fresh .. Walk In cheese or pepperoni special for $8 or the blackened pesto chicken .. Most days the Service is aweful ! Owner and most workers have a severe attitude problem . You never know if they are going to be in a bad mood or not ..Deters me from going in often ..but the pizza is good .."}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza here multiple times (in person, over the phone) and always have a great experience. The owner(?) is a little rough around the edges, but he works hard and knows his product, and the pizza has the taste to prove it! If you're pleasant, he's pleasant right back. From their menu I've had the Pollo BBQ, Deluxe and Abruzzo (done gluten-free) pizzas. ALL. AMAZING. You really can't go wrong! They make gluten-free with tapioca flour, a delicious option to try!"}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by high rating/, it just has not been reviewed enough times yet. (We have not tried their vegan pizzas so maybe those are better)  I have been holding off from reviewing this place because my first two experiences had only been with the slices, which usually taste like they have been sitting there for too long. But after giving the place a third chance and ordering two of the pizzas from the menu I can now say that I will make sure I never come back to this place.  Pros: - pick up orders are ready in as little as 15 mins - the place is rarely too busy (though that's probably not a good sign) - if you live upstairs it's an easy alternative to big chain pizza places - service is alright, though not as memorable as others make it sound. - we have been told sometimes they give you chips with your slice. This has never happened to us, and they have never even asked us to buy anything extra with our slices (not even pop)  Cons: - the thin crust is usually quite bland in taste - ingredients don't taste fresh, especially mushrooms and peppers from our experience (pizza pizza tastes fresher, which is saying a lot) - they say tomato sauce is made with San Marzano tomatoes. Though this might be true, sauce doesn't taste half as good as any other sauces that make similar claims from other pizza places on st Clair w.  Overall the place sounds great on paper, but it does not actually live up to expectations when it comes to taste, the most important thing.  Tip: you can do better with almost any other place on st Clair. Save your tastebuds from the bad taste experience."}
{"text":"Felt compelled to write a review as I live very close to this place and eat here quite frequently.  Pizza here is top notch - and takes approx 15 minutes to make if you call in to pick up.  Lots of different types of Pizza, I love the walk in special.   Staff and owner are all really friendly. I am a huge fan of Pizza Del Arte and would recommend to anyone around the area."}
{"text":"This is a really great pizza place! I live close by so I always order pickup and their pizza is consistently fresh and tasty :). I almost always go for their margarita and their cheese pizza - they have a great special if you order pickup - 6.99 for mediums I believe! The place is small, so not really great for eating inside unless you want a quick bite. There's a large table and some seating if you're waiting for your order. They deliver but I've never had delivery here so can't comment on that! But I can say their pizza is pretty darn good! The best around the area so definitely give it a try if you're nearby!"}
{"text":"Two stars for at least having a creative menu, otherwise this is a one star review.   I have ordered from here 5 times, yes fool me 4 times over. The first time my family ordered from there, the pizza was delicious, and the dough crispy.  We were so excited to find an awesome pizza place right near us. We ordered for a larger family event of about 12 people, with six kids. They sure made me look bad - delivery was late, even though they are three blocks away. Pizza was floppy and limp, and bland. The pizza was so limp that the toppings fell off. When you pull a slice from the box, the points frequently stayed stuck to the box, along with some toppings.  They also had a bunch of promotions on their site -when I asked about them, they were all \"expired\" even though there was no mention of a shelf life to the offers.   I kept ordering,  hoping they would go back to the way it was the first order. No luck. ALWAYS LIMP PIZZA, with mushy dough. Ordered yesterday, after a six month break - still limp, the marguerita for the kids and me, so completely bland that it could not even compete with some pizza pizza I had at a kids party a few weeks back. I wanted to order from a well reviewed panini place on st. Clair, but they were on vacation - that's why I went back to this lousy excuse for a pizza joint.  I have my doubts about the veracity of the 4 star Yelp rating this place gets.    You know what, one star."}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from here twice. Overall, two terrible experiences. The pizza is fine but it can't overcome the poor service from the delivery guy.  On the first occasion, I asked on the phone if they took visa. They said yes. When the delivery man arrived at my apartment building, he called my cell and told me to come down. I told him to use the buzzer number that I gave when I ordered, and to take the elevator to my floor.  After a bit of back and forth he finally agreed to deliver the pizza to me. (This was frustrating. Yeah, I'm lazy; but the Pizza Pizza guy doesn't complain about coming to my door and he's working against the clock on a 40-minute guarantee. What's the Pizza Del Arte guy's excuse? In fact no delivery person has ever refused to buzz up.) He got to my door and told me the price, and I handed him my visa. He said he didn't bring the machine and asked for cash. I had none. He insisted on using his cellphone to call the store (I hope!) and read out all my credit card details. This made me anxious, but I don't think my identity has been stolen yet. Calling in the number didn't work so he had to go to the store to pick up the machine. That sucked for both of us, but it had to be done. When he came back, he called my phone and told me to come down. I said no. He told me the visa machine doesn't work when you're a few floors above the ground. This sounded like baloney so I told him we should try it up here just in case it worked. (At this stage I was fairly certain that the dude just doesn't like the inconvenience of buzzing in and coming to my door. I don't live in the Burj Khalifa, and cellphones get signal just fine up here.) He came up, the visa machine worked without incident, and I was unhappy with the experience.  A couple months later, I decided to give them another chance. Same delivery guy. Similar experience. He called my cell and told me to come down because that's the only way the visa machine would work. I said no. He came up, was grumpy and ran my Visa card through the machine, no problem. But so much attitude.  The pizza comes with chips that are flavoured with rosemary. They're ok, I guess, but greasy, and certainly not enough to overcome the service.  Maybe the pizza is good when you walk in, but I don't ever want to *inconvenience* Pizza Del Arte's delivery man again."}
{"text":"I must admit, I think their primary business is through deliveries and as I went for take-out my review is somewhat lower. I had been eyeing this place for a while and finally had the opportunity to go today. The place is small with an open kitchen, ordering station and 3 tables. They have displayed slices (which are actually really good-sized squares) but the slices don't have any labels and they are so packed with toppings that you can't tell if something is vegetarian, spicy, doesn't include a certain topping etc.  Secondly, they have combos which are one of their slices, 'house-seasoned chips' and a pop. The chips are big-name chips (they don't hide this fact, the bags are in open view) with their own blend of seasonings mixed in. I'm mixed on this point, so I'll let anyone who reads this come to their own conclusions.  The pizza itself is packed with toppings, has minimal crust, is larger than most pizza places and cheaper in price so in terms of value it's quite good. Combos are also a fairly good deal but you have to let them know you want a combo as apparently it does not calculate it automatically (and I suspect I was overcharged). It's obvious their main source of income is through their deliveries and considering you know what your ordering it takes a lot of the guess work out of the experience. If I was in the area where they delivered I would probably order from here over some of the big chains because the value appears better but as a take-out place I probably won't be back.  Final thought: give them a try and see what you think, likely with the pizza you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 walk-in cheese pizzas and 2 dipping sauces which came to around $20. While the total price of $20 was very reasonable and the pizza maker was very friendly at the counter, the cheese pizza was average at best. The crust could've used more salt and the sauce and cheese were quite bland. I love giving new small businesses like this a chance over the chains but I'm not sure if I will return here"}
{"text":"Twice in a row, I called in a pick up order for their pepperoni pizza. Both times they said 20 minutes, I get there in 22 minutes and it's not ready? Then they say another 10-15 minutes? I stand there while people walk out with pizza, and get it 20 minutes later? DONE with this place!  Now the manager took the young server and roasted him and gave us 2 for 1. Hopefully never happens again?   Pizza still taste good."}
{"text":"Im a pizza fanatic. If you want to try one of the worst pizza joints in Toronto, on or south of Bloor, come here.  The slices were just over $4, and I could only eat the cheese.  Do remember, you have 3 pizza joints just north and to the west, on Bloor, west of Dundas west/Roncy (King Slice (pretty good), Keele Ur Hunger Pizza (avoid for the name), and 850 Degrees Pizzeria (have yet to try)) all within metres of one another, plus  Amato's (not to bad) just north of Bloor on Dundas West (north side of Dundas West Stn). No excuse for not being great."}
