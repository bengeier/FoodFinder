{"text":"High expectations for this new restaurant in our neighborhood.      Unfortunately, the food was highly disappointing.      My eggs were so overcooked they were almost inedible.   Props for putting turkey bacon on the menu."}
{"text":"DO NOT order online here. It has been more than two hours since we placed our order. We have a confirmation number for our order and were told by JustEat that we would be receiving our food in five minutes from calling and it has been another 40 since then. BreakFast Room claims they did not receive our order and that it didn't go through to them from JustEat. We have a confirmation number as mentioned and a supposed delivery time. Rather then offering to help or offering us anything, they told us to call JustEat. Once again, do not online order here."}
{"text":"Have dined here before and the food is fine, but they have made it clear to me that they do not care about their customers, so I won't be going back.  Tried to bring my daughter here for a birthday breakfast before school.  Checked their website for their hours, and arrived at 7am when they said they opened.  I waited until 7:10 - still no one was inside.  We couldn't wait any longer, so we had to scramble to make other arrangements and as a result of the time, we had to cut our breakfast short.  Restaurants should open when they say they will, but not the end of the world, assuming they would listen to feedback. They didn't.  I emailed the restaurant to express my disappointment, and when I didn't hear back in a week, I emailed again.  I still don't have a response.  It's pretty clear to me that the owners of this establishment aren't interested in their customers, so I'm done.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Good for a lazy Sunday brunch. Quality of breakfast is good, won't say exceptional. Service is pretty good."}
{"text":"A new find for me, been here twice in a week. The service is great, prices are reasonable, and this place just has such a great vibe.  Also good bottomless coffee! I live for that.  It's always got people inside but never packed. It's super clean and I dig the interior, Not sure how to describe it, except Trendy, comfortable,  and chill.  The only draw back, no wifi, I'd kill for that so I could just set up shop and get some work done too."}
{"text":"I loved the generous portions, and the food tasted great. The service was friendly and fast. The restaurant looks great and is nice and bright.  Really happy to have a place like this around the corner. Must do for Mimico."}
{"text":"OK.  So I was super excited to see a new breakfast place open in my hood.  Went to the Breakfast Room with my partner this past Saturday for the first time.  The place is super cute on the interior...and that is where the good ends.  No one came to seat us at the front, someone just waved from the back kitchen area at the front table.  (They were NOT busy)   The waitress when she finally showed up and acted extremely disinterested, and had to come back to ask about our order again.  Got our beverages.....and then waited approximately 30 minutes to get the food, which would not have been so bad if the food had been cooked properly.  When someone asks for over-easy eggs you expect over-easy, which mine were not.  my partner asked for scrambled soft but instead got eggs that were cooked so long that it just crumbled on his plate.  The homefries were not really grilled, but rather boiled and bland.Got a single cup of coffee and the waitress never came back until the end of our meal to ask if I needed another.  No butter was served with my pancakes....and she never came back for me to ask for it.  So, to sum this up:  Sub-par service,and sub-par food quality equals a no-go for me."}
{"text":"We ate at the Breakfast Room, excited to try a new place we haven't been to before.  However, we were disappointed. It took a long time for the food to come out. We had to chase the waitress to get our drinks refilled. The eggs on the eggs benedict were disappointingly poached firm. All the poached eggs in our group came out with firm yolk - I don't know if this is intentional, but if this is they'd do well to put a note in their menu. The presentation of the homefries scattered across the remainder of the plate left something to be desired. I also beg to differ with the reviewer who said that the portion sizes were good.  My friend enjoyed the salmon na'an, but commented that it fell apart far too easily.  It can be difficult to find a parking spot on the main street in front. On cold winter days, it is incredibly cold for anyone sitting near the door."}
{"text":"Server was really nice, she parked our stroller off by the counter for us & brought us a highchair for our little one. Food was fresh, tasted good & service was quick. I have no complaints, was a wonderful meal, nice little dinner. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place looks non inviting from outside but you step in and you're transformed. It's clean and reminds me of a family diner. A nice place to have brunch on a Sunday. It was not too busy on a Saturday morning. The waitress seated us immediately. The price is good for a classic breakfast. The classic breakfast was exactly what I had. Two well down eggs and toast. The home fries looked inviting but it was not that flavourful or over powering. Service was fast and the waitress kept asking us if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"I went to The Breakfast Room today and found the staff friendly and attentive.  There were about 4-5 tables full and things were served lickety split.  The menu is nothing to write home about - think Golden Griddle or IHOP circa 1990s- but overall they seem to have the basics well covered and the waffle I ordered was perfect and the fruit was great too (the strawberry sauce was great- seemed homemade and not too sweet).  The decor is trendy and I think if they corrected a few spelling errors on their menu and gave it a bit more pizzazz in terms of more contemporary choices I think we would have a neighbourhood winner!  I will definitely back though, for a no-nonsense breakfast!"}
