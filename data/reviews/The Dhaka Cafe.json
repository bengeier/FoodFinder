{"text":"An authentic Bangladeshi restaurant that you are not embarrassed to bring your non-Bangladeshi friends? That's new!   As you walk in, it's clean and bright. We went in around 4 pm for a super late lunch on a Sunday I think, and it was empty. The woman working didn't seem very friendly, and I got a strange vibe. They didn't have any biryani or fuchka at that time, which I thought was pretty strange, since it was a weekend.   The rice and bhorta (mashed stuff basically) is great! You can get a good sense of Bangladeshi cuisine just from this. It also came with daal I think, and we ordered some other items. The Mejban gosh was very good, and I'd order it again. The Galda shrimp was disappointing. It was just one piece, which is pretty small once you extract the meaty parts.   Overall, I want to give this place a 3.75. The food is good, and I am sure I'll be going back, since this is one of the nicest Bangladeshi restaurants around."}
{"text":"A great place for authentic Bangladeshi cuisine.  The quality of food and service are excellent!! Tastefully decorated, clean, nice cozy restaurant. Definitely deserves 5 stars.  We had Mejban Gosh (spicy beef curry cooked to perfection) and Duck curry. Both were perfectly cooked and delicious. Also tried Fuchka, and probably it's one of the best we had in GTA.   I would definitely recommend this place for enjoying Bangladeshi food in a nice cozy environment."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Bangladeshi food.  Great decor as well.  Try the fuchka and fried pomphret fish."}
