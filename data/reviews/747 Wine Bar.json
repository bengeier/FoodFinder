{"text":"I found 747 Wine Bar to be overpriced for what it actually is. Their selection of wine was disappointing and the overall atmosphere seemed a little pretentious. The food portions were the tiniest I've every seen. It leaves much to be desired. I don't think I will be coming back here again. 

All the positive reviews make me think that the owner must have paid someone to write them. If you notice, it seems that most of the positive reviews are written by users with only 1 or 2 reviews."}
{"text":"The place is somewhat pricey and has a boring vibe to it. I have been here a few times and find it lacks atmosphere....maybe it's just me........."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the PicNic Wine Bar... it has great potential, but the service was lacking and the food is incredibly over-priced for what you get. There are many other places in the neighbourhood where you can get better service, better food & a more enjoyable experience for a better price."}
{"text":"Awful place. Used a groupon and they overcharged. Food was oversalted. Waitress just hung out with her friends and didn't serve. Left a crappy tip because of the awful service then got home and realized they overcharged. Called to complain and then got yelled at for leaving a bad tip. Overall not good."}
{"text":"PicNic is one of my fave spots in the city. Amazing charcuterie boards - diners can pick from a huge board of meats, cheese and house-made condiments. The chef will often come out to chat and make pairing recommendations. The service is very friendly and attentive.  Lots of wine to choose from by the glass. I love the atmosphere with lots of wood and a long wooden table down the middle of the room. The bonus is that you can find coupons for PicNic on deal sites to help off-set some of the expense."}
{"text":"My favorite wine bar in Toronto. Great price and great environment. Almost the spot I checked in every weekend. :) Super relax and chill. Lobster spoon and Caribbean chicken is the best on the menu. Plus free parking after 6 pm."}
{"text":"Charcuterie platter is a must try! Got very warm welcome from the hostess. Great food, very reasonable price. Loved the music they play and free parking after 6pm. Definitely will come by again when I'm in the neighbourhood!!"}
{"text":"Small portions, expensive, crackers would be nice instead of just bread.

Ordered a charcuterie platter with meats and cheese also the brie cheese loaf.

The place is similar to Salt in Vancouver.

go here for the wine and cheese experience only."}
{"text":"Great setting and d√©cor...wine selection decent for the price point but it would be nice if they had a few more high end options. Perfect spot for a post dinner drink with a date or nibbling on cheeses and sharing a bottle or two with friends. For anyone who has been to the 'Salt' wine bar in Vancouver, the setting and menu selection is very similar, with cheese and charcuterie choices for snacking.  

I've been there 3-4 times and haven't yet had dinner so I can't really comment on the food, other than the cheeses, which have been tasty."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the warm atmosphere and friendly service.  The wine selection is great and the charcuterie board is a must.  My favourite is the lamb chops or lamb lollipops,  depending on which menu you get."}
{"text":"PicNic (why the silly capitalization, I have no idea) doesn't quite make it to four stars... though with a little more effort from the kitchen, it easily could. 

The good: Great wine selection, all available by the glass. Beautiful interior. Very friendly service. Short, reasonably priced menu.

The so-so: the signature (we're told) charcuterie plate is oh-so-lame. For twenty bucks you get a few slices of two kinds of salami or sausage that the server tells us come from Kensington Market, two pieces of cheese that presumably have the same provenance, and some veggies or fruit. Only the cured salmon and onion jam are made in house. Well, you know what? I can go to European Meats and buy a bunch of sausage myself. When you're located across the street from Ruby Watchco, and in the same city as the Black Hoof and other places that cure their own meats, this just doesn't measure up. 

And the mains? Dijon-flavoured pork stew was nice and hearty.  Salmon was perfectly ok. But they didn't knock our socks off.

This is a great local joint to stop into for a glass of wine or three and a light bite. But I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Great place. Came here on a Saturday night on a date. The service was good (the wait staff were very engaging and fun without being annoying), the beef cheeks were delicious, and the flourless chocolate cake was a perfect end to the night. My only wish is that they would have more wines on the list that aren't so readily available at the LCBO. Overall y was a great experience and I would recommend checking the place out."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places on the East side for drinks and a charcuterie plate.  When they are fully in stock, the selection is pretty great.  3 cheeses, 2 meats and 3 house made pickles for $22.  Portions aren't necessarily generous, but they are delicious.  As well, the servers are gracious and more than willing to help you find the perfect wine pairing - even allowing you to taste a couple before making your final decision.  And Sapporo is one of your favourite beers, then you're in luck as they have it on tap.

Pros: tasty food, great wine, nice atmosphere, a table by the windows lends itself to great people watching, wonderful staff.

Cons: the charcuterie plate is tasty, but not filling."}
{"text":"used to go there when I lived in the neighborhood with my roomie for the charcuterie and wine. 
The charcuterie selection is excellent but not very generous for the premium $ they charge. 
Wine select is fine as well. 
We have almost always just stuck with charcuterie and cheese there and it was always yummy."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in TORONTO!!! I loved everything from the moment we walked in. The bartender was extremely friendly and helpful, the chef was absolutely wonderful...I enjoyed the ambiance and I felt extremely welcomed in this place. They even wrote my name on the advertising board outside for my birthday! I was so surprised! The only regret I have is leaving! I wish we would've stayed later. The drinks were sooooooooooooooooooooooooo good too! 

The next time I\"m in Toronto, that's where I will be!

LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Pic Nic has the opportunity to be a great spot, but they are not delivering on a few fronts. 

Firstly, the decor is awful. It looks as if someone went crazy at IKEA to select the furnishings. Guys - your competition in this neighbourhood is steep, you need to invest in proper furniture and lighting. Give up all the candles, it doesn't work when the chairs are hard as rocks and look bargain basement. Don't pour water using plastic jugs, this isn't lunch hour at the local junior high school.

Secondly, the service needs a shake-up. The gals working that evening sauntered around and acted as if they were doing you a favour to serve you. Save the attitude for when you're out at the bar on your own time, not when I'm paying over $100 to be there. 

Thirdly, the food. Bottom line, don't bother with food because you're clearly phoning it in. Focus your time and attention on good wine (which was decent) and some charcuterie / cheeses. Your menu simply isn't accurate and the quality is awful. Again your competition is blowing you away here.

I like the concept of a wine bar that focuses on good wine, good service and good atmosphere. Integrate your name and brand into those three things and do it well, then I'll return."}
{"text":"A nice affordable wine bar.
This is the type of place I miss from westcoast dining- wine bars.  and picnic simulates that experience really well.

Small place that balances intimate with potential for med-large party events.

Individual couples tables and a large communal table with stools in the middle of the room.

Highlights:
-The charchuterie is an exccellent option for a light dinner and an evening of wine.  The selction is nice and definitely try the JAM with your plates.
-The food menu is a short list of more substantial offerings that all taste amazing.  Filling portions but not overdone- definietly something you could order as a single person or order a few things and share
-Great date place: this place is obviously one of those places where intimacy is created int he dining experiencce, with the small tables, dim lighting, foggy windows and share plates
-Great party place- although it was far from packed, I could imagine this place being a really great venue to host a larger party if you want tot rent a place out for a night.

Low points:
-The serving staff could know a little more about wines, pairings- don't get me wrong- they were gracious and nice, but ME personally, I love when I can tell the staff the flavours I enjoy and have them mix somethingp for me and really impress me in that way (This is the way it is done ina lot of charchuterie and wine bars inthe west coast)
-If you have a large-ish party you will inevitable get seated at the picnic table in the middle which is nice, but it makes it slightly awkward if you're party can't appreciate the long narrow picnic table/stool type seating- and it makes it difficult to talk to anyone beyond your immediate surroundings.

I had an excelent time here and would definitely reccommend it.  My friends, all Torontonians, had never tried this place or this neighbourhood and called it a :\"hidden gem\""}
{"text":"My friend brought me here on a Friday. Food is really good, very reasonable priced. Oysters were on sale on a Friday which is a bit surprising. A lot of good cars parked outside we thought it would be a older crowd but it's packed with young people. We were greeted by the owner, had a really good time at 747 wine bar."}
{"text":"I understand it's difficult to keep your list of charcuterie up to date on your website. So don't list them. List a few that you always have, hint at the rest. 
What's with the popcorn? The beef carpaccio was nice, but truffle infused popcorn? It doesn't matter what you \"infuse\"it with, it's still popcorn. The same goes for the lime and tequila infused popcorn with the shrimp seviche (too much lime and the tomato was a larger dice than the shrimp). Pretentious crap.
As for serving sizes....miniscule. Three small strips of carpaccio with some Arugula? Really? I've had larger servings of better carpaccio in better restaurants for the same price.
Would I go back? No."}
{"text":"Go here for drinks, but not the food. They do have a pretty good wine list however, we had the charcuterie platter which was very disappointing. I almost chipped a tooth on some kind of plastic that was on the prosciutto and two of the cheeses were downright nasty. When I said something about it to the waiter he basically shrugged it off.  

If you want good charcuterie, I recommend Bar Volo on Yonge Street."}
{"text":"PicNic Wine Bar is located in Leslieville and it's exactly what it sounds like - a wine bar with a selection of charcuterie and cheeses and a very small but revamped menu.  Long gone is the duck confit macaroni and cheese (though the miniscule portion sizes remain).  While I loved the flavor of the mac and cheese and my waistline probably thanks them for the portions; the barely there scant shreds of it were forgettable.  But now that they've taken even that flavorful dish off the menu - there isn't much left.

Especially when on a Friday night at 9PM, many of the cheeses/cured meats were crossed off the chalkboard (read, sold out).  Admittedly, I'd probably be infinitely more dissatisfied if I were there for the full pop (our bill came to $90 for 2 x 5oz glasses of red wine, one charcuterie/cheese platter consisting of 2 cheese, 2 meats and 3 accompaniments - of which the grape jelly is a definite winner - that's no surprise seeing as PicNic at Home, their now shuttered off-shoot bakery peddled preserves and jellies as well.  But I digress.  We also ordered 1 main of butternut squash agnolotti and an appetizer of pork belly (since they had, surprise - sold out of the boeuf bourgignon that I had every intention of ordering) and a flourless chocolate cake.  Don't bother asking for a dessert menu - there isn't one.

On a busy Friday night there is 1 server (2 if you count the girl behind the counter mixing drinks who also picks up slack), which is obviously not enough to \"hold down the fort.\"  They are definitely  not attentive as we are left standing at the entrance unattended for several minutes before a body emerges; and the inattentiveness continues into our evening between trying to flag someone down to take our order to having to ask for cutlery to eat our dessert as we weren't too keen with the idea of eating with our fingers like cave women.

I suppose the name PicNic really is apt since you leave feeling like you're ready for a real meal.

Take-home message?  Come (early) to grab a glass of wine and some nibbles, as their cheese/charcuterie platter is actually quite well put together - but then grab dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place was not a full house on a Friday night because the food was great. Service was ace. The scallops were amazing, the warmed goat cheese was amazing as well. I'm local and hit all the restaurants and this place is a pleasant surprise. The sound system and music played is perfect for this venue. I hope they're here to stay."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the neighbourhood and were excited to take a visiting friend out to PicNic Wine Bar since we had been there previously and had a great time. What has happened??? First thing - there was a sign in the window saying \"cash only\" - ugh okay. Not an inexpensive place so we made a special trip to an ATM to take out some cash. Not a big deal but we assumed the meal would be worth the cash run. It wasn't.  When we were seated and reading over the menus, our friend noticed that her menu had a few things scratched out and new descriptions were hand-written on the menu. Odd, we thought, but we asked the server for clarification and he insisted that the original, unaltered menus were correct. See that had been his chance for honesty right there and he blew it. The dish on the menu (I can't recall EXACTLY but I'll try) was something like beef tenderloin with seasonal asparagus and a potato and gruyere gratin - something like that. What had been scratched out was 'asparagus and potato and gruyere gratin' and what had been penciled in was 'roasted potatoes and greens'. So when the server insisted that the original, unaltered menu (asparagus and gratin) was indeed correct, and I then received...wait for it... roasted potatoes and greens, I wasn't very impressed. I mean the potatoes were home fries. Not even good home fries but what you would get at a diner serving all day breakfast. A far cry from gratin. Then, to add insult to injury, my husband who had ordered the pork tenderloin that was supposed to have a side of lentils with bacon or something like that and he got... you guessed it... home fries and greens. We were very very very unimpressed. I don't recall exactly what our friend ordered but I do know it also came with the same sides.  It was a very quiet evening at the restaurant. The place was empty aside from a few other customers. Could the chef seriously only manage the same exact dish with a change of protein? This is a middle- to high-end restaurant not a cafeteria. If you're going to simply slop some greens and home fries on a plate and then add some meat to it rather than give the customer what they ordered, you had better have a good reason. We weren't given one. We were given a free glass of wine I believe. So, as it turns out the person who had altered that menu in pencil had the same experience we did and had valiantly attempted to warn future customers. This is my warning to you: if you have been here in the past and enjoyed it as we had, return with extreme caution. I'm not saying don't go, but be very diligent about getting what you ordered or order the charcuterie and skip the entrees. To me it is unacceptable to put one thing on a menu and serve something else unless you are honest about it up front. If we had been told that the dishes would be altered before we ordered so we could make an informed decision, we wouldn't have been so annoyed. We asked point blank if the dish was going to be as described, and we were told that it would be, so to us this is either poor communication btwn the kitchen and serving staff or just total lack of care. Either way, we will be surprised if PicNic is still in business in a month. I see they have a deal on one of the voucher sites in an attempt to drum up business. That would work if you served good food, but otherwise people will stay away as I will from now on. Oh and by the way, about two months after our visit the 'cash only' sign is still in the window."}
{"text":"A great atmosphere, a great date place for sure and a great place for a solo bar meal and a glass of wine.  

Last night the menu, for me, was spot on.  The menu changes every three months and that, along with friendly staff, music, food and ownership team  keeps me coming back.  Last night would have probably been my 15th visit and only once have I been disappointed and sent back a meal and the re-make was spot on.

Last night was a date night for me and after a couple glasses of consignment Viognier (not available at the LCBO), which was delightful, I moved onto an Aussie Chardonnay to enjoy with our 3 cheese plate. We had a blue, a goat and an aged cheddar and asked for a 4th chunk and opted for Beemster (12 year old gouda) which was excellent.  

For me, I prefer simple fresh bread with my cheese (i read that someone wanted crackers).  I actually like to experience cheese solo on my palate, so I eat it on it's own l and use bread to cleanse my palate in order to enjoy the pairing of each cheese with my wine.  If I am having bread and cheese as a meal (French style) then I'll eat bread with my cheese.

After cheese my date and I shared 4 items from the tasting menu, two salads and two 'ocean' items.  Salad 1 was heirloom tomatoes with basil marinated buffalo Mozzarella with balsamic drizzle and other fresh herbs and light greens, #2 was the california salad, arugula, watermelon, feta and red onion, drizzled w lemon vinaigrette.  From the ocean; Baja Style Mini Crab Cakes accompanied with a caper aioli and Cajun Spiced Panko Prawns served with a lemon aioli.  All items, especially the California salad, were spot on.

Crab cakes were nice and hot, the shrimp well spiced and all presented extremely well.  The aioli with both of these items was to die for - so good.

After dinner we crossed the road and had a drink at AVRO - totally cool spot in Leslieville (which I also recommend).

Overall - excellent and my date loved it"}
{"text":"It's a nice place - we didn't eat - just had a glass of wine and sat at the bar - this is definitely a good place to bring a date - they have a very good wine selection and only one choice of beer. 

It's a little expensive relative to other bars in the area.  

The ambiance is nice and I will probably go back again."}
{"text":"Pic Nic is my neighbourhood go-to spot. 

Although the entrees are good, your best bet are the platters where you choose 2 meats and 2 cheeses and 3 garnishes for $20. The cheese is especially good, with an ever changing selection.

The martinis aren't great, but it's a wine bar, so that's fine."}
{"text":"While my Yelp kin were busy stuffing their maws on the breast of Motha India at a UYE, I was on the other end of Queen Street taking flight, wine flights that is at the PicNic Wine Bar.  I was meeting up with a past employee who I was trying to lure back to my agency and when I asked her where she'd like to meet up she suggested PicNic since it is her her hood.  Immediately I routed the Yelp reviews and noted that all of them were four stars so this was a good sign.  

It was a great evening.  We just kicked back and took in the atmosphere.  I love the vibe in this room and considering that we were sitting next to the front door that is really giving a big thumbs up to this spot.  Usually sitting next to the front door on a frosty winter's night is a chilling experience but for whatever reason the glass across the front of this bar is air tight and not even remotely draughty.  If you do get a chill there is a basket of rolled up pashmina's/wraps sitting by the front door.  Such thoughtfulness on the part of this establishment.

There is a good selection of wines by the ounce (3 or 6), half bottles & full bottles.  Or you can go with a wine flight and get 3 glasses of wine with 2 ounces each in them.  So we started with a Chardonnay flight and I must say the sommelier, Matt, is a great guy.  He puts the glasses down on the table, pours right at the table and tells you what each wine is.  No way were these a two ounce pour, easily a generous 3 ouncer.   Tasting wine in this manner is a great way to learn about how different chardonnays from Chile, California, Canada and Australia can be.  The legs, the nose, the body....no this is not me describing another Dexter episode.  

We ordered a cheese/meat/condiment plate to start.  There is a blackboard on the backwall giving you the choices so you build your own charcuterie plate.  Our only requests were that one cheese be creamy and rich and the other be stinky.  The plate came with a heaping basket of very fresh, crispy baguette.  Along side we had a fruit condiment, spicy olives and some slatherings of olive oil on the plate.  As far as charcuterie boards I've had way better and this was the only reason I yanked a star off this rating.  Still though, it was good but when you've had great (Black Hoof/Splendido/Local) it's a tough act to follow.  

We ordered the Tuna Tartare which was sooooo delicious with black sesame seeds in it.  It was sided with these really cool lotus chips and wakame salad.  We also ordered the chicken satays that showed up sitting atop a bed of couscous with lentils and bulgur.  It was delicious and had a real madras of flavours.  Both plates were beautifully splayed with their food and garnishes.  

Our second flight was with reds and we tried a great Ripasso from Italy (our fave), a Carmeniere from Chile and a Cab Sav from the Cali coast.  In both tastings we found one wine we liked more than the other and opted to have a second tasting.  It was a booze' em up night in Riverdale and we loved every minute of it.  

Downside to PicNic, no desserts.  (insert pout here)  I'm going to have to work on them!  It would have been nice to finish off with something chocolatey and rich.  Alas, it was not to be.  The other comment I have to make about PicNic is that the room is fairly consumed by a large communal table, which is ok but I don't care for backless chairs.  If you are going to sit for a while slurping up the grape I like to have a chair I can lean back against.  

In total there were 16 small pours with all the food and the bill came to $120 which I felt was very fair.  It was a great evening, music was fab, service was attentive and respectful and the room is super comfy for wine libations.  Oh by the way, my ploy worked.  My former staff is coming on back!  Thank you PicNic for helping me seal the deal!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with 2 of girlfriends - it was a pretty nice experience.  I called in advance to see if reservations were needed (on a weekend, I would definitely recommend).  It's a small, intimate venue.  There were 2 larger parties there, when we arrived, and a smaller party of 4 (and those 3 parties, took up most of the available seating).  Lucky I called in advance to reserve the high tops by the window!  The bar area was pretty full with other patrons.

We ordered the PicNic Plate - with some yummy pate, and the cheese plate (which had blue cheese, a goat gouda (yum) and something else soft-ish and delicious - but the name escapes me).

They had  a nice wine list (as one would expect for a wine bar).  I was pretty happy with our experience.  It's a nice lounge place, with a decent food menu.  It totally fit the bill, I was looking for a place with reasonable eats, a variety of drinks (alcoholic and non), with out a super bar-like vibe, and this was it!"}
{"text":"Soooooooooooo nice.

It looked like a really cozy place to chill, and since I had a voucher from one of those discount sites, why not?

The ambience and decor is too cute with it`s wooden benches and candlelit tables. 

I'm not a total fan of wine, so the wine list was no concern of mine. The charcuterie board was my favourite! I'm not too familiar with the preserved meats and cheeses of this world, but in my eyes it was fantastic. 

We had gotten the P.E.I Mussels ($10) and the Salmon Sashimi ($12) as well. 
The only downside which makes this place a 4 star rather than a 5 star review was that the portion sizes were a wee bit too small, especially for the price. 

I would definitely come here again with a voucher, but on a normal day, probably not. It's a bit too pricey, and personally I`m not too much of a wine person."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I really wanted to enjoy Pic Nic, but they just didn't do us right the last time we visited.

I will provide the caveat that we were the last ones in the place, very close to closing time. I understand that some problems arise with customers like us. However, it should be the goal of any good restaurant to provide for every single customer. 

We ordered a cheese plate, wine, and two main dishes.

The cheese was pretty mediocre, and the wine even more so. Back in the states, we can buy this wine by the case at any grocery store, very cheaply. I didn't realize this until later in the evening when I asked what our (recommended) wine actually was. Shame on me, or shame on them? Not sure.

The main dish was a very gamey lamb dish with too much spice on it, I couldn't finish it very well. My fiancee didn't enjoy her dish either. 

The service was pleasant enough, I suppose. But for the price I've definitely had much better. 

I hope PicNic is better for other folks, they have a really cute setup. Very romantic. But food takes precedence for me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for dating.  Reminds me of NYC wine bar & serve decent food. Will try the $22 platter next time as my mom is not too much into cheese.  Over 30 wines to choose from if you want a glass to sip on.  Free street parking after 6pm!"}
{"text":"Ordering a flight was a chore, as a fellow bartendet i wad more knowledgeable about the wine then the own bartender. Took 15minutes for the drinks to arrive while we watched him chat with a friend at the bar. We asked for the bill as the wine arrived and then had to re ask after sitting there with empty glasses waiting. The wine was okay same with decor. Service was terrible and disappointing"}
{"text":"If this place was located at king and Portland, it might have a fighting chance, but the east end demands better quality. The food is ok, but lacks originality. The wine list is a veritable who's who from the vintages section at the LCBO that feels as though it was hand selected by a university student who was trying to impress his girlfriend. The \"by the glass\" business model doesn't allow for the type of quality I would expect from a wine bar. I believe that this place has a ton of potential as the service is good and the interior decor is contemporary and pleasant. I fully believe that with a little time, this place will be all that I hoped it would."}
{"text":"Ugg, I hate giving this only a 3 because it was really good - nice charcuterie plates and good wine, but it's overpriced and I hate that because it makes me not want to go back. The wine is good but the markup is too much. The tapas style sharing plates are nice as well, so if you can get over the lack of bang for the buck I suggest trying it!"}
{"text":"Great new times coming!

Between Ian getting the front of the house organized with Emma and Michlle, the cocktails rock and are truly different every week.
The back of house was strained, but 2014 adds iron chef consulting chef Greg Argent with his executive chef Rebecca lDeWildte , the regulars are so excited about the new dishes and the absolute creativity that is now being applied to the main dishes.
Our gang eats here every Tuesday And now we have something to look forward to : experimental Tuesdays !
Nice to have Pic Nic in their 6th year, spending the effort to keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and we were greeted the second when we walked in. It was a Friday we had to wait for our seat at the bar, bartender was very kind and gave us free alcohol while we were waiting. Highly recommend this spot!!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the stellar staff.
But I don't pay dollah bills for the peeps. 
That would be like prostitution. 

The food itself itself fell a little flat for me. I like the idea of building your own charcuterie board, but good meals aren't built on ideas alone. I need the flavor. And these guys just didn't measure up. 

Decent wine list though."}
{"text":"Actual rating is 3.5.

Pic Nic is cute.  When I first got there, the music selection was a little dicey.  The place itself looks chill and the clubby music didn't go with the vibe, but they mixed it up and put on stuff a little more down tempo.

The wine prices are a bit steep.  I had the Chianti and it was decent, but at $12 a glass, it was getting up there.

I ordered the panko truffle mac and cheese for dinner and while it was okay, it didn't rock my world.  I am sorry I didn't order something from the back wall because I saw one of the wood boards full of goodies pass my table and it looked very tempting.

The server was friendly and efficient.

I would go back, but I'd try other places first."}
{"text":"Not bad but Not great.
Had a lovely Tempranillo red wine first time there. Loved it but the next time i went they were out of the good one. they often run out of things.
the charcuterie was OK but i make those at home, so it was nothing better than what you can do yourself. and not very filling for the price. though i have to say myself and my 3 friends Love the Spicy pickles! To the point where my buddy asked to buy a jar of them!
i tried some of my friends orders once and i remember i didn't like the Arancini i think its called. the italian rice ball. thats the second time I've seen people order it thinking its going to be a pasta or something. An odd dish. 
On another occasion a relative said the pate was like poo. yikes. 
my friends Love this place, they swear by it, they love the owner etc. But personally I don't think its a food place. Way more of a place to pop in for wine.
i like that they offer 3 oz glasses though they are expensive."}
{"text":"I don't push around a stroller pricier than your car, nor do I have a Canada Goose coat keeping me warm atop my pricy yoga wear. Basically, I don't fit in in Leslieville. This isn't a knock to the wealthy-new-mommy culture happening here. I'm actually pretty jealous of their lifestyle, it just isn't me. Yet.*

I popped in here with a pal trying to avoid St. Patrick's Day shenanigans, because nothing says Not St. Paddy like a wine bar with charcuterie specials. The staff was unbelievably friendly, but their cocktails fell flat. The charcuterie mix and match is really cute, but it just isn't the best I've had. This being said, I still had a lovely time with my pal, and if someone asked me to meet them here for wine and cheese, I certainly wouldn't object. 

*The yoga pants will never be me, though. Let's be serious."}
