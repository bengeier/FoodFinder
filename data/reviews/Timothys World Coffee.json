{"text":"I come this place 2-3 times a week.  BREAKFAST SPECIAL $1.99 (Coffee and Bagel) is best value in GTA.---I think! And also I can shop whatever I needed for the day. This place has Rabba and flower shop too. I enjoy variety of coffee and tossted bagel."}
{"text":"We stopped in here while wandering down Bloor, needing something to keep us awake. This did not disappoint. It's clean, well lit, with pretty much all the accoutrements one needs from an upscale coffee chain. It's pretty much like a Starbuck's or a Peet's to my American sensibilities, but with its own Canadian flavor."}
{"text":"A one stop shop for all your shopping needs with super convenient hours and a GREAT, hard working owner. You can find everything from a great cup of coffee, some fresh produce, flowers to some jewlery, nick nacks or even some cool gifts here! I can't tell you how many necklaces, ear rings.. scarves and little nick nacks I have picked up at this place. Very affordable and so adorable!  During the day they have an excllent small deli menu with all kinds of different specials and meals. One of my FAVs here is the Rhuben sandwich made to order.... OH MY, amazing!! They have some really good premade sandwiches, wraps and salads as well.   Open 24 hrs with excellent service no matter what time of day but the night shift guy is a familiar and kind face always working hard with a friendly demeanor. A little pricier then your average convenience store but its 24 hrs and offers such a great variety that I don't mind one bit!"}
