{"text":"Chef' s omelette on the pan is phenominal !!! My favourite brunch place, it's two steps away from marche Atwater . I recommend this place !"}
{"text":"I dig it here.  It's made my brunchtastic list due to a combination of location, food, prices and the feel of the place.  All three times I've been were at busy weekend brunch times but I've never waited long for a table. I just would pop in, tell the \"host\" how many were in my party/give my name, waited in the front foyer and then usually was seated in 5-10 mins. It's street parking but you can also use the shopping lot across the street.  It's always busy, humming with conversations and seating is cozy with neighbouring tables. It has a neat little interior decor with a side of rustic exposed painted brick and the art of some local artist hanging on the walls. The waiters have always been super friendly as well as attentive whenever I've gone... the only delay was while waiting to pay but I was quite content to sit there and let my belly digest my brunch for a while anyway.  The crepes, eggs benny and signature skillets are delicious. I had the vegetarian and cheese omelette once and it was alright but needed a bit of a flavour punch to be better. My friends went apeshizzle over the cretons so I guess it was good too, if that's your thing. Next up I'm trying their waffles and a croissant sandwich.  Also, mimosas. When in doubt always have a mimosa.  I will definitely become a regular here, especially with out of town friends.  It was salivating... and not just because of the food. The waiters wear suspenders. I approve."}
{"text":"Awsome service! Wait staff was very friendly! And we were a groupe and it went fairly quickly! Food was fresh and good! portions were just right and the prices were reasonable as well. The ambiance is good, the music was a bit loud, dont think i would go with my parents since they wouldnt be able to hear me, but for me it was fine. Keeping it bookmarked!"}
{"text":"J'adore y aller le matin pour le menu lève-tôt.  La principale raison, le rapport qualité prix. Enfin possible de fuir les chaînes de restaurants à déjeuner qui coûte la peau des fesses et qui offre des portions de crêpes trop grosse pour rien. Un super endroit."}
{"text":"I love this place.  You can pick holes in some of their menu items. However it is the combination of good home cooked food, ambience, friendly service and value for money that make this restaurant my regular place for breakfast ,lunch/ brunch. They are no longer open for dinner. I am  sorry to not have supported them more when they were."}
{"text":"*** 2.5 stars ***  I came across Resto Quoi De N'oeuf on my most recent trip to Montreal; my SO and I walked in to this little brunch spot.  The line up process was a bit confusing, we stood inside for about 5 minutes before told that we need to wait inside the vestibule where they had a sign (tout en francais) stating to wait in the vestibule.  After they realized we were waiting for a table in the vestibule, we were seated about 5 minutes later.  Mid-day Sunday, this place was happening.  The item to get is their skillet omeletes.  I ordered the Queen while my SO ordered the standard eggs and toast breakfast.  Overall, the food was average.  The service was meh as we placed our order 10 minutes after we were seated.  For a place that needs to turns tables quickly, the service did not match.  We had attitude as well from the servers.  The skillets are unique but I would try elsewhere before come back for a return visit."}
{"text":"So, this thing is right around my house and I had no idea. Amazing breakfast, probably the best eggs benedict I've had in a while and the rest of the food that was prancing around in other peoples tables looked delicious. Definitely going back there for more. Try it but remember: Go early 'cause around 11pm on weekends this place is packed."}
{"text":"I've had better breakfasts in the U.S. in the middle of nowhere than at this place.  All the other 4 and 5 star reviews must be from friends or family members because there is no way this place ranks as a 4 or 5... that, or my standards for a basic breakfast are too high.  SERVICE  Crap. Obviously.   Condescending, rude, they ignored me the entire time I was there and was not interested in serving me.   FOOD  Subpar. The only thing worth eating on the plate were the fried potatoes but that's because they crisped them well and put seasoning salt all over them.  The rest of the meal was crap. I had the omelette (does it matter which kind? it won't matter because they will more than likely all suck). Underseasoned, watery... need I go on?  OTHER ANNOYING THINGS  Maple syrup is $2.83 extra. WTF? Why don't you just give free Aunt Jemima's maple syrup and if people want \"real\" maple syrup, then charge them $0.50 extra? How much goddamn syrup do you think people are eating to charge them $2.83 extra?  The menu is all over the place and confusing with its placement of wording and boxes. Get it together, it's all a mashed French / English and in some areas, confusing to know what tehy are referring to.  Nope. Not coming back.  Should have trusted my instincts and gone to the Mamie Clafoutis down the road. At least I would have been satisfied with a real croissant and pain au chocolat.  Gah. What a waste of money. I'm kind of annoyed right now.  Freakin' lying yelpers."}
{"text":"De bon matin, nous prenons le métro avec une amie pour nous rendre de l'autre côté du Mont-Royal afin d'aller dénicher une nouvelle place de brunch. Ce fut une belle découverte! La déco n'est pas éblouissante, les plats pas transcendants, mais le juste milieu de tout cela nous a fait passer une belle matinée. De plus, le service fait partie de mes très bons souvenirs.  Je ne retournerais pas faire tout ce trajet (car ce n'est pas mon quartier de résidence) uniquement pour cette place, comme on a pu le faire cette fois-ci. Mais elle mérite tout de même d'être testée! Bon appétit! :)"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices with reasonable service. Nice little place with a mediocre view on the street. The whole menu seemed to resolve around very mainstream ideals of what a breakfast should be: sausages, bacon, egg, French toast and crepes formed 90% of the 8 page menu. Many of the items on the list resemble each other which makes most choices somewhat redundant and a tad confusing.  The menu could have easily been 1 page, they just spread it out with cheap graphic design and repetitive categories.  The food was pretty tasty and served promptly. The establishment is very clean and the staff members were quite friendly and responsive.  Be aware, the maple syrup they serve isn't real maple syrup. (pretty disappointing) Also the jam packages were the cheap Kraft hospital food kind.  They really nailed the French toast and the bacon though."}
{"text":"I can understand some of the poor reviews with regards to service. Our coffee did not come before proactively intercepting a bus boy with coffee and our breakfast did take longer than normal to arrive. When it did arrive the waitress had to go back to the kitchen twice to remedy mistakes in the order (first for cheese and second for the proper bread).  Those service issues aside, the food we ate was delicious. We both went for skillets which seems to be the signature breakfast here and definitely recommended. Our waitress was very nice just not the most efficient service.  Pros: Delicious skillets Cons: Slow service"}
{"text":"A much better than average breakfast, in a city that knows good brunches.  Tasty cretons on toasted baguette, beans, eggs... I'll be back to try their specialties. Disappointed in the OJ though.  And coffee was merely competent.  But come early, come often, I know I'll be there, it's a friendly, noisy community gathering spot with delicious food.  Kudos."}
{"text":"Good value overall, but your choice of brunch place will depend on what you're looking for...  Quoi De Neuf has a great variety of breakfast options, fresh juices and at least one smoothie. Their potatoes are nice and crispy, the food is generally good. Although beware : you'll have to pay if you want real maple syrup (3$ for a 1oz bottle). However their café au lait is mediocre at best.  Toi, Moi et Café nearby had much less choice in terms of food and fresh juices, and the style is slightly different (eg. Soft breakfast potatoes), but their coffee is MILES ahead, a real treat!!  Take your pick"}
{"text":"Walked in Saturday around noon and the place was full! Luckily there was a two-seat table available for me. For most, the wait was about 15min. The diner-style breakfast and lunch location had a relatively younger crowd of patrons. Seating is casual and seats may feel a bit cramped for those used to diners with booths.   The menu has a large variety of breakfast foods, from the basic sausage and eggs to skillets with a variety of ingredients. Coffee is offered shortly after you're seated, and menus are bilingual. I ordered the Reine (Queen) skillet which had home fries, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, and shallots, topped with scrambled egg and a choice of hollandaise sauce or Swiss cheese (or both!). A side of bread was also available-and I chose the baguette. The skillet came piping hot and lived up to expectations, and the baguette was soft and already buttered. Don't be tricked by the size of the skillet-it's a filling meal!  The price per person came out to about $15 tax included, which I felt was good qualité/prix. Would definitely recommend for a small group of friends looking for brunch, be sure to come early as they close at 2:30pm every day!  My second visit I ordered the Two of Spades skillet - salmon, mushrooms, spinach, onions, capers, egg whites, feta. There's no bed of home fries so it is a smaller skillet overall, and the flavours are different from say a traditional \"breakfast food\" taste. The salmon and veggies were well seasoned (on the salty side) and tasty all on their own - something I would've had with a side of rice. The egg white and feta didn't really glue with the salmon and veggies, and the capers rolled around separately. It was an interesting take on skillets, but for the price and volume of food I won't be ordering this one again."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast here after a lovely morning at Atwater market. My friend had an amazing omelet which she said was one of the best she had the whole trip. I had a a amazing skillet that was huge and delicious."}
{"text":"What a treat this place was! My husband and I were looking for some delicious breakfast on a Monday afternoon and this place hit the spot!  The portions were more than generous; I had a Swiss cheese, bacon and spinach omelet served with breakfast potatoes and some fruits and my husband opted for the extra traditional breakfast: baked beans, cretons, pancake.. the works!  The food was excellently seasoned, the choice of bread was fantastic (white, brown, baguette) and for myself I opted for the gluten free muffin seeing as I have celiacs disease (could of had gluten free bread but a muffing sounded way better!) and contrary to most gluten free items- the muffin was moist and succulent and not crumbly and dry! I would definitely order it again!  Our service was fantastic! As the only waiter in the place at 1pm, he was very attentive, polite and helpful.  I definitely recommend this place and will absolutely be returning!"}
{"text":"Really nice place for breakfast - especially during the week when you don't have to compete with the weekend brunch-and-crying-kid crowds. If you go on the weekends, I strongly suggest getting there before 10AM for a table or else the line can be really long and you'll have to wait (hence the crying kids!)  Good coffee and eggs, and terrific service. Love the wait staff there."}
{"text":"Great quality for great value.  This is one of my favourite brunch places, it's super cute and is steps away from the Atwater Market and Lachine Canal. It's ideal for those summer days when you'd like to take a little stroll or bike ride after. It's usually busy and tends to have a line up during typical brunch hours, so the earlier (or later) you get in.. the better!   I'm a big fan of their omelettes (the one's served in the cast iron skillet, too) and their benedicts! Their menu offers up so many varieties, all of which are delicious! Their potatoes are made to perfection... perfectly spiced, perfectly crispy on the outside, and perfectly soft on the inside!   Whether you like it salty or sweet... you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming. Both my husband and myself ordered breakfasts which included poached eggs, and they were totally overcooked. Is there anything more disappointing than a Benedict with a hard boiled egg on top?! Then we ordered caesars which were 3/4 ice... bland with a piece of cold bacon for garnish. no spicy bean? No pickle? No other garnish? Watery and wildly overpriced at close to $10 each. Very disappointing. Our two plates and two drinks came to $65 after tax... just crazy!! I will not return.    Oh and also mildly annoying is the fact that they only have ketchup in packets... Environmentally unfriendly and just a pain."}
{"text":"Their menu says \"Menu santé, sans gluten et végétarien sont disponible\" yet when I got there, the waiter told me the only gluten-free food they had was a muffin (other than their egg-based dishes).  The food was very mediocre.  Also there's NO AIR CONDITIONING and the tables are all uncomfortably close to each other. I'm never coming back to this dump."}
{"text":"Another Yelp find while in Montreal for Osheaga. This place was close to where we stayed, and we were lucky to get a table without waiting - the line outside definitely grew longer shortly after we arrived! A busy place is generally a sign of good food, too.   I had the main breakfast special with two meats and my bf had the waffle. Wow - portions are excellent. Service is good, and the range of options is pretty impressive. I saw a skillet pass by and I had order envy for sure.   Will defintely come back next time we are visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"A friend took me out for brunch here to celebrate my birthday, so I really shouldn't complain... there is really nothing wrong with this place, but nothing impressed me either.  It's a popular spot on the weekends, there was a lineup when we arrived on a Saturday around noon, but the service is efficient and we got a table within 15 minutes.  Menu is quite extensive, with the usual brunch suspects.  I had a veggie omelette which was ok but unremarkable.  Prices are reasonable and service is quick and friendly.  I can see why other people like this place, it's easy and reliable.  If you want a more adventurous brunch outing, best to try elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had breakfast with friends and enjoyed food, service & venue. One downside is the nigh level of noise from the small area.   I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"good price good taste good portion.  The service was great as well, I will totally recommend"}
{"text":"I could see why some people would say why this brunch place is nothing special and very ordinary. It really depends on the dish you get. But I really don't mind an ordinary breakfast that's simple. That's just me.   Yesterday was my third time at Quoi de Neuf and I ordered something out of my comfort breakfast zone: NOT a benedict but an special omelet. I ordered the Queen, and yes it is amazing. It was served in an iron cast pan, sizzling hot, and full of great flavors. It was all omelet on top and lo and behold underneath was where all the magic was for me. Perhaps I am hyping it up, but man that omelet was served in such a unique way. Never have eaten omelets like that. It was basically a thin omelet with all the filling (mushrooms/red peppers etc) underneath the thin layer.   Delicious! I scraped up every piece. Service has always been very fair here , every time I go. Always attentive with the refill of coffee, and they are in good spirits. Not bad for brunch. I find some brunch/breakfast joints the waiters show their stress.   Anyways, if you're near Atwater market, or Lionel Groulx, stop by for breakfast then do your groceries! Although Saturdays get really busy, not friendly for groups because you have to wait usually."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, good hearty breakfast and very friendly staff. I always get one of the skillets, last time I had the steak one, would not recommend that you get this one it was like boiled chewy meat... yeah.... Other than that great place definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Small popular brunch spot but well worth the wait in line! Variety, quality, value. Try the creton."}
{"text":"I am an avid breakfast eater, I've been to my fair share of these types of restaurants and let me just say, this is probably the best breakfast place in the city. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the consistency of the yolk was right on point and the coffee was great. For the first time in my life have I had bacon at a restaurant that was neither too soggy nor greasy but just crispy and perfect. I would come here both for the food and the charming neighborhood. Eat brunch then walk down to the Atwater market for a taste of Montreal. Definitely go here if you like breakfast food and good service in a quaint and cute café setting."}
{"text":"Great brunch in a great place. We'll be definetely coming back!"}
{"text":"Le personnel est très accueillant, les petits déjeuners sont toujours excellents, leur crème hollandaise est à tomber. Très bonne adresse pour bruncher !"}
{"text":"I guess this is really not my kind of place. Overall this resto-café had an artsy pretentious feel that I did not care for at all. Service was average, as was the food.  I ordered an egg, ham & gruyere cheese breakfast sandwich which consisted of an overcooked hard boiled egg (the yolk had started turning gray), sliced deli ham and cheap tasting cheese. I was really not impressed. Coffee was included with the breakfast sandwich but they wouldn't substitute it for hot chocolate which was a little disappointing since a lot of places do. Compared to other restaurants their servings are also a lot smaller. Based on my experience I definitely won't be back since there are so many better options for brunch."}
{"text":"Lovely little breakfast spot. Coffee is mediocre, but the prices are amazing. Two people for $18, including tax and tips."}
{"text":"Premier et dernier passage chez eux ....  Nous sommes rentrés sans trop d'attente dans ce commerce et nous sommes ressortis encore moins enthousiasmés ....  Au niveau de la carte elle est très classique pour les brunch. Vraiment rien qui sort de l'ordinaire.  Nous avons pris : - uf bénédictine jambon, champignon et brie : la portion de patate est juste minuscule et on retrouve à peine un petit morceau de melon et d'orange. Histoire de dire qu'il y a un minimum de fruits ... On me sert le plat au début sans jambon. Après m'en etre rndu compte j'appelle le serveur et lui demande si c'est normal que je n'ai pas de jambon dedans. Il ne demande le plu simplement du monde \"si j'en veux ?\". En même temps il s'agit d'un ingrédient du plat donc oui que j'en veux ... Pas d'excuse, rien du tout et on évoque comme d'hab le \"nouveau en cuisine\" qui a du se tromper. Ok pour l'erreur mais pas que le serveur prenne un air condescendant derrière et me sorte ca. Je m'en fout qu'il ait 1J ou 10 ans de service ... Le plat en lui même n'a rien de particulier et je ne sens pas vraiment le gout du brie ce qui est bien dommage ... - déjeuné traditionnel : les saucisses ne sont vraiment pas bonne. On retrouve des saucisses purement industriel où on a l'impression que c'est un conglomérat de viande réunis. Quand on voit arrivé la saucisse on se demande si c'est même bien une saucisse. Le gout n'en parlons pas ... Le reste de l'assiette vraiment basique niveau qualité ...   Très déçu donc des plats et du service ... Nous ne vous le conseillons pas du tout !"}
{"text":"Second time eating here on the same visit to Montreal. The food is delicious and the service is fast. A nice lovely place with such fast service that there isn't usually a wait on the weekends they say. The home fries are a definite must try as my whole family devoured them. It's also close enough so that you can pop over to Atwater Market right after breakfast and walk off the carbs from the four slices of baguette that you might have eaten. Lol."}
{"text":"Cute place, nice location, yummy food.  What else do I need to say? My omelet was perfectly cooked and the potatoes passed the test!   Prices were pretty decent too woot woot!"}
{"text":"I was Joe S.'s date...but anyway! Great spot. Perfect eggs over easy and the best toast everrrrrr served with an eggs breakfast. No stars off for it, but it quickly became what felt like 100 degrees inside during our meal. Coffee was average, but everything else, (including service) was above. Something fun was that they also have a variety of jellies AND peanut butter at each table. Bonus points in my book."}
{"text":"Was rather disappointed with this place. Very average. Much rather breakfast here http://www.restomontreal.ca/en/36/Aux-Derniers-Humains ."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite place to brunch on the entire island.   Everything about Quoi de n'Oeuf is perfect!  The staff is adorable, everyone is friendly and helpful without being overbearing. The split second you sit down; you're offered a cup of coffee on top of that you never have to ask for more since the waiters have some sort of spidey sense and are always offering more when your start running low.   The second most important part of a brunch after coffee is food. You won't be disappointed here! The food is fresh and not too greasy compared to other spots. I love the portions size, big enough to brunch but not too much that you can't barely get up your chair. Like I mentioned in the top section, the fruits are always fresh and ripe so it's worth forking the price to get an extra sides of them. I like how they go the extra mile to offer you a nice variety to change it up a bit from the usual. For example, try the baguette instead of plain toasts. While you're at it get the cretons as part of your meat choice. It's delicious on said baguette!  The house specialty is fried eggs in a skillet with choices of vegetables and meats. It's very popular with the patrons and as delicious. It's also bigger and richer than their other plates. The only negative I can see with the food is that for bigger appetites, the plates are either small or they don't serve enough potatoes. Not a problem for me since I can barely finish my plate as it is but the boyfriend expects me to finish my plate so he can fulfill his appetite fully if you see what I mean.   Price wise, it's cheap to moderate.  The skillets and crepes are a bit more expensive but a full breakfast will cost you around $10 tax in. The place is not very big but you can easily skip the line if you get there prior to 10 a.m.  If you do have to wait in line, it usually goes by pretty fast. It does get more busy when it's sunny outside.   While some people may argue that they're not the most creative, and they're not completely false, Quoi de N'oeuf remains at the top of my list because they do a classic breakfast well. I love venturing out to try something new but sometimes you just can't beat a classic!  P.S. For the coeliac people out there, they offer a gluten-free muffin (individually wrapped) with yogurt and fruits. My coeliac mom tried it and wasn't contaminated! That's bonus points for me!!! :)"}
{"text":"It's your average breakfast jump. They offer nothing special which is it's downfall. They could have homemade beans but they don't. The bacon tasted like pre-cooked maple-leaf bacon. If you have Home Fries on your menu, don't serve me deep-fried potato chunks, it's annoying and cut-cornerish and ya know a few herbs won't hurt either.  But for standard breakfast fare, it works"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place for a reasonable price and wait. Find the place thanks to friends. The wait wasn't too bad for peak times and the staff was super friendly about it. I had the house special skilett without the sauce and I enjoyed it very much. I like the uniqueness of the dish for breakfast and it was good. I would go bad - but nothing mind breaking for breakfast. Just good option. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's an OK breakfast place, the food isn't anything special, the last time I went the service was horrible. I got there early enough that I didn't have to stand in line and there were plenty of open tables. When my waiter finally brought my food it was cold and greasy, not to mention he never came back to ask if I needed anything else. If you're looking for a breakfast place there are far better places in the neighbourhood, and if you see a lineup don't bother waiting."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, food is good but the service is ALWAYS horrible. We called and checked what time they close at, after showing up with enough time to eat the busboy or waiter who answered us at the door made us feel so uncomfortable about staying and continuously reminded us of our time frame, even after I called and got confirmation that when we showed up in the next ten minutes we'd have enough time and wouldn't be inconveniencing anyone. Long story short we didn't stay and I definitely won't be going back or suggesting this place to anyone. The only reason it give it two stars is they sadly do have good food."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on a weekend, even though the service is a little slow (it was very crowded), the food was excellent. I will definitely go again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Superbe endroit de déjeuner pas trop cher. Le service n'est pas le meilleur mais n'est pas le plus pire non plus. Je vais manger à ce restaurant environ 1 fois par mois et je suis toujours très satisfaite coter papilles gustatives. Les saucisses sont un must, il faut en avoir mangé pour le savoir!"}
{"text":"The Atwater market area has many great breakfast places and this restaurant is one of them. The wait to get a table wasn't bad considering it was a Saturday morning.  We were seated in about 10-15 minutes.   I ordered the eggs which came with a choice of meat (sausage in my case), feves aux lards, potatoes and toast.  I really liked how they do their potatoes and the sausage was also really good.  I wasn't too crazy about the feves aux lards but I've never been a fan of them to begin with.   The prices are very reasonable here.  Filtered coffee is included with your meal.  The total bill was $14 after tip.  Service is also pretty good.  Overall I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service. Highly recommended :)  Très bonne nourriture, très bon service. Je le recommande vivement."}
{"text":"Très bonne localisation, non loin du marché Atwater et du canal de Lachine. Placement et service très rapide. Petit bémol dans les assiettes avec des légumes au gout de poêlé congelé. Les crêpes étaient bonnes et le prix était raisonnable."}
{"text":"I used to live in a neighborhood a couple years ago, and Quoi de n'oeuf was my favorite breakfast restaurant.  I went back recently, and I was disappointed. I took a classic eggs benedict. The eggs were good, well cooked, the sauce was nice, the potatoes were tasty.  So why the 3 stars, A-OK note? Because of the size of the plate. For this price (almost $20 with tip, for one person), it was quite small. Not a whole lot of potatoes, and the only fruits you get is a a half-slice of orange and a small piece of melon. For the same price, other restaurants will have much bigger plates with more fruits.  The included filter coffee was fine but I would have liked if they let the milk basket on the table. I don't want to ask for extra milkettes whenever they re-heat my cup.  Service was ok. Maybe it was not a good day for the waiter, but it was not particularly friendly.  So its not that the food is not good, it is, but the value isn't there. Which is a shame, because I used to love this place."}
{"text":"A very cute breakfast  spot that has something for everyone. You may have to wait a little to get seated but it's worth it. I've had their regular 2 eggs and meat breakfast  which comes with yummy fresh baguette bread if you want. This morning I chose the choco-banana crepes where simply delicious and are available in half portions for those who have smaller appetites. All the servers are nice but it took a long time to get our bill, although we didn't mind having some extra time to chat."}
{"text":"I went to Resto-Café Quoi de N'uf with 9 of my buddies for my bachelor party in Montreal.  We were browsing around for a place to eat and walked in, doubtful we were going to get seated due to the large size of our party.  The owner greeted us kindly and quickly got to moving about tables to get us situated.  Drinks came quickly and they were great.  We practically ordered the whole menu and were passing them around so we could try everything.  We did the same with our entrees and it was unanimous that the food was great.  We didn't have dinner plans for the night so we asked the owner if he had any recommendations.  Coming from NYC, we have a great deal of variety and wanted an authentic Montreal dinner.  He jumped on the phone promptly and made reservations for us; such a nice thing to do and dinner was awesome as well. We went back for breakfast the next morning and this will be my go-to spot when back in town. LOVE THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Favourite breakfast spot, nice atmosphere and good food. Not pricey either."}
{"text":"This place was OK. My plate wasnt that delicious, and also it was bit too salty. The price was rather expensive compared to the level of food they made."}
