{"text":"Poor service, and seems like they don't care about quality of food. So, funny thing is we were on our way to Texas Road house, which is right next door, we turned in the wrong parking lot and decided to give it a try cause we had never been to a Lone Star Steakhouse before, but frequented the Road house back in the Midwest.It seemed their prices were a bit higher, but for a good steak well worth it . I ordered a 8oz sirloin with a baked potato and salad, around $14. I also got a margarita. The waitress was prompt, but seemed maybe fairly new cause she didn't know much about the menu. She forgot our waters and came back with half a loaf of bread and forgot again. The bread was not very good and butter was unspreadable. The bread was cold so it just kind of tore apart. One slice each and we were at the end of it. Our salads came and before I could ask for more bread she was gone. My salad was way over dressed. And because it was a vinaigrette I kept coughing at the abundance. I had to chug my magarita cause no waters yet. They called it a chopped salad and I see why. Like litterly every piece of cucumber was a shaving of skin. Its like they peeled the cucumber into my salad. I even had a  lettuce end in my bowl! I wish I would have picked two sides instead of the salad now. margaritas were ok, not to strong but lacking something. I like that they brought out the glass and shaker so you get a little more in your glass. So it was more like one and a half margaritas. But for $9. So on to the meal. Both steaks we asked cooked medium. They were well done with only a little tiny pink in the center. Not a single drop of  juice on my plate or in my mouth. Dry and tough. I don't usually like to complain at a restaurant unless I really need to. I thought about it, but they would probably offer to recook it and we had plans after. Also I know it's hard to eye a steak with out weighing it, but my husband got the 6oz and I got the 8oz, but his looked bigger than mine.   My husband added on shrimp to his. It came with 8 shrimp on two screws on a bit of rice. He shared with me and the rice was good and so were the shrimp. They were cold though, but they do cool fast. I was just so disappointed that a steak house doesn't know how  cook a steak and their so called seasoning sucked. I could tell the waitress knew we were unhappy cause she avoided us like the plague. I think she over heard us talking about how tough they were. She only came back once to quickly grab our plates and said let me take these for you. Never asked how anything was and returned with the bill just setting it and leaving. She was not a good server. Because of the service, food quality and lack of basic cooking skills we will stick to Texas Road house if we want steak at a decent price."}
{"text":"This location should be on the TV show Restaurant Impossible. As soon as you pull into the parking lot, you will notice that it is a ghost town. I'm trying to decide if the poorly maintained parking lot is part of the look and feel of the place.

The food was abysmal. The fried steak was bland and the sweet potato cold. Overcooked salmon and soggy bread. 

Go to Macaroni Grill or Chili's if you're staying in the area."}
{"text":"We decided on Lone Star because my boyfriend wanted to go to a \"real\" steakhouse and it's close to home. We were seated quickly with no wait. Service was good although it did seem to take some time to get our drinks even though it wasn't too busy. The food was good. We both had steaks and my boyfriend inhaled the steak fries with bacon and cheddar. I would most likely come back when I'm in the mood for steak and not in the mood to go too far."}
{"text":"Went out here for date night with my husband after getting a gift card to here. Read the reviews on here before going and just want to emphasize that this place is filthy. The lamp lighting on our table had food splatters caked on to it. Ordered a frozen margarita, ended up having some kind of rubber shredded up in it ( which I don't know how you couldn't see that and still deliver it to the table ) so after they replaced it then I decided that on the rocks would be safer. On the rocks had a fruit fly floating in it when it was delivered. Yum."}
{"text":"The service was below par in the food has no flavor. The host commented on how they are the worst looking Lone Star in the region because corporate have forgot about them."}
{"text":"Two visits.
1st visit:  Steak (ordered medium) was not cooked correctly, but was replaced with one that was cooked correctly after another 10 minutes.  Fish and chips included obviously frozen fish sticks (disappointing). Otherwise, not too bad.

2nd visit:   Ordered salads that never showed up. Waited at least 20 minutes after ordering before we got food (other than rolls with margarine). Asked about salads after 20 minutes and got meals 1 minute later instead. Then salads showed up after our meals and we sent them back.
Ordered medium burger that was very much well done and quite small for the price (maybe 4oz of beef). Ordered medium steak which was cooked correctly (yay!). Ordered Chicken sandwich and got more expensive chicken platter instead (we dealt with it).
We were offered a small discount to make up for salad mix-up, but the salads were still on the bill, so really got no discount at all.

Overall, the service was slow, the food was mediocre at best, and the whole experience was lousy. Go somewhere else. I wish I had."}
{"text":"My Fiance and I went out for my birthday and we were very pleased with our whole dining experience. The staff was excellent we received our food and drinks very quickly. The food was also excellent. I will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"Before today's visit I would have given at least 4 stars.  Maybe it was because I ordered takeout that everything suffered, but for as good as their food and service is while eating there I assumed it would be the same.  First off, they kept me waiting twice as long as predicted on the phone, leaving me to wait ignored at the bar for 15 minutes.  Once home the I found that my steak was extremely over cooked, almost too bad to eat.  Their one saving grace was that the food was still hot when I came home.  I may eat in store again, but I am certain that I will never order out again.  Unfortunate because it would have become a favorite spot to stop on my way home."}
{"text":"Several of us eat here once or twice a month, lunch or dinner.  We have taken this place off our list. Filthy dirty bathrooms, walls and tables. The last time I was there, I pointed out the sticky table with dead flies on it. Had to ask to have it cleaned after we were seated. After the so called table wipe, we picked the remaining fly off and noticed the table was sticky from the varnish or finish on the table being old.  Then the wall the table was against was caked with dried food splatter. Gross and filthy.  Then looking down to the flooring, my feet were sticking to the floor. The benches need new springs and duct tape would help on those rips.  If the dinning room is this gross you know the kitchen is worse.  We will not go till the place gets remodeled and new management.  Sick sick sick. Yes we started noticing the disgusting poor cleaning habits earlier in the year but ignored it. Just glad we didn't get sick."}
{"text":"Run down looking, slow service, server was very nice, food was not good. Waited over 10 minutes for drinks when place was 1/2 full, over 30 min for entrees, delmonicos were not delmonicos, obviously frozen, cooked unevenly, partially over-cooked, partially raw. Mashed potatoes were flavorless, lumpy and cold. I felt bad for the server. Manager had to apologize to several tables around us. We didn't complain. Just paid, tipped the poor girl and left."}
{"text":"My husband and  I were in the area for a long weekend to visit the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. We made the unfortunate choice to eat at Lonestar. We realize that it's a chain restaurant that offers cheaper cuts of meat, but you'd like to be able to at least eat it! The strip steaks were to be cooked medium, in fact were well beyond medium. The server asked us to cut into them and could clearly see they were over cooked. Another server who was nearby came over and commented they were dry and over done. She's the one who jumped in and took care of the situation. Our mustached server, Jim, was unfriendly, snippy, and just   put out that he had to \"deal\" with us. Poor Jim acted like he was paying for our meals out of his own pocket! Look, we weren't trying to get something for nothing just a decent meal that was edible! My husband asked to speak to the Manager. About 15 or 20 minutes later he came to our table already apologizing and saying he took my meal off the bill. My husband had eaten his meal, he felt badly doing so but the guy was hungry! The Manager was nice enough and offered my husband desert on him for having to now wait for my food to be prepared. At the end of it all I asked Jim for a piece of cheesecake as well, my husband took his to go, and believe it or not, Jim had the audacity to say \"that's what's in this box, you mean YOU want a piece too! I replied \"Yes, I do and you can put it on our bill, I'll pay for it! How rude! It was on the bill but then taken off as a \"anniversary desert\". We will never go back to this location ever again! Hey Jim..... Do Lonestar a favor, Quit your day job!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Been going to this location for years.  The food is always great and the price isn't too bad either.  The only thing I would say is a con is the service.  You never know what kind of mood the server will be in or if they will be attentive or not.  This place is delicious if you're looking for steak, or seafood, burgers, etc."}
{"text":"Driving by on my way home one night, pulled in on a whim and ordered  a steak as take out. Pictured dinner without fuss and a little tv. Unfortunately after 2 bites (one for starters and a second to be sure) I threw it in the garbage. Didn't taste fresh - could have been the grill wasn't clean, but not exactly sure.  Just an odd taste. The sweet potato on the side was beyond mushy, almost watery.  Wait staff was nice, but of course that's not enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wrote a note in the bill saying we will not be back. I just want to say that it was due to portion size. Our server, Jeff was great!!"}
{"text":"My experience wasn't bad here. The food wasn't anything amazing but definitely not awful. Our waitress was friendly and the food didn't take too long for it being dinner time on a Thursday. Not as crowded as I thought it would be. The alcohol is pretty cheap too compared to other places."}
{"text":"Meals were perfect. Service was outstanding, which took it from a 4 to a 5. Both waitress and manager came over several times to check on us and drink refills without asking
about"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once each time I'm in town. The service is never disappointing and the staff is very easy on the eyes. The food is always done to perfection. For example, the salmon is always still moist and delicious. The steaks are done exactly the way I ask, every time, even if it's the evening rush."}
{"text":"Funny that there is not a Lone Star Steakhouse in the Lone Star State, but in West Mifflin! We were celebrating a birthday, and Lone Star was the requested stop. It was nice, and quiet for a Saturday, no long waits, and a great server (Dave), who went along with our sense of humor. 

(The pail of peanuts were nowhere to be found, so I'm not sure if they've stopped serving those)

The brown bread was warm and squishy soft, unfortunately the butter too cold to spread. We ordered the Taste of Texas Sampler for starters, the fried onion strings, and the Lone Star skins were the big hits. The hot buffalo chicken tenders, perfect without the hassle of bones.

Main entrees were a few racks of ribs, a Cajun Ribeye, a Peppercorn Ribeye, and a Sweet Bourbon salmon. My Cajun Ribeye was cooked correctly to medium, well seasoned, and 'blackened'. Those who ordered ribs, and the Peppercorn Ribeye (well done) had no complaints about their meats. I did notice the salmon portion seemed small, the baked sweet potato was larger than the fish! That was the only disappointment. 

Nice for a good dinner, even if a real Texas cowboy is nowhere in sight."}
{"text":"I really don't know what people are bitching about. It's a steakhouse, so how is the steak? I've had the porterhouse and the ribeye, both medium rare as a steak should be prepared, and both were excellent cut and quality. I take my steak seriously whether I'm grilling it or ordering it and this place knows how to grill a steak. High heat, salt, cracked pepper, and butter. Perfect. The sides were excellent as well and we've always had friendly service. I'd take Lone Star over Outback any day. I only wish we had a Cattleman's here, but this is the next best option."}
{"text":"Went out to celebrate birthdays and unfortunately will not be returning.  My sangria was incorrectly made and side dishes were all on the wrong plates.  The food was so poorly executed and just tasted pretty bad for that matter. So sad because we just wanted a nice dinner and it was all very sub par."}
{"text":"The New York Strip is their best steak.  The also have a daily $2.99 Margarita happy hour and they are really delicious."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for someone giving us a gift certificate, we wouldn't have chosen to come here.  Not really big on chain restaurants, and I thought this was one of those places with the peanut shells all over the floor.  The ambience is cheesy Texas honky tonk, but the staff was friendly and it wasn't terribly crowded on a Father's Day Sunday.
The food was surprisingly good.  The portions weren't huge, but they were satisfying.  I had the top sirloin with broccoli-cheddar casserole, and another in my party had the delmonico.  Both steaks were well-seasoned, juicy and cooked exactly as requested.  The sides were delicious.  Another of us had chicken tenders, which were served hot and crispy.  My $2.99 Rawhide Rita margarita was PERFECT.  Surprise surprise!  All in all, it was a much better experience than we anticipated.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because I didn't technically get what I paid for.  I placed a to go order for the San Antonio sirloin which is an 8oz steak. I meal prep so I make sure I have the correct portions. I thought it felt a little light and looks a little smaller. So I placed the sirloin on my food scale and it weighed out to 6.4oz.  I called the restaurant spoke to the manager and advised her of this. She told me I can drive back and see if  \"maybe\" they can get me the correct ounce, because the morning Chef's are the ones that weigh and cut it.  I shouldn't have to drive back because of their mistake. It should have been correct the first time.  Super disappointed, and live too far away to drive back for a \"maybe\" i can get what I paid for."}
{"text":"It is a hit or miss with this place in terms of service. Some servers are good and some are not so good. I think there food is very good and I like the new design of the restaurant. They have good specials and the prices are reasonable. I think they need to train their servers better. I would have given it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Rode hard and put away wet. This place needs a serious revamp top to bottom, inside out, including the food. Or just shut 'er down."}
{"text":"Are they going out of business forever?? Worst ever service at formerly very nice dining experience. When we asked for more napkins (twice) a small stack of bar drink napkins were tossed on the table. We had to ask twice for one guest's broccoli casserole, and what was finally delivered was inedible!  Meals came out at widely variable times. Men's bathroom was filthy and one sink was shattered. Floor was ridiculous. This in a Saturday early evening.
We won't be back, despite this being a family favorite for YEARS. 
YUCH."}
{"text":"I'm a steak fan - with a preference for filet mignon. The Lone Star is a good, reasonably priced (about $20 a plate) fix when I really need a filet \"fix\". Service is fairly fast, attentive, and friendly, the beer is really cold, and a cocktail has a bit of a kick. Salad was very crisp and fresh, steak was cook exactly as I markedly requested to my server (a true medium, not cooked medium rare or medium well - so my server was obviously paying attention to me!). As others have remarked, the baked potato was kinda smallish and a little overcooked, but I had the \"works\" with it, so it was edible. Not the best steak dinner, but for the money, pretty good. Recommend."}
{"text":"Good food. Good prices. Good specialty bar drinks. One of the better 'chain' steak joints, for the price."}
{"text":"We had problems here in Jan. Husband got sick. We thought one more chance because we were in the neighborhood and it used to be good, maybe the last experience was a fluke. Fluke puke.  Table was sticky, as mentioned in a prior review. It needs stripped and refinished. The varnish is melting. Very few customers even on a Tuesday night when kids eat free. We stood at the door and witnessed a friend of one of the workers prance around \"choosing\" her table for her and her family while we all stood there like lumps. There were only 8 people in there to begin with. Let me say our young server tried. Not his fault. 2 of our 3 steaks were overcooked, I won't send food back. No way. My elderly MIL could not even chew the supposed filet which I think was not filet but an eye of round, done up with a strip of bacon! Our dogs ate well that night. The Garlic mash was like eating wall paper paste, tosser. 

Now the really fun part. We spent half our time shooing flies. That is never, ever, ever a good thing. I stepped away to the loo and was greeted by a disgusting scene. A charming plunger was parked right by the sink, the floors were 'greasy' and there were big ugly centipedes crawling around on the floor, around the toilets and coming in and out of the drain in the middle of the floor. One crawled on my foot, I screamed, returned to my table (with a few stares from both the other customers on that side of the restaurant) got the check $93.00 wasted dollars!!! And left. Never, ever to return.  

Unbelievable.If there were a negative star rating it would surely apply here."}
{"text":"Recently, the quality of the food and service has gone downhill very, very fast. 

We aren't very picky people and my mother likes her steaks well done, but will suck it up and eat it if there's still a little pink inside. When we were brought her steak, there was still blood coming out of it and it was practically rare on the inside. She politely sent it back to get cooked more- which the server had absolutely no problem doing and was extremely cool about doing, but when they brought it back out it was still nowhere near well done. The only thing they managed to do was burn the outside of the steak. 

The service wasn't as bad as the food, but it was still on the bad side. We sat there and waited for a while on everything, when there were only maybe 5 tables on the whole side of the restaurant. It wasn't 100% our servers fault, I noticed she had to run back a plate or had a problem from pretty much every table she waited on. The more your cook messes up, the more it puts everyone behind. 

This used to be our go-to place because everything was delicious and the service was fantastic, but I'm not sure about what's happening recently."}
{"text":"I went to Lone Star tonight with my friends,for our birthdays. I have been here and the location that closed by the 1-17 many times. I always loved it. Tonight we loved it even more.  From the moments we walked in we were greeted with wonderful sincere smiles.  We were given a fabulous booth with a lovely girl named Desiree.  She brought our drinks right away and took our order with no delay. She even asked if we had questions about the menu or anything else. Which my friend did and she knew all the answers. How wonderful to get such great service! She continually filled our drinks and we did not have to ask.  x x x x x... We also had a visit from the lovely Kera, the manager at Lone Star. She wanted to make sure our visit was perfect,which it was. She was wonderful and pleasant to speak to.  The meals were wonderful, and cooked to perfection. We even had appetizers ,they too were fabulous!   The end of dinner we were given 2 full size desserts as it was our Birthdays, and they were divine!!  Thank you Lone Star for a lovely evening!  Ampule parking in the lot as well."}
{"text":"Our recent trip to Lone Star steakhouse left much to be desired.  We walked in and the restaurant was half-empty, yet the hostess tells us it will be about a ten minute wait until they can clean off a table.  Hello!  The restaurant is half empty and it shouldn't take ten minutes to wipe off a table!  Some people were leaving as we were waiting and handed their check to the hostess, saying they had not seen their waitress in 15 minutes -- so we weren't going in with high expectations.

Overall, the prices were rather high for what you get.  I ordered an 11 oz sirloin for around 16 dollars and if I had wanted any better steak, it would have been well over 20.  You can go next door to Chilis and get the same steak for cheaper or, for that matter, just buy your steak at Wal-Mart and cook at home for a fraction of the cost.

Service was just okay, the food was tasty but pricey, and the management clearly needed to get it together for seating purposes.  I wouldn't go back here unless the other people in the group really wanted to."}
{"text":"The food and service were poor at best. The only thing worth a cent is the mac and cheese. Don't waist your money on this place. I can see it closing down in the next six months."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff! Our waitress was awesome, checked in when we needed her but didnt hound the table. The manager and gm checked with us as well. I reccomend the bacon cheddar mashed potatoes!"}
{"text":"came in for lunch tried the chicken salad it really had no face at all just bland even the Italian dressing had no bit the server was cool hung out and talked about cars  I'll go back and get a burger for lunch"}
{"text":"Great lunch specials, fast service as we go to work after and have limited time. We joined the lunch club so every 5th lunch is free."}
{"text":"Very overpriced for what you get, and the food is OK. They market themselves as a high end steakhouse, but it is really the McDonalds of steakhouses. If you are one of the mindless masses that is ok with mediocrity and believes all the commercials, then this place is for you. If you have taste buds of your own, a brain that is critical of what you see, and appreciate truely good food, then you will not like this mega-chain restaurant at all."}
{"text":"Best stake house I've ever been to. It's worth the drive from chandler. Everything is seasoned to perfection and the staff and manager are amazing. I recommend this place wether it's a family night out, date or business dinner. Whatever the occasion is, this place is perfect for it."}
{"text":"They had amazing steak and our waiter was so nice! I wish I remembered his name, I think he said he was from the Midwest? Either way he was such a gentleman and had so much patients with our baby."}
{"text":"Steak was not cooked properly. After the second attempt still wrong
.. gave up.  

Good sweet potato though!

Not my most favorite place for steak."}
{"text":"We visited Lone Star on Saturday night because we were in the mood for steak, but chose a chain restaurant to not break the bank. We kept an open mind and knew it was possible that it would not be as good as some of the high end steak houses. Being that we were not in a hurry, we ordered a drink and enjoyed an appetizer - spinach and artichoke dip. This came recommended by our server and he was spot on...it was delicious. So much so that we had to stop ourselves from eating it all. Next, we decided on our entrees...ribeye for both please!  The flavor was outstanding! Cooked to perfection and the sides were just as good. I opted for the garlic mashed potatoes and four cheese mac and cheese. There was far too much food so we packed up leftovers to go. 

After reading some of the reviews, we were hesitant to go, but took a chance. Our service was outstanding; seated immediately and didn't have to wait to place a drink order; Steven, our server was prompt and very friendly - shared his favorites when we asked for recommendations (this is rare at times) and left us to enjoy our meal...while checking in periodically. Overall this was a great meal and a great experience...we will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped here last night for dinner.  The service was super fast and the waitress was friendly. The redneck lemonade was delicious.  Our Texas rose was slightly under cooked but everything else was delicious.  I had grilled shrimp and my boyfriend had a steak and both entrees were cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I've been to Lone Star now several times and I have yet to be disappointed!  

I have always found the servers to be very friendly and well organized.   The place itself is a typical chain restaurant, so you're going to get that casual relaxed vibe. 

I ordered the Delmonico steak on my first visit and love it so much, I haven't tried anything else... yet.   The Delmonico is perfectly seasoned, tender, juicy, and oohh sooo delicious!   The baked sweet potatoes are enormous and have the right amount of butter and brown sugar.  The creamed spinach is also delicious.

My friends have gotten a variety of items... from the BBQ ribs to the smaller steaks and chicken... and have always been very pleased with their meals.  

The margaritas are great, too! 

We've always been perfectly satisfied with the amount of food we've gotten and haven't made it to the desserts... yet."}
{"text":"Horrible. This review is from June 5, 2014.  I remember very vividly, the food was horrible! My husband and I went there during lunch time, I ordered a steak (duh) and he had a burger. The steak was extremely thin, looked like some ordinary boring cheap piece of fried beef.  AND it lacked lots of seasoning and color! The manager saw how unhappy I was by the way I was picking at my food, politely asked and I politely told her.  She was nice enough to offer another in which I declined (I can only suffer so much through this horrible food!), well, she took it off the bill thank god......  

Drinks were fair, service mediocre, atmosphere boring and smelled like old people.  
Never again."}
{"text":"OK I might be picky. But when a party of four goes to a steakhouse I expect to see steaks on the tables. But these steak prices are nuts for a casual dinner spot, as were the The four plates on the table all together consisted of less than 18 oz of beef. Pretty sad for a steakhouse if you ask me. 

But I will say this for the place. The staff and management was nice except for the one waiter lacking manners and reaching over me and across my plate to hand off condiments to my dining partner. 

The staff is quick to refill your glasses. Friendly and otherwise thoughtful. 
I might not come there for a meal again but I would consider it a decent place for appetizers and drinks. So the Saloon might just become a favorite watering hole for me from time to time."}
{"text":"Came back for my bday, for the free entree. If you sign up for their emails you will get a free entree on your birthday!  The restaurant was clean, service was good. I will be back, I feel like they listened to my cries. The manager was around, friendly, and on top of everything."}
{"text":"Have been eating at this restaurant for years on end and have experienced 1st hand the decline in food quality.

Just paid $30.00 for a ribeye that I just couldn't eat. Tough as a leather boot, and the waitress said she hand picked it for me since I shared my prior poor experience with her.

The place is clean. The staff is friendly. Unfortunately the food quality has gone down hill to the point I doubt I will go back."}
{"text":"We got there and the place was empty. We were seated right away, which was a plus. But now the negatives! My wife ordered a dirty martini, well they bring her a plain martini not dirty at all! Then the waitress says I'm sorry and takes it back. Well no manager no one comes to ask about the service or apologize for the bad drink. Then the waitress keeps trying to sell us on a cheesecake special that she keeps calling it by the wrong name! Know your product before trying to sell it!"}
{"text":"You people that rip apart restaurants need to get a life. Your stupid opinions directly effect the livelihood of everyone who works there."}
{"text":"Family of five had a great dinner!  Our server Brandon was attentive and polite.  I observed the manager making her rounds and she stopped to check on us twice.  My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor.  We will return soon!"}
{"text":"Convenient, safe, easy, anonymous. Perfect for an illicit tryst away from anyone you might know."}
{"text":"Really great food but terrible service. Heaven forbid you arrive an hour before they close on a Sunday. Prepare to be rushed and treated like dirt!

Maybe the restaurant should post 10:00pm but tell their employees to expect to be here until 11:00. 

If somebody walks in at 9:45 what are you going to do? Turn them and their money away?"}
{"text":"Food was bland,  place was filthy. Wiped grease off table and the napkin waa literally black with filth"}
{"text":"I came here for the very first time yesterday. We came in for lunch.
 We were greeted and seated right away, in a cozy little booth.
However, before we eat we went to wash our  hands. The water in the bathroom is over the top hot. A child could really burn themselves on it. (Just a side note there).
Anyway back to the food, The lunch choices are very good!
We both had the Burgers,with cheese and veg. Fries are good Steak fries,nice and thick. We also tried the Potato soup ,which was also good. Drink refills were abundent!
Lots of parking in the lot and easy to get to right on Camelback.
By the way, this is the only one left in the Valley now. The others have all closed."}
{"text":"Went on Mother's Day with wife and family.
Steaks were average for the price. Very good service. Chocolate cake very good, but overpriced. Good middle level family steakhouse."}
{"text":"Third time we've been to this location haven't been disappointed yet.

Steak tonight was so flavorful and tender enough to cut with a fork."}
{"text":"This Location is closed about a week ago. 
We used to stop here once a month. was one of the few places left to get a good steak at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Quick lunch before a business meeting on a Friday really didn't satisfy me. Ordered the Delmonico Sandwich, which was slightly overcooked. I asked MidRare and got MidWell. Colleagues ordered 8oz Sirloin and each were thoroughly disappointed in how it was cooked and the cut of meat itself. 

I will give a +1 for the server and manager checking on us periodically.

Honestly, I didn't have high expectations but when it comes to ordering steak at a steakhouse I would think they'd have a bit more skill. Sorry, Lone Star. Definitely not impressed and will not return."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm surprised that this place got such high reviews; perhaps we came in on a night that they were having a not so good day. 

The food tasted reheated; that's the only way to describe it. Reheated in the microwave is what it tasted like and it tasted old. the baked potato shouldn't taste like that. I have had better baked potatoes from my microwave and this was bad. my meat was over cooked and not seasoned well at all. My boyfriend stated that it was under par for him as well. We will not come back, ever, and we certainly do not tell anyone about this place either. I'd rather go home and BBQ then spend the money for reheated meat and potatoes. 

Service was, eh."}
{"text":"We went to lone star mentor we arrived and the hostess had no record of us calling ahead.
 We used the call ahead wait list on new years eve. .at this point there was a two hour wait
Seeing was new yrs we felt all restaurants were crowded.i went to bathroom and counted 17 open tables. Probably they were short on servers. 2 hours and 15 minutes later we were seated. We ordered our drinks with which came shortly and we rushed our server to place our orders we all ordered steak and all came back so overdone that we couldn't eat them and it took them 45 additional minutes to get our food we paid the bill and left we couldn't find anyone to complain to"}
{"text":"Good service.  Overpriced, mediocre food.  $6 dollars for a short rum and diet with hardly any rum in it.  $5 for a store bought slice of apple pie that was so tiny."}
{"text":"So for starters it took 12 MINUTES BEFORE ASKING IF WE WANTED ANYTHING TO DRINK, how do you stay in business??? Then to add insult to injury, you don't have brisket....WHAT BBQ PLACE DOESNT SELL BRISKET???? I don't think anything else can get worse...

Food was way better but menu had next to nothing left on it since there's a new menu coming June 10!!!! But its not June 10 yet so why no brisket and why only brownie and cheesecake for dessert???? Could have been better but to brand with Texas I'd expect the staples of Texas BBQ...brisket and pecan pie"}
{"text":"Ordered a Texas size Rib eye steak, medium that was right on! Cold beer, good service recommend"}
{"text":"I'm a fan. Good food. I love this restaurant's pork chops and chicken wing appetizers.  Good service. I often report their excellent service to the restaurant's website contact link."}
{"text":"6oz sirloin, salad, boatload of steamed broccoli and a glass of wine less than $20..yep, it happened!  Thanks Cleveland for my parting gift!!!"}
{"text":"I freekin love this place!  Great big mug of draft and a whopin huge steak - what's not to love?  The steak is always cooked to perfection.  Very generous portions.  The blue cheese wedge salad (not on the menu but available if you know to ask) is perfect.  Place is clean.  Staff is friendly and professional.  Nice and quick.  Best of all... the price.  Easy on the budget.  Maybe I love Lonestar so much because I just forked out $160 for a tiny little bite of steak, a tiny drink and a sprig of something green at a posh spot in Scottsdale.  Get me back to Lonestar!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good and so was the waitress but they blasted rock and roll music??? Really wouldn't they play country? Probably won't return here."}
{"text":"Nothing different than the other reviews. My husband really likes steak so we went here. Service wasn't good. They were pretty short and no very nice or welcoming. Felt like they didn't even want our business. Waitress paid little attention to us... But she also looked miserable. Food was meh, steak wasn't cooked right (they asked my husband to check it ha undoubtably it happens a lot since the other tables around us weren't happy with the cook on theirs either) but pretty pricey for what you're getting. I was a little shocked with how much the bill ended up being with a salad and an entree. Not a wide variety of things to eat but it's a steakhouse so oh well."}
{"text":"Staff was wonderful.  Server, Amanda did a great job.  My NY Strip was a little overdone for my taste, husbands ribeye was done to perfection.  Large portion fresh salad, baked potato was big and done perfectly.  Restaurant was very clean.  Next time I will get the ribeye steak."}
{"text":"The food here was very good. I had the Bubba Steak Burger which had lots of BBQ sauce on it, which I liked. My dad had the Delmonico Steak, which he said was on the tough side, but had good flavor. For me, the facility itself was iffy. Still good food."}
{"text":"My first visit here. I am not much of a steak eater, so  I ordered the fish and chips, which came with steak fries and a side. My son had steak and a baked potato.

Service was prompt and friendly.  My house Margarita was fine - heavy on the mix, light on tequila - but that is how I like them.   Food came quite quickly, although it should have, since the place was  nearly empty, even for a Tuesday.  

The food was mediocre at best.  My salad was okay, but nothing special. The thick-cut fries were limp, pale, and soggy.  The crust of the beer-battered fish was dense instead of light, and crispy, but fried almost too dark, although underneath it was actually soggy and raw.  Either the fish itself or the tartar sauce had an odd flavor, not like spoilage, just a little peculiar.

Three stars for good service and pleasant atmosphere; the food on its own would get two. I just moved right around the corner and am excited about all the restaurant choices, but this will not be one of my go-to places."}
{"text":"I ordered the peppercorn ribeye, and it turned out nicely. Tons of pepper, and a delicious brandy cream dipping sauce. With the price right in the mid range, they put out a good product.

I also got the potato soup and rice, along with bread, all of which were good, about what you'd expect.

Not the fanciest place around, but definitely a good place to go if you're just looking for a good steak dinner."}
{"text":"Service here is awful.  Came in to a not so busy restaurant and was never seated, even after 3 groups of people came in after us.  They seemed to have a lot of people doing nothing.  I wouldn't recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants, my mom enjoyed coming here especially because she was from Texas and like to have one lone Star beer, she could never finish a whole bottle, lol... even though they were known for their steaks I truly enjoyed the chicken. Heartbreaking it was a perfect location, 18th St. and Camelback :("}
{"text":"Great food! We got the filet without the bacon wrapped around it and the ribs. Both were very delicious! They come with two sides as well! Didn't like the Mac and cheese but the baked potato was amazing (with all of the add ons). The waitress was slow, but extremely friendly. We had long waits until she would come back to check on us. She also forgot our bread. Beer was good, had bottled IPA. Can't go wrong with an IPA. Overall, great restaurant! Dress is casual. Seated right away, but it was a weeknight. Will be back and recommend!"}
{"text":"I give three stars because it wasn't horrible. My food was edible so eating here is not completely out of the question. There is nothing that makes me want to come back. 

My experience started with a host who was friendly and seated us with no wait. I asked her a question about the special written on the chalkboard she was unable to answer. Not a big deal I don't expect the host to know the menu. I came solo with my two kids we got settled and the server took our drink order. He seemed less than enthusiastic about giving any suggestions other than the house margarita that was on special. I took him up on his suggestion and got what I expected. A standard run of the mill house marg which I poured some of my corona in to change it up. I  went with the 6oz sirloin and half rack of ribs. The steak was ok, low expectations from a chain. The ribs on the other hand were comparable to jerky. Over cooked and under sauced. This was my servers suggestion to get the ribs. I know this guy has never tried these ribs because if he had it would be the last thing out of his mouth. I can get a meal at hundreds of establishments. This server must think business falls from the sky as opposed to being built on customer service and food quality. I am disappointed at the lack of passion this individual possesses. I was hoping for an experience that warranted a repeat visit.   This restaurant is under achieving. I hope this review prompts a server meeting about guest relations."}
{"text":"Filet mignon was tough... Steamed green beans are cold and mushy... Steak fries were good and so was the sangria"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I'd been to a Lone Star and I really had no memories of the experience, so a few friends and I decided to try it out as it was the nearest steakhouse to our location.

We were extremely disappointed. Although the service was just fine and the bread & cheese fries were tasty, the rest of the food was either wholly unremarkable or completely unsatisfactory.

I ordered the 8 oz. sirloin (so cold and purple throughout that it could walk off the plate on its own; I know, go ahead and make a face...), with sautéed mushrooms and a house salad (no onions, extra ranch dressing) as my sides.

The salad was very plain and had nothing about it to distinguish it from any other salad anywhere (including one you would make at home or one that you would get from any buffet salad bar anywhere in the nation). I did not expect the salad to be the highlight of the meal, but usually there is something (a spiced up ranch dressing, flavored croutons, etc) that add to uniqueness of a 'house' salad. Not this time. Meh.

When my entrée showed up, the steak was warm, light pink throughout, rubbery, and absolutely flavorless. No rub, no marinade, and the cut had clearly either been recently frozen or sitting in a fridge for an extended period of time because the flavor of oxidation was rife. Please note that I never expect there to be marinades or rubs on a steak, but then I do expect the cut to stand up on its own (which it did not in this case).

The sautéed mushrooms were particularly disappointing. I love sautéed mushrooms. Adore them. I require nothing more than a little butter or oil on them and then just go to town in that pan! The mushrooms I received were a mix of mushrooms that had been sautéed to the point of shriveled brown lumps and those that had been held over a warm microwave for 15 seconds. On top of this odd culinary spectrum, there seemed to be nothing but water on them, which didn't do anything to assist in the flavor. A quarter through the meal, I'd had enough and claimed a full tummy (a white lie... forgive me).

Although the server was kind and competent, the food was a severe let down and I would never return to this or any other location. Sorry, Lone Star."}
{"text":"Sometimes ordering to go is just easier then actually sitting down at a restaurant for a meal. That being said I've had take home from here 3x now and have physically gone in 2x including the time from my first review. Each time I've had food from here there's been something wrong. Weather it be no steak in my steak queso which happened again last night!! Or weather it be a steak undercooked or cinnamon sugar missing from a sweet potato that comes with cinnamon sugar.  

All that side over all the food is very good. It's by no means poor quality and the portions are reasonable for a steak house. I chalk the missing steak up to it falling to the bottom of whatever container they take it from and the person who puts it into the dish just takes from the top. 

Now for the staff our waitress this vast time we went in could have listened a bit better. The other half asked for a beer and she just walked away. Also when we were ordering my sons kids meal we ordered applesauce and told her 3x as she just listed off possible sides.  We also spoke to a very friendly manager who went out of her way to correct the issues we've had over the last several meals. She was genuinely interested in what they should have done better to make the dining experience more enjoyable. F it wasn't for her this would still be a 2 star review."}
{"text":"Been here lots and this wasn't the best. Meat (filet mignon) just not the quality it usually is"}
{"text":"As of January 20, 2017 this West Mifflin location is permanently closed. 

There was a sign posted on the door."}
{"text":"The food was bland and when the main course came out, it had hair all over the plate.  Never going back"}
{"text":"Every time that we go here, we have great service and great food!!!

PROS:
Beef (need I say more? LOL)
Really great service (consistently)
Really great food (consistently)
...and who doesn't love a big 'ol bucket o' peanuts? (which you'll get here)

CONS:
(none, really)
One might argue that price is a con, but really... where else are you going to go for the same type of food cheaper?  Steak houses are all quite comparable.

ATMOSPHERE:
because its a country-type steakhouse, there is lots of horse/ranch decor on the walls and if you don't like country music... this will be a looooong meal for you.  They play nothing but country in this restaurant.
Otherwise, very casual.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
Filet Mignon (Medium--Perrrfect!)
The Spinach-Artichoke Dip (ammmaaazing and has a great spicy kick!)
\"Pecos Peach\" (a very tasty liquor drink that you will love--if you like peach)  Yum!    ;)"}
{"text":"Love the Delmonico! For those who know what a Delmonico is and what it is suppose to be, it is very good! Cheese and Bacon fries are second to none! Its not a fancy place, but is worth going to!"}
{"text":"Living close by we eat here quite often, I usually order the bubba burger or the chopped steak because they cook it exactly the way I like meat, bloody. I do wish they offered a plain mashed potato rather than the garlic mashed, I am not too much of a potato skin fan unless it's a baked tater. The service here is always excellent but I do have to agree on a busy day the parking lot is quite a challenge. I think $6.29 for 5 extra grilled shrimp is kind of pricey, especially if you've spent a small fortune on dinner. I recommend the 2 for $25 meal if they still have it available. They have taken feedback and expanded what they offer for the specials menu. The spinach and artichoke dip is a pretty tasty appetizer."}
{"text":"I stopped over at Lone Star for a quick lunch yesterday. The food was brought out very quickly after I told our server I was pressed for time. The Pork Chop was juicy and very tasty; I could have wolfed down another Pork Chop (it was that good). The gigantic Sweet Potato was delicious when coupled with a little bit of butter and cinnamon. I love their salads, but didn't have a chance to order one since I was in a hurry. The drinks are refilled on a timely basis. Lunch for two was about $22 before tip."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate zero stars. Mediocre service was the highlight of the night. Terrible draft beer selection (4 options, all domestic). Our chips and queso appetizer was cold and had chunks of steak in it that were also cold in the middle. We were one of probably 4 other tables, so I don't see how they can justify serving cold food. Both of the entrees at the table were OK but forgettable, and I had to ask for cheese on my sandwich that was supposed to come with. 

We left as soon as possible. There are so many great places to eat in the area and this one is worth skipping - probably my worst PGH meal in at least the last year."}
{"text":"Service tried to hard- 6 visits between manager and waitress. Waitress nice but screed up our orders and didn't even realize she delivered wrong items. Food dry and flavor less . Overall waste of time and money. Portions so small .... Salad was fresh and tea tastes good , hence the 1 Star"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! Good food, reasonable and not usually busy. The only reason for 4 stars is the service isn't consistent. Sometimes it's stellar, and others it's lacking. One of my biggest peeves about restaurants is having to wait to get your check or waiting for them take to it. We waited about 10 minutes yesterday after the checks were dropped off. I had to ask someone to get our server for us. Why do you have to wait to pay??? I hate that, especially when you need to get back to work. I have one of their lunch cards, where you get a free lunch after you purchase 6. I had been going there for a long time before they even told me about it. I had a free one yesterday and the server totally missed it, so I had to wait longer for her to rectify it. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place. I just wish it was more consistent with the service."}
{"text":"Nice. Liked it a lot. Food is always super hot and fresh, and the service is generally good. Beef was of good quality for that price point."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. I have never had a bad steak from this restaurant. I usually order my steak medium rare, but will accept anything from rare up to medium with anything over that being ruined.

They seem to always get it right. Last night was one of the better steaks I have had. I like a good rib-eye and I had the delmonico. it was perfect. My wife had the Bourbon Salmon and she said hers was done perfectly as well.

The only thing I do not particularly like is that a manager or someone like that (not the waiter) comes around asking about our meal, I find this really annoying. 

All restaurants try to sell you on desert, I know the reasons why, but I really wish this and other restaurants would stop pushing deserts. Good god, they give you enough food with out the temptation of desert.

They have a good selection of sides, but I would like to see grilled asparagus as a choice, since I don't care much for broccoli."}
{"text":"Always A Great Meal.

I have been to Lone Star Steakhouse on Camelback on several occasions and have never been disappointed.  Lone Star Steakhouse's has a casual and inviting atmosphere and is known for their outstanding customer service  and memorable meals.

Lone Star Steakhouse has so many delicious entrées to select from.  There are  steaks which are delicious and reasonably priced. The burgers are large and cooked to perfection and the ribs will melt in your mouth. If beef isnt for you, then you have to select a chicken entrée.  The sidewinder chicken sandwich is always  an excellent choice whether served as a sandwich or as an entree.  

 The entrees are well worth the price, at under $15 (depending on the entree).  The service is excellent and the staff is friendly and accomdating.  The manager's makes themselves  avaliable to their guest, as they walk around the dining area ensuring their guest are having a pleasant  dining experience.

If you find yourself in the area give Lone Star Steakhouse a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My family had an absolutely fantastic meal at Lonestar Steakhouse in Monroe NC.  The maple glaze pork chops are out of this world!!  The service was fantastic.  We were seated immediately upon entry.  This wonderful steakhouse seems to have been forgotten."}
{"text":"I really fucking hate places like Lone Star. 

As you can tell from the name, the cheap gimmicky theme here is \"Texas\". You have stupid waitresses walking around with cowboy hats and t-shirts that say \"Don't Mess with Texas!\" and who are instructed to say \"Howdy y'all!\" when you walk in. The food is a notch above Burger King, if that. The decor is the same shit they plaster over every other restaurant of this genre, but with slight variations for Greek (My Big Fat Greek Restaurant), Mexican (Macayo's), and Just Plain Stupid-Ass (TGI Friday's). So yeah, this is basically the Texas equivalent of TGI Fridays. Does that appeal to you? Does it turn you on? Then please, go there, eat your stupid generic burger/burrito/gyro/chicken tenders and leave me the hell alone. Just please, please, I beg you, never force me to come here again the way you did today."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I went to a Lone Star (no offense-just not really on my radar) and will probably be an even longer time before I go back. While the service was adequate our server didn't really interact with us-she was sort of like a zombie server and just showed up to take our order, bring us our drinks and bring us our card back. Don't get me wrong-I'm not looking for a bestie at my table but the only thing drier was the steak-my friend ordered a filet and I a San Antonio Sirloin. Our meats were tough and dry-so much so that we barely ate half and didn't even bother to bring it home. Next time I'll find an Outback or TX Roadhouse (my friend likes chain steakhouses-I like the independents but am happy to compromise). The sweet potato was smaller then the cinnamon and sugar served on top. My salad, though tiny-was spot on! Do yourself a favor and pass on this place. Your pallet and wallet will appreciate it."}
{"text":"I went to Lone Star for a friend's post-graduation lunch this past weekend.  The service was attentive, but my meal was decidedly \"meh.\"  When the waitress asked how I wanted my burger, I asked her if they could do medium.  She assured me they could, but what I received was way past well-done.  I'm used to getting well-done burgers by this point, but this was dang near burned.

I guess this explains why, even with the fairly limited dining options in Monroe, this place is always half-empty."}
{"text":"This place is so bad words might not be able to compensate for the experience i have had. The servers, while nice, are completely unprepared to fulfill the expectations of those served. 

In three separate visits i have had over cooked steak, undercooked salmon,
And most recently the single food item ordered completely forgotten. In every instance i have been made to feel like I'm trying to dupe or rip off the waitstaff or management. 

This has to be the most filthy restaurant I've ever had the displeasure of eating in.

Never Never Never going back and i tell everyone i know about the experiences I've had."}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse in the Pittsburgh area. The interior design is a little out dated but the food was fantastic! Our server was prompt and polite. The steak I ordered was cooked to perfection & the strawberry cheese cake was exquisite."}
{"text":"I do not favor the corporate monolithic steakhouse; but managers Joe & Cara absolutely make this place feel like your mother's dining room.  They are caring, smiling, nice to my kids, happy to see us, and genuinely seem to like their jobs.  Their attitudes influence their own staff and guests, it can be zany crazy, busy w/45-minute waits, to-go orders, screaming kids...nothing throws this crew off.

Lucky to have you Joe and Cara!"}
{"text":"Great server. Decent food. We got a giftcard for xmas so we stopped in for dinner. I had a ribeye sammy and my wife had a salad. Nothing remarkable here except our lil girl got to eat free since it was Tuesday -a free petite filet & fresh broccoli at that.?"}
{"text":"I go to Lone Star in West Mifflin often.  They have a great selection of steaks, and in varying portion sizes.  The quality of the steaks is average, definitely not the best quality cuts but that said, worth what you pay for and without the long wait of other steak houses.  They have awesome French onion soup and salad wedges too.  My favorite steak there is the Delmonico."}
{"text":"Adequate food adequate price take out dessert was cold with no hints on how to reheat. 

Sadly better than Macaroni grill next door. There's a reason least crowded of all the places in neighborhood."}
{"text":"Not my usual suspect but sometimes you need a good, quick reasonably priced take out option. These guys delivered a mean pork chop with steamed broccoli with great service."}
{"text":"Okay food, not the best I've eaten. Good place for lunch though, food was on my table super fast. 

Service was good, just enough amount of attention to the guest. 

Parking turn out a little challenge, as the lot isn't that big and lunch time...well it was more of 14:00, it was still packed."}
{"text":"The steak quality is inconsistent.  Also the NY strip steak at their place is boneless.  If you're a Midwesterner like myself, I was looking at it like it was an imposter of the real thing.  Staff is ok, but the place seems like it's got the we are not a big deal vibe.  My steak was ok but for the $20
Something charged, I could get two steaks from Safeway and the quality would be significantly better. On a positive note the strawberry lemonade was really tasty but then it could have been my slight hangover from the night before.  Other options are better at this price point"}
{"text":"So we made a big mistake calling wrong restaurant honking it was lonestar and found out when our togo order was not available at this location; however the manager stepped in and got our order asap and did everything in his power to accommodate us! Thanks again for the great customer service"}
{"text":"Hillbilly Heaven, first the girl who greeted and sat us looked like a walrus. Then we meet our server, who had to be some kind of joke, she looked terrible, had black teeth and was super slow. 

Then after asking about their drink specials, she tells us the happy hour times (at it was not happy hour...). Finally when our food arrives, we had to order a beer to get ourselves through this miserable experience. 

While our bill only came to $21, I have to say you get what you pay for, (however, I don't think they charged us for the redneck atmosphere) :)"}
{"text":"1st of all we was in a rush to eat and stop there since the parking lot wasn't pack on a saturday.So when we got seated i look around and i see somewhat about 5-7 tables filled. Which was good, since i was in a rush but then i take a look at the menu and the price was just to overprice.i didnt think any 12oz ribeye was worth $18 so i decided to order half a rack of bbq ribs which was decent.So after 20-30 mins of waiting our food came which was some what warm tasted okay i say but thru out our meals we never had our waiter asked us how was our meal or to see if i needed any water. After we finish our meal we sat there for another 10 mins and had to ask another waiter for our check. So in the end i had the worst experience ever i rather go to texas road house over this place."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE, OVER PRICED! Butter to cold to spread on bread. Salad dressing watered-down, lettuce was old. Filet mignon was undercooked asked for medium got bloody rare. No seasoning on steak.  Shrimp was old and rubbery. Husbands steak was all fat and grisly. Green beans where rubbery. Texas rose was dripping in grease. WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN, I can get a better meal at taco bell."}
{"text":"I ordered the $12.99 special that came with bleu cheese topped sirloin (the best medium rare I have had in years!), a house salad and cheesecake for dessert. Great service. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Pop quiz... what does a guy from the Midwest get when going to a Steakhouse.... yeah the only green on my plate is garnishment buddy. I come for steak and carbs and this place doesn't disappoint. I went on vacation with a friend and searched around the internet for a good place B.Y.E (before our yelp era) and just stumbled across this place being close to where we're staying at so really didn't know what to expect. The environment inside is like the old west so lots to look at in wonderment. We were immediately greeted coming in, promptly seated, and had the best waitress I've ever had the pleasure meeting. She was funny, personable, attentive, and made the experience even better. Yeah yeah I know your thinking \"she works off tips!!!\" But I'm from Cali and not all waitress staff are created equal. The ribeye steak was the BEST steak I have ever had. Cooked perfectly. Sides were fresh and hot and refills were performed before I even had to ask. This place was soo good we went back again on another trip to the Grand Canyon. 

Overall, a SOLID steakhouse to hit while your in town and worth every penny. I agree with the other yelper, the BIG con is they are not in North Cali. =)"}
{"text":"Nice building. My burger was okay.  I think they use margarine not real butter.  My sweet potato had a burnt taste all through it.  Service was super slow and the servers were difficult to track down."}
{"text":"Arrived early around 5.  Texas rose was salty but the onion under the breading was superb - - sweet as can be!  The appetizer was cooked to perfection Ordered Margherita on the rocks, nothing special.   Came here with friends and they were impressed with wait staff. Very attentive to all needs.   

Demonico and ribeye were excellent.   The bacon wrapped filet was thin and tough on the perimeter but tender on the inside.   Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"This is another chain steakhouse.  This one in particular just underwent some new updates to the exterior and interior so it feels fresh and new!  Dropped in here for dinner last night, got the steak salad with blue cheese and let me warn you...it's a LARGE salad!  No worries I finished it off without delay.  The girlfriend got a sirloin steak sandwich with slices of beef so good she raved about it.  

The service was quick to the table and kept up perfectly.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"A generous 3 star only because the service was great. The food, however, was mediocre at best! The center cut sirloin, my wife and I ordered, was tuff and chewy as was the ribeye my sister-in-law ordered. The shrimp that came with the sirloin dinner was very small in size. One of our quests ordered the salmon and she said it was great! Since this is a \"steak house\" we left disappointed! We won't be back! :-("}
{"text":"I got the Delmonico steak with a bake potato and chili. My family also got the Texas rose and cheese fries for appetizers. My steak was horrible!! Tasted like rubber.  The Texas rose  wasn't  cut properly, but the flavor was ok. The cheese fries and bake potato were good. Chili was so so. My family and I were the only people in the restaurant. I don't know how much longer it will stay open."}
{"text":"This is the only place I found that will actually prepare my steak rare. They have a fabulous ribeye!! Definitely a great place to relax, have a couple drinks, and enjoy friends and a great steak!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with both Pierre and Donald. However there are 2 menu items worth ordering. I get them togo all the time for lunch. The lettuce wedge and the willy burger. The steaks are awful! They put some crap they describe a seasoning that is so overpowering you can't eat it. Also someone needs to teach the cook the difference between Med rare and Well. I know I know that is a big difference but when I ordered the rib-eye med rare I got a hockey puck! Sidebar the bread is really good when you get it hot. 

The wrap up burgers are good and the lettuce wedge rocks, skip the steaks!"}
{"text":"I am giving the place 3 stars due to how nice the manager and waitress were.  The food, it's really a 1 1/2 star. 

Ordered the ribeye- cooked well.  Mashed potatoes loaded, cold.  The steak had a ton of fat and gristle.  It lacked overall flavor.

The salad- Caesar was lacking flavor and was just not very good. Due to the dressing which they supposedly just changed.

The bread was kind of cold and the butter for it was rock hard so it of course destroys the bread.

The dessert was actually pretty good.  Brownie with ice cream but they were having issues with the whipped cream for whatever reason.  

So for my first time, not great.  Will I go back, probably not."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place, but it was right next to my hotel and I was STARVING, so off we went.  It was the day before Thanksgiving at around 4:00 and it was empty.  Empty as in me and my parents were the ONLY people in the restaurant!  :P  Good for us, as service was fast.

I had the 6oz sirloin with a Ceasar salad and garlic potatoes.  The manager (??) who gave us our plates even took the time to make sure our steaks were all cooked properly and they were (medium rare, yay!)  Anyways, it was your basic chain store steak, nothing fancy, just average and filling.  The garlic potatoes, average (but how can you mess up something like mash potatoes?)  Was not a fan of the Ceasar salad as I'm one of those freaks that actually like anchovies and there were none.

Honorable mention to the $2.99 Margaritas!  All day everyday!  Large and pretty damn tasty!  Two of those and I was walking out with a little extra \"pep\" in my step.  All in all, service was nice, food was decent and it was cheap.  I think there's one of these in Gurnee, IL, but I doubt I'd ever make the trip out there for it.  But if you're in the neighborhood, give it a go.  $2.99 margaritas!!  Duh!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good!  I had baby back ribs & fries, and both were very flavorful. The ribs were extremely tender, and the fries had an excellent seasoning on them. The service was decent - it was a pretty quiet time of day when we were there - but attentive."}
{"text":"Had the Delmonico sandwich. The best sirloin I've had in a long time and I'm from Alberta where Black Angus is the gold standard. The Chili was proper. Texas atmosphere and decor with good ol country music is the cherry on top. Very friendly staff. All around a place I would frequent."}
{"text":"I felt like steak and didn't want to spend a fortune so I gave this place a try. 
I ordered a Delmonico (aka boneless rib eye) with a garden salad and baked potato with butter and sour cream. I started with a rolling rock for $2 a bottle.

The salad tasted ok but they overdressed it. (ranch) There was also a loaf of dark bread and whipped butter. It was tasty but I've had better. 

Just before my steak and potato came out, the waiter asked if I wanted another rolling rock, I told him I'd try a pint of draft PBR which a sign on the table said was also $2. He suggested I get a large 21oz serving of PBR for only $3. I told him there are 16 ounces in a pint and for $2, that was a better deal. So he brought me one and my food. 

The steak was good. I ordered medium rare and it was. I finished it all. I'd say it was equivalent to a steak from Fry's Grocery Store. Not mind blowing, but good. I was satisfied considering the menu price was under $20 with 2 sides. 

I noticed when the bill came, the waiter didn't add my second beer. That was cool. 
The food was good but not amazing. I probably won't be back anytime soon. I didn't care for the loud country music. For a casual steak place, I like Outback's atmosphere better, but Lone Star was A-OK."}
{"text":"We rarely go to chains but we were in the area and yelped this spot. I came across the pic of the wedge salad with steak and instantly craved it! It was tasty and filling. My son got the chicken tenders and fries and rated it a 10 out of 10. Even better, and we didn't know this until we got the check, but my sons meal was free...we went on a Tuesday and there was no advertisement for kids eat free so not sure what days they do this, but it was an extra perk for us:) if I'm craving another steak salad I will be back for sure! And the fries and ranch are amazing!!"}
{"text":"So it was my friends birthday and a bunch of us were gonna go out for dinner.  We had planned another place, but didnt feel like waiting 2 hours and opted here next.

We all sat down at a large table and our waitress came over and seemed to be stressed from the get-go.  That doesnt always go over well when you're there to have a great time.  So we were thinking of what to drink and she left and said \"be right back.\"  I think she must of said that to us about 10 times that night.

Once we got our appetizers and drinks, and placed our order she seem to be in a better mood.  Not sure if she was stressin' from somewhere else, but we were joking around and I guess the jokes just were not funny. Who knows..

We got our dinner and it was ok really.. nothing amazing.  My friend got a salad that seemed to be 90% lettuce with a dash of veggies.  

I still give it 3 stars because I love their porkchops and another friend said her fish was really good."}
{"text":"Why 5 stars?

Price to quality of the food ratio is excellent: Don't expect to die of food joy, but you will come away happy and your wallet will still have some money in it.

Service is uniformly both friendly and accurate, without being overly attentive and hovering.

The \"YEAH TEXAS\" theme is a bit much, but what can you expect with the name?

The only thing that I totally HATE about the restaurant is the country music. I've been told that it's corporate policy to pipe that stuff in. If you ask, however, they will turn it down to a more ignore-able level."}
{"text":"The food was good but everything else was awful. The server was rude and slow. She decided to pay attention to our table after I sent my beer back because there was a toothpick wrapper floating in it. They still charged me for the beer with the floating wrapper even after management said they would comp it. Needless to say I will never go back."}
{"text":"It should always be a bit of a red flag when it's a weekend night and there is no wait. There were only a few diners in the restaurant. We needed to eat quickly because we had to be home at a certain time. 
We were seated but it took some time for our server to come and take our drink order. It took awhile to get those. We aren't sure why since there was hardly anyone in the place. Our server brought us the mini loaf of bread but it was cold. 
We ordered our food and waited again. 
I ordered the Trio which came with a piece of sirloin steak, a BBQ Chicken Breast, and Grilled Shrimp. It came with a side salad. I asked for Blue Cheese dressing. It was very watery. 
I gave three stars because my entree was good. However there should never be long wait times when the restaurant is only 1/3 full."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance. Im not a country western fan but If you are going to have that theme you should stick with it and they did. The decor, music, menu etc. I ordered some type of steak, I think it was rib eye. It tasted like prepackaged cheap meat that they take out of the freezer and throw on the stove. The whole taste was weird. I actually got concerned I might get sick (i did not) from it being bad food so I just ate my spinach which was good. My man liked his chicken meal though. Very thin chicken breast with cheese on it. I for one will not go back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. The service on the other hand was horrible. I could get better service at The Applebee's that just shut down in chandler. I'm normally a 5 star giver. But the service was embarrassingly backwards"}
{"text":"Really like the food at Lone Star but this restaurant had by far the worst service and the food was not good. We waited over an hour for our meals. We finally requested our waiter check on our meal as 2 other tables that had been seated after us had finished their meals. About 5 minutes later he brought our food but is was cold. He never brought our water nor did he offer us refills on our beverages. Such a great disappointment."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time and service was ...eh....

Tonight we had Jennifer and she was awesome! I was having a bad day and she made jokes and made sure we always had drinks! Ask for her next time you come in because she made the experience awesome :)"}
{"text":"Food was good
Service was terrible 
At least there's no saw dust on the floor
Not inexpensive 
I wish I had the energy to put more but I honestly don't care about this place."}
{"text":"I was enticed to dine here originally because of the double miles awarded for using my Aadvantage Citi card. I mean if I'm going to eat I might as well get rewarded for it. Right?

I found the atmosphere to be pleasant and the service friendly but it did take a bit of time for the jalapeño pork chop to come out of the kitchen. In the mean time I was able to nibble on a loaf of soft, brown colored bread that that I can imagine was freshly baked that day. And I was okay with the wait since I was sitting at the bar, enjoying the Pirate (baseball) game and nursing a Sam Adams Lager.

I thought the beer selection could have been better but I suppose most people come here for a steak dinner over craft beer. 

When my pork chop, steamed broccoli and baked potato did arrive I thought, \"Well this was worth the wait\". The pork chop was thick and cooked to perfection. The broccoli was steamed just right and the baked potato came with plenty of butter (I requested lots of butter). The meal was delicious and better than I expected. I could see myself coming back... I mean, I get double rewards miles here!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and steaks. Their salads are homemade, the staff are wonderful and the managers are great. Sign up for the club!"}
{"text":"All too often, I become green-eyed over what my girlfriend Kay orders at restaurants. 

She'd been hankering for steak, so we stopped at this Lone Star franchise en route to Wal-Mart for a bi-weekly shopping trip. 

For the first 20 minutes of our Sunday lunch. we had the faux country/western joint to ourselves as songs of gunfights, cheatin' spouses, and poker games gone wrong played in the background. 

That Peppercorn Ribeye she ordered has a sauce or gravy on it that was savory to the point of being ambrosial. Her Peach Bread Pudding had a delectable French toast quality to it that would rival that of any hallowed, venerable diner throughout the Northeastern U.S. 

My 8 ounce filet mignon was no slouch, however, but it simply wasn't well-seasoned. Thankfully, the meat was of high enough, medium-rare quality that condiments were almost unnecessary. Nonetheless, I get the feeling that Omaha Steak Company was involved. A dry \"loaded\" baked potato certainly was and should have been arrested for disturbing the peace. 

Like Outback Steakouse, Lone Star has its own \"Bloomin' Onion\" that they call \"The Texas Rose.\" I have gathered that this too is frozen and shipped in. Far from inedible, I think the places that sell these should take a cue from a late, lamented menu item Outback once had and sever them into \"petals.\" Trying to eat this was awkward and required a knife, but the orange-colored dipping sauce was nicely reminiscent of Russian dressing and made the work almost worth it. 

The Chocolate Miracle Cake was my chosen dessert. Built 3 layers high, the wedge came with a raspberry sauce and vanilla bean ice cream. One bite had me thinking of Pepperidge Farms and thawed desserts. My only consolation came in knowing that a portion of the proceeds would be donated to the Children's Miracle Network Hospital. So, buy a mediocre dessert, and you help a sick kid. 

With over 150 restaurants, Lone Star's been slingin' out steaks since '89, makin' folks wonder if they're better off getting meat from their local butcher and grillin' 'em at home.

P.S. Apparently, from what I've read, most other Lone Stars have a decidedly \"urban\" theme. This West Mifflin location is one of the few remaining \"roadhouse style\" Lone Star restaurants. 

P.P.S. Quality service was provided by the adorable Tara."}
{"text":"No salmon there when I went. Call ahead to make sure.  They said \"it was a Texas bar.\"  Otherwise service was efficient."}
{"text":"We drove from Tempe for our anniversary, for a great steak ... without breaking the bank.  The website looked like the atmosphere was similar to Dave's Bar-B-Que, but the steak reviews were great.   I chose the \"Delmonico\" because it sounded the most flavorable.  It was the best steak I've EVER had.  Perfectly seasoned, char grilled to medium rare perfection, very tender and juicy.  Husband had a chicken breast layered with barbeque sauce, cheese and onion rings.  Equally delicious!  Our service was excellent and so was the wine.  A great price on Mondavi Cab and Chard.  They treated us to a complimentary desert.  We chose the peach bread pudding.  Outstanding!   We got exactly what we came for, great food with great service for a reasonable price.  Its not cozy and romantic, but the country vibe is fun!"}
{"text":"There steaks are excellent. As good as any high priced restaurant but in an inviting friendly atmosphere. They always cook my steak perfect and their seafood is great too. I have eaten there several times and plan to go back."}
{"text":"Well, it is a steakhouse, but since I don't really like steak and I had fish the last two nights, I decided on the bubba hamburger. However, what was served to me was the regular hamburger. When I pointed this out to the waitress, she asked if she could get some bacon on the side or some barbecue sauce for me. I opted to continue eating what they had brought me as long as I wasn't charged for the more expensive burger that I had actually ordered. The burger was actually very good, comparable to an Applebee's burger. 

I also opted for the garlic mashed potatoes rather than the steak fries, which was an awesome substitute. Hubby had the t-bone steak, and there certainly was a LOT of it!

We were hoping for the key lime pie for dessert, which was on their online menu but was informed by the waitress that they haven't had the pie for some time. Really? Perhaps someone needs to update the online menus."}
{"text":"I stopped up here with my girlfriend, our son, and another couple and their son on a Sunday at 5pm. We were surprised as there was not a lot of people parked in the lot, which gave me a bad feeling and boy was I correct. 

We walked in, got seated quickly and had the CAVS game on in our viewing area which was a plus since it was a big game. Now to the only good part of the night, the $2.99 margaritas. They were made pretty well and my girlfriend seemed to like them. 

Now to the BAD, which first goes to the service. Our server was not very interested in keeping up with our table at all which I found surprising as there was no one in the restaurant. He was more interested in watching the game then taking our order, even having the nerve to look at the TV screen while I was ordering. I did not receive a refill of my water the entire time as well as the other couple we were with did not receive their drink order until halfway through the meal, which he also got wrong. Our server also was sitting in a booth with what seemed to be a regular customer watching the game and sharing pictures on his phone while we waiting for our check. The manager was just standing around and never came to see our table; which was good because I would have told him how bad the service was. 

Next to the food. My girlfriend and I both ordered the bacon wrapped sirloin. It came with 2 sides each, with my girlfriend getting the garlic mashers and side salad, I went with the mac & cheese and garlic mashers. I do have to say when the food came out it was one of those moments where you look at your food and completely regret what you ordered. The meat was cooked to my liking (medium well) but was small and had no flavor, the bacon on the steak was all fat as well. The mac and cheese was watery, the salad was drowned in salad dressing and the garlic mashers were ordinary garlic mashers, nothing special. To put it honestly, I could have EASILY made a nicer dinner at home. 

Lastly, the place was DIRTY. The bathroom was filth pen and you could also see into the kitchen which had dirty water all over the floor that needed mopped up. 

This was the first and LAST time I plan on stepping foot in a Lone Star establishment. Literally, take your business anywhere else other than this dirty, less than mediocre food, and piss poor service place that thinks is a restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food!  Tonights service was exceptional!  Our table must have been bugged because everything we needed was at our table before we could ask for it.  Our waiter was so good with the two children at the table, asking them first for their order.  I dropped  the Ranch Dressing down my blouse and before I looked up there was a waitress there with a towel.  Very impressed with tonights food and service."}
{"text":"I have been to this place 2 times in the past few years when visiting AZ. And both times was amazing!!!

The service and the food is Amazing. The Texas Rose is super yummy! The Ribeye was cooked to perfection.

I wish there was a Lone Star in the California Bay Area!"}
{"text":"My friends like this place so I occasionally go to hang out. The food is never great and the service is iffy sometimes. Admittedly, we are a large group, but the service tonight went like this: (Pardon the fact that I am a meat eater.)

I ordered the steak sandwich and my friend ordered a Delmonico. The waitress brought us both Delmonicos and I said, \"I ordered the steak sandwich.\" She said, \"You said \"Delmonico.\" I said, \"No, I didn't,\" politely because it's not that big a deal. She refused to acknowledge that MAYBE she was wrong. Just insisted that I had said Delmonico. 

Is or is not the customer usually right, even if they are wrong, which I wasn't? I didn't make a big deal, just paid the difference and brought the rest home. But I don't recommend the place."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a Sunday night.  The place was not busy at all and no hostess at the podium.  Stood there for almost a minute, thought about leaving when someone finally came to bring me to a table.  The server was somewhat unenthusiastic but she did her job.  I ordered the Center Cut Top Sirloin, medium rare with a side salad and a baked potato.  Steak was cooked correctly, the salad and baked potato were good, too. Washed it down all down with a 22 ounce Yuengling. Overall, not a bad meal but nothing that made it stand out to any other steak house.  I'll chalk up the average service and odd atmosphere to it being a Sunday night.  I might go back on a different night just to see if anything improves but not any time soon."}
{"text":"Visited today at 5:30pm with ONLY one other customer in the restaurant.  The hostess said we just missed the crowd .... Ya, right!  
Ordered our drinks and had to wait 5 mins for our waitress to return.  Remember, there are ONLY 2 tables waited on.  We were served undercooked rolls.
Main entree was fair to taste and overpriced.  Had to wait to get refills on our drinks. Bar was empty and looked like it was about to be closed down.
Not sure if this place is about to close or they received a low sanitation grade but it sure looks like it will be shut down soon.  No management was there today ... strange."}
{"text":"Food was so so...the price was expensive compared to what we got. Waitress got our order wrong on a few things and td us how she has been up since 4am. Matter of fact she was telling everyone around us she was up since 4. It was because everyone had issues with the food and service. Will not be coming back!  :("}
{"text":"It was amazing. Our server was great I came in to get ribs. An ol how I love them. The whole business was doing well it wasn't loud and I didn't hear screaming kids! I'd recommend this to everyone! Also the manager joe is an amazing guy got a chance to talk with him. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Bad food bad brad bad salad, knife does not cut meat  it just sawed , never went to so bad STEAK HOUSE  in my life , please do a favor to your self run away as fast as you can!!"}
{"text":"We went there bcz we were starving and I had worked 22 hours that day and had to get my car from my job near the Biltmore...fun rush hour traffic...I was brain dead but that food perked me up let me tell ya.. The waitress was super nice, attentive brought out the drinks no issues...like clock work....The food was the bomb of course I had the baby back ribs and bakes potatoes...it was delish......yummy...scrumches sauce was perfect tangy and sweet and super soft meat...like butter melting in ya mouth"}
{"text":"I called Lone Star to order the spicy spinach dip and the Steak sandwich for takeout, along with a salad. I was told that my food would be ready in about 15 minutes. Since I live in the general vicinity, it took me about 15 minutes to drive there. I'm surprised to have never noticed them before and they're a fairly large restaurant kinda hard to miss, even in a mini mall. Parking, close to the restaurant, is somewhat limited but you do have plenty of mall parking spots to consider. My total came to $20 and change. 

The dip was quite spicy and cheesy spinach superb. The nacho chips were fresh and warm. I ordered my steak well done. It was perfectly cooked and tender. Since I ordered takeout (had to pickup at the bar), I added A1 sauce to my sandwich once I got home. The salad was good, and they put my requested salad dressing on the side, along with pickles, onions and tomatoes.

Overall, it was a nice meal and I'd go again, if just for the food."}
{"text":"The food was great and the waiter Patrick was very attentive. We were the last ones to leave on a Saturday night. My cell phone was left on the seat. After realizing while still in the car I called and there was no answer. The next day no one could find it. I strongly recommend not to bring anything of value to this restaurant, cause the employees will not turn it in to lost and found"}
{"text":"The New York Sirloin was cooked well, but it was pretty tough. The online menu said they had prime rib, which is why we came, but they don't even sell it. Our server Bryan was very good"}
{"text":"I got the fish and chips, with wedge lettuce and spinach as the sides. The spinach and wedge lettuce were fantastic. The lettuce was fresh, the ranch dressing very delicious (not overly tangy), and the spinach was so fresh and well cooked and flavorful for a steakhouse.  The fish was good, but the batter was slightly heavier than I like best. But not overly heavy like some places. The appetizer bread was super soft and flavorful with the butter.

Service was great.  The guy came back often to check on us.  

My friend didn't like her fish and chips as much as I did, but she's super finicky and hard to please so I do not fault Lone Star on that. Haha. 

A lot of people wanted booths, so we thought there would be a wait. But we didn't care and got a table immediately."}
{"text":"My expectations for this restaurant where not high. However, they failed to reach this even low bar.

Upon entering, the hostess greeted us and asked our name. Surprised she asked since the place was nearly empty she said that that was simply for the ticket. 

From behind us, the manager said \"that's how she flirts!\" The hostess was obviously made uncomfortable and we where not amused.

Our mustached waiter arrived, quickly and started to take our drink order. When one of us ordered a coke, he practically barked PEPSI. Not a question, not \"is Pepsi ok?\" The rest of the service was abrupt and without courtesy. I truly hope that this server has a alternate line of work that he is actually skilled at, because serving is not for him.  

Food arrived and was equally disappointing. Three overdone steaks and a burnt hamburger. We ate and left, given the unprofessionalism we experienced  on the way in there was no reason to expect the manager to deliver any resolution.

Chain restaurants are normally a safe bet while traveling. This is certainly one to avoid. The appalling food is only surpassed by the unprofessionalism of the staff. I am only glad I went with a group of men who could laugh off the sexual harassment and poor service."}
{"text":"Our family went for lunch on a Saturday to celebrate my husband's new job.  It was our first and last time going. The service and atmosphere was great but the food was really not at all and left all of us very disappointed.  The sirloin steak my husband got was okay but the salad he ordered came overdressed in ranch.....daughter ordered sidewinder chicken and fries and both were dry....my chili didn't taste great so I only ate two or three spoonfuls.....my baked potato was very dry.....babies got chicken tenders and fries that were too overcooked and too dry for them to eat.  Even my little boy said \"It's too hard.\"  Menu seemed overpriced for the quality of food we got.  I had high hopes and expected a lot from the restaurant and wanted it to be a really good experience for my husband and it wasn't for us."}
{"text":"I was a Lone Star Steakhouse virgin until last Saturday!

I dutifully checked out the menu online and made a decision immediately. Peppercorn crusted ribeye steak, twice baked potato and caesar salad. SUPERB!!! My steak was cooked exactly to my liking - well-done - and it WAS!!! YAY! It is very hard to get it cooked just the way I like it on the first try!!

Although I knew what I wanted, I was a little annoyed with the OVERLY attentive service at the beginning. My date & I just sat down and the server was there immediately to ask for our order. We politely asked for a few more minutes. She returned on the dot - three minutes after she left - asking, again, if we are ready to order. My date had not even looked at the menu, and we were in a pleasant conversation, when we were interrupted. 

We sent her away with our drink order. However, my date ordered the popular holiday libation - Christmas Ale - only to be told they were out of stock. Very surprising for a Saturday night!!! 

The restaurant was warm and Texas \"homey\", our booth was comfortable and roomy. There were a few young families who chose to sit at the bar with their young children - I thought that was odd. 

My date & I lingered over our food, devouring everything!! A cocktail server came to our table with a tray full if special \"chocolate pudding shots\" selling for $1 each. Proceeds go to the Children's Miracle Network. We were feeling very charitable, and we indulged!! They were too-die-for!! Who cares about calories & nutrition value, when you taste the nearly frozen chocolate pudding mixed with Baileys and Cool Whip served in tiny plastic cups.  Oh, it was heavenly!! 

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at Lone Star. I will definitely go again!! And, I walked away with a fabulous recipe for the most decadent, delicious pudding shots!!"}
{"text":"Great food and a rare bird of a honest manager when it comes to whats in the food. They have very comfy booths. Did nor care for the country music. I was able to blank out the music."}
