{"text":"Always a great experience when I come!! Bar tenders are the sweetest,Ashley mostly helped us:) always fun and chicken fingers and loaded nachos yum!"}
{"text":"Great bar food and then some.  Service is friendly and quick. Perfect stop to meet friends or associates."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday afternoon with the Mrs to catch a bit of the Tribe game. Haley was our server/bartender and did a good job. They have 6 drafts in tap, including one of the only Budweiser taps in Strongsville. They also have Keno and about 16 TVs, which could stand to be upgraded a bit.   We ordered the French Dip and a Local burger with saut√©ed shrooms, onions and Swiss. The burger came out on a toasted bun which was nice, and cooked perfectly, though a tad dry.   The French Dip was outstanding. They were out of tater tots, so we had fresh cut fries. These were a bit skinnier than usual, which made them perfect.   All the food was crazy hot.   Tab with 2 tall Lites and an ice tea was $29."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have gotten take out also. The food is good. It's you're standard bar food. I really enjoyed the wings and the burger is really, really good."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time about a week ago. Just looking for a local bar to hang out and grab some drinks. We were hanging out with friends and didn't want to go home yet.   Nice surprise. Seriously. We hit happy hour. Great prices and the bartender was very friendly and she was very fun. Ordered some drinks and relaxed.   It was nice because the bartender didn't hover and she came when we wanted more. She was good. We weren't going to eat but decided to get a basket tots. They were great! Crispy and soft inside. Huge basket for $2.99. Worth it!   We ordered more drinks and hung out for a few hours. Time went quick and we didn't realize it. All the food that came out looked good. But the tots were all we had.   I'd go back totally! Good find. Nice and clean. Good crowd. Friendly. Nice local bar! Ha!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! First to review and I'm not even a local-- well, not anymore!! LOL...   Came here today with some friends and family at the recommendation of my parents ( who ARE Strongsville Locals, and DO come here a bit)   Nice looking place, you walk in and are greeted front and center with a rather large bar- if sitting at the bar for a drink and eat is your style... or you can go to the right or to the far left of the bar and sit at tables if your looking to eat and drink in a group. They have high top tables, regular ones and some booths to boot. Reminded me of a nice and CLEAN sports bar. There are spikes hanging in unusual places and lots of sports gear... but it adds to the charm of it. There is a pool table to the back, and a bowling and golf machine for those fanatics... I personally am addicted to those games that sit on the counter tops at a bar, and they were calling my name tonight!!!   My parents yelled \" Pepperoni Crisps\" before I even opened the menu...so we ordered that, some beers ( happy hour again!!) and some munchies.   Everything was bar food and was quite tastey at that.   Dinner was a feast of gyro salad (mine), gyro sandwich( mom), BBQ Burger (friend), giant hot dog ( the kid :) ) and a Juicy Lucy Cheeseburger.  Hmmm, only thing that needs explaining is the Juicy Lucy Burger.. and I'll do the best I can. 1/4 burger with cheese or what ever on it, topped with a 1/4 burger and cooked... pretty much a stuffed burger! That was dad's... and he gave it a thumbs up.   6 of us ( one kid), all with rounds of beer (2), and all the above, not too bad... about $70-80... great, friendly service...."}
{"text":"Typical bar food, empty on a Saturday night, older lady bartender looked at my license and asked me  if I was 21.... Then threw my license back at me!? Should she know how to do the math? I wouldn't come here unless you are desperate."}
{"text":"Hot dogs are really delicious along with a huge order of cheese fries and add a milkshake after a great day at the lake."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time just because I was bored going to the same old places....didn't expect much - thought it'd be a seedy strip mall bar....but... The place is very clean, the service is ok (not great), the food is really top notch bar food.    Tried the French Dip sliders, thinking a lighter fare...3 good sized (about the size of a 1/5 lb burger) sandwiches, really GOOD home cut fries - all for about $7. My wife had the chicken wrap - they grilled it like a burrito - she loved it. Nice place, we've been back a couple times already....thumbs up"}
{"text":"This bar has great food!  We were there on Friday night and had their catfish special and clam chowder.  It was really tasty and well prepared.  The staff is very attentive.  The drinks and food were reasonably priced!  Like the vibe of the atmosphere, nicely decorated.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The perch is frozen. But so is the lake.  The fish was not special, ok stuff. The perigoes were standard fare.     Since they ran out of cod, I avoided disaster by ordering juicy Lucy black and blue!  A loaded burger is always good!   Fresh cut fries help to forget perigoes"}
{"text":"I came here with some friends and everything was great.  I would have giving 5 stars but they ran out of Yuengling and the Burgers that were on special."}
{"text":"Stopped here bc of Yelp reviews and it's right around the corner from the house.   I had the Wednesday burger and tots - it was very good. The tots were delicious!!  My husband had the BBQ Bacon Burger and fries he said it was fantastic. He likes his burgers rare - med rare and never gets it that way. He got it that way here!!   Service was quick and our waitress was nice.   I forgot the pictures - but we will be back!!"}
{"text":"If you're just going to Bilos for a drink at the bar, then this is a five star joint! It's quiet most nights and there are a bunch of bar games like pool, darts, keno, and some shuffle board thing.. Really a good time!!!!  However, they lose stars for their food. Ickkkk! I did not enjoy their food at all! Everything we ordered tasted like old oil..  Sooooo moral of the story? Have drinks and fun here but save dinner for elsewhere"}
{"text":"Great service and good food.  After a few visits one of the waitresses actually remembered what I usually order-  I like that type of service- her tip went up to 30% that day!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this location when it was Bilo's even I came to Cleveland for business. Haven't been sent here for a while so when I came back and it was something different I was skeptical. I'm no longer skeptical! Menu is an improvement. I had a delicious burger with tater tots. Price was beyond responsible. Pains seemed about the same and I love the 70's music. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for a drink with my friend. Everyone was super friendly and the owner even came up and shook my hand! The drinks were very reasonably priced and I was really impressed with how fast the bartenders made the drinks. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good bar/grille with a nice environment, friendly staff, and reasonably priced food/drinks."}
