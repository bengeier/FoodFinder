{"text":"Tasty food, generous and friendly staff, great price, clean.  Tried their fish today. Yummy! Will definitely go there again. Bravo  The place to go in Bloor west.  Tip: ask for extra garlic with their chicken sandwich. Makes it perfect."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Falafel World down the street, love 'em, BUT this new place Tasty Falafel is actually a bit better... a bit tastier, a bit better price, a bit more options/ingredients, and bit friendlier, a bit more generous, this place has really rocked my Bloor West world... deal breaker: Falafel World charges 50cents extra for a pinch of tabbouleh on a sandwich, Tasty Falafel generously applies tabbouleh for free and without hesitation... Tasty Falafel also has more overall options, gonna try their lamb next"}
{"text":"Didn't like it one bit. Had the chicken plate. I always finish my food but couldn't this time as it lacked flavour.  Probably the worst shawarma I've had. Great service though."}
{"text":"Yes this place is cheap, cheerful and delicious!!! Two for $4.99 full-sized falafel sandwiches!  Two for $7.99 full-sized chicken shawarma sandwiches!  The falafels are crunchy but super soft inside and the sandwich is chockfull of delicious tabulleh, hummus, pickles and hot peppers.  I even tried the dolmades and they are 3 for $1.25 and taste homemade.  Wow!  What a deal!  But what wins me over are the flavour and freshness.    I highly recommend this place.  Come and enjoy something truly cheap and cheerful!  A truly \"tasty\" experience."}
{"text":"I mean it's an OK place food wise. Sitting area is very dirty and unkempt.  Nothing special. I would rather takeout just because the ppace isn't clean. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"3.5*. Just ate here and it was pretty good. Very friendly staff who even checked in with me to see how I was enjoying everything. Unexpected nice touch at a shawarma place!   Decided to try something different with the fish pita (filet of sole) and it was really tasty. Large size is indeed large!   Only criticism is that the vegetables and add ons don't seem as fresh as I'm used to. Fish was tasty but the add-ons were not. I got a combo with tabbouleh salad which was definitely lacking in flavour. Seems they have the entrees down pat; would just like to see more from the accompanying dishes. I should be back to try more though!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place food is great and the owner and the other guy behind the counter are awesome and are great with the food and smiling and saying thank you but beware of the Asian (I think she Asian) lady is disgusting.. When I was there today and she was sitting down eating she comes to serve me (after licking her fingers) and doesn't wash her hands until I had to ask her to, when she puts the wrap together the pita is ripped and food is falling out in the grill and to her this is okay to sell and has an attitude when I said something... The food is always great but if the owner wants to keep his customers he'd get rid of this person and hire someone that cares about cleanliness and service as much as he does"}
{"text":"The food is great and the price is affordable. We had lamb shank And a fish. The servers were very friendly and food portions are decent. Their lamb shank is big and tender, i love it! The place is OK. It is not that inviting which is no wonder most people prefer to \"take-out\"  The owner was very nice, he gave me free a Turkish coffee. It is quite strong yet it tasted good"}
{"text":"Their falafel is a tasty treat, but be prepared for the hit sauce to overpower some of the flavor.  Next time I'll ask for half spicy, or with extra veg.    They have a deal every day that gets you two falafel for five bucks flat after tax.  They're not the biggest, but two will do you.  I wouldn't look to share.  At that price they're my go to in this area."}
{"text":"I wish people that had no idea about food would stop leaving Yelp Reviews. Tasty Falafel is mediocre at best. Their falafel was one of the weakest I've had in the city and everything else was just O.K."}
{"text":"I cheated on my go-to Bloor West place, Falafel World, and picked up dinner at Tasty Falafel on my way home.  I got 2 falafel sandwiches on whole wheat pita and there was an array of fixings including rice, chick pea salad, lentils, pickles, tabule, and tomato/cucumber salad. And the price - 2 falafels for $5 taxes in!  Bargoon!  The sandwiches were only slightly smaller in size than Falafel World but I found that they were much more flavourful and tasty on account of the extra fixings.    Service was quick and friendly.  I'll be by again for sure."}
{"text":"I got the fish sandwich, which was fresh and flavourful, pretty much 5 out of 5 I found the service to be above average Prices were fine Washrooms were fail"}
