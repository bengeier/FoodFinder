{"text":"Upon ordering you get a bunch of small plates! That was a nice touch. The pitcher we got was $20 and it was enough to be shared among 4 people in one glass. It was very watered down though.  I'd go again because of the atmosphere and ambiance, and cheap drinks"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but there was one problem.  12$ fries. Nuff said.  Who charges 12$ for a bowl of fries.."}
{"text":"i love going there, always welcoming! the food is really good and the beer cheap. Soju is quite expensive by itself so its better to take a combo. if you order a lot you can have free food or even free cocktails. The music is good (sometimes korean) and the waitresses are really nice and welcoming! definitely one of my best place to have a nice time and drink"}
{"text":"I came here for a group dinner after visiting the Christmas Market in the Distillery District recently. This place was recommended by a friend that frequent here. This place is a Korean bar. Our friend that frequent here did all the ordering of the food. He did all the ordering in Korean as this place is run by Korean people. The drinks that our friend order was really good - it was like a fruity cocktail. The flavors that we had was mango and peach. I really liked the peach one. Although, you need to be aware of how much you drink. As it is a fruity cocktail, I didn't realize how much I was drinking until I started getting the Asian Glow. The food that our friend order was delicious! My favorite dish that night out of all the food was a shrimp dish. The flavors was tangy and sweet. This is a nice place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I've searched over and over again, and I can't find any information on O Bar. I promise that's it's name, and I promise it's a real place.   What happens at O Bar is pretty magical, so I understand their desire to keep it under wraps. You buy their super cheap drinks, they bring you free snacks. It's like a cafe in Italy, only Korean and in Toronto. Order some bud bottles for $4 each? Spring rolls. Order their $50 mickey of Jack for the table? They bring you shrimp chips with ranch sauce (weird but good). Order another round of buds? Hello canned corn (weird and not good) and french fries (always good!)!   Big booths with wooden curtains, cheap drinks and free stuff. Koreatown. It's my happy place."}
