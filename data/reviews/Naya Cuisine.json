{"text":"This place is amasing. Honestly, the food is delicious, the service is fast, the owner is super friendly and she makes a to-die-for Halawa bi joubna (syrian style cheesecake). We tried their fatayer b lahma (meat pie), maroccan tajine, lamb kabeb, quail, shoukria and halawa bi joubna. and Everything was FANTASTIC. It may seem a little bit pricey but the quality of the food is worth it I think. And the meat is halal (for those who are interested in halal food)."}
{"text":"Our family really enjoyed our evening at Naya. The atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxing with the simple decor and the beautiful Arabic music in the background. We started with mint tea, vegetable grape leaves and fatoush salad, all very good. The grape leaves come on a bed of very fine hummus and a few olives. For entrees we chose the lamb Shakria, tender cubes of lamb in a delicately and deliciously spiced yoghurt sauce, and chicken Shaorma, which was very originally presented, delicious marinated chicken pieces with hummus and garlic sauce. The service was also very good. Overall, we had a very pleasant experience and we are looking forward to returning to try other dishes as well."}
{"text":"The reason I give this place 3 stars is for several reasons. While I do think the quality of their food is pretty good, the vegetarian menu is lacking in imagination. As a vegan I take great comfort in knowing there's a solid middle eastern restaurant right down the road, but it does get awfully monotonous ordering the same two dishes over and over again. The biggest complaint I have is about the hummus, it's so disappointing! Now it could be said that i'm a total hummus snob and am extremely picky, but the stuff they serve has a bizarre taste - my friend likened it to smoked meat. This is a huge turn off for me...i'd rather go to Aladdin's."}
{"text":"The lamb chops and caramelized onion mashed potatoes were terrific and I was pleasantly surprised that a salad was included with the entree. The seasonal vegetable side was green beans cooked like they had been in a can - cut small, flaccid, and anemic and not slightly crunchy and bold green as they really should have been. I wish they served wine because the mint tea was just that - I was hoping for mint tea a la Algerie - sugar, lemon, fresh mint leaves and served in a pot."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food in Pittsburgh. It is all home cooked. The sleek, spicy fish and grape leaves are the wonderful. Service is very friendly."}
{"text":"When it comes to appetizers, go big or go home--ordering the large mezza platter eliminates the need to decide which scrumptious salad, dip, olive platter, or delectable offering that you would be forced to eschew had you opted for a smaller size. And that means that if you pace yourself, you might just treat yourself to a midnight snack of the best smoky baba ganoush in the Burgh.  Chicken shawarma was nutty, flavorful, and contained just the right amount of sauce. The flavors stand for themselves, with sauce being a pleasant accompaniment--not overwhelming or masking inferior prep. Of the quality and variety one would expect for a signature dish in a middle eastern restaurant. It certainly did not disappoint.  My companion and I splurged and opted for dessert--flaky and sweet baklava along side steaming Syrian coffee. It's virtually the carbon copy of Turkish coffee, alas when dining in a Syrian restaurant...  This review is long overdue. As is my return trip to Naya. It's a culinary tasting tour of the Middle East in the sort of place perfectly suited for intimate dinner conversation. Charming, indeed."}
{"text":"The lamb chop is very tender and delicious. It is cooked with fruits so maybe a bit too sweet for people who don't like sweet taste, but for me it is very good. I also like the service, the decoration, and the atmosphere there."}
{"text":"This was a complete delight. The food was excellent, the service top notch. I am gluten free and casein free and they were able to accommodate my requirements completely. And frankly, this was the best hummus and baba ghannouge that I've eaten, ever. And the lamb was beautifully seasoned and tender. I will definitely return when I am in the Pittsburgh area. I only wish that I had taken a photograph of my dish as it was a lovely presentation."}
{"text":"Incredible food, absolutely loved it. I am syrian and honestly felt like I was eating at my grandma's home. Very hospitable and friendly owners. Definitely my new go to spot."}
{"text":"Some of the food was okay but definitely not worth the price they charged. I had the quail and it was over spiced and too greasy. I could count the number of ice burg lettuce pieces served in my \"side salad\" on my ten fingers (and I don't have to use all of them too)."}
{"text":"Naya is one of my \"comfort food\" places in Pittsburgh. Whenever I go there it feels like I have been invited to Radwa's (owner/main cook) dining room to eat a home cooked meal she has lovingly prepared. Quiet, reserved and so very hard-working, she clearly cares about offering quality food and experiences. Her vegetarian grape leaves are incomparable! I've had ok grape leaves at other restaurants before which left me compelled to crave and come get (sometimes on the same day) Naya's grape leaves. The  baba ganoush is perfectly balanced with flavor--only a hint of smokiness, not too sour, just enough salt and garlic."}
{"text":"Went back to Naya Saturday night and it was crazy packed and we got the last table! We were a group of 6 so we ordered the large mezze and extra grape leaves. Mezze is a must at Naya and it never disappoints.   I have chicken kabob with rice which was excellent, buttery, nutty, full of flavor and perfectly spiced. I believe three of us had the shawarma both beef and chicken. They had it with rice and fries and thought they equally great. One of my friend is vegetarian so she ordered fasolia- it becomes her new favorite at Naya. The husband had the lamb burger with fries. I had a bite and it is to die for!"}
{"text":"A great addition to the line up of ethnic places in Squirrel Hill.  Unique flavors and fresh ingredients.  We were pleasantly surprised at how much we liked this place.  The Mezza platter was excellent.  The restaurant could use more exciting pita bread or whole wheat pita.  The Molukhia was interesting with spiced greens over chicken.  The owner was willing to custom a dish for me and checked in with us after the meal."}
{"text":"The lamb chops are good but it is a little sweet as they are cooked with many fruits. The service is good there."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a great new addition to the Squirrel Hill restaurant scene.  My husband and I have been several times and have always been very pleased.  The food is very tasty and delicious, and the portions are quite large.  We have had the lamb burger, sleek, baba ghanouj and meshwi, and all of them have been great.  In fact, we have liked these dishes so much that we end up ordering the same few dishes when we make return trips and have not branched out to try other stuff on the menu, although I would like to eventually.  When we have taken guests from out of town here, they have always enjoyed it.  I really hope this place is around for a long while.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The flavors were delicious. The best Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh. The food is fresh and all foods were spiced perfectly. The falafel was crispy on the outside and the perfect texture on the inside. I had the kabobs for an entree. The side dishes perfectly complimented the meat with savory meat and sweeter rice. Even the side salad had the perfect dressing. I loved it! I will be back again. I dish and an appetizer was enough for two people."}
{"text":"Had dinner there this evening. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Hands down the best Baba Ghanoush you will find in the city. I'll look forward to making my way through the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I think this place offers the best middle eastern food i have ever tried in Greater Pittsburgh !!"}
{"text":"Best baba ganoujh we've ever had - creamy and smoky with oil. Sleek is usually fantastic - especially cold - with a hint of being lightly crispy breaded in cracked wheat served with lovely almonds and rice.  Great mojadra, and great Syrian spicy fish. The mint in the salad dressing and the feta, olives, etc. are also lovely. Good service, space, and location and always a table available. I order the baba and sleek regularly, and there's a little variability -- I'd say 3/4 times it's quite special and the other 1/4 times it's good but more comparable to other middle eastern places around. Good for take out too. I love Naya and hope it stays in Squirrel Hill for a long time."}
{"text":"Very pleasant dining experience last night.  The wait staff make you feel very welcome.  Comfortable room.  And the food is very good.  I ordered Chicken Shawarama and Falafel.  The Falafel is very good. Crispy on the outside and very light inside.  My wife had the Lamb Shank and Pilaf which was very flavorful.  Also BYOB which is a nice treat.  I recommend."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Naya to take 3 guests from California to dinner. I noted in the reservation that we had one person in a wheelchair. When we arrived we found that the entrance was not accessible (one large step up, and they didn't have a portable ramp). We asked to speak to the owner so that I could explain to her the ADA requirements and suggest the city's one-step program that provides financial assistance to install ramps to remove barriers. The server person said no one had ever complained previously, and the owner refused to come out to meet with us.  My friends from California were stunned, since such disregard for the ADA would never happen there. I explained how some of Pittsburgh  is still living in the '70s, and I am now working with the city and county to file complaints against the restaurant. Have never encountered such extreme disregard for accessibility and rudeness. The real insult was when the server told us \"thanks for coming by\" as we were leaving."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Middle Eastern food I've found in Pittsburgh. I've been to many similar places across the city but this is hands down the best. Luckily it's right around the corner from me, so I stop by every few weeks. My favorite dishes are the sleek and the mujaddarah. Their hummus is also fantastic. Every time I go in, I'm met with a friendly greeting and great service. I'm always surprised that it's not crazy busy, but I love that it has a nice low-key vibe compared to some of the other Middle Eastern options nearby. This place is great both for dine-in or takeout."}
{"text":"Naya is really cute and in a convenient location. The atmosphere is welcoming but not overdone, and I enjoy the ambiance. You can't really see in from the outside because the glass is dark, but once you step inside it has a nice vibe. And the food is really good! I love the sleek plate, I don't know how they do it but it's so flavorful and has the best texture! I really appreciate the unique flavors that Naya brings to the squirrel hill neighborhood!"}
{"text":"The owner and waiter were very friendly and the food was extremely tasty. The spicy Syrian fish was especially good as was the cardamom ice cream."}
{"text":"It'd be easy to get lost among all the restaurants in Squirrel Hill, but my wife and I are really glad we gave Naya's a try.  The first time we went, we ordered 3 appetizers: the mezza platter(its a sampler), keftades, and falafel.  The second time back we couldn't help but do the same thing with the addition of the moshkan.    Finally, for our third visit, we ventured into the entrees and weren't disappointed.  My wife order the Moroccan shrimp and I ordered a shrimp pasta.  Her's wasn't necessarily what she would think of as authentic Moroccan but it was delicious, and mine was solid as well, although a little on the heavy side.   It's BYOB with a small fee.  Squirrel Hill is overpopulated with Asian restaurants so I'm so happy that we've discovered this blend of Syrian/Eqyptian/Middle Eastern place."}
{"text":"Exquisite cuisine and an added unique slant on popular middle eastern dishes. For starters we sampled the Mezza platter, and for my entree was the Lamb Chops Tamer was the perfect compliment to our pinot noir we brought in. For dessert we were served baklava with delicious vanilla ice cream. Bring your friends and family or impress your date in the ambient atmosphere Naya has to offer."}
{"text":"Ordered take out when entertaining a guest with gluten sensitivity, and was not disappointed!  The Syrian Spicy Fish was tilapia expertly prepared and so flavorful.  It had a nice bit of heat and sweetness topped with walnuts and served with sweet almond rice.  My husband is not to keen on sweet and savory, but he loved the lamb shank with a delicate balance of sweetness infused.  The tandoori chicken was also nothing to scoff at.  And the hummus was delightful.  We can't wait to eat this again, and our next visit will be eat in.  The small dining room is warm and modern, a great place for a quiet date or catching up with an old friend."}
{"text":"I came here some time ago but recall the food and experience were excellent. The Danwood Basha was delicious as was the Tabouli Salad. The House Lentil Soup was also very good. For dessert I had the Namoura, which was excellent and not overly sweet as I had initially feared. Service was excellent as our server was very friendly and accommodating. This was overall a very nice experience and most certainly one I'd like to have again soon."}
{"text":"My favorite Resturant in Pittsburgh !!    I like their Kebbie, shawarma , and sure Lamb Burger. I also like one of their appetizers which is Musakhin? \" fried rolls of chicken\" it's really good and I only find it there. Their rice is really special too  The owner and staff working their are nice ppl.  Highly recommended place"}
{"text":"I'm really happy this restaurant opened up in Squirrel Hill. We had the sleek plate and the falafel sandwich. The sleek was one of the best things I've ever eaten, tart and nicely spiced, with a delicious rice pilaf on the side. The falafel was very good as well, served in an oversized pita with pickled vegetables and tahini. We are excited to return and try more dishes."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had and I tried the lamb burger.  The sauce is what made it amazing. Owned by a Syrian lady who was really nice."}
{"text":"I'm here for work from Houston and was looking for some delicious middle eastern food. found it! I came mid-afternoon and enjoyed being the only person seated, although several people came and went for take out.   One of these people suggested the baba ghanoush - apparently it's quite good. I opted for several dishes so I could have leftovers :-). I got the massi"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken shawarma! Great grape leaves, friendly service. Delicious hummus, heavy on the tahini, which is how I like it! Really great experience over all."}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant! I'd been there once previously and enjoyed the food. My family was coming into town and wanted to have dinner with me and my friends. I sent them a few menu options and my dad wanted to try Naya since they'd never had Syrian food before. As a party of 8 people, Naya happily obliged us. Then, that day when it turned out my family were running late due to NYC traffic and we needed to move our reservation back an hour to 8pm, I called Naya to ask. Turns out, they close at 8pm on Sundays, but they said they'd stay open for us. Our server was so friendly and nice. And our food was fantastic.  We had a Mezza Platter, a spinach pie, and two orders of the Sambousek (one of my favorites) as appetizers. There was nothing left at the end. All were delicious. The hummus is great and creamy and the baba ganoush has that smokey flavor you are looking for with the dish. I am not a fan of olives, so I didn't eat those, but my dad ate them right up! The Sambousek has mint in it, which I love, but it surprises some, so know there's mint.   I'd say the majority of the people in the party got shawarma's of some kind. All really enjoyed their meals. As a vegetarian, I veered left and got the Fasolia which was delicious. The green beans are fresh and bright and the onion and tomato sauce is just the right mix of tart and sweet. I had leftovers and they were just as good the next day.   Our bill was so reasonable for all the food we'd eaten and I left a generous tip given that they stayed open extra hours specifically to serve us. Our server came over and asked if I meant to leave the tip I did, saying she felt it was too much. I appreciated her concern, but of course it wasn't too much! She'd been fantastic and attentive the entire time, she and the others there  stayed open two hours later than they would have, and Naya provided a great experience.  This is a great place with fantastic food, wonderful service, and I will make sure to go there as often as I can."}
{"text":"A weak 3 star . The restaurant is nicely organized with a fair amount of space between tables. It was quite empty when we were there on a Wednesday. Service was fine.  The baba ghanouj was good -  a generous serving for the appetizer - that should please Pittsburghers. The entrees were disappointing. The lamb shank was too salty, although the fruits added a nice sweet flavor. The shawarma was chewy, and not particularly good.   And it's not cheap at all: entrees are around 18-20 (sandwiches are cheaper, and may be better)."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The staff are always very friendly and helpful and the food is amazing. Love the baba ganoush , has a delicious smoky flavor to it; my not too adventurous husband loves it and he is not an eggplant fan. The falafel, hummus are equally delicious as well. I'm not a lamb eater so I can't render an opinion on it. Not adventurous husband enjoys the shrimp and the steak kabobs.  I highly recommended you visit this restaurant; you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very good food, the actual place looks two star but the food is four or five.  Only issue I had was I ordered porta bells stuffed mushrooms and got deep fried reg mushrooms. I ate it anyhow.   Very good service, warm friendly servers. And very good food. I had the hamburger with the middle eastern twist as well. Very good!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't know it by looking at me but I am actually Lebanese and Syrian. My Grandfather used to make middle eastern food, so I know a little bit about it. Let me tell you....this is the most authentic middle eastern food that you'll find in the Pittsburgh area.  The food was great, service was great, atmosphere was great, and the location is very easy to get to. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for REAL authentic middle eastern food."}
{"text":"The Lamb Tamer was outstanding,  as well as the Lamb Kabob,  meat grape leaves and tabuli.  Everything  arrived  perfectly done and delicious.  The wait staff couldn't have been better. Can't wait to come back. NAYA Is very gluten free friendly."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up! Baba was awesome, beef shwarma amazing, Syrian coffee was a great finish...service was great, highly recommend checking this place out!!"}
{"text":"I feel very lucky that this restaurant has opened recently near my workplace! I had some Greek lamb balls and hummus for a pick-up yesterday, and I went for a complete lunch experience today. The meatballs were very delicious and the tomato sauce they came in was full of flavor and just the right texture! The hummus was one of the best hummus I've had in the US! Today for lunch, We ordered portabella strips and hummus as starters, and lamb burger and  fattoush as entrees. The lamb burger was very yummy and didn't feel too heavy like most burgers are! The fattoush tasted very authentic (I'm Middle Eastern) and was a huge portion so was definitely worth the $7. The cook Radwa came out and greeted us and asked us if we liked the food which was very nice! The server was friendly and attentive but I didn't get the feeling he was very knowledgeable about Middle Eastern cuisine. The general atmosphere, the décor, and the music selection were satisfying! I am definitely coming back to this place to try more items from both the lunch and dinner menu."}
{"text":"I am in heaven, or maybe it's just Naya. This restaurant is the best place for Mediterranean food in Pittsburgh. The Syrian chef makes Sleek and it is a plateful of awesome. Best humus and babganoush I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Naya twice with a couple large groups of friends and enjoyed (most of) my experience both times. The actual restaurant has always been relatively quiet - so it's the perfect place to meet and talk with people - and I like the decor and set-up of the place. It's small but comfortable, decently lit and well arranged.   I definitely like the food here, too - I've had their shawarma, which is fantastic, and their falafel sandwich. This was tasty enough but I did think there was too much falafel and not enough dressing, lettuce and other items to balance out the falafel. I just like an equal balance of toppings in my sandwiches. The french fries they serve are fine as well - there's no special seasoning or anything on them but they're tasty enough.  Where my friends and I tend to run into problems is with the service. The first time we visited, the server rarely checked on our table and so we often sat without water for long periods of time. Our food did not all come out at once and a lot of people waited five to ten extra minutes for things to be wrapped up in the kitchen. Fortunately during our last visit we didn't have this problem at all, although now that they've adjusted prices on the menu some people had some problems getting the right receipt for their orders. (I personally can't comment on this last bit but someone mentioned that bathrooms smelled horrible during one of our meals here. I'm kind of afraid to use the restroom here now.)  With all of this in mind I think this place is a solid \"a-ok\" - there's lots of good things here to appreciate even if there's been a couple hiccups during my last few visits here. I'll definitely keep them in mind for group outings since they provide a great atmosphere and a quiet meeting place - quite the rarity among restaurants these days!"}
{"text":"Great food! Wonderful service --  Fadi is so sweet. Great baklava. Chicken shawarma is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I just went to Naya's for the second time and had a really memorable meal. We started with the baba ghanoush and hummous and they were delicious. Creamy and a great texture and not too oily. We also had the meatball appetizer, which may have been the best meatballs I've ever had - the tomato sauce was thick and well spiced and the meatballs were moist and flavorful. They were really large and could easily have been an entree with a side salad.   For my entree, I had the lamb chops. They come with a sweet sauce of dates and apricots, which I liked because it was really with the mashed potatoes. In the future though, I may ask for it on the side because for the two chops that had less sauce, I got to taste the grill flavor and that was incredible! The lamb was grilled perfectly. There are great little touches too like the little pieces of grilled (or fried?) onion on top of the mashed potatoes.   For dessert, we had Syrian coffee and chai tea and shared namora (the best I've ever had - crisp out the edges and moist inside and very aromatic with the rose-water honey). The slivered almonds on top were really good. I've been to several middle eastern restaurants in Pittsburgh and this is my favorite. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a wonderful celebration at Naya. They accommodated our larger than expected party at the last minute and handled our multiple credit cards and cash with grace. The food was delicious, and the BYOB feature added to our meal. We shared scrumptious plates of baba ghanoush and I had the Syrian meatballs in tomato and pomegranate sauce, highly recommended. Thank you Naya for a great time!"}
{"text":"Decent food...along the lines of Aladdin's in flavor but more expensive. I ordered the chicken shawarma with hummus and I'll say it was a very big portion, as was the fattoush. Nice service and clean environment."}
{"text":"Four of us had reservations on a recent Saturday and were looking forward to great food as we had experienced just two weeks previously.  As before, the food did not disappoint.  Overall probably the best chicken and lamb I've ever had at a Middle Eastern restaurant.  The service is another story.  The place was busy and understaffed but we knew that from before and given the quality of the food we all felt it was worth the wait. Couples and groups were being tuned away unless they wanted to wait.  One such group of four decided to wait.  After no more than an hour and ten minutes we had just finished our entrees and were anticipating the desserts when we were presented with the check.  When the server was told we were interested in dessert and coffee, we were told we could have it but it will be a long wait before they would have time to \"make it\".  It was clear the server's intention was for us who had a reservation to leave in order to open up the table for the group that did not.  We complied but it was a rather discourteous ending to an otherwise good dining experience.  Beware, the servers although for the most part friendly are young, disorganized and inefficient.  If you want to go, go early when they are not so busy and pressured.  If we are just talking about the food I would give it four stars.  The service takes it down to a two."}
{"text":"This Syrian cuisine is great and flavorful. Except the lentil soup was a bit bland. We had a pleasant experience--seated quickly, treated kindly, and food was fresh. My only complaint would be price tag...I feel like it's a bit overpriced for what you get. The menu has some unique dishes that differ from your typical middle eastern restaurant's wraps/rice and kabobs."}
{"text":"I went for lunch after reading reviews on Yelp.  I'm always looking for new restaurants to try.  I don't mind eating by myself.  When I walked in there were two gentlemen there.  I found a table and sat down.  My waiter Tom introduced himself and stated to not be too hard on him because it was his first day.  He told me he has sampled some items and all were delicious.  I took a look at the menu and ordered a glass of water.  Everything sounds delicious when you're hungry.  Finally I decided to go with Salmon Nappi when was cooked in a bread and came with mixed vegetables and couscous.  It was incredible.  Salmon cooked to perfection.  I would of never thought to wrap it in a breading.  I cannot recall the name of the bread but it had the texture of baklava.  The portion correlated with the price.  During my meal,  a woman came up to me asking how my meal was.  I told her everything was delicious.  She asked if it was my first time and I responded yes.  She replied how did you hear about us?  And I told her Yelp.  She told me that she hopes to see me again.  Needless to say I'll be back!  Maybe next time I'll have someone to accompany me to be blown away!"}
{"text":"Because my family is from the region, I am generally a tough judge of middle eastern restaurants. Naya is better than most of its kind in Pittsburgh. The food is clean and delicious (I've sampled mostly vegetarian items). The service was very friendly and attentive. This is a family owned business, everything made from scratch. The babaganoush and homemade baklava were delicious. Decor is simple yet inviting. Kid friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great authentic home cooked Syrian food! I highly recommend it! Everything we had was delicious! Plus, they are super kid friendly."}
{"text":"I give this two stars due to portion and price. For 14$ you get some chicken, two slices of cucumber, two slices of tomatoes, a few slivers of onions. The food itself is solid, but for 14$ it's ridiculous. A similar type place will give you chicken, salad, hummus, pita, full side of vegetables for 10$ usually."}
{"text":"The baba ghanoush is so amazing, it's reason enough to come here! I think next time I may make an entire dinner of it, maybe with some hummus on the side.  Everything else I've had here has been delicious as well. The service is friendly and fast, and it's not usually busy for dinner (surprisingly), so it's a quick easy place to eat. Give it a try - it's way better than the other restaurants of the same genre in Squirrel Hill and Oakland I've been to. The only drawback is how eerily quiet it's been a few times I've been here."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the meal at Naya.  The restaurant was a bit short staffed, just 1 server and there were several 2 person parties, a 6 person party and a 12 person party, so service was a bit slower than I would have liked.  I started with an order of tabbouli, which on a scale from 1-10 was probably 6.5, it was very fresh, but not the best that I've had.  For my entree, I ordered the Sleek, which is a combination of kale, bulghur and black-eyed peas, this was pretty decent.  It's rare to find Sleek on a restaurant menu, so this was a nice surprise, but doesn't compare to Madonna's version in downtown Pittsburgh and I also ordered the meat pie which was probably the best meat pie that I've ever had.  The dough was more of a yeast dough than a flaky pie dough and the meat inside was perfectly seasoned, but probably could have used some chopped tomatoes.  All-in-all this was a good meal and I would definitely return.  The price was right and the food was tasty."}
{"text":"My friends and I wanted to try something new in Squirrel Hill, so we decided to have lunch at Naya. I was pleasantly surprised! It's a simple and fairly small place, but there weren't many people there, so it felt quite spacious. The manager (or owner?) was our server because she said the server didn't show up, so it sounds like they have some issues with the staff, but it didn't affect the service we got. At any rate, she gave us some good recommendations.  We got the Dawood Basha (Syrian meatballs with gravy), Sleek (kale dish), and Chicken Shawarma. The dishes also came with rice pilaf that was sprinkled with almond slivers. I thought all the food was delicious. It tasted homemade and the meal was reasonably priced. I usually give a place five stars if I start drooling thinking about the meal. I plan to go back again some time!"}
{"text":"Flavorful food, excellent (and friendly service)! One of my favorite middle eastern spots in the city"}
{"text":"Love their burgers! Like OH MY GOD! So juicy and yummy and delicious and everything! It( the burgers) sure has a touch of middle eastern in it which I don't care about. Every time I bite into those burgers the juice from the patty keeps dripping aahhh god it's lush! Try the lamb burger! It's tummyliciously good!"}
{"text":"Naya is ok. I was in the mood to try a new restaurant I hadn't eaten at before and after driving by I figured I would give Naya a try.  Their food was ok. Nothing special. It's a cute little restaurant, our waitress was very good but nothing special about the food.  We started with the hummus appetizer which was delicious. Then I ordered the falafel wrap. The wrap came out so packed that it was practically impossible to hold it together without everything falling out. The wrap itself was very thin and did not hold together very well. The falafels were ok.  Not sure that I would be back to eat at Naya. I think there are better Mediterranean restaurant selections around town."}
{"text":"Exaland food and service. We had our dinner there few times the falafel is the best in pittsburgh the food prepared on the spot  do all are fresh and tasty and the service is outstanding. Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This is a middle of the road review for me. My most recent visit was with some girlfriends.  We did the BYOB thing and brought two bottles of white wine.  Love BYOB - 5 stars for that.  The server was friendly and brought wine glasses, but nothing to keep the wine cold, which was a bit of a bummer.   We started with a few appetizers - a mezze platter and some cheese filled fried thing.  The apps were easily the best things we ate - I would order both again.   The entrees seemed a bit lackluster in comparison.  I ordered a yogurt based beef dish with rice.  The yogurt sauce was under seasoned and texturally unappealing, but the beef was good.  The main problem was that there wasn't enough of it.  Just a few chunks in a vat of sauce.     The other thing that annoyed me just a bit was that he split the appetizers among everyone's tab.  Don't get me wrong - I love that the ability to split something 6 ways is an option.  It should be an option though.  I ordered one app and a friend ordered another.  We each intended to pay for these items ourselves.   We did all sample, but I felt bad that the others automatically had to pay for something they didn't order.   Great that they can do it, but he should have asked how we wanted it.  Also, the menu states that they only take up to 4 (I think) credit cards per table.  I have worked in a restaurant and get that running cards takes up precious time, but suck it up buttercup, cause that is how people pay."}
{"text":"Lovely independently-owned restaurant with absolutely delicious mediterranean food. So fresh and fantastically seasoned! Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Service was terrible.   Took nearly 10 mins for them to bring out our drinks. 25 mins for our appetizer to come. 45 mins for our salads. We had to ask for utensils and napkins. Our main course didn't come our for over an hour and they got my order wrong. They never refilled our water...we always had to ask them to.   They didn't even begin to apologize until we expressed that we were displeased with the service. A nice lady from the kitchen did come out to apologize and gave us free dessert. However, free dessert does not excuse awful service.   Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Can I express how excited I am that Naya Cuisine has opened in Squirrel Hill? No! If you're looking for authentic middle eastern cuisine in Pittsburgh, Naya is a must. I personally love their baba ganouj! The atmosphere is very inviting inside and it's located in the heart of Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Naya on OpenTable. Upon arrival at the restaurant, a waitress asked me if I wanted a table for two people. I mentioned that I had a reservation so that I would receive my OpenTable points. The waitress told us that my husband and I could sit anywhere. The restaurant looked very casual, so my husband commented to me that I was funny to make a reservation for the place. For my appetizer I ordered the Moskhan, which are crispy chicken dumplings. They tasted good but were slightly burned. I overhead a waiter telling a neighboring table that their appetizer was burned and that a new one was being made for them. Our Naya Salads looked plain with only one piece of cheese and one olive. The dressing tasted interesting. For our entrees, the waitress seemed unsure about which sides we could get. She said that we could get only rice pilaf or cous cous, although mashed potatoes, fries, and hummus were mentioned on the menu. I mentioned cous cous but then inquired about the hummus, and she replied that I could get it. My husband ordered lamb, which was a little dry, and I ordered beef schwarma, which had a nice sauce. Neither of us enjoyed his rice pilaf, but my cous cous was moist and fluffy. The waitress came over once to ask us if we needed anything, and she left without filling my husband's empty glass. I waved over another waiter, and he quickly gave us drink refills. At the end of the meal, when we received the check, we saw that the tiny side of hummus was not for free and was very expensive for the size. My husband did not enjoy his food, and he left a lot of food on his plate and said that we will not return. I did enjoy my food. My OpenTable points did not show up soon on the website. I was afraid that I would have to provide evidence to OpenTable that I had dined there, but my points did show up eventually."}
{"text":"My (now ex-) boyfriend and I went to Naya back in Feb.  I suggested it, and between the positive reviews on Yelp and the fact that he'd been there and recommended it, I was excited to try a more upscale alternative to Aladdin's and Ali Baba.  I ordered the molukhia (a dish containing shredded chicken and leafy vegetables), which the waitress recommended as one of her favorite dishes.  When it came out, I saw something that looked suspiciously like a hair in it, and by George, it turned out to be...exactly that.  The waitress saw me pulling it out of the dish, and came over to ask if everything was okay.  I showed her it, and she asked me if I'd like a replacement of my dish.  Wishing to be gracious, I declined.  After a few minutes, the owner came over to ask how things were.  Without my saying anything, she said the waitress had told her I'd found a hair in my food, and apologized.  She then proceeded to explain that this was a problem with the meat provided by her supplier, rather than on the restaurant's end, and offered to comp me with the baklava.  While I felt that the waitress handled the situation appropriately, the owner's (non-) apology and so-called remediation was anything but.  If what she said is true, then (1) this means other customers have had the similar unpleasant experience of having food containing hair served to them and (2) why doesn't she change her supplier?  Regarding my experience, given that I refused a replacement dish, I feel that the proper recourse would have been to comp the dish for me.  Comping me with a $2 dessert was, quite frankly, insulting.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful ! Went there on a Friday night for dinner and we were quickly seated by the friendly waitress. We had the chicken shawarma and chicken kabobs. Really well cooked , tasty and flavorful chicken. We added the couscous on the side , and omg it was so flavorful.  For dessert we ordered the baklawa and namoura, and it's hard for me to say which one was better than the other. Must visit middle eastern place , will go there again !"}
{"text":"My daughter has been wanting to try this place for some time now.  I didn't know much about it so I came here without any prior knowledge of  previous reviews, menu options etc. Upon entering the restaurant, I was promptly greeted by the owner and I found the surroundings to be very pleasant, clean and relaxing. We were very impressed with the menu and ordered a few starters until we were able to decide on our dinner selection.  The food could not have been any fresher or flavorful.  We both left feeling well nourished but without the feeling of being overly stuffed!  We felt very welcomed by the owner and our server. Great food presentation as well."}
{"text":"I almost didn't try Naya's food while visiting Pittsburgh.  When my cousin, Judy, told me about it, my first thought was that I've eaten plenty in Houston.  What got me to finally try was the look on my cousin's face every time she mentioned Naya's food.  What's wonderful about Naya's Restaurant is that there is a variety of items on her menu.  It satisfies meat eaters and vege eaters alike.  I tried the baba ganoujh, vege grape leaves, mojadra, rice pilaf with almonds, and a side salad with special mix dressing.  My husband ordered the lamb and shared everything else with me.  We could not stop eating!  It was love at first bite.  We tried to go back on her last day in Pittsburgh, but the restaurant was closed for the holiday.  Naya's is a MUST TRY.    Randie Lin, food blogger @ https://myfoodfreedom.wordpress.com"}
{"text":"Both spacious and cozy, the food here is delicious and clearly made with great care. I had chicken shawarma, lamb kebabs, and Halawa bi joben,  which is a Syrian style of cheesecake. I would gladly order it all again, but then I'd be denying myself the opportunity to explore all the other delicious items on the menu.  We shared baba ghanouj and my friend had the familia, a wonderful green bean dish.  This place is great if you're a meat eater, a pescetarian, or a vegetarian. For us I'm divorced, it was a little like Heaven.  Go hungry. Gets lots of stuff. Share."}
{"text":"Naya is delish!!! I've been here twice and can't say enough great things.  The owner is welcoming, kind and makes great menu suggestions.  This time, my friend and shared the mezza platter with hoummus, tabbouleh and grape leaves.  For my meal, I had the spicy snapper with rice and almonds.  My husband is from the Middle East, so I know home cooked middle eastern food... and Naya is that good!!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place with the family to celebrate my college graduation, and I had made reservations the week before with OpenTable. I requested that they call me the Friday before we came (on Sunday), and they did not disappoint!   Decent place with a pretty rustic, yet vaguely exotic feel. Decor felt like it was Pottery Barn or Bombay Company (anyone remember them?) inspired, and even though my family and I dressed up, others wore casual clothes. Calm place, only two other tables. The waiter was friendly and helpful, catered to every need, though I believe he forgot some stuff a couple times. Nothing major.   Halal alert! All the meat is halal, which is awesome cuz my grandmother only eats halal meat. My parents had ordered some babaganoush, hummus, and grape leaves. Standard pan-Middle Eastern/Mediterranean fare, although I believe the owner is Syrian. I found the hummus and grape leaves to be decent, and my father, who loves babaganoush, found that to be excellent. I'm not a fan of babaganoush in general, so I didn't enjoy it, but it was well received by the other members of the table.   I ordered the beef kibbeh with couscous, which was one of the choices of sides. It also came with a salad, which was mostly iceberg lettuce, olives and a bell pepper. The kibbeh itself was a bit salty, but since it's a fried ground beef dish mixed with a grain (the same as couscous, perhaps), that's exactly the way it should be. It was delicious and presented in a compact rectangle while the couscous was a hemisphere. That made it look like far less food than there actually was-I couldn't finish either. Definitely worth your while if you like middle Eastern/Mediterranean!"}
{"text":"Never judge a book by it s cover... Simple decor but food full of flavour.  What a gem.  This was our first time here.  I order the lamb kabob dinner.  The rice with almonds on top was delicious; the lamb skewers, really good.  My dinner date had a meat dish in a yogurt and onion sauce.  Almost like a beef stew but a white stew (yogurt sauce)... I have to recommend this dish to anyone who goes to Naya s... The sauce was divine!  It s a byob place, so bring your favourite bottle of wine and get ready to taste the flavours.of.the middle east.  Oh and the owner was the sweetest.  She approached every table.to.ask how their dinner was.  I ll be back!"}
{"text":"We walked in to an empty restaurant. So our expectations were very low. But it was still a Tuesday night. The setting is pretty. It's got only four seater tables with a flower in middle. They got us our drinks immediately after and then took out order. The menu isn't very big but it's very well explained. The waitress was very sweet told us not to get the kus kus. I think it was a pretty good idea. We got the fitur2 and the chicken shawarma. They were both Incredibly delicious. I got the fries with my shawarma. The best fries in the fucking United States of America is found at a mid eastern restaurant.  Will go there again and again and again"}
{"text":"Flavors were outstanding,  and interesting.  We eat Middle Eastern cuisine often and like to try new types.  Natalie impressed us and our kids were fans too (ages 8 and 5). Our daughter loved the lentil soup so much she asked her brother if she could finish his.  He loved the lamb and we all loved the falafel,  which was extremely light and flavorful. The Fatoush salad was full of fresh herbs."}
{"text":"I called these guys with a last minute catering order and they were really polite, on their game, and the food was Awesome. Big thumbs up from everyone in our group, highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is where we wound up one of the nights we could not take the wait at one of the local pizza joints.  We are sure glad we walked up the hill!  Naya does not look like much outside and doesn't really explain the delights you will find inside.  We started with the full mezza platter.  Middle eastern appetizers, dips, and spreads are always a hit, but Naya's were not the standard, they were of excellent quality.  We enjoyed the hummus, baba ghanouj, za'atar, feta, olives, tabbouleh, etc.  Scrumptious.  We got two vegetarian entrees, that were also blissful.  One was shredded kale with bulgure and black-eyed peas that was cheap (we called it the Middle Eastern take on rice & beans) and delicious.  We also got the mixed veggies, which had okra, bell pepper, green beans, and lots more in a delicious sauce.  We were thrilled to have leftovers, which made an excellent breakfast the nice day.  It was wonderful to have so many vegetables in our meal."}
{"text":"Family-owned small business with excellent service and good food. Everyone's kebab was cooked to order and very tasty; the rice with almonds was also very good. Sampler mezze platter was good to share amongst 5 people. Grandma also came by to say hello since we asked who made the great baklava.  BYOB and there are 2 liquor stores within a block."}
{"text":"Best falafel I've had in Pittsburgh.  Right on Murray Ave near Jerry's records and Dobra tea. Very friendly wait staff that seem to be getting better and faster.  Check out their YELP checkin special for a free soda."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what you actually get!  I ordered the lamb salad- $16.. For a small salad with 4 pieces of lamb- not all that well seasoned. The tzatziki had no flavor to it, nor the hummus-    My man had the lamb burger - which was also very bland.... But The service was good and the place looks very nice  Not many affordable options for gluten free eater like myself!   Too expensive for food that doesn't match the price tag."}
{"text":"I stopped in here at 11:30am on a weekday to grab some take-out lunch.  The ambiance of the place is sleek and clean with art and curtains that give it a slight middle eastern flair.  It was completely empty when I arrived, but perhaps it was simply too early for the lunch rush.  I ordered the baba ghanouj and a falafel wrap, both $6.  The baba came with TONS of pita bread -- a whole generous bag full of it!  I definitely only used up half of the pita bread for the dip.  I feel like $6 is not cheap for a dip, but the portion you get plus the amount of pita that comes with it makes it an okay deal (plus, it was pretty tasty).  The falafel nuggets in the wrap were quite yummy, nicely spiced with good balance in flavor.  They were soft (not crispy) but not soggy.  I did, however, specify that I didn't want a pickle in my wrap and they included one anyway.  The wrap is also a generous portion and comes with a side of fries.  The fries were utterly forgettable, and because the portions of everything else were so big, I didn't even eat them.  Overall, though, even if the falafel sandwich didn't come with fries at all, it's still a pretty good deal for the price.  The lady working the desk was super nice.  And, in general, I liked the food here.  I just wasn't WOWed by it, and while it's a pretty economical choice for lunch, the entrees are definitely pricier!  I would consider ordering from here again for lunch and trying some other dishes."}
{"text":"Lamb kebob. Rice. Tray of samplers. Very friendly staff; manager owner on the floor when not in the kitchen. BYOB place with a nominal corkage.  First time last night with a small group. Love the simplicity of the internal layout and decoration. We are going back again.//   UPDATED REVIEW HERE// Back last night.  Aromatic rice excellent.  Service excellent.  Very much a small, family place with people and ambiance.  Manager/owner came out again and said hello to everyone.  This is NOT a chain store but a neighborhood foody hangout.  Lots on the menu.  We will be going back again.  Other items on the menu to sample.  But for me, the issue is that this is not a cooky cutter place.  It is unique.   Roy"}
{"text":"The quality and taste of their homemade food is very good. Service is okay. Again, meat kabob and chops are out of this world. My Sirian friend gave their lamb 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"Had a chicken shwarma for lunch.  It was nice and big.  I thought the taste was ok.  Looking forward to going back to try something else."}
{"text":"It was another Friday flip-of-the-coin night out. The old haunts were a little dull, the two local spots have turned out to be on the right wing, so our money doesn't go there anymore (which is sad, because they really are the better that Bellevue has to offer). It came down to a toss between Spice Island Tea House, and after a Yelp scan of Squirrel Hill, Naya. Since my better half is a student, he didn't care to enter Oakland again, so we didn't even need a coin to flip. We decided to try Naya.  I've been up and down that strip hundreds of times and went right past it. Another review commented that they need to make the exterior look more like it's a restaurant...and I have to agree. That whole building is a little out of place for Squirrel Hill, looking more like a suburban strip mall than a row of businesses in 'the city'. On first glance, it could have been a nail salon for all we knew.  We entered a very nice space, with a very charming and adorable young server named Fadi (I believe) who got us settled in, gave us our menus and the initial exposition of the restaurant. I hadn't had decent middle-eastern in a while, so I looked forward to giving this a try.  I ordered a Turkish coffee to start, which always kind of registers as backwards in middle-eastern restaurants, but I've not had one in such a long time, I needed that dark sweetness in my mouth immediately. And it did indeed satisfy. Thick and flavorful. How coffee is supposed to be.  As starters, we ordered a falafel appetizer and a plate of hummous. The hummous came garnished with parsley, olive oil and extra whole chick peas, with the pita wedges and a delicious side of dipping sauce of zatar, which is some kind of green herb and sesame seeds. The falafel was exactly as falafel is supposed to be. Perfectly crispy on the outside, and still moist on the inside. Served over a bed of chopped lettuce, tomatoes, a lemon wedge and the yogurt dipping sauce.   Fadi was perfectly attentive and very friendly, so the other reviews complaining about 'service' need to go back and have him as your server. I can't imagine having a complaint about him. He was chatty without being goofy or overboard, and kept our table in perfect order.  For our entrees, we were a little sticker shocked by the prices of the meals, and then we found the sandwiches on the menu and read the description of the Naya Burger...a lamb patty topped with tabouleh, feta cheese, tomato and mayo on a brioche bun. THAT sounded amazing. And as it turns out...an excellent choice. The price was just as reasonable as most of the hipster burger joints in town (actually, even MORE reasonable - at $9.99), and the lamb was seasoned perfectly and mysteriously, with the toppings adding to the experience. This was a perfect and filling meal.  Now, the four stars are for the pricing. The food quality is delicious. But when prices are too high, I just can't go back that often. But, that being said, with the sandwiches as options, most under $10 each, I would definitely consider going back when I was in a mood for a burger, and avoid the Burgatory kitch, or the Winghart's corporate downslide.  The atmosphere was comfortable, The clientele was a very nice mixture of neighborhood folks, college students and internationals. Fadi was a total delight, the food was excellent, and it was a perfect date night for us. An unexpected nice surprise.  Thank you Naya! Sorry we didn't meet you sooner."}
{"text":"Excellent and interesting food served by pleasant people...Syrian meatballs with pomegranate sauce was delicious...also grape leaves and falafel....reasonable prices, good service...don't hesitate- GO!"}
{"text":"Very good. Excellent service. Beef swarma & kale dishes very tasty. Was a pleasant surprise,  everything was cooked fresh & to order."}
{"text":"The decor is outdated. The place seemed mostly clean. The service was good.   We got the small appetizer with Tabbouleh, Baba Ghanoug, Grape Leaves along with Sambousik. The appetizers were delicious.  However, they need to fix their grill- what we got was salty. It shouldn't come with rice, it should come with spicy pita bread, vegetables and fries. There should be an option, at least. The quantity was too little for the price, as well.   Overall it's fine. The appetizers are excellent. The main entree was disappointing."}
{"text":"We stopped in after seeing a movie because we just wanted to try something new. The falafel was excellent as well as the hummus. The place was rather empty but at least the food was good. I give it a 4 out of 5 because I wouldn't pay for one of their 20 dollar dishes but I was fine paying 8 for a really good falafel pita. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've been to Naya a couple times and have had only mediocre experiences - nothing terrible, but not stellar either. We've gotten the appetizer sampler with baba ghanoush, hummus and tabbouleh twice and the dips just weren't very good. I don't know what it is, but they've had very watery qualities to them or just been very heavy on the tahini. The mujadara and lentil soup were also a miss for us. I've had the lamb here in the past which was alright, but in the same visit, we also received dirty water glasses with rice stuck inside the cup and we had to ask a couple times to get new glasses. You might find more success in trying other menu items, but between the lackluster hummus and the service hiccups, I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I really like Naya. The staff is always friendly, however, it seems they have recently undergone some changes. The prices are a bit steep for the portion sizes, and they changed what comes with your meal, though they have been kind enough to substitute the old dishes for me each time I order since I'm a returning customer. My favorite dish is their Chicken Shawarma. The sauces are so yummy. I'm also a fan of the Fattoush Salad."}
{"text":"Really delicious. I got the lamb chops, mashed potatoes, veggies and a salad (a dinner plate). The owner/chef Radua was really sweet and the service was good. I just got it to go but this place deserves more business their food is great"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch.   We were served pita bread with zaatar and oil which was delicious.    I ordered the sleek which was delicious.  The waitress did mention that all dishes come with salad, but I did not receive one and neither did my friend.  The sleek was delicious! It is a plate of kale and black eyed beans with cracked wheat and rice pilaf. It was delicious and filling! I loved it.   Their tahini was not to my liking and when I requested hot sauce I was given red hot, which is not really what I expect when going to a Mediterranean restaurant.  Overall I can't wait to go back and try some other dishes!"}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant--there are many middle eastern places around, but Naya does something different and pulls it off nicely. The Naya shrimp, seasoned with lemon and pistachios, was quite good. Nice for a moderately fancy dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to Naya's 3 times in the last 3 weeks--and planning a fourth trip in the next few weeks with my kids when they're back in town. I'll order the olive chicken again, I love that dish! We also ordered the mezza platter and chicken kebobs. All very good! The food tastes very fresh, and the portions are generous.   Naya's has never been crowded when I've been there, and I'm not sure why, since the food is so delicious. One reviewer pointed out that the exterior isn't exciting or enticing--agreed! But the food inside is wonderful! Four stars instead of five because sometimes the service has been slow--though always warm and friendly. Today we called in our order ahead of time so that we wouldn't have to wait. Good strategy!"}
{"text":"I cannot figure out why this place is not always packed with a line out the door, because it is hands down the best Middle Eastern food I've ever had - and I'd even say it's one of the best restaurants that Pittsburgh has, period.  Don't let the bland, unsassuming Italian-ish decor put you off.  It's super clean and well-kept, but blah - but they are also planning quite a renovation, although I don't know the time frame.  As others have said, it is family-owned, as, of course, most ethnic restaurants are.  I've only met the Syrian owner's niece (Noor) and nephew (Ali) so far, but they are both absolutely lovely.  The food is just out of this world, too, freshly and perfectly cooked to order and absolutely bursting with beautifully blended flavors you just don't often encounter.    They do have all of the things we Americans expect of a Middle Eastern restaurant - the shish kebabs, hummus, falafel, dolmas, and so on - but the majority of the menu goes way, way, way beyond these, and is where you should really focus if you love food, because that is where the really authentic cuisine begins.  Just like Mexican food is far from being all tacos, burritos, chile rellenos, refried beans, and so on, Middle Eastern food does not end with what we see on most menus by a long shot.  I've been here twice now, and have had fabulous meals both times.  The other day, I ordered two main courses (one of them the full dinner, not just a la carte, so it included a side salad and a side of couscous) and two or three other sides, plus baklava for desert - and the whole bill was all of around $40.  I am now on my *fourth* meal out of all of this, the portions are so large.    My first visit, I had the Persian lamb shank, which is \"braised in an aromatic sauce of exotic spices and dried fruits\", and was every bit as fabulous as it sounds.  The other day, I was so tempted to get that again, but decided to sample more of the menu instead, and got the bamia with beef dinner, which is okra cooked with beef, onions, and green peppers in a very flavorful tomato sauce.  I've had bamia before and been underwhelmed, but this was to die for.  The full dinner includes your choice of several sides, including rice pilaf like every other Middle Eastern restaurant serves, but I opted for the couscous, which came out fluffy and light and simply marvelous.  I also ordered the sleek, which again, I'd had before but not really liked all that much, but here was absolutely divine.    Stuffed grape leaves are always a must for me, and the Syrian version is served hot with your choice of dipping sauce; I chose the hummus.  Tabouli was also excellent - the mostly parsley version which is not my personal preference, but I still like it, and it was light and fluffy and totally delicious.  Both the bamia and a few other dishes can be served without meat, too, and they have an entire vegetarian section on the menu for those of you who don't eat animals.  They also have a broad list of various meats, poultry, and seafood.  My first time there, they also served me some warm pita with a very unusual spiced dipping sauce made from a very unusual spice blend I had just discovered through Blue Apron whose name totally escapes me at the moment, and was out of this world.  I don't know if they have discontinued that, forgot it the other night, or figured I might not want it because of everything else I ordered, but I hope it was one of the latter two reasons, because it was excellent.  Even the simple green salad had a slight twist on the typical Middle Eastern salad dressing with the addition of some kind of seasoning I've not had in that context before, which I totally lit up about upon first bite.  Baklava was baklava; that is really hard to screw up.  They serve it with a drizzle of chocolate sauce, which I personally will ask to be left off the next time, but it made for a beautiful presentation, and certainly there are people who will prefer it.  They pay attention to the details from start to finish.  The food is beautifully presented, and the check comes in a lovely inlaid wood box that is, I would guess, typically Syrian.  Unfortunately, they are also BYOB, but again, don't let that stop you.  In keeping with my other reviews, the place, sadly, is *not* wheelchair accessible - *but* they do have some kind of temporary ramp that they will bring out if you call them and let them know you need it.  How adequate it is for a power chair, I don't know because I didn't look at it, but they are at least trying to address the issue as best they can for the time being, which is a thousand times better than most other places.  They are very well aware of the problem and *do* plan to rectify it properly, along with some other badly needed renovations/redecoration that they are in the process of starting to plan for, so don't let this deter you.  Go eat here; you won't regret it. And you'll help them stay in business, for which I personally will forever thank you :-)"}
