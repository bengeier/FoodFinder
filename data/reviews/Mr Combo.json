{"text":"Good middle eastern style food. We came as a party of 3. We tried the falafel appetizer, kabob (mixture of beef and lamb), chicken tabaka (also known as butterfly chicken), and the salmon dish. All of these were well prepared and juicy.

Each main course includes a salad and pita bread. as well as a side dish. We got the home-style potatoes. I also recommend trying the napoleon cake for a dessert - can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I got the lamb pita on whole wheat, I asked for it to be cooked medium well. It was well done.  The sandwich lacked flavour and was dry.  
The perogies & falafel were good. The falafel didn't taste like traditional falafel. The ingredients are definitely different. 
My sister got the chicken pita the chicken has a strange taste. The spice they use is not that tasty to us. 
I don't think I would return but the staff is friendly and it looked fairly clean."}
{"text":"Absolutely consistent in quality and portions
Great Osso Bucco."}
{"text":"This is one of the best and most authentic middle eastern restaurants around! Although the name suggests a fast food oriental restaurant, this place is anything but that. Food is homey and delicious and reasonably priced with very generous portions. 

My recommendations would be the hummus, chicken shish kabob, and shawarma. 

Great place for lunch!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very clean.  Very well run eastern european restaurant.  Don't be put off by the 60's decor and the ridiculous name \"mr combo\", no asian food here, just excellent eastern euorpean and middle eastern - falafel, schnitzel, soups and great desserts."}
{"text":"hello

had this food last weekend. i ordered over the phone and i must say i was very impressed. i ordered for maybe 20 people. the food was very good and very warm when it arrived.  they were not cheep at all about any extra sauces or pita we ask for
i will for sure be back and think of this spot when i have big events!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch for the first time, had a great lunch special for under $9. Food was delicious, chicken skewer was moist and flavorful, sides were good too. Don't let the small inconspicuous entry deter you from trying this place. Lunch special came with a drink and pitas. I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Sweet sassy molassy, that's a good falafel pita.

I came here for some takeout pitas with a couple of my coworkers. Two of us got falafel pitas and one got a chicken shawarma pita with extra coleslaw and feta inside.   We were all blown away by how delicious our meals were. First of all, they're the size of a nerf football, the pitas are absolutely packed full of fillings including hummus, tahini, tomatoes and cucumbers. Secondly, the falafels were incredible. Moist and flavourful, and the chicken (I tried a bite.. I had to)  was perfectly tender and spiced.

We've found our new favourite take out spot for lunch, and the fact that it's only $5.60 taxes in for the falafel pita is an extra plus. 

Next time, I'm going to try the veggie appetizer plate I saw a lady mowing down on in the restaurant which had hummus, baba ganouj, olives, fried eggplant, beets and mushrooms!! 

They also offer a \"Business lunch\" featuring meat with a selection of sides and salad for $9. I'll probably eat in next time as their dining room looked really pleasant and comfy."}
{"text":"LAFFA  over  Shawarma any day-  Makes your puny little pita shawarma look like midget league.  Im just trying to be funny like that @bianca A. Obviously failing!

However this place is amazing. Their specials on the chalkboard are what you have to keep your eye on. Usually have a different fish based on season. Their meat is of high quality.

One thing I did notice is that they switched ownership and the new owner is a little sheepish, he seems like he's sleepy all the time and doesn't want to work. He wont even hire a waitress. its just him and his wife serving in their floral slippers. Its actually kind of funny. They must be smart to buy this place though- LOCAL GEM!

The reason for it being a gem- is the chef. Glad he stayed around, this sri lankan man is a bawse on the stove top. He made this creamy pasta with mushroom which seemed like nectar from the rains of heaven dripping on to my not so worthy tongue. So good, it was one of those specials that I mentioned earlier on the chalkboard, its not a staple item that is found on their menu.

I will definitely be back- Just hope they have a proper waitress/server next time!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonite. It was 630 p.m. (on a Sunday nite) and it was packed to capacity (42 seats). This restaurant is nestled in a small strip plaza on the north east corner of Bathurst/Sheppard and clearly a popular neighborhood restaurant. 
I ordered a small appetizer of 6 salads...and loved everyone of them. Fresh and tasty would be the first words to come to my mind. I especially liked the babaganouj. 
I also sample a perogie and a devoured the falafel balls. Nothing to complain about.
Great food and reasonable prices. Whats not to like?"}
{"text":"Mr combo is located in a place where you really wouldn't expect to find too much good food but i've found it to be pretty decent. Most people who eat here are regulars and the staff loves chatting them up. Im not the biggest shawarma fan and so i got an order of perrogies. Their perrogies are deep fried and quite delicious although i was surprised to find that they were served with hummus. My friend tried a chicken skewer dinner which had a lot of food and two skewers of chicken. The chicken was lightly seasoned and pretty good. One of the best parts about eating here is the service. The staff is extremely patient and willing to suggest different items on the menu. The restaurant is a bit basic but very clean. You can look into the kitchen at the counter and wont find too many surprises. Overall a good choice if you're in the area and don't want to travel for food."}
{"text":"Good food and a clean open kitchen. Nothing to complain about. Better than others in the area."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you it's not Chinese take out its middle eastern food . Tucked a little out of view its defiantly worth a second take ..lots of food for your buck and freshly made  very friendly and welcoming . One   Shawarma is more then enough for two people very authentic"}
{"text":"Mr. Combo 'bish slaps' people with confusion on what gets cooked up in here, as 'combo' brings to mind fast, cheap chinese food or a Big Mac and nothing close to coma inducing middle eastern eats..wait, what? TENDER chicken slices in massive proportions filling in an equally gigantic pita ready to explode!!!! 

Yes, all for $6!! No,they don't have the 2 for 1 deal mostly offered on Lawrence, but who cares!??! Champion of the champs worthy of a main event without the Mayweather facade.

Order before hand for pick-up 'chicken shawarma in a pita (because you have a choice if you prefer it with laffa) with everything jam packed in that bad boy, then ask for it to be packed in a container and lotsa napkins to avoid ruining a perfectly good outfit because things will get messy.

Half drool and half sauce fight their way outta my mouth with a complete temporary mental block. Who would've known this place in an old plaza can renew your faith on 'mom n pop's' culinary talent in showcasing fast, quality food served with plenty of TLC?

Come down and come hungry!!! Located in a very busy intersection, plenty of commuters and parking is pretty bad. The struggle works up an appetite so God is on your side, my friend!"}
{"text":"By far one of the most amazing traditional middle eastern restaurant I've been to in years !! Amazing food, great and friendly staff. The laffa shawarma, chicken thigh and lamb chop skewers are a must to try!! And so is everything else! The Napoleon home made desert that is made by the owner who specializes in baking is just a taste of heaven. Never had anything like it before! Plus the prices are great and the portions are huuuuge, definitely worth it! If u are not trying it u are missing out!!!"}
