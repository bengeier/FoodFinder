{"text":"You can't go wrong doing anything at Desert Mountain. The Cochise/Geronimo clubhouse is spectacular with a view of the entire valley that is un-matched. Give the Chiracuaha golf course a try you won't find a better layout in the state."}
{"text":"The golf course is well manicured.  The  club.house is  beautiful.  Spectacular  views . Friendly  staff . Greens are fast but  hard to read . . The course  is very challenging.  It is about 7 degrees cooler  than the city. It is worth  the drive. We had a great time there . We played  in the golf tournament  shot 32 under with handicap  but came in tied for second"}
{"text":"This is the finest golf and social club in the world.  I have been fortunate to be a member for 24 years and lucky end ugh to sell real estate in the community for 23 years.   
If you see it , play it , and can afford it you will buy it . 
No place is Nirvana but this is darn close !"}
{"text":"I went here for a wedding and it was the most amazing location for a wedding in AZ that I have been too. If I ever were to get married in AZ (0% chance of that), this would be the spot where I would want to do it. 
This was at just one of the many clubhouses in the Desert Mountain community which is in uber upscale north Scottsdale. The Cochise/geronimo clubhouse was a mixture of contemporary/desert style.  Enormous windows over looking the amazing views of the desert mountains. The Patio was huge and accommodated around 125 people to watch the amazing sunset over the mountains. The food they served was pretty descent for wedding food. I just had the pasta, but the salad was a cucumber avocado salad that was def the most fancy wedding salad I have had. 
The bathroom had all the great upscale amenities like mouthwash, sunscreen and lotion. 
If you are planning on getting married soon in AZ and have a ton of cash to blow I suggest checking this place out as it will blow your guests away!"}
{"text":"Came here for a wedding and it was breath taking.  Wedding ceremony on held on the one of the driving areas that overlook the golf course and into the city.  The sunset was just beautiful.  The clubhouse has amazing and relaxing environment.  We had drinks on the patio (great for photos).  Had heater lamps so we ate on the other side of the patio.  The food was pretty good.  Steaks, chicken, and fish.  Tons of sides and bread.  Service was top notch (bar, servers, etc.).

{"text":"We dine here regularly.  Everything about this place is the best of the best of the best!  The best service, the best food and the best decor in all of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Exceptional restaurant! The food, service, location, view and ambience was unbelievable. This evening was so spectacular I would have believed that it was a dream if I had not been with my friends. This restaurant deserves ten stars. Words pale to try to describe the evening."}
