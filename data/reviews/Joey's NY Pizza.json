{"text":"Joey is the best! Love their pizza. I am not form the East Coast so I don't know what NY pizza is supposed to taste like, but I just know that I like the pizza. Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"What is so confusing about the phrase \"well done\" when ordering a pizza?   I asked for well done, made the mistake of arriving to pick it up before it was ready, practically begged them not to rush since I wasn't in a hurry, and like clockwork with so many Vegas pizza places I get home and it isn't even cooked enough, let alone well done. Infuriating."}
{"text":"Great local pizza joint!  High quality, fresh ingredients.    Excellent pizza, fries, and amazing onion rings!  Super friendly staff.  We missed Sam when he left Rocco's...but we found him here!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in after shopping Friday night.  GREAT pizza.  Nice guys behind the counter.  Lots of neighborhood folks coming in who appeared to be happy regular customers.  Big menu to choose from! We will DEFINITELY be back!!!"}
{"text":"JOEY'S NY pizzeria reminds me of home. If you are a Yankees, knicks, giants even a jets/mets fan...JOEY'S pizzeria will make you feel at home. Joey is a very nice guy, very welcoming, and the food is good to boot. Give it a try and you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"Very unclean pizza joint. Employees handle cash and then make pizza without washing hands. They sell pizza by the slice that's been sitting out uncovered. They just got 39 demerits from the health dept. as seen on Chanel 13 dirty dining. Can't recommend ."}
{"text":"Very Good Pizza. I love the regular pie and this place is absolutely worth trying. This place is 95% New York Pizza . The only reason it does not get 100% is because it's not in New York."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas by far. No one can compare. Authentic NY pizza. Chicken rolls and calzones are top notch. Take my word for it. Born and raised in the best borough in NY (Brooklyn). Real Polly-o mozzarella and ricotta. We are addicted. I am eating a slice while posting this review."}
{"text":"Joey makes one of the top 3 pizza pies in Las Vegas, and the staff bangs out classic NY thin crust slices just like everyone remembers.  Here are some things you may not know: Joey's meatball recipe comes straight from his mama's kitchen, and they are a perfect blend of beef, pork, and veal combined with just the right spices. Next up, Joey's wife makes delicious cannolis...ask if any are available for purchase.  Yes, they have chicken fingers and sandwiches, but what do you go to a pizza shop for ?   Great pizza, so keep it simple and enjoy Joey's Pizza at least once a week like I do."}
{"text":"It seems like I never get a favorable response from calling this place. Sometimes they don't answer the phone at all. Tonight I called at 8:14 PM for delivery and was told \"No More Deliberies\" before they hung up on me. I won't be calling them ever again."}
{"text":"Have no idea if the pizza is good or not.  Mid Sunday afternoon, call and place order for a med pizza to be picked up.  Wait 15 of the 20 minutes the girl said it would take to get it, drove down in a rain storm from Anthem to pick it up. Stood at the counter being ignored for 5 plus minutes.  Finally was acknowledged and said I had a pizza to go.  Owner said I did not, that no one had ordered a pizza recently. (Wow, that busy, huh??)  I said I know I had the right place as I had discussed it with the female who answered the phone making sure I did in fact have the right place that had been rec to me by my sister.  Girl goes over to where the receipts are on a spindle and there was my order which they said they would go make.  I told them not to bother as my husband and dogs were sitting in the car.  Nothing was said or done or no apology for their error other than oops! Too many other good pizza places in the area like Buon Gusto and Metro...so oops, I won't ever be back and will tell all my friends too!"}
{"text":"Very good - their specialty slices/pies were particularly good, as well as their plain (\"cheese\") - the place is better than others, but not incredible."}
{"text":"This pizza place is absolutely INCREDIBLE! I am from New York & after moving here and trying countless pizza places I randomly stumbled upon Joey's NY pizza and thank god I did because this is the ONLY pizza place that actually tastes JUST LIKE NEW YORK PIZZA! I frequently visit Joey's, and along with there delicious pizza, hero's, salads & wings the staff is incredibly friendly, amazing & caters to all your needs. THANK YOU JOEY'S NEW YORK PIZZA, you all ROCK!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I have ever tasted in the city of Las Vegas. Perfection. It's all I can think about right now and we ate the pizza two hours ago. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"10/29/15 Ordered pick up since deliver was 70mins.... pizza was ok... ordered medium pepperoni,sausage,/onions pizza and plain wings with hot on the side. The wings and sauce were great... not sure ill order again anytime soon but its on the mental menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza right here! Friendly service, and good food. Check it out if you love pizza. Not to mention I have relations with the owner of this place, so I'm special :3"}
{"text":"I am from New York and this is literally the best pizza!! Its delicious,  so happy that I found this place. I always order a large cheese pizza with well done crust. Great location with plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I like it. Great crust. This is a traditional NY style pizzeria. It makes me happy. Glad they are in town. I'd eat here daily if my wife let me."}
{"text":"Diner's alert: this pizza place sells by the slice and , it seems to me, that pies to order are uninspired/the choices are limited. They also don't sell beer or wine. I didn't eat there because i like multiple flavor levels on my pizza and wine or beer with my pizza. This may be a a tasty pizza place but it wasn't what I was looking for."}
{"text":"My family loves joeys! They are all so nice! The pizza is great, the garlic knots to die for! They do get busy, so I would call ahead but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Me and some friends popped in after playing volleyball nearby and the pizza hit the spot. Huge slices and delicious. Wings were on point too. Sam and Nicky also took really good care of us. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just ordered first time here for a mushroom pizza this place is my new favorite place in Vegas! Thin crust mushroom cheese perfect with the sauce crust was fluffy will be coming back"}
{"text":"Tossed salad= romain lettuce, 5 very small cherry tomatoes and 5 olives for $5.99 ! ! ! ???  Won't ever do that again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in vegas!  I don't know where they get the ranch from but it is by far the best I've had! Pizza has the perfect mix of crispy and doughy."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Vegas hands down! My kids ask for it by name, not by we want Pizza tonight!!  The White pie is amazing as is his Sicilian pie!!  I enjoy his Pepperoni pie with a glass of Merlot.  I can almost eat an entire large by my self and not feel bloated or overly stuffed after....unlike the chain pizza places where the crust and cooking grease make you regret your food choice soon thereafter.  The wings are also great, much better than most wing places and perfect for football or a fight night. I don't always eat Pizza, but when I do...it's JOEY's!"}
{"text":"My only complaint is that they are closed on Tuesdays.    The cheese pizza is on a regular dinner rotation for my family.  Even my picky 2 year old will only eat the cheese pizza from here. No where else.    Garlic knots are delicious and powerful.  Don't eat a garlic knot from here before going into: 1. an interview, 2. blind date 3. anywhere that requires fresh breath.    Pizza is a fiercely debated item but this little establishment makes a great pie and we're extremely happy with their quality."}
{"text":"Best Pizza In this town.  Thank you for bring Eastcoast Pizza to Vegas.   Kinda feel sorry for the people that have never been to the Midwest and Eastcoast. They have no Idea how good food can be.   But thanks to Joeys Pizza now you can have GOOD food.   If you haven't been to this place yet.  GO..  Oh and the best part.  Their not on Westcoast time.  Meaning you got you food fast fresh and Hot.  EASTCOAST is not full of lazy people.."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood, Anthem, first time here,excellent! Ordered a medium pizza w/mushrooms and olives and order of chicken wings carry out.  Order came out fast and very good! Wish they served beer!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Good pizza and a few italian dishes/sandwiches. For a pizza place, you'd think they would be open later.  But their food is good and they know pizza. (Even though I'm partial to Chicago style deep dish)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas. They have my allegiance. Very friendly as well. Joey is a stand up guy."}
{"text":"Just found this place and will not order pizza from anywhere else around green valley again. Would highly recommend this place to anyone. Told the owner it was my first time there as I was walking out and he said \"you'll be back\" he's absolutely right. Good job over there guys! Keep it up"}
{"text":"Great pizza! The subs and dinner, as good a frozen dinner. The garlic knots are a joke. about the size of a quarter. Pizza is great!"}
{"text":"I know pizza and this is the REAL DEAL My mom who is super picky about her food Joey you won her over!!! They are great from start to finish. Awesome customer service we couldn't be happier.   Sincerely  The Trujillo family"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service - Joey and Sammy were so friendly. Excellent pies, fried raviolis, calzones and cheese cake. We have yet to have anything that wasn't delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered their grandma pizza, garlic knots and wings for pick up. All were very good! No complaints, will definitely order from them again!"}
{"text":"Real Ny pizza! Made my night. The cheese was great. The canoli's, garlic knots and the margarita pie hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Wings are the best. Even there lunch special is great. 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $4.99 is awesome. People are friendly there, place is very clean."}
{"text":"Pizza is really good and tasty.  The cheese and sauce are good quality. The wings were excellent, crispy and a lot of flavor. The blue cheese was great with Large chunks of blue cheese that definitely hit the spot.  Keep up the good work guys"}
{"text":"After ordering just once, my husband and I are ready to call this our pizza place. We got Grandma's Pie Pizza and it is the closest to NY pizza I've had in Vegas. It has that thin, chewy crust that you'd expect from an east coast pizzeria. Delicious. Delivery was fast and the food was hot."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst pizza we've ever had in the 15 years we've been in Vegas/Henderson.  It was so soggy, you had to support it with a spatula to pick it up.  The cheese and toppings would just slide off the crust.  It was like trying to pick up a huge wet noodle.  We paid over $33 for a medium (which is their smallest size) cheese and large 3-topping.  It took 1-1/2 hours to arrive despite the fact that we live less than 2 miles away and was a big disappointment, especially since we were starving by the time it got here.  I would never bother reviewing anything unless I'd had an extreme experience, good or bad, and this was definitely the latter.  It's really a shame because they have a great location."}
{"text":"I stopped in after a doctor appointment next door and was pleasantly surprised to see they sell pizza by the slice. So many times I'm craving pizza but do not want to order a whole one!  In addition to ready made pizza, they have garlic balls too. I love the garlic balls because they are soft and covered in so much oil (in a good way!)...very different than garlic bread or knots that you get at other places. They are probably what I like most from this place! So yummy! Ask for marinara to go with them.  The inside is decorated all in NY memorabilia. You really feel like you're in NYC getting a slice of pizza when you're in there. The staff is polite and I love the NY accents. They have a few tables to eat there, but I took mine to go.  I've only tried the pizza and garlic balls, but they have a full menu. Next time I'm going to try a sub...I saw a couple people order them and they looked really good too. They seemed pretty busy with pick up orders, so I think this is a little popular place!  Another plus...they deliver!"}
{"text":"Placed an order through Yelp.  20 minutes after placing the order, I received a call to tell me it would take 90 minutes... yes, 90 minutes for a pizza.  Of course I cancelled and recommended they be removed from this service on Yelp.  Huge waste of time!!!"}
{"text":"Great great pizza.  I've had delivery twice now from here.  Its been great both times.  My boyfriend nearly eats a whole large to himself because its that good lol We definately found our new pizza place!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat and priced right. Secondly that right behind us , so delivery is only minutes to us. I recommend this place with thumbs up."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town and I'm from NY so I know pizza. Just delicious!! Everything else is very good too. Yummy. Also recommend the garlic knots. Ciao!"}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza. My 8 year old will only eat and compare others to Joey's.  Do pick up as delivery can take time as they are popular. Reviewing because they're a small shop and don't deserve any low reviews Elon their pizza.  I'm from NY so I respect what they have going here. It's good. Try it."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was how good the place smelled. Then I ordered my pizza. The register guy was efficient and friendly. I could watch the guys in the back putting the pies together. Also efficient, and if the register guy was busy, they made sure to greet new customers as they came into the store. As for the pizza itself?  A work of art. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I've ever only ordered delivery. They are always so friendly when I call. They get to me in a timely manner. I've had the pasta, wings, pizza and garlic knots. My husband is from NY so we are pretty picky when it comes to Italian food. Joey's  is great for that craving if you are in the area. The pizza is just okay for me, but again I've only had delivery, and by the time I eat it, it usually gets pretty soggy. So maybe if you dine in, it might taste better. The garlic knots with a side of marinara is a must! Pasta is decent, wish they had rigatoni!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas.  Never had a better plain cheese pizza, it may be pricey but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I don't know what these others are saying about Joey's, but I find this to be the best pizza in upper Green Valley! Coming from New York, Joey's replicates the flavor and quality you New Yorkers are looking for!!!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza and fingers. Consistantly good. Make sure to ask them to do the pizza well done."}
{"text":"We just moved here from Green Valley. We need a new pizza delivery place so we tried Joey's.  OMG  We had a large cheese pizza.  Calzone with pepperoni black olives and sausage. The garlic knots and a side of Italian Sausage.  We finished the meal with their cheesecake.  OMG.  Joey's will not disappoint you.  Delivery was quick. 45 mins on a Saturday night is great.  Driver was very nice. Took care of our food.  The food was freakin awesome.  We will be regulars with Joey's.  Thanks for everything.  Price was average so that's an added bonus."}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza.  Small cozy atmosphere.  Only problem with this place is they are closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Good NY pizza they do by the slice and a whole pie.  Wait times can be long , so if you order to go plan accordingly if you want delivery is sure they give them at least an hour.  You can watch them make your order right in front of you good quality ingredients and a good pizza"}
{"text":"Just like NY pizza!  A gem in the rough! Being from NY I can tell you this is the closest you can get here in Vegas area to NY pizza!  Makes me feel like home."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent! The sausage was so good! Chicken wings cooked perfectly! Delivery service was great!! This is our new pizza place!!!"}
{"text":"This pizza was good when we got it last year however we got it again last week and it was really bad, crust was paper thin and soggy and toppings were very skimpy . wished I had just gotten store bought , took my kids to chuck e cheeses on eastern 2 days later and found their pizza much better."}
{"text":"Great pizza!!! I love the taste! The quality is great from the sauce to the crust!! Their pepperoni pizza is very delicious!!! I grew up in NJ and I'm very picky when it comes to good pizza. I approve this spot, and I'm thankful they're close by. The service is also always great and everyone has been really friendly! This is first on my list for places to tell my friends where to go for great pizza!! 5 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"My son goes to the Kung Fu academy a few doors down and after practice a couple weeks ago my husband and him tried a couple slices of pizza and raved to me about how good it was and that they want to try the Sicilian some time.  This past weekend we had the craving for some pizza so we ordered ahead of time and ate there on Sunday 11/23/14.  We were greeted by a very nice gentleman who put our pizza in the oven to just warm it up.  It came out piping hot...just like a pizza should!  There was a fair amount of pepperoni on the pizza.  It was a little greasy but we just wiped some of it with a napkin.  To end our meal we went ahead and ordered the Powdered \"Donut hole looking dessert (Forgot what it was called) and they were yummy!  This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Slow service, seems like a guys hangout rather than a business. Don't bother with delivery, it'll take forever. It's not very good and the pizza by the slice looks like it's old, curling up on the sides, but won't make another till they are out. If you're looking for a cheap lunch special, go. If you're looking for a good pizza , go somewhere else. Metro is a 5 minute drive."}
{"text":"The pizza was better than I expected considering the reviews.  Yes it was a little greasy but I expected that.  Good overall flavor."}
{"text":"Just tried Joey's Pizza for the first time and was very disappointed with not just the flavor of the pizza, but with their lack of customer service satisfaction stance of NO refunds. Seeing how this was my first order and basic understanding of food service is you don't want an unsatisfactory experience for any patron that this would warrant a refund. Mmm...NO. I was willing to bring the pizza back to them as well. I was plainly told they only issue refunds if the pizza was either burnt or if the order was processed wrong. Unsatisfactory in my opinion and obviously I'm disappointed with how they choose to conduct business for first time customers."}
{"text":"I have become a regular here!  This is my third delivery (handled professionally in all cases) and I have enjoyed a pizza pie in the storefront several times.  I really like Joey's pizza... the flavor is right, the size is right and the attitude is always friendly.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Greasiest pizza ever. Instead of ranch, they gave us blu cheese. And lastly, the pizza came at an hour and 10 minutes after they said it was only gonna be twenty five minutes. Called them after an hour and the driver just left. Ugh so disappointed."}
{"text":"I transplanted from NY (the bronx) at the tail end of 2009. Pizza has always been my favorite thing in the world to eat. I've tried about 90% of the places around vegas that boast they have NY style pizza....Joeys is by far one of about two places that make me feel as if I'm back at home ordering a pie on my walk from the subway so I can devour it upon delivery....."}
{"text":"IN this case I should have heeded some of the warnings on Yelp. I ordered the Supreme which has sausage, meatballs, pepperoni, onions, mushrooms and black olives. What a rip off, there was barely any toppings on this and by saying that I would say that there was a total of 4 pieces of pepperoni on the entire pizza and all of the other meats were scattered and scimply. There was a very thin layer of cheese and the pizza was undercooked. The bottom of the pizza was soggy. Pizza crust should be golden in color and this was not. Of course they put a lot of onions as filler. For 23 dollars, they should be much more generous. I think that I will stick with Montesano's next time, they are always top notch and generous with their toppings. To be fair, the staff was very nice, I can't say a bad word about their service."}
{"text":"Best New York pizza around!! This is  coming from a Brooklyn girl!!  We dine in weekly ... large cheese extra cheese and well done is how I order it... and the best Italian iced served in a paper cup!!  Just like home... friendly employees, make you feel at home... thanks Sam and E for the great pie cooked to perfection......."}
{"text":"My husband is a New Yorker, so any chance we have to get a \"true\" experience, without the airfare, we take. This place is HOME! The sausage, pepper, and onion hero sandwich is Gooooooood!! It's fabulous, tasty, and LOADED with flavor. The ambience is true NY, right down to the accents. We are in this neighborhood every couple of weeks and don't just buy for the day, we buy for several days.  Worth the drive... Worth the time: NY perfection."}
{"text":"Worst experience ordering pizza in my life! Don't waste your time coming here! Was quoted an hour for one pizza, it didn't show up until two hours later! It was $40!!! When I called to complain, I was put on hold. When the guy finally came back, he didn't apologize all he said was, \"we are busy, you got your food right? It's hot right?\" What a jerk. Never again! Spread the word, this place is downright awful!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy Pizza. Wonderful sausage roll. I haven't those on a menu since leaving the east coast over 30 yrs ago.  Only thing is drink selection is limited for dine in. Guessing most of their business is takeout/delivery."}
{"text":"These guys saved my life this past Saturday.   After long weekend of wedding parties, lots of booze, and not so much food, I was getting HANGRY! I finally made it home on Saturday night around 8:30pm, when suddenly my pizza gene flicked on, and my body said, \"You need melted cheese, bread, tomato sauce, and chicken fingers!   Not one to argue with my body I started to feverishly search the Yelp app for pizza. Not going to lie, I scrolled past Joey's NY Pizza the first time, because of their three star rating, but after searching, calling, and finding that most places wanted forty plus dollars for pizza along with a huge delivery fee; I went back to Joey's.   I called around 8:55pm and placed my order. I asked if they could deliver, but the guy on the phone politely said they had already sent the driver home because they close in five minutes, oh snap! I hopped in my car, set the Google map directions in motion and realized they're located right across the street.   When I arrived, the pizza was still baking, and the fingers were in the fryer. The guys chatted me up, and I apologized for ordering so last minute. They repeatedly said it wasn't a big deal and it happens all the time. I got my pie and fingers, and in the great words of Guy Fieri, I was headed to \"flavor town\".   For $14.99, I got an 18\" cheese pizza and also some fingers on the side, for a grand total of $28; which fed three people easily, with leftovers being abundant. The pizza was definitely NY style with its thin crust, which made for folding and easy eating. The fingers were spicy and still juicy, no dry birds ova-here!   Solid pizza spot and I will be going back. I mean, I can walk there!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to try a slice of pizza with my daughter as we are having guests later today and we were looking for some great pizza.  Absolutely delicious! We will be back later to get more."}
{"text":"Food is exceptional, ordered twice. Delivery was within the time given food was hot and amazing. Definitely a place to get true N.Y. pizza. Thank you for bringing a taste of home to Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I did not eat here today but I thought I would write a review in case anyone follows my posts and likes the same things I do.  I have eaten at this pizza place many, many times and they are by far, the most like NY pizza I have had in this area!  Great tasting sauce, great crust, great service, awesome garlic knots!  I only wish they could deliver to where I live but it is just out of their driving range.  Every time we go there the guys are very nice to us and the food is awesome.  I have never, ever had something to complain about here.  They do focus more on delivery to their area so the seating area is small - only a few tables inside.  I have only had to wait for a table once though."}
{"text":"If you like thin, New York style pizza, this is the place to go. The sauce is not overpowering, and the cheese and toppings are just right. I have had delivery from them twice, and the orders have both been early, correct, and the pizza still warm. I recommend them to my friends."}
{"text":"I know Pizza!  This is by far one of the very best in town.   I grew up in NJ eatting pizza 3-4x's a week.  Trust me, it's worth the drive....  I strongly recomend it...."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for delivery. Never again. The delivery guy was pleasant enough, but the pizza was just not what I expected. It was greasy, runny and cold. When I called the shop to let someone know that my pizza was not what I expected, I was put on hold for 13 minutes and when I finally did speak to Joey, he was really rude and mean. I get that it gets busy, and the last thing you need is a customer not being happy, but calling me a nasty name and hanging up with me was not cool. The shop must have caller ID because when I called back whoever was manning the phone would pick up and hang up. Not cool at all to hang up on a food blogger.  Thanks for the experience. If I ever need a pizza, it won't be from Joey's."}
{"text":"Good pizza but horrible wait times. We ordered 2 pizzas for delivery and it took 52 minutes. We were told 35-40m wait time. We decided to pick up the next time and it still took over 40 minutes for two pies!"}
{"text":"I thought for sure I have given this place a review. I have been 3 times already and have brought friends. This is a cozy little spot. It's no larger than a Subway restaurant. The place is clean and they play good 80s music inside, (when I went they were)  the menu is pretty good on  choices and the prices are hard to beat for what you get.  I had a slice of Pepperoni  and we got wings. Oh man the wings. I am dreaming about them. Today is my birthday and all I want is the Honey BBQWings  from Joey's NY Pizza tonight. So that's what I am going to get. The wings are naked with sauce of your choice and i mean to tell you, you won't be sorry. They also have pasta and salads too.   This place is hard to beat on price and  quality.  Enjoy,  I know i will."}
{"text":"The place is supposed to open at 11am, so says their website. My 3 year old is a very picky eater and will only eat cheese pizza when out and about. I read online that they offer \"pizza by the slice\". Perfect! So I went out of my way, and we waited nearby for an hour for the place to open. We arrived at 11:20am.   The place was still not open at 11:20am. I opened the door and chairs were scattered about and a guy was busily trying to get things ready. He told me, \"late start, we will be open in another 15-20\". 15-20 minutes with a hungry 3 year old 'ain't easy, especially after already waiting an hour. I decided to wait.   We went for a little walk, and a few minutes later the NY pizza place sounded very NY. Two guys right out front (they both seemed to work there as one of 'em was the guy I talked to inside) were having some sort of heated discussion, throwing F bombs left and right in earshot of me and my three year old, in front of the place as they set up tables. We left. Not the place for a three year old.   Needless to say, we didn't get to try the pizza. Probably never will."}
{"text":"I'm a native New Yorker recently retired in Anthem. Is this a good NY pizzeria?  Sorry. No. I wanted this to be good. I live so close by. A good pizzeria would have been nice.They try to come off as an authentic Bronx place. Not even close. What's wrong. Nearly everything. Bland pizza, chintzy on cheese and spices.. Small expensive antipasto salad. No provolone? Five thin slices of Genoa? Are you kidding me? Chicken parm and meatball heroes small and tasteless. If this place were in Morris Park or Tremont, they would never make it. I'll find somewhere else for sandwiches. The pizza is at least better than the chains. But lets call it the way it is. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Back after 2 years to give this place another try. Joey's calls their pizza New York style and it looks like NY pizza, the cheese and sauce is pretty good but really skimpy with both. The crust is definitely not up to par with a NY style pizza which killed it for me.  By the way ordered half onion and I could count the onions.....very cheap with the toppings and they are way to expensive for a pie. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Well we tried our new neighborhood pizza joint today. They could've earned 5 stars with better customer service.    I ordered takeout via Yelp.  A large order. I was very detailed on my order so there would be no confusion.  I ended my order asking nicely for plates, cheese and pepper flakes please.    We needed the food at the house before 7:30pm for the start of the playoff game.  I placed the order at 6:32pm.  The website said we would receive the food in 35 minutes.  After a large order of pizza, pasta, wings and dessert, I got a phone call from the restaurant.  They sold out of meatballs.  On a Friday night ... at 6:30pm.   I replaced it with Ravioli and Chicken Parm.    It took forever on the phone call.  They asked my what flavors I wanted on the wings...even though I already ordered them with flavors indicated.  She said she had no idea.  She asked whether we wanted ranch or blue cheese... even though I already indicated what I wanted in the original order.    Let's say NOT A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT THEY ARE GETTING MY ORDER RIGHT.    At this point it's 6:45pm.  I asked how long for the takeout to be ready. She says 45 minutes.  I say that's too late... can you deliver?  She says yes but it's a $4 delivery fee.    Serious??  Their mistakes and errors are making the order late, and they can't waive the $4 deliver fee??  6:30pm rolls around, no delivery.  We literally live 3 minutes from the restaurant.  At 6:45pm, I call and they say that the food is on the way.  It arrives at 6:50pm.  One hour and twenty minutes after the original order.    No plates as requested.  No cheese or pepper flakes.    If I was the owner or manager, I'm including a cannolli or a cupcake or a couple sodas... or anything that says \"sorry, we're new to your neighborhood and we made a mistake, but we want a second chance for your business.\"    Food wasn't bad. We would've returned with better service. Like the reviews on their Henderson location, they are stingy on pizza toppings.  Tough to understand given that they charge $15-18 per pizza.   We usually go to Rocco's which is good and has a bigger menu.  Or we takeout at Bambino's which is excellent.  Sadly we probably won't return to this location.  Poorly executed and even more poorly serviced."}
{"text":"I just found this great little pizza place and am so glad it's near my house. Authentic NY pizza, super thin crust, lots of cheese and fresh toppings. They always say it will be 45 minutes to deliver but show up in 20. Really friendly and a good deal. If you  are from the east coast and are used to the real deal, this is a great find. I have stopped ordering pizza from anywhere else."}
{"text":"Good pies and better customer service. I love to support the local business and this is for sure some of the best pizza ive had in Vegas. Even comes with a NY accent, the cannoli is good too."}
{"text":"Just moved out here, so haven't been to too many pizza joints but it was my birthday and I was broke so my older sister ordered me a pizza from joeys. Super yummy and flavorful sauce. The ordered came with garlic knots and they were amazing! Tho some marinara sauce would be perfect for them, but by themselves were good!!! Totally gonna try this place again."}
{"text":"Love their cheese pizza and the garlic knots are DELISH. Recommend pickup versus delivery, they have long wait times for delivery - just proves how good it is!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm I love this place. To the point where one one time I waited an hour and 45 minutes because they were backed up for pizza. Pepperoni and jalapeño pizza is the best. And their boneless wings with Buffalo sauce."}
{"text":"As far as NY pizza, this is as close as you will ever get in Las Gaygas. I'm from New York and the pizza there is phenomenal!   5 stars for taste and variety! They have a classic NY pizzeria menu and prices aren't too bad either.  It's a hole in the wall type place and quite easy to miss if you don't know where they are. They have a lot of posters and stuff on the wall and it's nice to look at while you wait for your food.   Now the only reason I knocked a star off is the wait time. The wait time was ridiculous, almost an hour for a couple of slices and a calzone. Was it good? Absolutely! But not everyone has the luxury of waiting an hour for lunch.   All in all, great pizza but slow service."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Even better service. We called late one night at they made our pizza for pick up and they didn't have to do that. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent NY style pizza. Rocco's may be slightly better, but Joey's is more convenient to Anthem. I look forward to trying the pizza and other items at Joey's again."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Great dinners, wings, fries, fingers, and rainbow cookies! Everything is delicious! Quality service and staff! Everyone is super nice and helpful. BEST PIZZA ON THE WEST COAST. They also have real Italian ices. Try the rainbow, chocolate, or vanilla chip."}
{"text":"Not a bad slice in a pinch.  The service is good and I've had a good pie and an ok pie.  I prefer New Pizza and Pasta, but it's way across town.  They do have a 2 slice and soda special that is reasonable."}
{"text":"First time eating pizza from Joe's.  Have to say I'm very impressed.  I ordered the Margarita pizza large.  Good dough,  good crust,  fresh ingredients,  and tasty.  I will be returning to try other options.  So far so good. Very impressed with this little pizza shop."}
{"text":"Better than Angelina's, which was my go-to for pizza since there's few places that deliver to Inspirada. A little pricey when delivered. Good flavor decent crust. Medium is 6 slices.  Delivery driver was friendly but it did take an hour."}
{"text":"Just moved in to the area and I thought I'd give the place a try. Pizza was excellent and I'm looking forward to trying their sandwiches and pastas."}
{"text":"I ordered from here about a week ago with my man.  I'm a vegetarian, and they had a lot of options for me.  The plain cheese pizza was to die for, and the cheese calzone was delicious.  The cheese was so rich and creamy, I wish I could've eaten more!  The cannoli's were also really good.  My family loves this place, and I will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"We order here on a weekly basis for our salon . The pizza is real good and crust is thin and light , with so many different varietys of toppings what's a girl to choose! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Imma born and bread New Yorker. I've had hundreds of slices from every borough, Deninos, Grimaldis, Prince St... You name it. This pizza might not be on that level but it is definitely the best slice in town!"}
{"text":"First time customers here! I'm already planning our next pizza night. The family agrees that this is the best pizza we've had in a very long time. We ordered a large pizza (crust sauce cheese perfection with fresh toppings), knots (amazing flavor and crispy chewy experience), cannoli and rainbow ice. The crew was meticulous and customer service forward. No disappointments here!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here for the first time.  Great looking pizza and even better tasting. Tastes just like something I'd get in New York.  Comparable to a competitor on the other side of town I won't name.  Will definitely order again.   Maybe try some wings or fingers. Great job, Joey's."}
{"text":"Best chic parm sandwich.. Back east quality.. Pizza really good...good find... Good parking.."}
{"text":"Back after a few year hiatus. 20 minutes from phone order to pick up. Thin, but chewy crust. fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"sorry folks but this was NOT good pizza.  Tiny bits of toppings, soggy crust and expensive.  On the flip side, the wings were excellent.  Large wings perfectly cooked in a medium spicy sauce.  Ricotta cheesecake had a nice vanilla flavor and whipped texture."}
{"text":"Omg!! This is the best tasting pizza !! Tastes just like back home..Yumm. We will definitely be back and so close to home !! So glad to see an old friend and sweet face again---SAM!!!"}
{"text":"Tastes like home!! If you are from NY this is the place to go and filled with NYers.  If you're not from NY and you want REAL PIZZA not the stuff around Las Vegas masquerading as \"pizza\" this is the place to go!  Great prices too. I go here a few times a month.  They have slices which is convenient for me as I don't need a whole pizza and the garlic knots are bite sized.   THIS HAS BECOME MY GO TO PIZZA PLACE! It should become yours too!"}
{"text":"Traditional NY style. Fabulous pizza. Great crust.  Joey is the pizza man, ya can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Delicious! The service was a little iffy, but to be fair both times we went we're on Friday nights when it was suuuper busy. I'll definitely be going back though"}
{"text":"Joke service was a joke, pizza not put in right away, the F garlic knots were never put in oven kid tried to serve them to me F cold, and told me my pizza would be THIN CRUST sicilian and it was NOT, I'm a F Ny'r this is NOT new york FOOD, and and they ran out of F chicken cutlet, how the f do you run out of chicken cutlet in a f pizza place????? WTF......  Horrible customer service NEVER AGAIN rip off too"}
{"text":"I ordered one pizza and asked to add as much toppings on it as possible. In 50min we received two pizzas which barely had any topping and on top of that they charged me 53$ instead of 20$ he said on a phone. Pizzas were very bad in taste too"}
{"text":"Placed an order through the Yelp app. Over two hours later I can finally get through to them and they informed me that the 45-60 minute wait time was incorrect. It would be delivered in 5-10 minutes.  Needless to say, it took 2.5 hours to get the pizza. I understand mishaps, but own your mistake and make it right. Definitely disappointed."}
{"text":"It took many years in Nevada before I found this place. This is the real deal Hollyfield. I think they even brought the New York water with them. I love it here and Joey is awesome too. Always fun to talk to and reminisce about the old times in the neighborhood. He even brings out my accent. My kids love it! Since I can't go home as often as I'd like and show my kids where Mom is from....Joey's is the next best thing!"}
{"text":"All im gonna say is this is the only place I go for pizza.  Im from NY and picky about my food. Joeys is one out of 3 places I order from when it comes to pizza. And its very rare that that you find pizza by the slice in Vegas. It's actually really frustrating.YOU MAKE A GREAT PIZZA JOEY!!!"}
{"text":"Clean place. Im SO HAPPY that Joeys opened. Roccos was getting worse and worse and when Joeys came into the neighborhood I knew we were finally in for some good authentic NY pizza cuisine. Let me tell you, I was right. The cheese is impeccable, the crust is just the right amount of crunch/crisp and tender fluffiness. Its fresh its delicious, ITS JOEYS! Not to mention I love the store manager. He remembers all of his customers and came over from Roccos and welcomed me with a big hug and smile when I walked in. My new pizza place. You wont regret it."}
{"text":"This place isn't that great, but I'd prefer to drive an extra 20 seconds to pick up a cheaper Joey's pizza than that joke of a pizza place Arrulios. Joey is greater than Joe Arrulio all day baby."}
{"text":"I can't argue that the pizza was quite good.  However, it seemed way too expensive for a place where the only reasonable option is take-out. Pizza is much better when you eat it right out of the oven, so we went there planning to eat in.  Joeys has one or two tables but there's zero ambience - a TV blaring, I think - and although they have a soda dispenser, it didn't work and they denied the ability even to serve us tap water!  (We could have purchased bottled water from them.)  We also got a slice of cheesecake to go which was partly frozen.  It tasted fine but was nothing special.  We doubt it was made there and it certainly was not fresh.  (Costco?)  Enh.  Although the staff seemed friendly enough, we probably won't patronize again just because the value isn't there."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good!! Classic cheese pizza you can't go wrong with. Garlic knots are heavy on the garlic, but I love garlic so I think they are very good! My favorite thing!? Their cannoli's!! So rich and creamy. I have eaten here twice and will continue to order from them. Pick up is usually ready in 25 min, which is not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Super friendly folks working super fast making delicious NY style Italian food! They are closed on Tuesdays so don't make the mistake we made 3 different times by showing up on A Tuesday! I had a chicken cutlet sandwich and it was the best chicken cutlet sandwich I've EVER eaten!"}
{"text":"We live pretty close so we end up eating there a lot. Try the garlic knots. they are really cheap and quite delicious. they are essentially dough in garlic oil. Joey is a true New York character."}
{"text":"Joey's. Oh Joey's.  I like this place. They've got some pretty good pies, some of the better ones I've ever had in Las Vegas. Personally, I think they're the best place that delivers in my area (South Green Valley/Henderson). I've had about 5 or 6 pies from this place and they've all been pretty good. Dough is thin, NY style, and the sauce is always on point. They can be a little greasy, but hey it's Pizza, not a Tofu salad.   Salads here are big, you can feed about 4-6 people from one order. Produce seems fresh, although, I can't tell if it's pre-packaged or not. But good, and I enjoyed it.  Now, this isn't to say this is the best pizza I've had in my life -- I'm being honest. It's GOOD pizza, though. Be prepared to spend a bit more than you would at your local Domino's but you'll have the peace of mind you'll be eating fresh dough, toppings, and ingredients. Not some bulk packaged, generic pepperoni and sausage.  Give 'em a shot. If you don't mind spending the extra bucks on something new, you won't be disappointed. Or at least, I hope you won't, you picky, picky person, you. ;)"}
{"text":"Very good pizza and wings its thin and just delicious a must try this place my kids loved it too thank you"}
{"text":"Been coming here a lot!  Very good freshly made pizza.  We always get pizza slices with sausage and mushroom toppings.  Sam is the best!!!"}
{"text":"\" You get what you pay for\".. Especially in buying pizza....If you are just happy with pepperoni, sauce & cheese on dough, and more concerned about the price,,then by all means ,go to Dominoes/Pizza Hut/Papa Johns.....but if you want an authentic, New York pizza, with a taste  that those chains can not match, I suggest Joey`s NY Pizza, on W. Lake Mead.....I have a similar review, but YELP does not let you edit your review, or comment on another review, which is why I don't like YELP.......and PleaSe, don't tell us how much your 8 year old kid likes the pizza, I know kids that think Little Caesars is the real thing...."}
{"text":"absolutely terrible -- we got delivery... a chicken parm sandwich, an antipasto platter and a small cheese pizza  the sandwich was not hot and not good (sauce tastes like it is out of a can and the cutlets taste like it was pre-bought and frozen) the platter was terrible! (and for $9!) the tomatos were sliced 6x6 -- not even attractive.  the proscuitto was slimy (like it was old) and the mozzarella was not fresh -- shredded out of a bag... the olives were canned sliced black olives... NOT IMPRESSED the pizza was not good at all -- no flavor and it was barely even hot  I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!"}
{"text":"This pizza has minimal toppings.  Requested 1/2 with pepperoni, sausage, onion and green pepper  I got 1 piece of pepperoni ,1 small piece of sausage, one sliver of onion and one small piece of green pepper on each of the three slices."}
{"text":"This really is some 5 star pizza! It's so hard to get good pizza in Las Vegas. I have another spot that I found for some good Chicago Deep Dish.... but Joeys New York Pizza is the best thin crust, New York style pizza in Vegas!!! My family devoured the cheese pizza in minutes after delivery! I love the white pizza and I add basil....delicious! Another bonus.... they have amazing chicken fingers!!  WHAT.... great pizza and great chicken fingers.... this is definitely our favorite pizza delivery place! We have ordered delivery three times now and all three times..... perfect!"}
{"text":"So utterly disappointing. Ordered from here many times without issue...until lately. Pizza crust is frozen and uber thin. Tastes like cardboard. Also, since when is a large pizza 10 inches around? Guy actually told us the boxes are larger than usual. Hysterical. I'm from New York. I KNOW PIZZA. AND ITS BOXES. LIAR. So upsetting because this was my go to spot. Did they change ownership?!?!!! I will never be back"}
{"text":"Great small quaint NY pizza feel. Fun and helpful customer service. Awesome looking and tasting food. Perfect to make a quick stop and fill up"}
{"text":"The pizza itself wasn't bad, but the heartburn and indigestion I got was horrible, I would never go back to or recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in all of Las Vegas. Fast friendly service is just the start. The inside of this pizza shop is decorated with New York everything. Subways signs and all. I have never been to New York but I feel like I get a little history lesson every time I sit down and eat my lunch there.   Joey's is great for all occasions. If I'm not too hungry I get the lunch special that comes with 2 slices and a soda. If I'm with my boss and were starving we will split a whole pie.   The cheese is amazing. The crust is not too thin not too thick. Great flavor in the crust. I enjoy it every time I have it, and I have it almost every week for the past year."}
{"text":"Called for delivery and was quoted and hour. Decided to pick up my order because my son wanted pizza. This is where the fun begins. Got home and bit into a raw chicken parm sandwich. Called to tell them that I didn't want a new one but they should be aware. They then told me to bring it in and I could get a credit. So not only do I not have dinner but I have to further inconvience myself by bringing the sandwich back so they can give me a. \"Credit\". Just do it right the first time and this won't be an issue. I won't be back!!! And everyone else should follow suit."}
{"text":"Good fresh hot pizza. We like the pizza and like that they deliver to our area. Glad to see them in Sun City."}
{"text":"Last Saturday was my second visit to Joey's NY Pizza. My first visit here was in December of 2016 when I tried their $4.99 two slice pizza and can of Coke special (added 50 cents for mushrooms). I left the pizzaria with the impression that their food was solid. However, I decided to postpone my review until I tried their eggplant parmigiana hero (in the New York area subs are called heroes). A year and three months later, I had the opportunity to try their eggplant parmigiana hero.     On a recent sunny Henderson morning, when I was walking around the nearby Sunridge Park, my mind was saying, \"Now that I am close to Joey's NY Pizza, this is the perfect time to try the eggplant parmigiana hero.\" I listened to my mind.     To many people living in the north part of Las Vegas Joey's NY Pizza might as well be in New York. It is in the far southern reaches of Henderson off Eastern Avenue where the main arterial splits with Anthem Hills Parkway by Anthem. It is in a small strip mall with a Capriati's. And it is very easy to miss it. My tip is that if you are heading south on Eastern Avenue that after you proceed past Sunridge Heights Parkway and the 76 gas station that it will be on the right.     With my mind set on the eggplant parmigiana hero, I handed  the woman at the counter $10.81. After giving me the change, she informed me that there is a 15 minute wait.     During the 15 minutes that I waited on one of the three stool seats overlooking Eastern Avenue, I took in the New York City themed dining room. The dining room is relatively small which gives me the impression that this is more of a take out and delivery business than casual dining. Besides the three stool seats there are three tables decorated in red and white table clothes and two outside tables. Where the room was short on seating it is big on the New York City motif. The large yellow wall opposite the counter features pictures of New York City including the skyline and subway signs. The three tables overlook the New York City pictures. At the opposite side, the small left wall by the stool seats are a NY Yankees shrine.     Speaking of shrines, their two page menu is a shrine to the NY pizzaria. The choices include calzones ($9.99), medium 14 inch ($11.99)and large 18 inch ($14.99) pizza pies, individual pizza slices ($2.50), heroes, cannolis ($3), eggplant parmigiana with a small salad ($12.99), and pasta with Mariana sauce ($9.99). Unfortunately fountain beverages are not on the menu. I have a slight pet peeve with drinking can soda. The want for a fountain beverage machine is one of the reasons that I ordered the eggplant parmigiana hero to go.    By the time that I devoured the hero, I had the exact opinion as the pizza. It was solid. At the $10.81 price point I felt that it should of been a real NY eggplant hero that is so loaded with eggplant and parmigiana cheese that I have to open my mouth wide to chew it. Working on this eggplant parmigiana hero I basically just opened my mouth. It could of used more eggplant and parmigiana cheese. The bread also needed room for improvement. It lacked that hot toasted bread taste. Additionally there were parts of the bread that were a task to chew. I rate it a three as in solid.     My return factor score here is 50%. That is not on account of bad food or service. Not the least! The reality is that Joey's NY Pizza is a distance from my hood at the same time there are closer pizzarias serving eggplant parmigiana heroes including Metro Pizza and Verrazano' that I have a higher opinion of."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in Las Vegas! Staff was great and food was delicious."}
{"text":"Pizza is a personal experience. Being from long island i can say withlout a doubt this pizza is just like home. Thank you. I also had salad, garlic knots and zeppole. Solid pizza 5 star. Go Joey!"}
{"text":"Order taker screwed up the address.  No call, we had to call.  The they say the food \"just left\" but it arrived cold and absent part of the order.  Pathetic customer service.   Just horrid and never again."}
{"text":"I moved from Times Square in New York City. So far, this is the closest to NYC pizza I've come to yet. I'm thrilled to have pizza like this in my.local neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is my go to pizza place for lunch! Super convenient because I work about 2 min. away. Their pizza is delicious & crunchy! Their lunch special comes with 2 slices of cheese pizza & a drink, additional toppings are .50 cents each, so if you get toppings it'll come out to around $6.xx which isn't bad at all. The slices are pretty decent in size. Sometimes they can get pretty busy during lunch time because there's usually like 1 guy doing everything by himself. I know they were looking to hire so anyone need a job? Haha."}
{"text":"This place should be shut down for false advertising, nothing at all like NY pizza. In fact most pizza places in Vegas are better than this. This pizza can be compared to Dominos except less cheese and skimpy toppings with a high price. I also ordered speghetti and it was like soup!  Please note that I asked them if it was really going to be like New York pizza, they promised it would, got my $25 and I got generic junk."}
{"text":"TLDR: average pizza prepared New York style.   Pros: fresh marinara sauce  Cons:  - Skimps on cheese and toppings in general.  - Easy to tell dough is of the frozen pre made kind (though it was cooked well).    I grew up on the east coast and consider myself to be a pizza buff.  It truly seems as if authentic New York pizza doesn't exist in the west.  This is definitely of New York style (big pies, super thin). The crust isn't bubbly like a true homemade pizza dough though.  It doesn't have the crunch and chewy texture either. Looks like the search continues in Henderson for real pizza worth the price.  Looks like I'll just stick to Neapolitan."}
{"text":"Ok in a pinch. 1st time I called for take out, they didn't answer. Weeks later, I tried again. Nothing exotic - basic sausage & onion.  Bland, skimpy distribution of meat & veggie.  While neighbors rave, I prefer Buon Gusto, just down the road. Doubtful return."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since I moved here! The delivery guy actually found my apt. The pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered a 18\" cheese pizza from here this past Sunday since my favorite place Franky's is closed Sundays. I have to say I was very impressed. First of all the 18\" to 16\" makes a huge difference. Then the pie was cooked perfectly to a light golden brown. The crust was light and airy and the pie had the perfect amount of cheese. I wish this place had more specials though involving the large pies especially on Sundays for football. I plan on coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Joeys is definitely a great little find I just happened upon it one night and it is now our go to for pizza! They do a traditional NY style thin crust that will blow your mind the menu is simple but it's all done just right the \"Jumbo\" chicken wings are drool worthy and delicious. Give them a try they do not dissapoint."}
{"text":"I love good old fashioned NY style pizza. I was disappointed with this pizza. Seemed like a frozen pizza re-heated. Not enough sauce, too dry. I think I'll try it again just to see if I visited on an off day because I've heard people rave about this place."}
{"text":"We haven't tried the pizza yet, the subs were really great though. Finally a place that understands the importance of bread! Fresh bread. Service was good, the sitting area is kind of lacking best for take out I'd think.  Worth a shot. A little pricey, but everything seems to be going up in prices these days so I am not sure if it's overpriced or if I am just cheap and still living in a Bon Jovi Video circa 1995..."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I had a coupon for a Pizza for $12.99, called them up and they were disinclined to honor it. I called Papa johns and got one for much less, I wanted to give a local store the business, but they gave me the business.  To make a 14\" cheese pizza, the cost is  less than $3.00. Now I am not inclined to buy pizza there."}
{"text":"Solid NY style pizza joint in Henderson near Anthem on Eastern. Really friendly service. Pizza has great flop, great cheesy flavor and a decent crust. Can be a little on the greasy side sometimes but overall its really good NY style za. Garlic knots are also a must. Mozza sticks are unfortunately not fresh and not the greatest. Go for the pizza. Solid 4 stars"}
{"text":"It was my second time eating here and it was just as great as the first time. If you want some real NY pizza this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in Joey's.  I called to have two pizzas delivered.  Not only did it take forever, I called back to request red pepper flakes and Parmesan cheese.  The deliverer had neither.  The pizza was very expensive and it was very poor quality.  I have been to New York many times and this was nothing like New York Pizza.  I would not order here again."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was delicious! Hit the spot for my weekly cheat meal! Thank you, we definitely will return"}
{"text":"Best NY style pizza I have had since I moved to Henderson /Vegas area. I have tried several others and only Joey's gets a consistent rate of awesomeness. The dough is great and you get that nice crisp on the bottom and don't forget the best part.... The greasey layer on the top when it comes out. Only good pizza is foldable, and Joey's pizza is doing a fantastic job with their pies. Friendly staff. Great food... And always a spot in the parking lot available so far. Only downside is I can't get here enough."}
{"text":"Amazing New York style pizza (coming from a Jersey girl). I ordered several pizzas for a party. They not only arrived a few minutes early, not crazy early which wouldn't be good eirher--just a couple of minutes before my order time which is perfect, but they were also delicious & good sized slices for the price. I Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent , foldable NY pizza . The wings and garlic knots are delicious. Great cheesecake, too. This place is the best ! I love this place !"}
{"text":"I am a native New Yorker and I always have a pleasant time when visiting Joey's NY Pizza. The staff is very friendly and the service is great. Joey, the owner, is a great guy and the food is always fresh and delicious. Today I called minutes before closing (I didn't know they were about to close) and they still had a whole pie prepared for me and waited for me to drive up from Inspirada. That earned my loyalty even more!"}
{"text":"New owners! I was driving at 8pm and noticed they were open so I stopped in to find out they now have regular hours. The old owners kind of opened at random. Anyway, I bought a 2 slices lunch special. The staff was super friendly and we found out the have brick ovens! Pizza was good and crispy. I am now back on Day 2 for another lunch special. They also deliver. Glad to have them in the area."}
{"text":"After trying several pizza places, I've found my go to spot. My husband and I are from NJ, and missed the East coast style pizza so much, and after having Joey's he brings it home. From the pizzas to the cannolis, hands down the best in the area."}
{"text":"Pizza is great here. But I went there Saturday night at 8:05 to buy a few slices and they say oh we are sold out of individual slices, so I say no problem, I will order a medium pizza. Then the girl says we are actually closed... door says 9:00pm. So I left and went to Blaze pizza, not sure why you would be closing at 8:00pm on one of the busiest nights of the week, but none of the staff offered any additional assistance. Probably wont be back which is unfortunate because the food is good like I mentioned. Looks like the staff if eager to get out early on the weekend."}
{"text":"My 3 year old is the biggest pizza snob you will ever meet. And he loves Joey's. I come at least once a week for his afternoon snack and it's like 5 bucks for 2 slices of cheese and a water/can of soda. Every Friday, my husband picks up a couple boxes of pizza. A little on the pricey side, but it's definitely worth it. Over the generic chain pizza...and my boy always looks forward to it!  The owner and I believe his brother are really nice. It can get busy during dinner time so you might have to call a couple times, if there's no answer. I did get attitude from a teenage girl who works there (once) but she's a teenager, I suppose, so whatever. That doesn't deter me from the pizza!  Restaurant is clean, small, and worth the drive to anthem if you're looking for NY style pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Ummmmm for the record the people rating this pizza have no facts backing their claim. This pizza is by far in the top 3 pizza joints in Vegas. I know pizza. The crust is perfect, sauce is not to sweet cheese is 100% real and covers the pizza well. The whole pizza is a winner on top of great cust service. If you want good pizza in henderson go to joeys, Do not take these foo gasies for experts and see for yourself. -Anthony Valentino"}
{"text":"Damned if the owner doesn't still owe me an apology, but the pizza is good."}
{"text":"Omg....Joey's NY pizza just opened in North summerlin.....I happened upon it right next door to NY Chinese on west lake mead...another very yummy real deal hole in the wall with a sister store on horizon ridge hywy.....anyways....joeys is the real deal....the family is from Brooklyn and long island and I had eggplant and sausage stromboli with extra garlic..... just over 10 bucks when I threw in a 1 buck tip for the very nice counter clerk....they even have spomoni flavored ice cream and 3 buck cannolis!  They cater and deliver....actually, I've gone back there a couple of times and they have been closed...now there is a banner over the door, so I hope they are getting ready to be open more often!  Excellent food, nice people.  Not gluten free, sad to say."}
{"text":"So far I've just had pizza here. I've came twice and picked up a pepperoni garlic pizza and it was just like eating it from New York. Its slightly greasy, cheesy yummy. I wish they were closer to our house so that they could deliver."}
{"text":"Pizza Is below average, over priced and service is terrible.  They gave me the wrong pizza and when I called they said I needed to come back in 30 minutes and when I showed up they said it would be 10 more minutes longer and it ended up being 20 minutes. They tried to put their mistake on me and said they were busy.  No apologies, Joey was just put out  that I wanted the pizza I ordered and paid for."}
{"text":"Good pizza .. the employees have no experience of customer service. And they very very slow"}
{"text":"I made a large order over the phone for pick up. I was told it will be ready in 25 minutes. When we arrived they kept telling us 5 more minutes and it ended up being another 20 minutes. (Missed a lot of the VGK game) Because of this they threw in 10 free garlic knots.. well all 20 of the knots were burnt! The 15 zepolles were undercooked. when we bit into them, you can taste and see nothing but raw dough. (While there, a man asked another person how to make zepolles.... seriously?... so this was probably why) So disappointed! on a good note... the pizza was good"}
{"text":"I'm a Jersey girl and I love good pizza. This is fabulous pizza.  They often courteous delivery.  My favorite pizza in the valley."}
{"text":"My husband, a New Yorker, and I ate here for dinner tonight. At this point we expect to be disappointed with each pizza place we try. Either the dough is too thick, the sauce too sweet, or the cheese doesn't seem to melt quite right. Well, I'm happy to report that we LOVED our pepperoni pizza at Joey's! Everything about it was delicious from the first bite to the last. Can't recommend it highly enough. If you like real NY pizza, this is your place. And no matter how full you are, don't skip out without trying the cannoli. Heaven, seriously, they are pure heavenly bliss!"}

{"text":"I always order Joey's Pizza it's delicious! This was my first time ordering online and it worked out great!"}
{"text":"At last... we finally have a REAL New York style pizza place. Thin, crunchy crust, light on the sauce. YUM!"}
{"text":"First time for Joeys. Pizza was great. Fresh tasting ingredients and the hand made crust was delicious. Went in to pick up and had to wait quite a while for the pie, but it was Friday night. Actually enjoyed the interaction between Joey and his regular customers while I waited. Prices are reasonable and the pie was very reminiscent of NY. We will definitely go back."}
