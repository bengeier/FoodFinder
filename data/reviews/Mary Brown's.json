{"text":"Never again.   The service is poor.   I ordered a 3 piece  meal.  I got a drum, a wing and a back.   what a rip off.  Next time I am going to KFC."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Mary Browns and my comparison was Popeye's. I ordered two sandwiches, the big Mary and the mini Mary. The first was hearty and filling and the second was good for a nice snack. I enjoyed the chicken with its minimalistic grease and plump flavour. The toppings could use some work but overall I was satisfied with the food. The customer service was really good as well with the young lady at the cashier being friendly and informative towards a first - timer.  Will return to try other things !"}
{"text":"The chicken is better than kfc and taters and coleslaw are pretty good too The management ,however,seems to be too stressed and maybe would benefit from getting a sense of humour installed. The service is what you expect from a fast food minimum wage staff"}
{"text":"The food was great, staff are friendly and the service was fast and amazing, we've been there 3 times in past two weeks, we had the chicken sandwich meals, each time has been great.  Store was clean each time."}
{"text":"We are regular customer at this erin mills branch. I must say the food is always hot and fresh. 
Non greasy and never soggy. 
Big mary is top on the list with crispy fried chicken. 
Owners of this location is really nice and treat customers very well."}
{"text":"We ordered the 9 piece chicken combo with gravy, taters and coleslaw. the chicken is undoubtedly one of the best I have tried, almost as good as home made fried chicken! The chicken is without skin so it doesn't have extra oil and doesn't leave one feeling heavy or drowsy. Easy on the stomach though I found it to be a bit on then pricey end compared to others.
The gravy is ok, nothing too special and the \"spicy\" chicken is recommended as even that's pretty low on the spice scale :)
This location is halal."}
{"text":"As far as I'm concerned, Mary Brown's is easily first place for fast food fried chicken in Canada- in fact, others such as KFC don't even deserve to share the podium.

I can't even count how many times I've ordered from Mary Brown's (including some other locations) and it's a positive experience the overwhelming majority of the time, so they have great quality control across the board.

I find the chicken is meatier, better quality and somehow less greasy tasting - though it's obviously deep fried. Their batter and seasonings are wonderful and the spicy option does in fact carry some good heat to it. Almost every time I've been around someone trying it for the for time, they'll mention how good it is. I also suspect they do a great job of ensuring their oil is changed regularly, as you never have that extra smokey taste, and dark look on the meat that you may get at some places, such as at Popeye's on off days.

The taters are so good that it's often the thing people mention about the right away. A million times better than a regular fry option at other fast food places, and still enjoyable even if they've cooled down a little. Nice gravy too.

This location has great service, and from my experience, the owner is usually present. It's great not only for quality control, but a handful of times when I ordered a large amount (20+ pieces) for an event, he was willing to provide a special discount. I can't guarantee you'll have that experience, but it has been mine at least. Regardless, you should come away happy with the service you have at this place."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Mary Brown's and this location maintains my esteem of the chain.

It is more expensive than KFC and Popeye's - but you get what you pay for. The chicken is, for me, noticeably better quality with it being meatier and less gristle-ly. Even the skin is crispier which probably speaks to better quality oil and cooking temperatures - and I'm not sure how a couple other reviewers find it bland. Virtually all the sides are better than their rivals too. I don't even know how you could compare their taters to KFC's fries.

It would be nice if they had more promotions, and not simply one coupon at a time on their website (which is often just for stuff like wings), but it's not a deal breaker for me.

They keep the place clean and the place was recently renovated. The owners are often present which ensures quality control too."}
{"text":"DELIVERY REVIEW:

Mary Brown's is pretty good! Chicken always cooked beautifully, so tender and juicy. The sides are also very nice, French fries are nicely seasoned.

The only notes id give is that it feels spiced down, I would of imagined the chicken to be so much for flavorful from the breading but it turned out to be much toned down and simple. 

I got mine to go, however it wasn't as great as the packing goes, very little ventilation makes the good softened to the texture.

Gravy was nice, and the sauces it came with was also good.

I definately recccomend Mary Brown's to any late night casual feast! and the prices are terrific!"}
{"text":"A friend has been raving about Mary Brown's  fried chicken for quite some time, finally got a chance to see what all the hub bub is all about. 

The place was clean and bright with a few tables and some bar stools; service was friendly. They marinate their chicken, coat it then fry it up in canola oil. 

We ordered the following:
-Maple Chili Wings (you can actually ask them to use any of their sauces to coat the wings) - sticky sweet, they were ok. 
-3 Piece chicken with taters (potato wedges) came out piping hot, juicy with crispy edges. 

Better than KFC but not better than Popeye's."}
{"text":"Unfortunately hit and miss. Optimally, it's a nice change from KFC or Popeye's but the majority of my 8 or so visits over the years have been subpar. When it's not been at its best, the chicken was either greasy or stale. Get it fresh and cooked right and it's not bad. But that's the problem. The Queen/Kennedy location in Brampton seems to be poorly managed which could well be the cause of the problems."}
{"text":"Tried this place for a quick snack , exorbitant prices n low quality , not even close to Popeyes or KFC.
Long term sustainability need value n quality which this place lacks"}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here, per certificate inside restaurant. Had the \"BigMary\" sandwich which was very good (better than Popeye's chicken sandwich).  Also had the tater (potato wedge) poutine which was also very good.  The maple chili wings were the best.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Better than KFC or Popeyes which I'd give 1 star to.  Their chicken sandwich is what I would choose out of any fast food type chain, so I guess thats OK.  My little brother really likes it so I find myself here more often I guess..  Kennedy location in Brampton is good and busy so lots of fresh chicken."}
{"text":"Okay y'all...before you judge the picture with no food in it whatsoever, just know this is how good the place was smh. Everyone has to go here asap!! This was my first time here so I expected a lot cuz I heard from my friend that it was really really good. IT lived up to the hype! The only downfall is that it's just a bit pricy, but worth it. Really good quality chicken that's not so oily and greasy like other places and yo..they bring the food TO YOU. You just order and sit down, this some VIP treatment. Great customer service and there's a good amount of room to eat in if you are. The sides you can get are fries or tators (which are like potatoe wedges).. my bad again on having a picture after the food was gone lol just to let y'all know how good it was"}
{"text":"Let me first start out by saying that the reason I gave this place two stars is for the fact that even though the food had absolutely no flavour in it it was fresh.

I ordered an 18 piece Chicken meal that included gravy, coleslaw and fries. The chicken itself was fresh but lacked in the taste department. I got spicy but they seemed to have left out the \"spice\"?

Coleslaw was very similar to KFC and the gravy was the cheapest most disgusting gravy I've ever tasted. I could have made a better gravy out of Clubhouse Insta.

Fries were okay, nothing special. I paid $47 for the meal but tasted like it should have not costed more than $20.

Ingredients are very bottom shelf. If you prefer bland foods though this could be your spot. I do have to mention that whilst I didn't enjoy it it definitely wasn't greasy with a tremendous amount of oil.

I understand this is a Canadian chain but add more flavours and maybe not be so cheap on your ingredients and then you could get better reviews. 


What's makes you so different from KFC. Just a copycat in my opinion. Why would people come to your chain when they could get the same caliber of food at KFC?. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food, real chicken, great customer service. Food is fresh. This is my go to chicken place.  I'm never disappointed here. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The staff here are very friendly, the food is prepared fresh and tastes great. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since my go-to Mary Brown's closed down on Queen! This place was a little hard to find given there's no real sign and the building looks more like a bank. But it's literally the only building on this side of the Britannia and Erin mills intersection. Lots and lots of parking for some reason. Anyway, the chicken was pretty good, and came quickly. Not as fresh as I'd had previously, but I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich was great however I would pass on the fries next time. That's the best customer service I've ever received at a fast food restaurant. I was actually offered condiments before leaving, thanked for stopping by and the woman who waited on me walked around the counter to hand deliver my food to me. I would come back solely on how nice the people are."}
{"text":"Visited this place because the Mexican food place we were going to was having a Christmas party.....and I am glad we did.  Chicken was tasty and not greasy, and the made in house taters were delicious.  Super friendly service was also a plus."}
{"text":"So so so good. Better than Popeyes. Highly recommend. Clean atmosphere, good staff, delicious chicken. Do yourself a favor and go."}
{"text":"I like the Mary Brown's franchise and the lack of grease in their chicken but the taters are the star! This location was my go-to in Brampton until the owner went on vacation. Food and service are amazing unless younger staff are at the front who don't run the kitchen well and have poor customer service skills. Two recent visits included cold chicken, not spicy chicken when ordered, paltry quantities, and a looong delay. It is frustrating to watch multiple other orders precede yours and just be told \"it's coming\" - it better be since I paid for it - while the staff socialize with friends who showed up unexpectedly. Priorities. The paying customer comes first. I still visit this location but now I leave depending on the person at the counter."}
{"text":"I actually preferred their smaller location in old Streetsville. The food for me here is meh. Just your typical cookie cutter fried chicken joint that definitely lacks the wow factor."}
{"text":"Firstly, this location is Halal!! And for that i give it an extra star. This also made me try the restaurant, and it was pretty good. The sandwich and chicken pieces are just as good as Popeyes, and better than KFC. The chicken does not drip of grease and oil. The servers are friendly and nice to chat with. They also let you know about any upcoming promotions."}
{"text":"Pretty weak fried chicken imo the potatoe wedges were pretty bland as well. I heard that this place has really good fried chicken  but to me it did not have the wow factor not flavourful enough it needed lots of hot sauce. The chicken we got was a bit soggy on the bottom not worth the money for me. Popeyes is still number one. If you want pretty good fried chicken and potatoe wedges similar to this place but better value I suggest Truscott bakery for 12 bucks including tax you can get a big box of potatoe wegdes with 6 pieces of fried chicken and its flavourful and here 4 pieces of chicken small potatoe wedges and baby sized coleslaw for 15 bucks with tax is crazy. Coleslaw was pretty good though"}
