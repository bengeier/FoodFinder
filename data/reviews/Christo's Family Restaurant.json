{"text":"They are working hard to get the food back to where it was. It has been excellent the last three weeks. As far as service, we always go with the same waitress because she took the time to be friendly and know us but there are some other great waitresses there. Don't let the couple that may work there from deterring you from trying again. Maybe if business will come back to them they will do that upgrade someone else mentioned in a comment."}
{"text":"place is a little dingy but the food is good, greeks know how to cook. dude who owns or runs the joint never ever ever never smiles, which lends to the overall entertaining experience. you get what you pay for and sometimes more. if the place was clean and the service was professional and the food was the same, the bill would be double. i love the joint for what it is. good tasting garbage food with a sassy staff, AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Incredibly low sanitation grade. Bathrooms were so dirty my family was afraid to wash their hands in there.  Food was SLOWWWWWWWWWWWW coming out and was mediocre and that is a compliment. Will never ever ever darken the door of this place again. Don't waste your time and money. The favorable reviews restaurant must be a fluke when they may have been having a good night, as rare as they seem."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. Its an older restaurant but their food is outstanding! Their wings, hot, medium or mild are out of this world good but warning: they are addictive and unless you drink tobasco from the bottle, I suggest mild or medium!  Pizzas are beautiful, delicious and should be on the cover of a food magazine! Everything on the menu is outstanding! Someone said the manager never smiles.... Not much but he runs a tight ship because he wants only the best for his customers. All in all, its a great place to eat. You cant go wrong at Christos!"}
{"text":"If you want quality good with great people serving you, come here!
The pizza is fresh and hot.
The wings are great too."}
{"text":"The best thing I like about Christos is the variety on the menu. I had Hibachi steak and shrimp and it was comparable to what I would get at a Chinese restaurant. My wife had a pasta plate and the serving size was plentiful, although she wanted more meat in it. As for service, it was a busy Friday night and our waitress seemed impatient and overwhelmed, spread too thin, not giving the best service. Menu was a little pricey but acceptable for this type of restaurant. It's a place I would go to occasionally, when we can't decide what to eat out, as there's something for just about every taste."}
{"text":"There lunches are good, Buffet A-OK. Dinner I will rate 4 Stars nice choices good portions and you can take your tea with you . Don't worry you'll want to it's great. Guss is a excellent chief but all he will say is Hello and good bye. You will love everyone there they make you feel like family. Thanks to everyone at Christo's in Concord. THE FOOD DUDE."}
{"text":"I had wings and a hot sub from here. The wings were decent. They are good sized, not the mini wings a lot of places sell now. The sub was a different story. I got a large Italian Supreme grinder and it had plenty of lettuce but hardly any meat. There were maybe 3 paper thin slices of meat and I was so disappointed I ended up throwing it away. I would have their wings again but I'll never order another sandwich from them."}
{"text":"I just saw tonight that this restaurant just received one of the lowest scores by the Cabarrus County Health Department for this month. (04/13/2016)  I said in my previous review that this place was terrible and now I have some validation.  I don't know what the people giving this place good reviews would consider poor quality but if you haven't had your taste buds burned off by accidentally ingesting hydrochloric acid, you would know to steer clear of this joint."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place. My dad absolutely loved their turkey and gravy dinner. Within the last year or so, everything has gone down hill. Quality of food, atmosphere and the wait time to get your meal has exceeded 30-45 min when it wasn't even half full of patrons."}
{"text":"A family-owned place with an extensive menu-- if you can't find something to eat here, you're too high-maintenance!  Pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, home-cooking... lots of choices.  They have fewer Greek selections than I expected (owned by a Greek family) but what they do have is good.  My husband loves their barbecue wings and will add a couple of those to almost any order.  I crave the Greek side-salad and get it almost every time I go.  They have a buffet several nights a week (pizza, chicken and sides) but I've never tried that-- I prefer trying something off of the menu and so far I've had good luck with my choices.  I believe the desserts are homemade, including the baklava... yum!"}
{"text":"First and last time at this \"restaurant \" . I have never had a Ruben sandwich with literally one slice of corned beef. To top it off, there was a long hair in my sandwich. The rest of the family were also disappointed with their orders.STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"So we went back to try the buffet. Worst mistake ever. It was like they were trying to clean out their fridge. We waited forever to order our drinks and still didn't get an order. We asked about the buffet and the waitress was like huh what? Then we go to the \"buffet\" and our waitress asks what we want to drink as we arr getting food at the buffet. 2 sweet teas and a water. She brings 2 waters and a sweet tea. My husband said one of the waters was supposed to be tea. She had the excuse her dyslexia interfered. When we were paying a waitress came up and was paying for own family's meal and said only 3 people ate but another waitress said I saw all 4 eating. Not to mention the same employee that only paid for 3 people kept going and sitting with her family and boyfriend and completely ignored her tables. While waiting to pay we had to let the other ladies finish their conversation before we could pay. The only good thing about today was the ranch dressing."}
{"text":"Great menu. Tasty food. No issues with time or service. Will definitely be back. Pizza was great. Wings were some of the best. Tons of items on the menu, something for everyone."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch one day because it was close to my house. i really wasn't impressed honestly i wasn't sure what kind of restaurant this is even is , diner? maybe? so with a huge sign out front saying \"WINGS & PIZZA\" i ordered a wings and pizza. the pizza came with corn on it ? and the wings sauce was marinara sauce not buffalo or any kind of wing sauce you would think?   the place inside looks like it hasn't been remodeled since the 70's the service was excellent but until they remodel this place and change up there menu i really don't see myself going here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I have never seen such a dirty restaurant in all my life. Grease everywhere! If you like lots of choices of mediocre food, this is your place. Lots of frozen food. I can guarantee the desserts are not homemade. I doubt anything is homemade here. Chicken wings were all dried out, pizza had a limp crust with bitter sauce and no flavor. Everything else we have had is thrown in the deep fryer. There are much better places in Concord to eat."}
{"text":"Nice family-style restaurant.

Food is decent, nothing spectacular, but pretty good, over all.  Daily specials are very reasonably priced, and portions are very adequate.

Service is prompt and friendly.

Will be back to try more of their fare."}
{"text":"We order from here at least once a week and everything has been really good. The fried chicken tenders were huge and appear to be breaded in the restaurant. Very good! Wings and pizza of course are great as well!"}
{"text":"This place really does offer about any food item you'd like to order!  The prices are much less than you'd expect and the portions are much larger than you get at other places. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the food tastes great!  Hubby wants to try the Sunday $10.95 buffet one of these days. :)"}
{"text":"Is Christo's the place to go when you want a gourmet meal? Heck no. Is Christo's a great choice when you need a quick meal, and you and your dining companions simply cannot agree on a choice of cuisine? Hell yes.

Christo's is a no-frills, home cooking type of restaurant. The interior probably hasn't been updated since the 80s, but that somehow adds to the charm. Did I mention the massive menu yet? It's huge! Do you want spanikopita with a side of fried okra? You got it! Having trouble deciding between a gyro and chicken fried steak? Have both! Christo's is all about options. Some things on this menu taste better than others, but you can order almost literally anything you want."}
{"text":"I love Christo's and have been a frequent customer from day one. The place is a little dated but once you see the menu and all they offer you will forget the decor. 

The menu is extensive and they offer everything from classic greek dishes to down-home southern dishes. Being a fan of chicken wings is one of the reasons I frequent this establishment. Once a month Christo's has a customer appreciation night with all you can eat wings & pizza. 

The owner is like the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld and he can be found constantly yelling which gives the restaurant its atmosphere. You may be disappointed with the decor but the food is yummy and reasonably priced. If comfort food is what floats your boat, Christo's is your place.

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I only eat two things at Christo's, Pizza and Wings, for me I have found none better! Well maybe I lied just a little, the Lemon Cake is pretty damn good as well!"}
{"text":"I finally visited this place after it was recommended to me. The folks recommending said they spend a lot of time there and that the menu is some of everything so I figured why not? I visited around 9pm on a Saturday night and the place was dead - we were literally the only table there. The interior is quite dated, but still clean. It reminds me of having dinner at someone's grandma's house. The menu is quite diverse with everything from wings to pepper steak to fried chicken to Greek. I had the pepper steak over rice which was okay. Reminded me of home cooking and it came out quick. This is the type of place I'd go if I needed comfort food, but not for a date. I'm sure I'll go back and try something else eventually but not as a frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Wow I was blown away this place is greatthe food is real real good. I had flounder stuffed with crab meat wow  one of the best I have ever had! My date enjoyed wings and fish also excellent!!! And it was reasonable priced great fried squash and real good mashed potatoes  I highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go for comfort food. We had a party of 6 dine here for lunch and two members got the friend chicken combo with wings, one got the roasted turkey meal. With the exception of the mac and cheese being super greasy--they all thought the food met their expectations and left feeling pleased. 

Three of us ordered salads and they just were not good. The salad was simply a bowl of iceburg lettuce with one chunk of cucumber, one slice of tomato and some onion. I personally ordered shrimp on mine, and was incredibly grossed out by the fact that the shrimp was not de-veined. I feel like whenever shrimp is served in a restaurant, the shrimp should be cleaned.

The service was okay, it took a while to get our drinks and orders taken. The waitress seemed overwhelmed by her tables."}
{"text":"The turkey was bland with little salt. Thank God. Open face turkey sandwhiches are not supposed to be spicy concoctions of cumen and bleach. I have been to too many restaurants that try to jazx up classic dishes only to fail. Christos has got it down. Thanks."}
{"text":"Come and check out our new and improved menu!! Great things in the works! New Facebook page Christos of Concord!"}
{"text":"Wait can be pretty long after ordering, even when there's hardly any customers. But that's my only complaint. The people are nice and the food is good."}
{"text":"Great Food!!!!  BBQ dipped fried chicken and some if the best wings ever! We will be back."}
