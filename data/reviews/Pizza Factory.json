{"text":"Pizza is decent but not worth the money they charge. For the smallest pizza I paid close to 20 dollars. It is way overpriced and I even mentioned it to the girl at the cashier and she agreed. The service was terrible and it took almost 30 mins to get our pizza. And to top it off nobody was even in the restaurant at the time. Maybe they think cause its Southern Highlands people will pay inflated prices. I will not be going back and will just continue to order from Pizza Hut across the street for half the price. Believe me if the pizza taste good I would certainly pay a little more, but the pizza they serve at Pizza Factory does not justify their ridiculous prices. I give them 6 months."}
{"text":"Brand new store so the bad service was due more to everyone learning than anything else.

Ordered the large BBQ chicken pizza and it was not worth the $25 at all. Even for an expensive town the prices are steep. 

The sauce was good but the dough/crust were shit. Reminded of old school 90s Domionos.  Not worth it, go to Grimaldis on Eastern."}
{"text":"I wish I could put zeros instead because their service is just horrible and the pizza isn't even that great. Their prices are not worth the quality of their food."}
{"text":"This pizza is absolutely fantastic. 
Our first time here. Decided to stop when my husband was done at the barber shop next door. And I'm sooo glad we did. 
The pizza and antipasti was amazing!!! 
And we're from Chicago so we KNOW good pizza when we see it. 
We will definitely be back!!!!"}
{"text":"THIS IS NOT REAL PIZZA.  Don't give them money. 

To much regret, I gave Pizza Factory roughly 24$ for two large 2 topping 'pizzas' as they call them. I brought them in to my car, and without opening them, I knew something was wrong. It didn't even smell like pizza.  To my dismay, when I opened the boxes I saw two overly fluffy discs of dough, a thick gloppy layer of sauce and cheese and some toppings. The 'crust' was soft and flavorless and the sauce was overly sweet and had phony 'Italian' seasonings. 

I can't figure out what kind of businessmen would want to enter this crowded space of crappy pizza restaurant. This is barely on par with Dominoes or Pizza Hut and I might even be able to find better offerings at one of those two. This is expensive real estate. It's a big space in a pretty good neighborhood. God, how we long for some decent pizza here in Southern Highlands. 8th Ave is the closest we get to an actual pizzeria and it only barely makes it. I hope this venture fails, and it will, but I really do, and that's a pretty horrible thing to say. These people deserve to lose money for calling their product pizza."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of negative reviews that may scare you away but don't let the haters keep you from enjoying some great pizza buffet. No line, great price, and you won't have to fight snot nosed kids while you wonder where the hell their parents are.. I really like this place for what it is. Is it gourmet pizza? No but it's definitely better than any other chain in town."}
{"text":"Where do I begin! Let's just say I will not be returning to this establishment. The owner of this place has the worst attitude and terrible customer service. Very unfriendly and not appreciative of the customers who come in and basically support this establishment. Take some customer service skills and be much nicer. Didn't appreciate his bad attitude. Will not return and will mention this to all my fiends and family."}
{"text":"I love the pizza.....  Hand tossed 
The toppings I had appeared fresh
Sauce is good
Different sizes

Didn't care for the wings but the pizza is good!!!!"}
{"text":"A little pricy but great pizza. Totally worth every penny, I loved not just the food but the environment. It was fun and the service was great! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Ordered pizzA to go but I guess every one gets there pizza first. Bad customer service. I just got a Bbq chic piza and garlic bread , I wish I was white so o can get better service. 20 years in the food and beverage dept. I see the people that hand toss the pizza moving and grabbing money and etc. I think your suppose to wash your hands after you touch money or other things. But oh well .. I do need to get thinner. Oh diarrhea here we come."}
{"text":"Ordered pastrami pizza because of picture from previous review but mine seems burnt. I printed out a free bread sticks coupon from here. When I called, she confirmed three times if I already had the coupon printed and she instructed me to make sure I hand it to the driver. When driver arrived, no bread sticks."}
{"text":"This is a good family pizza place!  The prices are a little spendy, but the food is really good and it is a very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've had better frozen pizza! This place seems to do decent business, but the pizza was soggy and the toppings almost seemed like they were tossed on at the end of being baked.  The cheese and sauce was bland.  I would not suggest buying a pizza here.  The place was clean and the people friendly, but get pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Buckeye!!!
Hand tossed, great sauce!!
Very good selection of beer on tap!!"}
{"text":"Place is a joke. Won't give me a reason why they won't place an order for me. Maybe the one time they didn't want to honor my coupon. I will be calling their corporate or franchise office. Don't see why they wouldn't try to keep customers."}
{"text":"Celebrated our daughters 10th birthday here last night. The staff was very accommodating to all the children. The pizza was great. I am thankful there is a restaurant in SoHi for kids parties. They even have a party special. All the kids played video games, ate and hung out while the parents pretty much did the same thing. I guess beer and wine will be back on the menu soon. Thank you Pizza Factory!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this Pizza place, at first they were very friendly and I really liked the Pizza, then I called and got the can you hold??? Well she laid the phone down and processed to chat away with someone, she picked up the phone about 10 minutes later and took my order. Waited the 20 minutes then drove down... Pizza wasn't ready and had to wait plus deal with the \"attitude\". Last visit, I like supporting local businesses but there is too much competition providing better products at a better price so I am no longer a Customer"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have eaten here quite a few times over the last 4 months. At first it was fantastic and I raved about it to friends. We've been more and more disappointed over the last 3 times we went to the point that, with today's order, we will no longer go there. Their calzones have gotten smaller and smaller each time we order. And this time they put so much Parmesan in my calzone that it's completely inedible. I'm so disappointed because this place used to be so good."}
{"text":"Little mom and pop place with good prices and delicious pizza! My family comes here quite often and we have never had any complaints about service, plus the food is always great! Conveniently located less then ten minutes from Verrado."}
{"text":"This place is no good.  Ordered food and it was never made. Complained to the staff and they said the meal would be ready in 5 minutes.  Food still never came.  Had to ask for a refund and left. The restaurant us a mess.  Pass on this place."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ordered 2 customer calzones from here last night and I honestly wish we had just ordered dominos. 

We first tried to do our order online and the system wouldn't recognize our address for delivery and kept saying to pick from a suggested address though there were no suggested addresses coming up. Ended up calling in the order. My fiancé tells the girl what we would like and she proceeds to tell him that they can't put meatballs in the calzones. He tells her it is on the website and she yells to the manager who just yells back that of course they can. Once we got past the meatballs, he told her our address, and then had to repeat it 5 or 6 times for her to understand, he spelled it, said, said one letter at a time. But this girl just couldn't seem to get it. We gave our payment info and she said okay and bye. No estimated time of delivery, nothing. 

We figured it wouldn't take too long. Simple order and we live a whole 3 miles from the store. Nope. We call them after an hour and get told our order is JUST leaving the store and will be there in 10 minutes. I knew it would be more than 10 minutes but whatever. 30 minutes later it finally shows up.

My fiancé's calzone was dripping in grease so much that the crust was soggy and the box was too. Mine was the same, but I at least had the paper liner that kept the box from almost falling apart. Both were barely warm, were dripping in grease and were coated in a thick layer of congealed cheese that was disgusting. The inside had so much sauce it was like soup was pouring out once you cut or bit into it. The veggies and meats were drowned in sauce and tasted flavorless and were almost impossible to decipher what was what. 

Overall this place was kind of a joke. When you are contemplating ordering another pizza from a different shop after three bites, you know you will never be going back to that place again."}
{"text":"Always great pizza , we love this place.Hand tossed, bread sticks are amazing!! Always clean and cold beer"}
{"text":"Used to love this pizza but it is just not good anymore.  The pizza seems over cooked lately and less flavorful.  I had one slice and decided it wasn't very good.  As for the wings, yuck!  I watched the owner take them from a bag of wings (Tyson) you get at Fry's.  He put them through the pizza oven and when they went through, he put them back through one more time and served it.  No wing sauce, no celery sticks and just plain wings.  Yuck!  Husband tried one and hated it.  Time to go back to Argento's."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok but the customer service is the worst.  The owners are usually always there and rude when serving or taking orders.  I should have probably learned my lesson but I keep going back and the attitude is always same or even worse."}
{"text":"that's some of the best pizza i've had since i've been in vegas keep up the good work don't change anything"}
{"text":"So I'm trying to use this coupon for the twisted stix advertised on yelp- but Noraz is telling me that just because I paid for it already he can't give me the stix and grumbling to me about it.  - my point is not about the stupid stix - it's the way he said it in a grumbling way( we live in the neighborhood and it's our first time here and thought we'd patronize this business) he said then he'd have to refund my money and then re ring me up -.. He made it seem like such a hassle and that he'd lose his job and he can't lose his job.  I said it's about customer satisfaction .. Which obviously he doesn't know about.  The other 2 boys were really nice.  I asked for a manager and he wouldn't give me the name or number of the manager.. Really???  Pizza Hut across the street is a much better pizza, nicer customer service and knows the name of their manager ..."}
{"text":"My husband & I ordered the BBQ chicken sub & wings last night & it was the best tasting sub that I have had in a long time. My husband says the same thing about the chicken wings & loved them more for not being friend, but baked. I don't know why the other reviews are posting negative remarks about the place, we found the opposite to be true. Very clean with great service & very busy with customers. We will be regular customers. :)"}
{"text":"This place is great!  They accommodated our very large basketball program with delicious from scratch food.  Amazing breadsticks, the boys gobbled up the pizza, parents loved the pasta and the service was excellent with such a huge group.  Good mid-week specials!  This place deserves better ratings!  Love it!"}
{"text":"I was a bit afraid to come here because of the ratings, but pizza was needed for dinner. Turns out that there is new management/ownership and it was great!  We were greeted upon entry. The manager was very accommodating, explained the menu, very helpful. The toppings, OMG, they were very generous with them. It is too bad that this place is so far away from home and office.  I will make some special trips over there to get the meat pizza for sure! Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Just had the most disgusting cold pizza slice and salad I've ever had.  Foam bowls and foam plates.  Pizza slice was yesterday's and wasn't even hot. It was cold.  Not going back."}
{"text":"We visited on June 6 for the AYCE dinner buffet.  I didn't feel the store was too busy.  There were 2 families and us 2 but within a few mins. they were completely out of pizza so we had to wait about 10-12 mins for new batches.  There was no potato wedges as advertised on the sign.  I witnessed the female cashier take a pizza out of the oven but the metal piece it sat on fell to the floor so she used the tongs to pick it up then proceeds to use the same tongs without washing them to touch the pizza.  She saw me watch this but just smiled.  Later on I saw the cashier refilling the table cheese containers.  She took the jar and scooped it in the larger container, this without her washing her hands from cashiering and also having the table jar now contaminate the bulk container.  I don't think the Health Dept. would approve.  Ok onto the salad bar.  The lettuce was in poor shape, wilted, brown and soggy.  The cashier brought out more lettuce to refill it while the tongs were in the middle so after pouring the new lettuce in she had to find the buried tongs. Oh and that lettuce wasn't much better.  We really wanted to like this place since it's only 5 mins. from our home but left very disappointed and felt over charged by our experience.  I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Good pizza.  Reminds me of Round Table Pizza in California.  One stupid rule is they want coupon from mobile website to be printed.  Save a tree already.  What's importance is printed vs seeing on a smartphone."}
{"text":"I am very fussy about pizza. To me, this is the best local pizza besides Mr Scribs which sadly went out of business. There is massive amounts of cheese and something magical about the texture of the crust. Now, listen up...don't skip the piece of garlic French bread covered in mozzarella! It's AMAZING.  So, just when you think you've found the Holy Grail you get the garlic twist breadsticks!  I have NO WORDS.  You simply have to experience. Owner keeps a immaculately clean restaurant. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wish the atmosphere was a little friendlier but the new location is a huge step up. Much cleaner and with a few dining room changes this could actually be a nice hangout spot for nearby residents. I do wish they'd lose the plastic beer mugs."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!!  Made sure when we called they were given specific directions to get to our home... apparently didn't listen for they even called twice on the way...still tolerated them being late...but....they screwed up our order!!! Delivered wrong hoagie, plus was very soggy...gyro was cold also! Called them to let them know...and they treated us like we didn't matter that they got our order wrong and it was so cold plus hung up on us!? We were first time customers!!! REALLY!?! Don't order from these people!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately Southern Highlands got another below average pizza place. We will continue to pick up Grimaldis or delivery from Rosati's. The dough was so tough and the pepperoni had no flavor. It just tasted like cardboard. We got a meal deal with breadsticks that were inedible, wings that had good flavor but we're really soggy, and we added on an antipasto salad that was okay. Granted part of our experience could have been because the delivery person couldn't find our house and our food got to us over an hour after we ordered it."}
{"text":"Pizza is okay. Better than Cicis or Pizza Hut, but definitely not hole in the wall, mom and pop Italian good. 

Showed up and was ignored by cashier and owner for 6 minutes while they dealt with another customer who had been given the wrong change. After that got sorted out, I finally got to order a meatball pizza but the cashier told me they didn't have it.

After carefully explaining that I wanted a cheese pizza with meatballs as a topping, she finally got it. Then I ordered a kids Mac and cheese, which was not as advertised.

They brought out a bowl which tasted fine and the kid liked it, but it was 1/3 the size of the picture. They also didn't have the kids cookie that was advertised.

Luckily, the traveling manager that was there to help the store for the grand opening and he made it all good. After apologizing profusely, he explained that there were some growing pains they were experiencing and that the cashier was on her second day. Then he gave me a free pizza card. Good guy who went out of his way to make things right. 

I'll definitely give them a second chance, probably for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"For a new pizza place in the area, it was dead on Saturday night - that should have been an indication to walk away.  But, I wanted to give it a try and the cashier was super friendly.  I ordered take out and it took 40 minutes for them to prepare a small (10\") 'All Meat' pizza and an order of ravioli.  Money would have been better spent on DiGiorno and Chef Boyardee, and the preparation time would have been quicker.  Although it was packed with meat, it was probably one of the greasiest pizzas I've ever had.  The middle of the pizza should be reserved for those with cast-iron stomachs and a handful of Tums.  The ravioli were stuck together and the sauce was borderline pure tomato paste; very thick.  Ravioli were poor in taste and texture.  I think they were covered in the same sauce as used use on the pizza, but with meat added.  Speaking of the meat, that was the only thumbs-up I can say about the place, the meatball used on the pizza was pretty good.  Not cheesy and bready, and I believe it was the same meat added to the ravioli sauce.  I'd love to get my money back for this meal, but I will never step foot in the establishment again.  I can't imagine they get a lot of return customers.  I give it 90 days and that store should be closed.  Since it's Las Vegas, I'll make a bet on it."}
{"text":"Great pizza at an affordable price! 
Service was amazing and very clean premises.  I will definitely return!!! :D"}
{"text":"So we were very excited when we heard Pizza Factory was coming to Vegas and even more excited when we heard it would be in our neighborhood! We have been disappointed. The menu is nothing like the original Pizza Factories. The prices are quite high. We ordered a small pizza (6) slices) and it was $14.00. We ended up spending over $30 and it was for two people. Miss the breadsticks and salad bar that are at the \"real\" Pizza Factories."}
{"text":"So we decide to give this place a try, giving it was only 2 mins from our house! We went with the chicken Alfredo. I have to say the pasta was a little bland, it definitely could have used more flavor. It's wasn't the worst pasta I've had just can't say it was good. And it was a little over priced for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have to give a 2-star review to 5-star tasting pizza because the owner is rude and has no customer service skills at all! I am so angry that a place that serves such delicious pizza is run by a man with a nasty attitude that does not know how to appreciate his customers. 

A word to the wise for the owner: Have your wife or son take care of the front of house and please stay in the back, away from customers. You are going to end up out of business and it will be your own fault. The pizza is hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten but I would rather gag down some frozen pizza than to be treated like garbage by someone who is making money off of me. Without us (your customers) you do not have a business! Remember that and adjust your attitude accordingly or you will be out of business and flipping burgers in short order!"}
{"text":"They do green olives which is the greatest since not many local pizza places do. :) Good service. Good pizza. Good prices. Satisfied."}
{"text":"Never been there before so I thought I'd try it.  All the employees seemed to be very nice however the place was dead on a Saturday evening.  I looked at the menu and instantly new why.  $19.00 bucks for a medium pizza?  So I just thanked the girl at the counter and went on my merry way."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5, but I always round up in their favor.... Very clean restaurant with friendly employees. The lady at the front said they are under new ownership so I must give them time to get situated. The pizza was your standard Pizza Hut/dominoes type of pizza, nothing special but definitely not awful by any means. The salad bar was the best part. I did come late in the evening so the salad bar could have been freshened up in my opinion but I know they won't be with closing shorty. They had many great options to chose from, with some amazing ranch - not that hidden valley crap!! I will try them again!"}
{"text":"First time here. I asked the lady at the register how this works, she told me about the pizza buffet and what it came with. I told her 2 adults and 2 children. She did not inform me that it is the same price for children. Mine are 4 and 5 and hardly eat anything, but I paid $7.99 for each of them. She never told me about the kids special. The place was filthy and the silverware and plates looked like they were not even sanitized or washed. Pizza was so so. Def. will not be back."}
{"text":"This place is under new management, and it's run by a bunch of idiots. We ordered $60 worth of over priced food, waited almost an hour, only to find out that these morons had not put our order in. When I asked for a refund they said that only the manager knew how to do this, and she couldn't be reached. Stay as far away from this place as you can."}
{"text":"Not a good first impression at, went in ordered a large pepperoni and cheese sticks nothing complicated, sat there for an hour or more waiting when not a lot of people were even there, the girl told me it'll be done in 2min ....... 45min later I got my pizza. I honestly think they either forgot or lost my ticket cause that was too long for a simple large!! 

On the pizza note def not that good too much sauce and doh was eh, wife and I totally made a better pizza with fresh and easy dough. 

Garlic bread sticks were eh nothing fancy.. 

Prices are way too high for this quality of pizza.

Probably won't give them another chance, sorry guys for the 1 star just being honest, step up your pizza game this is southern highlands !"}
{"text":"Where do I start......Let me start by telling you how disappointed I was after eating here!! I had really high hopes and was super excited there was a location near me. After trying the Phelan location in CA (after huge recommendations from my BF) I fell in love with their pizza. It was the BEST pizza I have ever tasted...I'm not a huge fan of pizza, but they made me a fan for sure. The ingredients were so FRESH and REALLY YUMMY!!!! The staff was super friendly too, made you feel welcomed.....TOTAL OPPOSITE experience at the Buckeye location however. The staff that only consisted of 3 people were EXTRMELY RUDE! They defiantly did not want to be there AT ALL. The food took FOREVER to get out to us and when it did it was hot and looked great......Looks can be deceiving though.....as I lifted up a slice ALL the ingredients just slipped right off.....The cheese  was rubbery, the sauce tasted store bought and the chicken tasted frozen. I LOVE ranch with my pizza and the Phelan location has some of the BEST ranch I've ever had so I said to myself, \"at least the ranch will be good\" HAHAHAHA!!! The ranch was literally Hidden Valley. WHAT A JOKE!!  There is just so much wrong with this location and should be closed down ASAP...They are tarnishing the Pizza Factory name!! It's funny because my Daughter and I got a \"bad vibe\" as soon as we walked in and now I know why."}
{"text":"Their pizza is ok..., nothing that wows me..., and you better 'wow' me if i'm going to pay  alot $$$ for your pizza.
The pizza dough is good, and cheese ok, what was dissapointing is that I could barely taste or see the sauce, that is the heart of the pizza; also, dissapointing is that the veggie pizza I ordered was displayed very poorly, the bell pepers we're cut into small bits (they need to take note on how to display their pizza by their own marketing photos). Costco may have to give them a few pointers on taste, if they listen.
I live in the Buckeye area, but, have tried Pizza Factory twice before because it was convenient at the time to stop by there, and this may be my last time.
A few other concerns I have noticed on prior visits, is the lack of customers in the restaurant, which may be because of poor friendliness, twice before I have seen the lack of enthusiasm in there, and I felt the vibe that it was an inconvenience to serve me. I don't like to see owners/employees occupy tables (tables for paying customers) with thier keys, drinks, laptops, as their desks. Only one TV , today, most places have many TV's, and it is not that important to me, but, I know many folks whom appreciate them. Also, they have a big coke refrigerator, and no product, tells me they don't anticipate volome. And, the counter, via the salad bar feels sticky, not sure why (clean counters and bathrooms are key).
I don't wish Buckeye entrepreneurs ill fate, but, I really want to see thier company succeed. A great pizza, Barros, is 20miles away, and I will generally make the effort to go out there to get my 'wow' pizza, and, why their success, because of great tasting pizza, great cutomer service, and great price points."}
{"text":"I came all the way from California to eat at this location. Delicious pizza, Allison is very sweet. Super clean store. I recommend for anyone craving a beautiful looking pizza."}
{"text":"2 months new to the neighborhood. And tired of your usual commercial pizza. Figured I'd try something different and pay the price. Delivery. Specifically made it a point for them to bring red pepper and parmesan cheese 3 times over the phone.  Yes I'm spoiled.. But it's a simple task. For a Friday evening my large Diamond Back was delivered in 40 minutes or less.. Great job. But guess what? . No red pepper or parmesan cheese.. Anyhow. $29.00 for the pizza.. And a $5.00 tip for the super nice girl who new nothing about the extras.. You would think they would keep some In there car. Guess not. Not her fault. I'm in the service industry business.. And I know us locals is what makes your living. Bottom line. I'll never order from this joint again. Horrible communication leads to horrible service. Good luck pizza man."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, wings are nasty.. won't be ordering from here again as I like wings with my pizza, the wings tasted like the frozen wings from Costco"}
{"text":"love this place!!!!!! even though i moved out of buckeye i still make it out there for thier bread twists and pizza!!!!! 

try thier bread twist.... amazing!!!! the owners are sweethearts. also they have coupons on their website!"}
{"text":"Got their pizza last night for the first time. It was actually really good! Def one of the best pizzas in the area. Will forsure be coming back for more."}
{"text":"five five.... FIVE.

i love love this place, although admittedly it has some nostalgia to its credit, but thats not the reason you can find me eating there once a week. I've eaten at 4 different pizza factory's in my travels (2 in CA, 1 in WA) but this is by far my favorite! its a little on the smaller side but its worth it. My husband eats lots of other things there, sandwich's & pizza and likes it to. I bring everyone here, out of towner's & in towner's and they are always pleased. The owner and his family are on staff and they are always nice. Please stop by and let everyone know how tasty this place is and Be sure to try the garlic beadsticks... delicious. oh and did i mention i travel 15mins from goodyear for this place. i think its that worth it."}
{"text":"Update- been there a few times now. Still a friendly and welcome addition to the neighborhood but just wish the pizza was better. I originally I gave them 5 stars but turns out that was a bit generous. The pizza is just slightly above average. Nice place and great staff though."}
{"text":"Fresh and easy is better. Hell, pizza hut is better. And I think that says a lot.  Service was good, prices did seem high. Was provided a great quantity of the toppings I ordered, but just not great crust or sauce, and it was hot and freshly made. Salad bar didn't look impressive, which is a huge disappointment, as I'd love to find a decent one other than whole paycheck foods."}
{"text":"Pizza was good....customer service was horrible. Owner was crass, discourteous, and down right rude. He failed to honor their on line prices at all, or even meet a customer halfway. I was told \"that's the price if you don't like it don't order it next time!\" over a 1.50 discrepancy! He told me over the phone to type in a different website, which I did and was redirected to the same one I was looking at. I was treated so poorly, and with such disrespect I will never set foot in their again. Also the wings tasted as they were seasoned, frozen, shipped, then popped into their easy bake pizza over! Dry and nasty!

Their secret ingredient is definitely not love, more like Bile and hate! I just love how the box they use says be buddies not bullies and the owner bullies any and all patrons."}
{"text":"Once we walked in we were greeted by a gentleman and he suggested the all you can eat buffet he was very kind and the pizza came out quickly. Elizabeth was very nice to us, she came out to check on us and reassure the pizza was good and our expectations were met which they were. She made us her specialty buffalo chicken pizza which I believe should be on the menu it was so good!!!! My daughter, girlfriend and I enjoyed this place very much and will be returning."}
{"text":"Southern Highlands has limited options and I am happy Pizza Factory has arrived. I had my first visit this past week and didn't experience any of the negative items in previous reviews. Regarding the service, I thought the service was great. We ordered a pizza to take out so I had to wait about 15 minutes (which seems reasonable to me). I had a toddler with me and the employees brought me crayons and paper to color on. They were even accommodating when I added something to the order after I had already closed it my bill. 

As for the food, I think the pizza was really good. Ordered a Hawaiian with thick crust. It wasn't a greasy buttery pizza like you will get at other joints near Southern Highlands. I appreciate this because I didn't need to daub the pizza with napkins to soak up the excess oil. Personally, I think pizza is dough, sauce toppings and cheese!  Anything more than that and it's a heart attack on a plate. 

Check them out."}
{"text":"For starters I love the pizza here , but what kills it is the staff , the managers are so rude , they don't smile and they never ask you if you need anything else , they just want you to leave , I asked for cheese and pepper for a large pizza and they gave me 3 packets , it's so disappointing to know that they don't appreciate the customers here ."}
{"text":"This place wasnt terrible. Sometimes to me, pizza is pizza. As long as its not thin dry and flimsy. We went because there was a promotion on facebook for the bogo pizza buffet. So once we got there it was minimal but for $8 it was fine to me. The salad bar wasnt that appetizing and there was only 1 kind of soup. So you basically get what you paid for. But back to the pizza... it tasted great as long as it was fresh. Some of the pizza we got was sitting out for a little bit but was still very hot, just looked and felt older. I would eat the pizza again if i ever had plans to go back. The staff was friendly. Only thing i didnt really like was the cashier wanted to charge me for 2 buffets and when i mentioned the bogo she asked how i heard about it, and said its one of those things you have to mention to get the deal.. but it didnt even say that on the post that made us come in. But nonetheless she had no problem giving us the discount when i told her it was from facebook. since we came basically last minute without even realizing it, we and whoever else was eating the buffet also got to take home the pizza that wasnt ate in a box. That was really nice in my opinion instead of letting all that pizza go to waste. I would give it another chance if there were more varitey in the salad bar, different soup.. and extra sweets maybe? Fresh garlic knots too. Mine were so hard i couldnt even break it apart."}
{"text":"My husband and I along with a couple went late Tuesday night to have some pizza.  We ordered their large pizza combo.  This combo came with bread sticks, pizza and beverage.  It was reasonably priced.  Pizza Factory is located in a shopping strip that like many shopping centers has been affected by our economy.....there are two other tenants in this location.  We arrived 10 minutes before they closed and he still invited us in.

We ordered the combo pizza, bread sticks, cheese sticks, wings and all the fixings that come with it.  Everything WAS GREAT.  The pizza was EXCELLENT and his service was top notch!  

We will definately be BACK!!!

{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy this place. The food is always great and the staff strives to do everything the right way. They have changed a lot of the staff for the better so be patient with them. They have always been accommodating to anything that we have needed!!"}
{"text":"HAHAHHAHAH WOAH!! Im stunned right now...literally stunned. My daughter and I walked in to this dark hole of a place and there were only 3 tables with patrons and yet we stood at the counter and NO-ONE greeted us. After what seemed like long minutes we decided to ring the bell...yes we had to ring the bell. Get this...after we rang the bell a guy gets up from the table to the left of the counter whom we thought was a customer. He comes around the counter and just stared at us as we stood there looking at eachother speechless. I said to him \"I wondered if anyone was working\" and he replies \"thats what the bell is for\". My daughter said \"we shouldnt have to ring the bell\" and he looked disgustingly offended by her words and just looked through her. At that exact moment I said \"this is awkward\" and I kid you not he says \"its not awkward for me\" and then yells across the restaurant to someone that an order is up and then a man from a different table gets up and comes around the counter to make our pizza.  YES....you are picturing this correctly...BOTH these guys knew we walked in and both ignored us and let us stand up at the counter to ring the bell.  Thats 2 out of 3 tables...only one other table were actual customers. We should have left but we were 60 miles from home and starving. This was the most uncomfortable experience I have ever had with an establishment. Hey! DONT DROP A DOLLAR HERE.....THEY DON'T APPRECIATE THE CUSTOMERS...DONT HELP PAY THEIR BILLS!  I felt it appropriate to leave our trash on the table .....it was only fitting for the environment! AKA...Money laundering operation????? Because who doesnt care about every customer that walks in their door?"}
{"text":"I am not a picky eater, and I don't need 5-star service, so I wouldn't normally rate a restaurant this low. But I am struggling to find any kind of redeeming reason to eat here again. We've tried it twice, and it has been bad both times. It's ridiculously expensive for what you get, the service is lousy, the wait times are atrocious (even in a completely empty restaurant), and the food is nothing to write home about. I can't understand why it takes them so long to acknowledge the incoming customer, service the table, or prepare/serve the food. Unless a lot of things change, I don't see how this place can remain in business."}
{"text":"I went here while on vacation visiting my friend. Neither of us had been there before, but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast, so we gave it a try. 

The staff was totally rude. Before we went, we called to check the hours. The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information. 

The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special. If you're going to have mediocre food, you better have exceptional service. Double fail."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, but not a write home about and it is steep in price for everything there. The place is definitely a \"To-Go\" place. Atmosphere is horrible, big plain box, no music, TVs muted, just odd feeling. seems like they are telling you to go without just asking you to order and go. Clutter branching out to the tables from the back room. Cannot figure if just not unpacked or if there is a storage issue. I thought maybe because it was newer the service was off, but after four in-dining tries, it was confirmed service is just off and the staff with a couple exceptions seem irritated to be there and irritated you are there."}
{"text":"FYI - new management just took this over. 

With that being said, I would like to talk in depth about the management and how much they care. Had a personal conversation with the manager about how this place started off rocky and they'd like to fix it. This store is all about community out reach and families. I fully enjoyed about how they do specials for students, teachers, parties, and the school district. As someone who works with children they give free tours and free pizza coupons to the kids to show them behind the scenes in pizza making. They showed me such coupons they can make, for example student of the month, perfect attendance, happy birthday, Etc. 

While there I tried the AYCE salad bar, which was very fresh. I loved the spinach, romaine, carrots, bacon crumbles, broccoli, tomatoes and mushrooms. The potato salad and fresh fruit is a nice touch. Can't beat that for 7.95.

During the week they have a lunch special of pizza salad and drink for 7.95. 

My daughter was impressed with their pizza. She's huge on pepperoni and they didn't skimp out on the toppings. I personally thought there was too much pepperoni but she called me crazy. 
I loved the dough. It was very cool to see them tossing in the air the fresh dough for the next pizzas. 

They deliver which is quick and easy. You can even order online. They have specials if you buy in bulk which is perfect for parties or my staff meetings. 

Only suggestion is to see the staff smile more but I know they were stressing with 15 people in the building and still training. I def will be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Friendly staff.  Their Hawaiian pizza is really good.  Monday through Friday lunch buffet is $7.95 and lots of food.  Come check it out."}
{"text":"We were welcomed even at the last 35 min of their lunch special, and they brought out fresh cooked pizza, friendly staff JJ was helpful, 7.99 AYCE of pizza, salad and drink"}
{"text":"I really love there pizza, wings are pretty good too, prices are a bit high I thought but I like it so I buy it. I haven't ever gone to eat there we usually just call and pick up. Once I placed an order over the phone and my husband went to pick it up and after a while I got a call from a man calling me back from Pizza factory, he said \"I'm calling about the pizza you ordered\" and I said \"yeah?\" And he said \"are ya comin' !\" In a very sarcastic /rude tone.  I immediately called my husband worried because we only live about 5min away so I thought something could have happened and my husband answers and tells me that there is a small crowd outside the place because the door is locked.
Apperantly he went to the restroom and forgot to unlock the door.
I get it, it can happen to anyone but there is no need to be sarcastic to a paying customer!"}
{"text":"I have mix reviews with this place. My dining experience was great overall the staff was very nice , the food was great, we got the all meats and veggie pizza. The delivery experience not so well the pizza was all over the place , super greasy, there was more toppings on one side then the other. For $45 dollars I expect more!"}
{"text":"We received a flyer for Pizza Factory a few weeks back. The menu was large, and included appetizers, salads, pasta, pizza, wedges, strombolis, calzones, gyros, wraps, burgers, hoagies, wings, and even dessert. For anyone who has ever tried Pizza Marsala, Pizza Factory is almost identical in quality and variety, however I noticed that PF's prices are an average of $1-2 cheaper, per menu item.

We ended up ordering a medium Tuscany chicken pizza (about 8 slices), which has grilled chicken, tomato, green olives, roasted red peppers, spinach, artichoke hearts, provolone, mozzarella, and ranch sauce. We also ordered broccoli puffs and breaded mushrooms. I was told approx. 30 min for the wait. Exactly a half hour later, our order arrived. The pizza was neatly made and I was surprised by how good the green olives were on this particular pizza. The dough was soft and fresh, with a slight crunch, and we also requested an order of bread sticks, which my husband particularly liked. They were brushed with oil, garlic powder, and cheese. 

The sides were great as well. I liked the broccoli puffs over the breaded mushrooms, although both were tasty. I've had broccoli puffs in the past where bacon bits are included, but PF's are just broccoli and cheese, which I prefer. I thought the breading on the mushrooms could have been better, but they were piping hot and we were given a generous amount. Total came to $28, before tip. My only gripe would be that I ordered chicken on only half of the pizza, but seemed to taste some on every slice. Our delivery man was friendly, polite, and efficient. Don't forget to mention the free bread sticks for orders over $20! I'm looking forward to ordering from here again, soon."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to get pizza! So much cheese....the way a pizza should be. Breadstick are amazing as well. If you are looking for a cheap cardboard pizza then look elsewhere. This is buttery breadsticks and extreme flavored pizza! They can get busier on Friday nights but the wait is always worth it!"}
{"text":"First time we've had pizza from here. I got the Greek and my son got a pepperoni. Really good! Everything looked and tasted fresh. Prices are a tad high, but you really do get what you pay for. We will eat here again. 
Only one small negative remark - the staff really didn't look too pleased to be there. They weren't rude in any way, just unhappy looking. That did not effect the food - it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I eat here a lot they put plenty of pepperoni. The staff is very friendly it's a kid friendly environment"}
{"text":"This place makes GREAT pizza.  Staff is always friendly and welcoming.  Establishment is clean and never fails.  Excellent place for a great pizza dining experience."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would! 

The place could have some real good potential. It's clean, homey, and not far from where I live. However, we weren't greeted coming in the door. Not a big deal, I could care less. What I do care about is the flavor of the pizza... There isn't any. Everything comes out of a can. Literally everything. I got the lunch special, very great price there... Includes drink, slice of pizza and the salad bar. The salad bar was a joke. No cheese, no onion, and the lettuce was definitely the bottom of the barrel pickings. I left this place seriously angry. And yet again, no thanks for coming from the worker.

Forgot to mention...hope you enjoy eating off of paper plates."}
{"text":"Pizza was very average, I guess my expectations were a little high maybe. I usually eat gramaldi pizza which is 5 star, but this was close to the house so I gave it a try. Another super expensive fast food place in southern highlands. It's gotta be the rent that is driving these food prices out the building. We ordered a small pizza and a mini and it came out to 28.00 dollars with 2 drinks! I have spent 40 bucks on a pizza at the aria hotel but it was very high quality and taste. I wish I could say the same about this place."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to write.  My family started eating here when they first opened. We were a once a week customer. Very happy with the food and service, pizza is delicious. 
Then one evening, we placed our order asking for the special we always get, a 2 pizza deal.
When we received our order, they placed 2 medium pizzas on our table. I immediately asked about the pizza size as we had always received 2 large pizzas as advertised.  It turns out they have 2 specials, a 2 medium pizza deal and a 2 large pizza deal.
The employee never asked which deal and the fact that we were there with 5 people should have prompted them to ask me to specify which deal.
I spoke to the owner of this location he agreed to make us another medium pizza to make up the size difference to which I agreed to.
Nearly 10 minutes later, the owner came to our table and told us that if he made us another pizza, he was going to have to charge us for it.
I refused and now nearly 2 years later, we have chosen not to return to this establishment. 
My money is important to me and it should be as important to any business, especially a small local business...
I now choose a place slightly further away, but one that appreciates its customers.
Pizza - delicious
Customer appreciation - needs improvement
Hope some changes have been made over the last couple of years"}
{"text":"False prices on website. Owner treats customers with disrespect and the greatest disdain. He actually yelled at me in front of other customers  and my friends for politely pointing out pricing discrepancies! Food was greasy and nasty called corporate they apologized citing it is a franchise location but still send me a letter of apology and a $30 dolled coupon, not that I would EVER return. At least corp. made an effort."}
{"text":"It's bad. Really bad I tell yah. They put a Big Mac in my pizza when I clearly asked for a whopper. I am beyond infuriated and will not be going back for more. Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"We came here today at 12 to try their lunch buffet - first time. The guy working was super nice and asked if there were any fresh pies we'd like for him to make. We requested a buffalo chicken pizza and he whipped it up for us - so good! The other pizza we tried was good as well, just seemed to have sat maybe a little too long under the hot lights. Fresh is the key here because when it is, it is great, when it's not it's good not great. The salad bar was fresh and plentiful and had really good croutons! It's AYCE salad, pizza, breadsticks, and includes soda for only $7.95. That's pretty good to me!! We'll most likely be back."}
{"text":"At first the owner did not want to bother with honoring yelps check in coupon, but when I got to the Buckeye location he honored it and then told me to go to Buckeye.pizzafactory.com for his coupons. Pizza is always great here and I am just happy customer servise worked out."}
{"text":"We attempted to try pizza factory tonight (11/26 at about 10 after 7pm). There was not a single person in the restaurant, when we walked in we were not greeted so  I asked the woman behind the counter if we seat ourselves. She responded that we could sit anywhere. We took a seat and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. No one came to bring menus, take our order or even acknowledge we were even in the restroom. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Unfortunate because we live in the area and we're looking forward to trying a new pizza joint. We decided to try the other pizza place in Southern Highlands that we had not been to and had great food and service at 8th Avenue Pizza.

I am not sure we will be back to give pizza factory a try considering our horrible experience. Maybe the management should explain to their employees what customer service is."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious! We typically order pepperoni & salami. It has never disappointed. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I only give them a three because the food in this town is so bad. However, there were two Pizza factory's back home in WA and they were both really good. So, I paid almost $25 for a pizza here. I asked them when I called if it was the same as all the other ones. They said yes...I explained that just because they stated didn't mean it was true and that Pizza Hut and Domino's here were awful.That being said, you would think they would try to do well.

The toppings were very scarce and the cheese more scarce then the toppings. I am seriously only giving it three stars, it deserves two, because I am so tired of giving negative reviews.

I am doing them all tonight because I am fed up. I am going to learn how to make everything myself. I am a good cook but it's a lot of effort. And part of the problem is that living in Buckeye, AZ you can't even get a decent grocery store...."}
{"text":"The pizza was okay. The Service sucks and the restaurant is very cheap. The pizza is very greasy. The chicken Alfredo is bland. Isn't not a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Pizza was way over priced for the quality. The crust tasted stale with no flavor. Our cardboard and ketchup pie had barely any cheese. Overall dry and not worth going. Next time I'll pick up a $5 pizza from 7-11"}
{"text":"This place sucks! The last 5 or 6 times we've gone they've messed up our orders. So 2 weeks ago I decided to call and make a complaint. So the manager that night says he'll put my name down for a free pizza and order of breadsticks. I call tonight trying to place that order and the manager was a complete jerk & was beyond rude. So I asked to talk to the owner he gets on the phone and was worse than the manager! He told me he was busy didn't have time for this and hung up on me. Needless to say we will not be going back here."}
{"text":"This was our second time ordering pizza from here while visiting Show Low. We remembered liking it and last night, we liked it again. The pizza was great. Nice thick crusts. We had the veggie and a good ole fashioned cheese.  The gal on the phone was polite. Delivered on time. We will definitely get pizza from here again."}
{"text":"Ever since they change staff and new management took over the place have completely change for the BEST!! Lunch time buffets is great for just under $8 bucks all you can eat and everything is fresh, plus you get a drink!!! Food is good and staff is upbeat. Plus calzones are delicious will go again."}
{"text":"Half - no star if I can give a real rating. Women in the front is rude with a flat attitude, - does not like her job!! No wonder the store was empty... This place will close soon. Pizza was okay, hard to really mess that up, but never will come again . I'm not the first to say this in a review ."}
{"text":"Our first visit here and we we're pretty happy with everything. Had domestic beer on tap with a salad bar and the pizza was really good. The thing I might suggest is to ditch the cheap paper plates and styrofoam salad bowls and up grade to either hard plastic or better disposable dishes. It's nice to find a sit down pizza place with a beer."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic pizza!!!! We've wanted to try this place for awhile and finally did!!! Absolutely amazing! The dough and breadsticks were awesome! Toppings we're top of the line. They have some great deals especially for buffets!!! Lunch buffets and then Monday night buffet. It's delicious! Must try! Very family friendly! Great job Pizza Factory."}
{"text":"I've only had their take out pizza and like it very much. I believe the ingredients are good quality and the toppings are plentiful. When my family visits they always ask for pizza from Pizza Factory."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd attempt at this place. Each experience has progressively gotten worse.

Pizza pretty good on first attempt, but service was poor. Okay, I'll give them 'new' flexibility here.

Next attempt, still extremely poor service, we sat on hold for almost 13 minutes. Tried the calzones - extremely flavorless. Just bland.

Then there's tonight.

Online ordered at 5:50pm, estimated time for pick up was 6:20pm. We set a future order to be ready at 7:00pm so we could run to Smiths and grab a few things first.

We got to Pizza Factory at 6:48, waited a few minutes before going inside at 6:55.... I waited in the car with my 2 school aged kids  (who are in year round school and have class in the morning) and 1 toddler. 7:00 comes and goes, 7:10, 7:15, 7:20.... I finally go inside to check on my husband. It's STILL not ready.

My husband stated that he was skipped over in line by the cashier to pick up the order first of all, and then when asked about the delay he got a response of \"oh, well, we're kinda busy tonight\" - There we 2 families dining in, no one else picking up and the delivery driver was taking orders 1 at a time. - You're not busy. The owner is slumy and running you on minimal staff with poor training.

So my biggest issue is a toddler falling asleep in a car at 7pm means that said toddler will not go to bed until after midnight. Here I am with an overcooked pizza (cheese is hard and crust is gnawed on like a dog bone) and a toddler that will keep me up all night. I have work in the morning. Work required to pay for future pizza orders. So here's to my exhausted under productive day and crabby 16 month old who won't go to sleep until after midnight.

We WILL NOT be going back for a 4th attempt. They've shown me it only gets worse."}
{"text":"Ok, in all fairness, this place has a lot of competition in Southern Highlands, not to mention Pizza Hut is located across the street.  However the pizza here is very good.  Great crust and no sparing on the topping.  I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Ordered a XL Meat Lovers and spaghetti with meatballs. We had a coupon for 3 bucks off an XL pizza but we couldn't print it out. The person taking the order was irritated but said she would accept it anyway. When I got there, I got a lecture, but still said she would accept it. She did not take the 3 bucks off my bill. The spaghetti had no meatballs but the pizza was good. We will never order from them again. They seem more interested in pleasing their accountant than pleasing customers."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such low ratings?!? We love their pizza- their pizza is how all pizza should taste! All the other chain restaurants are full of grease and soggy."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. Rude. Food is nothing like the locations in Cali !"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. The food is always fresh and good, and the staff is awesome. Norais was very kind and very informative of the menu and how they make everything fresh in front of you. I would pick pizza factory of the Pizza Hut across the street any day."}
{"text":"First time ordering here thought I would try it. The pizza was okay and the wings weren't cooked over priced don't recommend ."}
{"text":"Finally a Pizza Factory in Las Vegas!!! It did not disappoint! Ate inside burned my mouth the pizza was so hot! Had a Pastrami Pizza which is the only place I've ever had a Pastrami Pizza from and it was awesome as usual! We got a large one topping pizza and free breadsticks (use the yelp coupon) total was 18.00 and I'm taking some food home so why others are complaining about the price is beyond me! You pay for what you get! Fresh ingredients great flavor and I will be coming back at least once a week! Lunch special is 7.99 for pizza, salad, breadsticks and a drink! This is the only Vegas location but it's worth the drive! I love their pizza and you can't go wrong with this place!!"}
{"text":"Great service from Noraiz!  Check it out for the lunch buffet 7.95 through the week days."}
{"text":"Hands down worst pizza I ever had!!! Pizza Hut across the street is better, and that's not saying much!!!  I threw remainder in the garbage.  Overlooked, bland, soggy.  My kids wouldn't eat it either! Medium pizza, 3 drinks and 1 salad bar, $31!   What a waste of money.  Great concept but this place wil be closed soon.  Why can't we have good food places come to So Highlands??!!  We are left with McD, Subway, China A GoGo or Taco Bell!  Just add a KFC and we will have the bottom of the barrel of the entire food chain.
Pizza Factory, please please make a better pizza!!! Really hate to see you go.
Service was good though."}
{"text":"I went in a bit hesitant due to the reviews they have and well they're not wrong. Nobody was in sight in the shop, then you ding their bill and you get scolded. Truly a sad joke, once we were finally attended which was after 5 minutes, which is weird because there no customers there, we decided to not even give it a chance."}
{"text":"Pizza and pasta were very good. The ladies that were working were very nice. Great experience overall."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza at the counter sat down waiting for it to be prepared, next thing I know some chick runs from out the back and screams are you going to pay for this? I will let your imagination figure out how this went for her!"}
{"text":"Not happy with the chicken Alfredo (no chicken) when we called it was taken care of but still the wrong order. The Alfredo sauce had garlic powder in it not fresh garlic so the sauce was bitter. Although the this place is close to the house don't think we will be going there again. Not a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Placed a lunch order for myself and several others. The chicken fingers were raw in the middle. Not undercooked. Actually raw. The pizza was undercooked. The order was also not correct. When we called to let them know the issues, they said they would come to get the food and replace it. They never came. To mess up an order this badly is one thing. To not make it right is another. To say you're going to make it right, and then not keep your word is even worse. But they went as far as blocking our  phone number, as if we were ever going to order from there again anyway."}
{"text":"Don't know where to begin.
the 3 pizza Factories by my house in CA I rant and rave constantly about it being the BEST PIZZA on earth cause it really is, my GF lives in phoenix and it's a MUST everytime she comes to my house we go to Pizza Factory!
 With that being said OMG we decided to visit the Buckeye location what a mistake I can't believe the corporation lets this place tarnish it's name I swear I would've enjoyed a \"Hot-n-Ready\" over that crap they brought us, 1st walked in nothing but decorLESS walls and the employees there are very nonwelcoming thought I was in WalMart for a min, then the pizza was brought out (Chicken,Bacon, Jalapeno....my go to) the crust was so limp, and the ingrediants tasted rubbery and frozen we didn't even take the leftover pizza home which there was plenty of very dissapointed!!!! Will never visit this location again! Please people if you're ever in the \"High Desert\" area of CA i.e AppleValley, Hesperia, Phelan give them a try you WON'T be sorry."}
{"text":"I have never posted on here. But This place is awful!  Came here with the family for some arcade games and to try the pizza. 
The pizza did not have the ingredients listed on the menu on the pizza. I got a bbq chicken it showed up with sauce cheese and bits of chicken. 
Nothing else. The video games were 50 cents for pac man and the screen continually flips so you can't even play. I will never return."}
{"text":"New ownership or management team seems to have made changes to the sauce and we're very bummed out.  The sauce is more generic tomato bland now.  My kids are actually asking for Domino's next time.  :("}
{"text":"Good pizza. Liked the crust and was loaded with toppings. A little over priced though. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I might even go 3.25 stars here. Tried these guys last night for the first time. They had a big banner out that proclaimed \"Any 12\" Pizza $12.\" 

When I order pizza I want either; 

a. A tasty pie NY style. The closest I've found in the valley have been Grimaldi's and Mama Mia. Thin crust, minimal toppings, yum. 
b. A \"regular\" pizza with lots of toppings. I've been accused of having a salad bar on my pizza. This gets expensive so the offer advertised on the banner was promising. 

So I dropped in and ordered one to go with 3 toppings. Not bad. Medium body crust, mild sauce, not too tart or sweet. Plentiful toppings, cheese nicely browned. Tasty. 

I was disappointed when I realized they are a chain and I immediately had fears of a Peter Piper or Little Ceasar's type of pizza but this was distinctly better."}
{"text":"We lived in Payson and the Pizza Factory there is amazing.  This one is exactly the opposite.  The owners are absolutely rude.  We called and asked to order ahead for dine in because we had two kids with us and were eating after a school concert.  I was told they don't allow phone in dine in orders.  I asked if I could order pick up and just eat there and after a hold time was put on the phone with a manager.  She said if I ordered pick up we could not stay there and eat.  I asked her why and she said because the people that were dining there may have ordered and if we Sat down to eat right after arrival the other diners would be mad.  She said I could order and she would start it when we arrived.  

Every time we have been here they are just rude.   It is a shame because it would be great to have a good pizza place nearby.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Tonight was our second try with this pizza place. Tonight we ordered a large pizza with sausage, pepperoni and olives. It was small for a large, maybe the size of a medium at other places. It was $27 for the smallest large pizza. The sauce is a little bland and they skimped on the olives and pepperoni. The pizza is mediocre at best and for the price I don't think we'll be going back. The first visit we had a mini pizza and a large calzone and it was almost $30...just too expensive."}
{"text":"Believe it or not I do know the difference between Italian sausage and kielbasa.  Disgusting!  It takes a special kind of cook to pull a fast one on the customers like this."}
{"text":"I was a bit hesitant about this place based on some of the 1 star reviews but I was pleasantly surprised. I came here with my husband and toddler for Monday night pizza buffet. We had a coupon and spent less than $10 for all 3 of us. They have numerous pizzas, breadsticks, a good salad bar, soups, and draft and bottled beers. It was quiet and there was no line and no wait. They have several TVs and a few arcades. Overall my family enjoyed this place and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. TERRIBLE SERVICE.  I can handle the fact that these owners have little to no personality.  What I can't handle is BAD SERVICE.  I  get pizza there 2-3 times a month. Not a lot but  not never.  Walked in there tonight with a $5 coupon on got in my email. Coupon did not say you must print out so I preceded to show him the coupon on my phone. He stops me and says I have to have it printed out.  I sarcastically said 'oh I'll run home and get it' he said 'ok'.  I walked towards the door and said ' actually I will not be coming back'.  At that point he said 'I'll take the coupon'.  Well I say which is it?? You either take a coupon or you don't.  Maybe it would be a better idea to make the 'right' decision BEFORE you piss a customer off.  I'm DONE with pizza factory."}
{"text":"Great pizza.   Very good fresh salad.  The staff REALLY needs to work on their people skills.  It take more than good food to make it in the world today.  I really hope they work on it soon  would hate to see them fail they do have great pizza."}
{"text":"I love their pizza. Sometimes inconsistent in quality. But overall delicious. They are friendly. Their customer service is great. I want to try their other menu items. Maybe head next door to DQ for dessert."}
{"text":"Stay away. Most flavor less pizza no one wears glove. This place needs to revamp soon. I order a medium pizza with 3 toppings and some basically sugar sticks not cinna sticks. There is no heart In the food. Everything piled together. It was 23 I gave her 40 n she gAve me back 15. Clearly don't know how to count. End up dumping out the food"}
{"text":"Pizza is hand tossed.  Yah furniture are not plush or comfy, but I hey, I ddint come here to sleep either.  Between those big name pizza place that has that distinctive frozen though taste, I'll go for hand tossed ones."}
{"text":"The owners or their people will cook your pizza any way you like it. Our family (with children) can relax and  the kids play with the games in a separate room. I gave it 5 stars because I really can get a family meal cooked and prepared the way I want it, half made for the kids and half for my wife and I. Their wings are baked not fried, so they are not too greasey. This place is family owned and operated and the dad knows our names and usually has quarters for our kids to play some games. Former U.S. Marines show up each Friday meet, eat, drink and play cards or dominoes. I mention this because two of our kids sit down and the Marines let them play with them. It cracks me up. Oh, the salad bar is pretty good too."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened, I am in the strip mall it's located in at least once a week but the not so great reviews and a friend had said she didn't like it steered me away.
They held a Customer Appreciation day this weekend (last weekend of June) where they were giving away pizzas for just showing them a downloaded coupon they had on Facebook. Perfect opportunity to give them a try. 
We went later in the day, around 6:30, there were other patrons there getting pizzas, but they were not as busy as I thought. They had a wheel to spin for prizes, but you had to fill out a form for their email notifications. 
So the pizza smelled good, it looked pretty average. The free pizza was a medium but seemed small. I was shocked at the price they charge for this size pizza with pepperoni... $14.50, that's outrageous! 
On to the taste, it was very basic, bland dough, cheese, spicy greasy pepperoni, if it didn't have pepperoni on it, it would've been tasteless. I would compare it to a grocery store frozen pizza. If it were cheaper, much cheaper; I would consider going back but its not worth it."}
{"text":"pizza is good and worth the price. chicken is not good. staff arent the friendliest but it only takes 2 minutes to order and then go pick up."}
{"text":"New pizza place. Eaten here two times. Pizza is decent but over priced. The staff is not friendly at all. It was hard to get any information out of the lady. The younger girl is pretty nice. We will not return due to the staff being so bad. I gave the older lady a tip because I'm a nice guy and she didn't even say thank you. Terrible service screw this place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the pizza at this place, but unfortunately the only way I will ever eat there again is if they are under new ownership. The owner who took our order was rude. Instead of bringing me the beer that I ordered, he surfed the Internet and went outside to take a phone call on his cell phone. The salad bar was disgusting. There was barely any lettuce in there, and what was there was brown and old. There was a piece of plastic in my food and when I brought it to the attention of the owner, his response was, \"oh.\" He simply took it off of the table and walked away, not even an apology. He doesn't seem to care for his customers at all. I'm amazed that this place has not gone out of business yet, but I'm sure it will soon enough if things don't change. Horrible, terrible, disgusting, disappointing."}
{"text":"Even with expectations calibrated appropriately for a place like this (think Cici's), it missed the mark.

The lunch buffet suffered from a lack of freshness, rendering the cheese rubbery and the crust impenetrable to knives. Even if it was fresh I don't think it would have been good. The cheese had the same mild sweetness that Pizza Hut cheese does, an unexpected dimension that is literally the only reason I'm giving this place a second star.

Even the steak fries were burnt, like they'd been left in the oven too long. Variety was okay. Favorite part of the meal was going to the gas station next door afterwards and buying a bag of chips. 

Second favorite part of the meal was Jello.

Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The pizza is always delicious! The sauce is very flavorful and the pizza is always served hot! They have unique flavors like pastrami pizza (delicious) and they are generous with their toppings!"}
{"text":"We just tried this place for the first time tonight. I called in an order for pick up and got the large pizza and breadsticks special. The special was a great deal. It was ready when they said it would be, staff was courteous, and they even gave my daughter a frisbee. The pizza and breadsticks tasted great. So, overall a great experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was a little afraid to try this but went for dinner. Salad in salad bar looked low but they refreshed it and the salad bar was great. It looks kinda limited but has everything you need. Ordered 2 pizzas and both came out great. Not cheap but worth a try."}
{"text":"*update, don't waste your time checking in to get the free breadsticks.

Guy taking order was kinda rude about it saying they don't honor it"}
{"text":"So I'm waiting here for my salad. I see the girl preparing it with no gloves on her hands the phone rings she answers it and then puts the order in and goes back to making my salad again with no gloves. I would speak to a manager but to the look of things this is how things are done here"}
{"text":"This place may have good pizza as I've read the reviews but when I walked in and saw the guy making pizza with his bare hands, wiping them on his jeans, and then handling money I was completely turned off.   When I asked if he was going to wash his hands before handling my pizza he became very angry .  I told him to either answer my question or I wasn't going to buy mine he swore at me and told me fine, leave.   So I swore back and left and will never return.   Maybe the pizzas look and taste good but I don't trust that place at all!  Rude Unprofessional Disrectful and most of all Disgusting ."}
{"text":"I hear the staff complaining about being understaffed and threatening to walk. Wow! The pizza better be amazing for $23. I just wanted to check this place out. If the pizza is great, I'll adjust my review."}
{"text":"This place gets worse with each visit and this was the last straw.  I walked in and the place was completely empty, I saw 3 people behind the counter and one of the gentlemen looked right at me and look away...I stood there for another 15 seconds then yelled to get their attention.  I ended up walking out and going somewhere where they recognize the value of a customer.  If the place had been stuffed I'd understand but not one soul was in there.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Best customer service I've seen at a pizza place!  Always friendly and proactive, their thin crust pizza is great."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this business for anything other than maybe pizza.  My wife and I tried this company on Sunday; I ordered a gyro platter and fries, my wife ordered a salad and an order of pepperoni rolls.  What we got left a lot to be desired.

One thing I can say that was a positive was that the driver delivered pretty quickly, and the food was somewhat hot, and the costs were comparable.  But the quantity and quality were not great.

For starters, my gyro platter consisted of processed gyro meat that did not taste fresh.  It was inserted into a pita which was then set inside the container on a bed of shredded lettuce...no tomatoes, no cucumber, no olives...just shredded lettuce.  The fries were plentiful but were like warm.  My wife's salad came in a container about the size of a McDonalds big mac container,, and had 1 (one) slice of cucumber and one cherry tomato.

As for the Pepperoni rolls, there were about 10 in the box, and they were warm, and covered with parmesan cheese and either butter or oil.  But the pepperoni slices inside the rolls were almost paper thin, and each roll had one slice of pepperoni.

I compare this to other restaurants that serve similar foods, who deliver much more for the same prices.  We thought we were trying something new...but we will now stick with what we know."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, the manager/owner couldn't be any nicer. We stopped there two minutes before they closed and wanted breadsticks but they had already turned everything off. They offered to turn it back on but said it would take a 1/2 hour, so we passed. He then offered us free drinks to go. Then tonight we stopped again to dine in and he gave us 10% off.

My wife loves the breadsticks, but I do wish their food had a little more flavor. The pizza had plenty of toppings, though. My daughter had the dinner salad which was very large for $3."}
{"text":"worst pizza and wings. I read all your reviews and tried it anyway. there's no bloody flavor!! looks nice, but I was basically eating bread dipped in ranch, and I never do that to pizza. 
I don't know how they can make it without any taste. like your chewing air. must be science or something. 
you know how to judge a pizza place? if they have a pizza oven or a conveyer belt thing. guess which one this place has. 
wings suck too, I think they bake them. get a fryer.  
try this place just to taste nothing while eating. it's wild and hard to explain. 
Gordon Ramsey would throw salt in your faces and scream about seasoning. haha"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area 7 weeks ago. Went to a Memorial Day BBQ today and the food was unappetizing. Decided to call and order pizza from Pizza Factory as I noticed their NOW OPEN signs on my way to mentioned BBQ. The girl that took my order over the phone could NOT have been sweeter. I was concerned due to the reviews I read. Inside was clean and organized. Salad bar didn't look like it had been neglected. Staff were super friendly. Pizza was good. My teenage son loved it!!! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place despite the reviews. We ordered a small meat pizza and a combo calzone. Our pizza was so good! It was crispy and had enough toppings. 
The calzone was bigger than we thought, my husband tried it and he said it was good. We had to take the calzone home because we were full. 
They also serve beer!

The gentleman that helped us was nice. He made our order from scratch. The place is nice and clean!

We will definitely give this place another visit."}
{"text":"I ordered a wide selection, as I usually do when trying a place for the first time. The gyro was good. The fried shrimp was ok. The fried mushrooms had a very unpleasant taste, I won't be ordering those again. The chicken tenders were good. The pizza was excellent. Garlic bread was very buttery and garlicky lol."}
