{"text":"I really wanted to like Corks.  Great concept, but it just isn't able to pull it off.  The wine list is ok, but just ok -- with a name like \"Corks\" they ought to have some fabulous wines to pour.  But the real problem was that even with more than an hour and a half before performance time next door, they were not able to get our simple dinner order to us.  We had to leave just as the food arrived.  While the waiter didn't admit it, I think he forgot to submit the order -- most tables came in after us, and most of them had their food in normal timeframe.  The drinks were also inconsistent -- my wine was fine, but the other drinks at the table were different from the first round to the second -- they were just not the same drinks (even though the server insisted they were).  We wanted this to be a good pre-show venue, but we'll stick with Bricco across the street."}
{"text":"Very friendly service.  Great food. Amazing selection of wine."}
{"text":"I have frequented this wine bar since it re-opened, I would say approximately 2 years ago.  After the opening and for some months thereafter, the food was not spectacular; yet, the drink selection was adequate.

However, since the bar has acquired new management staff, the food is excellent and the staff is always eager to answer any concerns you may have about its wine offerings.

The bar has a small; yet, decent selection of beer as well as a fairly good selection of wine by the glass or bottle.  Current wine specials may be found on Tuesday & Thursday, particularly on Tuesday with its 2 for $20...a bottle of wine and an appetizer for $20. 

I like this location because it does not have multiple TV screens all blaring on different sports channels, nor is the music so loud that you cannot hear the person seated next to you.  If you desire a quiet drink on Playhouse Square, stop in and be surprised.

Until next time my friends, cheers!"}
{"text":"I hesitated to write this review, because I didn't actually eat or drink anything during my first (and last) trip to Cork's.  Instead, I sat with a friend for 40 minutes before our server apologetically informed us that our order had never been submitted.  Mistakes happen, but for this to have gone unnoticed in a room that was virtually empty upon our arrival is truly stunning.  Any offer of recompense would have kept us from leaving, but since none was forthcoming, we promptly left.  Cork's has evaded a 1-star review by having a decent decor and friendly atmosphere.  After all, there are much more unpleasant places to waste 40 minutes."}
