{"text":"I bought a Dealfind voucher and decided to give this place a try.  I got there at dinner time at 6 pm.  After looking at the menus I told the waitress I have a voucher and ready to order.  She said for people who have vouchers, they get a different menu.  Not just a different menu, but the prices are different too, they are higher compare to the menus I just had.  Other reviews have said they serve big portions, not the dishes we ordered.  They were average sizes at best.  I felt we got cheated somehow showing up with a voucher."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Ate here a lot before I moved. I came here whenever I wanted comfort food. I usually get the egg sandwich or the egg+ham w/ rice. The food was cheap, so I won't complain about the quality. Not saying the quality was bad, just not enough. I haven't had bad experiences there, but a friend of mine said she found a fly in her food and they wouldn't do anything for her. I gotta see it to believe it!"}
{"text":"Always love their satay meal $5.25 that comes with beef noodle, egg sandwich & a drink.  Iced lemon tea is a must with rich tea flavor.  A neighborhood favorite HK style restaurant!"}
{"text":"I was here again tonight to use up another Dealfind voucher.  I have been here several times already.  The restaurant looks almost abandoned from the outside, decor inside is also a bit shabby, but the food and service here is actually very good.

If you are using vouchers you can only choose from a small menu of dinner items.  Today we had the hot plate items : chicken cutlet, fish cutlet, along with rice and hot lemon tea.  Our hot plates were delightful as always - soft meat, onions, with black pepper sauce (which is neither too spicy or too strong).

There are photos of other HK style dishes along the wall and the prices are nice and cheap.  They also sell those thick soft white bread at the front counter which is great for making your own HK french toast at home.

The service here is very good.  Friendly and polite waitress, very helpful and considerate (eventhough she doesn't speak english very well, she tries her best while remaining nice and calm).  Would have liked try regular menu items using the vouchers but unfortunately we were stuck with the higher priced voucher menu items.

Breakfast looks awesome so I cant wait to try it next time."}
{"text":"Mei Chuen has been an institution for fast cheap HK style Chinese restaurant in the Scarborough area.

It is open early 8 AM and close at 9 PM. So you can go there for breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner.

They have special set menu whole day long.. All of them comes with a choice of hot drinks (famous HK style milk tea is a must try, they are still served HK style in a extra thick teacup)

All the food here are ok, portions are big, the price is good and you never go home hungry!

There are daily special written on the board in the front, all written in Chinese, so you have to ask the servers about them.

You have to write your order on the order sheets that are on the table and the wait staffs will check your order and leave you a little receipt on the table. When you are done, just take the receipt to the cashier and paid there...

Not the cleanliess.. so don't be surprise! You know what I mean when you go to the washrooms and see the signs they posted there.. :)

CASH only!"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME for the price. Everything is super cheap and their breakfast is delicious! It's as close as it gets in terms of an authentic Hong Kong cafe. Definitely try the egg sandwich. They make it with this really thick and soft white bread, and the scrambled egg is just perfectly cooked. You could eat there for less than $5 and be super stuffed. I think it's even cheaper than McDonalds (and ten times as delicious)!"}
