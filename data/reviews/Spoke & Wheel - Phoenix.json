{"text":"Bike centric pub with awesome food.  The bar tender was awesome. Great drinks for HH. Burgers were cooked perfectly and lettuce wrapped if you ask. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood venue but needs to work through its kitchen and service issues.  Only open about a week.  Restaurant is nicely updated and inviting.  Back patio is open and lively.  Food was good once you got it.  Our server was great and manager, once he appeared, appropriately apologetic.  Comped a meal and gave us a dessert.  I want them to be successful so we will certainly give them another chance.  So we went the next night with other friends.  Like I said, we really want this restaurant to be successful.  Service was somewhat better, course we had the attention of the manager.  Still got some things to work out...its slow and forgetful.  The food is quite good.  We sat on the patio which is great.  As we were leaving about 8:30 - 3 bus loads of ASU college students were arriving.  OMG!.  They are not prepared for that kind of crowd yet.  I'm sure they had a good time anyway.  I'm upgrading my rating to 4stars.  I've been there 5 times and each time service gets better and better.  Food is always very good. My husband had a pork chop that was heaven on earth.  It's not on the menu any more but ask.  Drinks are now coming quickly and they haven't forgotten anything (ok except for the apples on the apple Gorgonzola salad which was more hysterical than anything) in the last 2 visits.  We live a hop, skip and a jump away so it's becoming \"our place\".   Give it a try."}
{"text":"Loved it!!!! Service was great, food was so good and the desserts were awesome. Can't wait to go back. Yummm seriously a great place."}
{"text":"Spoke and Wheel has consistently great service. A group of friends and I visit regularly and Alex is always amazing, remembering us week to week. The food is delicious and we have been impressed again and again."}
{"text":"We love their burgers. Medium rare. Sooooo juicy and good.  Love this place . Happy hour is great ."}
{"text":"I was so excited for the opening of this restaurant, I was worried I'd be disappointed. I WASN'T.  Upon arriving at the restaurant, we walked into the bar and were told to sit where we liked. I am not usually a patio person, but the weather was nice so we gave it a shot.  The prior business' patio never did much for me, but the patio was clean with big wooden tables and bicycle themed decor. I also noticed a projector and screen which would be great for watching boxing on a spring night. The music was great, mellow rock and I ordered a Fat Tire which was nice and ice cold. We ordered the homemade chips & guacamole for HH. They were tasty. Side salads with chicken...the tomatoes were so fresh and tasty. Service, atmosphere and food were all great. Can't wait to get back for a full meal and some sports."}
{"text":"Great service and happy hour.  $5 drinks and some cheaps apps. Guacamole was great, street tacos decent.  Good vibe, not too crowded.  Though lots of flies outside, not sure what they can do about that if anything.  Aaron the manager made sure our table was taken care of and clearly trying ti make this place a succuess."}
{"text":"This was my first time venturing to the Sunnyslope area for dinner, and Spoke & Wheel was a great reason to do so. The happy hour prices are fantastic - $5 sangria that is full of flavor and plenty of booze, $5 pitchers of local beer, and great food options to boot. The regular dinner prices are also good, and the food was all around pretty tasty. The fish and chips are crazy delicious - literally some of the best I've had - but the chicken, biscuits, and macaroni and cheese were lacking in the same sort of scrumptious-ness. The chicken suffered from what I detected was an improper breading process, so the coating fell off quickly and grew soggy as well. The macaroni and cheese was made with cheese that coated my palate in a weird way, though it was seasoned properly unlike the chicken. The biscuits, however, were fluffy and delicious. Overall the food for the table was so tasty it still deserves 4 stars!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. It's a burger and beer joint. My wife loves the Mud Garden Mule and I get the local beer that's on tap. During happy hour a small pitcher if beer is $5. Can't beat that. Everyone that works there is great and we keep coming back even though we live over 5 miles away. Worth the trip"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food is outstanding. Chicken and biscuits is a must have. Great drinks and a good rest stop on a weekend bike ride."}
{"text":"Such a great place to eat! The workers are so kind and make you feel welcome. The place is not too loud and is very comfortable. My family and I got the street tacos and they are some of the best we've ever had. For dessert we got the peach cobbler. Wow, I really mean wow. That is the best peach cobbler I have ever had. I would definitely come back as much as possible. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by in the afternoon to catch the food and drink happy hour which starts at 2. I decided on being adventurous and based on the recommendation from Kate I ordered the mussels. She told the cook to put a side of vodka sauce so I could dip my toast and mussels in this delicious sauce I'm glad she did because that combo was out of this world! This is the second time I stopped in and have had great service both times. Truly a gem in the valley. Also bicycle friendly and get happy hour if you ride your bike."}
{"text":"Happened to yelp and see what was close to Sunnyslope HS after my daughters dance recital and this came up. We stopped in and had lunch and were pleasantly surprised. The beer selection was good and ice cold. The food was also tasty. We will definitely be back. Next time we will ride our bikes cause then you get Happy Hour prices for the entire time that you are there. Can't beat that! Plus a lil exercise. It's a win win.   I would put Spoke & Wheel on your list of a place to stop by. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of all the wild thyme restaurants and when I found out they were opening this new spot I got so excited! From the moment I walked in I felt at home! The owners and chef  that also work at the other spots all greeted me and welcomed me right in! We ordered the guacamole it was delicious! I had some cocktails that were definitely on point!:) the wings were pretty awesome also! Definitely will be back frequently! I love the new place! Probably my personal favorite out of the wild thyme chain.:) they are new so don't mind all these bad reviews! It's not a bad place at all! Go try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great beer selection. Especially when they have the grapefruit sculpin! Oh, and the servers are awesome! Especially Alexis!"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. Literally the worst. After seeing all the good reviews I am convinced there is an integrity problem with Yelp. If I had not been with a group of friends I would have gotten up and left. It started with them being out of the beers (plural) we wanted to try. Then tried ordering a fruity drink and out of fruit. The food came out at different times and we had to keep asking for our sides and other stuff and get up to find our server. We were the only people in the place. I understand why. The service was so unforgivable we will never be back. My bad review will probably not show up sadly.   UPDATE: The owner or manager did respond to my review very professionally and offered a gift certificate to give them the opportunity to wow us. Unfortunately while I appreciate this appropriate and professional response and do give great credit to them for it and for our server for warning me of the allergy contamination, I am not taking them up on the offer. An additional issue we had was that they fry fish and shrimp in the same oil as everything else including bacon apparently, and cook fish on the burger grill so as a fish allergy sufferer, I was not even able to eat anything. I ordered several things but kept being told they were for one reason or another fish contaminated. I greatly appreciate that the server and cook did inform me. This is the one saving grace in the service. Many restaurants will pan cook something if they do not perform other cross contamination limiting practices. This restaurant won't even pan cook a burger!  Fish/shellfish allergies are so common it is surprising a chef run restaurant would not have a plan in place for pan cooking or a separate fryer for fish. I did not include this in my original review since it is only of consequence to 1 in 25 diners but to further explain why we are declining returning.  This is not an allergy friendly place so not good for groups and my son and spouse who were able to eat (at different times due to service/ kitchen issues) said the food was uninspired, tasted of the fridge and was the worst mushy mac and cheese ever."}
{"text":"I've given this place a few chances. I've been here 4 times in total since it was close to my house. Not once have I had a great experience. The service is always what kills it each time, the waiters either didn't know the specials, beers, or just rarely came by. Each time the waiters were never very friendly.  Today, the 18th, we were attended to once every thirty minutes, our waters sat empty for quiet a bit of this time. When we finally got our orders in, the food came out burnt. Both orders the same, my girlfriend ate hers due to hunger but I had mine taken off our bill. No apologizes were given, or even empathy, just a simple \"ok I'll comp this\".  I'm extremely disappointed, I'm still hungry and now in a bad mood. I won't be coming here a fifth time nor will I be recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"I'm done with this place. I was with a group on the patio enjoying my cigar when I was approached by a man from inside that was a little less than polite.  He said the cigar could be smelled from inside the building and had to move to the farthest end of the patio. I asked who he was and then at thst point he identified himself by name and indicated that he is the general manager. My background includes managing and owning a restaurant so it became a  teachable moment.  I gave him a polite dressing down as to how to address a situation like this in the future by introducing himself first by name and title before asking for action to be taken.  I was beyond the legal distance from a door for smoking and no posting was present with regards to the patio smoking policy. Perhaps a small investment in a sign for the patio may save him in future embarrasment."}
{"text":"I was in the area and stopped by for a beer. Due to the great service, stayed and ordered the sausage pretzel board. This required a more investigate beer selection. What a great afternoon! I highly recommend stopping in to enjoy what they have built."}
{"text":"Pro tip: Ride your bike in to enjoy happy hour prices all day long! It's like having a VIP pass.  Dear management, your staff is balls to the wall awesome. They are total non-slackers and are super friendly.   Want to eat awesome food and drink awesome drinks? Yep! Want to dine in and and support an awesome neighborhood? Yep! Want to enjoy a leisurely bike ride home after a few drinks instead of any stressful alternatives? Double yep!   Spoke and Wheel is both a good option for a first date and a night out with the girls/guys. The food is good and the wine flows like the salmon of Capistrano. Seriously, just check it out."}
{"text":"Good food, great atmosphere! Burger was really tasty and server was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable nachos!! Service is always great. Alexis did a great job as our server. Patio is big enough to handle a lot of people at once."}
{"text":"Spoke and Wheel is THE SPOT for cyclists. They give people who ride their bikes in happy hour deals all day every day- and let me tell ya- it's a deal. They do wings and a PITCHER of beer for like $11 (happy hour). The wings are plump- tasty- and I think you get 10 per order. Very worthwhile. Try them dry rubbed with the sauce on the side. They also do a burger, fries, and a PITCHER of beer for $13.50. You really can't beat it. I believe if you just want to drink on happy hour, a pitcher of beer is $5, and one of their signature cocktail is $5 also. They have delicious guacamole and chips (a happy hour thing) and the one thing I have had that isn't on happy hour but is pretty dang tasty is their appetizer board... It comes with sausages, DELICIOUS pretzels with cheese, fingerling potatoes... Yum. But it's like $14. Pricey, but worth the occasional splurge. They also do team trivia one night a week.   The main point to take away from this is to ride your bike in anytime for happy hour- or just go during happy hour. They have ample outdoor seating, but do get pretty packed later in the evening."}
{"text":"This makes the top five of the worst dinning experiences I have ever had. My girlfriend and I were waiting for almost an hour for our order when the waiter finally tells us he forgot to enter the order in the computer and they never started preparing it. He seemed to be on something if you know what I mean. He offered to put it in with a discount and apologized.  When our food finally came out the crispy chicken sandwich I ordered was pathetic. After the meal I received the check and it was barely even a discount. Not once did the manager check in on us and the discount on the ticket was for an employee meal for around five bucks. I bet management was unaware of anything happening on the dining floor. All though I've  enjoyed meals here in the past I doubt I will ever return after tonight! Poor service, poor food and even worse management! (Well lack of management. ) Hopefully this place gets it together."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood place we rode to on the canal from Biltmore area. Excellent,  interesting variety of food,  unique handmade sodas & drinks.Laid-back atmosphere,  great patio and fabulous tunes!"}
{"text":"My burger was amazing.  Perfectly cooked. The bun was delicious also.   I had the green chili burger. The beer prices were great.  A pitcher was the cost as a pint.  I will definitely cone back here again."}
{"text":"Our group comes here regularly because it is very close to where we meet and has a great atmosphere, good food with really good drinks/specials. We have been there maybe 50+ times. I have never heard anyone complain about the food. However, I would not recommend ordering the nachos if you're in a large group. It seems like they were one of the first dishes made and sat there, getting soggy until the rest of the food was done. The bits that were not soggy were tasty, so I'd say that they would be good if you were in a smaller group of 1-5 people maybe. We usually have 6+ people, and that means we often have a longer wait than usual. It's worth noting. None of us are in too much of a hurry, so that will not affect my review. Recently, they changed the fries from the thin, natural cut style to the stereotypical bar fries that are thick and battered and obviously came out of the freezer. Fries are just too important to me to let that slide. :} If that were not the case, I'd probably rate this place a 5.  2018 update: our group frequents this place less and less often. Their waits are getting pretty long and it's getting harder for me to defend them. Add to that, they play exclusively country music now. I wouldn't say that's usually a deal-breaker, it certainly is not a positive"}
{"text":"Had a great meal and enjoyed our dining experience! Our waiter Alex was fun, engaging and enthusiastic! We loved it and we'll be back with friends."}
{"text":"I came in with a group of 10 for drinks and appetizers after the ArtWalk. We were all shocked that a new place could be this bad! For example: Incredibly skimpy servings for very hi prices! Wine pours are the smallest you have ever seen at any establishment, and at $9. a glass. We ordered guac & chips and could not believe the small anount oif chips in the bowl. Cmon, how can you skimp on chips? Another person at the table also ordered it, and again it came out with a few chips scattered on the bottom. The guac tasted really odd, and when I looked, I saw it had a lot of goat cheese on top. Yuk!   Thankfully, our waitress brought me out some guac with no cheese. She said she was sympathetic because she was a vegan. I left her a good tip - I hope she got it! There were plenty of servers, but the food took forever to come out, our fries came out COLD and mushy and tasteless.   And, one person ordered a \"bottle of beer\". She was given a glass of beer that was completely FLAT! Not one bubble! It must have been sitting on the counter for hours to be that flat! When she asked the server why she did not get the bottle she ordered, he said: \"we don't serve in a bottle, we pour it into a glass for you\". Did not ask if she wanted a bottle, or ask \"how is it\". Let's insult the customers' intelligence in additon to insulting their taste buds! DO NOT go there, let them go out of business, ASAP!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Fun trivia and great service.  As a teacher, I need a break. Tuesdays are my salvation. I look forward to winning trivia, drinking a cold beer, eating tomato soup, and our server Alex. Love this place and it's just in our backyard. Ask for Alex!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a GREAT neighborhood restaurant and this is it!!  Great variety of food and drinks.  We've been there more than 10 times and still love it!  My favorite menu item ... Mussels!  So Good!!!  Have had the Hamburger, Sonoran Hot Dog, Wings and several other menu items and have never been disappointed.  Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in Town  Brian the bartender is awesome, he will take care of you!"}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood restaurant in a great location--right on the bridle path on central and off the canal. They have a nice patio wedged right in between the bridle path and canal. Ride your bike here for happy hour all day! I like that they have small pitchers of beer; its just the right amount for two people (if you just want a beer each) or one person (if you want a couple beers for yourself) There are small tvs on the walls behind the booths; not the greatest to watch a game but ok if don't care about the game and are more focused on food.   Just about everything I've had here has been good. The pretzel and sausage plate is a really good app. The crispy chicken sandwich and chicken and biscuits are my favorite. The burger was, surprisingly, just okay."}
{"text":"On Mother's day we cycled to Spoke & Wheel via the canal. Only to find that the only place we were allowed to sit was at the bar. The lovely patio was empty, and indoors it was pretty empty.  As other establishments, there was a Sunday brunch on the menu. We were invited to only sit at the bar and the very limited happy hour menu was our only choice, unless we were willing to take part in the $30 brunch. The food was very good and the brews hit the spot after the very warm bike ride. I may revisit. The female bartender finally warmed up to us, but the initial continued stop signs of, your options are only this and that, was not a way to start off my first experience with Spoke and Wheel."}
{"text":"Where do I even start? Let's first start when we were seated, our waitress had \"judged\" us on the booth we had chosen and said it was a little too big for two people. Secondly when asked for our choice a drink my acquaintance asked for pint of ballast point, and she questioned us him on the amount with a very rude connotation to it. And he had to repeat himself saying \"yes a pint\" .. and then she impolitely ask him for his ID.. Thirdy every time she would walk over to us, she would give us extremely dirty looks. Last the food wasn't very tasty and would not refer this place to anyone.."}
{"text":"I like this place and want it to succeed, but they are trying very hard to sink it.  The staff displays a spectacular disregard for their customers, to the point that I suspect there's a high-dollar prize for the server who can go the longest without addressing a customer.  This is a case for the invisible hand."}
{"text":"Definitely had an excellent selection on the menu. I would say 4 stars based on the awesome vibe, excellent sangria, and delicious tacos! The server was nice and consistent. I had the carne asada tacos which were seasoned perfectly and was topped with guacamole and lettuce. They had beans in a warm broth on the side which were great! My sangria was sweet and had fresh fruit. For sure will be back!"}
{"text":"Second time here. Went for lunch today. Extremely poor service: slow, inattentive, & messy. Food was served cold and missing sides.  Won't be going back anytime soon.  First visit much better.  Don't go anytime soon. So many more choices in the area providing better service and quality."}
{"text":"Every aspect of this establishment was sorely lacking. From the junior wait staff, to the mediocre food, and that's giving it more credit then it deserves, it was all around bad. They even managed to make a Ballast Point sculpin on draft taste bad.This place has never been able to make a go of it, and here's another classic example of that. In the words of my husband, this place SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Friendly staff and food is good. The $5 beers in pitcher are awesome. The spoke and wheel burger is great!"}
{"text":"The Spoke and Wheel is open!  We live in the neighborhood and were anxiously awaiting the opening, we were disappointed at the initial delay.  The restaurant looks nicely redone, paint, flooring and lighting are comfortable and fitting for a tavern.  That unfortunately, is the high point of our visit.  The staff is not well trained or coordinating well with each other or the kitchen. Several tables around us were having difficulties with incorrect orders and poorly prepared food.  My husband wanted the Pale Ale, Lagunitas, however they were out.  The restaurant only opened the day before. I ordered a salad and sweet potato fries, the fries were forgotten. When the fries did arrive they were hot, crisp and delicious.  The salad was over dressed.  My husband ordered the green chili chicken wrap, it was good.  We hope they work out the kinks and take the time to train the staff from the hostess to the waiters.  This place  looks like it has potential we hope they smooth things out."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place. Service is super slow when they're not staffed properly though, just a heads up."}
{"text":"Terrible service, food is mediocre with exception of burgers which r quite good. Oh ya, kraft drinks  are complete fail as well."}
{"text":"Average place, average food. We sat on the patio on cushiony furniture. Then the bugs showed up - our feet and ankles were bitten repeatedly. Won't go back."}
{"text":"This is such a great restaurant, and feels so comfortable. Love the staff and manager- they're about as friendly as it gets! It's so nice when the patio doors are open in this beautiful November weather, and just adds to the lovely atmosphere. The food is presented as wonderfully as it tastes, and gets an A+++ in my book!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood tavern with one of the best Happy Hours in the area! Small pitchers of beer are just $5 (including microbrews like lagunitas!), and there's a healthy list of well priced apps like street tacos, and piggy wings.   Happy Hour is from 2pm-6pm in the restaurant, but 2pm-6pm and again from 7pm-close if you sit at the bar, and if you Ride your bike you get Happy Hour prices all day long!"}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite with the family and have never been.   I ordered their biscuits and gravy, husband had the green chilie burger and daughter a bacon cheeseburger.  The burgers were great!!  Flavorful and a good size.  Not to mention the mac and cheese was a nice surprise.   My biscuits and gravy would have been great... had they not way overcooked the eggs.  They advertise two over easy eggs because there really isn't a lot of gravy involved.  The eggs yolk would have made this dish.  Fried chicken layered in was not very browned...you want a nice crunch even if you know it may come out soft mixed in a dish like this.  I probably wouldn't order this again. Definitely be back to eat a burger though... and to check out their happy hour."}
{"text":"I love this place, really excellent food ! ... great service and atmosphere ! The best burger I've had in a long time. The $20 smoked rib eye steak was perfect, and a good deal. I certainly recommend Spoke and Wheel."}
{"text":"The place would get at least four stars if they didn't treat you like a felon. The food for the most part was very good although salad portions were on the small side and crispy bacon was undercooked. Issue was with the drink service, we were required to give the bartender our credit card to hold because one of us(party of 2 55+ years old) had a Moscow mule and they were afraid we would steal their precious copper cup. We only has one drink each and Granted we were sitting at a table and there was one other table in the room that was occupied and one person sitting at the bar so it would be hard to keep track of what was going on,  but it only became a problem for us after we paid the bill and the bartender REFUSED to give us our credit card back until we virtually handed her the empty mug and stood up to leave! Can be sure we won't go back nor recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"No matter what time of day or day of the week the food is always consistent.   Had the cyclist burger and it is the best in the valley!  Ruby was helped us at the bar and she is great!  She never stopped once. .. Very friendly and remembered us!   Of you haven't tried Spoke & Wheel, you must!  You will not be disappointed!   Yelp them out!"}
{"text":"The best part about this meal was that it ended.   The good: The inside is nice and there are a number of large televisions. A sports fan lacking olfactory glands would enjoy this place.   The Meal: my steak tasted like sausage. I'd like to think it was the product of an amorous relationship between a cow and pig but I'm pretty sure they just cooked the steak on top of where they cooked our sausage appetizer without cleaning the grill.   The calamari tasted like it was the byproduct of an actual spoke and wheel. I assume it was the wheel based on its texture.   Maybe this is my fault. I should know better than to order sea food and a steak at a local watering hole. Please do not make the same assumption that ordering food on the menu will be edible. I encourage the owner to take these items off the menu or make them into a combo platter named Burnin' Rubber."}
{"text":"Excellent beer choices and we love the street tacos and black mussels. Aaron L. Was our server and TOP notch all the way. My cup never runneth empty! We are close enough to cycle and when we run the canal, its snack and beer time. Good place to re-energize after a run or cycle ride."}
{"text":"Tasty stop when biking in the area. Weather your on the canal nearby or taking the Murphy Bridal Path (bike, walk, horseback). This is a great stop at the top of the line. Great beer and food and family friendly.   To the staff at Spoke and Wheel.. NICE JOB!"}
{"text":"Everything was mediocre to below average. With so many other area options like Corbin's, Timo and North Mountain Brewing there is no reason for me to ever go back to Spoke and Wheel. It is too bad since I always hope a good restaurant will open in this building. None have lasted long so it may be the layout or location. They should level it and start from scratch."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Poor service and terrible food.  After watching our server walk by us to wait on other tables she then began greeting customers at the bar.  We finally asked another server if we could place our order.  She told us our server was behind the bar but she could take our order.  The food took about 40 minutes and this was after we politely asked if our order was placed.  We had to ask for refills and our check at the end of our meal.  The server brought us our credit card receipt and then said. \"Let me get these plates out if your way\".  Slow and poor service may be acceptable if the restaurant was busy.  We were one of 6 tables in the restaurant.  Very displeased with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome place with a great happy hour special that goes from 11am-6pm, 7pm-close. The service has improved significantly since they first opened and Brian is an awesome bartender who does a great job taking care of everyone. Kaitlin is also a great server who is great with customers."}
{"text":"So, I really wanted to love this place. I saw news channel 3 broadcasting this place as dog-friendly with great food and drinks. We drove down from the north valley to check it out. We brought our 6 month old baby and our dog to enjoy a family meal together which we rarely get to do.  I ordered the Sonoran hotdog. It was awful. Extremely dry, bad bun and not much flavor except for the mustard and salty dog.The hotdog itself was hard, crunchy and old looking. I am a huge foodie and always finish all my food...this, I could not. It was that bad. I hardly ever take time to write a review unless something is spectacular or so awful that I want to help others save their money.  My husband ordered the the truffle burger and mac and cheese. Burger was mediocre at best. Mac and cheese was so bland, I looked to make sure it wasn't buttered pasta.  We definitely will not be returning here. If you live in the area and are looking to just ride in on your bike and have a beer this place will serve just fine...other than that, save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Want to rate this higher, as its my local place. Price and hit or miss service keeps it at three stars. Overall, everything is okay here. The food is above average, but pricey. It advertises as a family place, but a family of four eating reasonably can't get out of there for less than $50. There's something there called \"Spot at the Bar\", where you can get HH drink prices all day. Ride your bike, HH drink prices as well. Otherwise, a very short HH that ends early... Not good if one has to stay later at work.  The wings are excellent- we had the chipotle wings. The burgers are solid, but I wish they had some pizza selections. The mixed drinks are great! Beer and draft selection is average. It would be nice to install a double fridge with some unique craft bomber selections. Trivia nights are packed and fun! The overall ambiance is nice, although I can never quite get the right angle for TV sports, especially when sitting at one of the booths. The service is inconsistent, but has been improving... Brian (does he still work there?) and Ruby are friendly and quick. The location is great, too. Located on the canal, so it's nice to stop in after a run or ride in NorPho. Views of PHX Mountain Preserve are great. A big plus, dog friendly patio. Definitely worth a visit, even a return visit... But have some bucks saved up."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Spoke & Wheel for lunch after a bike ride, the day after it officially opened. We were greeted and seated immediately at one of the curved seating booths. We decided on the outdoor patio seating instead. The patio was covered, had lights, and we could see misters set up. There was also a fire pit. The smoking area was set far back on the northernmost part of the patio. There were no smokers so we don't know if that would have affected our outdoor dining experience. We were served by Rachel who made some beer suggestions and took our drink orders. I had the vanilla pomegranate, a virgin cocktail of pomegranate juice, vanilla, and lemon. My bf ordered a Sleepy Dog Irish Ale because Lagunitas wasn't available. Both drinks were excellent. For lunch we decided to try a 1/4 lb burger (the \"smash burger,\" not to be confused with the 1/2 lb \"phat burger\"). They grind their own meat on site and cook it to your desired doneness. We both preferred medium rare for our burgers, and they were cooked just right. The seasoning we both selected was the Black Truffle burger, which had truffle oil, bacon, and port wine seasoning. Phenomenal. Our sides were the cactus salad (another great suggestion by Rachel), and waffle cut sweet potato fries. We couldn't finish everything but we were extremely happy with our lunch experience at Spoke & Wheel. For only being open for two days we were pretty impressed. We would have liked a stronger bike theme (a few random cruiser bicycles were scattered for bike theme decor) and for the owner to actually subscribe to Pandora (ads in between songs??). Beer selection was decent - while choices were limited, they were good quality beers. The menu had some great appetizer choices as well as a broad selection of side orders. We love that it's right off of the Arizona Canal so accessibility is great for a beer after a bike ride, though we didn't recall seeing a bike rack outside. We will definitely be coming back here to try some of the other menu items, and we will definitely recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"I really like this place and would give it 5 stars, good food, friendly service, neat atmosphere - but the restrooms!?!?!?!?!  WORST smelling in the valley. I don't know if there's some sort of sewage issue going on but the odor is repugnant and an appetite killer. I've mentionned it to various servers and bartenders, yet the only thing that seems to be done is cramming air 'fresheners' in and around the restrooms. Hey owners and management - FIX THE PROBLEM, don't try to cover it up!!! Will try this place again and if the problem isn't fixed then I'll insist my party (of usually 4-8+ very hungry & thirsty drinkers) go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I usually stop in once a week or so and this place is great. All of the staff members are great to deal with! Jason and Alexis are very professional and courteous. The best selection of craft beer on draft in the area! Nice people! I love spoke and wheel."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, great atmosphere, dog friendly patio, and great specials! I wish it was busier but I love coming here just the same."}
{"text":"Try the Sonoran Hot Dog. Always order a side of house beans--the best. How can you go wrong this happy hour beer prices? Sliders are super; unfortunately, only served during football season."}
{"text":"Brian the bartender rocks! Dales on tap = love"}
{"text":"Nothing like sitting in a warm bar, drinking WARM beer and eating a cold burger on a hot day. This used to be my favorite place to come to but it's just not the same anymore. Burgers used to be the tastiest, juiciest burgers around. Now they're dry and bland. Buns are still frozen in the middle, meat is dry and the cheese is cold too. Beer has, unfortunately, always been warm...."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for dinner with friends.  Great fish Tacos and first time I had the chicken pizza. So hard to get away from the awesome burgers but so worth it. Thanks Aaron L for the suggestion. He was a very attentive and helpful server, always a pleasure to see him."}
{"text":"We went here last night for only the 2nd time.  The bartender Brian was great.  Good service, made menu recommendations, and explained their specials very well.  We will be back to this fun neighboorhood bar/resturant."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I brought the kids in Saturday night for some food and to watch the Sun Devil Football game. How stoked was I when the Bartender Brian gave us a great Booth and put the Sun Devils game on right in front of me and then gave me the Dbacks game right next to it on another TV ...Awesome start to the night....   After placing our food order the Bartender took the kids over to a TV that had X-box on it and it kept the kids occupied ... For appetizers we had sliders which were delicious and for dinner we had the Original Burger and the Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich which we totally enjoyed w/ Mac and Cheese which I suggest as a side ...... We had a great night and will definitely come back-- the service was great ( Thanks Brian!) we enjoyed the food, the kids had an awesome time and the Sun Devils WIN !"}
{"text":"This place was legit - they let us in right before closing on the night of my little sister's dance recital and made her night that much better! Great burgers & fries - have the one with green chili on it! nomnom."}
{"text":"We are at Spoke & Wheel basically once every week or two (slightly obsessive, we know--but if you find something that works you stick with it!). It's our absolute favorite neighborhood spot, for a few different reasons. The food is tasty, super consistent, and always comes out nice and hot (unless you get the chilled shrimp, which is my go-to on happy hour). They serve our favorite beer - San Tan Epicenter which is actually hard to find on draft! Anything from burgers, to the Sonoran dog, to their awesome deviled egg apps are just so great.  We usually see Ryan there, or on the rare nights that Eden is serving and not behind the bar, we are always so happy to have them as our servers. These two seriously just hit it out of the park with their personable, friendly and overall fantastic service.   The patio is THE BEST, with a variety of seating from raised booths to lounge-level couches and Adirondack chairs/coffee tables. This is perfect if you bring your pup, or like us, ride your bikes in for all-day happy hour and enjoy the beautiful AZ weather.   We still have yet to participate in the Trivia nights on Tuesdays and Saturdays, but have sat and enjoyed our dinner/observed the fun. While it's a full house on these nights, it's such a chill crowd and great for date night or families.   Big props to the S&W staff--we LOVE you guys!"}
{"text":"A real hidden gem..  Great food and a friendly staff make this a great place to hang out.."}
{"text":"I love this place, it reminds me of a place I used to go as a kid in Cheyenne.  Relaxing and quiet with a tasty menu and a good atmosphere.  Plenty of seating and nice big backed booths for a quiet dinner.   The sandwiches are delicious and the mac and cheese is a big hit with the kids."}
{"text":"The food is good when it's served warm. The service is consistently slow and at times awful. If there were more options In the area, I would never go here."}
{"text":"Just opened down the street from me, already one of my fave spots. ...had a great time, good atmosphere drinks and food, will b back soon!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this place as it was put in an older building that once had the Top of Central, it is a cyclist friendly place, big patio & doggie friendly. The ambiance was nice & that's where it ends pretty much. This was a Sunday. around 6 p.m. & there were 2 servers for the entire place (incl patio)  so the service was lacking to put it mildly. The what appeared to be the manager was bussing & taking drink orders, refills & he got mine wrong. I ordered a cocktail & got a beer that sounded like the cocktail I ordered. Major bummer but I like beer so I sucked it up. The burger we tried was mediocre but was cooked properly. Needed seasoning & the garlic truffle fries were just greasy & shoe string cut. Which is good for me on the cut but not the hubs fave. We tried an app as well but it escapes me what it was now (been a few weeks) but that tells ya something. I can't remember it must have been lacking. So disappointed that we can't give it a second try. Usually if we are into the concept or idea of place we give it another try. Because every single restaurant in town can have an off weekend with a chef or server or barkeep calling in sick. But this was just more bads than good unfortunately."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times now. First time the bar closed 1 hour early, no service. Second time they opened 1 hour late, no service. Third time, took a cab there for dinner at 9pm on a Friday, they closed 1 hour early. No service. Every time  I checked their hours on-line....won't be going there again."}
{"text":"In from out of town and every thing was great. Mike H. Helped me out when I misoredered."}
{"text":"We went there last night with friends for dinner. I had the street tacos which were excellent. My wife had the fried chicken and Mac'n'cheese. That was great too. We all shared their chocolate cake for desert. It came as a huge slice, perfect for 4 people. The ambiance was pretty quiet but that was nice for conversations. They also have nice drinks. I had their mule which was good."}
{"text":"We were there on a Monday night at 5:30 for a large group with a reservation, but they seemed like they weren't prepared for us. Took us two hours to get our food. I think they were cooking on a one-burner sterno stove, and then they'd carry out one plate at a time. The French fries were great but everything else was pretty inedible - either way too spicy or no flavor at all. Mac and cheese tasted like velveeta, twice baked potato was just a regular baked potato.  Bathroom smelled awful and whole place smelled like beer. Eau de frathouse.  Wanted to like it but I can't recommend it other than the fries."}
{"text":"So happy this place moved into the neighborhood! This is a great place to end a family bike ride! in fact you get happy hour all day long if you ride up on your bike. $5 pitchers for happy hour and great food options on the happy hour menu! our server Kaitlin was great! She was extremely knowledgeable and extremely personable. Keep up the great work Kaitlin!  Try they tacos all of them are great! (The fish tacos are a little bland but still pretty good!) The Sangria was also really delicious... Very fresh!  I also like what they have done with the inside... Still a little gloomy and dark inside but not to shabby on the new decor. The patio is great and could use some decoration love or maybe some cool plants but still has amazing potential! (This patio would be great with a fire pit or heaters in the winter time)   I'll be back to try some more awesome food and enjoy the great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wild Thyme Restaurants never ever dissapoint me with food. With that being said I can tell Spoke and Wheel will be just as phenomenal as Brick and Timo (I have not been to Ken's Creekside.) The new ambience is SO much better than Dillons BBQ and the music fits the theme perfectly :-) we had the Mushroom Burger (no meat) which is super phenomenal. My son got the mac & cheese with fries, the mac and cheese was really good too! The homemade Guacamole is to die for. For opening just Monday this place was rockin and busy, I have no doubts that it will thoroughly please the neighborhood as much as Timo and Brick (and I'm sure Ken's Creekside as well ;-) ) Keep up the good work guys  I posted a picture of the Mushrrom Burger and deviled eggs"}
{"text":"First time here and very satisfied. Had the sausage and soft pretzel sampler and iceberg with bacon, hard boiled egg & blue cheese salad. Great! (Though asked for extra dressing). Burgers the boys had got thumbs up. I'm not a cyclist but loved the atmosphere...open, lot of wood, warm & friendly. Good deal on pitchers of beer. Could have had bigger selection but decent variety. Our waitress Charlotte was very accommodating, professional and friendly. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I work right down the street,  & go there every week or other week.  I am a huge fan of the fish & chips. It is a different take on the usual dish, but it is AMAZING! The fish is covered lightly, but with a great batter. The fries are shoe string garlic yumminess. The street tacos are also a sure bet. I have heard the burgers are good too, but I usually can't resist my favorite order. My husband and  eight year old son have also joined me for dinner there several times,  and are also big fans.  I really can't say enough good things about this place:) I have been telling all my friends,  and most of my coworkers are now going there too."}
{"text":"what can I say, I love this place.  One of my favorite features of any bar is just that...  a nice large bar.  S&W offers up a great place to stool up and watch a game on their many connected TV's.  Sports fan fantasy.   What is a game without a Hot Dog - Sonoran Hot Dog to be exact.   I got mine with a side of Kale - yep, that healthy leafy green that is all the rage of 2013 is offed as a side.  Delicious!  Bar aside, the Restaurant is lined with huge booths around the parameter and the outdoor patio is HUGE.  Perfect for the midsummer nights.  In addition to the Sonoran Hot Dog and Kale - I got a side of wings...  Dry Rub, crispy on the outside juicy on the inside wings and they may go down as my favorite secret wing spot.  I don't like over sauced wings!  Add a huge range of beers on Tap and this Baseball dude is in the sweet spot.  Check out the Spoke and wheel...  ...  they also offer a discount to those who ride a bike.  Pedal out!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and lots of good beer on tap. One of the best burgers I've ever had @ $10-12. Ambiance is a little weird, looks like it can't decide if it wants to be a fancy restaurant or a sports bar, lots of speakers so music was audible without being over powering.  Our server seemed a little distracted, and then she left us with the guy who had been helping us all night anyways and it was much better. Hope he got to keep the fat tip I left him."}
{"text":"The patio has really turned around. The inside is always well maintained and it's nice to see that attention has been given to the patio area as well. It looks like it gets cleaned up more often now so look out summer patio dining, here I come!  The staff is friendly and prompt and the chips and guac, or hatch chili burger are great.  That and $5 pitchers during happy hour make this a great local hang out. Trivia nights on Saturday are a lot of fun too, but look out for the \"wild and crazy guy\" he usually wins every time."}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood hangout in North Central Phoenix. The food is good, the service is friendly - although not always that fast - and the selection of beer, wine, and cocktails will keep you going. They have a nice large patio for when the weather is nice and plenty of room inside. The parking lot seems a little wonky, but considering its called Spoke & Wheel, you are really encouraged to ride your bike. All in all, this is a nice little place in the center of town."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix while on vacation. Decided to come here for brunch on a nice warm Saturday. We all decided to have breakfast items. This breakfast was awesome and different. I had the biscuits and gravy which had fried chicken, beer brat, biscuit, and then covered in gravy. Sounds like too much but it was not. It was awesome."}
{"text":"Service was slow but t super friendly. They had a band starting at 8. Got there at six and all beverages including water were served to us in plastic cups. Server even said they ran out of cups however, not busy. I got the chilled chicken salad which was $14 and I anticipated a big portion. I was wrong. The smallest portion I've ever seen w 2oz of chicken and that may be generous. A few of us ordered coors light and it was served from the tap. Other patrons had bottles. Didn't know I had to specify. Makes matters worse we requested separate checks and all the coors were different prices. Again, super friendly service but never coming here again."}
{"text":"I have used this venue to book 2 large events and both times they have been great. No minimum or fee to reserve the entire patio, and everyone got separate checks with no trouble. Would highly recommend if you're trying to get a large group together, staff was great."}
{"text":"Food is great, so is location, but if you come here when it is busy, service can be very slow."}
{"text":"Never again. Decided to try this place again, and boy was I disappointed.  Bike parking on the patio is great, if they actually unlock the patio door so you could use it. Had to go inside to come out the patio so we could lock up our bikes. Do they not expect cyclists to stop in on a Sunday...?  Service was lacking big time. Attempted to order a cherry Coke, was told they don't have that... right... Apparently their bar doesn't stock grenadine, or this waitress was clueless. Thinking the latter. I shook my head and just ordered a Coke. Starting off on the wrong foot already.  Supposed to be all day happy hour if you ride in. Had no problems taking advantage of that on my first visit which was outside regular happy hour. This time, I had to point it out on the menu to the waitress before we ordered food, and this is after we had mentioned that we rode in when she took our drink order. As if us being red and sweaty wasn't indication enough.  Speaking of sweaty, this place is a sweat lodge. Never got below 84° per my phone in the booth we were in. They had a few portable a/c units near the windows, which are of no help unless you're sitting 4 feet away from them.  Spent most of our time just waiting for our order in the hot stuffy dining room. Food and drinks  service was VERY slow.   Could not wait to flee this place for good. Not recommended. Could be good, but service, atmosphere and food is severely lacking. Just head up the street to North Mountain and have a much better time."}
{"text":"Last weekend my friends and I went to have a couple drinks, we could not have loved our waitress Caitlyn more. She had such an infectious personality. Kudos to whoever hired her! She's amazing!"}
{"text":"There prices seem a little steep for the Sunnyslope area I had the Philly Cheesteak sandwich which was ok and it was $14... Service was good though. Cut back on the airport pricing."}
{"text":"Great place.  Burger was really good.  Stopped in for lunch.  Definitely will stopped by next time in area."}
{"text":"Came in for linner, the time between lunch and dinner, to grab happy hour... Very empty which was a surprise. As we enjoyed our $5 cocktails we overheard about a Family Feud style game played on the multiple tvs the align the walls.  We ordered the trio of tacos which included : house made chicken chorizo, steak and grilled fish. These were served with a cup of spicy, white, pinto beans and a green salsa... Nothing too spicy We liked the freshness of the food.  I will return for sure."}
{"text":"Great hangout spot.  I've been pleased with everything I've ever ordered but my fav is the freshly made chicken chorizo nachos.  So yummy.  They always have great beer on tap and a pitcher is $5 during happy hour (good stuff, not just coor's light).  The banana churro dessert is ridiculous in a good way.  Always great service. HAPPY HOUR ALL DAY IF YOU RIDE YOUR BIKE."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Pleasantly surprised, quiet and comfortable place with very quick and efficient service. Deviled eggs were tasty. The soup, salad, sandwich combo was great. The Star turned out to be the French fries. Can't wait to go back and try the banana churros. Only suggestion is usse less soft bread on the shrimp po boy."}
{"text":"I just love this place !!! I am pescatarian so i always get their Ahi Tuna burger and it's not only the best in Arizona it's the best Ahi Tuna burger I have ever had and I had many of them all over . The Tuna is always fresh and the pieces of fish are big and nice . It comes with grated ginger inside and aioli which work perfect together ! I never tried their hamburgers but my friends told me they are amazing I had their veggie portobello \"hamburger\" which comes with goat cheese and it was awesome too !   Ps  The ratio of fish and bun is perfect  The service was always good  And I have nice experience working and making fresh fish and if I love it I think I am pretty sure u will. ."}
{"text":"When on a bike ride, what is better fitting then this place. And when riding your bike it's happy hour all day. $5 per pitcher of beer. :-)  Food was delicious.   Atmosphere is very casual and relaxed. We sat outside in the sun which was great, but the inside looks inviting as well."}
{"text":"I love to leave a restaurant trying to figure out what I will have next time I am in.  That's how it is here.  Our group of four did burgers and Philly cheese steak sandwiches.  Everything was great.  We had a side of waffle cut sweet potato fries with one meal, Mac n cheese with another, shoestring potatoes with Parmesan and garlic and one healthy side of asparagus.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed our perfect fall weather.  Next trip in I am riding my bike for the happy hour deal!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch in the late morning. This place doesn't feel comfortable. Nothing made sense about the decor as it was trying to look somewhat upscale yet there are 90\" flat screens lining every in inch of free space on the walls, again very uncomfortable   Service was terrible. The place was empty yet our waiter seemed preoccupied with anything but us. Other than the fact that he was unaccommodating, he was sarcastic and lazy, and had no idea about the menu."}
{"text":"I had the biscuits and gravy for brunch and they were ammmmmmaaazzzzing!! The atmosphere was a little blah, they could easily make the place super cute with the spoke and wheel theme but it was a little dive-ish. All and all what really counts is the food and it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is such a delight! The atmosphere is a perfect combination of classy, yet hip & relaxed. The outdoor patio is a perfect way to spend a fun Friday night with friends. Indoors, I have enjoyed a meal with just my husband & kids and then again with a large gathering of family. Both times we were perfectly accommodated & always felt comfortable. They have a good selection of drinks, I personally love the white sangria. The first time I ate here I ordered the nachos as my entrée. They tasted great but I was more impressed by the portion, I couldn't finish it by myself. The second time we went, I ordered the chicken, biscuits & gravy. I don't think I will get a chance to try any other dishes because this dish blew me away! It was seriously delicious. Everything on the plate was on point. The chicken was so juicy & flavorful (says alot because I prefer beef to chicken usually) the biscuits & gravy were rich & satisfying. To top the already sinful meal, it came with a side of mac & cheese! I often think about it & when I can go back just to eat it all again."}
{"text":"Food is great & our waitress Michelle was wonderful to us! Quick service, I had the Mediterranean pasta and it was just right except the portion was too large for me but who really complains about that? Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is along the canal bike trail and for good reason, it's a pit stop for cyclists. So if you cycle in you'll get happy hour all day. It's a great idea, like an oasis in the desert for cyclists.   I ordered the Spoke N' Wheel Burger which was divine! It had caramelized onions, jalapenos, cheddar, sweet potato fry, and a sweet chili sauce. It was phenomenal, very juicy, and delicious! I also ordered it medium rare and that was done right as well. They had unique sides which was refreshing. I ordered the Sweet Potato Waffle Fries, but they also had Sauteed Garlic Kale, and Grilled Asparagus, among many others.   The place was clean, the bathrooms had beautiful finishes, and the service was great! The only downside are the prices. My burger was around $16. So keep that in mind unless you come in with a bike, then you're always welcomed to the happy hour menu at anytime of the day!"}
{"text":"I'm really picky about wings but this is about average I was told it was hot but it seems mild hot. On the plus side the wings are meaty"}
{"text":"Today was the second time I've visited this restaurant. Just like the first time, the wait staff greeted us like a bad smell. Unlike the first time, however, the service did not improve. My friend saw a sign that said seat yourselves, so we did. And there we waited for about 10 minutes at a dirty table while not a single solitary employee came by to bus the table. After they did, we ordered food. Two of the items we requested were sold out, which we were informed of after we placed the order (and waited a fairly long time). When our food arrived via someone other than our waitress, we were asked if there was anything else we needed. Yes. Silverware. The not-our-waitress never returned and 5-10 minutes later our waitress did arrive. I requested silverware. She was gone for at least another 2 minutes (luckily my lunch date was a great conversationalist) but as we sat there with the breeze blowing across the patio, of course our food got cold. I didn't dare send it back and ask that it be re-heated. (We've all heard the many horror stories, and if the staff can't even mask their ill will toward their patrons, I wouldn't risk have my food mishandled in any way.) So, I ate my $15 lunch, cold. Also, when the waitress did procure the silverware, she mentioned that probably the reason the other wait staff never returned with it is because the kitchen didn't have any. Overall, the atmosphere was disorganized, unprofessional, frankly a joke. Although the food had good flavor, we probably will not return. To our waitress's credit, aside from not knowing which dishes were sold out, not noticing beforehand that we lacked silverware, she was more courteous and professional than the 3-4 other employees who interacted with us."}
{"text":"Having just moved to the area, I asked my neighbor Hal where a good place to grab some good grub was. Without hesitation,  he said \"Ross you need to go to the Spoke and Wheel, you're going to wheely like it!\" I gave him a courtesy laugh, rolled my my eyes, and proceeded to drive down to the restaurant.  As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I was promptly seated at a nice table near the patio. What a cool place! I liked the bike theme they have going on all around.  My server (Caitlyn?) was very helpful with food and beer recommendations for me. I told her I was looking for something on the lighter side since my metabolism seems to have halted lately. She recommended a the Veggie Street Tacos. I was skeptical at first as I'm not a fan of just veggie only dishes, but she had nice legs so I decided to trust her. BOOM!!  She hit the nail on the head! The tacos were Amazing!! Plenty of guacamole which I love, and super fresh Pico de gallo, crisp cabbage, and a little bit of creme dressing on top for flavor! I can honestly say I am now a fan of veggie dishes! I was so happy with her recommendation, I asked her to surprise me with dessert.  KAPOW!! She did it again! She brought out some sort of Banana Churro dish and Holy Smokes!! It was so good!! Just writing this is making me want to go back for more. She told me can can bring my dog in there next time which I thought was pretty cool. Thanks Spoke and Wheel, this was a nice welcome for a guy new to the area. It \"Wheely\" is good!"}
{"text":"First time there. Great food! The guacamole was so fresh, I swear the avocado was still growing. I had the steak street tacos. Fantastic! Wasn't a huge fan of the beans, they had great spice but were too watery for me. The chips and guacamole was also great! Friend #1 had the spicy chicken sandwich with sweet potato waffle fries and she raved about it. The portions were very large, easy to split with another person. Friend #2 had the fish street tacos and was just as pleased as me.   Great place, they're having a Halloween party we're now going to attend.  The only downside was the service. The waitress was nice, knowledgeable and did her best. But she was the only server for the bar, patio and dining room. Not at all her fault and she did her very best. Hope she gets at least one more server to help her."}
{"text":"I have been here four times, twice with one friend, and twice with another.  The food is meh.  I had a salad twice and it was good, though not spectacular.     The last visit, we shared an order of the sweet chipotle wings.  They were sweet but the chipotle flavor was so underdone as to be barely noticeable.  The wings were not cold but they were definitely not hot enough temperature wise or spice wise.  All visits were at opening time and every time there was one bartender on duty and no service staff.  Bartender was doing prep work (cutting fruit, stocking) with her back to the room.  Service was very slow and bartender was so focused on prep and set up that it was difficult to get her attention.  For the price, it was an okay deal.  For the service and attention, it was very overpriced.  The last visit sealed the deal.  I will not return."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner and beer before, and signed up for their mailing list.... thought it would be perfect for the advertised Mother's Day Brunch, but I'm sorry to say they did a very poor job of it.    We took my mother-in-law who we don't see very often, and ended up feeling embarrassed.  We had 10:30 reservations, and while it says \"Free Mimosa for Mom\" on arrival, our wasn't even offered a drink.  Our waitress took one drink order right away while the rest of us looked over the cocktail menu, and when she came back about 15 minutes later only brought that drink and one water, the other three of us were left until she made it back another 15 minutes later with waters.  At least give us a glass of water to sip while we wait for the bar orders.  Needless to say now.... but we waited about an hour and 15 minutes for our brunch order, and mine was served to me cold (eggs benedict).  Besides being cold, the eggs were overcooked, and there was barely a spoonful of hollandaise sauce.  I didn't ask the others at the table how theirs was, because it was just to horrible, I didn't want to focus on it.    For happy hour, it's great.  There are good beer choices and you can't go wrong with a burger and fries.  But, please don't go for a special occasion, no matter how enticing their plans seem.  It wasn't worth it.  :("}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, good food and cool place. Good place for a work lunch or to watch a game."}
{"text":"Good variety of drink choices for happy hour.  Ride your bike here and it is always happy hour!!! Dangerous. Lol."}
{"text":"I am adding an update. I went here again last night (okay, I might be an addict).  Yes, as always we rode our bikes along the canal to get here and hitched them up at the bike rack (yes, you have to love a restaurant with a bike rack inside).  We chose spoke and wheel for two reasons: (1) They have a bunch of TV's and we wanted to watch some sports in comfortable booths, and (2) We love their hot dogs and my buddy Dave and I wanted to do a \"dog throwdown.\"  This is the place to do it.  Their sonoran dogs are amazing.  Whooops, I forgot, there is a #3 reason - you get 1/2 off pricing if you ride your bike.   I think most of us are now familiar with the amazing \"Attorney Steve Dog\" (no it's not on the menu and you might get some funny looks if you try to order it) which is a sonoran dog with an impressive mixture of nacho cheese and jalapeno - with a side of bacon to boot.  I know, your mouth is watering right?  Well my buddy Dave has been going on and on about \"Dave's Dog\" which he claims is the best sonoran hot dog in the world, (okay, at least the best dog on Central Avenue in Phoenix....hahahah I had to take him up on that).  Anyway, his dog has nacho cheese, mac & cheese and buffalo sauce on it.  I know, that is a pretty mouth-watering concept and a formidable competitor to the Attorney Steve Dog for sure, so we had to know who's was best.  We decided to conduct a sonoran dog throwdown and ordered a couple Dawgs for some other great folks at the bar (it was a birthday party).  The waitress Jennifer (awesome gal, best we have had) brought the Dave's Dog and the Attorney Steve dog over to the table of guests who were kind enough to help us resolve this pending challenge.  There was a lot of chewing going on, and a lot of back and forth raised eyebrows.   There was also a LOT OF FUN.....which is why we love this place.    If you want to know who the sonoran dog throwdown you will have to watch this video.  https://vimeo.com/75118756  As usual, this was yet another great time at the spoke and wheel.  Jason, the manager is also an awesome dude, and he came out to say hi and to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal adding a real nice touch to the evening.  What kind of sonoran dog can you create at the spoke and wheel?   Keep us posted!  - Attorney Steve -"}
{"text":"I grew up in Phoenix and remember when Spoke and Wheel was Dillion's. After a bad experience at Dillion's I never went back, but decided to try Spoke and Wheel the other night with my boyfriend and we loved it! Mikayla was our server and she was so personable and suggested the fish tacos and the hatch green chili burger with garlic fries and they were amazing! We will definitely be coming back- but will bring our bikes for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I came back on a Saturday afternoon. This time I got a pitcher of beer for $5. A great deal! I had the tacos from the Happy Hour menu and they were very tasty. A pretty good experience."}
{"text":"Walked in here the other night and it might be my new hangout on the Central Corridor. I ordered the black truffle burger and the short rib poutine. Reminded me of the poutine in Vancouver, but way tastier. They had my favorite beer, Stiegl on tap. This place is within walking distance of my house. I love the ambiance."}
{"text":"Came here with four friends, sat at the bar, and pigged out. We ordered deviled eggs, tacos, and mac & cheese. Quite possibly the best combo known to man. A food trifecta.   The food was so delicious we couldn't stop talking about it. We were embarrassingly over excited about eating. My friend exclaimed that we sounded like a bunch of hillbillies who had never been to a restaurant before. It was just so good. The mac & cheese was the best thing I've ever put into my mouth. It was like one big food orgy. It wasn't pretty, but I wasn't on a date ... and if I were, well, I wouldn't change a thing. I would still be moaning with delight and shoving food in my mouth until it was time to go home. Oh, I'm sorry, were we supposed to have a conversation?"}
{"text":"Our first time here, the place was really fun! They are right on the canal and have a happy hour special that if you ride your bike in, you get happy hour prices all day!  The drink I had was great and my friend had tacos and bean soup - the soup was to die for! Their outdoor patio has patio heaters, space for your bicycle, and is dog friendly!  Our waitress was amazing and I can't wait to take my husband there! Recommend!"}
{"text":"Walking up, it doesn't look like something you'd want to go grab a drink at the bar alone at. I almost turned around thinking that it was way more of a sit down restaurant vibe. Trust me that this isn't the case and go in! You go slightly down from the entrance into the CUTEST bar. The bartenders are so nice and down to earth. They're very talented with their cocktail creations.   My favorite part was the wine on tap and sweet potato waffle fries.  After I finished my homework there was live music (on a Thursday!) with a guy that sounded similar to Jack Johnson. I had goosebumps. It was so relaxing and I promise that's not just the wine talking. I brought my \"adult\" zen coloring books and didn't even feel judged.   My recommendation would be to get here at the beginning of happy hour as the bartender(s) get busy closer to the heart and end of happy hour."}
{"text":"It seems like every restaurant and bar concept has been tried at this location but nothing has ever stuck for one reason or another.  This building has been several different bars, several different restaurants, and most recently a Dillon's BBQ restaurant.  Will the newest concept stick?  Well, if it does, they'll need to improve on the quality of the food in my opinion.  My brother and I came here by chance while driving north on Central Avenue.  The place bumps right up against the canal midway between Northern and Dunlap.  The namesake is very much geared toward the many bikers and runners who traverse the historic Murphy Bridle Path from Bethany Home road to where the Path ends right here.  They even give discounts to folks to ride their bike here instead of their cars.  Great way to get patrons in the door.  The interior is pretty roomy (bordering on cavernous) with booths against the wall, a bar, and tables in the middle.  The patio in the back is right up against the canal on one side and Central Ave on the other.  There were flat screen TVs at every booth tuned to football so we went with a booth.  None of the main entrees appealed to me at the time so I actually went with the sausage and soft pretzel platter.  I love sausage and I love pretzels, so why not.  It was served with two different Schreiner's sausages, two small pretzel rolls, a cheese dip and potatoes.  The sausages were very good, though I was disappointed with the portion sizes.  The platter is meant to serve two but I easily took the sausages myself as the portion size was relatively small.  The potatoes I got with the platter were also super dry and tasted like they'd been stuck under a heat lamp for awhile.  The cheese dip was pretty good and was a decent compliment to the pretzel rolls, but not necessarily the sausages.  Overall, the place was sort of meh.  The food was acceptable, but didn't wow me.  The vibe of the restaurant didn't excite me, though this place would work very well as a place to watch the NFL on Sundays with all the TVs they have in there.  And I like the concept of catering to the neighborhood bridle path crowd.  But if my dish was any indication of the rest of their menu, they should focus their improvement efforts on the food."}
{"text":"I will give this another try one day! I ordered their French Onion soup with steak and it was overly salty. I do feel they have many good sandwiches and the service was attentive. It's a large restaurant with an outside patio. I imagine it was a stopping point for those walking or biking on the CAP which is immediately behind the place."}
{"text":"Super impressed. The Mediterranean pasta is amazing. I couldn't get enough. Can't wait to have it again. I didn't leave a crumb on my plate."}
{"text":"Bar service/restaurant sometimes slow in afternoon  Sandwiches/ burgers pretty good  I don't like the layout when you first walk in....old, unfriendly....no one to help you decide where to sit....patio/bar/floor booths  Good deals and choices of food/beer  Comfy booths  Maybe put up old photos of the history of the area, or place mats of old central.....  Bike maps as place mats....  Something is missing every time we go....."}
{"text":"Be glad you got two stars...it definitely was NOT for the service, the waiter, or the portions.  We were really excited to try this place...we had been fans of Dillons and the countless other restaurants in this spot and went with an open mind.  First off, it was noon on Monday and there were only two other tables with customers.  It took forever for service, our waiter was not helpful, in fact, we ordered our appetizer and he assumed we'd want it with our lunch (you know what they say about when you ASS-UME).  We had to ask for silverware - he brought out two of the lunches and did not return with the other two.  He finally brought out one more and totally spaced the fourth.  The portion...another ASSUMption.  My friends did not order lunch portions, they ordered off the regular menu and when we questioned we were told the computer ASSUMES you want lunch.  Communication, caring, personality would have made this such a better experience especially since we live nearby and would love to frequent the place.  Have to say, the food was good.  I LOVED my appetizer,  which came eventually."}
{"text":"Ride your bike in for happy hour anytime!  Happy Hour: good deals Staff & Service: friendly and helpful Atmosphere: calm and pleasant Food: I was pleasantly surprised with the food quality Televisions:  Yes Patio: Yes, very nice patio (smoking area as well if you are in to that sort of thing) Cleanliness:  very clean (your skin won't stick to the tables or the bar top, which is nice) Will I be back:  yes"}
{"text":"From the same folks who brought us Timo just up the street from here, we now how Spoke & Wheel.  I didn't know about this place until last week, and decided to give it a try for lunch.  The exterior is unassuming, but the space inside is clean and spacious.  I like the menu.  Sure, they're $9, but they do have Sonoran Dogs (comes with a side).  Not sure how authentic they are.  They have a fair selection of burgers and sandwiches.  I went with the black truffle burger, which was tasty, and possibly one of the best burgers I have had in Phoenix.  The parmesan garlic fries are excellent as well.    I also really liked how they had several specialty sodas.  I had the ginger hibiscus soda, but I would like to try them all.  I wish more restaurants offered something better than water or crappy fountain drinks for those who want something non-alcoholic.  And all day happy hour if you come on your bicycle?  I don't even ride, but that's pretty awesome.  Spoke & Wheel has good food, and it's a nice, relaxed place to hang out.  Another excellent spot in the North Central neighborhood."}
{"text":"We were Wheeled in by this place;) Very cool! Really liked how open this place felt! Right when you walk in, it just felt so warm and cozy. Tons of seating with a nice large bar on one side. And a large covered patio area outside. We sat inside. It was too hot still to sit on the patio. The lighting was just right. The booth was nice and comfy. They had a nice full bar drink selection. Good Happy Hour prices. We were just there for burgers and soda's that night though. We had the Spoke and Wheel Burger: caramelized onions, jalapeños, cheddar, sweet potato, arugula, sweet chili sauce. It was a good burger with a nice kick. There isn't one thing I didn't enjoy on this burger. It surprisingly went together very well. The other burger we got was the Hatch Green Chili Burger: honey, hatch green chili, pico de gallo, queso anejoenchilado (mexican feta style cheese.) This one was a tad disappointing. Not as much flavor as I was expecting. But still a good burger. We both got the delicious parmesan garlic fries. I look forward to coming back and trying a few new things."}
{"text":"Cool new place in North Central Phoenix!  The space has certainly come a long way from the former restaurant that was here.  Great patio, great service and great drink selection.  This is the kind of place you can see yourself becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"The food is far better than it should be. This place has an amazing patio. It is the best place in the city to be on nice day. Best of all if you go even occasionally the bar tender will remember you. Don't miss out on this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to \"bar food\" place.  Excellent food, especially the burgers and sliders.  The core beer list has been improved recently (still think more Arizona beers would be a plus, but the choices are good) and there are always great guest taps to choose from.  Arizona wine on tap too is also a huge plus.  Fantastic happy hour deals as well.  Great pub atmosphere, great patio."}
{"text":"Felt the good was fair as well as the service however the prices were too high for bar type food.  They ran out of the orange blossom beer which was disappointing."}
{"text":"Great place to check out!  We tried the French dip sandwich and the green chili burger and they were both great.  I'd definitely be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, flashback. Used to go there when it was \"The Top of Central.\" Stopped in with some people and I must be honest to help others that may want to visit and eat here.  First, nice staff, on point with us, taking the orders and such. The place had less than 30 people in it and it took quite a long time to get out dinner, not that big of a deal. Most of us ordered burgers and fries, which is about $15.00 each. Here's the important parts. $15.00 for a burger and fries? The bun was enormous and the burger wasn't anything special. The fries come in a basket and we're also small in portion for the $15.00 price. Trust me, it's definitely not worth the price!!!!! Even the French Dip was 15.00 and that wasn't anything special either. After reviewing the menu we all agreed the prices are to high, exaggerated for the portions and it definitely wasn't anything tasty.   Save your money, time and effort...Go to Fuddruckers, Red Robin or even Smashburger"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out ever since I moved to my new apartment and I'm so glad I did! I came out on a Tuesday so it wasn't too busy, but it quickly filled up for Trivia Night! We did not sign up but my friend and I participated in the background which was still fun. The annoying part of trivia night was that they would ask the question and then would play a whole song or 2 in between, hence it lasting 2 hours. But this was my first trivia night, so maybe this is quite common.   My friend and I shared two shared plates which was a great idea. We shared the Nachos and the Pig and pretzel plate. The pretzel plate was my favorite! It had lots of variety and plenty of food which I find hard to find when ordering a board like that. It had 2 large sausages, 3 pretzel balls, plenty of cheese, mustard, and 2 ribs. The menu was HUGE and didn't even have the chance to look at it all the other options because I was so hungry.   I would definitely want to check this place out on another night, there were plenty of TVs to watch sports and the booths were super comfy to sit in!!!"}
{"text":"Such a fun atmosphere. The outside patio is great if you bring your dog or just want to sit outside.  Great food and awesome service."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Jay took good care of us. The craft beer and happy hour appetizers were great. We ordered the wings and they were done just right - not greasy at all. They have indoor and outdoor (with misters) seating. A perfect place to stop for a drink and snack. Thank you!"}
{"text":"We had a little confusion about mimosas at breakfast. The manager worked everything out for us which was much appreciated. Thanks :)"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more. I actually know an owner/partner, but I am not a name dropper trying to get better service. I do like the burgers and Sonoran hot dog. I had a delicious perfect mojito. It's just the service could use a nudge in the right direction. I WILL get a second mojito if you ask me. I WILL order chocolate cake, if you offer it. I DO like to be checked on a few times. I DONT like overly attentive service at a casual restaurant like Spoke and Wheel, but really, YOU add to YOUR tip and total if you serve me, or offer to. Just ask. You know, they say you might get ten NOs for every YES.  But then you get that yes. Please do try Spoke and Wheel. I think you'll like the food."}
{"text":"We chose Spoke & Wheel for our company Christmas party... WOW... did they take good care of us. There are few places that have large banquet space available... space for up to 30.  The banquet room was fully decorated, and made formal with linen tablecloths and napkins, they even printed a custom menu for us.  Even with their most modest price point, the food and service was absolutely 5-STAR... Today is the day after the party, and my crew is still talking about how good the dinners tasted. Additionally, we had appetizers and dessert.  Our event was just about 3-hours and included a cocktail hour too.  When considering a restaurant, where a private room is necessary - and modest cost is a must; I would say look first at Spoke & Wheel... You'll be delighted with your choice."}
{"text":"My husband and i have wanted to come here for a while... Im sad that our experience was so \"meh\".   The place had a couple tables, maybe 6 and a few people at the bar. We sat at a table along the wall looking towards the bar. I thought the TVs were kind of awkwardly placed.... I couldn't really see the ones on the opposite side, and i was sitting under the ones closes to me. I made it work. Our server came over for a drink order, he barely said hello, kinda making us feel like we were inconveniencing him. Drinks were just ok. My husband ordered a margarita, he said it was ok. The issue i have with that was, he ordered it with out salt, as he does EVERY time. Our server brought it out with salt on it and when he spoke up about it, the server looked at his book and snatched the glass off the table. All they did was wipe the salt off with a bar napkin, pushing all the salt to the bottom and dumped it into a new glass,  so basically he had a margarita mixed with salt. All my drink was, was syrup. We moved on. The plan was to have a big enough meal that we would not eat dinner (it was like 3) and watch some football. We started off with the wings, since it was our first time there we wanted to try a couple flavors. When we ordered half chipotle bbq and half sweet buffalo, our server said \"yeah, i'll see if they'll do that\".... As if was difficult for the kitchen, I've never heard of a sports-type bar declining that request. The description of the wings was definitely better than the actual flavor... we still ate them. My husband also ordered the guacamole and chips, that was terrible. Tasted like that fake, store bought holy guacamole. We decided to not have dinner. Neither of us were really excited about anything on the menu, since our appetizers fell flat.   We may come back... its not close enough for us to really go out of our way though."}
{"text":"Love the burgers at spoke. They grill them on a wood fire grill. Service is always friendly and the atmosphere is stellar. My local hang out spot"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and ordered the sandwich, soup, salad. Everything was very good. The salad was very good and the chicken soup was tasty. I would definitely order the same plate again. The burgers looked great, will be back to order a burger again soon. The place was really nice, music was a little loud, but it was a great atmosphere. I'll come back and order a signature cocktail next time as well, they sounded very good."}
{"text":"Severely understaffed... No greeting at the door, just a sign stating to seat yourself... But the bartender... Hardest working kid I've seen. Patio, dining room and bar he's covering it all... Too a while to get my drink but he apologized numerous times and it wasn't for lack of effort on his part.   I sat at the bar and there was a lot of visible inventory, the bar stock is in the wide open? Just kinda weird  Now... The food... Killer, came out fairly fast (it was afternoon mid week) and was great! I was pleasantly surprised to say the least! I got the Hatch Burger and garlic fries both were fantastic. That said, if you don't LOVE garlic beware of the garlic fires.   Overall great spot, super bike friendly as the name eludes to, the place just needs management to support the staffing. It's also possible that I may have just caught it on a bad day? There was a large party so who knows?"}
{"text":"My roommate and I love this place! I stumbled on this gem by sifting through yelp and I couldn't be happier. I live a mile away, and since my first visit a month ago I've been back probably 4-5 times. The brunch menu is DELICIOUS, the drinks are BOMB (especially when they're half off), and the blackened chicken sandwich is my current go to menu item. I tried the calamari my first time and couldn't get enough. Highly recommend !!! I'm surprised this place isn't busier honestly."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is really great , got the Cuban  with garlic kale and it was really good. I'm not a French fry guy but they are amazing too. Love the old building and the outdoor seating is perfect and relaxing. Great spot off central!!"}
{"text":"Reggie our server was great, the atmosphere was t too uptight and it wasn't super relaxed it was perfect. The burgers and beer hr deal they have going on is fantastic."}
{"text":"I WISH we lived closer. We live in Gilbert and specifically come here for the nachos, the French dip, the entire brunch menu, the atmosphere, and amazing service...every time! We had Emma today and she is SO nice! I am not sure how this place finds and keeps the best staff but they do and I am sure grateful that they do. Oh...and no matter what playlist they have on...the music here is the best!"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood & frequent the place 2-3 times a month. We stopped in for easter/Sunday brunch and couldn't have been happier. Caitlyn has served us almost ever time we've visited and she's amazing, she even had ice water waiting for the dog! Patio friendly, dog friendly, and amazing service! Great place to be!"}
{"text":"This is such a great gem for our neighborhood!  We love to stop in for a beer and some yummy street tacos."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a Friday night. It was pretty busy but not overly congested. Featured a pleasant mix of local neighborhood folks of all ages with families and groups taking up the booths and tables and singles/couples saddling up to the bar area. It seemed like they were short on waitstaff, and although my server was friendly, she and the other waiters/waitresses appeared a bit frazzled with all the running around they had to do. The food was quite tasty, especially the sausage and soft pretzel platter which is suitable for sharing with a pal. Will definitely try this spot again."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short  -   Great wine selection -    DELICIOUS fish & chips with an interesting red trout instead of the flavorless white     flaky stuff you're used to -  Fries weren't crispy enough, but they had a nice flavor, and didn't seem like the came from frozen taters -  chocolate cake was really boring -  food took a long time for an empty restaurant -  very friendly service -  It was empty, but it was a Tuesday night at 9pm  I'd definitely go back again, and I hope they work out their kinks described by others.   It is a shame the place is so big. It feels kind of awkward. I think it would be more cozy & inviting if they closed off the southern side of the restaurant for private parties, or at least until the place picks up, and can fill the big space."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! I loved the feel of the establishment! The food was amazing.  I opted for the namesake burger, the spoke and wheel and I was not disappointed! The beer prices and happy hour were great and not to mention the selection.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Food: Great. Music (David Sheehy): Great Air conditioning: Meh. If the temperature was cooler I would spend a heckuva lot more time here!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. My service group (Metro Civitan) meets here monthly and we are very happy to be here.  Wish I lived close enough to bike there."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I went there for the first time for happy hour on Saturday afternoon. Had appetizers and a couple of their krafted cocktails.  Had the Deviled Eggs, Chicken Chirizo Nachos, Grilled Calamari. Excellent and very delicious.  Their prices are very good and the food very fresh and tasty.  Love what they did to the decor.  Very open and inviting. The Bar Tender Brian was excellent. Great service.  So glad they are close to where I live.  Another great place to go in the neighborhood.  Cant wait to go back and try their burgers and sandwiches and more.  A big thumbs up!!  If you havent been you must go. Definately recommend. :)"}
{"text":"First time this afternoon for lunch. It was five of us and we all ordered something different. Blackened Chicken Sandwich: My husband says it was the best ever. I tasted it and it was wow! The hatch chilies on it were so so fantastic. Son had the steak and onion soup baked with gruyere cheese. I tasted that too and it was WOW!!!! Cousin had a Tuna Burger with parmesan fries! I tasted it as well. Perfect size bun! Amazing flavors! That was WOW as well. Nephew had the Fish and chip and he loved it. No I did not taste his. I had the chicken wings that were awesome. Cousin had the Sangria which she loved. Son had the Happy Hour Malbec which he liked as well. This is where we are going for Super Bowl. Tired of going to sports bars with bad food. Reasonable pricing as well!"}
{"text":"Garbage best describes this restaurant. Chicken wings came out raw, when I informed the bar tender who appeared to be high on something he quickly took them back to the kitchen and brought me a new order. On top of it I had to pay for them what a joke. Place sucks, save your time and money. Should of known by the looks on the outside, dirty, dark, and 3 cars in the parking lot. The owner has no pride in this place and it shows. Garbage!!!!"}
{"text":"So we're here again after riding the Bridal Path with the kids then the Canals.   I can't tell you how much I love the music, service, patio (we brought the dog and they have dog bowls) and the \"bike riding\" discount. The menu makes me so happy. Full bar and drink selection is amazing. This place has it ALL."}
{"text":"We love Spoke & Wheel but every time we're on the patio someone is smoking freaking nasty cigarettes and it just totally ruins the vibe."}
{"text":"I very much appreciated my first time here. The food was good and the bartender was cool. It's definitely a locals-neighborhood spot. Met some wonderful people"}
{"text":"Another beautiful Sunday morning on the patio at Spoke and Wheel! This has become our weekend morning go to after a long walk on either the Murphy Bridal Trail or Arizona canal which both connect right to this wonderful neighborhood eatery! You can ride on in on your bikes, or bring your dogs after a good walk and eat on the charming patio! Food is fantastic and the servers and staff couldn't be more friendly! Emma sees us coming and already knows to start our order!! She is a gem!! I can tell you everything we have ever had at Spoke and wheel is fabulous! Best burgers in town hands down! Today was Chorizo breakfast tacos! Delish!!! See you again next weekend Spoke and wheel!"}
{"text":"Surprised & Delighted!  We drove past on Sunday and decided we had to check the place out. We've been to all the previous establishments at this location and liked the look of its latest incarnation. We invited some friends to join us there last night. After looking at their menu on line and reading some of the reviews we almost changed our mind about going but are so happy that we did. We like what they have done with the interior and the patio. We chose to sit on the patio since it was so nice. Our friends got there first and had ordered a $5 pitcher and white sangria's. The White Sangria's were out of this world. Also, the Happy Hour menu was pretty good. $6 for a bowl of mussels? Crazy. I ordered the ahi tuna street tacos and loved them. They came with a side of beans which were great. My husband ordered the Fish & Chips with the charred kale as a side. The kale was fabulous. Our friends ordered the cactus salad which was interesting, though not my favorite. Nice that they have several types of fries. We got the sweet potato waffle fries which were pretty good. For dessert we decided to try the banana churro and were not disappointed. Very tasty. The service was pretty good though it took the waitress quite a while to come back after she dropped off our check. They also didn't have a few of the beers that my husband was hoping to order. Otherwise, everything was spot on and we will be back in the future."}
{"text":"One of my favorite end of bike ride stops. (BTW its happy hour at all times if you arrive via bike) The owner/operator is connected with cycling in some way. Note the art work composed of bike parts, jerseys etc. You can literally ride in to the out door section where the bike rack is inside the enclosure.   Food here is upscale bar food. The deviled eggs with bacon and truffle oil are great!! Great beer selection. Super friendly service. This place has a local central corridor following and is often crowded.  Do go here and ride your bike!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere Great!  However one of the worst meals I have had in Phoenix. I had the chicken tenders. For $11.50 I thought they would be decent size tenders but no they were small. 2nd the tenders had no flavor and on top of that were tough. My friends burger looked good IF I go back maybe the burger will be better."}
{"text":"The best way to spend a Sunday morning if you ask me! Ride there, safe bike parking, good quality beer for cheap, quick service and a fun location. I'm a cyclist through and through so this was right up my alley."}
{"text":"I have tried this place multiple times. It is terrible. I have never had a good dish. The food is too salty or too bland. Terrible."}
{"text":"I love this place! The space itself is beautifully designed both on the inside and on the patio. The food was delicious and service was great.    The receptionist was great about setting up a reservation for my group of 30. They were prepared when we got there and took great care of the group as a whole. I loved that they have a bike rack inside on the patio so you can see your bike while you eat ;) delicious beers and all day happy hour to cyclists!!!! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere, comfortable seating, phenomenal service.  I loved my experience here and truly appreciated the attentiveness of our server.  I had order a tart mixed drink so when my side of sautéed garlic kale came out, it just wasn't mixing well. I didn't bring this up with the server since it was a \"me\" issue but when he noticed the uneaten side he went out of his way to fix it. Truly a neat place."}
{"text":"Calimari, avocado/chips, San tan are the best mixture.   See Aaron he'll hook you up,"}
{"text":"My first time here. It was busier than expected but highly understaffed. I waited 15 minutes until I could even get someone to even come to the table. I am writing this as I'm sitting here at the restaurant and everyone at my table has recieved their food except myself.    *edit* the manager was very helpful. The food was absolutely delicious. Our drinks were awesome and definitely hit the spot. My family and I will be back in the future."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on a warm Saturday afternoon. We sat in a booth inside. The restaurant was clean and the music selection playing was great! Caitlyn was our server. She was so friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and suggested the crispy chicken sandwich. It was exactly what I wanted! The food was delicious and Caitlyn's service was superb! We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Came In with my fiancé for a casual date night - Caitlyn was our waitress and she was excellent!!!! Cheese burger with sweet potato waffle fries (amazing). We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. We come once a week with our 1 year old daughter and it's a great family atmosphere with good food and great service. Also, great place to catch a game."}
{"text":"Add being a fan of the fish sandwich to the list! Frank's red hot sauce, coleslaw and chipotle aioli top tender white fish on a brioche bun ($11.85) and the Parmesan garlic fries, while devastating for your breath, are also devastatingly delicious!"}
{"text":"Great find! Might become my new neighborhood bar. Good happy hour until 6pm with decent beers on tap. Hard to beat the lunch specials and burger/pitcher happy hour deals."}
{"text":"Great, diverse menu!  I live in the neighborhood and make this a weekly destination.  I love the sides especially the kale, parmesan garlic fries, and Mac n cheese.  I have been for brunch and loved the bloody Mary bar.  The sausage plate and deviled eggs are excellent, we order them all the time! The steak and French onion soup is spot on too!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars   I like this place because of the laid back atmosphere.  Its good dive restaurant and bar.  The Sonoran dog, the ahi tuna burger, buffalo wings, steak street tacos, guacamole and chips are all good easy choices."}
{"text":"This is NOT a bad three star review. Actually it's quite the opposite. First of all. I am an avid biker. And I LOVE the bike friendly theme. And they provide anyone who rides a bike here happy hour prices all day, any day. AWESOME! While the food isn't the best I've ever had it is a solid 'good' and a well executed bar type offering. Well done Spoke and Wheel! A fun place to check out for sure!"}
{"text":"Hang in there, Spoke & Wheel. You are misproving what we all have been (gulp) silently wondering: When will you close your doors?  Everyone else failed in that location?  Hands-down they have figured out some great things with their business plan.  Inviting those pedaling by to stop in for Happy Hour deals ANYTIME when you ride your bike.  Oh, and happy hour? Great deals especially if you like street tacos (the beans are SO FREAKING GOOD!), burgers, and attractively-priced craft pitchers.  Keep it up, crew, nice to see your audience grow and we'll keep supporting!"}
{"text":"First, the good. Spoke & Wheel offers deals for those who ride their bike to the restaurant. This is a fun way to get there and you get some exercise to and from the restaurant. I'd love if more places did this kind of thing.   As much as I want to like Spoke & Wheel it's honestly nothing special. For an appetizer, Chips and Guacamole were okay, the chips are thin flimsy plain Tostito's type chips with your run of the mill guacamole.   I got mushroom burger, which was the only veggie burger on the menu. It was fine but the sweet potato fries I ordered with it were sparse and average. I don't get why some restaurants serve ketchup with sweet potato fries, like.. come on. They don't go together. It's the small things like the chips you get with guac, the fries you get with a burger, the bun of your burger that can make a place seem like they care about their product, and that is where this place lacks.   Although there are a lot of televisions in the dining area, they aren't positioned well to be easy to watch. The booths lining the wall are a half circle shape, with televisions on the wall above the table. So really the only people who can see the closest tv are the people on the ends of the booths. It is seat yourself, so if you decide to go, just make sure to pick a table or a seat that you can easily watch tv from, because many spots are the equivalent to obstructed view seats in a stadium.  If you're going to this place on bike to get a couple beers and drunk food, yeah that would be an okay idea. If you're going to this place with hopes of enjoying a quality meal or trying to impress a date, I'd pass."}
{"text":"Awesome place in the city, especially for cyclists! We rode here with a group from Rio Vista park and were thrilled to find the outdoor patio with lots of bike parking and a waiter who kept the water pitcher full! The burger was great as was all of the other food. This is an awesome biking destination. My only real complaint was that the misters outside were a little overambitious- all of the food at the table was wet within a minute or two."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. A lot better than it looks from the outside. Laid back. Good Moscow mules and good food. Recommend the hatch chili burger, mussels, and homemade pumpkin pie."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with two of my friends for a going away dinner. After reading the good reviews, we were excited. The food was terrible. My friend ordered the truffle bacon burger, and it came with only bacon. I got the Gorgonzola apple salad and it had no bacon, the dressing was watery, and the chicken was undercooked. The service was terrible. There was one server for the whole restaurant and there was a large party so it was ok for it to be slow, but we were literally at the restaurant for an hour and a half. The server was unapologetic and it took him 5 minutes to greet us. We will not be back. Guac was brown and also a disappointment. It tasted like it came from a tub."}
{"text":"Very good food, had an awesome burger and they have happy hour all day! Until 6 in the restaurant and after 6 at the bar - great deals. Also great patio and area all around!"}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible service. The only restaurant i have ever eaten at where they brought my food then ten minutes later the appetizer for the table.   Only eat here if you can deal with hipster waitress rolling their eyes at you"}
{"text":"Great patio, but they need a stout on the beer menu and the kitchen needs to learn how to cook and season food.  We ordered a pitcher of beer, it was cold with chilled glasses!  It was happy hour so we ordered the sonoran hot dog and the jalapeno poppers.  The hot dog and fries were good, but not hot (temperature).  The poppers were barely grilled, like eating a raw jalapeno.  Very HOT!! We couldn't get anyone's attention, so went to the bar to get water.  The waitress had the poppers taken off the bill and we ordered calamari.  It didn't have the golden color that make it appealing and it was VERY greasy, plus it didn't have any seasoning.  A little salt and pepper go a long way.  Like we said the manager took the poppers off our bill, but we didn't have the heart to send the calamari back too.  Bottom line; nice place we will stop for a beverage, but the food will keep us heading up the street!"}
{"text":"I am a fan -- especially in patio weather when you can sit outside with your dogger. This spot excels at lunch IMO -- brunch still has some growing to do. I love their soups, sammys, and salads. You can't go wrong with any of them. Decent lunch time HH as well."}
{"text":"Great food. I order happy hour black mussels and chicken tacos. Tacos were good, black mussels were awesome! Husband had the Fire something calamari pasta, was also awesome!   Hamburger are also very good. I would definitely tell friends and family to check it out. I would also return."}
{"text":"Went there for Easter brunch and was not thrilled.   First, my friend came into the restaurant about two weeks earlier to make the reservation and specifically requested to be seated in the patio but when I was the first to arrive they sat us inside.   Second, the room was very smoky from the grill outside two feet from the door. My eyes started burning from the smoke and when I got home, my clothes smelled of smoke, and we weren't even that close to the door.   Third, the food was only mediocre for the price and the desserts looked like they were store bought and the server didn't know what flavor the cakes were.   Overall, I'd consider trying the restaurant again but wasn't thrilled in their performance for this Easter brunch."}
{"text":"First time stopping into Spoke & wheel..  first impression was its a nice setup with a good happy hour deal that kept us there for a second pitcher. The server was excellent and was definitely on top of everything. Thats very refreshing. Some places you wish you had some flares to light ..not the case here. My food was also spot on. Let me go into detail about how happy I was that my burger was cook perfect med. This doesnt happen very often when the gf orders hers well done. Both came out as ordered. Great tasting and great fries! Now the reason for the 3 stars. Cleanliness.. please clean your light fixtures.. they are full of dust and bugs and its a very big turn off. This is not a few weeks worth..this is years worth of grime. I hope you spend more care in cleaning the kitchen and to be honest the only reason we have not been back. You did everything right except make sure to clean. The thought of a dirty kitchen is whats kept us away..because if you dont care in the dining room..most likely the practice is the same behind the closed doors. I wish this business the best.. we will be back in a few weeks..if its still dirty. It will be our last time in"}
{"text":"Awesome meal. Seated quickly, entertaining with Trivia night. Great atmosphere. Enjoyed our experience. Best meal this trip.  Would recommend to anyone and will return.  Wood fired cheeseburger and excellent chili lime wings."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times now - all for dinner and usually up at the bar. Why this place is five stars for me:  1) Probably the best and most consistent service I've had in Phoenix so far. The waitstaff is very quick to greet you, quick to take orders, and the food is always fast. Never have had to wait for anything.  2) The food that we have tried is incredible. Burgers are the best I've had in Phoenix to date. The mussels, calamari, and salads are great. Great happy hour specials and good beer selection on tap.  3) Atmostphere. Nice sized bar. Clean, up to date. TV's EVERYWHERE. This is a great place to catch a game. I've only been here on week nights, but I've never had to wait for a spot at the bar or a table."}
{"text":"Fun neighborhood bar and restaurant.   I have been to Spoke and Wheel at least once or twice a month since July of 2015.    Location: north central. The parking is easy, in a lot to the south of the restaurant.   Food: The food is OK. I eat mostly vegetarian and have been able to find foods. The tomato soup was surprisingly decent, and the pretzels/cheese are OK. The vegetable side dishes have been tasty though a bit overly oily.   Service: fast and friendly *usually*. However, sometimes it takes forever to get checks.    Events: This particular location has Team Trivia on Saturdays evenings at 6pm.  They do take reservations, and I am often editing the reservations since our group ranges from seven to 15 people at any given Saturday.  The Team Trivia hosts have changed almost every time I attend, but it's easy and free to play."}
{"text":"We had dinner here with a big group of people. This is a sports bar type place with a ton of TVs and games on. I thought the place was really nicely decorated inside. We ordered wings + chicken fingers and a couple draft beers. The happy hour was pretty good and the pitcher of beer was really cheap! The wings were great but the chicken fingers were just okay. Oh but the fries were soo good! I'd definitely come back. The outside patio is lit up nicely too!"}
{"text":"This place has nothing to do with real cycling. They use spoke and wheel as marketing tool. It's just another dive bar. So if you're looking for place with going of cycling attitude or culture of cyclist, this is not the place. Just another bar..."}
{"text":"I saw a rep from Spoke and Wheel on a morning TV show last week and it sounded like the place to be, so I quickly bookmarked it.  We stopped in on a Saturday afternoon and we expected it to be a lot more busy than it was.  They have a huge dog friendly patio where you can park your bike while you eat.  The inside feels very cave-like and home-y.  We sat at the bar, which meant that we could take advantage of happy hour food and drink specials even though it wasn't quite time for food specials to go into effect.  The drink specials are some of the best in the valley.  A pitcher that yields at least 2.5 pints for only $5?!  Sign me up.  the red sangria for $5 was amazing too.    My hubby and I both ordered side salads to start.  My only critique is that the salad bowls were so small and so full that I was dumping stuff all over the bar.  The bowls were far too small for the salad in them.  I ordered the Ahi tuna sandwich and cole slaw and my hubby got an Italian sausage Panini with macaroni and cheese.  We both really liked what we ordered.    The bartender was very friendly and attentive.  The music that played in the main restaurant/bar area was so good that my hubby thought they had stolen his iPod!  The whole experience was great.  We now wish we lived close enough to ride our bikes there and get happy hour all day!"}
{"text":"This place needs more servers during busy times like trivia on Saturdays. It's At least a 20 minute wait if you need anything at your table from one of the TWO servers in this room of 60 people. Definitely not enough service to keep things running ok. Food is good though. Drinks are watered down for sure.  Update- went back thinking \"maybe someone had called in that night and they were doing the best they can\" and regretted it a second time. It was a minimum of a 20 minute wait for a drink and it wasn't nearly as crowded as the last time I went. I ended up ordering a bottle of wine so that I wouldn't have to deal with the service every time I needed a new drink."}
{"text":"I went to spoke to watch the football game and had the Andouille  hash for breakfast and the peel and eat shrimp for an app. The whole experience from the food, the staff, and the atmosphere was great from the moment I walked in till the time I left. Can't beat the price for pitchers of craft beer! I will be recommending this bar to my friends and I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for bike riders. Not only is it right off the canal and easily accessible, but they let you take your bike inside to park while you eat. The brunch menu is really well and has a good breakfast:lunch variety. I would defiantly recommend stoping by for bite as well as drink or two."}
{"text":"I visited Spoke & Wheel today for the first time, and it did not disappoint. For starters, their menu has quite the impressive selection. It has tacos,  soups,salads, sandwiches, burgers, ribs, Carne asada plate and the list goes on. I came in craving tacos today, so I had their street tacos and though the 3 taco platter was about 10 bucks, I must say there were no regrets. I tried their hoki fish tacos, their steak tacos, and their braised short rib tacos and I have no complains about any of them. The ingredients were fresh, everything was well cooked and the flavors on each had a tasty, refreshing balance.  Also, the service I had was phenomenal. I was seated and had my drink within 2-3 minutes of my arrival. Then the food took no longer than 10 minutes after ordering.  I will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and eager! There were a couple of mix ups- wrong side, asked for ranch twice but all in all a good experience.  Most of the food was delish. I had the wedge and it was perfect. My husband had the black truffle burger which was supreme. Our daughter had the chicken strips which were dry, however- hence the additional ranch needed.  I do feel it is slightly over priced, but I would still come back, just stick to the more reasonably priced items."}
{"text":"We were looking for something new. We found it. The sweet potato fries reviews brought us in, my wife loves good sweet potato fries she was not disappointed. She had the roasted tomato soup for starters. It was very good, you could taste the tomato, not overpowered with cream. The spicy fish  sandwich topped it off. I had the Cuban Torta with Mac & Cheese. The sandwich was a mouthful of different tastes in every bite. Mac and cheese could have made a meal out of that with a larger portion. A new Phoenix stop."}
{"text":"Holy mother of God, I think I've had my worst restaurant experience...ever! Tonight we decided to try out the new Spoke and Wheel restaurant. Their signage and billboards looked promising and my friends and I like to try new places. I almost didn't post this, but the longer I thought about it, the more aggravated I got. For the record...I really, really wanted to like this place.   Here's the rundown of my experience. Upon entering the restaurant I could tell there was something wrong. The parking lot was empty, along with a whole dining room, but there was a 20-minute wait for a table. Now, I may not own a restaurant, but I am pretty sure they make money by turning tables. The first round of drinks took almost 30 minutes to get to us (including water). Secondly, I was not able to order my burger the way I wanted because it was not the half-pound burger. What?! Another almost 30 minutes later our food is dropped off. I say \"dropped off\" because it was literally placed in front of us and that was it. While we ate, we started seeing guys going around the dining room and start taking tables and chairs outside. We watched and watched as they emptied the whole floor leaving the perimeter booths full (and not served) and isolated two tables of customers to the middle of the floor. Awkward! The whole time we watched them clear the floor we were never asked to have our drinks refilled, if our food was OK...nothing. When the server finally came back to the table after we had eaten, I asked what was going on to find out there was a big, reserved party being set up. My experience as a new customer, at a new restaurant, was cut short because they were too busy setting up for other customers? It just seemed to me they would have been better off having the host start seating the totally empty dining room earlier rather than keep filling the one that was going to be used for the party. As it came time to pay our check the slowness worsened. It took as long to pay the check as it did to order and eat our meal! After finally being able to pay I stopped at the front to see if I could get a card to speak to the owner. The owner was there and I explained that I thought it was a bit rude and classless to start emptying a dining room around customers because of improper management planning. It might have been a better idea to have the crew clearing the floor helping the servers getting customers cashed out BEFORE taking all the furniture out. All I got was the standard \"let me make it up to you\" response like I was going to come back. As I looked outside, I saw 4 busloads of 20-somethings in atrocious clothing surging the front door (which was now totally blocked by the crowd). Pretty sure that is a fire hazard. I didn't take the free meal we were going to get on principle alone. They can have their other customers who will accept that sort or service (and I blame for making this kind of thing acceptable) while I go other places more appreciative of my business. Like I wrote on my credit card draft \"I AM NEVER COMING BACK\"!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It takes any new establishment to get the kinks out but personally speaking, I've had only great service and food here.  They could expand the happy hour menu a bit but other than that, I think the place is awesome."}
{"text":"Came for weekday lunch. Place was pretty empty. They had  weird screamo music on, which was odd.   The food was fine but not memorable. There was a lot of salt in the soup. I got shrimp tacos, they were good.   Very average food, service and ambiance."}
{"text":"We've been here several times. Both as a large party and small. The service was so slow. At first we thought it was the size of our party but when we e been back as just a party of two, the service was still horrendously slow. The food wasn't good enough to warrant the slow service and price. We stopped going here."}
{"text":"Always always good food, drinks, and service.  We go a lot and what keeps us returning is the wine on tap (Nobilo!), beer selections, and excellent food.  The street tacos are super flavorful and you can mix and match your filling:  chicken chorizo, fish, veggies, and one other choice.  The side beans are good too.  Everything I've ever ordered is high end with good rich flavors.  I also appreciate the deep booths, outdoor seating, bloody mary bar, mussels, guacamole, and menu variety.  I have never had a bad experience with any dish or drink order.  It's also fun to ride your bike in, park your bike on the patio, and drink a bit on a nice sunny day."}
{"text":"I'll go back, if only for the steak and onion soup. A little pricey @ $6.95 for the portion, but they're not using crappy gristly meat like you find in soup too often, and the flavor was great. My green chile burger was insane good, cooked just medium rare (YAY) and HUGE.   Service, meh. It was a very slow late Sat. afternoon, 2:30-ish, no big crowds, but took a long time, and then the order was wrong. So we waited some more--lucky we had that yummy soup!   Half way thru the meal, and a hazard of course of being outside, a big honeybee landed on Mom's salad. Hmmmmmmmmm. So we pushed the salad aside after trying to swat if off. The server just said OMG and took the plate. Am I wrong in thinking well, maybe get us a half serving or something, or offer a free dessert?   There seemed to be a LOT of servers for such a quiet time, but it didn't improve the service. Oh well.   That said, I'll go back--lovely sitting outside, and there were some damn fine looking options on the menu that I'd love to try."}
{"text":"We freakin love this place! We take advantage of the all day happy hour pricing when you ride you bike in and nosh on the street tacos, truffle burger, and steak salad. YUM. We come here at least once a week and it's the first place we bring our out of town guests. I only wish they stayed open later so we could grab a beer after our night rides up in the PMP!"}
{"text":"Caitlyn was great! She recommended the fish and chips and I loved them. I love sitting on the patio... great atmosphere. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have driven past this restaurant many times and finally decided to stop for lunch. The food is great. My sister had the fish and chips which were excellent. The coleslaw was really, really good. I had the ahi tuna burger...it was wonderful. We will definitely go back again...soon!"}
{"text":"My rating is based on this being a fun neighborhood joint.  It's probably not my first choice for foodies or a romantic dinner.  Having said that, I love this place.  Biking there is a blast.  I thought the food was excellent, the kids also enjoyed their meal.  I read some of the reviews regarding service, on our two visits there so far service was excellent.  I think this place is a gem."}
{"text":"We come here all the time and we love it! Great neighborhood restaurant that we bring all of our out of town guests too! We love to also come here and play trivia on Saturdays. Michelle has been our server a couple of times and she's always so friendly! Can't say enough good things about this place!"}
{"text":"Great place ! Great staff! Shannon was my server and she was absolutely the best I could ask for ! The food was amazing!Exactly what I asked for! The price is decent not terrible, definitely worth it though no doubt !"}
{"text":"Was here for trivia for the first time tonight. The visit started with an interaction with a disinterested hostess who begrudgingly cleaned a table for us and seated us. We sat for a while until we heard a manager trying to figure out who our server was and why our order wasn't then yet. He was pleasant and took our order himself. We received a couple more passing snide glances from the hostess as she walked by. Mike the trivia guy was fun and the food ( we ordered appetizers) was decent. The atmosphere was good. Overall, a middle of the road rating. They could do better- maybe start with teaching that rude hostess how to smile and feign interest in customers."}
{"text":"This place is great. Casual good food. The food is \"fancy bar food\" as our waiter described it but I consider it a nice good restaurant that happens to have tv's for watching sports and good food. I love the mocktails! House made non-alcoholic beverages that are so yummy; like a mixed drink without the alcohol for those of us who don't inbibe. I've been here at least 3 times and everytime I bring someone they're pleasantly surprised. Don't let their outdoor appearance fool you. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Monday June 29th at 12:34 we came here to eat lunch and apparently the air conditioning isn't working but not one person considered putting a sign up on the front door informing guests about this or even maybe being informed by a waitress that the air conditioning isn't working so maybe consider eating else where.. Nothing nada. We sit down to eat and wonder why it's so hot we ask the waitress and she tells us how the air isn't working. Cool wish we would have known that before we walked in...  We order food and I ordered a quesadilla that was smothered in some sort of chipotle sauce like the chef was fucking sauce happy. Which made it hella soggy.(gross) idk how the fuck this place has such good reviews on yelp. Maybe this place has a better chef at night. Who knows but one things for sure I wont be coming back here. Maybe when they can get their shit together.."}
{"text":"I was there for a group meeting. I ordered the steak and cheese soup. It was delicious. Too much cheese for my taste but that did not deter from the flavor."}
{"text":"Service lacking.  They were removing tables and chairs before food arrived. Waitress asked several times what we ordered.  Cool place but need basic customer service training.  Mgmt and team."}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch and were thrilled to find out that they were pet friendly.  We had been waiting to try it until they had finished their outdoor patio remodel. They did a great job on the remodel and the day was perfect. Our server was attentive and helpful. The menu had a great selection of dishes at very reasonable prices. I had the French Dip and my wife had the Soup, Salad and Half Sandwich. The plating made the food look really good and we were pleased to find out that it really was delicious. We'll definitely be back with our dog many times. Thanks."}
{"text":"What a great spot. Stopped by on a Friday for a late lunch and it was happy hour. The happy hour menu has some tasty bites and a couple of entires. Little pitchers of beer are $7. Had a burger and the GF had fish tacos. All were tasty and can't complain.   The spoke and wheel has a great vibe, reasonable prices and cold beer. Really what more could you ask for in a local pub?"}
{"text":"Very relaxed, friendly atmosphere. Great brews and food. Awesome customer service and best of all they are super dog friendly"}
{"text":"Happy hour prices all day if you ride your bike. Pretty cool.  What's better?  The food and drinks.   A wide selection of craft beer/wine and full bar, many tvs, and a comfortable dinning areas in and out await here.   The menu has a little of everything and what I've eaten is all very good. Last night the salmon. Was done perfectly and served with a veggie. I also tried the steak and gruyere cheese soup was out of the world.  My man said his burger was fantastic. They grid their meat daily we hear.   Patio is dog friendly btw.   Spoke and wheel is on our list of places for sure. Try it."}
{"text":"Went there tonight to watch NCAA Championship. Ordered a beer and asked about wines for my wife. Waitress was clueless about wines; different types, flavors, everything. If you're going to sell something then know a little about it. Then waited 15 minutes for the drinks before I saw another guy go to the bar and get his own wine order. I then went up and asked the dumb blonde bartender if \"help yourself\" was the way it was done here. She just gave a stupid look and said she could serve me. I told her don't bother and took my warming beer back to our table 10 ft away from the bar! When waitress graced us with her presence she didn't say anything about us having to get our own drinks. Food was very good. Street tacos are the bomb! But wait staff is too young, dumb and full of... They need more and better trained. Place wasn't that busy. Will go back but cutting no slack. Be a decent server or get another job!"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service was horrible!  We recently went to Spoke during trivia night on Saturday, sat outside and ordered food and drink.  1.  30 min wait for initial service  2. Food delivered cold - prob because of the long wait. 3. When we asked for silverware to eat the food that was delivered nothing for ten mins. I see the kid again and his response, \"I'll check on that.\"  Ha!  I just want a fork. Had to forage for two sets from other tables. 4.  Wait between drink orders at least 30 min. 5. They ran out of coors light. What?  I don't blame the waitress - they were understaffed.  No apologies, no manager, nothing. Need to get their act together."}
{"text":"This place is fun because you can ride your bike to it and they will give you happy hour prices. We went about 7pm on a Friday night and there weren't many ppl there. We were able to sit 6 ppl on the patio in comfortable furniture. The service was slow. We actually had to flag down a waiter several times. We ordered, I got the 3 street tacos from the happy hour menu and garlic fries as an appetizer. My water tasted like it came from a sink but was made tolerable by adding lemon. My husband and friends ordered pitchers of beer that were warm and flat. The pitchers were small, about 2 1/2 drinks in each. They were sent back and the waiter suggested another beer that they had on tap that was better.  When my fries came we didn't have any napkins or plates, flagged down waiter again. When the food came it was delicious! Everyone seemed to be happy with their food. The garlic fries were really good as well as the street tacos and the beans that came on the side. When the bill came I was shocked to see that the mixed drink I ordered was normally 9 dollars! I thought that was a lot for a drink served in a mason jar. Luckily we received happy hour prices because we rode our bikes in.  I'm giving 3 stars because of the beer, expensive mixed drinks, having to ask for napkins and the poor tasting water."}
{"text":"Let me start with, we will be back.  Such a cool little spot.  But, we weren't completely wow'd on our first visit.  We stopped in for happy hour on a Saturday night.  It was a bit of an older crowd, but a youthful place, if that makes sense.  The seating area was nice and updated, tv's everywhere with football on, and nice chill music.  The food is what put us off.  I ordered the ribs.  The smoky smell of bbq when you get close to the place put me in the mood.  But, they slathered so much sauce on the ribs, that's all you could taste.  I also liked the sound of their jalapeno coleslaw listed as a side.  I even commented to the server how much it sounded interesting.  Needless to say, just a plan ol Cole slaw showed up.  No jalapeno, no hint of heat.  My wife ordered their southwest salad.  Chipotle Caesar dressing was listed.  But just plain ol Caesar dressing is what came out.  Again, no hint of spicy.  The main reason we will be coming back... everyone else's food looked great!  It made us regret our choices for that night, but interested enough to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Major turnoff was condition of restroom.  A sports bar, lacking any decor, lots of TVs and a huge bar. Food was tasty, nicely presented but slow service. Major turnoff was the filthy restroom which was overdue for a deep cleaning. Will not go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant was ok, we had to wait for a pretty long time even though nobody else appeared to be in line and ended up being seated in a weird back room with two tables. Our waitress was very nice though and our food was good. We had the sausage and pretzel plate for our appetizer which was very good but our fried chicken plate for dinner was just alright."}
{"text":"What a nice little Saturday surprise!  A mix between classy and dive bar with the perfect amount of charm. We decided on the bar and was met with a killer HH bar menu.  The derailer and Paloma were delicious. she ordered the chicken posole and i had the HH burger.  both were cooked to perfection. Ruby the bartender was very attentive and constantly cleaning her bar between serving guest.. I can't wait to come back and try the patio!"}
{"text":"Although our server and the atmosphere were fantastic, the food was just... I'm sorry... eh. The place is bicycle themed, and there are pictures of bicycles everywhere. There is a bicycle that greets you as soon as you walk in. Our server was great, although I cannot remember her name. She was accommodating and sweet. We ordered wings with buffalo sauce. They were good, but they weren't anything special. A few of the wings actually came to us dry; without the buffalo sauce on it. I did like the plate for the wings, though. It had a built-in dipping bowl for ranch. We also ordered a shrimp po' boy and sweet potato fries. The fries were good and were waffle cut. Unfortunately, the shrimp po' boy didn't have enough flavor. It was decent generic bar food, but that wasn't was I was looking for and hoping for at this place."}
{"text":"Lunched at spoke & wheel today. Place was totally empty- what a shame! The food is so good here.  I had the Nacho mama's- LOVE them. Blackened chicken sandwich with pepperjack  and a green chili. Loved the taste. their fries are really good also. My family liked the wings and the bacon truffle burger."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place as it is easy to bike to, but it was not a great experience...unfortunately no restaurant that goes into this location makes it!  --Service: not good. They took forever to bring the food and our drinks took so long to come out that we finally went to the bar and got them ourselves --Food: mediocre and have had much better from the other restaurants in the surrounding area --Patio: no music when we were there on a Friday night, dirty and oddly shaped so weird if you are having a large group  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place has a quiet sports bar type of feel to it. With the open dining room and the menu. We were not sure what to expect with the name \"Spoke and Wheel\". We tried the Mack and cheese with fresh fruit fish and chips three street tacos and the burger with garlic Parmesan fries. The fish and chips was bland fish that was fried with a plain tempura on it, however the regular fries were tasty as if they were cooked in a high-quality oil. The street tacos had excellent presentation and the steak taco was my favorite of them. The burger was outstanding as you could taste the quality of beef. The garlic Parmesan fries were overwhelmingly garlicky and would probably knock Dracula dead! Not sure we would come back because there was nothing to write home about out of the four meals we had."}
{"text":"We love this place, great casual food in a casual environment... Always happy when we come here."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch here today with a friend. Everything was great especially the service. Ruby was our waitress and she was AWSOME. This will be a weekly lunch spot for sure!!!!  Loved it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great - we have been quite a few times and have always looked forward to returning. Good beer selection, priced right. The menu is pub fare that has been fancied up a bit, but it's basically a bar that has good food. I don't know what the negative reviews are about. I get the idea that some of the negative reviewers are expecting a 3 Michelin star experience for $20.00. It doesn't work that way. A reviewer should have appropriate expectations.   This place is a cute neighborhood bar & grill....and we love having them here."}
{"text":"I recently moved into the area in November and have been exploring the neighborhood restaurants.  I had seen the restaurant before but had never stopped in for a bite.  Located right along the canal as well as the Bridle Path along Central Avenue makes it easy to get to on bike or foot.  I don't have a bike, but contemplating getting one to take advantage of their bike-in for all day happy hour.  Too bad there isn't a Lyft/Uber for bikers.  Their french onion soup is delicious and only a small upcharge to replace your side with the soup; I think it was a dollar more.  I've also dabbled in their fries and sweet potato waffle fries, which are delicious; so is their mac n' cheese.  Their burgers are juicy, the buns are beautiful, and the blacked chicken sandwich is awesome.  TBH, we have gone probably 15 times so far and everything we have ordered has been tasty.    Great draught beer selection."}
{"text":"Good location. Spacious with large bar area, comfy booths and cute patio. Had delicious sangria, and mussels. We also enjoyed the sonoran dogs, burgers and calamari. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic hole in the wall. Cozy ambiance and delicious food. Their fish tacos are amazing, burgers juicy, deviled eggs nicely presented, and pretzel bun are soft. Sausages with curry ketchup and cheese dip was tasty too. The waffles fries is also another fave. All in all, great first time experience."}
{"text":"Came in about a month ago for the first time and met Kate. She was working the bar area that day. Great atmosphere and very good food. She makes the best Moscow Mule around! She is very friendly and personable! Came in again in December and she was luckily working again. She remembered me and prepared another fine Moscow Mule with a great smile. This is a great little neighborhood place for friends or family. Priced right on drinks and food items also. Definite place to check out!"}
{"text":"I would give them a 3.5 if I could. The food was pretty good (except the deviled eggs)but the service was below average... I got a regular cheeseburger with sweet potato fries which I think would've been better if it wasn't cold by the time it got to me. Also, the waitress left quickly before I could ask for ketchup and mustard and didn't come back for another 10 minutes... So I had to wait to eat. Who brings a burger without ketchup and mustard? And the deviled eggs were unlike any deviled eggs I'd ever had (not in a good way).... Some kind of weird flavor inside that I didn't like.... And they had capers on them and the oil from the capers made them oily and hard to grip...Maybe it just wasn't my favorite idk what others might think...  And as for the service... I'm hoping that it was just an off day? They did look understaffed and I think my waitress was pregnant so I'll give her a break. Willing to give them another try in the future because the atmosphere is really cool and they seem like they have a pretty good happy hour."}
{"text":"Loved thud place. Super cool sports bar vibe. It's very clean and the staff are great. Brunch had amazing choices but we couldn't resist their burger selection. We noticed a lot of  other people ordering burgers and knew then we had made the right choice. Came out quickly. Bugger was cooked correctly. I got the bacon truffle burger. Nice thick bacon with just the right amount of truffle. Boyfriend got the prime rib bugger and WOW highly recommend. The burger was actually a thick slab of juicy medium prime rib that was so tender. We plan on coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"The Spoke and Wheel has become my new neighborhood hangout. They offer a great happy hour with $5 cocktails, wines and beers and pretty tasty eats. A few of my favorites are the Breakdancer drink and the grilled jalapenos wrapped in bacon (everything is better wrapped in bacon). I brought my grandmother here for lunch and she raved over her chicken sandwich. I had a burger and it well done (as I requested) and the avocado was fresh and creamy.  They have an enormous patio and the service has always been great, they remember my name and drink and are always friendly and fun to chat with .  If you ride your bike (as we often do) they give you happy hour prices all day. Way to support the locals!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch this past Sunday. Got seated and looked at the menus for a few minutes and decided on what we would have. We set the menus on the edge of the table and watched servers walk by us for 20 minutes before we finally walked out to go somewhere where we would be helped."}
{"text":"Hatch Burger on point... Add a fried egg for a little something extra.. Side of Mac&cheese and its all down hill from there..  Great relaxing spot with a dog friendly patio.."}
{"text":"Great burgers great fries the beer was great service . staff is friendly and very helpful Great atmosphere It's a great place to watch a game and drink some beer and burgers The dry rub wings were amazing"}
{"text":"It's a toss up. Most of the time you're waiting a good while for service and your food. Food is usually pretty good though. The wait kills it. That's why only 3 stars. Wait staff is ok. Nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Any place that serves a real vegetable burger deserves a visit.  Don't cha think?  So I tried the meatless magic mushroom burger (10.95).  How do you say \"greasy?\"  Every layer of it was greasy.  From the mayo on the bread that looked like somebody jizzed on my food to the mushrooms, the onions, the tomatoes, the capers, the spinach - all greasy.    The side of yam (sweet potato) waffle fries wasn't greasy, by the way.  They were dry and rather annoying.  How does that work?  The one thing on the plate that I expected to be greasy was totally dry.  Ruby red trout fish and chips (14.95).  Sounds good.  But how does it taste?  Taste?  Ha!  Let me tell you how it looked, because first impressions are very important.  Three small pompously breaded strips of fish sitting on a bed of fried potato cardboard strips.    Need I say more?  Spoke & Wheel goes down in my book as Joke & Steal.  Two stars for the staff who was polite  But my order, naw man, was total shite."}
{"text":"My favorite three burgers in Phoenix and that's saying a lot. Usually a great chill atmosphere. Unlock bonus deals if you bike in.  Their parking lot sucks unless you happen to pull in the only \"correct\" direction and are driving a little short and narrow car."}
{"text":"I only came here because I had a coupon worth $30. The decor and inside vibes were nice however kinda yuppie. We chose to sit on the patio which is comfortable and dog friendly. The service was friendly but the food is where I had some problems. My man and I started of with calamari. It looked and had the rubbery texture of freezer mozzarella sticks. We arrived super stoned and it still didn't taste good. I ordered the Mediterranean pasta. It tasted like a $7 pasta but was priced at almost $13. My man ordered the magic mushroom burger which smelt like dirty boy socks and tasted average. We got Mac n cheese as a side and that was pretty good (velveeta-like taste though), but I could probably make my own version 10x better for the same cost. It had the little crispy topping to it which was a nice touch. Towards the end of our meal we ordered the $7-8 chocolate cake to-go. No one can mess up chocolate cake though... I hope....."}
{"text":"The location has a very relaxed vibe. There was a nice selection of beers and good happy hour options. I have only tried the burger, which was juicy and had a nice amount of smokiness. We will definitely be back! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ok so I think the food is just way better in Arizona haha Another place I used the Yelp app for and was so glad I did! This place was very cool! Loved the atmosphere and the size of the place was really big! The service was great too! Very friendly waitress. Decent prices too.  We happened to have come on a night when they were doing a trivia thing and I really wish I woulda known that because I totally would have come on time so that I could play too! It started at 7pm and I got there at almost 8pm so bummer- was too late in the game to start. The people playing though seemed to be regulars and they were having a lot of fun playing. And btw- did ya know that the first male music artist to be featured on the front cover of \"Rolling Stone\" was John Lennon? And the first female was \"Tina Turner?\" Lol   So I ended up getting their deviled eggs which is one of their specialty items, (there's a little bicycle next to these items) and another specialty item was the chicken pozole soup which I also had, and I had a side order of the Mac and cheese. Everything was amazing! So glad I took the opinions of my fellow yelpers haha great place!   My only regret- not coming by earlier so I could play the trivia and hang out longer. Great place overall! Stop in!"}
{"text":"We used to frequent here weekly and I thought I would give it one more chance after having the worst fried chicken ever.  It was so dry and over cooked not to mention it tasted \"old.\"  We gave it another try the other night and the ribs were horrible.  They were also over cooked and dry.  Not sure what has happened to this place, but the quality of food has good down significantly.  Don't think we were be back again.  Sad to say since we used to enjoy riding our bikes here.  Fries were good so that is why it got 2 stars instead of 1...  Ok, came back again and the service and food were great.   Changed the reviews to four stars.   Fingers crossed for next time"}
{"text":"Such a great location, wonderful ambiance and great idea! The reason for only two stars... Below average  food and cocktails.   I rode my bike here with a friend on a Friday afternoon. The outside patio is wonderful and the inside restaurant is pretty and clean and trendy. The special for bicyclists is all day happy hour. Which is discounts on a couple appetizers and drinks.  We started with two cocktails, queso dip and mussels. The Paloma margarita type cocktail was great, the citrusy cocktail with vodka that I ordered reminded me of college when we attempted to make drinks as sweet and sugary a possible so we couldn't taste the booze. I was told it was supposed to be sweet, but quickly exchanged it for a glass of Chardonnay. The food came out and the chips in my queso dip were stale as for the cheese it was electric orange in color and appeared to be poured from a can. Similar to baseball game nacho cheese. Unimpressive. The mussels were apparently tasty but tough in texture, although I didn't try them.   A couple drinks later with more people joining us we attempted a couple more items. Parmesan fries which were undercooked and mushy, but flavorful. Cauliflower mash which was tasteless. And a salad which was just okay. The winner of the night was the burger which was wonderful.   This restaurant is so close to being good. They have so many great things going for them. Their major hang up is mediocre food. Id be back for more happy hour beer and wine but I would be afraid to eat here again until they got they menu right."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was not.  This is baffling to me as there were only 4 other tables seated in the entire restaurant and 4 dudes walking around in ridiculous plaid shirts but not getting much done."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, though it always seems to take awhile to get our meal. With that said- order the mushroom burger!! Oh my lord it was sooo good! The goat cheese, spinach, bun.. everything just made it incredible.   The outside patio could use some decor, but with their location, not sure how much would remain after a several weeks. Being near a canal does that to you.   Overall, I wouldn't mind coming back again!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and each time it doesn't disappoint. The menu is deep enough that it compels you to return. The last time we went my husband and I split the black truffle burger and it was out of this world. They grind their own sirloin beef. Delicious. I chose the chicken pozole soup to start and it was incredibly delicious. They have an extensive wine list and a full bar with specialty drinks. The staff and service was very good and friendly. They have a kick'in patio and it's a comfortable space. Everyone needs to experience this place and you'll definitely be  repeat customers it's that good. There have been multiple restaurants in this location but none have lasted. We need to help the Spoke and Wheel be the one that lasts. Go tonight you won't regret it!!!!"}
{"text":"WOW!  Order for pick up: Signature Ahi Tuna Burger s/o Sauteed Garlic Kale, Bacon Truffle Burger s/o Mac n Cheese  1st entree: I'm so freaking happy I ordered this. My first thought was tuna atop a beef patty (as it says burger). Though i was first surprised by no beef patty I was blown away again by the taste and texture of this patty! An absolute gem of flavor, hats off to your kitchen staff I will definitely order this again!! However, the kale was a little tough to eat on the basis that it needed to be chopped or sliced thinner. But once again the flavor of this side did not disappoint. Great texture so it was cooked with care. The garlic was clearly visible which for me is a total plus and the use of vinegar on the greens cut through the delicious fattiness of the tuna. Near prefect dish. I drank a coffee porter with this dish and would instead recommend a non-soliciting porter or stout (up to Russian Imperial -- this dish can handle it for sure).   2nd entree: A quintessential comfort combo. The mac n cheese was prefect! We all know the nightmare of mushy Mac n cheese where you can't tell cheese from noodle, well this was none of that. If they make this cheesy yummy sauce in house i would be even happier with this side ( also good choice of noodle ). After devouring that first I wasn't ready for more richness or so i thought! The Bacon Truffle Burger was an unctuous culmination of intense flavors embracing the palate not too intensely, which was very pleasing. Ordered it medium, but it was medium rare (i assume because they expected carry over due to pick up order) but I wasn't upset it was still delicious. I recommend a light/ citrus-y IPA with this meal to break up the richness.  Thank you Spoke & Wheel, i thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food and good selection of beers Love the bike in all day happy hour. The quesadilla is the Bomb! Cheese burger hits the spot.  Sonoran hot dog is also a favorite.  My favorite place in this neighborhood"}
{"text":"We stopped in, and with a Living Social coupon.  My husband ordered a pint, and I ordered a \"flight\" (my first one ever). He had the Spoke and Wheel Burger with garlic fries.  I had the Mediterranean Pasta.  Everything was yummy!"}
{"text":"Perfect! Great outdoor setting and delicious food. Our waiter was also wonderful and did well with 6 kids. Only downside is mixed drink- old fashioned was a bit on the week side."}
{"text":"Awful, food is not cooked all the way, seating is too cramped, place is noisy and people smoke outside, will not go back at all."}
{"text":"I'm not even a cyclist, but the fact that you can ride your bike right into the outside dining area is pretty cool. I went for happy hour and immediately felt at home. The decor was rustic and cycle themed of course. Our server had personality, the drinks had the right amount of alcohol and the HH food tasty. We got there before the Friday dinner rush. But as I looked around, I figured somewhere so off the beaten path, full of people could not be all bad.  It's hard to see right off the road (at least it was for me, I'm blind somwtimes). I've got to come back here and try the rest of the cocktail drinks and some more things on their menu and maybe I'll even get a bike or something."}
{"text":"This is a great place for locals to go for happy hour! Food is great, and you cant beat 5 dollar pitchers on happy hour. Still have figured out the trivia night schedule, but its a nice surprise when I walk in to join the game. Staff is friendly, even with a laid back vibe they still make sure everyone is taken care of. This is my go to place now that I live in the area!"}
{"text":"Had a great time meeting up with friends tonight our server Ryan was amazing and had great recommendations for us we will definitely be back !!! When you go be sure and ask for Ryan!!"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere of this restaurant! It was low-key but was a very fun place to dine. We went at night for later dinner, but I see that they have a good HH and a nice patio. Great service and food. My personal favorite was the banana stuffed churro. To die for!!! This was a great find on Yelp, since I am not from here and not too familiar with the area!"}
{"text":"Love this place and not just because I can walk there. The food is always great although the service isn't as good as Timo's the prices are better. The outside patio is wonderful this time of year but be warned smokers don't always use the smoking side and no one says a word to them which is part of why I can only give 4 stars it's not my job to police and very un-tasteful when trying to enjoy a great meal!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and we liked the decor.  The bike  Theme was a nice touch. We had the dry rub wings and they were great.  The burgers looked very good, but we split the Street Tacos (wished we got the burger). We will be back!"}
{"text":"I frequent Spoke and Wheel as it is close to my house and the food is pretty good.  What kills me is the ambience-the bathroom is dirty, with the faucets not even working properly.  The patio is a disgrace-filthy furniture with dog hair, empty, forlorn planters and a fire pit shoved back in the apex.    The place was several immemorable joints prior to the Spoke-Dillons, Calico Cow, etc.  Heinrich and company slap some paint on the walls and put in a new floor (which is dirty) and call it the Spoke.  Nothing to draw you in...its really just a watering hole for the slopesters.    Lipstick on a pig."}
{"text":"Great place to have few cold ones after long bike ride. The food is awesome and the flavored home made soda things are great too. This is a must try."}
{"text":"A gem of a restaurant!  Beers and specialty drinks are unique and tasty.  Food is simple and packed with a punch of favor.  My favorite is the street taco plate with one of each:  chicken chorizo, carne asada, and swordfish (!).  The guacamole is fresh and zesty, and the accompanying side of beans is a soft and savory addition to the tacos.  Happy Hour here is phenomenal, with the above mentioned dish (along with numerous others) at half price, and $5 beer pitchers and drink specials!"}
{"text":"My friend took me to Spoke &Wheel for an early dinner!  We made it right on time for happy hour !  I don't eat meat or milk products and I really appreciate and like restaurants that honor people choices of lifestyle. This is a regular food restaurant but our waiter and kitchen staff went on and beyond to accommodate my needs. I do have allergies and my food was prepared and served accordingly. Which I m greatly appreciate!  It is a very nice place with lots of room inside and also have outside seating.  I ordered fish and veggie street tacos and our server made sure that any parts of sides or souse was milk free or was substitute for milk free one.  Tacos was very delicious and feeling. White sangria was tasty and booze and as of happy hour was only 5$.  Paid with card and as a surprise got 5% back from Groupon.  Would definitely go back and will recommend."}
{"text":"Me and my roommate were looking for a new local place to eat/grab a drink after a long day. I reviewed Spoke & Wheel quite a bit before suggesting we come here. When we got here i was a little thrown off cause the outside isn't so drawing to the eye. However, upon entering i was very impressed by the atmosphere. We were seated right away and a waitress introduced herself within a minute of us sitting. The atmosphere is relatively dim and intimidate. Full bar with plenty of tvs and room for bigger parties. There's a patio as well that looked pretty large.  The menu was short and simple. Three pages. Drinks, lunch, and dinner. I had the green chili burger with sweet potato fries and it was very very good. Me and my roommate also had a drink. We came during happy hour so i had a pitcher of dales pale ale for $7. The food came out fast and our waitress was attentive but not over bearing. We checked out in a timely manner and also took advantage of the 10% the check promo without hassle.   Overall the place is great and i have already made plans with another friend of mine to come with. The one critique i have maybe is the pricing on the burgers. They were delicious, but close to $15 for a burger and fries threw me a bit. Nevertheless, I'm still coming back. Great job Spoke & Wheel!"}
{"text":"Our server Jay was my personal highlight, if for no other reason than getting to hear him try and pronounce Kazivah's super cool name.  He was pretty attentive, and single-handedly cleared our table for a group photo, which he took.  This guy was a one man show.  The guac and chips was a-ok standard fare.  The mac-n-cheese was sub-par, but the green chile burger was pretty good.  Even though the bloody mary was way spicy, J said it could be one of her favorites.  Not really much more to say than that.  The booth was comfortable.  Scooch over yous!  ;)"}
{"text":"Our review is based on service. We arrived at 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon and decided to sit out on the patio. They did appear to be overly busy as we walked through the bar to sit outside. It's not that our food took a crazy amount of time to come out it's that our waitress rarely checked on us. We ordered chips and queso with our drinks before ordering our meals. We were served our drinks but never received our chips and queso. Our meal came out as we ordered it. Yet again we were not checked on by our waitress until I was ready for the check. I'm all about service and unfortunately we just didn't get that here today."}
{"text":"Cool environment. Mac and cheese was good. Beer was cold"}
{"text":"Amazing soup, ribs and the Hatch Chili Burger is awesome. Get the steak and onion soup. I travel from the east valley to get this soup."}
{"text":"Spoke and Wheel is located just south of Dunlap and Central Ave - This place has been several different restaurants but with the updated place the decor is super cute and trendy.  Bar; We came on Easter and you could tell it may have been busier than expected - so we all had the Bloody Mary bar that was Amazing.  The bartender did tell us please let her know if anything was not avail and she was replace immediatly.   Food; I tried to Easter Brunch menu and this dish was Avacado on a Toast dish, while it doesnt sound delicious it was Amazing and the hash browns if that what you want to call them are amazing.  Its hard to decribe these hash browns - they are whole potatoes in diced into large piece than maybe fried and/or baked but delicious.  Service; Oh boy - like mentioned above not sure they were expecting to be as busy as they were and service was a bit slow. But our server was definietly working his butt off - and you could tell her was super busy, we didnt mind helping him out.     Will def go back again and again."}
{"text":"We visited Spoke and Wheel today.  We have been coming here for several years.  The food is always excellent and the servers go out of their way to keep you happy.  It is on the bike path so even more fun when the weather is nice"}
{"text":"Food: 5 stars (wings burgers pretzel/sausage plate, Mac and cheese, waffle sweet potato fries, shoestring fries ) Happy hour specials(all day when you ride your bike): 5 stars Ambiance is what is lacking here. Maybe it's my fault for wanting this place to be more of a sports bar like Zipps. It's more of a family restaurant with great pub food.   Every time I'm here it's never too busy but the staff claims they are busy most other nights. Trivia night I hear is a packed house.   Ultimately-i would put the food up against anyone in town but if you are looking to watch a game this may not be the most exciting place to do it.   Service has been great but I sit at the bar so I'm not sure how table service is usually."}
{"text":"The husband and I went to Spoke and Wheel last weekend to check out their awesome happy hour! I have been to Timo a few times and liked it very much, so was excited for S & W. We sat at the bar so we had access to their 'bar only' menu of specials. This was cool because they had food specials at the bar prior to having the specials for happy hour in the rest of the restaurant and the specials were slightly different. We got a cheeseburger with fries (7$), guac and house made chips (4$), and wings (7$ I think...). We also had the sangria and beer, which were good and affordable at 5$. The food all sounded good, but none of it was anything terribly spectacular. The burger has house ground meat and house made buns.... sounds great, right? Well, it was good, but it lacked some flavor. I know it was a very simple burger, and their menu has several other burgers on it that look more delicious, but I was a little disappointed with this one (would definitely go back to try one of their 'fancy' burgers though). The garlic fries were delish. The wings were standard wings, good, but just typical. The guac was good, but I wish it was spicy.... the house made chips were nicely done, though, they were thin and crispy. I would definitely give this place another chance, but it just isn't at the top of my list at this moment since nothing really stood out (prices were good though!)."}
{"text":"I guess I would say 3-stars - though the Yelp-explanation of 2 stars is more what I was thinking: \"Meh, I've experienced better.\"  I have driven by here a number of times and wanted to check it out. I see people biking and going in, which seemed fun, like a great neighborhood spot. We are a little bit far to bike, and seeing that it was a Friday night that we decided to go, we drove.  We waited a bit to be seated, as we walked in at the same time as another couple and we all kind of stood there unsure of what to do since there was nobody at the host stand for some time. Finally a young man came up, sat the other couple and then us. The dining room wasn't too full, and they seemed to seat people in the surrounding booths first which was all good for us - until we saw the booth we got. It didn't seem that it was a big deal to sit right next to the bar, until after awhile we learned there was a server's station right behind it in a little spot between the edge of the booth and the bar. Constantly, server's were squeezing in and out of the spot and talking there and it got to be a bit much.   Our server was polite, but not all that friendly. I would say service was just average, no connection there. Maybe she didn't want to be there, maybe she was working a double, maybe her knickers were literally in a twist - who knows?  We ordered a round of their signature cocktails - see photos uploaded. Nothing special, a little overly sweet. I switched to beer.   We both ordered burgers, medium. They came to us medium rare but by this point we were over it and just ate them. I had the Spoke and Wheel burger, good flavor and combination of ingredients, I wouldn't not-ever eat it again. He got the Bacon Truffle Burger and thought it was okay, nothing to write home about.   I don't know what it was with our experience that just nothing really stood out. I mean, the place looks cool, we liked the decor and lay out. We were more impressed by their cool light fixtures than all of the TVs. It wasn't really busy for a Friday night, so the energy level was 'meh'. The service wasn't great, I mean, the host who couldn't have been over 20, seemed to be the most chipper person in the place. The food tasted good but wasn't cooked to order. The drinks, well...  I guess that's why we agreed it was just a \"Meh, I've experienced better.\" But on my scale, I would still say it's a 3-star, good not great. But to each their own! I am sure this is some people's favorite place in the city."}
{"text":"After Strong Beer Festival on Saturday, we were in desperate need of a cool place to chill, hydrate, and eat up and this was the chosen spot. We got a nice spot on a patio and really enjoyed it out there, it was a perfect evening for it. We shared some nachos, chips and queso, and my friend had a burger and mac and cheese. Food came out quickly, drinks weren't as fast but we did get an update from our waitress on those so that was just fine by us. I thought the food was pretty bland and unremarkable, the chicken \"chorrizo\" on the nachos was nothign more than ground chicken with some onions and spice which left me wanting more.   Downside is probably the lack of attentiveness after the food was dropped off. I would see our waitress go by and look at the table, but because we had drinks on the table, she assumed we weren't ready to go. After about 30 minutes of being done and ready to pay we finally waved her over, while I understand that a half-full beer might mean to you that we're just taking our time and you shouldn't bother us, it could also mean it just wasn't good and we're ready to head out.   That being said, not a dealbreaker or really a reason to not to come back. After all.the entire menu looked great, the setup was nice and the decor was very inviting. I'd like to come back during the day and enjoy the patio along the canal, get a full meal and the full experience but for now was just kinda meh."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere in the service at spoke and wheel in my boyfriend and I went and visited. They have lots of great beers on tap and delicious food. I had the torta and it was simply marvelous! Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"A friend told me about The Spoke and Wheel. She said it was a bar that catered to cyclists. Her description fell short. I rode my bicycle there because they advertise \"Bicycle in for All Day Happy Hour\".  From the moment I arrived I was impressed. They have an enclosed patio (with a misting system) and that's where they provide their guests with parking for their bikes. I quickly realized that this is *not* a bar, but a family friendly restaurant that encourages folks to get out, be active, and have fun.  I had the Fish Street Tacos, and the fish was grilled - not fried. It smelled wonderful and tasted even better. The staff was very accommodating, friendly, and attentive to their guests.  I saw a review where someone regretted not living close enough to ride in. So I have to suggest... If you live too far away? Drive to one of the parks along the canal, and ride in from there. The paths along the Arizona Canal are wonderful to ride, or run, on. You'll have a beautiful ride and an excellent atmosphere to relax in, cool off, and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"This was a nice restaurant for happy hour. They have amazing calamari and fish tacos."}
{"text":"This place was a great find! Our friends took us here on Saturday and we enjoyed some AMAZING food and drinks for under $30. I highly recommend the deviled eggs for a starter-- YUMM! The bartender was totally service-driven and was pleasant to chat with. He did a great job and we all tipped him very well. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A very comfortable, amazing place.  Just happened by one evening and I am so glad I did. The atmosphere is very comfortable, with booths along the tables, a nice bar with comfy stools/ chairs and an eclectic mix of music that is not so loud that you can't talk.  The bartenders have all been very friendly and helpful. Brian stands out as a great guy and bartender. The entire staff has always been very accommodating and friendly.  The food......  The food.....    So good!  The burgers are delicious and cooked the way you ask. Lots of diff styles of burgers. My fav is the green chile burger. Garlic/ parm cheese fries to die for. They also do mussels in a white wine, tomato  and herbs broth that is incredible!!  My partner in crime has had a few of the salads and raves about the Apple, Gorgonzola salad.   I hope business picks up for them. I would hate to see them disappear. It would be a big loss for the area. And me!!!"}
{"text":"After a day of pedicures, we wanted some grub.  Kazi H. said this place was more of her style so voila~  Four famished individuals stumbled into this cute little place.  The food was decent, the staff was friendly, and I had a lovely time!  Let me first say that their Bloody Mary is amazing.  Good flavor, nice heat [although a bit too spicy for me but that's because I'm weaksauce], and what a generous serving.  No skinny collins glasses here!  Anywho, I got the Sonoran dog with the mac and cheese.  What can be said about a deliciously grilled hot dog with bacon, tomatoes, beans, mustard, mayo, and grilled onions?  It hit the spot although my bun completely fell apart about halfway through.  I'm a slow eater and I had great company that kept me distracted and laughing!  The mac and cheese was alright, nothing spectacular to write home about.  I also got to try the chips and guacamole which I apparently forgot to take a picture of.  Oh well!  It's just regular guacamole and chips, y'all.  Nothing fancy.  Would I be back?  I probably would stop by if I were in the area for that Bloody Mary.  Jayzus!"}
{"text":"Stop by and try their take on a Cubano, called a Cuban Torta. It's delish!  The ham and pork are great but it's the thin slice of pineapple included that I love!  The house white wine, Provisioner white blend, on tap, is great for the summer!"}
{"text":"This is a spot I love to go on the weekends to grab a beer something about this bar is if you ride your bike there happy hours all day and all night whenever you come in also the food is very good and they are quick and serving the selection of beers is great in the bar area is full of TVs which is also very nice"}
{"text":"Best lunch special in town. Pitchers of beer great deal also. Soup salad sandwich 10 dollars.awesome"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers!!! I'd come back for sure!  They helped with a AZK9 fundraiser (non profit to help people keep their pets) and that made me come here.  They had a nice deal with burger, fries, and drink.   The burger was the best burger I've ever had anywhere.  It was fresh, large, and cooked to perfection. I order medium well and it came just right. And no burn marks or charring on the outside like most places end up doing.  It was so delicious."}
{"text":"How does this place not have 6 stars!    My wife and I came skidding into this place after doing some rad jumps and tricks along the canal on our bmx bikes. Perfect setting for brunches and dinners -- whether it's with a date or a group. Caitlyn was my server and all I can say is she really knew her stuff! She greeted me right away with a smile, knew the menu and suggested some cold beers off the tap and mentioned the canned beer of the month and some great starter foods off the menu. The carnitas tacos are banging and you should seriously try the nachos, you wont be disappointed! The atmosphere is really chill and laid back with a dog friendly patio. Thats definitely a plus for me and my three dogs, Wes, Molly and Chata!  The restaurant is located right off of Central, great location for a pre or post meal walk especially since the canal is right there! And Happy Hour all day if you ride your bike in!!!  Spoke N Wheel is an awesome tavern and I can't wait to come back again with my wife and bring our newborn baby, Brody and three pups!  Thanks for being my new favorite neighborhood bar!!"}
{"text":"I love a restaurant that is has a dog-friendly patio, that will always get my business at least once.  We've eaten here twice this week, and I found it to be a mixed lot.  On both occasions the service was not as good as I'd expected: I don't want staff at my arm every five minutes, but letting my tea go empty for 15+ minutes is excessive.  Sunday visit: had the bacon burger with the truffle oil, ordered medium well.  Medium well means between medium and well-done.  It was decidedly more on the medium side of that scale, which made for a sad burger.  Having said that, the parm/garlic fries were quite good, though I thought they were also a little under-done.  We also had an appetizer basket of fried calamari, sadly it was very chewy.  The breading flavor and dipping sauces were good, but it took a lot of jaw action to get them down.  It also seemed like the wait staff was busy bustling about and not getting a lot done, full of sound and thunder but signifying nothing.  It's possible they were under-staffed for a Sunday afternoon, I don't know.  Wednesday we met friends there, some of whom frequent the place, we walked and brought our dog.  The patio seating was nice, but again, the service was not up to what I think are decent standards.  I think they should have one person on the patio with a ticket station out there, instead there were long periods of time that no staff were out there.  The food was a much better experience, I had the Sonoran Hot Dog and it was excellent, I'd definitely return for it.  That being said, everyone else liked their food, so overall, I'd say good food but don't expect top-notch service."}
{"text":"What a great evening!  We stopped in for a quick bite, not knowing what to expect, and ended up missing our theater performance because we were having such a great time.  The food was wonderful and very affordable for a family of 4.  We loved Trivia night!  We are looking forward to going back again this weekend.  It is really hard to tell from the outside what it will be like but give it a try.  I think you will like it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and very friendly staff! The drinks on the drink menu and delicious and they use freshly squeezed juices and make their own syrup. The food was also very good. The prices and very reasonable and you cannot beat the 5 dollar specials all day for riding your bike! I would recommend this to anyone. Definitely a new hang out spot!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Drink prices are great. Good selection of food on happy hour. The peel and eat shrimp was delicious. Also had the wedge salad which was really good. I will definitely be back."}
