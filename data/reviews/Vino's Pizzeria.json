{"text":"They shouldn't call themselves a pizzeria. Don't eat here, food is horrible. They served us old burnt pizza slices. The server was okay but the fact that he thought it was okay to serve that pizza was insulting. 

WONT recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"After a movie I was passing by this place and decided to check out the menu. Slices were just a couple bucks so I picked out a slice as did my wife. Bad news was they only even had 2 slices left. The pizza was so disgusting. I took one bite and then made the terrible mistake of taking a second bite. I went quickly to a trash can and threw it out. The pizza slice was like cardboard and what the heck that cheese really was is beyond me. I have had frozen frozen pizzas that were way better. They had not much out to chose from even thought they had a menu with several specials. The customer ahead of me tried to order a sandwich and they said they were out of something needed to make it and then I'm stuck choosing a slice of sausage that looks petrified because all the other trays were empty. I asked the dude working if they had any pizzas coming out of the oven and he said they didn't. Why are you open if you have no food? I'll pass in the future."}
{"text":"Place is always empty and perfect for after a movie! The pizza is really good, and its a pretty big pie for what you're paying! The pizza is always warm and they'll make it to order which is great!"}
{"text":"I have had some pretty tasty pizza from casinos, so I was all for trying this place. They have different menu options, but are known for the pizza by the slice they sell. The cheese slices were $1.99 each and that's fair. What's not fair is how the pizza looks and tastes. They had several pizza trays out yet hardly any pizza to choose from. I am a cheese pizza kind of girl, so I asked for the last slice of cheese they had out. The guy working seemed bothered that a customer would dare come in and order anything and upset that he had to be at work. I just didn't care for the whole experience at all. I was going to eat inside, but after the way the guy working made me feel, I asked for it to-go. The pizza didn't look any better after being reheated. I ate maybe half of it and then just couldn't take the nasty taste anymore. The pizza slice here reminded me of the type I had from the snack bar at the roller skating rink I went to when I was younger and I didn't like it then either. This place just didn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"Salad was fine. The crust was cardboard like and must be from an inexpensive dough. This wasn't even as good as mall chain pizzas."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this establishment has gone from mediocre to why bother. As popular as the Cannery is, they need to step up their game and spend the money to improve their quality. In my example, I'm a wing girl who likes to get them to go.  I like how they fry their wings but they don't even coat them in sauce, they serve it on the side. Really? Don't live close anymore so why bother."}
{"text":"SUCKS ! Pizza tasted like factory frozen mass produced cardboard . Pizza was sitting under warming lights for who how long , just really not pizza unless you have no taste ."}
{"text":"This place makes Sbarro look gourmet.

The big up is that the place is clean and attractive enough and the service was polite. But the pizza (we got 2 cheese slices and a medium drink) was lackluster. The crust was a little thick and flavorless and the sauce was a bit on the sweet side and lacked depth. 

Usually \"by the slice\" places will heat your slice in the oven before presenting it, but we were given two congealed slices right from under the heat lamp.

It was under $7, so for the price, if you're drunk, this gets the job done.  But, if you're looking to actually enjoy a slice of pizza, I'd go elsewhere.

(This review is specifically for the Pizzeria and not the Ristorante, as I've never eaten there and haven't tried anything other than their pizza by the slice.)"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat here after seeing a movie at the Galaxy theater next door. We were starved and Vino's  Pizzeria presented itself as a cheap and easy option for fast food.  Upon inspection,  the place looked quiet and clean.  Since we were virtually the only customers,  we were helped immediately. I ordered a slice of cheese pizza, $1.99, and my husband got a pepperoni pizza slice combo for $4.50. Lunch for under $8? I'm not complaining.  

The counter attendant was polite and reheated both of our slices in the oven. My cheese pizza looked and tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. It was just a standard slice pizza,  nothing special.  My husband lucked out- his slice was fresh and super cheesy.

What I liked about the pizzeria was that it was quiet and more importantly, cheap! I'll be back if I'm ever in the casino and need a quickie meal."}
{"text":"This was me and boyfriends first time eating from Vinos and it was a bad experience. I ordered a Gyro with extra meat, grilled onions, no tomatoes, with extra cucumber sauce and a side of feta cheese and fries. I asked if they could also put ketchup in the bag. My boyfriend order a steak and cheese with green peppers, onions, mushrooms and everything else that came on it with a side of fries. We received our food 30mins later, it was cold they didnt give us any fries instead we got chips, my gyro had tomatoes on it, it barely had cucumber sauce, my onions were barely grilled. my boyfriend said his sub was cold and nasty and he only had 2 small pieces of tomatoes on his sub so i picked mine off and gave them to him. They did give me my feta cheese and ketchup though. So i call back and tell them i didnt get my fries and cucumber sauce i didnt tell them the food was cold and they put tomatoes on my gyro because i didnt want to make a big deal about something i can fix, but the lady tells the manager about the fries and cucumber sauce and she tells me they will send the fries. I ask were they also going to send the cucumber sauce and she tells me \"we are all out of cucumber sauce\" so that made me feel like im just shit out of luck, why couldnt they have told me they were out when i ordered it, instead they charged me for an item i never got. After receiving the fries my boyfriend didnt even want them because he was so dissatisfied with the quality of the service. First impressions are important if you make a bad first impression that sticks with you, unless you do something to make up for it. Ill probably never eat here again. Yall need better employees or a new manager because whoever made my order didnt care enough to double check to make sure the order was right."}
{"text":"My Ex Chris decided to take me out on a last minute date night for the hell of it and we were hungry. We decided to stop here and eat as it was right next to the Galaxy Theater where we went to see Xmen! We looked at the options and decided to just order a whole pizza rather than order a few slices which would have cost the same. Two drinks and a whole large pizza $14 bucks can't beat that for a tasty and filling dinner!

The pepperoni pizza was very good. I love that they are generous with the cheese and toppings. That is one thing I dislike is when a place is stingy with the cheese, well not here!

I think this could become a regular spot for the spontaneous dinner and a movie night!

They have a lot of Italian style options available and you can order pizza by the slice.

I am a Fan :)"}
