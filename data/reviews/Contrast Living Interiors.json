{"text":"I had actually put off getting my mom a birthday present until the day of, and I had to do some very quick thinking in order to scrounge up a gift for her. As I'm frantically trotting up and down Queen St, looking for an engravables(my usual go-to for last minute gifts)I see this unassuming black store.

At first glance I thought this store looked gothy as hell and there's no way my mom would have anything of interest there. After looking at the furniture store a bit further down, I relented and thought that I would take anything I didn't have to call an U-haul for and went back to Contrast Living.

If Greenpeace finally succumbed to the money in the whale trade, and then used their whale-hunting profits to open up a store with Urban Outfitters, this would be their flagship store. The whole store has this campy, eco-friendly, vintage vibe. 

First thing I noticed about this store is the smell. It smells kind of like Green Grotto, pleasant yet heavy on the spices. Not unlike a stick of Oldspice. Second thing I notice is the storeowner's beaming smile as he welcomes me to the store. My first thought was \"Ah crap, here comes the sales pressure\" but the guy was actually very laid back. In fact he kinda gave me a guided tour of everything they had that might be good for a mom-gift.

First part of the journey was to a card-stand on the right which had these pop-up cards made of solid wood, which were pretty kewl. He also brought me over to a display of airplants which are plants which can sustain themselves without water or soil.

The airplant really solved all my problems. It was a low-maintenance plant which requires little to no effort on my part to upkeep, also my mom agreed to pay my tuition for another year. Two birds with one glass encased plant.

All in all, a pretty good place to shop."}
{"text":"Queen west has a new arrival and it's pretty darn cute! 

Located a few blocks east of Roncy on Queen and surrounded by antique stores, cute restaurants, this place is where it's at. The store is full of anthropology like stuff from wall decor to hand creams to jewellery and everything else in between.

The store's grand opening was this weekend and was just full of people coming to check it out. The store owner is sweet and eager and I think will do really well.

We walked out with a pretty necklace and stellar little mail holder thing. The prices were very reasonable too."}
