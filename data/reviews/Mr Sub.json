{"text":"I have visited this location once a week for the last 7 years of my life. 
Always consistent with toppings (they do not cheap out), great friendly service, and better than subway any day of the week. 

if you need a quick lunch for not too much $ then this is the spot"}
{"text":"Coworkers and I go here regularly.
Bunch of older gents working here.
Brisk and efficient.
The best and most consistent subs in the area.
Please keep it up."}
{"text":"Generally a competently run restaurant. Two main employees; the male is very friendly despite English being a second language. The female is competent, but not friendly, perhaps there is a language barrier. The restaurant is clean, and the layout is open, a little more spacious perhaps than some other locations in town. Parking is good, being in a mini-mall parking lot. 

One very strange quirk is that if you dine in, they won't give you a tray to carry your food on. They just pile your order on the counter. They keep the trays underneath the counter, on their side of the register. If you specifically ask for one, they will give you one, but it is a special request. I've never seen that at any other location. They usually stack them up right by the till and just put the items on them automatically. 

No real complaints; menu items are standard for Mr. Sub. Compare and contrast to Subway and Quiznos and see what you like. The one feature I wish they had that Extreme Pita does have, is a calorie count right on the menu boards."}
{"text":"Hello,

Today November 29th 2016 at 2:15pm I entered this location inquiring for a tasty late lunch.  In return I was welcomed with disrespect and a total lack of professionalism.  The location was empty excluding myself and the 1 employee assisting (using the word \"assisting lightly here).  She was rude,  rolling her eyes at me on more than 1 occasion in this visit to your store, she barely included any toppings on my sandwhich (5 small peices of cucumber for a footlong sandwhich, and the same for pickles and banana peppers).  All poorly organized I might add...  However the fact that I was perfectly pleasant and friendly, and got a terrible attitude from her and a total lack of customer service has left me annoyed and disappointed in this location.  

My company has frequented this location many times which brought me to it.  I will be sure to inform my colleagues that this location should be the last location in foothills industrial to get any of our business.

Thank you-"}
{"text":"The best Mr. Sub in town! They do not cheap out on the toppings! Bread is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Horrible service for a Mr. Sub franchise.  Staff was rude, service was slow.  The server was in the middle of making my sandwich and stopped to answer his cell phone.  Then was on the phone for 5 minutes.  What kind of service is that?"}
{"text":"Chilli taken out of a plastic bag, then not heated enough (microwaved), bad taste, owner irritated"}
{"text":"One good thing is generally they have fresh buns. Having said that I've had numerous negative experiences here. I only go here because it's the closest Mr. Sub. 
Stingy on their veggies and poor customer service. Allows people to cut line, had hair in my sub and won't even open up more veggies with an hour left until close. Avoid."}
{"text":"The place is clean, and the staff are generally nice. However, they're really stingy with the toppings, and will even refuse to add more if you ask for a reasonable amount (I'm not talking about crazy extras, just a normal amount of toppings). They pile on the iceberg lettuce, but you're out of luck if you ask for more than four pickle slices on a foot long sub."}
{"text":"Great place, strange thing is that it's located right in 16th a main drag here in Calgary and everytime i go here it is dead as a doornail.

Friendly people, good selection and yes it's a franchise but i have seen many and experienced many franchised places that once the person buys it turns it into a dive. 

This is a great place to stop grab a bite and carry on with ya day!

Cheers

GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Mr Sub is always one of my favourites as compared to Subway! This location is pretty nice n organized well ... Will go again for sure"}
{"text":"This Mr. Sub is super garbage. I ordered the rib sub which is being advertised a lot right now. And I actually remember a rib sub i used to get there when I was a kid, and loved it. But this was no trip down memory lane. They basically didn't know what went on the sandwich. They asked me what I wanted, and i actually pointed to the poster for reference. They then told me they didn't have half those things and cheese was an extra $1 (wtf?!). The sandwich was surprisingly gross."}
{"text":"Got a 12\" turkey on white..the worst sub ever!!!! dry, lack of sauce, extremely salty, very cheap on the ingredients, lettuce is heavy but this is the worst tasting sub and the owner is the same as before.  He is cheap as can be and least generous with the assembly of ingredients.  Furthermore, the ingredients are far from fresh.  The bread tastes stale too. Some things never change even though the renovation took place.  You'd think things would improve.  Far from!! Do not go here unless you want to get ripped off."}
{"text":"Super clean and food was fresh.  Ordered canadian club and meatball and had them grilled. Tasted amazing.  Highly recommended this location. I don't go to the Y but people who do get 10% off."}
{"text":"I've always thought that Mr. Sub is much better than subway; everything is much more fresh, clean and generally tastes like what it claims to be. I'm sad to say, however, that the Mr. Subs on Yonge Street (both, between Yonge and Carlton) are a big disappointment, especially if you're expecting good service. I get the \"cheese and veggie\" sub, every time and in many cities and it's always the same and delicious but not on Yonge Street! Having worked in the food and beverage industry for over a decade I can say, with a lot of confidence, that these two locations are practically stealing money from their wonderful and Canadian franchise. I get less than half the vegetables (lettuce, tomato, cucumbers and mushroom) and practically no cheese when I go to these locations instead of ANY other Mr. Sub. I tried to point out the discrepancy once and was told I'd have to pay more for an extra slice of cucumber. I said I'd leave and go to another sandwich shop across the street and even though there was no one else in the store, as usual, the owner, who was working at the time, told me I could not leave and had to pay for the unfinished sub that I would never had asked for if I'd known they followed their one set of rules, independent of the rest of the franchises!  Obviously I left and I'll never go to another Mr. Sub anywhere. It's easy to make my own sandwich, costs practically nothing and I don't have to deal with pretentious, ego driven staff and owners!   Try to Loblaws at yonge and carlton; great selection of fresh vegetable and bread."}
{"text":"When I want a sub I usually come here.  These guys really know how to put a sandwich together.  Nothing but a quality sub here!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for years. Staff is very friendly and quick. The restaurant is always clean and the food is delicious.  

I usually get the assorted sub or spicy breaded chicken. I get the cheese bread or Mediterranean bread and the Chipotle sauce. 

I would recommend this Mr Sub to anyone who likes a great tasting sub and a nice clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Worst tuna salad and seafood salad of any Mr. Sub I've ever been to in my entire life.  They use so much mayo it is SLOP, not salad.  I feel sorry for anyone who is forced to rely on the food at this location.  Either they don't have a clue how to make tuna/seafood salad properly, or they're cheap and trying to use 10% tuna/seafood and 90% mayo.

Head office should investigate this ASAP, it is beyond unacceptable.  No food business owner with respect for their customers would ever do this.  Don't take my word for it, go and check it out for yourself, then report the location to head office!"}
{"text":"Visited this Mr.Sub last night with my boyfriend and we both had the best customer service experience we've had in a very long time with a fast food chain such as this. Especially when the worst experience of my life is at the Burger King across on the very same intersection (Dundas/Winston Churchill). I did not get the gentleman's name who was working last night at about 7:00pm but he was truly pleasant and wonderful. Keep him happy."}
{"text":"I go to this location often. Today was my last visit.

I ordered pepper chicken flatbread.  Simple. Lettuce cucumber cheese bacon and some dressing.
The owner placed 3 cucumber slices. I asked for a few more and was told I would be charged extra.
And then got a lecture on how a cucumber cost 1$ for all those slices as he pointed at the over flowing tub of sliced cucumber

I asked how much for the cucumber and got a very cold stare down.  
He then rudely placed just one more slice of cucumber on my order.  

This location is going down hill fast. Last few visits were not positive.."}
{"text":"Best Mr Sub in Toronto. Always fresh ingredients and fresh bread. Most of the other Mr Subs can learn from this location."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location on numerous occasions .  It is close to my chiropractor so I stop in for a late lunch.  I have been there once every two weeks since January, and not once have they had multigrain bread.  They always say that they have run out.  It's 2pm and again no multigrain.  Well that's it no late lunch for me at this location any more."}
{"text":"I'm not usually one to review restaurant chains, but in this case, I thought it was warranted - the last review of this location is from 1.5 years ago, and I had a better experience compared to that 1-star review during my visit yesterday. 

THE GOOD: 
- I went for a 12\" roast beef and cheddar sub on cheddar bread. I like to keep it simple: my toppings were red onion, honey mustard and light mayo. The bread was extraordinarily soft and fresh, and the sub as a whole hit the spot. 
- With a can of Pepsi, my sub came to just over $10 with tax. 12\" is definitely the best value when you're hungry - eat it all on the spot like me, or save half in the fridge for your next meal. 
- This location has a liquor license! I don't think is commonplace for Mr. Sub, but why not? (It's 5:00 somewhere!) Domestic beers are $4 and imported beers are $5. 

THE BAD:
- The interior isn't anything to get excited about - a little dingy and rough around the edges. The leather seats in some of the booths are ripped. With that said, I didn't have high expectations and it was still clean enough to sit down and eat. 
- At 3pm on a Monday, only one lady was working the counter. A family in front of me ordered 3 subs as I walked in, so there was a short wait (5-10 minutes). I would hope that they have more staff during busier periods. 

Subway is across the street from this location, and if I had to choose between the two, I would definitely vote for Mr. Sub. To me, the ingredients at Subway taste old and processed, and all of their subs start to taste the same. Mr. Sub, on the other hand, has the freshest bread and superior ingredients. That's just my $0.02 - take it or leave it."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Their big promo was for the new Brisket au Jus subs. The beef one looked delish. 
But when I asked for it, they informed me \"we don't have au jus\" . Wtf? If this is the franchise's current big new sandwich, you should carry the critical components. 
I got the meatball sub instead. You would think a meatball sub would have marinara or pasta sauce, at the very least. But no, these cheapos put BBQ sauce on it. Gross
Not to mention that the whole time my friend & I were ordering, the 3 men behind the counter spoke loudly in a foreign language to each other"}
{"text":"Just make sure you speak loud to bald guy. He's clueless"}
{"text":"Definitely a disappointing place to go. The subs were mediocrely made and the customer service was absolutely horrible. It's really hard to order food when and the person behind the counter does not know how to speak English. Usually that's not an issue as I can communicate fairly well but she was extremely rude about it. In conclusion never again."}
{"text":"I am a regular here late at night; the server is a very nice guy and makes the subs perfectly; is always get a super assorted on white and he makes it well; 

Food is good, service good; friendly place"}
{"text":"I really don't know what's going on at this location because about 3 months ago it was great. Great friendly customer service, great quailty subs, fast service no complaints but within the last 2 times I've been there it's been nothing but HORRIBLE! It seems like they have new ownership and these people are nothing compared to the last. There is always only 1 man making the subs and 2 ladies in the back doing I don't know what and 1 lady at the cash. The line ups are always soooo long around the lunch hour and only the 1 man is making subs. It doesn't make any sense to me. He is always very stingy with the toppings. You have to keep asking for more and even then it's still not up to par with what a normal sub usually looks like. I left both times with a flat sub. I thought maybe the first time this happened it was a one off but nope, it happened again even worse then the first time. I most definitely will not be coming back to this location. One customer lost and I'm sure many more to go based on customer conversation in the line up."}
{"text":"Agree with what's been said already. Just like to point out that for me, the \"bread\" can make or break a sub. On my visit here, this location had the freshest white bread that I've had for a sub in years. The place is spacious with lots of seating without the feeling of being \"cramped\". Very nice. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Don't go here, go to Subway across the street. The owner is ridiculous. I would give this place zero stars if it were possible. Very cheap with the toppings, and made me feel guilty for asking for an adequate amount after only putting on 4 slivers of mushrooms. Then sarcastically said \"since you picked so many toppings, why stop there?\". I'm there for a sub, not to be guilt tripped about wanting toppings on it. Definitely not returning."}
{"text":"I come here ever so often, most of the time at night and usually i'm one of the only customers that show up lol. The staff always make a mean sub here too."}
{"text":"Great service, clean, clean washrooms, fresh quality food.
My sub was loaded with fresh toppings and the bread was like it was just baked! Will be going back to this spot."}
{"text":"This is a great option if you are looking for something different and quick in a fast food plaza.

Mr. Sub hasn't really made the inroads into the consumer mindset like a subway or quiznos has.  It's got some staples but really doesn't offer much to differentiate it...in fact many people in the area drive a few minutes north to where a subway is located.

Subs tend to be on the small size especially in comparison to their bigger Subway cousins.

The seating space is small, which makes sense as most of the clientele in the area is coming to grab something for the desk.  

For me, it's been a place to grab something when I want variety from tim's or wendy's."}
{"text":"A good quick meal in between work! Kinda stumbled into this store as I needed a quick lunch, but didn't actually know what was here. 

A relatively large location, but went in on a Saturday afternoon, and there was only one staff working in the whole store... He was making sandwiches for customers, making new bread, and covering cash. A bit much for one person in my opinion, which also delayed my wait time. Not his fault at all, but definitely could have been avoided with just one more person working!

The service was quick and efficient, and was able to get my sandwich and go within 5 minutes (after the initial wait). A good location for lunch if I'm ever in the area again, but probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here at all!"}
{"text":"So I tried Mr. Sub yesterday. Canadian and all, I thought, why not switch a love brand (@Subway) and give the local guy a chance. I visited (3040 Danforth Ave, East York, ON M4C 1N2) and let's say I will never try Mr. Sub again. Not only that, I frown upon those who do because of my experience at this particular location (parts makes the whole). The owner/server was rude and unfriendly - not once did he smiled at the guest ordering from him. When it came my turn, he rushed the order and the worst parts has to be: 1. I ordered a 12 inch Tuna and 12 inch meatball, wanting 5 vegetables on it, and he said, \"Only 3 - this is a sandwich I'm making, not a salad!\". Add to this, 2. when I asked if I can have 2 particular sauces, he said, \"Meatballs already have its sauces - why do you want more?\" I still ordered because I believe the service might be one part, and the food, another. It ain't so. The breads are stale, the vegetables are older and limited, and above all, no free napkins - seriously? This particular \"customer service\" explains why Mr Sub franchises are diminishing and dying over time. Here's cheers to Subways for staying, \"always fresh\" and offering outstanding services."}
{"text":"Awesome hangout; LLBO, magazines & current newspapers, widescreen TV, auto mags, full fresh salad bar w/ complimentary peanuts; quick in and out joint w/ extremely close proximity parking!!! The service in this particular sub-shop is very personable and friendly as well."}
{"text":"That was the most pathetic sub i have ever had.  Skimpy on the meat, and toppings, it was like bread and mustard.  I've been here before and its been OK but today it seems like everything just went down hill.  OK so the bread was fresh.  But i feel like even though it was a 12\" sub it didnt even have enough meat and toppings to be 6\".  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best location to pick up a healthy lunch or dinner. They make the best Veggie and Cheese sub. They put just the right amount of toppings, cheese, and sauce. The staff is very friendly and work to make sure your sub is just how you like it. They even toast my sub right away if I ask them to do so. For a healthy yet delicious lunch or dinner, this is the sandwich that I'd recommend:

12 inch whole wheat bread (toasted) with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, green peppers, onions, salt/pepper, secret sauce and the tzatziki sauce."}
{"text":"This is one of my weekday lunch spots when I'm on the go. They get my order right every time, they are friendly and they move fast at lunch. What else do you need to know?"}
{"text":"Please note since April 2017, this location is now closed. Building is being torn down to make way for a new high-rise condo."}
{"text":"Great Mr. Sub location located at the intersection of College and Spadina Streets.  Same menu fare as other locations, however, this location does not participate in the chain's Bon App's loyalty program (https://mrsub.ca/bon-app-rewards/). Sizeable dining space and quicker service than the next closest location @ Dundas & University add extra points to this location."}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and came across this Mr. Sub while driving home one day. 
This location is large, bright and clean. 
Subs were delicious - toppings were fresh and the bread was soft and tasty. 
Fast, friendly service as well."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this Mr. Sub since I was a kid.  It has instilled upon me the ideology that Mr.Sub is superior to Subway.  Mr.Sub tastes what a sandwich is supposed to taste like, whereas Subway tastes like a fake sandwich.

This location is across from UHS, and so I'm sure they get a lot of business from those high school students.  Fortunately, their student discount extends to university students as well - you just need to flash your student ID to the owner and you can get a 6\" sub + pop for $5.

Personally, I enjoy their classic assorted cold cut combo sub - you can't go wrong.  Add some fresh veggies, mayo, and sub sauce and you get the perfect sub."}
{"text":"Loaded the topping Very messy very sloppy work, didn't bother to toast my sub. Their chicken was in so much oil and water there was no sauce on it. I love mr.sub but stay away from this location"}
{"text":"It was a rainy day and I was forced to take my lunch hour a little early. Scoping out the area I saw that this Mr. Sub was rated 5 stars, and I haven't eaten at one in years. The restaurant is clean so I gave a star for that. And the worker was cool and chill so I gave another star for that. I guess what I'm trying to say is.. SUBWAY/BANH MI FTW!"}
{"text":"Ignore the old reviews.  This place is under new management and the new owner and staff are excellent.  The product is always fresh,  the place is always clean and the staff is always courteous and friendly!"}
{"text":"Not worth the price, wait, or probable health risks.

They constantly try to changing their prices and deals without changing their signage (not surprisingly, only an issue when their prices increase. Hmmmm... #bait&switch).  They \"recently\" (over a week ago) removed all of their daily specials, but have yet to remove the signs that clearly indicate the wrong price.

I would have complained, if the sandwiches were actually good enough to stomach. Not worth it for the stale bread and gross looking toppings."}
{"text":"Mr. Sub, to me, is \"the original\".  I'm a pretty big sandwich fan, and I enjoy \"the competitors\" subs as well.  However, every time I am in a Mr. Sub, it brings me back to eating sub sandwiches back in public school in Northwestern Ontario, where Mr. Sub was the only option.

To me, Mr. Sub is \"comfort food\".  

I have frequented the Mr. Sub on Macleod Trail a few times, the truth is, it is no better, or worse than any Mr. Sub I have been in, simply because this franchise is consistent.  I can get teh same sandwich at any of them, and it will likely taste exactly the same.

However, a few things about this individual location that I would like to share:

- I went in there on St. Patrick's Day, and the guy who made my sub was polite and efficient.  
- The cashier, who was not preparing any food was totally decked out for St. Patty's Day.  She was in a full out hallowe'en costume, complete with wig, long fake gold costume nails, and a green dress.  Her spirit was absolutely wicked!  
- This subway has lots of parking, and is rarely busy.  Two reasons why I like this location.  I can get in and get out with my sammy in tow.
- It was clean.  I was not afraid to eat there.

Way to go, Mr. Sub!  Thanks for holding steady in the year 2011, where there are many competitors. You've been around long time!"}
{"text":"Always consistent.   Very friendly and accommodating staff, as well.  A previous reviewer compared to Subway.   Yes - there are similarities but Mr. Sub knocks it out of the park in comparison.  Wayyyy better.  That's my opinion at least .... and I'm standing by it!"}
{"text":"I tend to visit this Mr sub at least once a month. I have found that the food is good and the service is amazing. They never rush anyone and are so polite!!! There is almost never a line up and if there is, the staff are helpful and quick with each guest. I highly suggest you visit this place if your hungry for Mr sub."}
{"text":"Owner/operator was comical.  I asked for an assorted sub and he prompted me for nothing.
Started putting the meat on etc...and wrapping it without asking about toppings!
I kid you not!.  I asked for my toppings and he said \"why didn't you ask for them earlier?\"

I laughed and walked out."}
{"text":"Maybe it was a one-time thing, but my roast beef sub had a miesy 8 half slices, not whole slices of meat. Since I can't have cheese, no extra meat was offered nor allowed. Next time, I will have to ask for the cheese to throw away."}
{"text":"Why did I neglect the meatball sub for so long whyyyyyy!!!

Its like a hybrid of a sloppy Joe in ball shaped meat format. I used to be all about that spicy chicken but last night changed my mind no doubt. Being open late is a great thing as not many places stay open past 11, this is an advantage that the Mister of Subz has, not to mention I find its ingredients better tasting then its counterpart (Subway). At this location the people making your sub get the job done in a quick and organized manner, *I swear one guy last night made 3 sub's for me , annnd grilled them and was like 5 mins tops in time* This is my Sub spot unless something else comes out that is like a non chain mom n pop place that blows my face off, this is sub zone for me. Go here."}
{"text":"I prefer Mr. Sub as a sandwich chain over Subway but this particular location stands above most others. The owners are (I believe) a husband and wife that work VERY hard ensuring that the food is as good as they can make it and that their customers are very well taken care of.

Obviously Mr. Sub is a Canadian tradition, but if you're in the mood for it, try to make a point of going to this particular location. The owners very much deserve it."}
{"text":"Every time we come to visit Calgary we like coming here to enjoy Mr Sub the way my husband recalled from his youth. Yes there has been changes to the menu but the classics are the same and the people are always friendly!"}
{"text":"Delish subs loaded with toppings. Can't complain.  The staff are super friendly and don't turn up their noses if you ask for extra toppings. Cheaper than subway too."}
{"text":"Good sub place. Wraps also.   Had the smoked meat and it was good. Loved the bread. Also had the Thai wrap with chicken. It was also good. Would come back. Different from subway."}
{"text":"Best sub place in town. I typically won't eat at a Mr Sub but this is an exception."}
{"text":"Limited seating, limited parking, and gets crowded during 6pm. The service is amazing. The sub is also amazing! The area is clean and tidy! Only One vegetarian type of sub which sucks but it's very toasted especially when toasted!"}
{"text":"Great location, great food, and great service! Very spacious area with a ton of parking space! There are many tables for people to sit at and looks like if it was super busy everyone would pretty much get a seat. There are two widescreen TVs which plays current games going on or the news. 

The subs here are really good especially cause of its toppings! I'm not sure if all locations have the bruschetta and pineapple options as toppings but this place does! The service was fast and the place itself is really clean. All the toppings looked fresh which I appreciated. The Guy behind the counter was super nice and I actually feel bad that he was the only one that had to work that night since it was getting a little busy. He definitely had it under control though! The sub was super tasty."}
{"text":"I'm so used to going to subway that when I went to Mr. sub, I forgot how good their subs were! I got a veggie 12inch sub. The mushrooms are the best!!!!!! I also got it toasted which added to the taste! I like how friendly the workers were and  helpful they were. Great place to go!"}
{"text":"Overall, I had a really good experience at this location. The staff were nice and friendly, which I liked a lot. The location itself is very spacious and there are many seats for people to sit at. The menu is located at the top and is clear for everyone to see. I like to help clean the location was and how everything was organized. Their toppings stations were cleans and looked fresh as well. The girl who made my sub was not stingy with the mushrooms when I said wanted extra mushrooms which I loved! Most locations can be stingy. Overall, the sub was good, tasty, and healthy!"}
{"text":"I am a regular for years here, I have been eating the Vegetarian Sub here for over 26 years, can't believe I'm not tired of it, love the secret sub sauce, which is a italian dressing, and pineapple, which is hidden in the fridge, it makes my sub complete, so I have get the multigrain bread, double cheese, onion, lettuce, tomato, banana peppers, and pineapple with Secret sub sauce, and a touch of salt and pepper. My masterpiece, so basicly I have to say that I love mr.sub...it's always pleasing and makes me complete!!"}
{"text":"There are tastier subs like quiznos or thi thi but at this place the owner remembers me no matter how often I come. She asks me about my life and has a positive attitude. The employees remember me and know how I like my subs. The ingredients always look fresh and the soup is never more than a day old unlike some other places. Respect and service goes a long way with me."}
{"text":"Standard sub with a twist of amazing service!

Ordered an assorted sandwich on white bread. Extra onions and mushrooms. The sandwich maker obliged with no fuss. Not busy, great service. 

I like my subs basic and this location delivered an exceptional sub. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best Mr Sub in the world. They saved my life when Tim Hortons had no soup. I will never eat at another restaurant again."}
{"text":"Really good Mr. Sub.
Lots of seating and place was super clean.
I had a spicy chicken sub and it was really good.

Nice change from the Subway on every other corner in Markham."}
{"text":"Worst place to ever go to! Would give it 0 stars if i could..the manager of this establishment is a complete old ass miserable man! He bought it over from the original owner maybe 10 years ago. This location was prime back in the days use to get over 1000+ people a day there, now id say less than 20 don't know why it's still open. I went in with my dad we figured we'll share a sub since a whole one is so much. When we walked in we were looking at the menu for maybe a minute and he was behind the counter staring at us .. made me feel a bit rushed but whatever, he started making our sub.. now remember one side is mine and the other side of the sub is my dad's. As we were telling him what to put on our sub ... since he is behind the counter to MAKE PEOPLE SUBS WHICH IS HIS JOB!! that's all he is there to do is make people's sandwiches accordingly. I said can you also add mustard .. and he looks up at us with a nasty attitude like he got pissed off or something and says *alright alright enough is that enough*. Completely made me and my dad feel stupid that we were asking him for to much, when he was wrapping it I said can you cut it in half & OMFG wish I didn't even ask that. He got so pissed off said why didn't I ask before. Let me tell you that was the worst experience I ever had buying something in my life. Getting food from a store of such a negative person the food might as well of been poisoned. The sub which I only had a bite of was complete garbage , dry , stale bread and his ingredients are old. When I got on the website I wasnt surprised to see the horrible reviews about the guy and the place. Couple of people even said they paid for their food and he wouldn't give it to them .. that's crazy !!! Screw this mr sub and the subway across the street from them. If you want a traditional authentic submarine then I advise going to Morningside & Sheppard to this place tucked in the corner called chubby subs ! Chubby subs is amazing all fresh ingredients, amazing selection, the manager even make fresh jerk chicken and grilled chicken for the subs & and amazing staff. Go to chubby submarines instead !!"}
{"text":"Passing by Mr. Sub the other day and thought to myself \"Man i really havent had a sub in a while\". Plus i havent had mr.sub in a long ass time since subway became all big and bad. 

Got the classic assorted sub and a drink. Hey a classic never dies, right? 
But i did notice they didnt have mushrooms as a topping, WTF? I haven't had mushrooms in a sub for ages. I remember how good their subs were growing up as a kid. Though When i ate my sub, i remember them tasting them a little better. For $10 though, its not that bad. 

Whatever you do, do not get their greek souvlaki chicken sub, got that once. Chicken tasted like cardboard."}
{"text":"this began with me asking for a large bowl of chili, then I was told that they do not carry chili because Tim Hortons was too close.   Next, I asked for a Canadian club. Then, I was told that the bacon had not arrived yet on the truck. So, I asked for anything else that may not be on the menu. I was then told by the surly lady behind the counter that everything else was on the menu. Then, I asked for a egg salad sandwich. To which she responded that they don't have egg salad as they don't sell enough. So, I asked for just a ham sandwich (which by the way was marginal at best). Lastly I looked at the Potato Chip selection and wanted plain potato chips however, there was none so I had salt and vinegar chips. Might want to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today, I think more out of nostalgia than anything since it's probably been more than 20 years since I've had a Mr sub. I had a club on greek bread, and it was ok. Not bad but not good. Probably won't be back.

 Funny how most major cities you can find great sandwich spots all over, and I can think of maybe 2 places in Calgary."}
{"text":"Even with the bad reviews I went to try this place out. Says open till 11 but closed at 1020 with terrible dismissive attitudes by the staff there. 100% save your time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"On of my favourite sub sandwiches. Tuna on the menu for today's special. Love it. Great service, quick with real panini grill."}
{"text":"It's just a sub place, nothing special, right? But I was pleasantly surprised by the sandwich I ordered. It was the special of the day, so a bit cheaper than their ordinary run; it was heated well (chicken was involved), and I was able to get it loaded with all kinds of vegetables, including mushrooms, which they don't have at Subway! The bread and the sandwich elements were all fresh, and I was satisfied. Strongly recommended when you want a sub!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and sometimes go here for lunch. Got to waste 15 mins here and left with no sandwich. Rushed to get food elsewhere with what time I had left. Woman was on her cellphone (not even the work phone) and didn't acknowledge me when I came in, then halfway(?) through her call she looked over and said sorry, but continued to talk. It sounded like the phone call wasn't going to end anytime soon.

When I DO manage to get service, it's normally slow, delayed (no one comes rushing out to greet me, I have to wait a bit for someone to come out of the back) and bread is normally awful."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  The owners are pretty nice to the customers.  They have their regulars that come in.

Fresh toppings! Good service! Place is pretty clean.  Only a couple of tables inside.

Parking is a bit limited.

Otherwise 4-4.5 stars for this location."}
{"text":"One of the few Mr Subs that is proudly owned and operated .  They really seem to care and very friendly. Fresh toppings and great service. . I'm eating a sub in the parking lot while I write this.  Yum."}
{"text":"This is the worst Mr. Sub I have ever been to. I just came back from this location about 5 minutes ago it is about 2:00 pm on May 3rd, 2018 as I work close. This lady who works here is the cheapest employee I have ever met in my life, she did not even cover my sub with all the toppings I want on she would put one on skip a spot then the next. I asked for extra banana peppers as I love hot food and she put 5 on my sub I counted.. I asked her to put extra on she put anther 3.. this same event happened to me 3 months ago I thought I would give it another chance but same thing happened. I pay the same money as everyone else so I expect to have y sandwich made the way I like it. I went to go as the lady for a couple more and she cut me off and said \"what sauce you want\" did not even let me finish. I don't know who she is.. but the owner of this establishment should really have a word with this employee and if this is under his/her orders then they should learn how to give better service. It is safe to say after my first 2 visits they will be my last. To the lady who served me... you ruined my day you cheap swine."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and have had good service and good subs. Wish there were more Mr Sub as I like them better than Subway."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of eating subs as a kid. I used to live in the Beaches area. Where the Main 64 bus would park itself at the foot of Queen Street East and Wineva was a submarine store. It is no longer there. However, several years later, a Mr Sub opened two blocks away from my old elementary school. My parents would get subs from there.

This Mr Sub is the closest one to my home. It is also the one that I frequent the most.

I typically drop by after work to grab a bite to eat. I love the meatball sub and tend to order that the most. I also love the original sub, as it was the first sub that I ever had.

A few weeks ago, I needed to grab some lunch before heading into the office for the afternoon. I stopped by and got a Canadian club. I wasn't feeling like getting the large and went with the small instead.

I don't normally come here during lunch, so I didn't recognize any of the three staff members. They were all fast at preparing everyone's orders. I paid, got my sub, and headed off to work.

My Canadian club was delicious. It was just the way that I liked it. I love it on whole wheat bread that is fresh and yummy.

I will need to come here after work on Thursdays. My meatball sub is the special for that day and I crave it these days. There are daily specials, so I may give them all a try soon!

{"text":"I have been going to this Mr. Sub for well over 15 years and absolutely love it. It is not just any ordinary Mr. Sub. It's owned and operated by a brother/sister combo who have a passion for quality and customer service. I used to work at the plaza behind them so I ate there often. I have never been to any other sub shop that is cleaner, friendlier or more welcoming than here. You can tell they have a close knit group of loyal customers who return often as they are always asking how things are going with them, how their kids are etc. They both truly care about their customers and the experience and service they provide at this shop. If something isn't up to their standards it's fixed immediately. Even the part time staff are always well trained and very friendly.

They never have to ask me what I want, they have my order memorized, along with many other customers I've seen come in over the years. Most franchised sub shops really skimp on the toppings, but not here. If you ask for extra pickles (which I am the crazy pickle lady), it's never an extra one or two slices. I've been told at other places they can't give more than one or two extra or even give them on the side- ridiculous. You definitely get your monies worth in toppings from here. The bread they make is the best of any Mr. Sub out there and always super soft and fresh. The veggies are never old looking or under ripe- they constantly check all ingredients that go onto your sandwich and toss whatever doesn't look just right. 

I know you're saying- come on, it's only a Mr. Sub- but it really isn't. There isn't enough space to write down how much I appreciate the level of care and service they have given me and everyone I bring there. Customer service is unfortunately getting harder and harder to find, especially genuine and down to earth good service. I truly value someone that takes pride in what they do and goes above and beyond to make your experience enjoyable. The amount of detail they remember about our chats while they make my food blows me away- next time I'm in- so how's the wedding plans going, are you feeling better from that illness you had....how's your mom doing at her new house. They work so hard and I am always telling them to take some time for themselves. I recently moved out of Brampton, but I still drive in to go to my Mr. Sub on Main Street. 

I hope you'll give them a try- tell them the crazy pickle lady sent you- trust me, they'll know who you're talking about lol.... They are the best and deserve to be recognized for the hard work and effort they put forth to make a living. People live to complain but never take 2 min to tell someone they did a great job, tell them they appreciate their hard work and great service. You'll never realize how much that can mean to someone who works hard their whole life but never gets to hear the impact it has on another person- whether it's a Mr. Sub sandwich maker, the bus driver or guy who installs your furnace- if someone does a good job, tell them. It shouldn't have to be some huge event for someone to get recognition. Why do we only get off our asses to complain- if someone goes above and beyond, tell them and their boss! They deserve it. Sorry for the rant, but the service industry is so brutal and the people who do a great job never get the recognition they deserve and I'm on a mission to change that!"}
{"text":"My favourite Sub shop in Toronto. Great staff. Great, fresh subs. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"This franchise is just ok.. I went there only because around that area there are not so many options to eat.. I was a little disappointed, because I don't think a sub could be really bad. And even, when mine was not horrible, it was not good... I had the BBQ ribs sandwich, and in my opinion the ribs  were too greasy..  I know that is difficult to have a healthy sub, but this one was more unhealthy than they normally are... 

I am not going to say I will never go back there, but certainly, I will try to avoid this franchise as much as I can.."}
{"text":".As the other review states this is now under new management.  The new owners name is Shawn.  He is extremely friendly and accommodating.  The day before Christmas 2017 he did an extraordinary act of generosity.  He gave away made to order classic submarines and bottled water all day to all comers.  He did not accept payment at all.  Myself and my wife went before noon and a friend went at 5 pm and he was still at it.
I really thought this was fabulous and that a Charlie Brown Christmas would be proud of him.  This will be my Sub of choice as long as he is running it.

Thank You Shawn
Ps.  I have no connection with Mr. Sub in any way other than as a grateful customer for his kindness to the community."}
{"text":"The couple of times I've popped in here for lunch I have been pleasantly surprised at how engaging the staff have been. A nice friendly greeting upon arriving, great service through the ordering process, and a \"thank-you\" when leaving.

The food is average for a chain sub shop but the service here bumps things up in my book."}
{"text":"Very poor, unfriendly service and attitude, owner tries to skim on ingredients. No offer to toast or heat your sub, takes your money and hands you the sub without so much as a thank you or even looks at you. Ordered the double stacked smoked meat and looking at what I got I hate to see what the regular looks like."}
{"text":"This store has been around for ever! After the bar Nags head north in the 1990's . This was the place! The two brothers still own the store and food is always fresh. My only problem is some of the hours that there open but when they are I definitely return when I'm hungry!"}
