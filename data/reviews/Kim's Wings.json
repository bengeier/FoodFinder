{"text":"Kims Wings is a true institution in Cleveland's Glenville and Collinwood areas, being very popular amongst High School students. Years later, Kims Wings is still a favorite with current students, their parents, grand- parents, and their great-grand parents. 

Although they are a bit pricey, Kims has some of the tastiest chicken wings in Cleveland. Maybe its the sauce? Also, their Barbecue is fall-off-the bone delicious, and they offer a great selection of cakes."}
{"text":"I hope their BBQ is better than their wings and fish. The fish and shrimp are frozen and covered in batter without any taste. The chicken wings tastes like they were frozen also without any flavor. The peach cobbler was the only good thing out of it. I'm kinda mad I wasted my gas to drive thirty minutes for this low grade food"}
{"text":"Best wings in Cleveland!!! Been around for over 40 years so they have to be doing something right! They're sauce is bottled and sold all over the country!!! So many people LOVE it! The wings are battered and so delicious and you have a choice between their mild BBQ or hot buffalo which is not your normal buffalo sauce but is so good. The fact that they change their grease on a more regular basis than usual stands to reason why the wings are so fresh and OMG!!!! The polish boys are amazing especially the beef ones!!!! They have many other choices on their menu as well that are really really good!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the perch dinner only.  I've had two now both with macaroni and cheese and greens.  The fish is seasoned well and cripsy, not greasy at all.  Macaroni and cheese is good and the greens are seasoned well.  When I come back in town, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Its ok not one of my favorite bbq places I'm the type of person who love a lot of sauce on my bbq food and I don't get it there......ill choose b&m's and open pitt over them any day"}
{"text":"Pretty good. The sauce is like a boss sauce that is sold in new York."}
{"text":"I try to go to here every time I'm on this side of town which has been twice in 5 months. I love the wings. They are the best I've had in a very long time.  I recently got a rib/wing combo. The ribs were ok. Pretty run of the mill. People were ordering polish boys and lots of wings in big quantities.  The coleslaw was good and complemented the rest of the meal."}
{"text":"I so prefer Open Pitt over Kim's Wings. I stopped by here last weekend and left out because it was crowded and no one was at the window taking orders. I instead called in my order and came back. The sauce is okay, but my big issue when ordering wings is when feathers are left on the wings, which is exactly what I got here. What a disappointment to know they don't take the time to clean their wings, makes me wonder what else they don't take the time to clean."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. My cheesesteak was so soaked in grease the bun was shriveled like my fingers get when I stay in a pool too long. If you want to die of a heart attack,  I highly recommend eating at kims!"}
{"text":"I was passing through the neighborhood when I decided to stop and grab some food. I ordered fries with sauce and they were terrible. Customer service was blah so needless to say there's no need for me to return."}
{"text":"I have lived in Cleveland for all of my life and have seen bar-b-que come and go throughout the years.  To say, that I've been going to Kim's Wings for years, mostly the location at 14909 Saint Clair.  I always order the same thing a \"wing dinner\" w/ extra order of cole slaw, and I've alway's been satisfied with their wings.  They are served hot, and cripsy w/ sauce and not drowning in it, for a reasonable price. $!  

Then I go to the location in Euclid.   Everytime I go to the Euclid location-I order the same 'wing dinner,' and it's like night, and day.  Last week, on the 1st, I stopped in to get the usual, and I was very disappointed when I opened my dinner, after I got home to find over-battered, soggy wings, drownned in a watered-down sauce, and 'limp' soggy, french fries downned in the same. My friend ordered the rib tip combo, and a shoulder sandwich.  The shoulder was not 'pulled' pork but sliced.  It did not have a smoked flavor, and tasted old, and tough.  Same with the rib tips--nothing but a bad tasting grissle.  

I wanted desert, however, I noticed that the cakes are now being sold for $3 bucks per slice, and the slices have shrunk (been cut) noticiabley about1/3 the size that I remember.  Passed on that one!....

I am writing this review because I have never had to throw out a bar-b-que dinner in my life!  What's up Kim with your Euclid location?"}
{"text":"If you are looking for good ribs this is a great spot to go. Their price is low and the sauce they use on the ribs and fries is really tasty. 

I also got their wings and they are pretty good. Not the best i've got but definitely good stuff.

Not something i would recommend for your diet but if its a once in a while thing for sure use this as your cheat day. Tons of calories but delicious taste.

You will find my meal attached to this review. I hope this makes you hungry!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE at the Willoughby location. I called to place an order and was put on hold for 5 minutes without even being greeted. Then I hung up and called back several times for them to still have the phone off the hook. I took it upon myself to go up there and I asked if they still had the phone off the hook and the girl at the cashier said \"no\" while she went to hang up the phone. As soon as she did the phone started to ring. She didn't apologize at all. Two minutes later another customer came in and asked was phone ok because it's been busy for a while."}
{"text":"I've been eating wings since I was five years old in Buffalo New York, I've had wings in many different states this is the first time I've ever thrown away and order of wings.  FYI: the wings are battered\" and their \"hot sauce \" is a barbecue sauce with black pepper flakes just gross the owner was very nice and her mother as well,
Kim explained the menu to me and I figured I would give it a shot...after picking through the batter to get to the wing it was cooked well but just lacked flavor no wing should be treated like this ever. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I will say I been going here for years and years.The service is fast and efficient for the volume of business they do.I will suggest the rib tips,catfish, or just the wings with sauce.The sides are very good the mac n cheese and collard greens(real not out the can) are what I usually get.They have a very good selection of cakes and pies that will keep you coming back and back and back.I will say if your ever in Collinwood and wants something good to eat give Kim's Wings a try you wont be leave with a empty stomach."}
{"text":"Not that great, they only have plain & BBQ. I mean, come on, we need a little more than just BBQ. Also, pricing is average, nothin' special."}
{"text":"By far the most delicious breaded wings I have ever had in my life. I was skeptical at first but the staff and the food was amazing and that sauce OMG. I am officially a fan of breaded wings!. The fried okra and mac and cheese were just OK...but did I mention they have the best wings on earth!? And they are whole wings. This is definitely a place I will visit again the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Kim's wings and sauce have consistently been good. They will always have a customer in me as long as they continue to provide good food, nice portions, and fair prices. 
The line is usually long whenever I go and so is the wait. Even ordering in advance, you still have to wait in one line (worth it though), so have patience or you'll be annoyed. 
It would be helpful for pick up line and an order line so that those that call in can pay, pick up, and leave without having to wait in the long lines behind people that are undecided on their order. 
The service is nice. I've always had pleasant service and my order is always right."}
{"text":"The wings are great! The food is cheap and the service is good.  The wing dinner is delicious and you get so much food... Wings, fries, coleslaw, and bread.  If you need something sweet try the peach cobbler.  The staff is friendly, the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Mrs. Kim & Her FAMILIES, has been in The Collinwood Community, for over 30yrs. When they first started, their barques ribs and chicken wings are so very good. That my families and others in the neighborhood, we was going back to back to, pick up order. That's because the secret Barbecue  Sauces, that was home made. Still to this day, Kim's Wing's is The BEST BARBECUE; PICK-UP or EAT-IN, RESTAURANT N COLLINWOOD COMMUNITY, also N, THE CITY OF CLEVELAND, OHIO.  (216)/(44110)."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! The chicken wings are my favorite. The ribs are very good l love thi place. Kee9 up the good work!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings and sauce I've ever tasted! I used to order the sauce in plastic tubs.But they bottle the sauce now. YAY!
Crispy crispy WHOLE WINGS..not that drummet BS. THE WHOLE wing. An order of five with a slice of bread and fries and coleslaw will usually get the job done for me. Others seem to enjoy their ribs and polish boys as well. But I don't eat pork. Also much friendlier service than they used to have. There was a mean old lady who used to be at the register. Never smiled always made me feel like I was disturbing her. But she doesn't run the register anymore.

This place is primarily for take out. Although they DO have one or two small tables I rarely see anyone sit at them and eat.

My one complaint is that they are SLOW as molasses with anything but a small order of food. I go there whenever I'm home to visit my folks in Ohio. Took an out of town friend here once. Not a big wing fan..that is until he got ahold of a few of these Kim's Wings with sauce!! Boy tried to eat ALL MY WINGS!! I had to pimp-slap him to protect my dinner! The boy is now a Kim's Wings addict!

btw- These wings are of the sweet and tangy variety. Not spicy at all. Just fyi for the buffalo enthusiasts. If you're looking for that this may not be your place. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and head over to Kim's and treat your tongue to an orgasm of flavor! YES!!"}
{"text":"I am very very VERY DISAPPOINTED in the size of these beef polish boys from Kims Wings on St. Clair. They are so small my past  few visits to this establishments."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. I like there wings but I had a taste for a  polish boy the bread was hard. And after waiting for my food all that time had to throw it away. Just eat there wings but be prepared to wait"}
{"text":"I grew up eating here, but I live in Philly now. Whenever I touch down the 1st place I stop is here. Same great food same great taste. I've been thinking about a Polish Boy for three weeks now . It was so good . Gotta stop back by before I leave."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Always cooked perfectly and sometimes they give you extra wings! Love the sauce and cakes too!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My husband is from Cleveland.  So I make him bring me here everytime I visit."}
{"text":"My hubby stops at least twice a month to get me a polish boy meal. The meal is consistently good. The bbq sauce they make in house is really delicious too! For some reason I'm craving Kim's right now (could be the preggo hormones). I think I should make plans to have it for lunch tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Passing thru on my way to Chicago and the front desk person recommended Kim's. I was not disappointed. We got a couple of wing dinners with no sauce and peach cobbler. Everything was superb including the fries and Cole slaw.   Next time I will get double dipped wings as recommended by one of the regulars.  Maybe we will stop by on the way back home. St Claire Ave is the joint."}
{"text":"For such a busy establishment the service was extremely fast and very efficient. The wings were great  could have used a little more sauce especially since I asked for extra sauce. But overall I was pleased with my food. I still prefer B&Ms but I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I left Cleveland back in 1991 however whenever I come home Kim's is the 1st place I hit."}
{"text":"I love it, I've been coming here for like over half my life and they never disappoint"}
{"text":"Went to Kim's tonight for the wings. The food is okay but the service sucks. Too crowded, I had to wait and ask if I could place an order. They need one person to take orders and then have that same person giving customers their food.  The individuals filling the orders should not be the same ones answering the phone or taking orders. Even if you call the order in, if its a large wing order they won't fill the order until you get there. I will still go to Kim's but it would nice if they can conduct business in a more efficient and orderly fashion. It would nice if they could expand the Lakeshore location."}
{"text":"Chicken wing dinner with double fries and Tahitian Treat! Delicious. It's a staple when I visit Cleveland. Don't plan on eating in...take it to go."}
{"text":"Authentic soul food with a dude that will sell you bootleg DVDs out front. 

I got a shoulder sandwich, served on white bread and it was on point. Collard greens, probably very little nutritional value but great flavor. 

I didn't buy any DVDs but available titles include Fast & Furious 7, 50 Shades of Gray, and Avengers."}
{"text":"I'm almost always disappointed when I go to this location. They always seem to forget to include everything that I order and pay for, then when I let them know that something is missing, they get an attitude with me and I have to wait an extra 10 minutes. Will try them again in another few months to see if things have gotten better."}
{"text":"Cleveland's best kept secret. Not only do they have the best wings I've ever had, but their caramel cake is amazing. I wish they delivered."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Kims for years and it is the bomb .The food is reasonably priced and they have a nice selection of dinners . My favorite is the rib tip combo 7.50 its alot of food .Call in orders are not good when there busy its more of the type of place you walk in order and wait iys worth the wait . Try the German chocalate cake its to die for . Kudos to Kims and friendly staff."}
{"text":"If they close at 11:30 and they tell you that they don't take phone in orders after 10:30, do not come here unless you like under cooked chicken and food poisoning."}
{"text":"A lot of people love Kim's Wings. I think they are just alright. I prefer regular Buffalo wings without breading if I am going to eat chicken wings with hot sauce. Something also bothers me about the little wing. Not the beautiful song by Jimi Hendrix, the actual little wing part they leave on."}
{"text":"One of the things I always make sure I do when I come home to Cleveland is stop somewhere and get a polish boy.. I normally stop in Kim's because it close to my mothers house and I know I won't be disappointed. The polish boys here are just what I need for that taste of Cleveland while I'm here! They have the perfect amount of sauce and fries. The only reason I deducted a star is because this time I got wings and while I may not be the best judge since I don't really eat a lot of fried chicken, the wings weren't anything special.. I actually got two and couldn't even finish them both.. 

As far as decor it's not much to it.. It's enough wait space for you to wait while your takeout is ordered and you order over a mic through a plexiglass window."}
{"text":"Stopped in for my routine polish boy when i last visited town and i was not disappointed!  The food was great (as expected) and the service was quick. in and out in no time!"}
{"text":"Overall great food. Service great.
Clean.
Parking is good. 
Chicken sometimes has to much batter."}
{"text":"The food is hit or miss some day good some days bad but overall decent for the price the fish is the best of u get it on a hit day...lol"}
