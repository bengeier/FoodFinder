{"text":"Love this restaurant!
Portions are huge but I went with a group of 5 and the guys finished off my plate no problem! Lol
I had the ribs and they were cooked to perfection. I asked the. To through it on the grill for a minute to crisp up the outside of it while I was ordering and the chef did it perfectly. I am very picky when it comes to ribs btw and have never been overly impressed till now. So a tip if you like them a bit crisp or charred is to just ask them to put it on the grill. 
My friend got the pulled pork sandwich and it was so tender, he loved it. 2 of the guys got the brisket and they said it was to die for (nothing left on the plate) my one friend got the catfish and loved it as well.
The fries that came with the meals were nice and crisp, just how I like them. The slaw was fantastic. I didn't try the beans because I was so full.
The pork fries are so damn good as well as the dip(can't remember why it's called)
Of course the homemade doughnuts are fantastic!! 

My only problem was that there were 5 of us in a small 4 person booth. Very cramped 

The food made us forgets about that, so bravo, 5 stars"}
{"text":"Saw the Montreal smoked meat on the menu and needed to go in to try. Lived in Montreal for years and since I moved back I realize how poor a job Toronto does of the smoked meat. Stack however got it very right. Best smoked meat ive had in Toronto (though they overdid the bread a little going high end multigrain instead of plain ole rye). Rest of the menu looked good but I haven't been back yet."}
{"text":"There is nothing more disappointing than going to a restaurant you were dying try and having it not live up to expectations.  The macaroni and cheese was basically a soup of kraft dinner style white cheese and panko bits.  The ribs and chicken were dry.  The good parts?  Fries, decent sauces and comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Meat was soft & tender. Nice drink selection, and yummy desserts.

There was a lot of children around so if you're looking for an adult night restaurant, this may not work for you."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch since it's close to my work.  Everything is delicious - the pulled pork sandwich is a sure bet, burgers are SO good, and the ribs are saucy and tender (although not my favourite thing on the menu).  

Service is friendly and attentive, but being a sit down restaurant, it's better for a long Friday lunch rather than a quick lunch during the week. For dinner on weekends, come early as they don't take reservations and it's usually quite busy. There are lots of tvs around to watch sports here too."}
{"text":"I had the brisket and slaw sandwich, parmesan fries, and the mini donuts with strawberry sauce.  The brisket sandwich was excellent it was a nice combination of smokey and sweet nice ratio of meat to slaw and bun, the only criticism would be if the bun was a little warm or toasted it would be even better.  The Parmesan fries were really awesome I will be coming back here especially to have these again. The mini donuts were ok but will probably skip them next time.  The restaurant layout and atmosphere is very comfortable and inviting.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I was expecting a mediocre burger and some fries. Literally the best meat I've ever tasted. I wolfed the whole thing down. Kinda sucks that fries aren't included and are extra but whatever. Guy at the front desk was super lovely"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for my birthday lunch for a few reasons: 
It's BBQ which I love and I have been meaning to check it out and thought birthdays should be about doing something new so here we go:
The restaurant is beautiful, it's very large and the washroom are impeccable! 
We decided to order a salad with a side of their pulled chicken and their brisket with slaw. The verdict: very good! The brisket was so tender and filled with that smokey BBQ flavour of their Jack Daniels and the same goes for the pulled chicken, surprisingly it had a lot of flavour and it was juicy which I always fear with getting chicken that it can be dry. 
We also decided to get an order of their coleslaw and man, it was on point! Definitely a mayo based dressing but it was packing good seasoning! 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here and was not surprised with how good the food and especially DESSERT was. The food hands down, outstanding. We ordered the giant platter, with ribs, chicken, smoked meat, basically everything. The service on the other hand, was horrible. Our waiter was cranky and rude, and did not respect our requests. Possibly if we got a better waiter, the whole experience would've been more enjoyable. How did that woman get hired??"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The restaurant was very nice, elegant and clean, and the servers were very polite and attentive. Parking is limited, however (had to park in a residential area on the side of the road). 

I'd recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a good, solid burger."}
{"text":"Ridiculously delicious food. My husband and I shared the incredible Baby Back ribs with coleslaw, unreal beans and garlicky mashed potatoes. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and found it plenty for the two of us.

Our server was prompt and attentive.

I am a big fan of Caesars, this one was spicy and savoury with a piece of smoked meat instead of celery! I like to get some protein with my drinks!

My husband had the Oreo milkshake, which he guzzled down.

Terrific place, we found it because of Yelp reviews and were very pleased we did."}
{"text":"Burger review only. In a city where there are loads of great burgers and fries, you've really, really got to deliver on a $40 burger combo. Its on the low end of 3 stars overall.

I cant speak to the other dishes, but the burger was just ok. The location is fast/casual BBQ with lots of wood and a fairly bright space. Its like a nicer Carl's Jr with lower ceilings and a bar (in fairness Stack were here first). The bacon and jalape√±o cheeseburger (no side no drink) was 13$. Just let that sink in. I added parmesan fries, which were 8$ and no option for a smaller portion. I've just spent $22 on a burger and fry. Then I had a beer. $30. Tax and tip, $40+. On a burger lunch. I work in the financial district where you can easily drop $20 at mac-sushi so its hard to get my back up about price.

It was a flat-top grilled burger, maybe a little dry on the inside. Decent crust which you can expect on a griddle, not too tightly packed. Not any particularly flavourful cut of beef (the menu doesnt specify) and nothing to brag about texture wise. Garparm fries were good, but they didnt quite satisfy in that garlicky, cheesy, overflavoured way I half expected them too. It could be that I go for that sort of thing a little bit more than others though.

Just an average burger. Kind of insane on the price. For that reason, I would reccomend Burger cellar down the street for dinner (where your money gets you something), or burgers priest down the street which isnt my favourite but for lunch is quick and half the price and just as good if not better."}
{"text":"Great food. Very nice portions the smoked brisket was amazing and Andrea have us very good service. 
We will come again for sure"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because we were in the mood for bbq.  Nice place, good atmosphere, service was great.  Ordered the Oreo milkshake and the beef brisket.  On the pricey side for the portion of meat, a little small, but the bbq sauce on the brisket was really tasty.  I wouldn't say that this a must try but if you're in the area and in the mood for bbq brisket, definitely check them out. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Amazing ribs! The meat was tender and incredibly tasty. I really like the house-made smoked beans."}
{"text":"I live in the area and Texas BBQ is my favourite style food.  I have Texas BBQ every time I visit the state. 

The atmosphere feels trendy:  but they have messed with Texas! 

There are many items on the menu, but only one brisket and two pulled pork regular dishes. But there is a quinoa side, which indicates to me they are trying too hard to appeal to foodies while not getting the main premise right. Nothing about this place feels Texas, or anywhere else in the American South, or BBQ. I had the Lexington pulled pork and I give it one star.  It was slightly better than the zero-star pulled pork I've already reviewed at the Rogers Centre. The second star for this review is because aesthetically this is a nice restaurant that feels more Queen West than Yonge & Lawrence. 

That said, if you want Texas BBQ, I'd go to Phil's Original BBQ at College and Ossington or any place with a bull on the roof in Houston."}
{"text":"Absolutely the rudest staff.  Asked for a table soon because I am handicap and can't stand around and wait. Manager said... oh I am sorry you have a sore knee.  

I was crushed between a car and SUV and both legs were severely crushed and now can't walk.  

Even if they could not accommodate a request you don't treat people like that.

Manager was really arrogant.  If you want BBQ try Barque on Roncy, nice people who appreciate customers and business"}
{"text":"Pulled pork was fantastic. Baked beans were too. Kosher dill was an incredible surprise and the craft beer menu was superb.

Don't forget to top things off with the Stack donuts. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic and inspiring food! Great for food, drinks, good with the kids and service is exceptional! Take great pride in their food and beverages."}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before.

This is probably one of my favourite restaurants of all time. Every time I've come to STACK (20+ times) I've been greeted by an amazing staff and even better food. When this place first opened up, it had that novelty of \"everything being made in-house\" and such. This hasn't faded at all in 2016. This place has the best ribs I've tried in a while as well as just really awesome burgers and stuff off the grill. 

Drinks are always great, and the owner frequently comes out and talks to the diners."}
{"text":"A great place to go for lunch or dinner with the family! Our children love it here! (and the adults enjoy the food as well)"}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars. the food is pretty good i orded the crispy calamari,  ribs and old fashioned donuts with cinnamon sugar.

the calamari was pretty good. it was crispy and served with a sauce that pretty much made the dish. the ribs were a bit dry and stale so I think they were ready before we got there and just warmed up. the rib sauce was super delicious and it really did save the ribs for me. if the ribs were cooked to order it would probably be one of the best ribs because of their sauce. the me came with fries, coleslaw and baked beans which all complimented the ribs. last but not least the donuts. honestly a must try! melt in your mouth perfection. perfect way to end your meal."}
{"text":"Good food, HORRIBLE service. It's really a shame when this happens because it really ruins the whole dining experience. 

I was here with a party of 10 for dinner and when we arrived, the hostess just told us to go upstairs without guiding us. The server who served us showed clear disinterest in serving us. When my friend asked another server for a glass of water because she was choking on her food, the server rudely told her that she needed to wait for her server. Clearly you can see her choking and it's only a glass of water! When we got the bill, we kindly asked our server for separate bills since it was hard to divvy up. She told us very rudely that she couldn't do that and that we should have told her before. Worst part of it all? We were forced to pay the 18% gratuity which we all knew was the norm for big groups, but clearly not for crappy service like this.

I can only give credit to the kitchen for the food, if it wasn't for that, I would give it zero stars. Both the fish and chicken tacos were great. The burgers were juicy and loaded with side of fries. We order the different fries apps as well. The yam fries and cheese fries were very tasty as well. 

This is by far one of the WORST customer service experiences I have had dining in this City. Unless you can put up with horrible service, I would strongly advise not to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff. The food is consistently great and they are very family friendly. Favourites include Santa Fe Chicken sandwich, breakfast burger, mini donuts and the pulled pork.  A place I often chose when out of town visitors come in or for birthdays, where they give you free donuts. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ selections, great staff and inviting atmosphere with lots of room for groups and/or kids with strollers ;)  Very approachable and accommodating when it comes to food allergies too. Save some room for the s'mores mini donuts! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a big fan of smoked meat but I thought I'd give this place a try anyway since it's fairly close to where I live, and I'm glad I did! I went on a Friday night, wait wasn't too long, maybe 10-15min at most. I believe it was the manager whom I was speaking to while I was waiting for my seat was really helpful he was recommending what I should get since I was a little overwhelmed. He recommended the Texas brisket and it was absolutely amazing! I'd never thought I'd enjoy smoked meat that much. The only thing is that the sandwich doesn't come with a side, you need to purchase it separately. 
The service was great overall, we didn't feel rushed though we were there for hours eating and drinking and catching up with a few friends. I would def recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Have to say that the food and service have gotten really good again since Fall 2013.  It seems the smoked meats are not overcooked anymore.  Service is faster.  Wait times are not as long at the door. Not sure what changed exactly, but I'm extremely happy they are back to the good ol' days!

They still have the toy bin for kids which continues to be a big hit.  Much more enjoyable to eat at a restaurant where there are happy sounds and giggles coming from children. :)"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I loved it! Clean and spacious sitting area and our waiter was very helpful and friendly. As an appetizer we got the Smokehouse poutine (fries with pieces of beef brisket, bbq sauce and chipotle ranch) - amazing! I went for the stack brisket  with the medium memphis sauce with their slaw on the side. I was really impressed with their slaw because I don't normally like something too sweet or too tangy, but it tasted great - creamy but not too watery. Sandwich was on point and for dessert the strawberry donuts - soooo worth the wait! Made fresh and tasted like funnel cake. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner once and had \"the platter\", two adults and two kids to share.
It was more than we could eat. It was very tasty and fresh, all meats were prepared to perfection. Service was two stars, it seemed the girl wasn't having a good day.
Also came once for lunch and service was great, fast, food was good(ribs).
The place is beautiful, bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"I would like to express my sincere thanks to Tim, Anna and Charlotte for a wonderful experience this past Sunday. Thank you for making our birthday celebration a huge success! Tim was a wonderful host, he was friendly, professional and extremely accommodating! Anna and Charlotte were very attentive and accommodating. Everyone went above and beyond our expectations!

Our guests loved the restaurant, atmosphere, food and service....there will definitely be repeat customers!

Once again, thank you for everything and most importantly, for a memorable evening!"}
{"text":"Stack is one of the best family friendly restaurants in the Yonge/Lawrence area. The food is great and has a wide variety. The service is always impeccable from really congenial wait staff to friendly managers. We are always left with a smile when we interact with the Stack employees. As a family with two young kids we love coming here for the delicious food and speedy service. Keep it up Stack! We are probably there on a weekly basis :)"}
{"text":"I'm on a barbecue kick right now so I was pretty excited to check out Stack.  My group of  six (4 guys, 2 girls) shared a platter, which usually serves 4, so we also got two orders of fish tacos.

Platter (make sure you check out the posted pic):
Why is the beef brisket covered in sauce? It doesn't make sense. The mac and cheese was tasty but how is that supposed to serve 4 people? The chicken breast was awkward to share since it was a quarter.  The rest was passable... but a forgettable experience.

Dessert:
The Stack Donuts were incredible. Think.... gourmet tiny tom donuts. But better.  The donuts were served hot and tasted great. It was a refreshing change from uninspired store-bought cakes found in other restaurants.


Service:
I was pretty disappointed with the service here.  The platter was served on a single big tray in the middle of the table.  Since the food is just left in the middle (and there isn't a ton of it), you're left with this awkward feeling of whether you can grab more food or whether you should leave more for your friends.  They should try other options like presenting individual meats on separate plate.  Also, refills were hard to come by and wetnaps were nowhere to be seen.

Value: 
Overall.. it was decent value. My portion of the bill was $23 after tax and tip. 

Would I go back again?
Maybe... for the convenience. And for the donuts. I don't think I'll make a special trip there unless I happen to be in the neighbourhood or it happens to be the best spot to meet friends."}
{"text":"Been frequenting this Midtown Smokehouse for about a year. Great lunch or dinner spot if you're looking for a decent burger or BBQ place. They were actually voted in the Top 10 Ribs places in Toronto on Blog TO! And have a great selection of Craft Beers from Ontario Breweries, with two Guest taps for beers not usually carried. 
 
My favourite items on the menu are the Ribs, Texas Brisket Sandwich & Chipotle Burger. The burgers & sandwiches are served solo and you have the options of adding sides like the mouthwatering parmesan fries.

Their poutine is a meal in itself. And you have the option of stacking it with any of their smokehouse meats. Pulled Pork is my go to! If you're looking for lighter fare the Fish Tacos are amazing! (Especially paired with one of the Craft Beers on tap!) 

Feeling hungry? Get the 1/2 Pound Brisket Dinner whch comes with a generous portion of hand cut fries or mash, slaw & molasses  beans. There's also a Stack Platter (feeds 4) featuring the Ribs, Brisket, Pulled Pork & Wings for $75. 

And be sure to wash it down with a Shaketender Surprise! For those not in the know, this is a shake creation by Stack staff and flavours are mixed up week to week. My most recent visit I was treated to a Creamsicle Shaketender. It was the perfect Summer treat!

If you're feeling daring you can do the Stack Challenge! Finish 2 Burgers, 2 plates of Fries and a Shake or Beer under 30 minutes and it's on the house!"}
{"text":"My friend had a table reserved for a table of 6 since it would be busy during lunch time. And yes, Stack gets very busy at lunch time. 

The waiter was very nice but got tedious when we asked for refills of water. 
I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. When the order came out, the presentation was alright. The pulled pork sandwich was very dry and there wasn't enough sauce. The coleslaw tasted slightly odd. 
But...I would have to say that sweet potato fries were the winner of the meal. It's surprising how the side dishes are better than the main dishes! They were crispy on the outside and 'soft' in the inside. The chipotle sauce give the fries a hot and tangy taste which I love. 

All in all, I might come back if I'm in the neighborhood but not to extreme lengths."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 5 on a Saturday night. We were promptly greeted and seated almost immediately - great first impression! The atmosphere is casual, with a sports bar feel and we were seated in close view of the kitchen and smoker area, which gave us high hopes for the authentic BBQ we were about to savour and STACK did not disappoint. The Smoked Baby Back Ribs were tender and truly \"fall off the bone\", I went with the Memphis sauce...deelish. I really wish I had room for the dessert, but the combination of the awesome food and the service will definitely bring me back for a second visit!"}
{"text":"Delicious .... Cozy .... Prices are unreal!!

Got the Lexington pulled pork and my bf got the pulled pork with one of their signature BBQ sauces ... MmmmmMmmmm ... However sandwiches and other entrees do not come with sides, which are extra

Also appetizers are well portioned

Highly recommend getting dessert, especially the Smmmmmores donuts ... Perfect for sharing.

So many options to choose from and staff were great and accommodating.

Was even pleasantly surprised to get loose leaf tea when we ordered it for the end of our meal

Thinking of going here for my birthday"}
{"text":"I had US Thanksgiving dinner last week here and it was amazing.  I booked ahead of time with Noah and he got Chef to come up with off-menu dinner.  We had soup, 2 smoked turkeys, BBQ platter, green beans, mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes and a fruit platter for 16 people and it was DELICOUS.  We also got the chocolate cake.  My guests who had travelled by car from Philly, Connecticut & Jersey were thrilled with the spread.  Still dreaming about it now...."}
{"text":"We journeyed to STACK to try the brisket and were not disappointed. The smell of the smoker from two blocks away brought a smile to my face. The brisket was a bit on the dry side, though the fatty pieces were great. We are in Toronto, so it's hard to hold them to Texas standards on the meat. The BBQ sauces were stellar. 

The excellent and enthusiastic servers and manager made our trek to STACK even more worthwhile. We even got a tour of the smoker. These people take their BBQ seriously."}
{"text":"Went here recently with my friend awhile back an decided to write a review since i'm planning to dine here again.

Customer service is great, unfortunetly I dont know if this is a family restaurant or a franchise but, their food is great! We ordered burgers an they had these special onion bacon deep fried flavored crispy things which were amazing an their fries were freshly cut I presume since it didnt seem packaged. Thier plates are really nice an complements the foods they prepare.

Will come again soon!"}
{"text":"What a great place to meet up with friends for drinks and some Yummy Brisket, Burgers and or Ribs or just go there with the family. 
The Staff were super polite and caring and veeery attentive. 
The food was absolutely to die for. Great portions and super fast too. 

I give it a tripple yyyyeeeeeyyyy"}
{"text":"Sandwich, Calamari (spicy), Fries, Coffee, Service all by good.  Windowed booth was fun for kids to watch the ribs being prepared."}
{"text":"Ok place. 
Burgers do NOT come with any fries/salad and there terribly overpriced. Tasty burgers though. Good beer selection

Nice patio along yonge street. Right beside Gabbys patio so you're facing your cheaper buddies."}
{"text":"The most delicious ribs and brisket experienced in Toronto. The service was outstanding and great craft beers .  The ribs were very meaty and just fell off the bone. We live in Whitby but we will come back for more."}
{"text":"Had the ultimate platter - it had lots of different great stuff. A lot of fries so could have used a little more meat but super tasty. You need to get the mini donuts for dessert!"}
{"text":"Flavourful, juicy and tender back ribs and brisket.  Best we've had since our last trip to Austin Tx.  Server was friendly and attentive.  Nice selection of local craft beers."}
{"text":"We were surprised at how juicy, soft and delicious the smmoked meat sandwich was.  Definitely going back for those!  The ribs came in a very generous portion with plenty of sauce to lick off your fingers! The meat pretty much fell off the bone so it was just perfect.  I also loved their smore's doughnuts - can't stop thinking about that!"}
{"text":"Good decor and service. A bit wait on weekends. They let you wait even though there are tables available. Food is great. Kids coloring crayons are helpful to keep the little one busy."}
{"text":"Came on a quiet wednesday late afternoon for a meal with the kids.  Tried the baby back ribs, beef brisket, cobb salad and the kids mac n cheese.  Since I own my own kamado and have experimented with the low and slow method of cooking ribs and other meats, I was hoping for some amazing ribs.  While the ribs had a decent bit of bark to it, the meat was a bit on the dry side and a little too fall off the bone for my liking (true ribs aficionados do not want their ribs to be fall off the bone which equates to overcooked ribs).  They lathered on too much sweet bbq sauce for my liking and I didn't notice the smokiness that I could get with my own backyard charcoal grilled ribs.  The brisket had a somewhat similar sauce as the ribs, and wasn't anything outstanding.  The cobb salad had fresh ingredients, but the chicken was flavourless.  Mac and cheese was passable for the kids.  Fries were good.  Kitchen was extremely slow as it took them almost 30 mins to serve our dishes when there was only 2-3 tabs for the whole restaurant at 4pm weekday afternoon.  Overall a disappointing meal."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Stack by colleague who dines there regularly.  Stack is located in the Yonge/Lawrence area of Toronto.  They offer an extensive spread of BBQ, both meat and non-meat options. I ordered a non-meat option for dinner so my review is slated from that perspective.

My cajun blackened fish was cooked and seasoned well.  The mashed potatoes were delicious.  My SO got the fish tacos and he said there were ok and much preferred my dish instead.  Their meat menu options looked really good  based on my observations of my fellow diners enjoying their meals at dinner.

The highlight of the meal were the doughnuts!  They were freshly made doughnuts served with different toppings.  Strawberry was my favourite.

They also have a great BEvERage selection.  Service was great; our server was super friendly.

I will definitely be back when I am in the area again to try out the meat options on their menu!"}
{"text":"Burger I had was good!  Big stack burger.  Soo good I stuffed it down in probably 3 minutes.   Burger doesn't come with sides.   Extra moola for that!  Had the Mac and cheese.  It was just ok, according to my Mac n cheese standards.  They also have some sort of burger challenge where you have to eat 2 big stacks, pound of fries and a shake of your choice in under 30 minutes.   The big stack is 1lb of meat.  So probably after the bun, condiments, bacon, cheese etc probably looking at 3lbs for the two burgers.  Approx 5lb meal.   I have no doubt I can destroy this in 20 mins.  I'll be back next time when someone drives me.  No way am I going to attempt to eat this and drive!  Don't eat and drive,  stay alive! 

The s'mores donuts were good!  I was full after the Mac n cheese and burger but had to try it anyways.   The menu is full of food I like to eat!   Need to try the brisket and pulled pork next time.  Friend had the pull pork and said it was good.  The blonde waitress Christine?  I think that was her name?   Cute, friendly, fast, great service!  Give this girl a raise!  That's how service should be."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night around 8:30-9 and there was a line! It took about 20 minutes to get a seat - which was good amount of time to study the menu and pick the order. 

The service was quick and attentive. 

Ordered half rack each (forgot the name of the sauce, but chose one from the the recommended ones) which came with delicious beans, the usual fries, meh coleslaw and juicy ribs. I went in empty stomach after the gym and came out stuffed. 

I am sure there are other great BBQ places, but this is not a bad option around the area!"}
{"text":"Whhhhhhat, a midtown BBQ joint!
With a name like Stack, I had visions of a giant stack of meat.

The ultimate platter ($64) sounded like it would make that vision a reality!
We weren't disappointed! The three of us split:
- Saucy ribs
- Brisket
- Smoked Meat
- Pulled Pork
- Roasted Chicken
- Mac cheese
+giant heap of fries
+slaw
+beans
+mini buns

My favourite items were definitely the ribs and juicy brisket.
Mac cheese was creamy and delicious.
I didn't bother filling up with the minibuns.  

Now, instead of dessert, I got one of their spiked milkshakes.
OMG. Dark rum, toasted marshmellows...graham crackers, chocolate... vanilla...if you are thinking about the Smmmmmore milkshake, do it! :)"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing! Milkshakes to die for, fantastic pulled pork with Memphis sauce, and it goes on and on! Highly recommend! Will definitely be back! Server - Harrison was amazing and patient with our questions about food preparation for the kids."}
{"text":"Oishii!!! Simply excellent BBQ ribs. I don't know if there's fried chicken but I'll have to verify the next time I go. 

The ribs are so tender. They fall off the bones. You have choices between 3 sauces. I love the fries and the beans as well. If you're hungry and are in the mood for BBQ, you can't go wrong with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here last week for a friends birthday. Our server was very friendly even though more than half the people in the group did not show up on time to the reserveration. 

I ordered the tacos and their ribs as the reviews on the ribs seemed pretty high. I enjoyed the tacos more as I felt that their ribs didnt stand out; it felt like I could get it at any rib place.

Overall, I would definitely return to try one of their burgers as it looked pretty good."}
{"text":"I had the same experience as a few other reviewers about the service. I felt that our waitress (brunette with braces) had pushed add ons to us in a deceitful way, without mentioning the multiple extra charges we would find on our bill. For example, she told us we couldn't swap out our sides and that paying for an entirely separate appetizer would be cheaper (it was actually $10 more expensive) and saying that our fries-to- poutine upgrade would be only $3 when it was actually $3.50 plus an extra $5 for meat on top. I know servers are trained to push add-ons, but we genuinely felt tricked and cheated here. On top of that, she was also being selective with her service to tables. There were only 3 in the section tonight and she tended to one party more so than everyone else, bringing them their drinks and appetizers first even though they came in last. She kept asking me if I wanted more water while never actually coming to refill it. 1 star service for a slow night.

I had read on yelp that their brisket was the best. Unfortunately, my $18 half pound texas brisket plate came out cold. The brisket was a bit tough like it had been sitting out for a while - probably because our server was too busy tending to her favored table. My boyfriend ordered ribs and we shared. His ribs were delicious and fall off the bone tender. We both LOVED the beans here and polished off a shared side of mac and cheese together. I wish that the brisket had come out warm and that our server wasn't so sly and deceitful about the prices or this would have been a 4 star meal. Too bad."}
{"text":"Saw STACK on yelp tonight with 4.5 stars and thought we'd check it out. We ordered the build your own (Ribs & Brisket) and the Brisket Burger.  Hands down, no competition, the ribs are the best! We've had our share of BBQ meats in California and these ribs are top quality.  I would have gone 5 stars tonight, but I'm picky about my French fries.  I thought the fries were the \"leftovers\" of the fresh cut fries and they were overcooked.  I'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Blew me away! Was not expecting it to be this good! It was amazing my bf got the brisket burger I tried it... omg I melted into the burger! So good! I had the salmon and sweet potato fries were also good. Our server was amazing! I wish I remembered his name. But he was on point and exceptional service."}
{"text":"I came here once and got the fish tacos, they were really good.

The second time I came there I only came for their donuts... the plain cinnamon one... amazing! So good... This is what I recommend coming here for LOL. Hot and fresh!

But the restaurant is way too crowded with family and kids... which is kind of weird when I see people drinking at the bar?"}
{"text":"I love the platter that we ordered. It has a variety of different kinds of meat, such as ham, wings, roast beef etc., with macaroni and beans."}
{"text":"Too bad I was really looking forward to this place. I have been waiting for 15 minutes and nobody has come to even get my drink order. So I am now walking out!"}
{"text":"I love going to Stack for their ultimate platter. It's the best thing for a small group (I'm usually in a group of 4-5 people) and it gives you a bit of everything. The sauces are amazing, the meat is always tender, and their staff are very friendly and casual. They have a pretty good selection of beer on tap as well. Definitely try the ultimate platter if it's your first time! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went to Stack for dinner on a Saturday night, and the experience was a real mix of highs and lows.  The ribs were really delicious and I enjoyed the cornbread, but the smoked chicken wing appetizer was disappointing and I've had better baked beans and brisket. The servers were all very friendly and attentive, but we were sitting in the corner and there were fruit flies flying around our table for the entire meal.... not a great addition. The atmosphere felt sort of like a Boston Pizza or Swiss Chalet, so maybe better for families and large groups than to impress a date.  

I'd consider going back for the ribs (and a good selection of beer), but not in a big rush."}
{"text":"The restaurant has two levels, I think there were only 3 waitress. We were told it would be 10 to 15 mins wait. Waited 20 minutes, and saw they set up a table. However, the host would rather let you stand by the door with vacant tables inside. She explained the kitchen was too busy, so they would rather leave tables empty......
Food was not bad, but my stomach had a problem with them.
This is review for a visit in June, hope they made some improvement."}
{"text":"Driving uptown after a long shopping trip and I started to randomly crave ribs. My friend mentioned that he's been to Stack before and that they had amazing ribs and burgers.

Walking inside, our waiter Chris greeted us and immediately sat us down. He was made our experience that much better, and you could tell he was really passionate about the food and his job which is great to see. The restaurant is very sleek, clean, and the booths are super comfy. 

I knew immediately that I wanted the baby back ribs and my friend ordered the brisket. We both ordered regular fries, and the plate came with coleslaw, and baked beans. I wish there was a piece of cornbread though! The meat itself was absolutely delicious... I haven't had ribs like that since my trip to the States. My friend also really enjoyed the brisket and the various sauces as well.

You know the food is good when nobody is talking at the table."}
{"text":"If its your first time- get the ultimate platter. ($84) Feeds about 3-4 respectfully. Bbq pulled pork was the best thing on the platter, ribs are great as well as the mac n cheese. Wasn't a fan of the chicken seasoning but none the less- a delicious experience. Good service, fun atmosphere, would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I really love BBQ meats, all types, whatever way you wish to prepare them as long as they taste great.

I've visited Stack twice before writing this review to make sure I have a taste of as much as they offer.

Sadly, I have to say that my favorite thing on the plate is the beans. They're awesome and I really enjoyed them. That's kind of sad for a BBQ restaurant. The mashed potatoes were pretty good as well.

On to the meats:

Brisket : 3/5 A little dry, a little under-seasoned, no smoke ring, just OK.
Ribs : 3/5 Not cooked long enough as they didn't separate perfectly, not a huge fan of the sauce, and really, I had better ribs from amateurs.
Chicken : 2/5 Skin was soggy and nasty where it should have been crunchy and amazing, bland chicken meat as if it wasn't seasoned properly, and the inside of the chicken was as tasteless as you could possibly make it.

The service here is very friendly and the beer selection is great. This is the reason I didn't go for 2/5 stars instead."}
{"text":"Sunday cravings for southern BBQ brought my boyfriend and I here for dinner last night. 

What we ate: 

- Smoked Baby Back Ribs Dinner (Stack size - full ribs) with Chipotle JD BBQ sauce ($30) - comes with smoky molasses beans, slaw and fresh cut fries/mash potatoes. Substitutions were granted; we replaced the fresh cut fries/mash potatoes with a garden salad instead. Ribs were absolutely delicious, the meat wasn't overly saucy and every piece had fall off the bone meat. We went with the server's recommendation of Chipotle BBQ sauce; sauce was smoky in flavor and incredibly mouthwatering. 

- Half Pound Texas Brisket Dinner with Carolina Sauce (mild spicy) ($18) - also comes with smoky molasses beans, slaw and fresh cut fries/mash potatoes. The proteins comprised of four generous slices of Brisket lightly drizzled in Carolina Sauce, another one of the server's recommendations. The Carolina sauce is mildly smoky with a little spicy kicker at the end. My boyfriend who doesn't usually do spice would agree with me and say the Carolina sauce is approximately a 2/5 on the spice meter. 


Summary:
Food (10/10) - Stack has their southern smoking on point. Protein and side portions were generous and food was brought out in a respectable time.

Service (9/10) - Would have liked our waters topped up more frequently, but otherwise our server was friendly and well versed with his sauce recommendations. 

Atmosphere (10/10) - Family friendly, big tables and booths, roomy restaurant, 2 levels of seating available, open kitchen for viewing pleasure.

ProTip:  Entertainment - Ask to speak to Tim, the Manager if you want to hear the story about the man who regularly orders the Ultimate Platter (feeds 3-5) with a side of fried Donuts for one... yes, I said for One. Also ask about his record breaking consumption of the Stack Challenge in under 13 minutes. 

Eat here."}
{"text":"Good selection of craft beers with rotating taps. Kids love the toy chest at the back where they can choose a toy with every meal. Ribs, brisket, smoked meat all good most of the time although they can miss the mark every once in a while."}
{"text":"In summary: Some mistakes in the order, unclear why they stuck us in the corner despite lots of empty tables, tons of fries do not make up for the stingy amount of meat on the platter and a nice waiter. Food was not bad but exactly at the two hour mark they essentially kicked us out despite being a large group with kids. The hostess said: \" I don't mean to rush you but there are people waiting for this table\". Funny she waited until after we paid and gave the tip. .. 
They also never replied to our comments through their website. 
Shame. It looked promising."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant! On a 6 day trip in Toronto, came twice! Staff is very friendly and does a great job upsaling the menu. We tried a variety of the dishes and every thing was delicious. The owner came around to ensure everything was acceptable, very impressive. Another note, I'm from North Carolina and know what is good bbq, this is folks. Don't miss out on a real gem."}
{"text":"Grabbed an early supper with my girlfriend here and was pleasantly surprised. While the menu seemed to be a little pricey, all burgers are priced a la carte, the food was delicious. When going to a smokehouse it is integral to get brisket, theirs is sweet, smokey and full of delicious flavour. I had it on top a half pound burger and was quite pleased. Ordered a side of fries and gravy, the gravy was really good but the serving size of fries for the price was not good. Maybe just a handful or two of fries for six dollars. The staff here was exceptionally friendly and served well. They have some really interesting desserts and milkshakes that I look forward to trying in the future. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Great food , ribs are amazing. Getting there donuts for desert is a must. The platter is good but you need a minimum of 3 people in on that."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this place has changed ownership. My wife and I used to love this place and go often. Food was always stellar. We went friday night and this was definitely NOT what we are used to. The brisket was very dry and the ribs are small and dry  when they used to be juicy and huge. Why do all the good restaurants in Toronto eventually take a dive???"}
{"text":"I found STACK on yelp and was eager to try their food.  I walked into the restaurant with my teenage son on a Wed night at about 8pm and it was fairly deserted.  We were in a hurry and were seated quickly.  We told them we needed to eat quickly.  The waiter barely acknowledged our presence.  Then, a party of four (2 couples) came in about 10 min after us.   The waiter gave them a few minutes and went right over to take their order!   Are you kidding???   We stared at him incredulous.  So, we got up and left.  On our way out, he approached us and asked if we'd like anything.  Too late, buddy.

This is 2017!   Really, a woman and teenager cannot get served???  What a bad waiter!

(this review was from a visit in the spring 2017)"}
{"text":"Went here during a weekday night, and there was a little bit of a wait. But, it was worth it."}
{"text":"This is a SMMMokehouse, so the wine list won't be extensive, but the meat list sure is! Briskets, pulled meat, roast meat, burgers, sandwiches, tacos and the BEST mini donuts!

Neat, large, baby friendly, good for groups and excellent service"}
{"text":"Stack has amazing BBQ meat! Don't waste your time with anything else when you are here. The food portion is also very reasonable so be ready to fill up! The service is also amazing. We came here on a Sunday night and 10 minutes before closing and they let us stay for a while and served us as usual!"}
{"text":"The food and service were great! I of course got the ribs because I'm a human being and not an insane person. This place was really busy so I'd recommend making a reservation if you're going for dinner. They serve Flying Monkey draught which made my heart happy but unfortunately the bathroom is downstairs which can be annoying once you've had a few and therefore have to use the little girl's room more frequently - and cardio is horrible, you know? But I mean - I had ribs so I should probably burn those off so you can still see mine."}
{"text":"I'll take the words from my fellow Yelper Peter M. \"I really wanted to like this place.\" That was my sentiment exactly. The place doesn't look much from the outside but inside, it's spacious, modern and clean. Washrooms also seems to have been renovated. It's actually a cool place to meet friends and hang out for a few drinks. 

The service was very good. Our waiter was attentive and our request always filled. They have a wide selection of beers and liquor including some craft beers. 

Unfortunately, the food we ordered wasn't on par with the decor and service. This place is not cheap but it's similar to the prices around this area. Also we did not order their BBQ meats. We had the Memphis Hot Chicken Sandwich and a Poutine with pulled pork. The buttermilk breaded chicken was really good but the combination of spices and sauce to make the spicy concoction made the sandwich taste off. The side was garlic mashed potatoes. The Poutine was just average. Nothing to make it stand out. 

I want to give this place another chance and get their Ultimate BBQ meats platter. Hopefully that will be better than what we ordered yesterday."}
{"text":"I went to Stack last night with a group of 4. The service was decent, the food was also decent. Thing is I've been to much better Smokehouses which is why I'm only giving this a 3 star rating.

We had:
Spinach salad - 4/5
The ultimate platter 3/5. Some of the meats were excellent some were just okay. It was a ton of food and a great value. 5 types of meat, cole slaw side, baked beans and loads of fries. I'll review each meat:
Ribs - 5/5 amazing 
Chicken -2/5 dry, not smokey enough. Needed sauce. 
Smoked meat - 4/5
Brisket -3/5 this wasn't marinated long enough and needed sauce. The strips were quite dry. The fatty part was good. 
Pulled pork -1/5 dry and flavourless. Not at all smokey.

The Cole slaw was delicious. For desert we had the donuts and they were warm and delicious. 5/5

If you come here I suggest you resist the platter and just get the ribs."}
{"text":"Came here one weekday for lunch. Ordered the ribs dinner. There was one piece that was charcoaled beyond repair and not edible but the other pieces were fall-off-the-bone, mouthwatering  deliciousness. The beans were a tad bit too sweet, but it looked like some pulled pork was mixed in so that was a pleasant surprise. The coleslaw was tangy and pickled. Just perfect! Service was attentative and lovely. Mmhmm delicious. I'd come back another time as I want to try their biscuit."}
{"text":"Came for Sunday dinner. We had reservations and it was quite busy. Service was excellent the whole night. From the outside it doesn't look like much but inside its actually quite large and spacious.  Lots of menu items and I would come back to try some other items. Definitely not the most amazing BBQ place but acceptable and worth a try. 

The Food:

Beef Brisket: 4.5/5 This was excellent, it was tender and juicy only problem is the price. Kinda expensive by the pound.

Smoked Wings: 2/5 Our wings were way over cooked and dry. The slaw was good thou.

Smoked baby back ribs (full rack): 2/5 Half the ribs were tender and juicy but the other half was so dry the sauce couldn't even save it. 

Smoreos shake: 5/5 This was super yummy, highly recommended. 

Smores Doghnuts: 5/5 What a great way to finish the night. Save room for desert."}
{"text":"Went with 2 friends on a weekday evening.
Waitress is nice and responds promptly.
Snacks are real good, I like the poutine.
Ribs and other combo are huge, good for hungry men. I suggest sharing some entree if you have ladies coming with u."}
{"text":"If you love stack you are on crack.

The ribs are dry and small. They must reheat them on a grill like your dad. Too bad your dad doesn't know how to make proper southern bbq. The chicken has a weird yellow sauce on it. Nothing tastes or looks like it has been cooked on a proper bbq pit. The beans, however have been let to sit in the smoke. So yes, they taste nice and acrid.

Here's the deal. This food had been Canadianized to appeal to the families in the area. Look around. You dont see any bbq officianados in here. Its white middle aged parents with kids. This is not a true bbq joint. It's upscale McDonalds. I just wish they had the McRib. That would at least be tasty.

Do your self a favor. Go to Cherry St. Bbq. And get familiar with a more authentic bbq.

The only reason I moved them up to 3 stars is because the poutine and cornbread was good. Thank goodness for that or I'd have to go buy another dinner."}
{"text":"You have to understand, I'm a filthy animal.

After working all-day and running on nothing but coffee and a grilled cheese sammy, I was extra-hungry. Now, despite being built like 12 year-old girl (I'm a 30-something male), I can eat a disgusting amount of food. (I found peace when I looked at the big eaters wall at Dangerous Dans. They're all skinny like me)

So, I actually had to use that opening line on the waitress to ensure that:

a) She averted her eyes at all times
b) She understood that I understood what I was getting into.
c) She wouldn't be completely horrified by me and my actions.

Stack makes no claims that they're a BBQ joint, but they do BBQ and it's clear from the menu that this is the case - lots of family-friendly items, plus a sizable \"Smokehouse\" section. I think they're actually very proud of their BBQ, but are avoiding the BBQ critics. Clever.

The draught selection won't drive you to visit, but it definitely separates itself from hundreds  of other restaurants by avoiding Canadian and Coors taps and opting for Beaus, Mill St and more.

I went pure BBQ with my order, starting with a brisket sandwich and a side of beans, though I was craving the sold-out pulled pork. The brisket was pretty solid: 

- it had a perfect amount of fat making it deliciously moist
- it wasn't boiled or steamed flavour free, so it actually tasted like beef
- it was actually smoked as promised

It seems like a simple checklist, but plenty of BBQ joints everywhere completely pooch brisket, it's horrifying, so I'd say it's important to mention.

Two thumbs-up for the beans as well. Low in salt, high in beany-goodness and padded with pulled pork. Hell yeah.

Now, despite the two pints of Beaus, I was still really hungry, so I ordered the 1/4 chicken dinner about halfway through my brisket. Impressed, I think, the waitress timed the order perfectly as I was taking my last bite of brisket when the chicken arrived.

It, too, was delicious. 
It, too, was smoked.

And the fries - salted and seasoned (with paprika, I think) giving it a hint of smoke as well. Nice work.

After polishing e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g off my plates, I was congratulated by our server who, by the way, was great, and had to wave off the offer of dessert. I mean, I'm a pig, but I'm not a cow. 

I'll be back for pork for sure."}
{"text":"This place looks and smells great. The food is absolutely delicious, flavourful and smoky! Also the plate sizes are quite large. I went to this location twice, and both times we ordered shareable plate for 4. It comes with ribs, chicken, brisket, pulled pork, fries, coleslaw and beans. This plate easily feeds 6 people, first time, 4 people couldn't finish half of it, and the second time even 6 people (although we did share two appetizers) left food on the plate. Now the first time we went, the food was great. No complaints, and a well deserving 5 stars. The second time we went, the food was below average and deserving of a 3 star. Averaged it out at 4 to be fair. The second time we went, the meat was warm (borderline cold.) Also the tortillas were VERY stale, was so bad, we didn't bothered eating them nor complain. The dip is great though. One more thing which i don't understand, why are the coleslaw and beans served in such small portions? There's a ton of food, but the beans and coleslaw; don't forget this is meant to be shareable for 4 people, come in little bowls, not even a spoon full. If you like these sides, get a few more orders on the side."}
{"text":"Stopped for a late lunch.  I had the brisket burger....really really good.  Will be back again"}
{"text":"One of the top BBQ restaurants I've been to. The place is very beautiful on the inside and has the perfect ambiance to have a date or group meet up.  We ordered the pit smoked wings as a starter and it was incredible, came out at the perfect colour and texture. For my entre I ordered the make your own meal option and got the ribs and sausage. Best decision I made that night, but be prepared because their portions are huge. Definitely coming back here again. The staff also very helpful. Price is also fair considering the quantity and quality of the food."}
{"text":"The burger had no flavour. I don't understand why there are so many positive reviews for this place's burgers - because they are really flavourless. The meat had zero flavour, would have thought it was McDonald's if I was doing a blind test. The burger was also unnecessarily soggy. I did not get expect a soggy burger.

I should have returned our order once I tasted the food, but I didn't have the time to go to another restaurant, so I sat through it ate and paid.

I really hope this isn't a common occurrence at this location. I was expecting to have a great experience for my meal.

Looking at the review below me, it seems this restaurant's quality is trending downward. Don't go."}
{"text":"Took my meat eating husband here for his birthday. We wanted to try a bit of everything so we ordered the platter. I'm pretty sure it was for 4 people but WHATEVER! It had a bit of everything - fries, mac and cheese, beans, corn, ribs, pulled pork, brisket and chicken. It was really really good, we barely got through it and took the rest home. Everything was full of flavour and delicious, not greasy or fatty, just good, and good quality. Very decent prices as well. We'd totally go back. Service was pretty good as well. Ambiance was ok but we're not the type to really care about that."}
{"text":"The dry ribs were off the chain and off the bone!  So good.  I'll pass on the parm fries only because I'm not a fan of parm cheese.  The fish tacos were normal.  Noah was our server and basically was a great server to the entire restaurant which was fairly busy!  Great spot."}
{"text":"Waited 40 min for our order since there were 2-3 families there, each of 6-7 persons, and apparently they had to be served first. All the plates went right by us and straight to them. Apparently couples don't matter that much.
My burger was very dry, bland, and overall tasted horrible. My girlfriend ordered a spinach salad and asked for some chicken in it too. When the bill came, spinach salad = $13 + $5 = $18. Eighteen dollars for a freaking salad!
To sum up: bad service, bad food, and expensive. Won't go ever again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Looked for a good smokehouse. Great place to watch teh game. I got the ribs and wings stacked platter. Prepare to get your hands dirty with the wonderful jack daniels bbq sauce tastes so yummy. the beans and coleslaw were pretty good too. Have great local brews. Great place to have a fun date or even watch the game with the boys."}
{"text":"Went to Stack with some coworkers and we all really enjoyed it. Quick run-down:

- amazing ribs
- family-friendly restaurant, $$
- good service, nothing over-the-top, but we felt like we were taken care of
- good sized portions
- not too saucy
- interesting beers on offer

I ordered the smoked baby back ribs (Stack size, so 2 racks of about 4-5 bones) which came with fries, slaw and beans. The slaw was delicious, just the right amount of dressing and the beans were this very slightly sweet smoky molasses. The ribs were incredible. Cooked to perfection, they fell right off the bone. And as I mentioned in my quick run-down, they also had just the right amount of sauce (notice a theme here?). I was so full from the ribs, slaw and beans that I barely touched my fries and I am a big eater. However, I prefer crispy fries and the fries were more soft than I would have liked.

Four of my coworkers (3 guys, 1 girl) got the Ultimate Platter to split and they were all full by the end of it. They pretty much cleaned the plate. They also said it was the right amount of food. They especially loved the brisket. I didn't get to try it (too focused on my ribs), but I trust their opinion.

We got 1 order of donuts to split between the 6 of us. They were freakin' delicious. So warm and fresh. I only wish I had saved some room to enjoy them more.

All in all it was a good experience. Was it the best smokehouse I've ever been to? No, but it was darn good and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place just opened up two days ago - and me and my wife (with son in tow) decided to check it out.  Frankly, I was very excited to have a \"Southern BBQ\" place just minutes away from my doorstep, as it's the thing I miss most from my travels to Tennessee.

Our meal was a bit rushed due to the little one, but here is what we ordered (it's a lot):
 * Grilled calamari appetizer
 * Lexington pulled pork sandwich
 * Rack of ribs (plus an extra half rack) - came with fries
 * Mashed potatos

Calamari appetizer:  First off, it seems like the server misheard our order and brought out fried calamari.  She was great though, and apologized (although either of us could have made the error) and even comp'd an extra half rack of ribs for free.  The calamari was quite good.  My wife liked it much more than my favourite calamari at Patheon on the danforth.  It was a completely different style than Patheon (which is grilled/charred and served quite plain).  It came with some salad-type fixings (diced olives, tomatoes, vinegar, and salad), which seemed to make the calamari softer and more like something you'd normally eat cold, although it was warm.  I liked it a lot, and my wife liked it more.  It's not my favourite way to do calamari but was a nice surprise.  If I was to have a complaint, the portion seems a bit small.  That's ok though, the rest of the food was big!

Lexington pulled pork:  This was quite different from what I was used to.  By itself it was good and had a bit of spice, although otherwise plain.  They had also brought us some vinegar dressing on the side.  Once we put this on, it made a world of difference.  It was one of the best pulled porks I've had outside of tennessee, and in many ways was better than the \"real thing\".  It was less saucy, which I liked.  I also topped it off with the cole slaw that came with the ribs - which really made it good.  Next time, I'll ask the owner why they don't have slaw as an option on the pulled pork.  I believe this is a Memphis thing.  

Quick note:  The slaw is vinegar based (not cream) and has a bit of a mustardy flavor to it.  I really liked it.

Ribs:  Sadly, I did not get to try these as we had to leave early because of the little one , but we brought some home and I'll give them a shot tomorrow.  My wife liked them, and my son absolutely devoured them.  There are few things in the world that make me happier than watching a 20 month old child eat ribs off the bone.  

Mashed potatos:  Also very good.  I'd recommend these as an alternative to the fries if you're thinking about getting a side.  The portion was healthy and the taste/flavor was more upscale than you'd normally get at a southern BBQ place.

Service:  The serving staff was great.  They were all very attentive, great to us, and great to our son.  They made good recommendations, and honestly seemed to care about the food and our experience.  A nice touch was that they gave my son a toy (they have a basket of toys to give to kids) - although I may regret this down the road if our son gets used to it.  I may just take the toy they gave him back with us next time :).  The owner also came by to see how we were doing.  He seemed very nice, humble, and grateful that we paid his restaurant a visit.

Ambience and layout:  This place is quite spacious!  It's laid out well and has two stories.  While the upper story is open, I don't think they'll be using it as they want to manage their capacity while the kitchen staff gets more efficient - or so I was told.  The place is interesting as to me it has a combination of: upscale restaurant, nicer franchise restaurant (it isn't.  Yet), and hotel lobby.   There are many large TVs (I didn't count, but probably 10-15 50\" TVs, which make me also likely to visit in the evenings after dinner when I'm going out for drinks with friends. I'm not doing a great job explaining it - I know.  But it all works out very well.  The kitchen is also somewhat open, and the Southern Pride BBQ oven they have to the side has glass windows so you can see it.  

Why didn't I give it a 4-star review?  Because I don't feel I got the whole experience, as we were rushed.  Also, the food took a bit of time to come out, which I'll chalk up to the calamari error, but probably moreso to the fact that the kitchen staff was busy, and has only had two days of experience operating.  I also tend to not give perfect reviews on my first visit.  

We'll definitely be back.  And next time we'll try more things on the menu.  The desserts/milkshakes sounded very appetizing.  So next time we'll save some space for them.

I'm very happy to have these guys in our neighbourhood and wish them the best of luck!"}
{"text":"My co worker recommended this place. So I decided take my friend for her birthday. We were a group of 10, the service is terrible!!!!!! Wow I can't express that enough, our waitress was rude and zero patience, many times she would rudely yell across the table asking if we were ready, when we told her we need a few moment, she would sigh loudly and walk away. The food is amazing but they need to hire better quality service. 

I had the fish taco which was amazing, my friend had the burger, wow delicious! The fries were also to die for.

I would give this place a 4 star if it wasn't for the horrible service we got."}
{"text":"4.5/5 stars for me. 

Stack was on my bookmarked list of places to eat! I ordered the regular Mac and cheese. It was absolutely delicious. A very healthy portion (half for lunch the next day). The top was a little bit dry, but j like it that way. 

I ordered the home style donuts for dessert. Nice and hot; so good.

Great service too."}
{"text":"The ribs were cooked to absolute perfection, and the pulled pork and brisket were so tender you hardly had to chew! (kinda like a duck swallowing a fish) As one of my friends said; \"the chicken is the least impressive part of the platter, but is still 10x better than any chicken I have ever cooked for myself\". The mac and cheese was definitely my favourite side (apparently they'll put pulled pork in it as a separate entr√©e, how nuts is that?) hell even the coleslaw was good, despite still technically being a vegetable!
I've seen the servers leaving the kitchen with some bomb lookin' tacos and burgers, however I haven't had the opportunity to try them. Judging by how well they cook literally everything else, I can only assume that the burgers and tacos hold up. So if you ever go visit Stack and don't order the Ultimate Platter for whatever reason (head trauma?) try 'em out and let us know.
Every time I've been to Stack, the owner of the restaurant has come out to our table to chat and see how the food is. I am a simple man, and I appreciate this in a business owner. It always feels good supporting businesses owned and operated by decent fellows!

{"text":"I decided to try this place based on other reviews. I found the food very average to poor. We had the BBQ ribs and beef brisket. The ribs were over cooked and dry. The beef brisket had very little flavor. They advertise their smoking but both the ribs and beef brisket had no smoke flavor to them. The only flavor was in the sauce. I will not be going back based on the high price for very mediocre BBQ."}
{"text":"Visited May 15 for dinner table for 2. They don't take resos during certain times, we left for 30 min and came back. Check out the PJ's pet store just North on Yonge. I rarely give 5 stars, so the resto should be happy that they impressed me :) My gf loves this place and has come before.

We sat on the 2nd level overlooking Yonge St. The server was a bit hard to get a hold of since we were at the front of the restaurant. Washrooms are all the way down in the basement so your legs will get a nice workout. The noise level was a bit noisy as the place was packed and they had TV's playing some sports. Plenty of pay-and-display street parking along Yonge St. 

Half-pound brisket - amazingly tender and melted in my mouth.
Lexington pulled pork - amazing with just a slight kick of spicyness. 
Cinnamon donut shake and S'mores donuts tasted like heaven!

SECRET TIP of the day: ask to see their 1200 pound smoker and they will show it to you! 

Damage $63 plus tip."}
{"text":"Perfect place for BBQ! The ribs were fall off the bone! The brisket and smoked meat were full of flavor! Overall I have to say this place is really really good. Perfect idea for a group. We ordered the ultimate platter and it was just enough for 5 people to get full on. The place was cozy and lots of families. We ordered the snores shake, smokes doughnuts, and ice cream. Did not expect the portions to be so big! Excellent for if you have a sweet tooth! The doughnuts are sooooo good!! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service: came as a group of 6, Haley was great attentive and friendly with some great suggestions. 

Food:

Environment: situated on Yonge not too far from Lawrence station and the 401 it's in a prime location.  The only challenge is finding parking.  As soon as you walk in you're hit with a perfume of BBQ and greeted by friendly staff. Inside is decorated pretty nice for a BBQ joint, casual setting. Clean and well kept. There's a second floor to the place but I didn't have a chance to go up. I imagine this place could get pretty busy so it's good to know there have a large capacity."}
{"text":"Loved this! We got the pulled pork, chicken, and ribs. Very delicious smoked bbq goodness at a convenient location. The only reason why I wouldn't jump to coming to this joint is because there's another bbq joint I've tried and its SOOO good and the price is cheap for the amount of food and sides you get. But no regrets on trying this place out."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.

A group of us came here for our friend's birthday this past weekend. I had heard about this place before so I was really excited to try, especially their ultimate platter. Luckily, two people in our group wanted to try as well so that's what we shared. The ultimate platter feeds 3-5 people btw. It consisted of their ribs, smoked meat, chicken, pulled pork and a lot of fries, with a side of mac and cheese, beans and coleslaw.

First off, let me just say it was friggin' delicious! I wouldn't say that their meat on the rib is fall off the bone kind of texture, but it was close. And smothered in their jack Daniel sauce made it so much better! The chicken however was a little dry for me but everything else was great. For 3 girls, we couldn't even finish the platter so we had to pack some home. 

As for service, it was amazing! Our server was really great and always checked up on us and refill our glasses. She was even accommodating when splitting the bills for us. 

Side note* if it's a birthday, their mini donuts are on the house! And they also taste like tiny Tom's!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple days ago with a friend to catch up and grab a bite. Stayed for about an hour.

Had a pulled pork sandwich (the BBQ version) and was very pleased. Got a large side of coleslaw (I'm picky with my slaw), but I can honestly say I have no complaints. We also split an order of fries, and my friend had another sandwich that I can't recall because I was really hungry.

Also had a smore milkshake, friend had a spiked smore milkshake. Both were awesome. Both used my favorite type of ice cream, which is Kawartha btw. It was an awesome drink. I finished it in about 5 minutes. Which is why I don't normally get them. Alas, no regrets... Kinda craving one now... damn...

Anyways, a great place to go for a bite in the area, and not too expensive."}
{"text":"We came on an afternoon and ordered the Ultimate BBQ Platter, shared between 3 people. The quarter chicken was too smoky/burnt for my liking, but the other meats (beef brisket, smoked meat, and ribs) were all great. The platter also came with buns, fries, beans, slaw, and mac and cheese. 

The waiter was very friendly and helpful, and the ambience is nice."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. The food is good, the milkshakes are good, and the donuts are also GOOD :). I have been here twice and would definitely not hesitate to go again. The staff are also very nice, helpful, and attentive, and the ambience here is quite nice!"}
{"text":"I had the wings ... delicious and unique ... and fries parmigiano ... unique again ... after all these years it's hard to get something u haven't served to u in the past 
.. check it out .."}
{"text":"Super yummy. Excellent service. Would come back again. 

Not the best BBQ I've even had in Toronto, but this was a great option for lunch with friends and my 9 month old daughter. One of these things you don't notice until you've had a child, but this place was very family friendly. High chairs available, water in plastic cups for the kids, a kids menu if needed with crayons and such, change tables in the bathrooms. 

And yet, it's still trendy enough to make me want to check it out. Food was really good, lots to choose from, and will have me coming back again. I got the Chipotle burger, and it was super tasty, with a juicy half pound burger and all sorts of toppings.  A little messy to eat, but tasty. Sides are separate to order, but are full portions. Husband ordered the Smoked Chicken, he really liked it. It was huge. 

For dessert, I was insistent on trying their signature donuts. You get 16 little fried doughnuts covered in the toppings of your choice. It was hard to choose between this and their milkshakes.

Yum. good choice."}
{"text":"I got the ultimate platter with the smoked wings and ribs. The SC bbq sauce my waitress brought me was to die for and the wings were A1!! Mac & cheese skillet was also very good"}
{"text":"Love my bbq.

Friendly service ...

Good portions, I was quite full not enough room for desert. Had the beef brisket...was tender and juicy. My daughter had the chicken...she found it a bit dry and wanted my brisket.

Will be going back with the rest of the family. Seems to be peanut allergy friendly..."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out because of all the rave it was receiving on Yelp. I was pretty disappointed. I made reservations, and my friend and I were given this booth right in the middle of the room. Not the best seating despite the fact that I had made a reservation. 

The food was disappointing. We ordered the calamari as a starter. It didn't have a very good texture and the taste was bland. The dip for the calamari was not very tasty. 

I ordered the Chipotle burger with a side of Mac and Cheese. The burger was average. Nothing special. I've had better. The Mac and Cheese was awful. It was dry and stiff and just not very flavourful. Again, I've had better 

We ordered the s'more donuts for dessert. They were way too sweet, and I LOVE sweets. We couldn't bother with finishing them. 

Overall, I would never go back here again nor would I recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Good food, ok service.

It was difficult to get the attention of the wait staff. We were literally waving down people to try to place our order.

For a table of three, we ordered a Stack (full rack) of ribs with a side of salad, 1/2 a pound of brisket, and the Parmesan fries. We finished with the original Stack donuts.


The ribs were good, the meat was tender and fell off the bone. There was a little too much sauce. Same goes for the brisket.

The Parmesan fries were also salty, and seemed to be tossed in some oil in addition to the cheese. They were very good though (definitely a cheat day meal). 

The donuts were served hot. We got a mix of the cinnamon and powdered sugar donuts. They have us two bowls full of ring donuts! They were definitely fresh, and the dough had a nice salty taste under the cinnamon/sugar.

We definitely ordered way too much and took home leftover ribs, brisket AND half the donuts. 

Good selection of beers on tap. 

The interior was ok, a bit worn down and definitely casual.

Good for a family night out or a casual evening with friends."}
{"text":"It surprises me Stack doesn't come top of mind, when you think of barbecue in Toronto. Perhaps not being in the downtown core can be a bit of a trek for some, but in my two visits here, I've been pleasantly satisfied with my meals.

We were a party of 3, and decided to split two BBQ dinners. We went with the Smoked Baby Back Ribs ($20) and the Half Pound of Texas Brisket ($18) which both came with fries, beans, and slaw. We decided to upgrade one of our fries to the Parmesan fries (for an extra charge), and substitute our other fries to extra slaw.

The ribs were meaty and smokey, and fall-off-the-bone, with just the right amount of sweet Memphis BBQ sauce, without being overly saucy. The brisket was moist and tender, and again, with just the right amount of sauce, allowing you to appreciate the smokiness and cook of the meat. As for the accompanying sides, the fries were tossed in aioli with melted parmesan and still maintained a nice crunch; the beans were sweet and smokey, in a thick sauce (as opposed to a pool of sauce); and the slaw was a bit vinegary for my liking. We were happy we split two dinners, three ways, because with the accompanying sides, it was very filling.

But we made sure to leave enough room for the doughnuts. Despite telling my two friends that one batch of doughnuts would be sufficient, we ended up placing two orders: Old Fashioned and S'Mores. Out came two full plates of made-to-order doughnuts, similar to those of Tiny Toms doughnuts. And for the record, we only managed to finish one plate.

Overall, a filling and substantial meal and a restaurant worth trekking out to for some delicious barbecue!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place doesn't have better ratings.

I loved it. I guess full disclosure, I tend to visit the places I review after a workout so I'm starving and I usually go solo and at off peak times, usually mid afternoon, so I never usually run into any issues with wait times or service issues.

This place was great, the BBQ was delicious, but I know nothing of proper BBQ, this tasted great to me, all this gibberish about fall of the bone or not, who cares. It tastes great.

The real star of this place is the crazy doughnut/smores monstrosity for dessert. SO EFFIN GOOD!

Go NOW, right now! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW"}
{"text":"Gets a thumbs up from me. The barbequed meats here are great. Even other dishes are good. Especially their \"Stacked Mac\" which is mac and cheese with their signature chipotle pulled pork. 

Very courteous staff but were a little slow and came by not enough times for water refills, probably understaffed since they are so popular."}
{"text":"Awesome food.
I felt like a raccoon the way I picked all the meat off of my chicken, it was that good.
I started with the spinach salad, it was divine.
My friends had the ribs and the burger. The ribs were super meaty and saucy..just the way I like 'em. The burger was huge and fresh. Actually way better than the Burger Cellar just down the street. Way better - done perfectly, slightly crumbly meat (not a solid, rock-hard patty), soft bun...
Service was really really friendly and attentive. Food came out really fast. Booths were comfortable. TVs were a bit distracting, but whatever!
I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch a couple days ago, modern ambiance, friendly and helpful staff, DELICIOUS Bang bang shrimp but average burgers and fries. criapy calamari was sort of plain."}
{"text":"This is going to be my first review ever! Yay! 

To describe STACK in a few words: Lively, Cozy, Meaty & Tender Ribs, Affordable, Fast Service

So, we came here for a meet up event (Toronto Eating Social..you may look it up if you wish) on a Monday night. All of us there either loves to eat, socialize or both, hence the name of the meet up group. We did make a reservation for 10-12 people, so we were seated right away. Right as I walk in, it came to my attention that this is a busy place. It was packed! Which made everything so exciting and in my head, 'man, there's a lot of people here that means it must be good here'. Once we got to our seats and settled in, a very nice, energetic & pleasant waitress immediately got our drink orders. Shortly after that, she came back with everyone's drinks for the night, and then took our main orders. Despite the fact that it was a busy night, our orders got on the table in front of us right away! Amazing! 

Now, I shall talk 'food talk'. I ordered the Smoked Baby Back Ribs in Memphis Sauce served with fresh cut fries, smoky molasses beans and slaw for whopping $20! How amazing is that? As I mentioned above, the ribs are so meaty and tender, not to mention moist. Ive had some ribs that were so dry, but STACK's ribs are definitely not. They are finger lickin' good, literally. You will be licking your fingers and make sure you wash your hands after! And, please do not be afraid to get a little messy. I super loved the Memphis sauce, the sweetness is on point. Not too too sweet with a very mild kick, just perfect. As per the sides, the smoky molasses beans were also good. Smoky & sweet enough to balance with the fries and coleslaw. I must say, one of the best tasting, good looking & finger licking good ribs Ive had! We were satisfied, that's for sure! 

Get messy & enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great burger
Great desert
Great choice of beers

The outdoor smear patio is right on Yonge, and a bit noisy. The tables inside are
More my style.

The gourmet bugger menu is wonderful, as I write this I wonder if it has changed since I was last there!"}
{"text":"Came to Stack on a snowy Tuesday night, hoping to bring back a taste of summer. It was fairly quiet, so we were seated immediately. There were multiple tvs hung on the walls which made it a very friendly hang out place but not particularly date friendly. 

We ordered the Build Your Own BBQ to share with 1/2 lb of pulled pork,  1/2 rack smoked baby back ribs along with the fries and potato salad as sides. It also came with cornbread and coleslaw. The ribs were definitely the favourite of the plate as it had the smokey bbq flavour and the meat fell off the bone. However, the other items on the plate were mediocre and the fries were served on the cold side which was a little disappointing. 

They hit a home run on the ribs but otherwise, we may try other bbq restaurants next time."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekend w/o reservations and it was fairly easy to get a table. For two people, we got the $28 special, additional order of fries and brisket.

The $28 special includes your choice of 2 meats and 2 sides with a cornbread. 

The ribs were absolutely amazing fall off the bone super juicy and tender. The pulled pork was meh. The brisket was yummy. The fries were my favourite though. They're a perfect texture and flavour. We got the Apple coleslaw(meh). Would probably recommend the Mac and cheese as a second side just cus it's more filling and you can't really mess up Mac and cheese.

The cornbread is amazing too. Afterwards we felt super stuffed but it was worth it. The service is good too!"}
{"text":"*vegetarian review 

I got the veggie burger with portobello mushroom, not bad!
I mainly came to socialize with my friends and even though I'm not a meat eater, I really enjoyed spending time here. I don't feel uncomfortable seeing others eat meat. 

The staff are amazing and if you feel uncomfortable about anything, don't hesitate to let them know. They'll make it right. 

It's so cozy and comfy here. Just like home!"}
{"text":"Had a brisket and the ribs so far both was really great 
The brisket melted in your mouth and the ribs just fall off the bone and they are super soft. 
Always wanted to try desert but I am always too full ;) 
The service is great and the restaurants looks super nice"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!
Ribs fell off the bone and was tender & juicy.
Ambiance was clean and the staff was very friendly.
Prices are a bit high but expected for what one pays for ribs."}
{"text":"One word

AMAZING!!!

I love my BBQ but this place has definitely won me over

Always get the brisket fries and they were super yummo
Brisket literally melts in your mouth

Had the Texas brisket sandwich and the best brisket burger 

Delish....but can be messy but this BBQ folks
Gotta get messy

Went with friends and they loved it as well

Also tried the donuts for dessert

Super delish

Would recommend this place for BBQ to anybody

BlogTO was not wrong bout this place!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here...i explained to the staff about my Celiac and they had no trouble accommodating me at all. The brisket was great, served on a gluten free bun that was toasted on a separate part of the grill....I didn't get to try all the sauces but I enjoyed whatever they gave me"}
{"text":"Came here with friends, made sure to make a reservation however it was really quiet that evening so a lot of empty spots. When calling in I really like their customer service over the phone. Our waitress was very pleasant and provided good service. We ordered the Giant Platter and two milkshakes to share. 

Let me just say the Giant platter was able to fill all 4 of us, at the end we were bursting. The food was delicious and the sauces that came with the platter were delicious as well. I really liked the mac n cheese, the brisket and the ribs. We ordered the s'mores milkshake and our friends ordered the Strawberry milkshake. They were very good and definitely filling. We ordered the s'mores donuts for dessert and ate them at home. 

Overall, I cannot wait to go back! A must try! But make sure you bring some people with you to share!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening and was so excited to try this place out.  We got seated upstairs which was nice.  The food was great except for the Mac and cheese which was a real disappointment as the Mac and cheese is what really drew us into trying the restaurant.  The Mac and cheese was so grainy and powdery in texture and it was just not good at all. 

The poutine, ribs, sausage, donuts and corn bread was delicious. I would come back again making sure to order only the above items BUT stay away from the Mac."}
{"text":"Yes, yes and yes again!

Been there multiple times, loved every minute, and will return as much as I can stomach (the portions are very hearty). 

In addition to the food accolades I'm singing, their child friendliness deserves a separate paragraph. There is a steady stream of patrons with children, and they all seem to be regulars (much like we've become). 

In addition to a great kids menu, everybody gets to choose a toy, after the meal. Even though its cheap dollar store stuff, it's the thought that counts."}
{"text":"If you are looking for ribs, look no further- STACK got you covered. I came here on Canada day and there wasn't a line up at all. Got our seats in ten minutes and everyone are super nice and friendly. Great services.

I ordered a Mac and cheese and ribs with mash potato on the side.It's really good-everything seems freshly made! Not to say they also have a huge bar area and tv so you can sit and enjoy the blue James game as well.

Definitely will revisit again :)."}
{"text":"Every time I have been to Stack: service - incredible, food - mouthwatering, ambiance - fantastic! 
A favourite time and time again."}
{"text":"Been here twice now, great restaurant. Their menu is full of delicious delights. Some of the best barbecue in the city of toronto."}
{"text":"Roasted chicken was juicy, but didn't need the mustard on top. I hate mustard though. The side potatoes were delicious. 

The mac and cheese was pretty much Kraft Dinner.

I wanted a beer and I'm 25 and always carry my ID. My boyfriend, 33 at the time, did not have his ID. I realize this is a legal thing, but as a former server, he definitely looks over 25...if he couldn't drnk, I didn't want to. The server wasn't so great at the age thing lol.

Servers are nice, but walked by us for about half hour when our glasses were empty and it was obvious we finishsd. It also wasn't really a full house.

Perhaps I'm somwhat to blame: apparently their ribs are one of the best in Toronto. If in the area again during a good time, I may try the ribs! Just a bit over rate for me, but I will try the ribs!"}
{"text":"This BBQ/Smokehouse has a delicious smoky aroma as you enter. The place has a comfortable, casual and pleasant atmosphere. The booths could be a bit more roomy and they don't take reservations between 6 and 9 on Fridays and Saturdays but the food more than makes up for these minor discomforts. Four of us had dinner starting with the Bang Bang Shrimp...a very tasty starter. I tried the Brisket dinner with the slightly spicy \"Texas\" sauce and it was loaded with smoky goodness. Another ordered the Brisket but with a sweet and less 
spicy \"Memphis\" sauce. Both orders came with delicious fries, slaw, and baked beans. Very generous portions too. The Fish Tacos were thoroughly enjoyed by another in our party. The 4th order was for Pulled Pork Tacos....also a hit. The service was professional and reasonably fast. The prices are reasonable. Definitely worth a return visit."}
{"text":"Stacked. And racked. That's how my plate looked. But not for long. 

On my way to a meeting, I had  quite a selection of restaurants from which to choose, but BBQ won out. Not just any BBQ, I am a 'cue snob so I would never settle for Swiss Chalet or even Montana's ribs. This better be good!

My server convinced me that I should have the larger serving of ribs (as if that took much convincing).  Sure, I can handle 8 bones, especially the smaller baby backs. 

Well, this was a mound 'o meat!  Beautifully smoked with the traditional molasses based sauce, accompanied by some snappy fresh slaw and a mound on fries that I just left behind. 

Not wanting to go to my meeting with BBQ sauce from ear to ear, I used a fork. Now I know where the term \"fork tender\" comes from. And where you should go to...."}
{"text":"Came here for my bday on a Saturday at 5:30pm and booked a reservation a week in advance. I had a large group of 15. I really liked that they didn't require us to do a set menu or even charged us the general 18-20% gratuity usually for large groups. That was nice and unexpected. Due note: they don't take reservations from 6-9pm. 

So I was looking over the menu and by 6pm, I was hangry and ready to order. A few of my party were running late but bday girl waits for no one, so off our orders went! Lol. A lot of my friends had the pulled pork and brisket burgers. A few had ribs and tacos too. I didn't get a chance to nibble on anyone else's dish so can't tell you the taste myself but I asked around and I believe they all liked it. General consensus was food is good and yummy. For myself, I had the brisket dinner w/ fries and beans ($18) and it was filling. Brisket was tender and tasty. Thumbs up! 

In was in the midst of my nomming, my late friends arrived (grrr) but they surprised me with a bouquet of flowers and a bday cake. So clearly - aww, all is forgiven. Lol. It was kinda funny cause I was very busy and apparently oblivious during dinner. My friend pulled a little ninja move before they came in to the restaurant and likely gave the staff my cake at the door. It was after the dinner finished that our server Andrew came out with the fried doughnuts and my cake with a sparkler. He jokingly said it won't stop for a while so my friends might have to sing Happy Birthday at least 2-3 times. They embarrassingly obliged. Haha.

Overall, the restaurant is pretty busy but I didn't feel rushed at all and our server was very nice and friendly. I had a nice time and would recommend this place."}
{"text":"These guys were on a top 10 list for Toronto BBQ's and they need to be moved to a top 3 list!!!

We did the platter to try everything and it was all super. Excellent ribs, chicken, brisket everything the fries were sooo good loved the it all.  We will be back. 

I was told that the Caesar was the best ever. 

Keep it up guys we'll be back."}
{"text":"I found this place busy on an early evening. BBQ ribs were good but not great and a four-rib half-rack and a beer came to $35 all in--which seemed too high for what I received--ribs, beans, cole slaw.  OK, I guess, but nothing more."}
{"text":"Been here twice and the second time I think was better than the first.
I'd come here for the beer and it's good that their food is decent too.

First off, the bartender was super cool and a beer nerd. He was telling us about choosing the taps, all they have is Ontario craft beer. good stuff! And then they have a rotating tap that changes as the kegs are finished. I think that's really cool so that you can try something new every time.

Then the food, an extensive menu that looks really good on paper. They got sandwiches, burgers, paninis and a bunch of other things. But I'd say their trying to focus on the meats. I've tried both their brisket and their smoked meat. Both are aged and smoked in house. I'd say I'd choose their brisket over the smoke meat Though the smoked meat is tasty, it's not to the caliber of Montreal Smoke meat. Still good though.
Their brisket though I think is slightly softer and that's what I like.

What is nice is the condiments, three different types of mustard. I would like to see some nice mustard seed mustard though.

I'd come for the beer and stay for the food."}
{"text":"As some others have said, I wanted to love this place. The staff was very friendly and attentive, they had good beer on tap and the atmosphere was pleasant. Unfortunately the actual food wasn't that great. I ordered their babyback ribs, and I think that they got their \"falling off the bone\" texture by being overcooked. They tasted dry,not smoky and not very flavorful.

I would happily come back here for a drink, as a bar it's a five star establishment. The bartender was great, when you're in the middle of a weeklong work trip and starting to feel a bit lonely it's nice to make small talk with someone cheerful in the evening. I'd go somewhere else for dinner though, or at least get something other than barbecue. Maybe their burgers are a better bet?"}
{"text":"The bbq rib was one of the best I had in the city.  However I went there with my wife and my 9 months old.  The service from our waitress was horrible.  She kept on giving us a straight face as if she didn't like serving us. Overall a very disappointing experience ... All because of this weird waitress."}
{"text":"Came again because the fish street diner closed early and we were starving, so we decided to come back because we enjoyed the first time we came. 

My husband ordered the Oreo milkshake ($6). Good but not thick enough. Then we ordered the ultimate platter ($64).   Once it came it took almost half the table, it was massive! Definitely a meal to share for 4 people at least. I can see why it was $64. 

It was meat overload (full rack of ribs, quarter chicken, 3 different type of smoked meats) with a massive overkill pile of fries, Mac & cheese,  3 buns, a small side of beans and slaw.  If you LOVE meat and you don't think you will get sick of having so much of it this is the meal for you. 

At the end it didn't look like we touched the platter lwe were so full so quickly. We took the rest home and we both had meat comas. 

Our server this time wasn't amazing but wasn't awful.  Food came out at a decent time considering it was a packed house, prime time for dinner on a Saturday evening and the fact we ordered a platter with so many different types of meats and items. 

I would go back to try other items on the menu like their fish tacos or if I'm craving a lot of meat again. Not my favourite place but someplace I would recommend."}
{"text":"We finally got a chance to try StAck last night and boy I am glad we did.  They have a great list of cocktails and classic local taps for beer.  

To start we went with the calamari and the wings.  The calamari was good but nothing beyond expectations but the wings! Hold the front door.  They had a beautiful smoky flavour and the best bark I have ever experienced on a non fried wing.  It was like eating magic.   Would definitely recommend the wings.  

Moving onto the main and three of us shared the latter.   Welcome to BBQ heaven.  Delicious ribs, smoky brisket, pork, Montreal smoked meat and a half a chicken for good measure.  The fries and Mac n cheese were unreal and everything was on point.  We demolished the platter but were defiantly full.  Can't wait to go back and try some other things.  The burgers looked amazing.  The staff was very friendly and management was great.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has won my heart over multiple times. As an avid carnivore, I enjoy everything on the menu. What's music to my ears is the menu is prepared fresh (even the spices), and in house. The beverages are also plenty in variety for everyone from chai tea, to hand-selected craft brews, jones soda, and creative shakes made by Chris.

STACK has great atmosphere, and customer service.

Notable mentions:

Ribs, Spicy Beef Taco, Smoked Chicken Wings, Mac n Cheese

Ask for Chris, he will take care of you.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Stack was delicious!! They have very many options for any type of diet, including a vegetarian section. The shared BBQ plate that serves 3-5 is probably a great option for a group. The milkshake options are plentiful- the surprise ones are especially fun. 
The service was very good. Our waitress had great menu knowledge but towards the end of the meal was a bit less attentive. 
There is a BBQ rotisserie/pit towards the back. I watched the staff load and sauce ribs which was fun!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Nice interior and setting.

THREE CHEESE MAC + DOUBLE SMOKED BACON
2.5/5 Pretty good - but I'd prefer it if the mac & cheese had more sauce. It was kind of dry - the bacon was really good though.

HALF POUND TEXAS BRISKET DINNER
3.5/5 I liked the brisket! 
We substituted the fries for sweet potato fries - The dipping sauces are EXTRAS. Our waitress failed to tell us that, she basically listed all the sauces like it was part of the meal.. not impressed.

S'MORES STACK DOUGHNUTS
4/5 The best dish out of everything that we've ordered.
Very yummy. Reminds me of the funnel cakes from Canada's Wonderland. 

Service was okay."}
{"text":"Stack did not stack up to the other reviews. Very average. 
The brisket dinner was more like a plate of French fries with a side of brisket. It's not that anything was bad. In fact the baked beans were amazing and so was the coleslaw. However this is a BBQ joint and the brisket was average."}
{"text":"I came to Stack just after noon on a Saturday for a pint and some bar food.  I chose this restaurant based on the positive reviews on Yelp and how convenient the location is.  The interior of the place looks like a sports bar, including seating booths decked out with televisions.  Although it's definitely a more high-end and sleek looking d√©cor than your typical sports bar.  Their patio faces Yonge St, and has about 4 or 5 tables for small groups.  We decided to eat outside because it was a beautiful summer day.  

The service was great, and our server was very attentive in making sure we were satisfied without being too overbearing.  I wanted to try the wings but unfortunately, they were out, which made me want to try them even more.  I found it surprising that a place serving pub food would be out of wings on a Saturday afternoon.  I ended up ordering their Stack Burger and the Memphis Dry Ribs, along with a pitcher of Muskoka beer.  To be completely honest, I didn't find their burger to be particularly tasty or flavourful.  The beef patty had an odd, sweet taste to it that threw me off initially.  My partner didn't find the burger to be enjoyable either.  The Memphis Dry Ribs were quite tasty however, and I thought that their dry rub was quite pleasant.  In conclusion, I found the prices of Stack's food to be slightly overpriced for the quality and I didn't find it to be particularly special.  However, I think I will be back at some point in the future to give them another try."}
{"text":"A burger and BBQ spot on Yonge north of Lawrence? Don't mind if I do!

Burgers were way above average....quite delightful, in fact. (Did I just describe a burger as \"delightful\"? I did!) Among the mouth-watering burger selections, we chose the old standby bacon/cheeseburger and were impressed with the quality. We ordered our bacon \"extra crispy\" and damnit, that is exactly what we got. Bonus points.

The \"Brisket Stack\"--buttery-soft slices of saucy brisket, topped with crispy lil onion rings and spicy ranch sauce, sandwiched in sesame buns--was delightful (there I go again!)

Ribs were great too. Even the simple garden salad was crunchy and fresh (sweet Thai dressing recommended).

Given the items described above, sadly we had no room left for the famous mini donuts. Sure, we smelled their seductive aromas...but we were too busy busting at the gut. So I'll be back here soon, preferably in a semi-drunken state, to inhale some of those donuts with reckless abandon. It will be delightful!"}
{"text":"Ultimate platter is so worth it! Brisket is on point! Mac and cheese with bacon is awesome too. 

Don't forget to try doughnuts for dessert."}
{"text":"Great ribs and bbq.  Try the bbq beans too.  Just like Tennessee.  Friendly service.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Had the Mac and cheese. Highly suggest. Unbelievable. The burger patty was alright. Brisket was good. Service is tremendous"}
{"text":"We had a good server (Chris) so we were surprised with the  comments about the negative service in yelp. We had the parmessan fries, ribs dinner and Texas brisket sandwich. But what were truly amazing were the smores milkshake and strawberry doughnuts!"}
{"text":"I ordered a brisket sandwich which was good not amazing and had way too many fried onions on top but the parmasean truffle fries were amazing , my friends all loved their food too. One of them got salmon which I tried and was amazing and the other got the spicy chicken burger with poutine which was also great."}
{"text":"They are vegetarian friendly, but they don't use the word \"vegan\" anywhere on the menu.  There are two vegetarians items that look to be easily modified to be vegan -- a portobello burger and a black bean burger.  By \"vegan\", I mean the kind where you are starving and willing to go with \"don't ask, don't tell\" on the ingredients.   We asked them to remove the dairy based spreads and cheeses that were listed in the description and pretended that there were no hidden non-vegan ingredients in the patty or bun.  The beer was good and service excellent.

Update from 2016:  I've gradually grown more strict in my vegan eating and decided to stick with the beer on our most recent visit.  Yes, I know there is a good chance the beer wasn't vegan either, but I'm not that strict yet..."}
{"text":"Stack is one of those restaurants that is usually quite busy all the time, and also a neighbourhood favourite. Kids, teens, adults and people of all kinds go here for good food. My favourites personally are the Stack Mac, Parmesan fries, and can I like have a moment to gawk and go slightly crazy over those awesome doughnuts??? YAAAAAASS :D (sorry I had to, they are absolutely delightful)

It's good space-wise, with a second floor, and it's nice during the summer. Service is good here too, with friendly staff. The only downside I'll mention is that parking can be a pain, especially if you can't get a spot right away."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Stacked dozens on times and seem to constantly have a craving for it. There food is always amazing, hot, fresh, the way you order it, large portions and extremely flavourful. The owner, the chefs and even the servers really know what they are doing. My favorite is the Chicken  Bacon Cheddar Sandwhich with a side of Poutine. 
There are'nt many restaurants in Toronto that will serve a decent poutine, This is one of them that knows what they are doing! 
Highly recommend. As a picky eater, Stacked has never failed me."}
{"text":"STACK is just AMAZING for BBQ! The yelp reviews are all correct. This place is the bomb for beef brisket. It was so soft and tender. Melt in your mouth. The poutine was just heaven in a big white bowl. It had the curds, the right gravy and the smoked meat on top was just divine.
Service was quick and efficient. Prices are pretty good if you over order like I did. HAHA. Totally recommend this place for a nice upscale atmosphere with a large metal smoker on site. DELICIOUS! 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"Those ribs, man. Incredible. 

I went there with my family (there were five of us) and we ordered the platter. It came with pulled pork, roasted chicken, smoked meat and ribs, surrounded by fries and some rolls. Everything in the platter was fantastic, but the winner would be the ribs. Hands down.  

The best part about the platter though, was taking those fries and scraping the bottom of the tray full of BBQ sauce and leftover bits of the meat. 

We also started with the wings. If you're a fan of dry rub ribs, you're not going to find anything better."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for food and 1 star for service. Their smoked brisket really is melt-in-your mouth smooth and pulled tenderly with love. Tossed in a generous pour of Carolina Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, it's tangy, just slightly sweet and smoky. Their buns are also very soft and fluffy - a nice contrast.

The only flaw was that there was a bit too much sauce (and I love lots of sauce), and the crispy onions straws that were on top had become completely soggy by the time my food arrived. Maybe it was the amount of sauce or it sat at the pass too long. The brisket far made up for any losses. Without a side, it wasn't a lot of food. I'd love the brisket just on a plate, but the brisket meal is $18 and sounds like ridiculous amount of food. My friend had the chicken tacos, and I found them surprisingly bland, even though it says on the menu that they are \"spicy.\" Unlike the brisket this needed more sauce, more seasoning and a more flavourful pico de gallo (missing cilantro and jalapenos).

Now for the service: My friend arrived at 9:15pm on a Saturday and barely got the last table for two. I  came in at 9:30pm after a long bike ride. My friend hadn't even been offered water and it was 9;45 before we even SAW a waitress, who came practically running by us to a table that had come in later, completely ignoring us. I finally said something to me friend and the waitress turned and gave me a dirty look and said \"what?\" so then I told her, \"it was nothing, just that we have been waiting for half an hour.\" She then did come over and take our order, and she apologized but passed the blame onto her boss, saying he'd told her to go to the other table. Who knows? The place is long and crowded. It took the food another 30 minutes to show up (which is long when everything is pre-cooked). So, service could definitely use improvement.

Also, the drinks were very pricey, with the cheapest pints at $8 plus tax, and bad wines starting at $10. I also think it would be nice if they made a smaller platter for smaller groups. Maybe just have the three basics: Brisket, pulled pork and smoked meat, with just some small buns or bread and mustard on the side. Also, I think cornbread is a necessary addition to the menu, as they are big on their smoky ribs and they go hand-in-hand (or mouth in mouth... mmm).

I think my next visit might just be for dessert since the menus boasts fresh, mini, sugar and cinnamon donuts and mouth-watering milkshakes - none of which I had the chance to try."}
{"text":"On the positive side, the restaurant looks great and the seating is very comfortable. The staff were also great. However I can only offer 2 stars as I was very disappointed in the smoked meat sandwich. The flavour was fine but the meat was rubbery and the sandwich was small, Now smoked meat sandwiches are usually small, as they are served on rye bread, however they should be pilled high (especially for $12!). This was not the case. 
And $3.50 for a coke in a place like this is a bit high.
That said I will try Stack again as I did see some great dishes being served, but their smoked meat sandwich needs a lot of help."}
{"text":"Came here for my boyfriends birthday with a bunch of people. For groups they don't tack on gratuity automatically and work with you to get you the best table possible. Food was good there are a few criticisms however. Ribs, brisket, fries were great. And don't even talk about those amazing ass milkshakes just get one of them!! Chicken was dry as well as the mac and cheese is pretty basic tasting. Not bad but just not out of this world."}
{"text":"There were so many different things I wanted to try on this menu and if I had more room in my stomach I'm sure I would have ordered more.

Sweet potato fries $7 - wish there were a bit more crispy and sauce was lacking a bit if flavor (3 stars)

Fish taco's $11 - fish portions were small and were served in 3 mini sized soft shell taco's. Wish there was more guacamole and the taco's overall was lacking in flavor (3 stars)

Stack brisket $10 - smoked beef brisket with thin deep fried onions. Wish there was a larger portion in beef slices and onion but overall pretty good taste (3 stars)

S'mores milk shake $7 - perfection. Not overly sweet and the marshmallows had a nice texture like they were roasted over a camp fire (5 stars)

Old fashioned donuts $6 - freshly deep fried donuts with cinnamon sugar. Simple but good and a decent portion to share between 2-3 people (4 stars)

Service was excellent and super friendly like I was talking with a friend instead of a waiter (5 star service)

I'm sure I will be back soon to try the ribs and pulled pork. It was so hard not to order those for my first visit but there was just too much I wanted to try. I was not overly impressed by the actual food but the desserts made up for it. For now I will have to give this place a 3.5 stars. I hope my 2nd visit for their BBQ good will be more impressive."}
{"text":"Stack was okay. I might come back if I was in the area, but definitely won't make a trip just for the restaurant.

The food was good. I shared the ultimate platter with a few friends, and it's presentation was amazing. I liked the brisket the best; it was tender and the flavours came out so perfectly. While there wasn't a lot of meat, there were plenty of fries underneath the top layer of food. So, because it was a shared platter, there wasn't a lot of meat to go around. 

The entire table ordered milkshakes, and to be honest, they weren't as great as the other reviews claimed they were. The flavours were flat... My brain only registered the drink to be too sweet, and had no idea what it was supposed to taste like. My friend had the doughnut milkshake, and they put ground doughnut pieces into the drink... It was a bit unappetizing. 

Our server was nice but distracted. To be fair, it was a Saturday night. But, my main reason for the low rating was the seating and noise level. In the middle of our meal, a group of 15-20 men were seated behind us. I couldn't hear my voice. It was so disastrously loud. That entirely ruined the mood, and my group left before we finished our food."}
{"text":"It's really difficult to find a good barbeque restaurant that is not in the downtown core. Sure traffic on Yonge isn't that much better, but still something I'd gladly pick over the nightmare that is the finance district.

Getting reservations at this restaurant was very difficult when it first opened. The first few times, when arriving after 8, they would be sold out of the brisket and pulled pork. The owner came by to apologize about the meat inventory and overall I was very happy with the service. They have now done a lot better at managing their food supply and so far they have not run out anything even coming in as late as 9 with a group of friends.

For people who have never been to this restaurant, I would recommend the platter. It is a massive tray of food that can feed about 4 people depending if you like fries. What's great about it is that you can get to try pretty much all the signature meats without breaking your wallets. 

The platter comes with following:
Lots of fries - can choose from garlic parm, regular fries, or sweet potato
Half a chicken
Full rack of ribs
Pulled pork
Slices of Brisket
Smoked Meat

They have a selection of sauces with JD BBQ being the most popular. I would go with what the server recommends and I'm sure the owner wouldn't mind dropping in to give his take on it (he knows his bbq).

Aside from the meat, the sweet potato fries are fried perfectly. It is never oily and for you sweet potato lovers, the platter comes with about 4 serving of fries. Their shakes are ridiculously good, more on the thick side made with ice cream rather than just milk. I would recommend sharing one as one these full sized shakes can easily knock you out.

The burgers taste great, but aren't mind blowing in anyway. If you like burgers, you won't be disappointed(or left hungry), but you won't be amazed either. It is also important to note that the burgers don't come with sides.

Overall great experience, comfy seats, very social accommodating staff and most importantly great BBQ that is not downtown."}
{"text":"Let aside the fact that they don't have onion rings (a burger place!) the nachos burger that I ordered was half raw and tasted funny. The coleslaw also tasted awkward and the fries were mediocre. The was a quite copacetic California wine that saved the day."}
{"text":"Food taste amazing and service is great. I've been here a few times and the main reason we are hooked is because of their delicious ribs! The place has plenty of room for seats considering there are two levels. It does get really busy especially when there is a game on so do plan ahead. We usually park on the neighborhood side street around the corner which is just a minute walk (depending how lucky you get to find a spot). Within the few times we came here we have tried their Ultimate Platter, Fish Tacos, Bang Bang Shrimp, Smoked Baby Back Ribs with Sweet Potato Fries, Three Cheese Mac, Brisket Dinner, and a vanilla milkshake. Everything listed tasted great. The tenderness of the ribs and the sauce is stunning. Unfortunately I don't have every food item pictured (obviously my hunger got to me). Staff is also really friendly. Although wait time to be seated can be long, it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great smokehouse in the center of the city. I had brisket  and my friends had ribs Both were very good. They slow cook everything on site. A fun place to have a relaxed meal and watch the game."}
{"text":"Really great spot. Bright, airy, clean and comfortable. Nice area for a walk and window shopping after.

Food was delicious and quick. So many delicious offerings it was hard to decide. We had Montreal smoked meat poutine, catfish tacos and some brisket platter.

Great service

Kid friendly, including a treasure box for kids to chose from. 

Helpful with allergies.

We will return again."}
{"text":"Great food and good service, the pit smoked wings were awesome!! Ribs were flavourful and not too fatty. I would eat here again anytime!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly about their milkshake!

This was my first trip to Toronto and you better believe I had to go on my trusty Yelp to map out what I wanted to eat and where! I came across Stack one day but alas, I was way too full to even order anything but a milkshake (which is fine because that was exactly what caught my eye anyway). 

I ended up getting the cinnamon donut milkshake while my boyfriend got the cookies and cream. We were not disappointed!! I slurped up my milkshake quicker than you can even say the word (lol)

It was that good!

When I do come back to Toronto, hopefully I'll be able to try some of their other items."}
{"text":"They give you sooooo much food! The food was great and the meats was moist and flavorful. We all tried something different and everyone left stuffed and happy"}
{"text":"VERY yummy.  Brisket was superb and so were the fries and slaw.  Service with a smile and great beer selection. Will return."}
{"text":"Need to give this place another shot. 
I tried the Stack Brisket sandwich with the Chipotle Jacks sauce.
Brisket was cooked well and was tender.  I'll have to come back to try more, but it would have been nice if they had a half version of the Ultimate platter

Craft beer = Thumbs up.

Shout out to our server who was able to change one of the TVs to the conference finals ball game that was on. No love for the owner/manager who said he would do it, but acted too busy - walking around with the rag to wipe down tables with, but not even wiping a single table... or walking past our table trying not to make eye contact. You get the thumbs down.

Other than that, Stack is a decent BBQ joint :)"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most interesting Bbq spot in Toronto, I always look forward to a dinner at Stack. And so there we went, my wife and I last Saturday.

Oh, the humanity.

Ordered drinks at the bar while we waited. About 40 minutes in all, which was weird given all the empty set tables we could see. We were finally shown a table on the second floor, in the middle of a crowded area, but asked instead if we could sit at another table that was less cramped and, yes, was all set and empty... M wife ordered the Pulled Pork sandwich, I opted for the Texas Brisket. 

More waiting. And waiting. Finally someone who was not our server brought our plates. I asked for another beer, which seem to annoy him considerably. That was strange, as they are normally eager to replenish them.

Took a bite and realized it was barely warm. Now normally when I return my meal to the kitchen I never, ever accept a replacement meal (anyone who like me has ever worked in a kitchen knows why one would stick to that policy, just in case). Made an exception for the first time in years, and that was an error.

More waiting. Our server finally returned with what looked like the same plate, as evidenced by the brisket still showing the bite I had taken earlier. Looked like they had shoved my meal in the nuke for a few seconds, and then left it on the shelve waiting for someone to bring it to our table. Not only was the brisket still tepid, but now the fries were overly crisped and oozing oil.

Enquired about my beer. \"Oh, did you want another beer?\" Then server asked me if the food was better. She simply turned around and left when told it was not.

Resolved myself to drink the water instead, since there was  no beer coming. Water was warm, almost hot! Beer actually never came. Server showed up just as I was finishing the brisket, to inform me that the keg was empty. \"Would you like something else?\" \"Yes, the check, please.\"

Server seemed really excited to inform me that a 25% rebate had been applied to my meal. Wow! Too bad she also tried to charge me for that elusive beer.

Bad service, empty tables while they make you wait, no ice in the water, phantom drinks on your check, and no comp for bad food. Staff cuts, maybe?

What a shame. I really used to love Stack."}
{"text":"Wow... Really amazing place to be at. LOVE the food, and the place is really nice, Everybody were really nice.. the price is just right.. and the donuts is DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 12. Most of us ordered chicken or ribs and general consensus is that the food was really good. I personally got the Stack sized BBQ ribs with their standard jack daniel's sauce. Stack size just means full rack. It's been awhile (years) since I've had juice, meaty, fall off the bone ribs. Let's just say I finished my entire rack and wanted more. Very pleased. My side order was garlic mashed potatoes and that was also delicious. My friends ordered the key lime pie milkshake and strawberry milkshake. Both were heavenly good. They have gluten free options as well. 

For such a large group, our orders came reasonably on time. Our server was amazing & personable. She made us laugh a bunch of times. 

It was only yesterday but I'm craving the ribs this morning."}
{"text":"Came in a group of 7 on Saturday night and we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Surprised that itnis actually spacious inside.

We ordered the Ultimate Platter which is now $84.99 to share plus a side of parmesan fries. I love the brisket but find they use the same bbq sauce on everything. It would be nice if they have all diff bbq sauce to choose from on the side. I love the fresh cut fries, it was cooked crispy. I highly recommend the parmesan fries, its a must!

We also tried the s'mores doughnut dessert and I really liked it. Doughnut were served hot n a little crispy, with chocolate syrup whipped cream and marshmallows.

Server is nice and attentive. Overall experience was really good"}
{"text":"Went to Stack after an ultimate game with the team just to try the Ultimate Platter (pulled pork, Montreal smoked meat, beef brisket, ribs, fries, Mac & cheese, coleslaw, baked beans and buns).  We ordered one platter for 8 of us (3 guys, 5 girls) and another order of chicken and ribs.  The bbq sauce was very tasty and all of the meat was tender (with the exception of the chicken).  All of us loved their fries!  We ate all of them, including the crumbs! There also was not enough Mac & cheese for my liking, but that's because I love Mac & cheese! Needless to say, it was a lot of food!  We did have enough space left in our stomachs to order their S'mores mini donuts which were also so delicious!  I would definitely go back to try the other stuff on their menu!"}
{"text":"My long overdue review is here. Came to Stack about a month ago to try their BBQ and celebrate a friend's birthday.

Service was awesome, the food was delicious and we got free donuts (reminds me of Tiny Toms) for the birthday girl. 

The platter which serves 3-5 people is a variety of all their good stuff. I liked the brisket and pulled pork the best. It came with a mountain of French fries too. I think this could definitely serve 5 people, it was too much for 3 girls that's for sure. We had lots of leftovers. 

I really enjoyed my experience here. Stack is north of me so it's quite a trek to get here from downtown!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night and was disappointed to find that the reservation I made the evening prior did not show up; I was told that the wait would be 20-25 minutes for a table.. no problem. The wait ended up to be around 45 minutes.

When we finally got seated.. we ordered the Smores and Shaketender Surprise shakes (both very delicious, but slightly pricey for $7!).

For food we ordered the half pound jalepeno cheddar sausage, ultimate platter (indicates feeds 3-5) and a stack of ribs.. for 6 people. The wait for the food took some time (I guess that explained the long wait time, or I was just hungry).

The jalepeno sausage has a kick to it, very delicious, served with grainy mustard.

The Ultimate Platter was the best value, it comes with a sample of all the meats (beef brisket, smoked meat, pulled pork, chicken and ribs).. we upgraded to sweet potato fries for an extra $5.. so worth it..a huge mountain of it! The ribs were my favourite meat and the mac & cheese that comes with it was amazing..so creamy and cheesey.. wish there was a bigger portion! I asked for some chipotle ranch sauce for the sweet potato fries and was surprised to see at the end of my meal that I was charged an extra $1 for it.. no big deal, just wished I was given a heads up.

We ended up taking home half the rack of ribs along with some meat scraps here and there from the platter..we could probably have done without the extra stack of ribs.

The old-fashioned donuts were served fresh and warm... mmm!

At the end of our meal, the owner came to apologize for the reservation mixup; overall, the staff are very friendly..will be back!"}
{"text":"The ribs and brisket are DELICIOUS! Definitely get the chipotle JD bbq sauce.
A little pricey but very tasty"}
{"text":"I went here a few days ago with a friend of mine and got The Big Stack burger ($17) and a S'mores milkshake ($7).

The burger patties were pretty good tasting and the burger in its entirety was extremely filling. The downside is the difficulty of fitting the burger in your mouth to take a bite out of it, and the relatively thin bun quickly becomes soggy- you will definitely be making good use of your napkin! My friend got the Avocado Bacon Burger ($13) and was satisfied with the amount of food.

The milkshake was amazing. I highly recommend getting one.

The service was lightning fast. The server apologized for taking a short amount of time to get to us and was very attentive and helpful. No complaints in this area!

Great experience overall."}
{"text":"Was really hesitant to come here due to the mixed reviews but decided to give it a shot and hope for the best. It was my mom's birthday so we wanted to surprise her with a bbq platter that I've been eye-ing from these other photos. Off the bat, I knew I wanted to order us the Ultimate Platter; $90 for a full rack of ribs, chicken wings, brisket, pulled pork, cornbread, coleslaw, beans and fries. The brisket, ribs and fries were probably my favourite. The bbq sauce on the pulled pork is definitely tangy-er and has more of a spice to it while the sauce on the brisket is on the sweeter side (my type of bbq sauce). Amongst 4 people, we were able to kill it so I guess it depends on your appetite. The service was also on point and the ambiance of the restaurant had a cozy feel to it - not too fancy, more casual vibes. I mentioned it was my mom's birthday and they were sweet enough to surprise her with a generous plate of tiny doughnuts and a sparkler FOR FREE! Definitely going to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The waitress knew all the right recommendations to make and I'm glad we listened."}
{"text":"Great selection of foods. Mac and cheese the noodles were cooked just right and the sauce was creamy and delicious. 

Service was great and made sure that our table always had what we need. The bench seats in the booth is movable and it was quite annoying having to deal with it shifting around. The kitchen is open to view as is the charcoal pit, but because of the long elongated shape of the restaurant, few people have a chance to see it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night, and I was blown away by the food. My boyfriend and I shared a double order of ribs, a pulled pork sandwich, and a pound of wings. We could've done without the pulled pork sandwich (it ended up being too much food, and honestly, the ribs and wings were so good that the sandwich got a little bit lost). They have a good beer selection too, and all for a fair price. Our server was knowledgable about the food and beer (I didn't get his name, but I have a feeling he's the bar manager...), and genuinely seemed to care about our experience. We had an amazing time, eating delicious food, and drinking some tasty beers. We will DEFINITELY be going back."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Been here a few times and service has always been great. Personally prefer brisket but other stuff is good too. 

Very kid friendly. 

Only mild complaint so far was the calamari appetizer as it was a little disappointing in quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Wanted to take my boyfriend somewhere different and I remember coming her a couple years ago and I enjoyed it. 

So he ordered the half pound beef brisket and I ordered the jalape√±o cheddar burger. Both were fantastic, yes my bun was slightly soggy none the less still enjoyable.

The service was wonderful! Cassandra was great, gave great suggestions. 

I know for sure my boyfriend loved it and we will definitely be coming back. Thank you."}
{"text":"Girls Day! The Mac & Cheese $8 is cooked in a small cute dish pan, you would be surprised at how filling it is. The sweet potato fries $7 are the bomb even my friends who usually hate sweet potato fries actually enjoy these. Crunchy on the outside yet soft on the inside and not TOO sweet. Smoked Pulled Pork Poutine $12 huge (had to share it) everything about it is to die for definitely a cheat day! 

Now for  the Stack shakes... OMG DEFFF worth a try! I shared the Oreo cookie shake $7 and my other friend tried the The Shaketender surprise $7. They were both amazing def vanilla ice cream based so if you like vanilla ice cream def recommend."}
{"text":"Wawawewa!~!! AMAZING!  Service was good, friendly and fast! Bang Bang Shrimp dish was YUMMY...  got a little ting to it.  Delicious! 

They don't cheap out on wine and are great to observe if you are running low.  

FOOD : BOMB!!! The brisket beef was soooooooooooooooooooooooo Good! The jack Daniel bbq sauce on top of it was divine.  The French fries are hand-cut and delicious as well.  The cole slaw - How can a cole slaw taste so good?!?! REALLY!!! So Good!

Overall, DEFINITELY going to be craving all the flavours I had...in fact, I already am!"}
{"text":"Grabbed takeout from this restaurant so I can't comment on the service. I can say, however, that the staff was very friendly when we showed up to pick up our meal. BF and I ordered: JD Brisket & Burger, Double Grilled Cheese & Bacon Burger, and some Oreos Donuts for dessert. 

All I can say is...holy moly! The fat kid in me was jumping for joy with each bite of our order. The brisket burger was so flavorful and juicy, and the grilled cheese burger was a buttery cheesy mess. When I first saw the grilled cheese burger I was worried they had skimped on the cheese but nope, the darn thing came together really well. 

And the donuts...*drool drool*. I would go back just for another order of donuts. A box of little golden ooey gooey rings for $8? Works for me haha.

TLDR; good burgers, GREAT donuts...nuff said."}
{"text":"I went to Stack on Sunday afternoon with a friend we went with the choose your own BBQ platter - Ribs, Brisket, Mac n' Cheese, Parmesan Fries - and it was wonderful. The Mac and cheese was good but could be better, but it comes down to what one is looking for in their Mac n' Cheese. The Parmesan Fries were also delicious and a pleasant surprise. 

The ribs were fall of the bone , the brisket was soft and flavourful. The BBQ sauces that they topped the meat with was the icing on a cake well done. 

I also ordered the Fried Breaded Smoked Sausage with Chipotle dipping sauce. That was also very well done. 

The important question is will I be back? Yes I will."}
{"text":"Fall off the bone ribs!!!! Got the half rack with fries, beans and coleslaw for $20. SO WORTH IT and what a price! Damnnn everything was delicious. Bottomless pop $3.50

My bf had the same thing but with chicken also and it was $25. The chicken was a bit dry and the mash was dry as well -- just stick with the fries, they're delicious! 

We also tried the fish tacos which were pretty good $12 -- light and fresh! 

We got seated right away, patio seats! And our waiter was very attentive. Definitely a bargain for the price and taste! I would come back in a heartbeat and had that platter!"}
{"text":"I like this place. The restaurant is laid out with thought. The decor is nice too. We were quickly shown to our seats when we walked in. Despite only having three people serving the floor things went pretty smoothly. I ordered the bacon burger minus cheese & mayo (dairy allergy) with a gluten free bun & a side order of sweet potato fries. Hubby had the Catfish with mash. The food was delicious. I think they forgot my sweet potato fries coz they came later than my burger. When they came the fries were nice and crispy in a lattice shape. Not too oily either, which is a pet peeve of mine. 

I tried a bite of hubby's catfish and it was delicious too. Our waitress was nice and efficient. When she was busy the other ppl serving the floor (2 guys) came by as well. The guy who was acting as expediter came by and said \"Awesome right?\" with a big smile and I smiled back and said \"Yeah!\"  I visited the washrooms before we left and the women's was immaculate. Hubby said the men's was clean as well. I don't know how new this place is but everything was in tip top shape. And fastidiously clean. Another pet peeve of mine is when restaurants don't pay much attention to their washrooms. I've been in nice restaurants where the washrooms felt like the inside of a freezer and were a little dirty. I appreciate this place because everything was done really well. Food, service, decor, and washrooms were all great. I would definitely eat here again when I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Was a very nice and friendly place. Service was great, food was good. Only reason not five is that the meat patty didn't have much taste to it which means they are not using the best beef but that is just me. Others seemed fine with all the condiments on theirs. the grilled cheese part of my burger was great!"}
{"text":"Went to Stack last night for the first time. We shared the platter. It was decent. It was a good amount of food for the price and the fries were excellent, as was the mac and cheese. Unfortunately those sides were the best of the platter. 

As for the rest, everything had too much sauce. I don't like when everything is drowning in sauce because you can't taste the actual bbq. The sauce was fairly tasty, mind you, but it was too much. I dug to find some of everything that was unsauced. The brisket was great texture. It was cooked perfectly which is tough to do. It lacked seasoning and any sort of bark which is my favourite part. The pulled pork was again lacking some seasoning and bark and was a little dry. The ribs had nice bark, but fell apart completely when trying to eat them. To me, that means over cooked. The chicken was a little dry and again lacked seasoning. The corned beef was very good. 

Having said all that, it wasn't bad. It just wasn't great. As I stated, it was decent. It was late in the night, so I'll attribute the dryness and lack of bark on the fact that the food had probably been made earlier in the evening and held in a warmer. 

The service was amazing as our server was very attentive and funny. I will go back to try it again, earlier in the evening, or during a busier time to see if the \"freshness factor\" is what affected the food as I suspect. 

The s'mores donut dessert was killer, btw."}

Buyer beware of how they treat their employees! I was recently hired after two days and two hours worth of interviews. I started my training. Prior to coming in for training, I downloaded the menu and learned the entire thing, before my first shift. I did orientation and was expediting and food running for the remainder of my shift. The shift went great and I was given a drink menu and told I would be called and told the rest of my training shifts. I waited a week, called and sent several emails, to finally get a response a week later telling me they had \"over hired\" and wouldn't be needing me. It's worth noting that while on shift I heard one of the servers complain that they had no days off and I heard the manager discussing with the owner, about a guy they wanted to hire from Real Sports. So clearly you have shifts for me! I wasn't even given an opportunity to serve, which I excel at and have 15 years experience in some amazing restaurants. I'm loyal, hardworking and a team player. I also am three credits short of graduating from Osgoode, so I'm not an idiot either. I also have bills to pay and obligations and don't have the luxury to wait around a week, for a job I don't have. Personally I would not want to give my money to people who treat other people so thoughtlessly. Nobody deserves to be treated this way. It's just common decency to treat people respectfully and to respect their time and effort."}
{"text":"One of the best! Definitely give the ultimate platter a try! Obviously you need to be minimum 3-4 persons for that!"}
{"text":"Really great service and tasty food. I'm not a big fan of saucy BBQ or ribs, but there's plenty more to eat here than that. The tacos are amazing - especially when they have them as daily specials (e.g. jerk pork!), and paninis are really good too. And I always try to leave room for their donuts... So very soft and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"One word: donuts. Oh and all the meat is really good.  Not a fan of some of the chicken, it can come out dry.  The wings are good though.

But all the burgers and brisket and other bbq dishes are all spot on.  Great place to fulfill this craving."}
{"text":"Best brisket in Toronto, but not best I've ever had.

Friends and I were craving some southern BBQ so we ended up at stack. I ordered their brisket burger with a patty, bf ordered the brisket dinner, and friend ordered another burger (don't remember the name of it).

Service was really slow which was unfortunate. But when the food arrived, all of it was really tasty and made up for the wait.

The baked beans are some of the best that I've ever had and I ended up eating the whole thing. The brisket itself was very tender and tasty. Their jack daniels BBQ sauce is also really good - I would order some more on the side next time.

My friend also really enjoyed his burger and said it was the best he's ever had.

The only downsides about this place were the price, waiting time if you don't have a reservation, and service. 

It's a bit overpriced in my opinion even though it's really good southern BBQ. 

I would still come here again when I'm craving brisket and baked beans though!"}
{"text":"The ultimate platter ($75)
This platter serves 3-5 people, I shared this among 4 people including myself with leftovers. Starting from the center is the bbq ribs. There were 2 racks, each half approximately 5 pieces. Below it to the left is the chicken breast marinated in their house peppercorn sauce. Not sure why the sauce was yellow, but the chicken tasted dry. The bottom left was the smoked meat, beside it was the pulled pork, and beside that was the beef brisket. My favorite wad the ribs. The meat was so soft and tender, not the slide off the bone kind but the fall off the bone kind when you bite into it. The pulled pork sauce was spicy hot, i really liked that kick of heat. The beef brisket was tender too. It originally came with normal fries but we upgraded to sweet potatoe fries which was really good - it was double fried crispy. The mac and cheese was nothing special, slightly tasteless imo. The platter was slighty pricey for the amount of meat but its worth it to try all their meats. I would come back for the ribs."}
{"text":"We bought the platter for $75 and at first looked decent, tasty ribs, large chicken breast, brisket was okay but the pull pork was NOT fresh, it was slimy and sour, like rotten meat. Then we were afraid to eat the food close by and worried about contamination. No one got sick but still .... A sour finale to our excitement. Mac and cheese, coleslaw and beans were okay nothing spectacular and mash potatoes that we also got were plain, just a bested potato no chives or sour cream or butter. Good dry rub wings."}
{"text":"Excellent... no other words...

Falling off tasty ribs, good tacos, good donut desserts... efficient service...
And not that expensive

wooaaa!"}
{"text":"So... I am a rather huge fan of BBQ and beef brisket, and I'm sure that factored into my decision to marry a girl from Texas.  I have been to some pretty darn good places in Houston for BBQ, such as Killen's and Ruby's. So naturally I made it a mission of mine to locate good BBQ in Toronto.  STACK certainly comes very close to the texture, tenderness, and flavour of what I have been fortunate enough to enjoy in the deep south.  My wife and I had a pretty good idea of what we wanted when visiting STACK.  We ordered 2 of the following:

TEXAS BRISKET - $12.00 
Seasoned, smoked and carved to order. Served with chipotle Jack Daniels sauce, crispy onions and garlic dill aioli on a fresh bun on the menu

The brisket was a little drier than I would have liked, however it was marbled quite nicely and the fatty pieces were flavoured and cooked exceptionally well.  The JD sauce had a great kick to it and fried onions were a nice touch.

While not quite Texas caliber, it was a great meal.  Texas will probably always own us in the world of BBQ... much like we own them in Hockey!"}
{"text":"made a mistake by not making a reservation on a sunday night. had to wait a little over an hour to fit a table of 7 but the wait was well worth it.
we ordered the platter and upgraded everything. i think we were so hungry that we devoured our meal in about 20 minutes.
everything was delicious.
the main thing i want to talk about are the ribs. the ribs were so succulent and juicy. fall off the bone. the sauce on the ribs was mild but with the right sauce choice, these could be easily one of the best ribs i've had.
i still have some side effects of food coma while writing this.
the service was great by the way. chris, our server was on top of everything and very sociable. i felt extremely welcome here and it felt as though chris was a friend of ours who just happened to work there."}
{"text":"Stack is a BBQ/Smokehouse restaurant that I've returned to for it's convenient location (midtown right on subway line), great atmosphere, and filling food. 

FOOD: Quite a selection of BBQ sandwiches and smokehouse items. The \"Deli-Smoked Meat\" was fantastic - tender and tasty, but not too salty either. 

If you and a few friends are really hungry, try \"The Ultimate Platter\" (Baby-back ribs, chicken, pulled pork, brisket, smoked meat along with fries, mac and cheese, beans, buns) for $75. Unlike some places that embellish serving sizes, this platter really WILL serve 3-5 people. My two friends and I struggled to finish this platter off on our own, and easily could have used another mouth. 

SUMMARY: Good place to grab a drink and fill your belly with some BBQ goodness. Not quite a sports bar, but a decent place to watch the game as well."}
{"text":"I think this place was a little bit overhyped for me by my friends. The fact that they have these ginormous platters for sharing had stirred up all the excitement but it's definitely not the best bbq i have ever had. In fact, from a BBQ standpoint, it might just be mediocre. The platter had  chicken, ribs, brisket, etc. I didnt really have a preference as none of it was all that smoky or juicy. I did get their bartender's milkshake, which is surprise flavour and as it was near xmas - it was egg nog flavour, which was pretty cool.

The owner is really really friendly, out of his way friendly, and the atmosphere is good. I'm just not that impressed with the food and wouldnt go out of my way to come down to the highly dense traffic in this neighourhood for it."}
{"text":"When you need some good ol' bar-be-Qin', you need to be prepared for two things: being insanely full, and having your hands smell like BBQ until your next shower. 

I lucked out with parking and ended up literally in front of the restaurant, paying an easy $2 for metered parking. It's not a crazy busy area, so street parking is completely do-able. 

We got seated upstairs and promptly ordered the Ultimate Platter (feeds 3-5 people), because naturally 3 girls will finish that, right? Just before our food arrives, we were very politely asked if we'd be willing to move to another table. The reason was a large party was coming in, with lots of kids, and our table would be smack dab in the middle of it. They didn't want our dinner to be disturbed by the ruckus. No problem at all, we moved to a new table, and lo and behold, they were SO RIGHT. The kids must have been fed some candy and coke before hand, because they were insanely loud. Grateful for the thoughtfulness of the staff.

The food itself was very good too. The platter included baby back ribs, smoked meat, pulled pork, brisket, half a roasted chicken, baked mac and cheese, tons of fries, coleslaw and some halved buns to DIY sandwiches. Needless to say....STUFFED. Highlights were ribs - fall off the bone, and mac * cheese was gooey hearty-ness. Chicken a bit dry tho.

As an apology for the inconvenience of moving us, we also received a free dessert. It was a bit overkill for us to have dessert too, but we couldn't resist the S'Mores donut. SO GOOD!  

The food was good, but service was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Please, I urge you to come HUNGRY. This is a BBQ place!! Once you step into this place you will instantly smell the BBQ aroma circulating in the air but don't worry, the aroma itself will not fill you up!

The menu was extensive and quite overwhelming. We asked our server for recommendations and he suggested the beef brisket, baby back ribs or fish tacos. These three items were the best seller/most popular on the menu. After having him enlighten us with several suggestions, we decided to opt in for the fish tacos and the baby back ribs with beef brisket. The fish tacos were AMAZING! Soft tortilla shells loaded with a very generous portion of ingredients. It was extremely messy when eating these things especially when my tortilla shells became soggy from absorbing all the sauce which led my taco into a mini avalanche. But hey... what's a taco without mess? The tacos where so good, it got me licking every bit of it off my fingers! Light yet filling, perfect for those who cannot eat much meat like myself haha. 

I tried a bit of the beef brisket from my friend and yes, it was very TENDER - the outstanding adjective that many Yelpers used to describe this bad boy. Our server was not lying when he told us the ribs had large chunks of meat on them and it t falls off the bones effortlessly. 

Overall, very impressed with the degree of service here. Our server was very knowledgeable about the items on the menu and he was very conversational! Made our whole dining experience a comforting and pleasant one. Will return for more BBQ!!!"}
{"text":"I've made a couple of trips back to Stack. I feel like it deserves better than the 3-star review I wrote for it initially. They are very consistent and I've liked everything I've had here so far. On my last visit, I brought a group of eight and everyone had good experience. I have to commend them for keeping their staff so well-informed and up to date with the menu. Our waiter was a true beer aficionado. I hate it when I ask a waiter/waitress a question about the food or drink and they respond with \"let me go ask the kitchen\" or \"I actually haven't tried that\". Our insightful waiter helped me pick out a fantastic beer called Witty Traveller. Made by Railway City in St. Thomas, Ontario, the light tasting brew had a great layering of spices and fruit flavours. The beer was poured right and served at a perfect temperature. 

I love that they pay tribute the the great beer made right here in Ontario. They have a great craft selection from Mill St., Muskoka, Spearhead, Camerons, Black Oak, Flying Monkey's etc. Their Guest Tap is an awesome concept and you can always count on a fantastic new award-winning brew. 

The mac n' cheese is delicious. It's made with a creamy three cheese bechamel sauce and sprinkled bread crust. They serve it in a tiny cast iron skillet. I recommend saying YES to bacon because it makes it so much better."}
{"text":"Stack considering the hype I thought was meh 

*please note didn't try brisket or ribs or doughnuts which have combined for the best reviews here* 

We tried pulled pork, burgers, Mac and cheese with jalape√±o sausage and all of the food was decent run of the mill. 

I personally found The macaroni too hard, the cheese didn't complement well and it lacked bread crumbs that create the crunch. Will never order Mac and cheese here again. 

Please note the owner was extremely nice and served with a huge smile."}
{"text":"We arrived, the restaurant was pretty empty.  I have to mention that it was a weeknight though.  What I noticed even more was the lack of BBQ smells.  Who knows, maybe they have a great ventilation system unlike Korean BBQ places.  So we ordered the platter and the food arrived shortly.  There was a good amount of food that arrived.  Whats included:  baby back ribs, quarter chicken, pulled pork, brisket, smoked meat, fries, mac & cheese, beans, slaw and buns.  This platter feeds 3-5 people, and we had 4 people.  I wish I could say the food was so good, because everything looked good, but it wasn't.  Nothing here was particularly memorable.  What I do remember is the chicken being super dry (so dry to the point that my friend really didn't want to finish it, but because he didn't want to waste food, he ate it while drinking A LOT of water), the brisket having no smoke flavour, smoked meat being super salty, and mac & cheese being cold.  And for a platter that is supposed to serve 3-5 people, why are there only 2 buns?  Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"This place was great! Good atmosphere and delicious food. I ordered the burger and inhaled the entire things within minutes. My only complaint was having the walk up and down two flights of stairs to go to the bathroom."}
{"text":"STACK is the ultimate paradise for men. Even their bloody ceasar is garnished with a strip of smoked meat. Be prepared to wait a while for a seat, but it's definitely worth it.

Ultimate platter is a feast for at least 4 hungry hungry hippos .$64 can get you a whole rack of fall-of-the-bone ribs, slow-cooked pulled pork, and a whole rotisserie chicken sauced anyway you like.. plus a mountain of fries... still not enough? comes with 3 buns, smoked beans, and baked mac and cheese.

If you're super hungry : go for the STACKS challenge: 2 Stacks burger, a pound of fries, and milkshake.. finish in 30 mins and it's yours for free!"}
{"text":"Stack has a decent local crafted beers on tap. Love how the menu has tasting notes and style for each of the beers too.

Sadly, when I was there, they were out of the Beau's Seasonal.. and my waiter start recommended me another Beau's and I kept asking what beer, he said Beau's... (Maybe he doesn't realize how many different beers Beau's brews...)

For food, we shared:

Side Caesar Salad ($5) - Why? But a good option if you want some healthy option.. I didn't order or eat that....
BBQ Ribs ($18) - Meaty and you can even upgrade to a full rack for ($24) great to share it with your dinner mate
Stack Brisket ($10) -  that is just for the sandwich alone. A little pricey for what it is. I doubt I would order that again!

Tips: save room for dessert or come back just for dessert! Or bring someone that wants to eat dessert! 

I need to come back for those mini doughnuts! I want Oreo/S'more/Old Fashion Doughnuts!"}
{"text":"Ultimate platter is delicious. Maybe not the bread. Bread was cold and dry. Bleh. And yes you can upgrade to parmesan fries. 5 stars still regardless of bad bread."}
{"text":"I went to STACK on a Tuesday evening. As soon as i walked in i could taste the smoky goodness. From Pulled Pork to Fish tacos this menu had it all. All fresh food, local Craft Beers and the most Unreal S'mores Doughnuts. Although sweet I was able to wash them down with a great loose leaf tea. I ended up having the 1/4 chicken meal with the yellow sauce. It was soooooo good. I had seen them pulling the chicken out of the smoker as soon as i walked in and i had to order it. I did not regret anything expect for the tight pants i wore that evening. Next time it will be stretchy pants and a whole lot of ribs to eat."}
{"text":"STACK is one of those finds you want to tell all your friends about! From the moment my friends and I walked in, we knew from the packed booths and size of the line that we would be in for a treat!

Thankfully after a 10 minute wait, we were promptly seated (the place is pretty big, so tables turnover pretty fast). The menu is full of carb heavy comfort foods, so if you're watching your weight you should probably sit this one out ;)

My 3 friends and I ordered the Ultimate Platter and soft drinks (bottomless, no less) and were stuffed to the brim with deliciousness. The platter included mac n cheese, fall off the bone ribs, pulled pork (slightly on the dry side to be honest), tender beef brisket, crispy (super yummy) fries, and cole slaw. It was DEFINITELY enough food for four (could arguably feed 6).

For dessert, we had their old fashioned doughnuts - a cone full of small donut rings sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. It was out of this world!! Served warm, the donuts were so soft and the sweetness was just right. I would come back just for these!

Overall this was an amazing restaurant, great service and delicious food. 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"STACK on deck! What a great place for a burger or smokehouse BBQ! The place consists of two floors and plenty of seating, clean and nicely decorated. Just a word of advice, come hungry!

If eating with 3 or more, I'd recommend the platter as it'll have a taste of everything you could want: pulled pork, now ribs, chicken, and smoked meat, Mac and cheese, beans and coleslaw and feeds about 5 hungry souls max.

The meat was fall off the bone and very tasty. I'd recommend upgrading  to the Parmesan fries -- the platter comes with two servings of regular fries.

Overall it was a good dining experience, staff was friendly and food was tasty!"}
{"text":"Came here after a volleyball tournament with my starving team and it definitely hit the spot. We walked in without reservations and they were able to accommodate our whole group. Lots of seating! Food was delicious. Really enjoyed the Mac and cheese along with the brisket. Has the s'more donuts and they were fabulous and really great for sharing."}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal at Stack: half rack of ribs with chipotle Jack Daniels sauce, fries, baked beans and coleslaw. Then, for desert, a stack of s'mores doughnuts. My co-eater had the macaroni and cheese and spicy beef tacos. It was all good.

They have a great selection of Ontario craft beers. The service was super... helpful and polite and knowledgeable. Definitely gonna return to try other menu items."}
{"text":"This place was RAD. They actually got the entire second floor reserved for my friend's birthday. We were only bothered when a kid came upstairs to try and sell us chocolate! He was quickly escorted out luckily. 

Multiple servers would come by to take orders which was great since it was a big party. Good selection of craft beer, I went right to the main course which was a Cuban sandwich. Grilled to perfection and loaded with meat and toppings, I was satisfied. The pickle the used on the sandwich was huge, as a pickle fan I was impressed. Restaurants usually go easy on the pickles.

Overall I enjoyed my visit, will recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"3.5

Decided to grab a burger because the waitress recommended them. They have a HUGE Paige of burgers (at least 10 different kind), all for around 12.99. I got the avocado and bacon one. REALLLLY good. Tons of avocado, liked the bun, meat was pretty tasty.. Above average restaurant burger forsure! 

Only problem... IT DOESNR COME WITH FRIES, and a side order of fries cost 4.99! 
NOT COOL!!!! who orders a burger from a restaurant and it doesn't come with a side of fries.... Boooooo

Oh, and their ribs look INSANELY delicious. Will be coming back here for those. Apparently they're known for their ribs. 

Overall: really solid meal but the fries for 4.99 took a star off for me."}
{"text":"Found Stacks while looking for a good BBQ burger and craft beer selection for my birthday lunch. It was a bit of a jaunt from the bloor subway line, but good gracious we knew this was a win when we could smell it three buildings away. 

My wife had a brisket sandwich and it was easily the most flavoured and moist brisket I've ever had. How do you improve that? While I had it on top of a gorgeous burger. This was a delicious flavour bomb and it was only accelerated by a great craft beer selection (includes rotating taps) and some amazing fries. 

3/4's through my meal I realised I was getting pretty full, but that I was continuing to eat because there taste was more important than discomfort :)

It was painful, but with it. 

Desert menu looked great and there is even a cool shake menu. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try.  So, here it goes...
1.  Decent ambiance but very loud music.
2. Big screen TV's located on walls above booths so you can't even see them!
3. Decor is pretty plain.  The place needs some livening up.
4.  Service was quite good and waiter was pleasant.
5. Good salads, fish and burgers.
6.  I asked for lemon for my water...waiter brought it over in the palm of his hand! 
7. Reasonable prices for what you get.

I'd recommend it because it really wasn't a bad experience.  I just wish they would
do something with the decor.  It was kind of sad looking since the sign outside made me think it was going to me a really special place."}
{"text":"Went here for my fathers birthday the other night, it was fantastic we went and they said it would be able 30-40min wait for a table so they asked if we would like to sit at the bar, we were about to order drinks and our table was already ready, the service was great, very friendly staff and great sense of humor, we got chicken quesadillas and bang bang shrimp to start,.both were fantastic great flavor the corn salsa with the quesadillas was amazing. I ordered the pulled pork, with a side of chick pea salad, very flavorful great mixture of beans and flavors. The pulled pork was very tender and lean juicy and delicious on a fresh bun as they advertise. Mum got the catfish tacos and sweet potato fries, I tried both, both were great, well cooked and seasoned. Dad got the brisket and poutine, fresh bun, tender meat, great bbq sauce, poutine wasn't too salty. My brother got the Stack burger which is a pound of meat, 4 slices of bacons, 2 slices of cheddar, caramelized onions and fries. It was a huge burger, 2 thick parties, very juicy, looked fantastic he in enjoyed if veryy much. We were all very happy with the experience, it was our first time and we will definitely be going back. It was amazing."}
{"text":"Where to start with this place...first of all, it was so clean you could have eaten off the floor. A rare site anywhere. 
Our server KAT was awesome, very knowledgeable, easy-going and never made us feel rushed.
Between the 2 of us we tried the ribs, the chicken, mac and cheese, baked beans and slaw, oh and can't forget the fresh cut french fries! All of it was delicious! 
The ribs fell off the bone, the chicken was tasty and not dry (for you guys who hate the word moist ;) )
Fast and friendly with reasonable prices. The owner even came over to check in on us, really nice man!
Oh and a special shout out to server Jodie, very cool guy!
This Buffalo girl was thoroughly impressed! Highly recommend this place to anyone who like smoked
 meat!"}
{"text":"My first impression of this place was that it would be a high end smokehouse.  I was way off. 

The place is run by young students. Clearly inexperienced and wanting to be else where.   The hostess showed a lack of interest.  We had to wait for a table at the bar. There was about 100 dirty cups in front of us. So gross. 
2/5 for service
2/5 for cleanliness 

Half way through our meal, the power went off. Lucky us lol

We ordered the Texas brisket and fresh donuts. It was off the charts. Brisket was melt in your mouth   However presentation suck balls. Literally sandwich on a plate

2/5 for presentation
4.5/ 5 for brisket

Even though my experience here wasn't the best, I'm willing to come again. The food speaks for itself. Hopefully everything else will improve. If not, take out it is"}
{"text":"Hmmm, Stack, what to say....simply....AMAZING!  The service was very good and the food was quick and tasted delicious! Stack specializes in smoked meat and sandwiches so obviously I had to get both, I would recommend my meal to anyone who likes smoked brisket.  My meal was a Texas Brisket with thick cut home style Fries, the meat in the sandwich was very juicy and tendor, and the buns, even know they look like hamburger buns, they were a lot more!  The buns were in fact hamburger buns made in house by the chefs, the were soft and fluffy and made a very good addition to the sandwich.  The fries were also very crispy and salted perfectly! I have given Stack 5 stars because I believe they have figured out how to make an amazing restaurant with great service and great servers. That is why Stack has made 5 stars on my list!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  Maybe it was an off night for them.  I don't know.

Though small looking from the outside, this place is quite large inside - especially since it is multi-story.  Stepping inside, you would not think it was a ribs and burger joint.  The nicely decorated place with classy lights and comfortable booths look more like a fine steak restaurant.  Even the stair case to the bathrooms were really nice.  Something you find in an upgraded house.
On to the food.  We ordered with back ribs, brisket with slaw, fish tacos, and stackhouse burger.  We also had a couple of brews.
First of all, the ribs that they served us were dry as a desert!  Really?!?  Why would they serve that?  They took it away and re-fired us a new one.
The brisket and slaw sandwich comes with nothing at all.  Just a sandwich on a large plate - no sides were given or offered.  It was also overly sweet - perhaps too much BBQ sauce.  The fish taco's had more mushy dressing than fish - if you like really good ones, go to Kensington market and line up at Seven Lives.  The burger's pulled pork topping was not a big hit and it was left on the plate.
Don't get me wrong, there was at least two items that we liked.  The beers!  And the staff was fantastic.  I just feel that we spent a lot of cash and got nothing out of it.
For a Friday night and prime time dinner hour, the place was not packed and there was no waiting.  Again, maybe an off night.  
Probably won't go back.  There are a few good rib joints that spend less money on decor and more on food quality and quantity up in the 905.

A 2.5 star experience!"}
{"text":"Plain old great grub for the lumberjack and his damsel. It ain't always pretty (bbq rarely is anyway) but it's hearty and incredibly saucy and delicious - from the ribs, beans, slaw and fries made messy with extra sauce - wow."}
