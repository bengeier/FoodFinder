{"text":"Kaleidoscope Café is small (probably about 10 tables) and off the beaten path.  But this place is well worth seeking out.  The small-ish menu features local ingredients prepared simply and deliciously.  I had a satisfying bowl of potato-leek soup and delicious cornish game hen (with herby, crispy skin and topped with sautéed grape tomatoes and figs) for my main.  The chef also whipped up a special appetizer of tortilla chips and Middle Eastern-spiced bean dip for us after hearing that I needed a gluten free meal.  Details like that and our waiter's attentive (but not overbearing) service made me a fast fan.  Can't wait to dine here again on my next visit to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised by the high reviews on yelp.  We went for dinner and the place was pretty dead, except for a lively group of ladies, I can only assume were the Real Housewives of PGH.  They were fully taking advantage of the BYOB and had about 5 bottles of wine with them.

Overall the food was pretty average.  The flavors are strong, but definitely on the heavy side.  The dishes were unique, but again the flavors were just really strong and not that complex.  The best dish we had was the grilled cheese.  We also ordered the Cow Jumped Over the Moon (don't order this if you like Gorgonzola) and the Gnocchi Nirvana (again heavy, and basically big blobs of gnocchi in pasta sauce, I'm more used to smaller chewy morsels vs these large tater tot looking pieces).

Service and decor were great, but I don't think I will be back anytime soon.  Unless I get an invite to the Real Housewives of PGH, they seemed like a fun bunch."}
{"text":"Have been here twice during restaurant week and have thoroughly enjoyed it each time. Their salads are fresh, colorful, and flavorful with great homemade dressings. Every meal has a great combination of flavors, and it is inexpensive to Byob.  The last time we went, my tuna was perfectly cooked, and the cucumber coleslaw went very well. When the avocado is the least interesting aspect (and I love avocado) that is saying something. The only complaint is that the food usually takes a long time. The place is small and had been full each time we have been, so make sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Had a special dinner here with Jamie and Asia. Sweet potato bisque, Mediterranean Salad, Gnocchi Nirvana and the Cow Jumped Over the Blue Moon. Ate it all and cleaned our plates. Finished with Flourless Chocolate Torte. Good service and excellent company with Jaymet and Asia!"}
{"text":"I just a had the best pulled pork sandwich from there.  I have been on the hunt for a good pulled pork sandwich for a while, and this one is excellent. I opted for fruit instead of fries, and was pleased to see a freshly cut apple and cranberries instead of the soggy fruit side most places give you.  I liked that the fruit was seasonal as well.  I got take-out, so I can't attest to the waitstaff.  But the gentleman at the front was very nice (maybe the owner).
My husband and I are always looking for something easy and laid back on the weekends.  Next time, we will try sitting down here.  I never think of it because the location is tucked away.  But now I can't stop thinking about that sandwich so I definitely won't forget it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was on my list of must-tries for a while, and was I right or what!  My friend and I visited late on a Saturday. We got the fried gnocchi for an app, which was a great app size but of course I wished it was bigger. The gnocchi was just the right texture (some people kill that stuff). They also provided toasted pita chips in leu of the bread or chips. Yum. My friend got the Cow Jumped Over the Blue Moon Pasta, and I got the Scallops Beurre Noisette. Again, the scallops were cooked just right, and the sauce complimented the light scallop flavor beautifully. We both preferred our choice to the other's, which is usually how it goes when we eat out. Both dishes had very strong flavors, so you need to love your choice.

We were too full for dessert, but I plan to go back late one night and order just all the desserts. There are three, and I have heard great things about the Poached Pear from a co-worker who frequents the place.

I also love the size as I love the homey feel with a touch of fun design. The night we were there, there was a group of 8 or so girls, and one of them thought it necessary to do a screaming-laugh for about 5 seconds straight--you know, the piercing kind. Ouch. So--great acoustics also! But she couldn't ruin the food or the ambience for me, it was just too good, exactly what I was looking for that night."}
{"text":"Had Lunch today with my Dee, warm Brussel Sprout Salad . so delicious!!!  Perfect serving size, light yet filling. Ordered with chicken. Really so good. Plan on seeing if I can get take out for lunch!! Work in Shaler, 15 minutes away. Great place, desert was great as well. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"A starving version of myself placed a to-go order by phone and was thrilled when they said it would be ready in ten minutes. Not only did they deliver on the timing, they delivered on deliciousness! My stomach was certainly happy.

I had a large salad and a soup, which tasted fresh and healthy while still being satisfying. The Mr. got the pulled pork sandwich, which he said was amazing. We are glad we discovered Kaleidoscope and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super friendly people and delicious food, all only a few blocks from my house!

I arrived for a group dinner party only to end up waiting a half-hour for my friends to arrive-awkward-but the waiter was incredibly friendly. Then, the food.  Delish.  The duck cannelloni were amazing, the gnocchi not too heavy, and they have a deal where if you order a certain combination of entrees and apps you get a free bottle of wine. Not bad.  

I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"If Pittsburgh is the next foodie city -- and the cuisine is beginning to catch up with the hype -- I hope more places are like Kaleidoscope Cafe (more so than Salt Of The Earth and the like) ... and here's why:

You get all the adventurous food, layering of flavors, inventive combinations, fresh ingredients -- but for about 35% less our of your wallet (and about 25% more content on your plate).  Rather than detail everything we ate and what was great, good, or OK (and the food is solidly at about an 8 1/2 out of 10) here are the headlines:

YOU ARE PAYING FOR GOOD FOOD COOKED CREATIVELY - INSTEAD OF A LIQUOR LICENSE (they are BYOB -- another savings passed on to you), RENT (the neighborhood Is in the very early stages of gentrification -- very early), or THE DECOR (it's not bad, but it's no post-modern art gallery).

THE PORTIONS ARE MODERATE, THE FLAVORS ARE BIG.

THE CHEF IS ACCESSIBLE AND CARES WHAT YOU THINK OF HIS FOOD (he came around to every table to chat, and for the one customer who had complaints, the chef was eager to do anything to make it right).

WE ORDERED A BOWL OF SOUP (which was a true bowl, not a birdseed holder), TWO APPETIZERS, and TWO ENTREES -- ALL FOR $60.

I not only hope this place makes it, but is a model for what is to come to Pittsburgh:  Creative, tasty, satisfying."}
{"text":"Great upscale comfort food.  The shepherds pie and the coq au vin were both fantastic.  The crab dip was delicious but the sweet potato hush puppies were a real standout for their flavor, texture, and creativity. The owner/chef was super friendly and it was cool to hear a little about each of the dishes."}
{"text":"I would have never found this place had I not gone looking for it, but it's definitely worth the 2 block trek off Butler St.  It's back in a residential area, and did not appear to have any parking of its own (always a problem in Lawrenceville), but I managed to find a street spot without a problem on a Saturday afternoon.

The menu is an interesting mix of salads, pastas, sandwiches and main courses.  The pastas looked really interesting, but I opted for a fried gnocchi appetizer and a pulled duck (yes duck!) sandwich.  The gnocchis were very interesting - deep fried, so they were crispy on the outside, but almost like mashed potatoes in the middle.  They were not like the potato dough gnocchis I'm used to, but they were delicious.  The duck sandwich was excellent - rich and piled high with meaty duck in a lighter vinegar-based BBQ sauce.  It was a nice compliment that didn't completely overwhelm the flavor of the duck.

I'm a lover of anyplace that's BYOB, as this place is.. I'll definitely be back for another go-around, next time with a bottle or two in tow."}
{"text":"1st time here since the transition from river moon, glad to see dan (chef/owner) has addressed noise issues(my pet peeve) with sound absorbent wall and ceiling treatments, i wish many more establishments would do likewise.

 but on to the important stuff- the food, which was just really, really good. i've read the other reviews on yelp & urban-spoon and pretty much agree with all the positives and would like to add my take on an entree that wasn't mentioned (i think) by anyone else-the pasta el aziza. the cider reduction is incredible, bursting with flavor, balancing the tart and sweet of the apples/cider/dates with the heartiness of the turkey and needless to say the farfalle was perfectly al dente. what a unique dish. our waiter, jason had described it as lighter than some other choices, clearly he didn't mean in flavor, if you're looking for a healthy pasta dish-this is it. speaking of jason, he and his assistant were gracious, efficient, and knowledgeable.

for dessert - the chocolate cake, made by josephine(of river moon fame), was not as dense and intense as a similar (superb) offering at legume, but quite acceptably good. the other 3 choices sounded as good or better, but i only had enough room to share the one.

a tip of my cap to chef dan and his staff. i'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. Service was friendly and the atmosphere is unique. Definitely worth giving a try. We will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious, very good food that tastes like home ! For me, right now it is the #1 restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice. You will eat  upscale classic dishes, very knowledgeable staff, easy parking, friendly atmosphere, decent prices (you can get the most amazing pasta marinara with beef for $10), casual environment. Con's: I can see the service going slow in busy times, two of their deserts I tried were so and so, the interior design of the place may need some alterations. I give 5 stars because of all the pros.   

What we tried and liked the most: Farmhouse salad, Chicken sausage appetizer, duck appetizer, pasta marinara with beef, hen entree and pork entree. The pear appetizer is a good choice, the second time I tried it, I liked it much more. BYOB."}
{"text":"I was very glad that I brought my wife here for her birthday. The food, byob wine, and atmosphere made it a special occasion without breaking the bank. 

The food was excellent. My scallops were cooked perfectly and the beef my wife had on her pasta was so tender and tasty. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. I cannot recommend the sausage/baked brie starter...and the Cow Jumped Over the Blue Moon pasta with flank steak...

Sometimes it can be on the chilly side from the A/C, so bring a sweater. 

This place is the bee's knees and I go whenever I can."}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope Cafe is a few streets off Butler in the heart of Lawerenceville's business district. It's housed in a stand-alone row house filled with charm. It's the kind of restaurant that keeps the city vibrant and moving forward as a food destination. The dining room only has 10 or so tables so I'd call ahead just to be safe because this is one meal you won't want to miss.

I've heard good things about Kaleidoscope Cafe but I'm not sure why I didn't know about the deep-fried gnocchi. Seriously, people. Order anything you like on the menu because it all looks amazing, but be sure to add an order of Gnocchi Nirvana as well.

The homemade potato gnocchi is deep fried which is a feat in-and-of itself because according to Chef Dan if you try and deep fry gnocchi it explodes. So personally, I think Kaleidoscope should win awards for being able to even make this dish.

When I think deep fried, I automatically think of a heavy, chewy batter and a greasy taste. This was the exact opposite. It was so light and fluffy, with a light crisp in each bite that they might have replaced Osteria's gnocchi as my favorite in the city. The gnocchi itself was set on top of a bath of kafta (Indian spiced tomato cashew sauce) and topped with bits of chorizo (Soyrizo is also available). The flavors combined together to make a nice blend of mild heat and tang,  a welcomed surprise since when I think gnocchi, I think Italian.

Although the Poached Pear is its speciality, I can't resist chocolate. So I went with the Flourless Chocolate Torte for dessert. Chef Dan said something along the lines of \"this will be the best dessert you ever had.\" And maybe something about it being orgasmic, life-changing... basically a slew of very powerful words that I didn't believe. Boy, was I wrong. I didn't get what he meant until about half-way through my first bite. Then it hit me. The tort was rich and moist and sexy.... if cake could be sexy. And the white chocolate ganache with raspberry hearts was the perfect compliment. That tort was so good that I didn't even offer to share it with my dining partner. Sorry... but not really.

My only really problem with Kaleidoscope Cafe is the fact that I'll never want to try anything else there after this meal. But that's one problem I'm totally fine with..."}
{"text":"The kaleidoscope crab dip was heavy and bland.

The kaleidoscope pasta and the marinara pasta tasted very similar, acidic.  The bacon/pork belly in the k. pasta was not remarkable.  My son loves bacon and loves pasta but did not love this incarnation.

The slow roasted duck was heavy as is and needed more contrast, more sauce.  Was underwhelmed in the restaurant.  And I love duck.  Had left overs and I think it could have been a really Great dish with something like MORE pickled vegetables with crunch on the side as contrast or more sauce with acid...it just needs something more.  But the duck definitely has potential.

Nut allergic son did well.  

It's such a pretty restaurant.  I really wanted to love it and so looked forward with all of the great reviews.  It's decent.  Probably closer to 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner.  Don't miss out on this place.   Had the duck cannoli, crab dip and Cow jumped over the moon pasta.   Service was good, place is clean and cute."}
{"text":"Visiting the in-laws for the holidays. They tend to visit the same 3 restaurants over and over. I took it upon myself to find them something new. We had six people in our party ages 5 to 75 and there was something DELICIOUS for each of us. The service was great; the atmosphere was delightful and the food was outstanding. It seems to be in a more industrial part of town and I was really questioning my decision when we pulled up but don't let the neighborhood or the outside of the building fool you. Eat there!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh salad and the Marinara Sauce for my pasta was amazing. The server and the owner were the friendliest people."}
{"text":"This eclectic restaurant was a lovely surprise. Decorated outside and in with colorful, abstract kaleidoscope motifs, this quiet cafe set a nice tone for an afternoon lunch date.

The owner himself, Dan, waited on us. He knows his menu inside and out (his descriptions of the food alone are mouthwatering), and he isn't afraid to share a story or two. In short, he was delightful. 

We ordered almost exclusively from the specials menu. Each item was a creative variation on a traditional dish, all prepared with unique twists that took the food from good to great. For instance, we split a small plate of broccoli-stuffed egg rolls: perfectly prepared with a flaky, fried shell, and dipped in a cream sauce.

Together, we had a cup of soup, a small salad, and two small plates, and it was more than enough food for the both of us to be full. Still, we could not resist having dessert: a rosemary shortbread with custard and berry glaze: a complex mix of sweet and savory flavors that paired wonderfully with a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Our experience at a restaurant may have a lot to do with timing.  Go during slow hours, and you may be the only party there, as was the case when my brother and I went to Kaleidoscope Cafe.  Arrive on a busy weekend evening, and you're much more likely to find yourself waiting for a table with exasperated staff miserably milling about and food that tastes like it was thrown together in a hurry because it probably was.  Of course, that's just a general rule, and  something tells me that rule doesn't apply here.

This was only my first time here, so I really couldn't say how things would be during busier times.  I will say, my overall experience seems consistent with the other positive reviews Kaleidoscope Cafe has garnered.

With that being said, I have nothing but good things to say about this place and my experience there.  The menu was interesting, the food was good, the staff were all very welcoming, attentive, and affable.  There's a nice spectrum of prices.  Definitely keep in mind it's BYOB and that can certainly free up some money to spend on food, which is really nice.  It's casual, nothing fancy with an interesting mix of Yinzer along with that typical Lawrenceville hipster feel to it.  Whatever it is, the place definitely has its charm, and it's so close yet so far from the comparative hustle and bustle of Butler Street, which of course is a plus when it comes to parking. 

I guess what I'm saying is, this is a very cool little place.  Don't be afraid to give it a try."}
{"text":"I agree witht the below poster -- if you ignore the decor,  you will enjoy the experience and food.  My friend had the vegetarian past (I forget what it was called) and liked it.  I ordered the polenta and liked it.  As others have stated, the gnocchi was delightful.  We ordered two entrees and the small dish deal to receive a free bottle of red wine.  I love free alcohol. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"Fried gnocchi. FRIED GNOCCHI. 

This place is super cute and the food is amazing.

Be careful though, because it's BYOB and you might drink a whole bottle of wine and some fruit punch vodka with sprite and then go to Alleghney Wine Mixer where you drink more wine ... Just sayin. 

The scallops are also awesome, but best of all was the honey butter! I want to eat it on everything!"}
{"text":"The restaurant's food has potential, but the atmosphere is pretty terrible. I \"get\" what they were going for, but it looks like a child was working on a craft and stopped halfway done. As well, if there is more than 5 people in the restaurant, the noise is deafening. Not particularly relaxing with a fancy meal. It was around 6 when we ate. I thought it was odd that they light candles when there is bright overhead lights and huge windows that let in tons of natural light.

The soda was not mixed properly. The BYOB feature is nice, however.

We got the crab dip for an appetizer. It was actually very delicious, lots of crab. Huge portion for the price. I got a small salad that was very tasty and my main course taught me that I hate polenta. My date's pasta was homemade and very hearty. 
The food is excellent, but I just can't justify the prices when the atmosphere is so lackluster."}
{"text":"3.0 / 5 - Pulled Pork: Usually not a huge fan but it was quite good.  Buns are great.
2.5 / 5 - Fries: Great flavor from high quality oil, nice big sea salt, but not always crunchy
3.0 / 5 - Burger: Great bread, high quality lettuce.  Tastes great with options like brie and avocado.  Patty comes out most of the time to be a pretty good medium-rare when ordered rare, though sometimes the edges are cooked a bit too much.
2.5 / 5 - Classic Pasta - light, semi sweet and saltay marinara sauce, lean ground beef, could use a bit more sauce.  
4.0 / 5 - Fried Gnocchi small plate: soft, delicious, light, like pillows.  some of the best I've had. Small portion, though.
1.5 / 5 - Pesto Fish

Great service, very friendly people."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, very much off the beaten path. The food was excellent, the ambiance is very intimate and chill. Great date place or a night out with friends. 
The staff was great in recommending certain dishes and were very accommodating for those with dietary restrictions. 
Highly recommend Kaleidoscope!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for quite some time now and have just not had the right opportunity. Last night, a guest from out of town and I decided that it was the night. Boy, was the wait vindicated!

A humble, small place on a side street so that you'd never see it, Kaleidoscope cafe is small, intimate, and cozy. The art on the walls is appropriately modern, as is the dark blue color on the walls, and each table is hand-painted by a different artist and then lacquered. This makes you want to not only look at your table, but walk around the room and view the entire (small) place. There's even a little kaleidoscope on every table. 

Our server was friendly, had excellent suggestion, and was very accommodating of food allergies and substitutions. For a place that highlighted walnuts, I was able to get nearly anything I wanted nut-free. 

We started with a hot sausage and white bean soup, which was delicious! My friend ordered the salmon and risotto, and I went safe with the filet mignon and garlic mashed potatoes. He was blown away by the risotto and very pleased with the salmon; I couldn't believe the steak. It was the single finest-cooked piece of beef I've ever eaten, flavorful and buttery-tender. 

Desserts were both tasty and creative: a flourless chocolate torte for the safe-minded, and a rosemary shortbread with a lemon custard for something nicely off the beaten path.

The chef made sure to come speak to us after the meal, and that added to the sense that these people really care about what they're doing. 

The restaurant was mildly on the pricy side, and the portions were not as large as I'd have liked - I left after eating soup, entree, and dessert, and was mildly full - but all in all, I don't think there's a restaurant in the city I'm more excited to try again. 

Bravo, Kaleidoscope!"}
{"text":"Great place...! The food was yummy and our server was lovely. We also met the chef . Super food. I had the gorgonzola steak pasta and the crab dip. My son loved it too! My wife and I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite hidden-away spot in Lawrenceville to grab a bottle of wine and have a date night. The space is small and cozy, so I recommend making a reservation just in case. Everything on the menu is fresh and delicious- we especially love the chicken apple sausage small plate with Brie and the scallop pasta, but we've never had a bad meal here. The specials and seasonal menus are also quite good. The service is friendly and it's great if you want to dress up a bit on the weekend or pop over in jeans on a weeknight. We also like to bring out of town guests here for dinner and show them there's amazing food in Pittsburgh tucked away off the main drag of Butler and outside of downtown."}
{"text":"The location of this restaurant always concerns me since it is off the beaten path of Butler Street in Lawrenceville, but it is well worth making that left or right turn for a truly great dining experience.  You can tell the intent of the restaurant by the care given to the design of the buildings exterior.  You can't help staring and comparing it to your childhgood experiences with a kaleidoscope.
Once inside the atmosphere is pleasant and understated with a great fabric art piece expanding to all of the walls.
The service was very good with attention paid to the menu and the servers descriptions of specials and items from the menu which were questioned.  The restaurant has a BYOB policy and were quick to arrive with stemware as well as ice filled wine buckets.
I had the scallops with tomato and onion over farfalle in a browned butter sauce.  The Garden salad, medium sized, was more than adequate and extremely fresh. Water was constantly being filled and plates were removed in a timely manner and without interruption.  The desserts were extremely rich and coupled with a cup of their coffee, the taste lingered.
We left very satisfied with promises to each other that we shall return!"}
{"text":"I went in for a late lunch after reading Darren W.'s review and was not disappointed.  Well, okay, only mildly -- the waiter alerted me that there were no fresh avocados that day (which knocked out almost half of the menu for me since I love them).

The venue was quaint.  There were only about 3 tables occupied including mine.  I finally settled on the scallops beurre noisette over farfalle with a side Kaleidoscope salad (minus the avocados, unfortunately).  The pasta was amaaazzzinnngg.  I never thought I would enjoy walnuts on my pasta so much.  

The rest of the (tiny) menu sounded so enticing, that I'm sure I'll be back for a date night with the hubs."}
{"text":"Went on a first date here a few weeks ago! It was a busy Saturday night, but they managed to squeeze us in. Very personable and friendly staff! The food was fantastic, fresh American cuisine. The chef even paid us a visit to make sure that we were enjoying everything and serves a different style of bread each night! Perfect for a date or a small group. It's BYOB, so make sure to bring a bottle of wine or two!"}
{"text":"Recently had dinner here with a large group of friends. Great food and service. Prices were extremely low for the product, which I assume will change after they start to attract customers. 

I tried a cannolli shell filled with savory duck meat and a dark cocoa sauce (rather than conventional sweet filling) and dusted with pistachio. Excellent. I ate a fresh pasta (you could tell it was made from scratch) with a blue cheese & cream sauce with flank steak. The steak was like the cut you would have in a taco, but it was so tender that it could cut with a fork and had the consistency of liver. 

Definitely try this place. It's BYOB!"}
{"text":"Talk about a surprise gem in Lawrenceville.

Nestled closer to the river on 43rd, Kaleidoscope Cafe stands out among the older houses in the area with its colorful and artistic exterior.  Inside, you'll find low lighting, fun decor, and amazing food.

The service was perfect.  Our waiter was there when we needed him, answered our questions, and gave helpful recommendations.  The service was prompt; keeping our drinks full without interrupting or disturbing our conversation.

For appetizers, the deep fried gnocchi was outstanding.  I never had gnocchi prepared fried, so this was a tantalizing new experience for me.  The gentle crispy outside merely contained the yummy goodness that awaited me as I bit in to the little fried nuggets of delight.  The tomato/marinara sauce served along side was the perfect compliment.

The crab dip with bacon was a match made in heaven.  Two things I can't get enough of; brought together in sweet salty matrimony.  I would have ordered 5, but alas, there was still the main course.

To finish off an already outstanding evening of food, the crusted tuna with lavender mandarin yogurt sauce and pineapple risotto took me over the edge of food bliss.  The tuna was cooked perfectly.  The sauce was delicious without overpowering the fish.  Finally, the risotto was perfectly cooked and complimented the rest of the dish exceptionally well.

Overall, one of the best dinners I've had in a while.  The only flaws I could really find in the place were a lack of linens and the BYOB policy (which is kind of a plus too).  In the end, I barely remember not having linens on my table since what really stuck out was the exceptional food."}
{"text":"We had dinner at 8pm on a Friday night, and we were the only ones there.   I gave myself a pep-talk that it didn't mean anything, it was up & coming and hadn't been discovered...blah blah blah.

I struggled with the menu a bit - the pricing and options are all over the place.   There are entrees in the low $20-30's. Small plates for 7-10, and pasta dishes for 10-15.  They also had salads - sized 'medium' & 'large'.  Maybe it's clear to others, but for some reason this selection and price points was a hodgepodge of trying to figure out what I want.   (And what they are trying to be!)

They have a sandwich/burger menu that my friend had scoped online and was excited about...but they only serve till 5.  We were able to convince them to make us a burger and a fish sandwich.  Both were good  - and highly recommended - but only available at lunch.

I ordered The cow jumped over the blue moon pasta... Gorgonzola, fettucini, and beef.  It was very rich and great! BUT - here is my American-skewed proportion.  It was a small serving.  I'm used to pasta dishes that I can only eat half of.... I cleared my plate and it was a very rich dish.  So - I suppose that's fine.  But it made me confused what a small plate would be???   Then on the other hand, I wanted a small garden salad...for this I ordered a 'medium' .... It was a plain salad, nothing to write home about - but it was way too much.  

Ok, enough rambling....the food was good. Some very good. 
The service was great - very accommodating.

But I'm not sure what group I would come back with...a nice dinner/special occasion - or a more ordinary week night meal? I'm not sure.  I hope they tighten up their menu, find 3-4 killer dishes, and this place could be amazing."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars if it wasn't for the server who was either not very friendly or was having a bad day.  I will choose to believe it was the latter because I enjoyed my food, and have enjoyed this place the few times I've been here. 

When this place was River Moon Cafe they had an unbelievable Salmon linguine dish..BRING IT BACK!!!!!

Anyways,  the Crab dip was chunky, and had corn which I though was a nice touch...very good

My GF had the pork loin...being that pork is my favorite I tasted my fair share of her plate, and thought the pork was tender and not overly spiced, the squash and zucchini were delicious

I had the pan seared basa fish with steamed spinach and a white bean and lobster sauce on the side.  I really enjoyed the fish, the spinach was fairly good, but I didn't care for the sauce.

I will return...hopefully to a more cheerful dining room.  The chef did come out to great the tables and that is always appreciated."}
{"text":"The menu is creative and familiar at the same time. We tried small plates as appetizers  The duck cannolli is amazing. Entrees were shared by all because each of us was impressed and wanted the others to try   We has a great evening."}
{"text":"the menu is small but a variety of options, prices are right and the ingredients are fresh. the coffee was good but I'd recommend they partner with a local roaster. aside from that the veg stack sandwich would have benefitted from a whole wheat kaiser roll"}
{"text":"Clever flavor combinations. Generously apportioned meat on the duck cannoli. Chef Dan is friendly and frequents the dining room to make sure everything is up to par. The flourless chocolate cake was moist and rich without being too decadent. Easy going atmosphere and worth wandering off from Butler St. BYOB. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon Kaleidoscope Cafe while searching for a place that was BYOB with a variety of options on the menu. My first impression was that the building was decorated exactly as the name suggested - with triangles of many colors, as if you were peering into an actual kaleidoscope! It was hard to miss as this restaurant sits right on the outskirts of residential living. Parking is difficult to find as it is on-street only, however we were lucky enough to find a spot right behind the restaurant.  

We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door, around 4pm on a Saturday afternoon, and the host inquired whether we were interested in the lunch or dinner menu - a nice jester as he could have just handed us a dinner menu and we would not have known any different. He seated us in a completely empty dining room (as 4pm is an unusual time to eat) and offered to put the beer we had brought into a cooler until we were ready to drink it. The menu was diverse, with unique twists to the food. We tried the Fried Gnocchi for an appetizer and it just melted in your mouth! It was absolutely divine. Next, our waiter brought us a basket of pita bread with their homemade carrot butter, compliments of the chef, and I have never tasted such fresh pita in my life. The carrot butter was very smooth and silky in texture. I opted for the Kaleidoscope Pasta, penne with a tomato based cream sauce containing onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, roasted corn, and peas. It was a very unique approach to a  pasta dish, colorful in appearance, largely portioned, and reasonably priced. 

This is a place I would return to for several reasons: the staff were very nice, professional and attentive, the bottle fee was cheap, the food tasted good and was reasonably priced, and  the building and decorations were unlike any other place I have been. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite tight on space, but they made good use of the space they have. If you plan on coming with a larger party, do rsvp in advance to ensure you don't have to wait. The menu is limited, but well thought out. The service was phenomenal! They treated us so well and were super patient with us even when we had complicated requests. 

As for food, I had the chance to try the crab dip with pita bread, and the gnocchi nirvana. The crab dip was tasty enough, but the texture was a bit too runny. The gnocchi nirvana was smaller than I expected. For an entrée, it was the size of an appetizer. The gnocchi was super tasty though with a hint of Indian spices. Other than the teeny weeny portion, I really enjoyed the gnocchi. The chef even threw in a complimentary plate of pita bread and some sort of exotic butter. Freebies are always a plus in my book!  

Overall I had a great dining experience at Kaleidoscope. I will definitely return here again and highly recommend this little charm! Amazing service and well-prepared food!"}
{"text":"Delish food and great staff!  They let ud order off the lunch menu at dinner time since we were interested in the pulled pork sandwich :)"}
{"text":"Okay, but nothing spectacular.  Went for a late lunch on a Saturday, and the place was completely deserted (not at 3 p.m. or anything - this was at 1:30).  Just had a light lunch, and my girlfriend and I both opted for the Greek salad.  It was very good, but I can't really comment on the \"real\" food.  Service was friendly.  Biggest ding was the space - corners have been cut there, certainly not up to snuff for the price point they're at.  (Location's weird, too.)  I wouldn't avoid it for a second try, but I won't be seeking it out, either."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great atmosphere, delicious, creative, thoughtful food.  I loved everything about Kaleidoscope Cafe!!

I went to Kaleidoscope with my book club of about 10 women.  The cafe has eclectic decor and not sure there is a sign outside, but the entire building is brightly colored like a kaleidoscope.  Parking is easy around this area of Lville, sort of back in the cut a little away from busy Butler St.  

I ordered the Autumn Harvest Salad (very good, especially the crunchy soybeans) and the Gnocchi Nirvana (after reading so many rave reviews on Yelp!)  Well, Yelpers, you definitely did not let me down, the Gnocchi was outstanding.  The Indian-spiced sauce was very pleasant and not overwhelmingly flavored at all.  The gnocchi was so delicious that I quickly ate it all, so I'm not sure if I just woofed down my dinner or if the portion was a little small.  Probably a bit of both.  I could definitely have seen getting a bit more for the price.  For this reason I would recommend always getting a salad or app with your entree!  OR better yet, dessert.  Lucky me, I did both salad and dessert.  

The poached pear dessert was just outstanding.  The flavors reminded me of Christmas, clovey, cinnamon, red wine, all with a glob of mascarpone quenelle, which basically reminded me of whipped cream cheese (only more delicious).  Surrounding the pretty burgundy pear and quenelle were several candied walnuts that brought a pleasing crunch to the dish.  

All around the food was balanced, flavorful, and interesting.  I will definitely be going back, and Kaleidoscope Cafe may just be my new favorite place to Lville!  BYOB to boot!"}
{"text":"A five star rating is rare for me, so when I took in the loud atmosphere, cheap decor (unmatched tables, random haphazard triangles stuck on the walls for adornment), and low staff (one waitress and one hostess for the entire place), I wasn't expecting much.

And then the food arrived, and my taste buds were in for a treat! Even right from the complimentary bread and butter (Pita and seasoned butter), the food was fantastic. Possibly the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh to date.

Our appetizers, the deep fried gnocchi was so light and airy that I couldn't believe it was made from potato. The duck cannoli served on a white chocolate sauce was moist and perfectly balanced. 

The entrees kept up the extremely high level of flavor, the cow jumped over the blue moon featured a perfectly cooked steak atop a rich pasta sauce. Honestly, either of the two alone would have been a great entree, but combined the balance of flavors was irresistible. My wife had the cornish game hen, and let me tell you, it was absolutely the right choice. The bird was moist and delicious, served on top of light and airy mashed potatoes, with dried figs, tomatoes, and snow peas. 

For desert we tried the flourless chocolate cake and rosemary lemon torte. I must note that while they were very good, I recommend getting both and sharing, as the lemon is very refreshing and the chocolate very rich, so they compliment eachother well. 

I will definitely be going back. Any time I can make the excuse!"}
{"text":"Low key and delicious. It's byob which is awesome. Food was great, price was good. Would def go back. Don't expect much ambiance but it's cute."}
{"text":"I thought it was just OK, not sure if it was the ambiance or what. My Cow Jumped Over The Moon was pretty good, but for some reason the place didn't strike me as somewhere I'd personally frequent. Worth giving a shot, for sure (and bring a bottle of wine)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly a hidden gem, located on the back streets of Lawrenceville! When I have friends visiting from out of town, I always take them here.  They have good vegetarian options as the menu has hearty salads and meatless dishes including a basil marinara made in traditional Italian fashion by hand beating tomatoes and herbs into a luscious sauce. The burgers and seafood options are fantastic as well. I recently had the scallops and they were out of this world.  I highly recommend Kaleidoscope for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I just went to Kaleidoscope Cafe for my anniversary dinner. We went on a Wednesday evening and we were the first ones in the restaurant, which was a bit unsettling. It didn't last long and I got over it quickly, however, and proceeded to have an outstanding evening.

We started out with the Kaleidoscope Salad and Apple Chicken Sausage Saute. The salad was very good, the chicken sausage dish was definitely our favorite. It was a great blend of sweet brie and fruit with savory sausage, I highly recommend it as the appetizer. We also received complementary warm pita bread and pineapple/rum/brown sugar butter, which was tasty.

We ordered the gnocchi and the salmon for our main courses, and both were excellent. The salmon was flavorful on a yummy risotto and the gnocchi was light and fluffy in a savory Indian sauce. We skipped dessert because we were pretty stuffed from all of the food and the bottle of wine we brought to share.

Since Kaleidoscope is BYOB, our total bill was just over $60, which is a fantastic price for the quality and quantity of our respective meals. It is definitely worth the \"off the beaten path\" location to get this much flavor per dollar without sacrificing portion size or service.

There is not much room and the interior decorations are not nearly as cool as the exterior, so make reservations and go with a bit of an open mind. But whatever you do, don't miss it!"}
{"text":"If you plan to go get some food in Lawrenceville at any other place besides Kaleidoscope, don't! Kaleidoscope is the place to go. It's hidden a few streets down from Butler and is such a gem. They offer generous portions for reasonable prices. The staff is welcoming and wonderful. Definitely one of my favorite places!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat here. The staff is friendly, the chef is excellent.

It is intimate spacing, don't bring a huge party. Parking is also an issue.

I have been here 4 times and have never been disappointed in my meal."}
{"text":"I'm really late on this review, but my experience here was so good that I just had to Yelp about it!  (I also apologize in advance for the inevitable lengthy review about to be born...) 

After hearing good things about Kaleidoscope Cafe, I was finally able to dine here with my family and was blown away!  There was 4 of us and we went on a Friday night around 7-8ish.  The inside is so cute, decorated with paintings and artwork from local artists.  Each table has a unique painting on it - all were very cool.  There was a small crowd for a Friday night, but the restaurant is actually spacious inside and there was no wait.  

Anyways, onto the food... we each ordered a different salad and a different small plate with the intentions of sharing everything, because everything looked good on the menu.  All the salads were very fresh and equally delicious.  Of the small plates, I think the fried gnocchis were my favorite, although I'm a little biased as gnocchi is one of my favorite foods, but really, I remember loving every plate.  The chicken sausage and duck cannoli were cooked to perfection and served beautifully.  

After dinner, even though we were pretty stuffed, we decided to follow our momentum and try all three desserts.  Again, completely overwhelmed with how good these were!  The chef actually came out to talk to us during dessert, because he thought we were food critics (since we basically ordered half the menu between the 4 of us,) haha.  He said the poached pear is his specialty dessert and I will admit, it was delicious and served in a gourmet fashion - as all his dishes were.  

The only complaint I would have is that our meal did take a long time.  (I'm  guessing because the chef/owner literally makes everything, which is awesome!)  We were not starving when we got there and had plenty of Cider from Arsenal Cider House to keep us occupied that the slowness wasn't an issue for us, but it is something I'd keep in mind before visiting.  

If you haven't been to Kaleidoscope Cafe, I highly reccomment you do yourself a favor and get there!  The chef/owner was so friendly and down to earth.  You could tell and see through his food how passionate he is about his Cafe.  I'm already thinking about when/how I can go back here!"}
{"text":"Honestly I probably would have walked right by this hidden little gem had my daughter not heard good things. It's nothing fancy to look at but the food is amazing. Service was outstanding. There were seven of us and we all got meals plus three appetizers ( small plates ) and two desserts and it came out to about $25 per person. Great food great prices. Definite winner."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight for the first time because it was one of very few restaurants that seat after 9:30pm in Lawrenceville. The meal was excellent from start to finish.  We enjoyed a delicious chickpea curry cream of mushroom soup to start.  It was followed by yummy pita bread with cranberry orange butter, compliments of the chef.  I ordered the Gnocchi Nirvana which was a fusion Italian Indian dish.  Absolutely delicious and a welcome meal on a cold winter night.  My husband ordered the Cornish Hen which he enjoyed very much.  We finished with the flourless chocolate torte which was an amazing finish to a fantastic meal.  Can't wait to dine here again!!"}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope Cafe is another strong addition to the Lawrenceville dining scene.  It's off the main Butler st strip in this converted house located on a quiet unassuming corner, so don't be alarmed like I was when I arrived.  This restaurant offers semi-upscale dining in a casual environment.  The menu selection is quite unique.

We started off our meal with deep fried gnocci which crisp and satisfying.  Despite the fact that it was deep fried, it was cooked and presented in such that you wouldn't think it was in fact deep fried.  For the main meal I enjoyed vegetable polenta which was freshly prepared and appropriately seasoned.  The serving size was enough to leave you satisfied, but don't go expecting to take food home unless your appetite is really that miniscule.  The meal was capped off with poached pear, a desert that actually spices some spice!  Very tasty.

The service was good, and do note BYOB for those of you interested in that.  We were greeted by the chef towards the end of the meal, which was certainly a nice touch.  Why 4 stars instead of 5?  Fancy pants food in a cafe like setting was kind of an odd experience for me.  Maybe you'd beg to differ?"}
{"text":"When I was a little wee-Yelper my mother owned a solid brass kaleidoscope...that I wasn't allowed to play with.  Such a tragedy.  So, imagine my excitement when, upon arrival at Kaleidoscope Café, I discovered kaleidoscopes on each table.  Alas, they too were just for decoration and completely non-functional.  Sad.   The good news is, the delicious food and welcoming service at this Lawrenceville hideaway soon turned my frown upside down.  I found the menu to be diverse and unique, and I would absolutely order everything on it.  Both my guest and myself elected to start this particular meal with the carrot ginger soup.  SO delicious and nicely complemented by a basket of warm pita with fruit-laced butter.  I would roll around in this butter, it was that good.  

Following the hearty helping of soup and pita, I moved on to the Autumn Harvest salad; a bed of spring greens topped with cranberries, apples, cheese and butternut squash dressing.  It could've used a dash of spice or two and a bigger plate (I move my lettuce around A LOT) but I was still quite satisfied.  My date ordered the gnocchi in some sort of curry sauce - a DELIGHTFUL combination that I will be trying at home should I ever have to urge to actually cook something not on the Foreman.  

Like many of my fellow-Yelpers, we were nearly alone in the restaurant, save for two other couples.  Go!  Eat!  Bring booze (BYOB)!  Be merry!

Oy. I really hate to do this, but I feel the need to update and make the change from 4 stars to 3, though were 2.5 stars an option, I'd take it.  Thank you, Kaleidoscope Cafe, for participating in Pittsburgh Restaurant Week.  It gave me a chance to showcase this L'ville gem to my manfriend and one of my lady friends this past Saturday.  Unfortunately, as I remember from my last visit, the place was solely staffed by one hostess/food-runner and one server (plus the excellent chef).  The food - delicious.  Really .  Kaleidoscope has a great food-quality thing going.  The service?  Pretty bad, unfortunately.  We waited 20 minutes for drink orders; then another few before said drinks were delivered.  My soda was flat, but I'll let that go.  (Yes, I was offered another can, but I had a feeling the story would be the same...tasted old/out-of-date, so I kindly declined.)  We received our food a solid 50 minutes in; and very few water refills in between.  We also waited another long period of time for our check and actually had to request the check twice.  Yes, we were given a warm basket of pita and pistachio butter, which was lovely.  And, as I mentioned, the food is wonderful.  But honestly, I can go any number of the other local great restaurants in the area, pay less, and receive much better service.  Sorry, but the pretty kaleidoscopes on the table just aren't worth it.  Sad panda."}
{"text":"Among the many new places popping up in the Lawrenceville area, Kaleidoscope lives up to it's name bringing a variety of different colorful dishes together for you to enjoy. 

This was my first time dining here, along with a couple coworkers. There was no one in the restaurant when we walked in for lunch, which immediately alarmed one of my friends. This was immediately put to rest when the owner himself came out to chat with us and tell us more about the menu. With many unique options to choose from, we eventually decided to share the following:

Farmhouse Salad
Kaleidoscope Salad
Broccoli Cheddar Soup of the day
Sauté of Chicken Apple Sausage 
Sweet Potato Hush Puppies with chili aioli 
Slow-Roasted Pulled Sandwich - Both Duck & Pork with fries

Everything was very good, but the Chicken Apple Sausage and hush puppies were especially tasty and unique. 

Prices were more than fair, serving sizes were plentiful and service was very attentive and friendly.

I hope this place is able to survive with all the new restaurants to choose from in the revitalized area. It deserves a visit from any foodie wanting to share and sample some it's goodies on the menu. Bring some of your friends and just enjoy the colorful  corner cafe and it's cuisine."}
{"text":"I gave 5 stars based on the food alone. I would give the service 4 stars.

I called about 4 days in advance to make reservations for my birthday lunch with 5 of my girlfriends for 3pm on a Saturday.  I was told over the phone before the guy hung up \"parking is on the side of the building and we prefer cash.\"  Kind of weird IMO about the cash thing but I knew from reading previous reviews. The day of the reservation I called a few hours prior to see if I could add 2 more to the table,  I was told \"umm, yeah we should be able to do that.\"  When we showed up at 3pm, there was not a single person in the restaurant, which was good because 8 girlfriends who haven't seen each other in a while sharing 8 bottles of wine can get a little rowdy.  Our waitress was friendly and patient and took good care of us.  Between the group, we had the tuna gyro, fresh cut fries, chicken sandwich w/ awesome sauce, fried gnocchi, Mediterranean salad, scallop pasta and the soup of the day (a broth based bean and sausage soup) and every single one of us licked our plates clean.  The food at this place is EXCELLENT.  It would be a fun little spot to go on a date and it was perfect for a late lunch for my group.  

After lunch was winding down, the head chef came out to see how everything tasted.  He was extremely friendly and personable and stayed for a minute to talk to us about his previous restaurants, the menu and his wife,  All in all - a good experience. I would suggest reservations if you think of it, though, because I can see it getting bit tight and crowded at more peak times."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is worth venturing through the backstreets to find. It's a few blocks from the main hub on Butler... I started to think I'd gone too far, and then I saw the bright, swirling patterns that adorn the exterior of this lovely cafe.
The staff was small but knowledgeable. The only waiter there when I went was chatty and humorous, a really nice guy. I should have remembered his name, but I'm terrible.
I looked over the menu, and everything sounded great (Duck Cannoli, Fried Gnocchi...) However, this particular day I was craving a good salad.
After some deliberation, I decided on the Warm Brussel Sprout Salad, with the add-on option of grilled chicken. The sprouts were shredded into a kind of slaw... I'd never had them like that before, and it was fantastic. The salty pops of crispy prosciutto was an excellent touch as well.
I paired it with Orange Spice tea, which made for a lovely meal. 
Service was fast, friendly, and altogether just pleasant. Decor is unique and almost idyllic. I absolutely recommend Kaleidoscope Cafe for when you're in the mood for a relaxing dining experience!"}
{"text":"Came here once I saw the hype regarding this place and decided to check it out.
I ended up getting the Scallops Beurre Noisette & the Duck Cannoli.

Scallops Beurre Noisette

Pros - the scallops ... freshly cooked and had wonderful flavor. I could tell from one bite that they were authentic and from the way they were cooked, done so to retain maximum flavor and juice.

Cons - the pasta was only just average ... not so sure if I'm a fan of it literally being doused head to toe in oil. taking just one look at the pasta itself told me as much.

Duck Cannoli

Pros - the duck meat was fantastic. ended up being really juicy and full of flavor, not dry and bland.

the cannoli shell and general appearance - made it quite appetizing and pleasing to the eye

Cons - the white chocolate cardamom burre-blanc ... or maybe the lack thereof? didn't really taste any of that when I ate the dish. hmm ...

At any rate, I found this generally to be a good place for dinner. The interior could be a little brighter, but other than that, it was good. worth a try"}
{"text":"Finally able to make it around to this hidden away gem in Lawrenceville. While there is a plethora of good restaurants on Butler street itself, if you actually hipster out of leave the beaten path down 43rd street you come across this inconspicuous, yet mural painted food spot.

I came here on a Wednesday after running a ton of errants and with a good friend who I will miss after he moves to London. [you will be missed greatly] As we have  a habit of making good of BYOB spots we scraped up a bottle of bubbly made our way down. The hostess [who was also our waitress] sat us at a two seater in the corner and gave us the specials and asked for our drink preferences. With brunch in mind we ordered a tall glass of orange juice and promptly we had ourselves mimosas. 

The menu is set up a little oddly put together, well at least we found have rearranged some sections, however no matter what the setup, our eyes were bouncing all over the place. We had no idea where to start.

For our appetizer we ordered the deep fried gnocchi, served with a side of home marinara sauce. This appetizer is a great, light version of typical mozzarella sticks, but the gnocchi will melt in your mouth. The portion is quite small and there is plenty of sauce of go along with it. The marinara [must be mentioned] is excellent. Very tomato, a tad natural sweet and just so good. I could have eaten it  just on its own.

For an entree I finally decided on the Tuna Gyro, which was just absolutely excellent. The tuna was perfect and pink in the middle, which were splendidly tender. I was given a side of very green cucumber sauce which reminded me of green potion [but in a good way]

The waitress/hostess was continuously checking in on us making sure it was all alright. The slight thing to mention is that she didn't quite understand what we intended with the orange juice, so she served it like a regular glass which was difficult to pour into the wine glasses to make mimosas. 
Cam had the Chicken Breast Sandwich, for which the highlight was the awesome sauce [which was a style of 1000 island]. Good things were report for the sandwich.

Great little hideaway spot, you didn't end up over full at the end of the meal and I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"My friend had been harassing me to come here for the longest! My reason for taking so long to go was because I looked at the menu several times and didn't see anything that jumped at me. So finally I gave in and decided to go. I was excited to try the smoked jalapeño corn custard. I was extremely disappointed. I definitely gave this meal a chance. The polenta like aspect was ok at first then underneath was the custard. I should've known better but that corn custard was not good at all. It looked like eggs under the top layer. I ate everything but the corn custard. I would not get this again."}
{"text":"Worth going off the beat and path for.  Went there for lunch.  I had the Farmhouse Salad.  All the ingredients were fresh and tasty.  I liked that I had a choice of having either a medium or large portion.  I opted to have a grilled portobello on top.  Pure heaven.   My boyfriend had the \"Go fish\" sandwich which was made with freshly broiled Basa.  Again, super fresh and tasty.  He had a side order of fries.  These were no ordinary fries.  They were freshly cut potatoes, done crispy and lightly salted.  Perfect.   

We were there at an odd time (between lunch and dinner) so there weren't many people there.  Service was great.  I would definitely go back and try one of the dinner entrees!   You should definitely check out this hidden jewel in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"This was an excellent little place. It is really low key, not crowded, I am guessing partly due to its location on the back streets of Lawrenceville. The decor is cool, creatively playing off of its name. The chef was kind enough to provide us these small pita bread pieces with a delicious sweet fig butter to get us started.

 My girlfriend and I both then had the \"Gnocchi Nirvana\" which is a deep fried Gnocchi with \"Soyrizo (vegetarian friendly!)\" and kafta (Indian sauce). Absolutely delicious. We got a dessert that was a tart with apple and walnut. I cannot emphasize in words how good this was. 

Bottomline is, I went here maybe a year ago and I was not very impressed. Significantly improved and I could see myself wanting to come back here again and again. It is always cool to find a quality restaurant without ridiculous crowds."}
{"text":"Another really good dinner. We shared the crab appetizer which is very tasty. Also shared the duck cannoli which was loaded with Duck and just a little sweetness. I had the cow jumped over the moon and my wife had the perch from the new summer menu. Both very enjoyable. The summer menu looks great but I still like the regular offerings so much. Really a nice restaurant. Byob very reasonable."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday the place was empty when we arrived which made me a bit nervous. The waitress was attentive and explained the menu and her favorites. We went with the fried gnocchi appetizer it was awesome!  Decided on salads for our entrees. We had the Farm House and Brussel Sprout both were excellent. They have medium and large. Medium would have been plenty. We will go back! By the time we left the place was filling up. I suspect on the weekends it would be a long wait."}
{"text":"If you can ignore the decor, the food is fantastic. I had wanted to try the Kaleidescope cafe since I discovered it during Pittsburgh restaurant week. We made reservations and met two dining companions on a friday night. Upon arrival, we were immediately taken aback by the size and decor. This restaurant is tiny. I'd say it maxes out at about 40 people. The inside looks a little dull and old except for the bright colored glass everywhere. Maybe it's just me but I don't really get the kaleidescope theme. It's an odd choice for a resturant in my opinion. 

We started our meals with the fried gnocchi and the crab dip appetizers. I wasn't overly impressed with the crab dip but the gnocchi were quite interesting. I enjoyed the smooth texture and slightly crunchy breading. For my main entree, I ordered the pork tenderloin but replaced the hash with the garlic mashed potatoes due to my love of anything with garlic in the name. The potatoes did not disappoint. They were smashed, slightly lumpy and rich with garlic, just how I like 'em. The pork loin was very tender, juice and cooked to the perfect temperature. My husband also thoroughly enjoyed his entree choice, the cow jumped over the blue moon which is a clever name for a fettuchine alfredo with gorgonzola and steak.  We then finished our meal with the new dessert, which was not listed on the menu but caught my ear when our server mentioned apples. This new dessert reminds me of an apple pastry. It was tasty but did not compare to the main entree. 

One issue I did have with my Kaleidescope cafe experience was the service. Our meals took forever! Largely due to a 20 top that must have been sat 15 minutes before us, it took almost 3 hours total for our meal! The waiter apologized and offered us free wine and extra pita bread with homemade butter but, that didn't help us much since we had a hard time finishing the 2 bottles we had brought ourselves. I can't help but wonder who thought it was a good idea to book reservations so close to seating a party that took up half the restaurant."}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope is slightly off the beaten path, but hard to miss (their facade is quite impressive) and definitely worth checking out. For a small restaurant, they have a decent sized menu with good variety. I had one of their salads, which was quite large and really tastey. Their main courses are a reasonable portion size without being too much food. I had the polenta dish, which had an exceptional tomato sauce. Everyone at my party was also very pleased with their food. My parents have since gone back another time, and equally enjoyed their second experience."}
{"text":"Had a lunch meeting here w/ my Pastor. Dan (the owner) is a friend of his & this was my 1st time eating here. I was impressed! I had the Chicken Breast sandwich which is a grilled chicken breast, served with bacon, avocado, tomato, cheddar cheese & something called  \"awesome\" sauce, which was really good on my fries. The sauce DEFINITELY lives up to it's name, but I have no idea what's in it & Dan keeps it TOP SECRET!!! I did ask for a sample of it to take home & have my hubby try to help me figure out the ingredients (I jokingly said I needed to \"get it to the lab\"). We're still stumped!!! Oh well, all the more reason to go BACK & get more! 
The food was great. Decor was interesting & really cool. From what Dan said, the tables are all different works of art done by local artists. Also, in keeping with the theme/name of the place, there are Kaleidoscopes on each table.  Looking forward to going back sometime soon! Since I went in the middle of a Friday afternoon, I'm not sure how busy it gets in the evening. But it was a great, quiet place to have good food & a quiet lunch meeting at the same time."}
{"text":"Yes, Dan is a great host, chef and I'm glad he decided to return to Pittsburgh! I meant to write this Yelp review awhile ago - and agree with Elizabeth M, in that I don't want it overrun and I can't get a table. 

On the contrary, I do want this place to stay open. We've been here twice and each time, it's delicious. I've had the deep fried gnocchi and it is delicious. I also had the pasta with peas and the fish. Again-- everything is wonderful. And our friends loved the place too. I look forward to seeing the place once he's redecorated, then it'll be even cozier. BYOB - keeps it totally reasonable. And the staff are very friendly. Can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! To start, we ordered the sweet potato hush puppies that left us wanting more.  I ordered the tuna gyro with low expectations, but received a perfect pita full of ahi tuna, lettuce, tomato, cucumber and spinach with awesome cucumber sauce to accompany. Great coffee, too!  I would recommend the kaleidoscope cafe to anyone in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"This cafe not only has good vibes but also the food was great! 

We found street parking right in front of the cafe and went in a few minutes after when they opened at 11am on Saturday. We were the only ones there for a good hour. The waitress was very attentive and super friendly. 

We shared the Duck Cannoli and Crab Dip. They were both delicious - the cannoli had a great crispy shell and the duck itself was tender and had great flavor; the crab dip came with a lot of pita triangles that were crispy but soft, and the dip itself was ADDICTIVE. By the time our main dishes came out, we were both really full. My friend got the Fried Gnocchi and I got the Cow Jumped Over the Blue Moon pasta. They were both great, but since we were so full we took them to go. 

We both enjoyed the food and atmosphere, and I would go back to try something else! A perfect place to visit for a hearty meal."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Lawrenceville! This little cafe has adventurous culinary creations, great service, and is reasonably priced.

I came here on a sunny weekend afternoon upon seeing their (amazing) logo a few times on Butler Street. My beau and I were the only ones in the cafe at the time and were made to feel extremely welcome (which I can't say for all empty establishments unfortunately). I ordered the fried gnocchi which arrived in an Indian-inspired tomato chutney sauce with cashews. Delicious! I greatly appreciated the creativity in presenting gnocchi, a classic Italian pasta, with a traditionally Indian sauce. Not to mention, it didn't suffer from the typical problem gnocchi tends to have: being WAY too dense and soggy. On the contrary, it was fairly light (considering the fact that it was fried) and not too heavy.

As a vegetarian, I was originally concerned about the lack of veg options on the menu but was told almost anything on the menu could be made vegetarian. Perhaps in another non-vegetarian life, I'll get the duck cannoli with white chocolate!

(Also, Dan, the chef/owner is extremely personable and accommodating! Great service.)"}
{"text":"Finally got to go here on Friday - have been looking forward to trying this place for some time. I'm glad I went - it was fabulous! We love BYOB places and have been working our way through pretty much all of them in Pittsburgh and this was on the tour list for sure!  While the atmosphere is a little subdued (despite the simulated kaleidoscope pieces on the walls), it was cozy enough and we lingered before and after dinner to make sure we didn't take half empty wine bottles home. 

The Kaleidoscope salad was delightful and a good starter. Soup of the day was tomato romano which was deep with flavor and a wonderful nutty note of aged romano cheese. I could have eaten a gallon of it! We ordered the gnocchi nirvana to share as an appetizer and let me just say this - everything people write about this is true. WOW! It is FABULOUS!! Soft, like melted marshmallows, hands down the best gnocchi I've ever had! It melts BEFORE it gets to your mouth - and the flavors are amazing. Do yourself a favor - order this!

I got the Cow jumped over the moon - the beef was super tender and the fettuccini was cooked perfectly. The gorgonzola cream sauce was intense without being overpowering. Filled with flavor, this is a dish I'd get again - but only after I worked my way through some of the other entrees. My wife got the scallops buerre noisette - perfectly cooked jumbo scallops in an amazing brown butter sauce. All so fresh and a good size portion. Yum indeed. 

Service was top notch and attentive. The menu is somewhat limited but there is enough there to satisfy most everyone's palate. Well worth your time to check out!"}
{"text":"I was very surprised when we got to lunch on a Saturday afternoon and the place was empty and after we ate, I was even more surprised!  It's a bit  off the main drag, but worth it!  The deep fried gnocchi was yum yum yummy!  The gnocchi was smooth in the center and crisp on the outside with a tomato dipping sauce.  Great starter!  I had a salad, and the large is enough for a meal!  It was a great salad with walnuts and blue cheese!  Really great!  My fiance had eyes like saucers when he sauce a pulled duck sandwich.  He ate it in about 5 seconds, so he must have liked it!?!  The atmosphere is really great, lots of fun art on the table tops and hanging on the walls.  It was a great lunch spot!  Oh yeah, it's BYOB."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time last night as part of a group party.  A friend of mine maintains a food blog, and they do a monthly wine exchange at local BYOB restaurants.  Last night's exchange was at Kaleidoscope, and we had a truly great time.

Since it was a closed party, they served us 'family style' from big plates that we passed around between our group tables.  We started with a salad with a homemade dressing, and warm pita bread with a heavenly pine nut butter spread.

The side dish was herb baked polenta with winter vegetable ragu.  I haven't ever had polenta before, and it was really good, kind of somewhere between corn bread and baked potato consistency.  The 'winter vegetables' were like a warm salsa topping the polenta.

For dinner, we had two entrees.  The first was a pork loin roasted with habernero apple compote.  This was amazing - I have had pork with fruit several times recently (the last was with pear), and I cannot say enough good things about this combination.   The pork was tender and juicy.

The second entree was beef with 'cow jumped over the blue moon' pasta.  The pasta was fettuccine, but smelled and tasted just like homecooked pierogies in butter and onions.  I made the waiter take my plate after my first serving, because I was afraid I would just go back for more and more.  The beef was so juicy and melt-in-your-mouth good.

We also got the chocolate cake dessert, which was awesome.  The other option was a baked pear dessert, and I wish we had been able to get both.  Everything was just delicious.

Kaleidoscope is BYOB, which I also love.  It's nestled a few streets back from the bustle of Butler Street, and is hard to miss if you aren't looking for it.  We are certainly glad to have discovered it, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing about my experience here was either mediocre or bad... And the food and service far exceeded my expectations. That's always a good thing.  

Kaleidoscope is tucked away not on the main drag in Lawrenceville, so it can be easy to miss. It's an interesting little BYOB establishment... Upon entering, we didn't know what to expect.  We've been back several times now bc both the service and food were awesome (and each visit was consistent with the others).  I have had a number of items, some of which include the scallops, a gnocchi dish, and the kaleidoscope salad... I would recommend all of the above. 

If you haven't been here, you must give it a shot! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super good food at reasonable prices. I had the chicken apple sausage appetizer (plus complimentary pita and apple butter) and the pulled pork with buckwheat pancakes. The pork was some of the best I've ever had. The chef came out and spoke with us. Really down to earth place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is wonderful. The food is fresh and savory. Portion sizes are filling. The atmosphere is quite interesting. If you don't enjoy your company, you can simply be stimulated by your surroundings. This restaurant is BYOB so make sure you bring your favorite bottle of wine. I highly recommend this venue."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. You have to try the poached pear for dessert. It's a little slow so don't come if your in a big hurry. I think it's a pretty small kitchen. But if you have the time to hang out and really enjoy your food this place rocks. We weren't disappointed at all and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's off the beaten path in Lawrenceville and it's not a large space but the food is always excellent!

My absolute favorite dish on the menu is the \"cow jumped over the blue moon\" pasta. Gorgonzola cream sauce sauce, sweet onion confit, steak, and almonds to garnish. This dish is sinful and something I often crave. 

We also love the fried gnocchi small plate. I'm not a fan of traditional gnocchi; I find it too dense, but this dish is very light and fluffy. Oh, and the marinara that comes with the gnocchi is perfect!

During our most recent visit, my husband ordered the curry polenta and raved about it. He's also enjoyed the gnocchi nirvana and some of the fish specials. 

Kaleidoscope is BYOB and accepts reservations.  It's important to mention that the food is made to order so there will be a little bit of a wait. The chef usually sends out pitas with a unique butter while you wait.  The dining space is a bit small, only fitting about 10 tables, but the overall atmosphere is unique and features local artwork on the tables.  

This should definitely be on your list of places to try - we are never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ever since I first found Kaleidoscope Cafe two years ago when I was looking for dinner in Lawrenceville and they couldn't seat me, I've been wanting to come back and try it out.  When I saw that they were participating in PGH Restaurant Week, I made a reservation for Fri. evening at 6:30 for CM and I to ensure that this time, I'd be able to try their unique culinary offerings.  

Because of the PGH Restaurant Week promotion, CM and I ordered more than we usually would, so we were able to try a good portion of the menu.  We ordered the following: Deep-fried gnocchi (shared), Kaleidoscope salad (CM), autumn harvest salad (me), miso glazed salmon with risotto (CM), chicken cherry pot pie (me), and flourless chocolate torte (shared).  Additionally, the chef included a complimentary serving of pita bread with pineapple-mango (?) infused butter.

In general, I was quite impressed with the flavors and quality of the dishes that we ordered.  The deep-fried gnocchi was quite unique, and the marinara sauce that accompanied it was tasty--Darren W.'s description of this dish is very apt.  The bright, citrusy notes of the butter made for a wonderful accompaniment to the pita bread, with a mouthwatering sweet-salty balance.  The salads both had a nice variety of flavors and textures, and were quite fresh and pleasant.  Unfortunately, the Kaleidoscope salad was missing avocado due to a kitchen shortage, so it wasn't as texturally balanced as it would have been, even though CM subbed in walnuts.  Although a bit small, the flourless chocolate torte was rich, smooth, and creamy, and was one of the best renditions I've tasted.

For my entree, I was originally planning to order the sweet potato tagliatelle per another Yelper's recommendation, but the chicken cherry pot pie also captured my interest, so I asked my waitress which dish she'd recommend. Without hesitation, she recommended the pot pie, so I decided to order it instead. In terms of diameter, this was the largest chicken pot pie I've ever eaten at about 10,\" and it was quite tall as well, due to a light-as-air puff pastry top. While it was delicious and unique, the overall flavor turned out to be a bit sweeter than I'd have liked due to the cherries in the filling.  CM's salmon, on the other hand, had a great balance of savory flavors and textures, and was more to my taste.

Aside from the food, service was on point, with dishes being served and cleared at a perfect pace, and attentiveness to our needs.  The one disappointment was that the chef didn't come out to greet us--it's my understanding that he usually does this, and I saw him do it for the next table over as we were waiting for our entrees, so perhaps he was too busy (?).  I really enjoyed the decor and the intimate setting, as well.

Overall, despite a few small hiccups, CM and I had a wonderful dinner at Kaleidoscope, and enjoyed sampling the menu.  Our check came to $63, which I felt was very reasonable, given the amount of food that we received. I'd highly recommend Kaleidoscope to anyone looking for a cozy, intimate, and delicious dinner in L-ville, especially for dates. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I don't think I've been to any place like this. Feels very creative and artistic, with little felt decorations on the walls as well as actual kaleidoscopes on some of the tables. It's a nice testament to Pittsburgh's growing artist scene. The food itself is great as well--tried the pulled duck sandwich and it was pretty fantastic. Also had the fried gnocchi, and it was definitely light and fluffy as opposed to greasy and gross. Some of the pastas look really good as well, which I look forward to trying next time. It also helps that the waitress was super friendly and nice."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in ages!
We started with some sort of special butter that had figs or dates in it with pita and it was the yummiest thing you can imagine. I could have eaten it with a spoon.

Then I had a Romano tomato soup that was amazing. You could really taste three different distinct flavors from the tomatoes, cheese, and basil. 

For an entree, I had the polenta with portobellos and winter vegetables. This was my first polenta experience so I have nothing to compare it to but it was like a dense cornbread.  Nice dish on a cold wintery day and very filling.

Finally, we shared a piece of the flourless chocolate cake courtesy of the owner and chef. It was so incredibly rich that I don't think I could have eaten a whole piece by myself.

My dining partners had the Cow Jumped Over the Moon pasta and the Basa fish and were very happy. They're usually pretty hard to please."}
{"text":"I went here in 2011. This place is so good. I love the gnocchi and the cow jumped over the blue moon which is pasta with steak and gorgonzola sauce."}
{"text":"Nothing negative to say about this place!  My Cow Jumped Over the Blue Moon was to die for! The cheese sauce was creamy and tart. The beef tender and cooked to perfection. EVERYTHING was cooked to perfection!  The chef even made an appearance to get feedback on the dishes. The menu may not have a huge selection, but it is still hard to choose which entree to try.  The creative kaleidoscope makes me think of the clientele this place seems to have. Colorful and full of life!"}
{"text":"While the whole experience was good, it wasn't great.  From the descriptions on the menu and the artsy-funk decor, I guess I was expecting some more pizazz.   We didn't get it in the food.  It seems like Kaleidoscope is going for homey and familiar, but missing the mark a bit.  I can see how this is a good place to have lunch delivered at work, but other than that, I wouldn't make a night out of it."}
{"text":"I have been living in Lawrenceville for the past 3 years and have never had a chance to try this place until yesterday. This place is BYOB and the inside decorations were very interesting. We got seated right away. The overall service was very good. Our server let my husband order a burger off of the lunch menu we saw online (that wasn't on the dinner menu) and they were quick to refill our water.

The food itself there was the biggest disappointment of the night. We went with friends and shared the crab dip and the gnocchi. I've had good crab dip in my life, and unfortunately this was not it. It tasted more like veggie/cream cheese dip with no distinctive crab flavor. I've had more flavorful crab dip from a jar from costco unfortunately. The gnocchi were not quite fried. They were mostly mushy and flavorless. No real seasoning on them and seemed to come from a big frozen bag. For entrees I got the house salad with chicken. The salad itself was very good with a very tasty balsamic dressing. The chicken on the salad, however had an unappealing texture and I didn't eat more than a few bites of the chicken itself. My husband's burger was overcooked (he ordered medium) but when they messed up by not putting avocado on the burger, they brought it out free of charge (good service). Fries with burger were pretty good and not overly greasy. 

Overall it was a fine dining experience but I would probably pick another BYOB place in the area if I wanted to eat at the place and not just drink."}
{"text":"Up until now, I had only tried the sandwich/burger selections at Kaleidoscope. Today, I had the Gnocchi Nirvana. Typical gnocchi dishes are heavy and can potentially stay with you for the rest of the day. Not the case with this dish. The Chef stopped by to ask how we were enjoying our lunch. When questioned about the gnocchi, he intimated that they make it fresh on site, and they deep fry it. The result is the lightest, airiest balls of pasta I have ever eaten. The kafta was a nice departure from the traditional tomato sauce and the chorizo brought the right touch of salty heat. Honestly though, the star of the dish were the gnocchi, which were so light they practically melted in your mouth like a pasta version of cotton candy."}
{"text":"just not very good or fresh.. I tried it twice thinking I must be missing something because of the good reviews.  food is bland, lettuce wilted, dining room not very tidy. too many good places to go in the area to bother with it again."}
{"text":"This place was delicious, and the service was excellent. The crab dip with bacon was quite tasty. The basa with lobster bean puree and greens with bacon was absolutely incredible. The portion of fish was HUGE and perfectly cooked. We weren't a huge fan of the fried gnocchi entree (with an Indian spiced tomato sauce) because the gnocchi weren't at all crispy. The chef came out at the end and asked our feedback on the entire meal. He was a very personable guy and it was apparent that he truly appreciates customer feedback. Kaleidoscope is BYOB w/ a $2.50/stem corkage fee. It was great - check it out before it gets so busy that you can't get in!"}
{"text":"Solid. Solid food options. Customer service is fantastic. It's something once thought was overrated but when people really go out of their way to make your eating experience good, well that stands out.  The creative food options are just the icing on the cake for this spot.  It's off the beaten path but so worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Short but sweet review: easy to find on the corner of 43rd in the Lawrenceville section of the city...and the only light colored brick building with funky art all over it. Quaint, and relaxed interior with each table top being created by different local artists (yay for supporting local!!). But, the important part: the food. As a longtime vegetarian (albeit recently eating phish and chicken...sshhh...don't tell PETA), I always dig anywhere I can eat that offers more than a boring iceberg lettuce side salad. So big props to Dan and crew at Kaleidoscope Cafe for offering several diverse salads, that can be a meal in themselves. I got the Farmhouse salad...it has beets in it. I don't eat beets. Ever. But the way they are prepared and incorporated into this salad is ridiculously yummy. So much so, that I would eat it again. There are options for meat eaters, veggie, and some things that could be made vegan. I also had a veggie stacker sandwich, with portobello and roasted red peppers. Again, my tummy smiled. My boyfriend had a chicken sandwich of some sort with avocado and bacon on it. He barely spoke while eating it as he was so engulfed by flavory goodness-to quote, he says 'it was really good.' price for lunch with appetizer, salad, and two meals was average, but supporting local artists and independent businesses is priceless. Go eat here and play with kaleidoscopes while u wait for your food. To-go orders, too. Your taste buds will dance :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Kaleidoscope Cafe on a Saturday night. The restaurant is BYOB, which we really enjoy. We were seated as soon as we walked in and the service was great throughout our meal. We started with sweet potato hush puppies that were delicious, my husband had the filet and I had the shepherd's pie. Both were delicious! My husband even made the comment that it was one of the better filets he has had in Pittsburgh. The waiter told us the chef hand picks the meat he is going to serve. Overall we had a wonderful dining experience!"}
{"text":"I've been here a half dozen times. The food is great and the people genuinely enjoy their jobs. Always a pleasure."}
{"text":"Disappointed overall, this place isn't how I remembered it any longer. Server was combatitive and kind of snippy, and seemed offended that we dared ask about the grilled cheese specials (that were e-mailed to one of our party, who's on their mailing list) AND that I asked about the cannoli that I remembered from a couple years ago that, at the time was so awesome that I STILL remember it to this day. Food quality was okay but not enough to overcome the bad service or justify the prices. I talked this place up pretty big to someone who'd never been there and he seemed utterly confused (and irritated) after our meal. Don't think I'll be going back. Sad that my fond memories of this place are now just a thing of the past."}
{"text":"I ate here this past Friday night with my girlfriend and two other dining companions for dinner.  As we headed there I was surprised how far off Butler Street it was located as I was unsure we were headed in the right direction until we ran into it a couple of blocks away.  The inside was cozy with seating for about 40 with kaleidoscopes on each table (sadly they didn't spin) as well as some reliefs made of glass sitting in the windows that reminded me of looking through a kaleidoscope.  We had reservations for 7:30 and got there around that time and were seated immediately.   However, after we were seated it took quite a while for us to get waited on but that was because there was a 20-top sitting right behind us that had come in before us.  I would guess that the place is normally has a reasonable volume level but due to them it was quite loud.

Our group decided to start off the evening with a couple of appetizers to split: the deep fried gnocchi as well as the crab dip.  The deep fried gnocchi was served with a side of marinara sauce for dipping but ended up being a little bit of a disappointment for me as I was looking forward to it after having read how good it was.  It seemed to be covered in a breadcrumb like substance on the outside that was a little bit more firm than the gnocchi but I did not really get the sense of them having been fried.  The crab dip tasted nicely and was served with an ample amount of warm pita to eat it all which was nice.    In addition to all of that I decided to have a cup of the soup of the day which was an apple mushroom soup.  It came out looking like your normal cream of mushroom soup, white and nondescript.   The taste of it was amazing though even though the apple was lost on me as there seemed to be a strong cheese (Romano?) flavor that came through with the earthiness of the mushrooms.  After we finished our appetizers, we had a pretty long wait for our dinners due to the 20-top.  It was long enough that the waiter came over and apologized to us numerous times bringing us complimentary warm pita and house made butter the first time and a complimentary bottle of wine and some more pita the second time.   For my dinner entrée I went with the cow jumped over the blue moon pasta.  It was named appropriately as it was beef over top of a fettuccine pasta with a Gorgonzola cream  sauce.  The beef was cooked nicely and paired well with the delicious and savory Gorgonzola sauce which left me satisfied with our wait for the meal.  Finally for dessert my girlfriend and I decided to split the rosemary shortbread tart.  It had a wonderful tasting rosemary flavored crust underneath a custard top with a little bit of blueberry? syrup on top.  Even though I was fairly full before we ordered it, I gladly helped to finish it off since it was very tasty.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  I enjoyed almost everything about the place from the kaleidoscope décor on the inside to the food and even the fact that it was BYOB.  Hopefully the next time that I go there will not be such a large party which I would hope would make the service quicker."}
{"text":"Bad atmosphere! The food was actually pretty good, but I would never go back because the atmosphere is absolutely terrible. The dining room is super small, flooring is tile that looks like bathroom tile, walls are green and blue, which makes the place seem even more claustrophobic (and they are dirty, very scuffed etc.), the walls have what looks like a children's art project gone bad covering them...tons of triangles covered in different fabric arranged on the walls, the tables are old and dank, the lighting is bad, its very dark, but not \"mood\" lighting, just depressing dark. The place is SOOOO loud. I don't necessarily mind a loud place if its \"happening\" type of roar or music, but this is just loud like a busy cafeteria. I'm just saying all this so that you are aware of what you are walking into...if you are going to relax DO NOT GO HERE. Also its BYOB, which I don't like...I like a place with a nice drink menu, but that is just my preference.

The food was very good. I had filet, which was cooked perfect, bf had a very nice pork chop. Sides were all homemade and super yummy. I wanted to try a dessert but I couldn't bear one more minute in this atmosphere. The service was great, one waitress for 32 people, and she was on point. 

I think this place works for a younger crowd, 20 somethings who aren't too in tune with their surroundings, but if you are over 30 it will annoy you to no end. Although the food is good, it just isn't worth being trapped in a tiny dark loud room."}
{"text":"My wife and I went looking for a reasonable BYOB place in Pittsburgh and found our way here on a late Saturday afternoon. Their menu looked enticing and reasonable; It is a bit off the main path and has a very unique hipster look and feel to it. 

The staff was very friendly upon arrival and the waiter was bringing us another beer from our six pack every time we had finished one.  They make their own fried gnocchi which I would HIGHLY recommend!  Eating an earlier dinner, my wife and I each ordered pasta to help fill us up for the night.  I had the \"Cow Jumped Over the Moon\" and my wife ordered the Kaleidoscope.  Mine was for sure weird and different (sweet onion config, gorgonzola alfredo, and sliced beef), but somehow all the flavors worked together really well and its something you won't find anywhere else.  My wife loved hers which was a really clever combination of mushroom, bacon, onion, tomatoes, and corn over penne.

The BYOB here is a great deal if you're not looking to spend much on drinks with dinner.  If you're adventurous in trying something different, make your way to Kaleidoscope.  They have some awesome flavors, friendly wait staff, and a decent deal close to the city."}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I went back for my birthday last week, and the food and service were wonderful. We shared the pumpkin curry soup and sweet potato hush puppies, and for entrees we had the scallops and the shepherd pie. Everything was delicious, and we had enough to qualify for the weeknight free bottle of wine special. Our server was very nice and attentive, and we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Adorable little artsy cafe with a lot of charm and potential! Let me knock out a list of a few kinks I feel should be worked out first before delving into the food:

1. The entrance is on the side of the building, not the front. Confusing because the signage is on the front of the building
2. A bit of a wait for your food. We were the only diners so I'm not sure why it took so long. I think they only had one cook back there
3. The bread. But more on that in a moment

We arrived around 430p, which I guess is an odd time to eat (what meal is that anyway? Lunner? Dunch?). The chef actually greeted us, which was a nice personal touch. The waitress then arrived promptly with a menu. Yes, the selection was pretty big so I decided on the Go Fish Sandwich with fruit. The fish, Basa, was marinated in Pesto sauce and broiled. It was tasty and herby and cooked perfectly. The only problem was the bun- a generic hamburger bun, like the kind you get at Giant Eagle last minute for a BBQ, the enriched white kind. And the fish was way longer than the bun so I ended up folding it in half. The fruit consisted of small slices of pear with store bought dried cranberries on top. Not terrible, but it felt a bit like an afterthought. Mika ordered the penne pasta with chicken and red sauce. It was ok, but tasted like something easily made at home with a jar of stewed tomatoes.

For dessert we ordered the flour less chocolate torte. It was ok, but very boozy tasting! Rum perhaps? Either way it was pretty strong- whew! Not that we complained, as we both love a boozy dessert, but this part wasn't mentioned when we ordered and probably should have been, due to folks with allergies, non drinkers, ect. 

I really loved the homemade kaleidoscopes on the tables (NOTE- do not try to twist them- they do not twist) and the big colorful triangles. I am hopeful that they will work things out and become a real LV gem! I would go there again, maybe for brunch next time."}
{"text":"DO NOT GET THE GNOCCHI.  They're just mashed potatoes fried on the outside. Mushy on the inside indicates they're mashed potatoes and nothing else resembling pasta. If you want mashed potatoes presented differently, get the \"gnocchi\". I'm disappointed. :-/. Truly."}
{"text":"Really reasonably priced. Dinner for two, salads, entrees, and wine (byob) for around $50 on a Friday night before a show is pretty great! The gnocchi nirvana is truly nirvana. I can't say enough about how delicious it was. I highly recommend you make reservations. It's very small and intimate. I wish we had saved room for dessert!"}
{"text":"This café is the reason I like to wander backstreets for hours on end, because when you find a gem like this, all those hours are worth it. Every single one. 

The only thing, literally, the *one* thing that makes me not want to yelp this place, is that I'm afraid I won't get  the owner's undivided attention when I go back and it's packed. 

So I sat down in the dining room, completely alone. Some Ben Harper came on and the chef/owner/waiter handed me a menu. He asked me what I was in the mood for and I rattled off random thoughts (filling but not heavy and a little spice perhaps?)...I ended up getting a cranberry sausage dish smothered in a sweet sauce with hits of cayenne and topped with brie. 

I know, I know, food porn. It was even better than it sounds. Not one flavor was overpowering so every bite was a perfectly balanced little world.

The owner hung out with me after cooking and we talked about his travels (roasted goat in Africa is where it's at!) and future menu plans (gorgonzola cheese cake topped with bacon!). We agreed that if the world ever runs out of bacon you can throw us in the river because who wants to live without the sweetest of all meats? 

Everything (including an ice tea) was under $15. The menu is probably best classified as \"New American\" or \"Modern American.\"

It was nice (it was better than nice, it was awesome) to find real foodie dishes being served in a relaxed atmosphere where I felt comfortable walking in off the street in my lazy Sunday clothes.
 
And next time I'm getting the deep friend gnocchi because that's so genius it can't be ignored."}
{"text":"Super sweet staff, great selection for vegetarians.  I was blown away by the gnocchi.  Portions are a little bit small, would order apps or a salad next time."}
{"text":"My Foodie Friends and I have tried to schedule a dinner at Kaleidoscope for quite some time now, but something always interrupted our schedule.  So when we had the opportunity to dine on my ACTUAL birthday, how I could I say no?

Definitely off the beaten path, but a hidden gem is a better description!  Small in size but not in flavor.  We were informed that Tues - Thurs if you order 2 entrees and a small plate, you get a complementary bottle of wine (which worked out perfect since we forgot our wine for this BYOB dinner).  Sign me up for an entree!

We were offered a selection of red or white wine for our free bottle - I chose a red Cab Sav.  I've become more of a craft beer snob than a wine connoisseur... maybe I should switch sometime?

Our small plate was Deep-Fried Gnocchi -house gnocchi deep-fried and tossed with fresh herbs and Romano cheese served with homemade marinara for $7.  I never knew Gnocchi could taste so good!! Light, fluffy, and DELICIOUS!!  Side note - I normally take pictures of the food but a) I was starving that night and b) it was too good to stop eating!

When dinner arrived, my plate smelled YUMMY!  Oven-Roasted Salmon finished in a sweet miso, pistachio crust and served with sesame sautéed baby bok choy, wild mushroom, and barley risotto for $24. PERFECTLY cooked salmon and incredibly flavorful!  I ate EVERY bite.  I could have licked the plate clean I enjoyed it that much.

Rich had the Coconut Curry Polenta with shrimp, hot sausage, and pineapple for $22.  This dish looked devine and he enjoyed it as well... so much that I didn't even get a bite :)

We skipped dessert since I had a mini cake at home waiting for me, but we all agreed that we must return to Kaleidoscope Cafe.  A tasty treat on 43rd st in Lville."}
{"text":"I've been here twice--once for restaurant week, once this past Friday--and the experiences differed. My first time, I was not too pleased with the food (we got the coconut curry polenta and it was much drier than expected). However, this past Friday, the food our group got was delicious. We got the crab dip, a salad, chicken pot pie, sweet potato pasta, and the cow jumps over the moon pasta. Everyone was very happy with their orders.

In terms of ambience I've been happy both times. It's a great place for a date. It's cozy and intimate, BYOB, and the servers are very friendly.

Lastly, I think the prices are very fair. Portion sizes are relatively large (we had extra both times) and the food is tasty.

I suggest checking it out even if it is a bit out of the way. You'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"I need to actually visit Kaleidoscope Cafe after having a sample of its greatness last night. I was at an event where there was a sampling of the hummus and now all i want is to go there and order everything off the menu. The hummus was excellent so I can only imagine how good everything else is."}
{"text":"When you travel in search of food as much as I do, you start to look for the not so ordinary. Boy does this fit the bill. The menu is a lesson in creativity and corkyness(is that a word?). Duck cannoli? Fried gnocchi? Who thinks of the stuff. Kaleidoscope does! I am not a big fan of gnocchi, but this preparation transforms it to something unrecognizable, but oh so magical. A stroke of genius! My only knock would be the interior of the restaurant which I feel can use a little more TLC, a little paint, fresh decor to match the menus personality and we have an absolute winner."}
{"text":"This place is a delight. Vegetarians, many of the dishes can be made meatless, so don't be afraid to ask. In fact, they have SOY-rizo which you can substitute for the Mexican chorizo with a couple entrées. This tells me all is made to order (I approve!) The decor is more homey, artsy/craftsy then fancy/schmancy. Not my taste but the effort is appreciated. Don't forget to BYOB... or on certain nights, when you order 2 entrees and an appetizer (they call it a \"small plate\") you get a complimentary bottle of wine. We finished with coffee and flowerless chocolate torte. Perhaps the best I've ever had in my long dessert-filled life. FRESHly brewed coffee (just for me!) makes all the difference. The chef/owner came out to say hello and check on us. An appreciated touch. Would recommend and will return (that the chocolate tort better be on the menu!!!)"}
{"text":"The sign on Butler street said that the cafe was 2 blocks down the side street. However they are 2 very long blocks. There are a couple of cute houses on the way as well as a place for Pittsburgh cyclists. The cafe building is beautiful. It is like a huge mural. The inside decor was a let down. The walls are covered by fabric covered triangles. The cafe takes reservations and is BYOB. We went early on a Friday night and we were able to get in without reservations. The dining room is small but filled up quickly. There were 2 big tables of older women. Both groups brought a lot of wine so it's safe to say that they were going to be there for awhile. One of the tables was very loud. 
My husband ordered an entree called something along the lines of a Cow Jumping Over the Moon. It was steak medallions over a bed of creamy mushroom sauced linguine. The steak was cooked nicely but the cream sauce had zero flavor. I mean zero. He was disappointed. 
I ordered a scallop dish that was severed over bow tie pasta. The scallops were salty and my pasta had no flavor either. It had tiny pieces of tomato and an a brown butter sauce but none of it had any flavor. I had not eaten all day so I was starving. Being served a bad dish is beyond disappointing. Their menu is small and they have been serving the same dishes for quite awhile. That means the dishes should have been perfected not bland. About a third of my bow tie pasta was overdone to the point of being brown and crispy. At first I tried to pick those pieces out but it wasn't worth it. The whole experience was extremely disappointing. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place.  Went for lunch and did our normal sharing ordering.  Had and app of a pulled duck cannoli with a delicious sauce of white chocolate and pistachio.  It sounds weird but it was scrumptious.  Ordered a Kaleidoscope salad and build a burger.  For the burger we had brie, mushrooms and spinach.  It was juicy and delicious and had a toasted bun; served with fries.  Fries were awesome too.  The salad was spinach with corn and bacon and the dressing was very bright tasting.  Dessert was poached pear with fig reduction and candied walnuts.  I am not a pear fan, but this dessert was delicious.  I have been wanting to come here for some time and I am glad that I finally did.  The service was friendly, place was clean and food was spot on.  Oh,  and it is BYOB.  Will be back to taste more."}
{"text":"After reading good reviews and seeking an affordable restaurant with interesting food and a neighborhood vibe, I chose Kaleidoscope. What a mistake. We were fine with the somewhat down in the heels surroundings and the messy interior--bussing buckets in full view, etc., but the service was so inept. We waited a long time  for our waiter to appear. He hurriedly took our order then disappeared. He returned with our salads and soup, but couldn't remember where any of them went. He never cleared them before our entrees arrived, again forgetting where everything went. Then there was the food. Everything was edible, but barely better than my home cooking at its worst. My husband's soup, a corn chorizo chowder, was bland and weirdly gritty. The two salads we ordered both lacked the advertised ingredients. My daughter had the scallop pasta. The scallops were flaccid and flavorless and the bow tie pasta beneath them was crunchy from being under a heat lamp too long. There were huge pieces of walnut scattered in the dish which was a weird taste combo with the scallops. My pasta was something I would feed a toddler-overly sweet tomato sauce with an occasional corn kernel or pea. It came with a cup of powdery cheese which looked like it was out of a can. I was so desperate to flavor it, I asked for more cheese powder, but never got any. The best entree was the salmon with a very odd, creamy barley risotto that had strands of brown pasta in it and a pile of watery bok choy. Our waiter never cleared our plates; he just plopped down the bill which was over $30 a person--a high price to pay for such a sad combination of bad service, bad food and sloppy atmosphere. What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. As many others have stated the duck cannoli was good, but not worth all the hype. The salads were tasty and the gnocchi were delicious though. I reallyappreciate that it is byob, I'll be back with some wine next time. 5 stars if it were a bit cheaper."}
{"text":"Neat little spot, good for sharing a few small plates over a bottle of wine (they're BYOB). The entrees are worthwhile, even if each one needs a little bit of work.

In my opinion, Kaleidoscope would be best to experience with a few bottles of wine or beer and some friends that don't mind sharing a few salads and appetizers. The staff is friendly, the chef is dedicated, and they make some nice house butter."}
{"text":"Second trip to Kaleidoscope Cafe, both before downtown events - so this is an Early Bird Review!

Staff - extremely friendly and accomodating - yes, it's easy to do when the place is almost empty at 5:30pm, but it is appreciated nonetheless!

The food here is amazing.  Every dish, both times.

Duck Cannolli with pistashio dust - stuffed with tender, juicy duck.  

Deep Fried Gnocchi were very light and the marinara was so flavorful that I was compelled to eat a forkful by itself.

The salads are all beautiful, unique and tasty.

The Cow Jumped over the Blue Moon is a pasta dish that I have seen twice - both times receiving high praises.

I have had the Scallops and the Michigan Chicken Pot Pit - both were yummy.

Here's another thing - The Menu.  The Kaleidoscope Menu is extremely descriptive.  This is very helpful when ordering.  One friend has a no-thanks issue with beets, the other amore significant issue with walnuts - neither were hindered in choice because they were able to request those items left out.  LOVE A DESCRIPTIVE MENU!

Parking is not awesome, even at 5:30pm on Thursday.  Wouldn't guess at how busy they would be if this were not a factor.

Great place when heading into the city from the east and worth the trip across the city from the west!"}
{"text":"This place violates Lord Samuel's axiom (location, location, location), because you won't find it unless you're looking for it. It's worth seeking out, though. The food is simple, but very good. Lots of robust flavors. I only wish the salads came pre-dressed. Service was quite friendly. Ambiance is quiet, probably directly related to their way-off-Butler location. Prices are very reasonable. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pros:
- Simple, delicious food - well prepared and attractively presented. Really, what more can you ask for?
- Solid, reasonably sized menu. It's always a good thing when deciding what to get is such a challenge.
- Prompt, attentive service that isn't overbearing. Shawn was the only server when we ate there, and he did an awesome job!
- Careful attention is paid to food allergies and dietary restrictions.
- Memorable decor but still has that Pittsburgh casual vibe!
- The chef came to each table and asked how the experience was.

Cons:
- BYOB. I know this is a pro for some but not for me.  I'd love to know what a great job Kaleidoscope could do with drinks!
- The joint is small.
- Off the path a bit.
- Parking is a little tricky.
- Cash is preferred.

Would return: YES.
Would recommend: YES."}
{"text":"I admire a chef that wants to cram as many styles of bacon/pork into a menu!

I finally got to try this place out my husband really enjoys. We shared a few items over lunch, and I am in love!

The Warm Brussel Sprout Salad did not disappoint. The sliced brussel sprouts and spinach mixed with a duo of cheeses and vinaigrette was delicious. Everything paired so well together.

The deep fried gnocchi were deliciously crispy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. Now some marinaras are ho-hum, this marinara was the bomb and probably better than the gnocchi. I would like to eat an entire meal of the marinara sauce. It was full of tomato flavor, and seasoned just right. (May have to go back and try the Classic Pasta Marinara on the menu!) It's hard to get a simple marinara just right, but Kaleidoscope has zero issues with that. Bravo!

The Tuna Gyro was good, and I really enjoyed the cucumber sauce. The tuna was cooked very nicely.

Finally, since everyone else was ordering soup (and at a friend's encouraging who stopped in for lunch too) we tried the Broccoli and Asparagus soup with cheddar. Hands down, best soup I've ever had. Never thought my favorite soup, broccoli, could get better by adding asparagus!

Service = friendly and knowledgeable. A few us were expanding our knowledge about wet vs. dry scallops this particular day. Love it when food knowledge gets dropped on this foodie!"}
{"text":"You get a distinct feeling when you walk into Kaleidoscope Cafe that its a very hip, artistic kind of place. It's a restaurant where I instantly felt comfortable. A small, cozy space without any pretense. Service was stellar throughout our entire evening on both food and BYOB. They kept refilling our glasses for us and anticipating the next cork to pop!

Our group of 4 sampled starters of the gnocchi nirvana which is deep fried with chorizo and served with kafta, an Indian tomato cashew sauce and the duck cannelloni. The gnocchi was stellar with those little pillows of deliciousness so perfectly sauced. We'd read the reviews & knew they were a must have & boy were they ever! Thanks Yelpers!!!! The duck was pretty good too but we all focused on the gnocchi. 

I ordered the Kaleidoscope Salad with spinach, bacon, avocado, corn and cilantro citrus dressing. Very tasty! My entree was the Scallops Buerre Noisette with seared scallops, walnuts & tomatoes in a delightful brown butter sauce over farfalle pasta. The brown butter sauce was rich and nutty and pretty much perfect. 

The menu isn't large but still manages to cover a wide range of tastes. It's very obvious that everyone there truly cares about what they do and it's a fun, delicious and very cool place."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan. The host (Dan) shuffled a few things to accept my reservations--Dan even called back to accept them (Level 10 props). I like the eclectic exterior. Fortunately, I can walk, so parking isn't an issue. Our party of 6 mostly ordered pastas. The Classic was meh, but my Cow Jumped Over the Blue Moon was fantastic. They season the steak so it has a slightly sweet taste, which worked well in the cream sauce. Everyone was happy, a couple of us more so. 4 stars, not 5, because the Classic was lifeless. Everything else merited more visits."}
{"text":"Once again, it was a Friday night, and I had no idea where in Hades to go with Kay for supper. That was until I remembered that Kaliedoscope Cafe resides in the neighborhood of my employment. 

A forgotten, costumed criminal is truly the owner of this restaurant. His motif of joyously exploding triangles can be found all over the dining room. Gourmet food must be a more lucrative business these days than supervilliany. Hey, eats this good could turn The Kingpin into a harmless bon viviant. 

I know that the Deep Fried Gnocchi transformed me from a grumpy Hulk (it was a long, pissy day at the asylum) into a content, well-adjusted Bruce Banner on a date with Betty Ross. 

Deep Fried Gnocchi: It might sound unusual, and perhaps it is, which is why it works. You'd think they'd be doughy, crispy, but instead they just evaporate in your maw, almost as if they're imaginary, made not by flour and eggs, but wishes and dreams, the tart, chunky marinara only enhancing what is a small castle in the air of an appetizer. 

The Kaleidoscope Dip was too good of a read on the bill of fare to pass on, so we almost ordered it in addition to the gnocchi, but our exemplary server regretted to inform us that they had sold out of it that day. 

Onto another titular dish, the Kaleidoscope Salad. Lavishly leafy spinach starred along with bacon particles, avocado bits, tomato, sweetly roasted corn, and a postively tropical, zesty cilantro citrus vinaigrette in a feature so satisfying, I almost didn't feel I that needed a main course. There's something oxymoronic about such a salad with its salty, greasy bacon, the lardy avocado, and the 
healthful spinach. something that defeats the purpose, yet the salad all adds up to a sum greater than its parts. 
 
Compliments from the chef came a gaggle of toasted pita triangles (there's that theme again...) with a cherry-lemon butter that melted sacchariferously, acerbically, wondrously onto the sultry bread. Was this a ruse or an olive branch?

Timed perfectly, the Scallops Beurre Noisette came to our table, its cauterized scallops lying seductively, shivering with antici...pation on a bed of Klaus Nomi-worthy farfalle pasta (do. not. call. it. 'bow-tie.' I satirize the food snobs...). Toasted walnuts, diced tomatoes, and a brown butter sauce hang around in the periphery to make the entree all the more gustatorily interesting, one that would have been woodsy, humble, if not for those sensuous scallops that were so juicy and flavorful, I tried in vain to save them for last, resisting the urge to eat each of them whole. 

Kay had The Cow Jumped over the Blue Moon. As whimsical as it is sharp on the taste buds, this dish was made up of lasciviously tender beef slices, ideally al dente fettucini, a powerhouse Gorgonzola cream sauce, and a candy-coated onion confit that acted as a welcome contrast to the biting nature of the cheese.

For dessert I had the Flourless Chocolate Torte, Kay had a Lemon Rosemary Tart, and halfway through each one, we switched! The torte was absolutely possessed by an evil spirt of some kind that I suspect may have been rum. Nonetheless, it was rich and celebrative of cocoa. Surprisingly, being a chocolate addict, I liked the Lemon Rosemary Tart even more for its sunny, somewhat arcane palatableness and delightfully thick, cookie-like crust. 

After our meal, we encountered Kommander Kaliedoscope himself. He attemped to fire fractal missiles at us only for us to richochet some of them upward with shields we had hidden on our persons. One piece of shrapnel cut loose a strange sculpture that was hanging from the ceiling, directly above KK. It fell on top of him, rendering him immobile. 

\"Please spare me. I'm just trying to make an honest living. Why can't you hero types leave me be?\"

\"Do you promise to go on the straight and narrow?\" Kay acted as interrogator. 

\"Yes. I...had some parking tickets. I thought you were comin' after me.\"

Kay and I looked at each other. 

\"No, we just came for dinner,\" I reassured him, pulling the structure off of his gaudily costumed body, \"I apologize.\"

\"In that case, stay awhile, have some wine.\" And thus ended our LoLa adventure. 

I kid, kid.  I'm not suffering from comic book delusions. We did speak with the owner upon leaving, however. A gracious fellow he was.

Like the cylindrical toy it takes its name from, Kaliedoscope Cafe has injected a dram of amusement, color, and life into this slumbering part of the neighborhood. Frequent this establishment, frequently, for they take food and twist it around for you to experience in all its beautiful forms through both your eyes and palate.

{"text":"The duck cannolis are fantastic!! One of the best things I have ever tasted! The staff was very friendly and because it wasn't a busy night, the chef came out and talked with us and told us some stories behind his inspiration for his food. Would recommend this place to anyone and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Come and enjoy your meal and your company.  What a nice relaxing place!  Cool table painted by local artists, that you can buy.  Some other art work and including some glass art that is chunks of broken glass & cut glass on salvaged windows.  
The menu has some simple yet contemporary cuisine that has some whimsical creations. 

We sampled the Saute of Chicken Apple Sausage and were not disappointed.  Very good!.  The Scallops Beurre Noisette on farfalle pasta was very tasty and perfect cooked.  The meal came with some bread with an orange butter that was so tasty! 

Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  Our appetizer was brought out by someone else, who was not able to answer a question on the food and she did not try to find out.  We did ask our waitress later and received our answer.   

This is the type of restaurant that you can relax enjoy your meal and not feel rushed.

BYOB."}
{"text":"Awesome, creative, innovative food, for a really great price. Hidden in the back streets so a bit quiet. Also the chef Dan is a great guy. BYOB. Definitely worth going."}
{"text":"Wife and I went here last week for dinner one night.
I had the Filet Mignon with french fries and a house salad.
If I was in New York i would say pricing was ok but for Pittsburgh the steak was way over priced.
The service was fast and friendly and the food was good but not great.
I do not think I would go back again as I found the pricing was high and the food was just ok nothing special."}
{"text":"The night we went, our server informed us that they were particularly busy and that it would take some extra time for the food to come out. We didn't mind waiting, so this was fine with us. We weren't too crazy about the entrees (especially since a quarter of them weren't available that night...), so we shared three appetizers (crab dip, apple sausage, and the duck cannoli) and one entree (chicken pot pie). Nothing about the food was spectacular: the crab dip was just crab dip, the apple sausage was a bit too heavy for me, the duck in the cannoli was very dry, and I found the chicken pot pie too sweet. However, the deep-fried gnocchi that the table next to us got looked good. The tables were kinda cool, but I thought the theme of the restaurant was poorly executed everywhere else. This was not worth going off Butler for.

{"text":"I came here during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week.  It's not somewhere you'd normally run into while roaming around Lawrenceville and can look a little too residence-y to even have a restaurant but there it is!  

The restaurant is small but cute.  Instantly the smell of coffee hit us which is always a plus in my book!  I had the scallops here - my first time ever having scallops - and I was really impressed.  Perfect sear on the scallops and the pasta is came with was cooked perfectly al dente.  I also recommend the fried gnocchi - I know!  The main reason we ended up coming here was because of the fried gnocchi.  So good!  

At the end of the meal the chef came around and greeted everyone which was really nice.  I really like this place.  Seemed comfortable and like everyone cared about the food.  The service was also good.  Great for a date if you want somewhere to eat before hitting up the rest of Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"Cool name for a cafe though too bad I can't spell kaleidoscope without looking it up. You won't miss this spot if you're driving down the street as the exterior is painted brightly. Very cool how each table has its own actual kaleidoscope and how the interior has various shapes for decor on the walls and ceiling - certainly makes your eyes wander around curiously.

Food was really good - we shared the duck cannoli and fried gnocchi, which were both unexpectedly delicious. I've never had a savory cannoli before. I ordered the beat salad and my boyfriend ordered the apple sausage pasta which had some pears in it.

Server was incredibly nice and apologized in advance for the slow service that he brought out some warm toasted bread with a strawberry balsamic butter. I think there were three guys in total who were working so we felt bad for the server though the restaurant was about half full for dinner. We waited about fifteen minutes at least for him to come pick up our credit card but in the end we just left cash as we needed to head out.

We will definitely head back with a bottle of wine (BYOB) as we thought the food was great but I hope service will be faster so I can bump up the rating."}
{"text":"we had heard of this place for a while, but never made it. now we're about to go back for the 3rd time for restaurant week in less than 3 months!!! 
for our 1st trip, we had looked over the menu at home, & had heard that the small plates were wonderful, so before we even got there, we knew we wanted to try all of them! 
it was kinda early for dinner, like 3-3:30, but we had been shopping in the strip & hadn't eaten all day! there were only 2 other tables of people, & 1 of them left shortly after we sat down. we just thought it a little odd that they would be so empty on a saturday. plus, it made it awkward for talking cuz everyone could hear you, it was so quiet! towards the end, other folks did start coming in.
so we give the waitress our order of the 4 small plates & a salad. she came back & disappointed us by saying there were no duck cannolis. nnnnooooooooo!!!! now we have to decide on a whole new order!!!
we went with the cornish hen in the fig sauce, & the polenta with shrimp, hot sausage & pineapple. what GREAT choices!!! tom was skeptical of his polenta dish, not sure if he'd like the polenta. he inhaled it! the waitress even commented on the \"cleanness\" of his plate! my hen was out of this world! the skin was perfectly crisp, all the way to the last bite!!! we raved the whole way home about our meals to 1 another, couldn't wait to go again.
a few weeks later, we made reservations for 6:30. we ran into traffic, so i called to let them know we were running late. when we arrived, the place was empty! saturday night at 6:30???? again, people came later, but really???
so we ordered the 4 small plates-the kaleidoscope crab dip, sauté of chicken apple sausage, deep fried gnocchi & the duck cannoli. all i can say is, people go try it!!! the gnocchi literally melted in your mouth. the cannoli was FABULOUS! 1 word of caution-don't try to cut it in 1/2 by stabbing into it with a fork & knife!!! it almost went shooting off the table! break it into pieces at the ends.
aside from the fact it's either not well known &/or not right on butler street, there is no reason for anyone to not try this restaurant. it's small, intimate, byob & truly has some of the best food i've tasted in a while."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 6.  The appetizers ordered were the fried gnocchi, duck cannoli and crab dip. One person also ordered the soup of the day. It was a good start. Everyone was happy with everything ordered. The wait staff was friendly and helpful, and it's byob...what's not to love about that??


3 people ordered the filets and liked them. I had the pork tenderloin. It was good, the black beans were better. But then I found a hair in my food, which basically ruined it for me.  It wasn't long enough to be my own hair.  My boyfriend had the gnocchi nirvana. He said it was ok but not great. The other mean ordered was the Cornish game hen. Which he said was good and tasted like his mom used to make. 

Two people ordered dessert. I had a taste of one that had rosemary and lemon in it. It was delicious. I just don't remember the name.  

Overall everything was ok. Not a bad experience but not a great one either."}
{"text":"Had a get together today with my meet up group and they decided to dine here. Located in Lawrenceville it has a tiny parking lot in the back and there is a dumpster which partially blocks it.

The place was virtually empty so we had a nice long table for ourselves. We had a very attentive waitress who made sure we got our drinks and met our needs. They have a BYOB for a modest fee which we shared while munching on gnocchi appetizers with marinara sauce.

The owner told us the menu was undergoing some changes so there were some substitutions on the entrees. I settled for a portobella mushroom sandwich with a side of fruit. The lady next to me had a new dish. It was Ahi tuna with cole slaw and pasta. The Kaleidoscope salad is also one of their favorites.

We had to wait quite a while for the food but I figured since we were a large group that it would take extra time. My sandwich was good. The lady next to me let me sample her tuna. It was to die for!

The restaurant is very small and they have decorative art on both the tables, the ceiling, and the walls. Prices can be reasonable to a bit pricey depending upon what you order. Since we had shared the appetizer the sandwich was enough for me.

It is a great place to visit but street parking is terrible. I was grateful we arrived before it opened at 11 so that I could park in their lot. There is a sign telling you that the lot is monitored so you must move your car if you intend to go anywhere else.

I look for different experiences and was glad to partake in a new restaurant which I hadn't tried yet."}
{"text":"Took my best friend here for her Birthday! So yummy... Try the cow jumped over the blue moon Pasta... Sooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! We didn't even have a chance to try the food because the ONE waitress that worked there got our drinks but never came back to take our food order. Another couple came in and sat down after us and she took their order before ours. This place is not even worth your time."}
{"text":"My Husband dragged me here on a night where I wasn't even sure I wanted to eat let alone go out.  Boy was I wrong.  This was one of the single greatest meals I have ever eaten. 

The service was excellent, specifically considering that there was only one waitress on for the whole restaurant and one hostess, who wasn't even the regular hostess she was just filling in for a friend.  They were on top of everything and worked together to make sure that the water glasses were always full and that plates were delivered and cleared in a timely manner. 

The meal began with homemade pita bread and butter that was flavored with amazing sweet and salty properties, but I can't even remember what flavors. 
We then had the Fried Gnocchi with homemade marinara.  These were the lightest gnocchi I have ever had.  It was as though you put the gnocchi in your mouth and then it disappeared leaving a delicious flavor in its path. 
We also started with the Duck Cannoli.  There was a large amount of duck that spilled out of the cannoli onto the plate that had a delicious white chocolate sauce on it that worked very well with the duck.  
Rotem D. ordered the cow over the blue moon pasta which was delicious and the gorgonzola sauce was delicious. 
I ordered the cornish hen which was out of this world delicious.  The sauce over the hen was outstanding and really complemented the light taste of the hen.  The accompanying potatoes and snow peas were delicious as well.
After all of that delicious food we couldn't imagine not trying dessert. 
We had the Flourless chocolate cake which was delicious and lighter than many other versions that I have tried. 
We also shared the Lemon rosemary shortbread torte which was delicious on its own, but better paired with the flourless chocolate cake. 

I will definitely be back to try more, but it is definitely going to be hard not to order those gnocchi and that hen again."}
{"text":"Wow, that curry polenta is quite a dish. As in, seriously go there as soon as you can and get it. It's one of the more creative and tastier dishes I've had in the past year. Just bring your wallet--it isn't cheap! The deep fried gnocchi was also good. The dessert (flourless chocolate cake) was quite tasty but it was also very small."}
{"text":"Talk about off the beaten path!  The place is in Lawrenceville nestled between houses off Butler St.  But once you walk in, it's an adorable little cafe with tiny homemade Kaleidscopes on the tables and giant colorful triangles all over the walls and ceiling.

The menu was actually larger than I thought for lunch with salads, sammies and main dishes like pasta (surprisingly a lot of pasta's actually!).  The people next to us had a huge dish of pasta that looked good, but the fries the other person had smelled even better!  So I opted for the Veggie sammie and fries.  The veggies were eggplant, zucchini and a portobella cap.  The bun was so good!  It was fresh and soft.  I hate when sammies are served on sour dough because, number one, I don't like sour dough, but number two, it's hard to eat!  The fries were just as awesome as they smelled, nice thick cut and crispy!  So the veggies totally canceled out the fat in the fries, right?!"}
{"text":"Second time we ate here - first time we came in just before they closed and assumed that was the reason for the poor service - we were wrong. The waiter was nowhere to be seen most of the night and two of the dishes that came out were cold - one was sent back because it was so cold. This is a classic case of a chef which is probably very good either trying to run a restaurant himself or having someone run it that is inexperienced. We won't be giving this place a third strike - it's out!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the heart of Lawrenceville. This place is definitely a diamond in the ruff.

This small eatery was BYOB, and the food was packed with flavor. Upon entering the  building there was only us and one other table of 3 inside for dinner. The host/server was a little awkward, but overall very friendly. He should be a little more confident as the food was stellar. 

We started off with the Crab Dip as an appetizer. It came out piping hot, with toasted Pita bread to dip with. Salty, creamy, and pretty flavorful, I was satisfied with this as an appetizer. 

Next we shared a farmhouse salad. The candied walnuts, beets, Gorgonzola, and pears complimented the vinaigrette dressing very nicely. The medium salad was plenty for two to split as a starter. 

Main courses, I chose the rosemary pork tenderloin with butternut squash and pancetta hash. My sister chose the Fried Basa with white bean lobster puree. Both dishes were awesome. The large chunks of crispy pancetta paired with the sweet butternut squash and juicy rosemary pork tenderloin really lit up the taste buds like a holiday meal. The Basa was perfectly fried, and the white bean lobster puree was very flavorful. 

For dessert we split a slice of the flourless chocolate torte and the rosemary shortbread tart. Both were outstanding. Packed with flavor. The Rosemary tort was very tart and and the rosemary crust was crumbly and delicious. The chocolate torte was smoothe and rich.

This place is a bit pricey, but the quality of the food is legit.

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"You will not meet a head chef who cares more about his clientele and exudes such passion for his craft than Dan of Kaleidoscope Café. Dan and his wife, Akirah, have created a unique and lovely establishment in the heart of Lawrenceville.

I frequent KC for take-out, and have dined in on multiple occasions, even going so far as to host my last birthday dinner there.  I made a reservation elsewhere (big mistake!), only to find said restaurant had discontinued their BYOB policy. Akirah heard about my plight via social media, and immediately suggested I host my dinner at their place. 

If you've read any of my previous reviews, you know I'm a bit of a scallop (for lack of a better word) slut.  I LOVE scallops, and it's just not a dish I cook at home, so when I'm out and I see scallops on the menu, that is my go-to.  Their pasta and scallop dish is yummy and very filling.  I'm also a big fan of the crab dip, but be careful.  It's quite a generous serving and you don't want to ruin your appetite for your main dish!

For take-out, I'm prone to order sandwiches.  I love that KC offers the option to substitute fresh fruit as a side with their sammies (no additional charge).

The exterior of the restaurant is super-cool.  You just can't miss this place visually, and you shouldn't miss this place because of the super-service and delightful dishes offered."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for awhile. Chef offered some pita and butter spread for free and it was tasty!. Had the sweet potato hush puppies and they were amazing with the dipping sauce! The fried gnocchi with soy chorizo was super!!!! The sauce that came with it was savory and wonderful. The salad with bacon, tomatoes, corn, avacado and lime cilantro vinaigrette was perfect with the spinach base. Loved this place, will go back without a doubt. Interior decoration was a little weird and basic. The staff were all SUPER nice and attentive to us. This place is a hit."}
