{"text":"Schickes authentisches Restaurant mit umfangreicher typischer Karte. Modernes Ambiente, sehr freundlicher Service. Preislich Mittelklasse. Mitten in Clevelands Fressgass umgeben von einem Dutzend anderer guter Restaurants mit gesunder, gehobener unamerikanischer Küche. Eine echte Wohltat."}
{"text":"Best PHO! Very reasonably price. The Pho was hot and comforting. I had it twice in one weekend."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today and it was amazing. The restaurant is right next Lola ' Micheal Simons. It's a beautiful Vietnamese restaurant. The best in Cleveland. I had original Pho and Vietnamese crepe. So so good, you got to and fill your soul up with some Authentic Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Saigon exceeded my expectations! This was my first visit here, along with the rest of my party. None of us had a lot of experience with Vietnamese food and weren't sure what to order. Our waitress was excited to introduce us to Vietnamese and we let her take over and choose dishes for us...at first very hesitantly and unsure of what was going to be served. It worked out great, EVERYTHING was delicious...we had the pork spring rolls, beef curry, salt and pepper chicken (one of my favorites!), pho soup, and chicken salad. We shared the dishes which was fun to try a little bit of everything. If you have room, the coffee is like a dessert! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly excellent Vietnamese food in the midwest.  I lived in the SF Bay area for a number of years so know Vietnamese food pretty well. This is really, really good - borderline 5 stars I think.  We started with appetizers: the lotus salad was outstanding, we could have just eaten that as an entree. The same goes for the salt-and-pepper squid which was a delightful surprise. While portions were generally large, however, this portion was much too small and left us wanting more. The summer rolls were a disappointment, quite bland. They understand seasoning well here so it was head-scratching that there were not some herbs and seasoning in the rolls, relying just on the (fine) sauce on the side to give it flavor.  For entrees, we of course tried to pho. It was great! Right up there with the most memorable I've had. Particularly pleasing was the high-quality of the beef in the pho: it was delicious. Too often, even places with excellent broth, the meat is just sub-standard and I frankly don't eat it. Here the meat was lovely, to go with a broth that is just outstanding.  The other entree I tried was a lemongrass and chili stir-fry. While initially it seemed ordinary, the more I ate the more I liked it. This was a 4 star dish that was entirely overshadowed by the rest of the meal (other than the summer rolls).  Strong recommendation for Vietnamese food lovers, and a good place to try out Vietnamese cuisine for the uninitiated."}
{"text":"Went on a whim while in from Columbus and LOVED this place. We had never had Vietnamese food before, so we were a little nervous at first, but were pleasantly surprised! The waitress was so sweet and gave great recommendations. We had the vegetarian crispy spring rolls, vegetarian sweet and sour soup, and vegetarian crispy noodles (these were the best part of the meal--so simple, but SO DELICIOUS!). There wasn't a huge wine and beer selection, but enough to try several things. They also had good happy hour drink and appetizer specials.  If we are ever in town again, I would totally go here!"}
{"text":"I went to Saigon today, but got a chicken rice noodle dish instead of the pho that I normally order. I was disappointed, to say the least. I was expecting something much better, especially since their pho is so good. Their service was terrible too. I doubt I'll be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Best pho in downtown Cleveland. Also other delicious kinds of soups. When I am trying to fend off a cold in the winter (or if my feet get wet on the way to work and my toes are still cold at lunch time) I go to Saigon and get the chicken broth with noodles and dumplings. Instant warmup."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific at weekday lunch. No hesitation. But terribly inconsistent on weekends and evenings. Been burned twice with substandard meals, barely close to what was served on weekdays."}
{"text":"Funny thing about me.... People who know me well will say that I don't like \"ese\". What is \"ese\"? Any food that has \"ese\" in it. Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese...  I just have never thought it tasted very good. I am always hungry shortly after. I would much rather have something else. So I have to say that I am by no means a connoisseur.   After much arm twisting, I finally agreed to give this a try and I am hooked! I CRAVE it. Especially my stand-by favorite: B9. The vegetarian spring roll over vermicelli. It is so fresh tasting, never leaves me feeling guilty or hungry later!   It is also super quick, which is very important when you are in a hurry. You can be in and out in 40 minutes (usually), which works especially well for lunch.  The restaurant is situated in an up-and-coming area of Cleveland - right in the heart of East 4th Street (near Lola, Pickwick & Frolic, La Strada, Chocolate Bar, House of Blues, Hilarities Comedy Club, and many more).  They also have an outdoor patio, which is nice for people-watching. Beware though -- today the patio was full by 11:45am!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  Not overly seasoned and still was made to taste great.  Healthy and delicious was the pho."}
{"text":"Came to Saigon on Wednesday before the Cavs game with a group of friends. The place was pretty packed, but our food came out fast and delicious. Our waitress Vam (!?) was extremely attentive, eloquent and smart! She made appropriate recommendations based on our specific tastes.  I was impressed with how she memorized everything from drinks to food at once without writing anything down, and even asked careful questions on how we want our drinks tailored. This isn't something you would typically see from other Asian restaurants. The owner also seemed to be friendly and nice.   I would definitely recommend the Chicken Soup (H1), crispy pork rolls, or the pho. The broth here is so flavorful! However, the curry stir fry isn't that outstanding, needs some extra kick. Overall, it was an excellent experience. Will come back to try the salt and pepper seafood."}
{"text":"Predictably safe.  I am a huge Pho fan, but I must say that neither the spring rolls nor the seafood pho amazed me.  And given the price, I expected more."}
{"text":"Saigon is an upscale pho restaurant.  Very cool with a sleek feel and design. It goes along with the other restaurants on East 4th, like the House of Blues and Lolita. Service was very good and attentive. The prices was a little higher than at other pho restaurants in town. However, for the neighborhood its about average.  Food was good, but the portions was average. I had taro bubble tea and it was just ok. The tea was still warm in my glass. I prefer mine in a form of a smoothie.  Other than that, its a place to go for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Never before have I waited longer for a table than for my food to be served. I'm not complaining about that, because the wait was still only 10 minutes, more just amazed.   It was simple, but delicious. Thought the service was great. Price was fitting for lunch downtown and good portion. I felt full, but didn't have any of that heavy feeling.  Look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"Delicious. Had the salted and pepper combo (shrimp, squid and scallops w/ veggies & rice). Server Morgan very nice and most helpful."}
{"text":"Best pho I've ever had in my life. Broth is making my mouth water even talking about it. Great prices for what you get, too!! Would come back every day if I lived in the city."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here! I'm in town often for work and Saigon is on my short list of go to restaurants. Gets VERY busy around lunchtime but it's well worth the wait. Food comes out quickly and I'm always impressed with the quality, freshness, and taste of everything I order!"}
{"text":"Saigon is an excellent option for either lunch or dinner on East 4th! Service is always friendly, the food is always awesome and the location couldn't be better. The Bun entree with charbroiled pork, shrimp and an egg roll is my go to, for takeout or dining in! Their pho is awesome, too!"}
{"text":"I went with six business friends and everyone enjoyed the experience.  The food was excellent, friendly service, and the atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant.  Everyone really enjoyed their meals and the portions were large.  I had the spring rolls and Pho Ga which were both delicious.  The prices were comparable to other restaurants close by."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight after I walked past them and couldn't get the craving out of my head.  OMG, I'm going to have dreams about this place.  The food is just exquisite.  From the Bánh xèo, to the Cá kho to, there was nothing that didn't make my mouth water.   (Are you listening, Seacoast, NH?  Someone open a Vietnamese restaurant!!!)    The service was also superb.  Attentive. Friendly. And they went out of their way to help us try to keep our overtired pre-schooler happy.  I'm going to need to manage another lunch or dinner before we blow out of Cleveland."}
{"text":"We LOVE Saigon!  The food is very FRESH and consistent.  I get the Vietnamese Pancake and my kids love the crispy pork spring rolls.  The soup is outstanding as well (have tried several different kinds).  The service is warm and friendly.  Our waitress knows our orders by heart.  Try something different and head to Saigon!!"}
{"text":"First time here; I ordered the bun with pork. The bun was simply okay. I also ordered the pork spring rolls. The pork was raw and when I asked them to cook it for me I was told that to cook the pork all the way would burn the outside of the spring roll! What? Do they not know how to turn down the temperature of the oil? Or how to cook the pork first and then make it into the spring roll? They also had no sweet chili sauce--only Sriracha. I've NEVER been to an Asian restaurant before that did not have sweet chili sauce!"}
{"text":"I went to Saigon to try out their pho, which someone told me was their favorite in Cleveland.  I was disappointed with the pho but the restaurant itself was fairly good.  I had a blood orange cosmo which was great, and fried tofu appetizer which was also delicious.  The pho was just ok.  The broth was too salty which masked the other flavors.  My friend dining with me also had the pho and agreed.  The restaurant itself is nice, but it seems like they close at 9 on Saturdays?  Seems early."}
{"text":"This place is a good lunch option for coworkers or friends. They have some of the best service on E. Yes, they are a bit pricey, but they are located on E. 4th."}
{"text":"Awesome food.   The salt and pepper calamari was one of the best Asian dishes I've ever had.  On top of that we were able to walk right in."}
{"text":"Ate here when I was in Cleveland on a trip. Good food, courteous service, most important of all, I forgot my credit card when I left from there. The owner mailed it back to me. Thanks, Saigon."}
{"text":"The food was NOT good, ordered the stir fried rice noodles and stir fried egg noodles, the egg noodles were the worst - absolutely no flavor at all and the shrimp were of inferior quality.   The rice noodles were not much better.   We were extremely disappointed in the quality of the food, I would never go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I work downtown. And, during the warmer months, it's nice to go out to 4th St. to grab lunch. This place is consistently good - food & service wise. I've never had a problem with them. I highly recommend this place to everyone I talk to."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the 4 star average is not warranted. I felt the service was average and the food was good, but there are better choices in the area."}
{"text":"verm-a-celli verm-a-celli...vermacelli verm-a-celli verm-a-celli...vermacelli verm-a-celli verm-a-celli ver-ver-vermIcelli ROCK ME VERMICELLI  bad 80s references too much?  ok, how about this one.  if the actual saigon were this snazzy, we wouldn't have left in '75.  too soon?  not doing it for ya?  ok.  wait.    and now ladies and gentlemen, the musical stylings of boublil and schonberg's \"miss saigon\".  the food is good at saigon the spices aren't really hotter than hell but that's ok cuz i can't take the heat and it's swank and it's cool and it'd suck to freak out if the food made you sweat.  or other great hits such as...  you are...chicken and noodles joined by some tasty vegetables sweet sauce and no poodles this ain't china my tummy's full, like a big fat buuuuddha.  and who could forget such classics as...   whyyyyy gaaaaawwwwd why this pork oh such flavor... i'm so full i liked my waistline as it was but now i'll leave two sizes uuuuuuuup.....   call now, and receive an additional tasty spring roll, and a side of more delicious pho (which, i don't know if you know, but doesn't rhyme with the word shmoe, but more closely rhymes with \"duh\"...kind of.)  for only $19.95.   shipping home sold separately, since you might eat so much you need a new ride home."}
{"text":"Vegan friendly!!! A great restaurant that seems to be overlooked by the more flashy restaurants on East 4th st. You know the food is good when you look forward to going back to further explore the menu. The tofu fried rice is amazing! I have been twice and never had to wait. The service is great and the food is better!! A great place to go on a date before head to the more obnoxious bars down the street."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why, but this place doesn't really thrill me the way it does others. I had a rice noodle bowl with crispy veggie spring rolls once and it was tasty, but not something that has stuck in my mind, really. I also had the wonton soup once too. Again, tasty and perfect since I was feeling a little under the weather that day, but it just isn't something that I'm anxious to have again. I wouldn't deny another visit, because there was nothing wrong with both visits, though.   Honestly, I think Wonton Gourmet and BBQ has jaded me on anyone else's noodles/soup/wontons. Sorry, all."}
{"text":"Thanks for recommending Saigon for lunch, Cleveland Yelpers! The food is tasty, especially their char-grilled dishes which have a little bit of charred, smokey, slightly-propaney flavour (I know, sounds terrible, but I like it) that I associate with Southeast Asian street food and it seems to have a variety of healthy choices, which was great for me on while on business travel. It's a good alternative to all the other samey lunch joints around and it never took me more than five minutes to grab a take-out lunch from there.   They do have some nice outdoor seating along that street, which seems like an awesome place for peoplewatching. I would totally have taken the opportunity to do so if I had had the time."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I had been craving pho since moving here from Charlotte, where they had a Vietnamese restaurant every few miles. I live on the east side, 45 minute drive, and it was well worth it. I'll be back. Pho came in a large soup bowl and was full of flavor. Service was excellent, it was clean, and no wait on a Saturday night. Also have a full bar."}
{"text":"I should have trusted my first impression of this place and ignored the good yelp reviews. I assumed I would get gentrified pseudo Pho for about three more bucks than a real Pho house would have. I trusted yelp and ate here anyway only to find out my first impression was correct.   Had I known then that Superior Pho is within walking distance, I never would have come here. Live and learn."}
{"text":"I am really torn when it comes to Saigon  on E 4th Street. #1Pho on Superior is my favorite or maybe 2nd favorite place in town. The ownership is the same, and the food just as good at Saigon, but the prices are slightly more at Saigon  and parking less convenient. I would never say \"don't go to Saigon ,\" but at the same time, I am probably not going to go to Saigon unless I specifically want to hang out on E 4th or somewhere downtown. It definitely has inexpensive, quality dinner and lunch options. However, if I am just looking for a place to eat dinner, I will still go to #1 Pho at 3120 Superior Ave. I am drawn to the warmth of the French influence of the interior. There is a romance that surprises you when you walk through the door. I love that surprised look on friends' faces when I take them there for the first time. I suppose the charm just can't be duplicated. Saigon has great food, although a few of the more exotic Vietnamese dishes are left off their menu, but it just doesn't have the same place in my heart as #1 Pho. I suppose #1 Pho is #1 in my heart after all."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but they served me a mojito without mint, and we had to ask for forks and napkins when our food came out and there were no utensils on the table. It explained why the place was empty."}
{"text":"Eh. So this is the first Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been to, so maybe this isn't fair, but I just wasn't impressed. The lemon grass chicken lettuce wraps were good (and a very large starter), but the rice noodle dish and lemon grass chicken with rice dishes were just...bland. I expected a lot more taste, and was really let down. I ended up mixing the sauce I had gotten with the lettuce wraps into other dishes to try to make them more interesting.  If invited by someone, I'd go back here and probably try their Pho, but I'm not going to wander in on my own or suggest it anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great place for pho that comforts you in all seasons here in Cleveland.  I definitely found this place to be fresh, lively, and tasty.  The only downside to this place is that the booths are a little uncomfortable, but still worth eating at.  The prices are reasonable.  It's a good place to go eat prior to enjoying the activities that surround it."}
{"text":"Pretty solid meal, triple meat pho was delicious. No complaints with the food. However restaurant seemed to be dirtier then necessary on a not-so-busy night. Service could have been slightly quicker and more considerate and kitchen seemed to be slower than necessary."}
{"text":"I had just moved in and wanted to take out family for Vietnamese food, we ordered the sweet and sour soup with chicken.. that was good. Tried the egg rolls, had bun with pork, ordered pretty much family style to share, I thought the vietnamese food was mediocre, would recommend trying somewhere else, atmosphere was nice, clean and quiet, but would not come here for authentic viet food. I think its a little expensive for mediocre viet food.  Of course I am a harsh critic when it comes to viet food, since I compare everything to my family's cooking."}
{"text":"Seems like this place gets decent reviews and I had heard good things about it, so brought a group of friends here before a concert at HoB.    The nice decor was about the only part of our experience that matched the good reviews.  Service was horribly slow (and we were one of only 3 tables in the entire restaurant), food was only passable.  Also two of my personal pet peeves - the owner was sitting at one of the front tables doing the books, and a couple of the waitresses were sitting together in a booth talking and folding napkins.    I guess I should have known when the place was deserted at 7 o'clock.  Will not return.  Oh, and don't get the \"Filthy Martini\".  I should have known I was in trouble when our waitress went behind the bar to make our drinks, but it tasted like over half olive juice.  I like dirty martinis but this one was so dirty it was almost undrinkable."}
{"text":"Delicious pho!   I had the beef and my husband had the chicken and both were phenomenal.  The spring roll appetizer was excellent, too, but not a very big serving.   No big deal, though, really.   We will definitely be back.   Craving it already!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was here.  We ordered the shrimp summer rolls as appetizers, pork Mon nurong and (beef) Bo kho stew.  The peanut sauce with the rolls were very tasty. I enjoyed my stew very much (awesome addition of carrots) and my husband loved the grilled flavor of the pork.  The price for being downtown and service were great as well. Even though the service was slow due to the numerous people here pre-game, the staff were very courteous.  My only complaint may be that the spring rolls were filled with too many noodles and the lettuce wasn't as fresh.  If fresh basil or romaine were used, it may make these stand out more.  However, it was great to eat here."}
{"text":"I am an avid Saigon fan, eating there once a week at a minimum.  Saigon is very conveniently located right in the middle of the action on East 4th street, which is enough to keep some of their less delicious neighbors in business, but Saigon goes above and beyond on the East 4th dining scene.  Takeout is always very efficient (they always have my food ready in under 15 minutes) but dining in is an equally pleasant experience.  The owner is a really nice guy and always is happy to accommodate special requests. As for the food, it's hard to go wrong with most of the items on the menu.  The pho, chicken/shrimp cabbage salad (big enough for a main course), seafood soup, and wonton soup are my usual go-to items.  The spring rolls are also great if you are looking for a lighter appetizer.  The fried rice can be a little heavy but is also a good choice. Many people compare Saigon's Pho negatively to Superior Pho, and while I agree Superior Pho is a better value, keep in mind the location, décor, etc.  Saigon vs. Superior Pho is not an apples-to-apples comparison.  For the chicken cabbage salad, I actually prefer Saigon on both value and taste.  Bottom line:  Saigon is a serious competitor on the East 4th dining scene, with the added bonus of providing a nice assortment of different reasonably healthy, vegetarian, and/or filling options."}
{"text":"I checked this place out as a part of restaurant week...2 for $30.  My bff and I shared the appetizer of Goi Cuon (the sauce was super yummy!) and shared entrees of Beef Satay (super spicy. Even my bff, who loves spice, found it too spicy.) and Ga Roti (the bone in the chicken thigh was annoying, but the dish was still tasty.) and share the dessert of fried bananas (very Mexican and we asked for a side of honey as it needed something a little more).  We had to ask another server to refill our drinks as our server seemed to be missing.  It's a cute place and it was dead which was surprising given that it was restaurant week.  I doubt I'll be back but it was a decent dining experience."}
{"text":"While this place does have ok food, I would definitely rate it in the \"Meh. I've had better\" category.  I do like the fact that there is an Asian-ish place on E. 4th, and I appreciate the fairly quick service and the large menu.  The decor is trendy asian-inspired, and its a super popular place for lunch - Saigon is always packed around noon, and its a good idea to make reservations if youre going at peak lunching hours.   I've heard many people refer to this as a pho place, but if I go there, it would definitely not be specifically for the pho.  The pho is only ok, and none of Saigon's phos come with any of the meats and ingredients that are supposed to come with pho.  Where is the tripe? Where is (my favorite) the tendon?? Why does it not come with enough hoisin or siracha?  Aside from these issues, the rest of the food is meh.  Don't get me wrong, the food is ok for what it is - Americanized generally Asian-ish food.  You can get your spring rolls, your noodle dishes, your fried rice . .  . But you can probably find decent Panda Express-like Asian food for cheaper elsewhere (but I will say that Saigon probably has a nicer ambiance).  Basically you will be fine if you don't go in with the expectation that you will be getting authentic or inspired Vietnamese cuisine.   Bottom line: good lunch place because of the location and quick service, but it makes me sad to hear people say that Saigon serves great Vietnamese food"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4. Saigon is status quo on the outside, but is smack center in the heart of E 4th, still arguably Cleveland's most enchanting eating district outside of Little Italy. There isn't much in the way of frills on inside (which is perfect for lunch crowds), but does detract a bit from ambiance for a date (versus say, neighbors Chinato or Lola).  Cost: 4. Asian food should be cost-effective and Saigon fits bill - reasonable lunch prices and dinner prices are fair, average in low-teens (a bit better priced than some neighboring restaurants nearby).  Food Quality: 5. Most important, the great thing about Saigon is most dishes are fresh and flavorful, in contrast to many cheaper take-out or dine-in Asian restaurants.  You don't feel like msg overload/food coma afterwards.  O.k. appetizers as others have mentioned, but restaurant shines across meal categories. I'd recommend pho, vermicelli, or stir-fry rice dishes (probably in that order).  The Pho gives many restaurants in Asiatown a run for their money.  Service: 4. Standard for most part in my experiences, neither exceptionally good nor bad.  When to return: Lunch - zippy and fresh. Good alternative dinner spot if pricey neighbors are too crowded, as Saigon tends to be less-busy at dinner.  When you want fresh Asian but don't have time to go to Cleveland's source (Asiatown)."}
{"text":"Really not sure whether to give it a 3 or a 4.  My boyfriend and I came here before going to the Cavs game on a Saturday night. Obviously, the place was packed so the service was not great.   We didn't receive our waters until after about 20min after we sat down. We ordered a pork and shrimp summer roll, salt and pepper squid appetizer and a catfish stone bowl entree.   Everything we ordered was deliscious and the quality was nice. The pork and shrimp in our summer rolls were nice thick pieces and the squid pieces were generous as well. But, the squid appetizer did come out cold so the batter was chewy. I think that was just because our server was behind. The only other  slightly disappointing dish was our entree. I thought since it said \"stone bowl\" it would come out sizziling on a stone plate. It came in a regular bowl and the portions were not as generous. I think it being one of the most expensive entrees on the menu...it was not worth.   Overall, I would come again and give it another fair shot when it is not so busy. The service was underwhelming but the food was overall tasty."}
{"text":"Saigon is the best place in Cleveland to get Vietnamese food.  Period.  The Pho soups are amazing.  The broth is unbelievable and the flavors will blow you away!  My favorite is the Wonton with noodles (M3 I think...) but the Hue Beef (B8) is also really good.  Then there are the Bun dishes, which are a mixture of vermicelli rice noodles with bean sprouts and veggies with grilled pork, or chicken, or shrimp or combinations of those.  B7 shrimp and pork is my favorite.  There are also rice dishes but I've never tried those.  If you go for lunch I recommend getting there by 11:45 or else you will have to wait for a table.  Bon is the manager (owner?) and will always try to make sure you have what you need and get you seated as fast as he can.  In fact, all the servers are very nice and they try to serve you as fast as they can.  The only complaint is that they don't keep the Sriracha sauce on the table and you have to ask for it.  Also, don't expect your mobile device to work in there because it won't (AT&T any ways)."}
{"text":"Hands down my all time favorite restaurant.  I always stick with the Chicken Pho and an order of summer rolls.  Since being introduced to Saigon I've tried other restaurants and their Pho doesn't even compare.  The prices are also incredibly reasonable.   I would give them more stars if I could."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT PHO, BEST IVE EVER HAD. My friends all agree with me on this point also. Saigon is hands down better than superior pho. Superior pho is overrated, and the soup just tastes like salt and water in comparison to saigon. Great atmosphere, location, nice host, and almost all items on the menu have been EXCELLENT. the only relatively poor item I've had was the beef stew I believe, in which the beef flavor was overpowering, and while the soup looked beautiful, it was a bit one note. However, almost all items on the menu are incredible. For drinks, one has to try the coconut juice, it's got pieces of coconut pulp and it's divine! Favorite restaurant in cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Saigon is heaven amidst the over-priced under-delivering restaurants of East 4th St. Why? It starts with the food. This is clean delicious Vietnamese food. I get the Cabbage Appetizer with Tofu and it is unbelievable and healthyish (ok the Tofu is fried). I love the rice paper roll appetizers with plum sauce as well as the Bun (it's pasta, no wait it's a salad, no wait...who mixed my salad and pasta and why do I love it).   Service service service. The service is fast and efficient. Late to the Cavs game or that show at the H.O.B? You can be in and out with a delicious meal in 30 minutes. Want to drink? Best prices in town!  The best part of eating at Saigon is I always feel fantastic walking out. Riding that natural high that comes from eating great food at a great price.Get your valet ticket stamped, there is usually a few buck discount!!!"}
{"text":"This place probably only deserves 2 stars but I really want to like it hence the 3 star.  Ambiance: I can't speak to the ambiance of the inside but the patio is nice when you want to enjoy those Cleveland summers. However, said outside ambiance can seriously be ruined when you have a table right next to you chain smoking and playing poker (wtf?) with a screaming kid  Food: The cabbage salad we order was quite delicious. The drinks listed as cocktails actually ended up coming in martini glasses which was really odd considering they have a section of drinks specifically listed as \"Martinis\" and then another section listed as \"Cocktails\" presumably because those drinks have ice in them. Not a huge deal but just strange. Now this is only the second time I've ever had Pho but boy was it a disappointment! It had this strange sweetness to it which I didn't care for, maybe that's how Pho is supposed to taste?  I might return to try some other menu items considering I loved the salad and disliked the Pho. I really like being able to sit outside on E 4th and enjoy the hustle and bustle of a Cleveland night!"}
{"text":"Well done Saigon. They have a big letter \"V\" next to dishes that are alleged to be vegetarian. If you are an actual vegetarian, however, beware. They consider fish sauce to be vegetarian and they will gladly serve it to you. Then they become very annoyed when you complain. Sub-One-Star."}
{"text":"Stopped in Saigon in search of PHO!  It was icy cold out.  The place is super nice and the service was great.  I had the salt and pepper shrimp extra spicy. and the summer rolls.   Delicious !  The menu was way extensive.  I'll be back to try more.  Go with a few people  if you can, that way you a can order away and try a few items.  Enjoy. Friendly vibe.    The cocktail menu looks really tasty. Sadly I had to pass. Next time I will indulge.  Green tea Martini sounds interesting!"}
{"text":"This restaurant, although fast with my takeout order, had really terrible food. Rice noodles tasted like a cardboard box, meat dry and overlooked, veggies old, flavorless."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Saigon yesterday for my first visit. Overall experience was great. Food was fantastic, very clean and crisp decor and a great value. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was fantastic. The service was friendly and attentive. We sat outside and enjoyed the street music and lights. It was a great experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I went here with four other people and there was a consensus of 'eh', it was just A-ok. I had the curry beef. I probably won't be back considering how many better places are in the area. Bac's food blows this place away."}
{"text":"Food is not good and expensive. Not that many choice of Pho... Only star i give is for the service and the location"}
{"text":"Saigon is one of my favorite little restaurants.  First of all, the owner is the best part of this place.  He's totally personable and really loves getting to know customers.  I never feel unwelcome here.  Second, the food is solid.  I've yet to have anything here that isn't properly prepared and promptly served.  For this past visit (restaurant week) the husband and I had the spring rolls (so fresh!) and beef satay (spicy beef cooked to perfection!) and ga xao gung (sauteed chicken breast, fresh scallion strips and ginger).  The chicken was kind of plain compared to the beef but still delicious.  We each had a glass of wine and shared a piece of cheesecake for dessert.   That's a lot of food for $30 bucks but the best part is Saigon is ALWAYS reasonable.   This is my go to place for inexpensive, fresh, somewhat healthy fare.  I love Saigon!"}
{"text":"Saigon is definitely my favorite Vietnamese restaurant downtown. The food is always fresh and the service is super fast!  A big bowl of pho or vermicelli and I'm a happy camper. Try out their grilled port bowl- it's delicious! Hot sweet grilled pork atop of cold vermicelli noodles and crisp veggies. And it's only $9. Why go anywhere else for lunch?"}
{"text":"I love lunch meetings, best excuse to try something new and have someone else pay for it!   You know how you go to a restaurant that doesn't have an English menu and you feel like a dummy mumbling out \"I'll have the Canette de Vendée à la courge violon et châtaignes au jus\". My  years of french don't help with that one. Well, Asian can be the trickiest. I don't want to even try to say \"H tiu gà\" and I feel weird saying \"chicken soup\".   Well, Saigon solves this problem by naming everything with a letter and number in addition to the Vietnamese name and the English one . I got the P1. Rice noodles with rare beef. It was great. The broth was light and the rare beef was a very clean cut. I made it a little spicy with the condiments and my only disappointment was the waitress took my half eaten bowl and didn't ask me if I wanted the rest to go. My business meeting partner had the B7 (basically a vermicelli noodle mixed bowl) and it looked a little dry, but he didn't complain, so who knows.    The lunch crowd was VERY businessman. Lots of suits and ties, but that's common for downtown Cleveland, we aren't all lucky enough to get to wear jeans to work!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend on our lunch hour.  We walked in got seated right away .  The sever took our order , brought out our food right away.  We were able to have a great lunch under 45 minutes.  I would come back here again."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends for a 30th Birthday dinner. There were maybe 15 of us so they were still able to accommodate all of us considering some of us came a bit after 7:30 reservation time. Hearing from my other friends, service was okay but the food is good. A couple of my friends ordered their pho (beef noodle soup); according to them, the broth tasted sweet. Plenty of beef however so I guest that makes up for it.   I ordered their vermicelli with shrimp and a few other people ordered their crepe and vermicelli with pork. All tasted great but the shrimp was a bit overcooked for me. The crepe was excellent and I would definitely recommend that as a starter. No drink menus for some reason. The waitress was a bit slow because when we say we're ready to order, she doesn't come back until 10 minutes later. I know it's a big group but half of the group already ordered and currently eating.   The place is on E 4th Street off of Prospect in Downtown Cleveland so it's centrally located by the Q. There are many other bars along this strip so great place to be at during the warmer months because I believe they have outside sitting. The prices aren't that bad either. The dish I ordered costs $10."}
{"text":"While I'm in other places I search for good Pho. Saigon was good but for finding it on a whim. I wish the spicy lemon grass wasn't so oily and taste like my home favorite in DC. So opted out and got regular pho which was much better! I would return though as my go to in Cleveland"}
{"text":"I'd like to first start off by saying that I have never had a bad dish here.   My usual go-to dish is the Saigon Vermicelli Noodle dish, which combines, pork, shrimp and a sliced spring roll, over vermicelli noodles and yummy vegetables.  The portion is generous and is always delivered within a few minutes of ordering.  I've had a similar dish at other Vietnamese restaurants and none compares to Saigon.   On a recent visit I had the cabbage chicken salad and the summer rolls, as appetizers (which were 1/2 off during happy hour!).   For the entree, I ordered the chicken fried rice, which was very good and my dining companion had the salt-baked chicken, which I sampled and I must say, I will be ordering that dish on my next visit, it was phenomenal!  Service is always great and the food is always consistent."}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food and this was a disappointment.   The portion was a on the small side for pho. Also it was lacking in flavor. All the ingredients were correct for the dish but it was poorly prepared. My wife's food wasn't much better. I was excited after reading the reviews but was let down by the food."}
{"text":"Great place in downtown Cleveland. Had the A1 and A4 as appetizers (fried and fresh rice paper spring rolls respectively) and as an entre ordered the P11 spicy lemongrass pho. Excellent choice if you like spicy food and are looking for a deviation from traditional pho. Fully recommended."}
{"text":"Amazing --- this is one of the best Vietnamese Restaurants in Cleveland.  The service was top notch.  And carry out is available but not easy with the parking.  The food is top notch ... made with love!  I have never got a dish I didn't like!!!"}
{"text":"My first time at a Vietnamese restaurant. I had the chicken in garlic sauce, which was delicious, although I felt the entrees overall were a bit expensive for what was served."}
{"text":"Saigon is a newer restaurant in the row with Lola, Pickwick and House of Blues.  The decor of the restaurant was very slick. Clean lines and nice lighting. The one thing that was a bit strange was the lack of music playing. I like a bit of ambiance music in the backround, it helps fill the natural gaps in conversation espcially when eating.   The food was good, I had the B6, which was a vermicelli dish with good fresh veggies. The chicken was a bit a dry although it was spiced very well.   I went with my parents, my mom had chicken soup, I thought the chicken broth was a bit too pronounced and needed some other seasonings.   The service was a bit a slow, the restaurant was not busy when we were there so there was really no excuse for needing to ask for water more than once.   Overall, It was a nice meal but not spectacular, espcially compared to the quality of the other restaurants on the street. I would only go back if I was in the area and really craving fresh asian food."}
{"text":"We all had the pho and it was an amazing broth, so rich and flavorful. The service was super fast and the outside atmosphere was super lively and fun. The beef was super tender and the veggies fresh. Definitely check it out, so worth it."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice within the past couple of months. I really like this place. Excellent spring rolls, great service, nice location and, most importantly, wonderful pho. Beef cooked just right, great flavor. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I work downtown and walked over to Saigon for lunch with a coworker earlier this week. It was a beautiful day and the patio was full by 12:00 so we sat near the windows inside. The staff here was polite, not over-attentive and our food came out quick and our glasses were never empty so I'm not complaining. I got the cabbage/rice noodle salad (bun, I think) with chicken - so good! \"Like a healthy Asian pasta salad\" is how my friend described it. She got stir fried noodles with veggies and finished everything but the celery (which there was a ton of) so I think it's safe to say she liked it. Lunch was about $11 each with tip which isn't too bad considering how fresh and healthy our meals were, it's easy to spend that much anywhere downtown. I would definitely go back but time up my visit so I could sit outside and people watch."}
{"text":"Saigon tries to be \"hip Asian\" but can't quite pull it off. The decor is nice, but the bright lights give the impression they're closing down for the night.  Asian disco music blares from a boom box in the corner.  Water is served in a plastic Coca Cola cup. The service is okay, just okay. The Pho was bland and I'm not sure how chicken in a soup could be that dry. The crispy pork spring rolls are quite good but probably not worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times.  The food is wonderful,  simple,  tasty Vietnamese dishes.  Lunch time gets really busy and it is hard to hold a conversation,  so you ha to scream.  Too much noise."}
{"text":"Wonton-freaking-fabulous-soup!  I've been itching to go to this little Vietnamese resto for a while now and a business meeting gave me the perfect excuse to. And I must say, it did not disappoint.   In fact, I'd love to bathe in their wonton soup. It's that perfect. Maybe it's because I'm used to cheap, take-out soups, but this was fresh, homemade and damn delicious. Wontons made from scratch, stuffed with pork and swimming in a light, flavorful broth chock full of pork, cilantro, scallions, onions and sriracha (which I added myself, of course.) Yea, it doesn't sound that special, but it was made right. No skimping. My fellow diner chose the Saigon Vermicelli, which has grilled pork and shrimp and we shared the crispy shrimp rolls. Both were extremely tasty.  The service was zippy and the decor was on the trendy side with a touch of culture. Pretty cute and spot on for the location. Parking sucks, of course--that's what E.4th will do to you. Prices were pretty satisfactory for what you get and a lot cheaper than most of the street. A perfect lunch spot!   And those wontons!"}
{"text":"Went w 4 friends on a Monday night in order to be fully energized for watching the Cavs gets demolished. Was empty  My buddy had their Vietnamese beer, which he liked.  We shared some shrimp and pork summer rolls in a peanut sauce, which were quite good.  My brother had the rare beef pho, which he quite enjoyed.  My two friends afraid to try anything they'd never had before liked the chicken fried rice.  I had the chicken lemongrass and chili stir fry, which was great. LOTS of chicken, good amount of veggies, well flavored (still added some dark and spicy sauces), and quite tasty Great food"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho at a very reasonable price. Stumble upon this place on East 4th  during an overcast day. We thought it was the perfect time to grab some pho to warm us up. We're originally from new york so we had high expectations for pho and this place met all of them. They had a good selection of pho and it definitely hit the spot. The restaurant had plenty of seating and a clean interior. Service was fast and the food was good, can't ask for anything else! Would definitely come back here and now I recommend it to everyone visiting from outside of Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I'm a pretty frequent visitor to Saigon for lunch, so unlike most of my reviews, I won't talk about a single visit in particular.  Needless to say, I'm a fan.  Saigon probably won't be the best Vietnamese food you've ever tasted, but it's pretty good and, for the most part, service is quick--which makes for an ideal weekday lunch spot.  As for the food, the Crispy Spring Rolls (A01) is a solid appetizer choice.  On a more adventurous day, I went with the Shrimp Paste on Sugar Cane (A05), which really wasn't that exciting (or tasty) of a choice than what the title may imply.  The noodle soups are very good.  My personal favorite is the Pho Saigon (P4) which is a mix of beef, brisket, and beef meatballs in a bowl of noodle soup.  The big downside to getting any of the noodle soups, though, is that inevitably drops of soup will get on your shirt as your dealing with the relatively large pieces of meat or long noodles.  I also like the rice dishes, which really are as simple as they sound.  My personal picks are the Grilled Pork over Rice (C1) and the BBQ Beef over Rice (C2).  For those less interested in meat, there is an abundance of vegetarian options.  Finally, a pretty decent dish that I have occasionally had is the Chicken Fried Rice, which is off-menu, but is also pretty much what you would expect.  The service is generally very good, but, unlike a lot of Cleveland lunch spots, the place can get pretty busy (though short of a line forming at the door or anything like that).  As for the restaurant as a whole, there is a two seat bar at the back that I've only seen people sit at once in all my times there.  Also, the restaurant's choice in background music can be a bit peculiar at times, particularly when you hear dance music that you would more likely hear at a club...or maybe a rave.  Oh, and if you want Cleveland celebrity star-power, I once saw Mark Shapiro there..."}
{"text":"These guys are without a doubt the best Cleveland restaurateurs I know. Their service has never been anything less than impeccable...and friendly, to boot! Just tonight, I raced in the door five minutes before closing time hoping for a pork vermicelli. I'm an idiot; and despite the kitchen being officially closed, the owner handed me a complementary to go container of fried rice. I've known and loved this company for years; and today they loved me back. Please give this restaurant a chance to welcome you into their warm embrace, too!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Every Friday I stop in and have B2. James always takes good care of me and even better when I bring in guests. I've had other noodle bowls in Cleveland,  yet not as good as this. A8 is another favorite of mine."}
{"text":"I can't believe I only gave them 4 Stars ... this place is amazing! Hands down my favorite place on East 4th.  FABULOUS!   Tip: Make a reservation to avoid the Lunch Rush!"}
{"text":"Good pho! Rare beef and meatball is very tasty. Well made broth. and I am a huge pho lover. I'm impressed."}
{"text":"If you're on East 4th Don't Miss Saigon.  Been there half a dozen times, and never had a bad meal.  Sometimes the help is out of sync, but they are always friendly and try to get it right.  The food is always fresh, never over cooked, typically, light and tasty.  Stopped there tonight on the way to the Tribe game with my wife and it was a home run.  My wife had the grilled chicken vermicelli appetizer which she found tasty, fresh, and without too much of an onion taste.  I enjoyed immensely the shrimp, squid and scallop stir fry which was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  I've directed several of my Asian clients to this joint and all of them have loved it.  There may be more famous people who operate restaurants on E 4th, but if you want a good meal, this is the place to try."}
{"text":"I very much enjoy Vietnamese food.  I found Saigon on 4th Street in Cleveland, OH.  I had the Pho Tai and was very impressed on the quality and the taste.  I highly recommend it if you are ever in Cleveland. I also had a great conversation with the owner who was very freindly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch places. The noodle bowls are delicious! The owner is always super nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a coworker last week. We got there around 12:30 so it was very packed with the work lunch crowd. It took a little bit for somebody to seat us, but they were able to seat us without a wait at a larger booth. It also took a little time for somebody to come over for our orders, but this was very understandable with how crowded it was. Everything on the menu looked great, but I settled with the Chicken Broth Pho Soup, very much like chicken noodle soup. It was a cold day and I was getting over being sick so this hit the spot! It can just be a little difficult to figure out how to eat Pho if you haven't had it before, but using a fork and the ladle help. I was impressed with how quickly the food came out once we ordered. I had previously been to the restaurant a few years ago and got the Cabbage salad which is another great Vietnamese dish. I had been seated on the patio when I went that time in the summer and it's a great East 4th street summer patio spot. One surprise and nice thing that happened during my last visit was the manager came over and handed everyone in the restaurant a large bag of Vietnamese candies for a Christmas gift. I need to make sure not to wait as long next time to come back here!"}
{"text":"Went with a party of 17 without a reservation, they were very accommodating. Food was good but not very authentic. Not good with special requests and added our 18% gratuity after tax."}
{"text":"I was in Cleveland for a chorus contest and was fighting a cold.  I was glad to see that there was a pho restaurant nearby because Pho always makes my throat feel better and helps to clear things up.    We walked in without a reservation around 5:00 and were seated right away.  Apparently they had most of the tables reserved at 6 and 8 so it looks like we had good timing.  I was surprised to see reservations for Pho because most of the places I'm used to are more laid back.  It was also interesting to see an extensive drink menu with a wide variety of cocktails, wines and sakes.  We skipped on the alcohol and just ordered tea and water.  The jasmine tea was a perfect compliment to the meal and stayed at a nice temperature throughout my meal.  I ordered the fresh spring rolls as an appetizer and my husband had the grape leaves.  Both were tasty although the wrap on mine was a tad soggy.  It didn't impact the overall taste, but the texture was disappointing.    I had the rare beef pho.  My husband ordered the spicy lemongrass soup.  He commented that he loved the kick it had and felt it had an almost smoky flavor to it that totally made the dish.  I enjoyed the flavor of my pho and also the fact that there was a nice amount of beef in it.  More then I have typically seen in other pho restaurants.  I did need to add quite a bit of siracha sauce to add flavor, but I like my pho hot.  Service was attentive but not intrusive.  The layout of the restaurant has booths on either side with tables in the middle.  When you are in the booths, you feel decently private and about a half hour into our meal, it seemed they dimmed the lights for a more romantic/evening feel.  The one thing that was odd was the 80s power ballads that were blaring over the PA.  I enjoy the 80s just as much as the next person, but it was an odd music choice for a Vietnamese restaurant.  Overall an enjoyable experience and someplace I would stop at again the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The hubs and I decided to check out Saigon one Saturday evening while strolling thru East 4th.  The food was good, nothing stood out though to me.  The staff seemed irritated to some degree as it was getting close to closing time but still a lot of patrons eating outside.  I ordered the red curry chicken which was tastey and my husband ordered a stir fried chicken dish.  His dish had an odd/funky fish like smell to it which would have turned me off immediately!  But given we were both so hungry he ended up eating it.  We did enjoy sitting out on the patio, enjoying the great summer evening and people watching.  I would not go out of my way to eat here and honestly we probably won't go back as it just seemed to be a \"higher\" priced restaurant given its location (touristy)."}
{"text":"I had the Wonton soup with BBQ pork & the pork spring rolls. Both items were amazing. The service was quick & effective."}
{"text":"As a visitor of Cleveland, I walked down E. 4th St debating what to eat before the RHCP concert. Came across Saigon which served beers and---of course vietnamese food.   My bf got a bowl of pho with beef meatballs and enjoyed the pho very much.   We both enjoyed the spring roll esp the sauce.   I also ordered pepper-salted squid for an appetizer--I was pretty disappointed how late it came out. I was already done with my entree and finally the appetizer came out. The actual squid is round-pieces of squid---I was expecting smaller pieces of squid. It was a bit too salty.    For my entree, I got the bun thit nuong with cha gio (extra $2). It was pretty good. I enjoyed the mixture of lettuce, bean sprouts, and the thit (grilled pork) was pretty good.  The host was really friendly and tried to take care of us as much as possible. Our waitress disappeared and was waiting other tables. So the service was pretty lagging. It may have been a busy day for them or bad day for them (short staffed).   Food: Saigon would get 4 stars.  Service: Saigon would get 2-3 stars (from what I experienced)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Saigon's food and service! We have been on multiple occasions and the food is delicious every time:) our favorites are the crispy spring rolls, chicken cabbage salad, Pho w/rare beef and brisket and the salt and pepper chicken.   Saigon has been the perfect setting for a girls night out, date night and is also very family friendly. Tonight we sat outside with our 7 year old daughter and listened to music while enjoying our meal...so much fun!!:)"}
{"text":"I've only recently discovered Vietnamese food so I don't have much to compare this to. I will say that, because of my experience here, I really enjoy Pho and am likely to try it at other places if I am not already dining at Saigon.  Of all the restaurants on East 4th Street, I would say that this one is the least busy, which is not to say that it's not good. I think you have to have a specific desire and palate to eat Vietnamese food, whereas some of the other restaurants have a wider range of cuisine options.  I've been here a few times now, either dine-in or take-out. The first time I came here, I got the rare beef and meat balls Pho. It was the perfect meal because I was strugging with some sinus issues and the jalapeño and siracha sauce cleared me up for a brief time. I'm not a big fan of 'spicy' or 'hot' things, but I would order this again. The spiciness was just enough and it brought out the flavors of all the other elements in the soup.   More recently, I ordered take out from here (very easy and quick process for being on East 4th street). I got the crispy pork roll rice noodles (bun). This quickly went to the top of my favorite list here. The only downside of this dish was that there wasn't enough crispy pork for my liking (it was sooo good, I wanted more).  Prices for entrees ranged between 10-18, pretty reasonable for the area (especially if you are comparing this to it's across-the-street neighbor, Lola). I don't know if they have any famous chefs here, but I think it's worthy of a visit regardless!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed.  Service was slow.  Vegetarian options tasted of meat and fish.  First the veggie spring rolls, tasted of beef, our service person swore up and down it was meat free. The main dish I ordered, a tofu pad thai, tasted of fish.  Service was also pretty slow. I do not think I will be returning."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Vietnamese food and I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  I had one of the soups and some spring rolls which were both great.  I plan on trying much more of their menu.  I am so happy I tried Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Grabbed a quick lunch to go.  The Pho was fantastic.  I got the rare beef and brisket, so good.  If I get back I'm going to try the chicken broth with squid and fish balls.  The whole street is very cool but this place was awesome."}
{"text":"A-ok indeed. Saigon offers a nice spread of Vietnamese food, at slightly above market prices, in a very nice space on East 4th. It's a great spot for carry out (I've never been quoted more than 15 minutes) and the restaurant itself is a good sit down spot with perfect outdoor seating for the summer months. I haven't tried the pho which everyone seems to be up in arms about, but the bun with egg rolls, pork, and shrimp is very good, as are their spring rolls and summer rolls. The chicken cabbage salad is the real standout, with generous portions of fresh chicken, cabbage, and other goodies, with a nice light fish sauce? based dressing. Highly recommend. The stir fry and rice dices are ok, but lacking in flavor compared to some other vietnamese options I've had. Worth a go if you're craving quick and tasty Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place before going to a show at Hilarities. I was hesitant to ever eat here for a couple reasons:  1.  it looks too upscale, which I am not used to when going to have Vietnamese food.  2. It is not full of Asian people (this is something to look for when deciding where to get your best-tasting asian meals!)  I think the reason that it is not full of Asian people because it costs more than you would usually pay down in Chinatown for this stuff. You are definitely paying more for the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant than the food itself, which by the way, is cheap to make.   Either way, the food itself is pretty tasty. I got a Vermicelli noodle bowl with a combo of charbroiled shrimp, an egg roll, and pork. The fish sauce was a little bland to me. It seemed like it was watered down because I had to use more of it (and I'm not a salt fiend by the way).   My bf got some kind of curry rice dish, unidentified. He ordered from the last couple pages of the menu, which seem to be the menu for people who do are not all that familiar with Vietnamese food. I say this simply because I have never seen these items on a Vietnamese menu before....anyway, it was ok. I had a bite of it and it was fine. He said it was just \"ok.\" Not really what you should order here...go for the rice plate, vermicelli, or pho.   The decor in the restaurant is very \"upscale Asian\" and pleasant. The wait staff were great and provided great customer service.   I think I will stick with going to Chinatown when the craving strikes, but I wouldn't oppose stopping in to eat here if I'm in the area for the evening."}
{"text":"Great lunch place, my coworker and I frequent this place during the work week. My favorite appetizer is the:  A02 Gi cun (Shrimp and Pork Rolls) (2) Shrimp, pork, rice vermicelli and lettuce, rolled in fresh rice paper,  served with house special  sauce  and for the entree's I usually go for the:  B3 Bún bò nng (Grilled Beef Vermicelli) Charbroiled beef served with rice vermicelli, fresh lettuce, bean sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, radishes and crushed peanuts  and if its cold outside:   P3 Ph tái bò viên (Beef and Beef Meatball Noodle Soup) Rice noodles with rare beef and beef meatballs  or   M3 Mì hoành thánh xá xíu (Wonton Noodle Soup with BBQ Pork) Egg noodles, shrimp and pork stuffed wontons, and BBQ pork in chicken broth  All the dishes are very good and much like my favorite place back home in Chicago. However, the only thing preventing me from giving this a perfect 5 stars in the price. It seems like prices maybe a little high here, but don't let that scare you away. It's a definite must try."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Food came out very quickly and was very fresh. I had the curry stir fry with squid and it was spectacular. Squid can get a little rubbery if prepared incorrectly and this was NOT the case- it was soft and perfect. My friend had one of the vermicelli dishes and she also enjoyed it (and so did I when I stole a few bites). I will definitely be remembering Saigon and return."}
{"text":"Before the Indians game, we were able to find a local restaurant that wasn't a pub! I should have guessed the vacant tables were an indication that it wasn't the best.   Service - slow, inattentive, and lack luster.   Menu - decent variety of pho, stir fry, and fried dishes. Very few beers, 10+ wines, and multiple cocktails to choose from.   Food - not bad. We had the summer/spring rolls (cold). The sauce was called peanut sauce, but it was hoisin sauce with peanuts on top. We then shared a chicken stir fry. It wasn't bad, but nothing special about it.   Atmosphere - we sat on the patio and enjoyed the weather. Prepare for slow service as the wait staff prefers to stay inside. They allow smoking along the alley, so you'll get smoke drifting through.   If in the area again, I'd skip this place. It isn't bad...but it wasn't fantastic either."}
{"text":"This place is owned by the same people operating #1 Pho, the Vietnamese \"phenom\" in c-town right now. I walked in expecting a bustling and deliciously cheap, upscale version of the same thing. Yet my expectations were promptly drop kicked in the face -- ninja style.  Instead we walked into a completely empty restaurant with mediocre Vietnamese fare. Atmosphere wise, it was a beautiful restaurant. Very moody with nice window seating to keep an eye on E. 4th. But the non-existent clientèle was rather uncomfortable. I waited about ten minutes after sitting down for my drink order to be taken and throughout the meal I had to ask for the dirty plates and glasses to be taken off of the table.  Food wise: Not bad and not great. My appetizer was probably the best part of my meal. Salted scallops with steamed vegetables all covered in a garlic sauce. They were breaded bay scallops, so that was different, but they were yummy. For my entree I ordered the Mì xào chay (Vegetarian Noodles). Basically egg noodles stir fried with assorted vegetables and tofu. That was a mistake, in fact, I was so under whelmed that I couldn't have eaten more than a few bites. My friend reported that he had a good generic sweet/sour tofu dish though. I passed on dessert (four half thought out dishes).   All in all: Not worth a second visit. I think I'll stick with heading over #1 Pho next time I need some Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Nice quiet and cozy atmosphere. The owner or manager (an older gentleman) was social and friendly. Our server was not personable, and never checked if everything was alright. We had no complaints on the food though. Everything came out fast, and delicious. The cabbage salad is yummy. We got it with chicken for an appetizer along with shrimp spring rolls. Spring rolls weren't anything special but still tasted good. We got Chicken Pho and the beef/brisket/meatball Pho for our meals. Delicious pho, tons of flavor. The only thing we didn't like were the meatballs. We've never had Vietnamese meatballs so maybe they're just not our  favorite thing ... But they were gritty, chewy, and had a weird flavor. We would definitely get the chicken pho and just the beef and brisket pho combo.  A nice place on east 4th street, and they have a cute patio too!  Definitely a good place to go for Pho!"}
{"text":"I went here this past weekend before we headed to a Cavs game. Food was great and flavorful, portion sizes are perfect. This place was very busy and the service was slow. They needed more waiters. I had the sweet and sour tofu which came with brown rice...it was an excellent meal."}
{"text":"Great food and absolutely delicious food. I had the tofu spring rolls and vegetable stir fry with egg noodles. The spring rolls came with 2 spring rolls and they were pretty big so very filling. The employees were incredibly kind during my entire visit. The location is convenient and the restaurant is very nice inside. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"For all too long Vietnam has been overshadowed by stories of war and political strife, yet the Vietnam I choose to pay attention to has rich culture & beauty along with a popular form of cuisine that prospers on fresh and seasonal ingredients with balance. When I was recently invited to meet a few friends at the Vietnamese spot on East 4th titled \"Saigon\", I can assure you I was more than willing to partake.   The inside of Saigon is trendy chic. Deep red booths, dark wood furniture and murals along the walls back-lit with a bright blue hue.  The menu was full of traditional Vietnamese offerings. After much debate, I settled for the Bún ch giò, aka: crispy spring rolls served with rice vermicelli, fresh lettuce, bean sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, radishes and crushed peanuts with a side of fish sauce. I thought this dish, served cold, would be perfectly refreshing on such a hot and muggy summer evening, which it was.   Healthy, fresh, flavorful, refreshing and plenty satisfying, I wasn't disappointed. The service was plenty accommodating and the prices, perfectly reasonable. If you're looking for Vietnamese in more of an upscale and elegant space than Superior Pho or #1 Pho, Saigon is that place."}
{"text":"Not terrible. Not great. Don't get the fried tofu - it's not completely cooked.    The service is extremely slow.  After my meal was served I wanted dipping sauce because it was so dry.  My waitress never returned until she brought the bill.  I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Stopped by with my 8 year old daughter for dinner while one night while visiting Cleveland.  The meal was yummy.  I've had better but this place was nice.  As we walked in, my daughter commented on the wonderful aroma in the air!  We ordered 2 apps and a pho.   We started with 2 pork and shrimp summer rolls with a special house sauce.  It was good, I never had it with pork inside.  The Thai basil and mint normally found inside was missing.  I thought the special sauce was mostly watered down hoisin with crushed peanuts on top.  Nothing special.  The lettuce wraps were just sauted shredded chicken and bib lettuce leaves served with a sweet sauce.   We ordered the rare beef pho.  It was serveral slices of thinly rare beef in a bowl of delicious broth and noodles.  Very good.  It was my daughter's favorite part of the meal.  The atmosphere was nice, wait staff was helpful.  They even had coloring books for us to use at dinner."}
{"text":"I don't know about the other dishes, but this place had the worse pho ever! The noodles all stuck together and so did the meat. The boba was horrible as well. To me, it was overpriced crap!"}
{"text":"PHO SHO! As in, pho sho Saigon is one of the top 3 lunch spots in Downtown CLE. It's great for lunch with friends, business meetings, or entertaining a guest. Vietnamese cuisine = YES.  Reasons: - Food is fast, fresh, and filling. - Reasonably priced. - A perfect walking distance halfway point in DT CLE. - Plentiful options for vegetarians and carnivores alike.  You seriously cannot go wrong with their pho, vermicelli, or curry fried noodles. Tip: I recommend going at 12noon, or 12:45/1pm. Anytime in between, you are likely to experience a decent wait. Also, if you're telling someone to meet you there who is not familiar with CLE, make sure you send them the address. There is a Saigon Grille that sometimes pops up on Google... don't send your guest to the wrong place!"}
{"text":"I decided to check out Saigon for dinner after seeing all the good reviews on Yelp  Saigon is located on East 4th Street, right across the alley from Michael Symon's Lola.  I ordered the Goi Con - sans the pork, and an order of Pho Ga. Although they call it something else. For some reason, they call it Pho Ga - a beef broth with chicken. If you want chicken broth with chicken, it's called something else - but the name escapes me at the moment.  The rolls came out first. They don't stock Sriracha sauce on the table, so I had to ask for some - which they promptly brought out. I added some to the peanut sauce - it made for a delicious, rich, spicy sauce - and the rolls were fresh and tasty!  The \"Pho Ga\" then came out, along with the plate of veggies. There was not enough broth in the bowl and not enough bean sprouts, and no Basil. So I asked for more broth, more bean sprouts, and Basil. They brought out more broth, more bean sprouts, and Basil. Apparently they only give you Basil if you order a beef-based Pho.  Odd.  The Pho Ga was good, but not great. The chicken was shredded, and very tender. The noodles were not clumped. They veggies were very fresh. The broth was somewhat on the light side - not as rich and flavorful as some of my favorite Pho Ga's.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"The service and food are better than any other 4 th St restaurant I've been to. Including the famous one across the street.  Spicy lemongrass soup is worth a trip to Cleveland by itself."}
{"text":"Easy to get along with when it's not game day. Inconsistent quality between 2 visits. This place is a solid 4 to 5 though. I'll return."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Phô Ga (chicken) and will always try to find the best spot wherever my travels take me. Today I discovered Saigon and in my humble opinion based on my overall Phô adventures this restaurant rates as one, maybe even The Best Phô around the US. The broth is clear, not greasy and very flavorful. Thin noodles and lots of chicken. A real must.  My second visit \"the same day\" I had summer rolls and lemongrass and chili stir fry with chicken both again very well done and very tasteful. My next visit to Cleveland  I will come back for more."}
{"text":"I like to try Pho and Dim Sum places when traveling to New big cities. This place was right down from the hotel on 4th street. The summer rolls were great. Peanut sauce was a little thin. Had the crepe. Not for me but it tasted well. The Pho was perfect. Great broth. Lots of noodles and beef. Ranks up there with some of my favorites. Nice ambiance. They even have a full bar. Pricing for that area was below normal pricing. Best bang for your buck there."}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from where I work, and it took me only 4 months to get myself in here. (gasp, eye roll)  I had a lunch date here during the Christmas season. It was relatively slow, but I'm sure it was because it was a GHOST TOWN in downtown Cleveland from right before Christmas to right after NY.   I ordered the chicken pho and also got an order of the pork rolls. Both were good, hot, and perfect for a cold day.   I don't believe I would go out of my way to go here outside of it being within walking distance from work, but the food was yummy and the service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"Want delicious pho in downtown Cleveland? Look no further than here! Also if you're getting dinner, make sure to try their cocktails. Sweet but also plenty strong ;) And if you get dessert, make sure to get their fried bananas if you can. I was so sad when they ran out the last time I went :( But the green tea ice cream is also good."}
{"text":"Ordered the Bo Kho (Beef stew noodle soup) Every beef chunk was gristle and unateable.. I doubt that I will ever return"}
{"text":"Have visited again now that I'm eating WFPB and really enjoyed the cabbage salad. I could eat it every single day and never bore of it- it's so flavorful and bright!"}
{"text":"This made me happy.  To be able to have a good dinner that my parents and I enjoyed for around $60 was perfect.    The host/owner just seemed to take pride in showing us to our table, and the wait staff was incredibly pleasant.    The appetizers were delish: though my mom didn't love the crispy porky-shrimpy spring rolls, I did.  The summer rolls were done beautifully and packed full of stuffing, and the crispy rolls had great crunch.  I thoroughly enjoyed the pho...I hadnt had any in a while, and this is what made me fall in love with Vietnamese food.  The basil and bean sprouts on the side were absolutely delish.  Mom had the shrimp and veggies, which was fantastic...not a huge portion, but perfect for her.  Dad had the lettuce wraps...if you're thinking PF Chang's, they're not that, but they were fresh and tasty.    Go here.  They are just simply pleasant, tasty and a great value on a street of pricy options."}
{"text":"Went back for the full bowl of pho. I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. Yes, you get the full forest effect, putting your face close to the bowl and inhaling is like walking through the jungle. You can smell all that fresh flora. But then this has some serious meat. Meatiest. Pho. Ever. Seriously. I ate myself into the slosh-belly zone."}
{"text":"Blue rectangular wall art with scurrying lightening-like stripes swirling through it. Oblong sconces glowing a tender luteofulvous. Square pillars flanking wooden tabletops, some within the pooling natural light and some without, a chiaroscuro of deep, rich woodgrain. And, for the budding voyeur: an elevated dining platform of a kind up front, from which to watch the legion of East 4th passers-by in relative seclusion. Servers, young and more seasoned alike, greet arriving diners graciously, and provide laminated menus which list each dish in Vietnamese and English, respectively. Food arrives fast. The vermicelli with fried tofu is a crisp, sweet standout, a mere $8 at lunch, and well-portioned: it fills its square serving bowl to the brim. Sriracha is available upon request, though none but the most unapologetic heat-gluttons among us will be in need of it. The flavors of Saigon stand alone: delicate but powerful. The vermicelli, while cold, has a welcome luxuriant mouthfeel, and the tofu, cut thin, is anything but chewy. You'll find yourself returning for it again and again. And leaving fulfilled and sated, if not overly so, back through the layers of shadow and light, against the current of the shirt and tie crowd, borne back ceaselessly toward your office building."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! We've been coming here for 5 years now and we love it every time! The owners are amazing as well as their staff! I highly recommend stopping here if you're in town near East 4th street!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today. The lunch menus themselves were peeling apart at the corners. I had ordered a Summer roll but asked if they could not put the lettuce in it. They did. I am not sure if they make them to order or not though. I ordered the only rice item on the menu. It was ok. It was called Co'm rice bowl. You can get it with Steamed jasmine or brown rice, romaine lettuce, cucumbers, scallions, and sweet pickled carrot/daikon served with choice of meat or tofu and house sweat vinaigrette. I got brown rice with Chicken. I ate the vegetables, chicken and a few bites of the rice. The rice tasted like fish so I didn't finish it. If I wanted fish I would have ordered fish. The place was clean and the staff was really nice. I was actually leaving when a coworker hit the corner of the table as I was getting up and a whole glass of pop fell over and onto my pants. Our waitress walked right by and didn't help. So we started to clean it up when a pregnant waitress there stopped and said for us to stop and they would have someone come clean it and apologized for the glass spilling. Wasn't even their fault. She was very nice and concerned which is why they got 3 stars. I'd probably go back and try the dinner menu. Seems like they have more to offer. ** if ur fluffy or pregnant, do not sit in a booth as they're sooo tiny and not breathing room**"}
{"text":"My favorite place on E 4th- I dream about their soup and vermicelli...  M3  Mì hoành thánh xá xíu (Wonton Noodle Soup with BBQ Pork)  Egg noodles, shrimp and pork stuffed wontons, and BBQ pork in chicken broth  $9  B9  Bún ch giò chay (Vegetarian Spring Roll Vermicelli)  Crispy vegetarian spring rolls served with rice vermicelli, fresh lettuce, bean sprouts, carrots, cucumbers, radishes and crushed peanuts  $8"}
{"text":"The rare beef and brisket Pho here is amazing...maybe the best I have ever had. Excellent!"}
{"text":"The most low key little spot on E. 4th and the experience is always excellent. The food is fantastic, the service is swift and attentive, and the atmosphere is clean and comfortable. Everything I've tried here I've enjoyed. Flavorful, colorful, and fresh. They've even gotten me to eat my vegetables, which is a miracle in itself. I highly recommend for a date night or a quick meal with friends before a game."}
{"text":"I love having this in walking distance from my office for lunch. I don't know that I'd make a special trip downtown for it, but it's definitely one of my favorite spots to grab a healthy, tasty midday meal or a pre-game happy hour or dinner. The pho is really great, with tender beef, firm rice noodles, and rich broth. It comes with the standard accoutrements of sriracha, hoisin, bean sprouts, lime, Asian basil and hot peppers that you can mix in and customize your pho. I also recommend the spring rolls or rice paper rolls to start.   Service is always very efficient without feeling like they're rushing you out the door.  Lunch does get crowded. I recommend getting there before noon if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Amazing service! We happened to be in Cleveland during restaurant week and they had a special of coconut curry only when you actually order the special. The waiter right away asked the chef if we can just have the coconut curry and it was no problem. They even said if we didn't like it we could order another dish! Well we LOVED it! Ate the whole thing.   We also ordered the summer rolls and the stir fry rice noodles with shrimp."}
{"text":"SUMMARY: Pretty decent food and efficient service, but menu is basic and the place needs maintenance.  FULL STORY: Stopped by one afternoon on E4th because my friend was craving rice noodles.  It was pretty much empty (but we were there around 2pm, after the lunch crowd).   Cabbage salad was nothing fancy or innovative -- pretty tasty though, cabbage and carrots were crisp, tofu was fried crispy and not too greasy - very pleasant light dressing, and plenty of chopped peanuts.  Iced tea had a strange taste - kind of an artificial lemony flavor.    Service was very quick.  I think the main down-side to this place was that it didn't seem to be maintained very well... cobwebs in the corners, cracks, older-looking furniture, could definitely use a new coat of paint, etc...  and it's a little darker inside than some of the neighboring places where you can enjoy more of the sunshine during the day.  Even sitting near a window at this place felt kind of enclosed.   It was pleasant enough, but I think if they did some upkeep and maybe spiced up the menu, they could compete more with the fun places around downtown.   Note: Looks like they have a couple outdoor tables in good weather!"}
{"text":"I love this place; food is fresh tasting, good service and comfortable seating.  Very nice outside area as well.  I've eaten here numerous times and I've always been very happy with my meal.  Their Pho Noodle soups are outstanding with fresh sides of bean sprouts, jalapeño's, Thai basil and limes.  Nice portion size for the money and very tasty broth.  Their spring rolls are also very good.  I recently tried the shrimp and pork fresh spring roll...very tasty!  For my entree, I ordered the B7...Bún Sàigòn (Saigon Vermicelli).  Crispy pork, shrimp, fried spring roll and veggies over vermicelli noodles.  A dish I'd highly recommend.  Great place for lunch or dinner...I'll be back.  Tip: I believe the happy hour menu is good till 6:00pm...prices are incredible!!!  I ordered the Gi cun (Shrimp and Pork Rolls), you get two with an order, and the  Gi gà (Chicken Cabbage Salad) which was huge along with an ice tea for less than $15 including tip.  Outstanding deal...I've made both dishes at home and can barley do what they do for the same price."}
{"text":"Were this the only Vietnamese place in Cleveland, this would be five stars.  The pho is fantastic, and in huge yet manageable portions.  If you're hankering for an appetizer, go for the salt-baked squid.  They know how to cook it so that it's done, but still tender and with a delicious salty taste.  However, there's #1 and Superior just a short drive away, with ample parking and for substantially less.  When I have to pick a place on East 4th, I pick Saigon.  When I have to pick a Vietnamese place, I go elsewhere.    I'll stress that I've only had good experiences with this place, though, and your results may differ.  It's just that I've had better experiences elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fantastic Vietnamese in a great location. Service was awesome, prices and portions were good. The selection was awesome as well."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese food in downtown . Good  and fast service. Pho with brisket(P2) is my favorite. The place is pretty crowded during lunch(office hours). So make sure you get there early. 11:30 AM is what I felt an ideal time.  Overall I am very satisfied with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'll be back. Period. No questions asked.  The only thing that stops it from getting a full five starts is that the no one ever refilled our waters or asked if we'd like a second beer (they were polite, but outside of taking our orders, bringing the food, and bringing the checks, they never stopped by the table to check in) - something that I may have not noticed as much except that the Phô was spicy enough I wouldn't have minded a little extra water.  That said, they were still polite when they were by, and the food is the big thing here: it was incredible. We had spring rolls (no cabbage in 'em, which I consider a great plus), fried tofu (super hot, gooey on the inside, lightly crispy on the outside, and a nice starter), and Phô. Oh my that Phô.  We were up from Cincinnati for a concert the concept of getting a hotel for the night just so we could get more of the Phô the next day (as opposed to making the trip home that night) was seriously discussed - that good. The place wasn't packed, either - everything else of 4th had a wait of 35-45 minutes, and Saigon was nearly empty when we went in (though it filled up decently while we were there), which, after tasting the food, was hard to understand - again, it was amazing.  The broth, the beef, the meatballs - packed with flavor, tender, savory, spicy. You want to let every bite sit in your mouth forever, and as soon as it's out you want another. The noodles were soft and soaked up the broth perfectly, and the side plate of bean sprouts, jalapenos, and lime let you garnish as you saw fit, as did the side sauces (take a spoonful, add to the spoon, and see what works - we used a bit of it all, but frankly, the Phô stood well enough on it's own it was just trimmings - it didn't need enhancement - though the sprouts helped soak up those last bits of broth).  On top of all that, the portions were very large and reasonably priced (twelve bucks each for  bowls that filled up two pretty big guys who had driven about 5 hours, walked around downtown for a about half and hour, hit the cathedral for mass, and hadn't eaten lunch all day), so even though you leave wanting more for the incredible taste, you don't leave wanting more for the sake of hunger.  Forget what I said about \"next time I'm IN Cleveland\" - if I'm even NEAR Cleveland I'll be back. That good."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 4 for dinner since we had a conference in Cleveland so 4th Street was really packed. It was a nice sit down plus they have Outside seating. I think the menu could be a little more elaborate on describing the food in English for those not familiar with vietnamese food. Nevertheless,  I ordered the charbroiled pork with white rice,  my friends ordered fried rice,  some chicken salad and some seafood noodles.  The food had nice presentation and best of all,  it was delicious! When we got our food,  we were all quiet eating aggressively. And that's how you know the food is good!  I asked my friends what they think of the food and they ask said it was great! Price is the average restaurant price.    The only criticism I have is my friends chicken salad the chicken was very spare and the service time could be better. But it was busy because of a conference in the area, understandable. I absolutely enjoyed the food and would not hesitate to come back!  Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We went there on a game night and we were there early enough, our service was so terribly slow. We were seated at a table around 5:10pm and no one even asked us for drinks till 5:20, which gave us enough time to order food while they took our drinks order, so we did, and we did not get our dinner till 6:15pm! Terrible service, they are way too slow and the restaurant wasn't even as busy when we went in."}
{"text":"You can get a very nice bowl of Pho in Cleveland.  As good as any I've had in NYC.  I chose the brisket and meatball.  My hometown is all growns up, all growns up and all growns up."}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers and realized that it was the first time I was the only Asian in the group, which speaks volumes to the willingness of my Cleveland project team to try new things!  Of course, pho was the #1 thing on all our minds, so we all ordered bowls.  + The rare sliced beef on the pho is legit + Noodles are not overcooked + Broth is flavorful enough + Bbq pork and shrimp spring (soft white wrapper) rolls are a MUST  - Other parts of meat like the tripe and tendon are not as plentiful or high quality as I would expect from a legit bowl of pho  I come to Vietnamese restaurants for one thing only, and that is pho. Rating on the pho alone, I would have to say this place is a solid 4, regardless of the fact that this is downtown Cleveland. Going to check out Pho Superior tomorrow night with the same coworkers so I'll review that when I get the chance :]  Come here for a solid, not too filling, lunch. The location in East Fourth means it's a great bustling lunch location with outdoor seating. And as the weather gets chillier, come here for a hot bowl of the chicken pho!"}
{"text":"Legit Vietnamese in downtown Cleveland. Ain't nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"I come here often. I am biased, but I love Vietnamese food and Saigon is my favorite place to go. I have been on dates here, I have taken friends, family, and significant others, and I have had business meetings here.  My favorite things on the menu are the Salt Baked Squid and Bo Luc Lac. I love the Goi Cuon, Cha Gio and the shrimp egg rolls, too. I have not tried everything on the menu, but I will one day.  The wine list is impressive, and there is a full bar available. The staff is attentive and very friendly. The owner/manager is always on-site, stops by every table, and converses with guests.   I see regulars often, and a lot of people stop in to pick up to-go orders. Saigon is located on East 4th, so pretty much in the heart of Downtown Cleveland.   The only downside is that you have to find parking somewhere since there are no vehicles allowed on East 4th. If you park at Valet and show them your receipt after dinner, you get half of your money back. Or you can find street parking at a meter or park in a garage."}
{"text":"This was very nice.  I was by myself that night, there were not too many people on a Thursday evening. I ordered the \"Rice vermicelli with beef brisket spicy lemongrass soup\" and ordered extra wonton, since someone on here pointed out that they are quite delicious. After ensuring they really make their own wonton, I ordered that, and 4 or 5 wonton appeared and were happily swimming in the red broth. The soup was a bit on the oily side, but it's probably meant to be that way, and it did NOT feel greasy.  It was not too spicy until I confused that jalapeno slice for a wonton and paid for it ;)  The soup was very good and I slurped my way to the bottom while making yummy sounds by myself. Hey, why not??   Another pleasant surprise was the $3 Michelob Amberbock- not the best beer but not bad, and cheap!   I am very pleased about my first Cleveland experience and would come back to try the Pho or anything else really."}
{"text":"This is the first Vietnamese restaurant I have been that has very good pho and an exceptional Manhattan! In addition, my wife loved her sweet and sour soup and Mr 12 year old granddaughter, who seldom likes anything, loved her stir fry. By all means check our this gem on the East 4th restaurant district in Cleveland."}
{"text":"While my wife has several times regaled me with stories of epic Saigon lunches,  last evening was my first visit, and, wow, what an exceptionally impressive first visit it was.   We shared the Scallop rang mui (Salt-baked Scallop) app. If you've never had salt-baked seafood (and I hadn't), you're in for a surprise.  At least it was a major surprise to me. If I'd known it was such a unique and incredible dish I would have made the plunge a LONG time ago. Simply amazing. Sweet and sour and crunch and not-too-salty it was just one of the best things I've tasted in a long, long time.   And that trend continued at dinner. Wifey got the Vietnamese Clay-pot Catfish, described on the menu as \"Catfish simmered with garlic in Vietnamese sauce with a dash of black pepper.\" I got the Lemongrass Squid (pan fried with bell peppers, celery, carrots, onions and spicy lemongrass sauce).   Both were dishes I would order again. And again. And then probably once more before FORCING myself to try other great-sounding menu items.   The decor was simple and elegant, service professional and pleasant, prices reasonable for the location and, all in all, one GREAT dinner. Can't wait to go back and hope you get to try it real soon, too.   Last night Saigon jumped into my Top 10 Cleveland restaurants."}
{"text":"A buddy and I dined here on a Saturday night while in town for a meeting.  It was easy to get a table though all of the booths were taken.  We both had a \"33\" to drink, which was my first Vietnamese beer since visiting Hanoi in '99.  We had a couple of great apps, mine was bo nuong la, and I had bun saigon for my entree.  Everything was tasty and seemed very authentic.  The sevice was great too.  Next time I'm in Cleveland I'll try to pay another visit."}
{"text":"Tasty food, nice service, authentic Vietnamese coffee. I'm giving them four stars because hey, this is Vietnamese food, it's supposed to be cheap, and at this place it's definitely not."}
{"text":"Let me first preface this review by saying that I have grown up with a best friend whose family moved from Vietnam only a few years before she was born, and I have spent countless meals at their home through the years. Also, I used to live in Sandusky and frequented an authentic Vietnamese restaurant called MeKong (go there!).   So, this place. Unimpressive. The menu is small, the portions are small for what the price point is, and the flavor is small. Paying $17 for 6 boiled shrimp in broth with uncooked onions and a scoop of white rice is laughable. The service was fine, but I won't be running back."}
{"text":"Ugh this is one of those places that I could eat here every single day and never get sick of it. I love their patio on East 4th, I love their delicious Vietnamese dishes and I love that it's so close to my work so lunch dates here are always a must. I would totally give this place 5 stars but the service kinda misses the mark. We waited awhile before our server came over to us to greet us and we waited even longer for him to come get our check. However, this place is still freakin' awesome!"}
{"text":"Fried spring rolls were amazing and the sweet and chilli sauces were too good.. The stir dried noodles are amazing too.. If you like Asian cuisine then this is a place to be..  Tip: don't mistake it to be like Chinese food as the flavors and preparation is different"}
{"text":"I had lunch with a friend at Saigon recently and I have to say, the food wasn't as I expected. It was different than other Vietnamese restaurants that I have dined in. The food was good, but it seemed Americanized. I ordered chicken and rice with a side of veggies. The quality of the food was very good.  I poured my container of fish sauce on the dish and stirred it up. Doing that made the dish. Without the fish sauce, this dish would've been tasteless.  I enjoyed the texture and flavor of the rice.  The chicken had a funky, unseasoned flavor.  They need to work on that.  I'll probably be back to try something else, but if you can't get chicken and rice right, the return trip isn't deserved."}
{"text":"A few friends wanted to meet for lunch downtown and we are so glad we went here.  The location is a quick walk from Public Square in the trendy East 4th Street closure.  One disclaimer about parking: I parked at the 100 Public Square lot for a little over an hour and had to pay $11.  I was told by the friends I met that live downtown that this is the normal price range for the area, but it caught me off guard.  If you are looking for some authentic audial/Viennese food this is your stop.  The service was quick and the restaurant smelled delicious from the moment we walked in.    I'm a huge Pho lover and was excited to try this places recipie.  I was pleasantly surprised that there was a Leon grass flavor which worked well wht the broth ad that the spice level was chose your own with the spices they brought out with our meals.   I ordered the chicken and it was pulled, moist and flavorful.  The others in our group got the cabbage salad and the rice dishes.  They said it was good but their chicken was dry.  I tried to finish my entire meal but it was so much that I got to take some leftovers home as well (which is fantastic because I got to eat it later too!!).  I'm new to the downtown places to eat in Cleveland when I come visit my parents but would be happy to come back to eat sometime soon."}
{"text":"Ugh. I dont know why the lunch menu was so limited. The food was tasteless, the waitress was, well lets not say.  she told us they had 3vegetables. There was absolutely no seasoning -could have been in any chinese take out. Loml's pho was average."}
{"text":"The manager here is a cool guy.  I like when he is the person sitting guests and bringing the check, etc.  The rest of the staff was just ok- we sat for a while waiting for water refill and dishes to be taken.  The food is better than average, and it has all the right Vietnamese essentials.  I highly recommend the combination Bun, it's really good: pork spring roll, roasted pork, shrimp, rice noodles, sweet chili vinegar sauce, lots of vegetable garnishes and peanuts.  The pho is good too.  Outside seating is a nice plus.  The only drawbacks for me were the price (although higher prices should be expected in that area) and the atmosphere is a little blah.  But a nice place for someone craving Vietnamese in downtown CLE"}
{"text":"Shrimp cabbage salad appetizer, rice paper rolls with pork, and beef Pho soup were all delicious.  Nice bottle of Paso Robles red wine.  Excellent service by Julie.  Always good food and service at this great spot on East 4th Street."}
{"text":"I read some of the other reviews, and I gather the major complaint is that this restaurant does not have good pho or not as good as some other restaurants.  Well, I did not order the pho, but ordered the vegetarian spring roll over rice vermicelli instead, and it was pretty awesome.  The dish is a cold dish, which was to my surprise.  There was radishes, carrots, cucumbers, and crushed peanuts.  The sauce was the key to the dish.  I dumped the entire mini-bowl of sauce and mixed it up.  Oh yummmmmmmm it was.  It's a perfect dish to eat in the summer time when it's super hot outside.  The dish was refreshing, light, and tasty!  Too bad I'm leaving Cleveland tomorrow or else I may drop by to have it again :)  Service was descent.  They sat us down quickly, and in a blink of an eye our dish was placed in front of us.  The servers were pretty friendly, and I didn't have any problems with them.  We got in early around 11:30am; however, by noon, it was packed full and a line was forming.  Go early!"}
{"text":"I ordered beef brisket pho and the taste is just not good. It has that cinnamon taste that I feel I am drinking Starbucks. The table also doesn't seem so clean. The food does not really match with the price."}
{"text":"Saigon, I wanted to love you...but your servers, when they're around...stink.  My friend and I were looking to drop some $$ on dinner and drinks.  We started with wine and 2 apps, summer rolls and chicken lettuce cups, which were tasty.  Then our server zoomed by and I asked her for more wine.  She said, \"Water?  Sure.\"  And zoomed off.  She came back with (odd-tasting) water and zoomed off before we could stop her.  So we sat...and sat...getting hungry again...with only water.  Finally she returned and we told her we wanted our check.  That came quickly so we paid, departed, and spent money on food elsewhere.  I'm not going back."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure that I liked Vietnamese food.  Ages and ages ago, I went to  wonderful Vietnamese restaruant in Rochester, NY called Mamasan's and fell in love.  When I left Rochester, I went to a few takeout places trying to find the same thing and was horribily dissapointed.  The food was't subtle, but covered in excessive amounts of fish sauce.  Will the real Vietnamese food please stand up?  And then came Saigon.  Here were the light, fresh flavors I remembered.  Delightful rice paper wrapped shrimp rolls were stuffed with rice vermicelli, veggies and spiced pork and accompanied by hoisin sauce and peanuts.  My pho was subltey spicy.  Mon cher chou's melange of noodles, chicken and raw veggies with a vinegary dipping sauce was light and refreshing.  The atmosphere is elegant and beautiful, bamboo and deep red, without being even slightly kitschy.  The service is polite and friendly, although we did have trouble getting refills, possibly because it was so busy.  So, I am not sure if this is the real authentic deal, but it is really, really tasty.  It has completely reignited my interest in the cuisine."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us came to Saigon for dinner since we had a mix of carnivores, vegetarians and vegans. Everyone got something they enjoyed.  I got the Pho which was great."}
{"text":"Saigon is one of my favorites, even though I never deviate from the same exact order... I always get vegetarian spring rolls to share and the egg noodles with tofu and veggies, which is astoundingly delicious - the tofu tastes like fried chicken! It is probably the least healthy meal they serve, but might also be the most delicious!!  In the winter, I find myself wishing for a vegetarian pho option... But I could get nothing but the same noodle dish there forever and be happy!!  The service is great, too!! Even during busy lunch hours, we are usually seated, served and paid up within 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"Love it.  Surprised it's always nearly empty considering the food is great and reasonably priced compared to the other nearby restaurants. Pho is fab and fried bananas are delish"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat downtown. The food is amazing, inexpensive and fast. Best pho in the city."}
{"text":"I'm a business traveler that has been in Cleveland for the last six months. I've eaten out a lot here. A lot. I've eaten at Saigon dozens of times, for lunches and dinners. There are many great food options in Cleveland but Saigon beat them all to become my default restaurant in the area.  Here's what else kept me coming back, over and over again.  1.   The food, duh. It has never failed me. Ever. I've eaten at more at Saigon than at Chipotle in the past year... that says a lot. The charbroiled pork rolls have become a staple of my diet. The pho is awesome for cold days or for getting over a cold (or hangover). The chicken cabbage salad is amazing and I hate salad! I have no idea if any of this is authentic, but it's damn tasty.  2.   The food is healthy! I'm no nutritionist, but my waistline and general well-being says that Saigon (for restaurant food) is actually decent for you. If you are especially ambitious, replace the vermicelli or rice with any combination of mixed veggies, lettuce, or sprouts.  3.   Service is incredibly efficient. Food comes out quickly. Waitstaff don't take notes but never forget orders, even in large parties with a ton of substitutions and special requests. Sometimes I even try to confuse them with orders like \"Saigon vermicelli, no vermicelli\" but they never mess up!  Bottom line: Maybe not the choice for a special once-a-year fine dining night, but for every other occasion -- especially when there is no occasion -- Saigon is the place to go in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"The interior was very nice and seemed fancy. I am assuming that this keeps the suits happy during their lunch meetings. I thought the food was just aight. If you are downtown and want some pho and are on foot this is the only option. If you have time, money for the bus or a car, it is worth going down to Asia Town. Tell the bus driver \"Won't you take me to...Asia Town?! Won't you take me to...Asia Townnnnnn\" and he may uppercut the hell out of you!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite lunch spot in downtown! And probably many others as well seeing as how they are continually busy. So arrive early or late in the lunch hour to skip the wait. Wow, that rhymed.   Anyways, saigon is simply one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Cleveland at least from this foodies prospective.   The service is always quick and the food is always hot and tasty. Their pork summer rolls are outstanding and the rare beef and brisket pho is out of this world! The broth is so flavorful and they give you plenty of bean sprouts, basil, jalapeño and lime plus the hoisin and sriracha is brought right to the table.   If you want a sweet treat before or after your meal you can't go wrong with the green tea bubble tea or the iced Vietnamese coffee.   Note - they have happy hour staring at 3pm with select app and menu items half off!"}
{"text":"It was good. I had my usual chicken curry. It was no more special than the last chicken curry I had elsewhere, but the portion of fresh veggies and chicken was a good size. White or brown rice option. I went right after work so the service was fast, but long enough so you knew they were making your order fresh. Nicely, but simply decorated inside; I'm not sure it says Vietnamese to me, but it's calming."}
{"text":"The pho was above average. I'm picky with Vietnamese food since I studied in Vietnam. The noodles were a little undercooked (just a tiny bit). The service was great and the location is awesome. Great people watching spot!"}
{"text":"is this place a joke.  terrible pho. Tasted no authenticity whatsoever. ID'ed every single one of us, including my bosses who look at least 35. Stirfries were unedible - worse than chinese take out honestly. Bunch of flies flying around, slow service, terrible food.   come on."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place and It was not bad but definitely no  wow factor...they only offer one size and it is small then also there is no extra napkins or salt or pepper on the table ..the service was fast and the waitress was nice but only came by once then disappeard on me..."}
{"text":"Disappointing food. Not flavorful at all. Really bland and dry. Had to dump a bunch of soy sauce and sriracha sauce to even get the food down. Atleast staff is nice and water was good."}
{"text":"The service was quick, food came out fast  & was super hot. We tried Chicken rolls & The basil  chicken  fried rice  is the best in CA."}
{"text":"My friends and I were visiting from California and were looking for authentic pho. The pho and appetizers were delicious and we received great service."}
{"text":"Please provide the side of sprouts/lime/basil/cilantro to each customer vs one plate per table. Add more seafood pho/mi selection on menu..as well as cha gio and crispy tofu with lemon pepper sauce (dau hu chien gion)."}
{"text":"I had a bad cold and all I wanted was a huge bowl of brothy soup.  So I came here for the pho.  The restaurant had a modern design and it was probably the nicest and cleanest looking Viet restaurant I have ever been to.  The shrimp/pork spring rolls and they were dry and flavorless even with the plum sauce.  The pho broth was really salty, and had a slight sweetness to it.  I had trouble finishing the broth.  Basil was wilting and not very fresh.  However, the beef slices were very fresh and tender.  Nothing tops Chicago's own Tank Noodles' pho!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. It had a quiet, relaxed atmosphere and our server was incredible!  I'd picked out the vegetarian soup and she recommended that I get the Hot & Sour version, which I did. I was glad too, because it was delicious, brimming with fresh veggies and delicious flavors.  We went for dinner and it wasn't too crowded, and the service was prompt, in addition to being helpful!"}
{"text":"This place is an authentic Vietnamese cuisine and it's by far one of he best places I've been to! Very nice design on the inside and looks visually appealing from the outside! Management is nice. Well run restaurant."}
