{"text":"Decent Indian food. Not incredible, but not bad, either.  I usually go for the lunch buffet ($8.95/person) since shelling out $50+ for a decent dinner for two doesn't give me the food for value I can get elsewhere in town.  As someone else mentioned, they have a late-night 1/2 off deal, but unless you want to eat dinner around midnight, it doesn't make too much sense.  Nothing stands out in my mind as a \"must have\" or \"to die for\".... But, on the flip side, nothing is a \"must miss\", either."}
{"text":"Food was great...but they use msg...so tell them no msg or you will wake up the next day with an MSG headache."}
{"text":"My husband and I had excellent service and food on a Friday night. We were greeted and seated in a timely manner and the owner spoke with us - was very attentive and explained some dishes and customs with us. We received excellent garlic Naan and the cilantro jalepeno sauce was wonderful. We recommend the shrimp masala and lamb korba. Samosa appetizer is a must. We were offered a dessert and promised if we didn't like it, another dessert of our liking would be brought out. We were also brought Chai tea after the meal that was delicious. Big thumbs up for food and service. The restaurant offered the quiet informal ambience we were looking for away from our toddlers - but still a lovely enough place that did not feel likeI a fast food or strip mall establishment...far from! The pricing was also very fair. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've ever had.  I can't remember exactly what I had because I asked our waiter for a recommendation and went with it.  I think it was the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was great.  Same goes for the Lamb Curry my friend ordered.  I also think that you order every dish on a hot scale of 1-10 (10 being the hottest).  The cilantro chutney was really hot, which our friendly waiter informed us is a 7.  That convinced me to opt for a hotness of 5 for my main course.  It was perfect.  Unlimited rice to go along with your meals.  Large menu.  Nice staff who kept our drinks topped off.  Nice restaurant on the inside too.  Will probably go back this weekend."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fantastic. Spice levels weren't off the charts spicy. Large portions of food, which is definitely a plus. Not priced too poorly. Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"This place is the best Indian restaurant in Northern Ohio. Their meat is supplied by my friend's family's deli, and it's all organic. The waiters are as nice as can be. And don't forget about the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"This place is great.  I'm a vegetarian so I can't comment on the meat dishes, but the vegetarian chili is one of the best Indian dishes I've ever had.  The other veg dishes are good, but that one's on another level.  They have a lot of 50% off specials and a nice buffet too.  The decor is nice-- they play Indian music videos, it's a fun atmosphere good for late night similar to the other restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian places to go on the west side (rivaling Udupi in Parma).  The staff is a very good, most of which have seem to have recently come from India.  We were helped by a lovely young woman working on her masters at CSU.  The owner is great and oversees everything.  He is happy to help modify your perfect meal, (I like it EXTRA hot, and they deliver).  Expect entirely too much rice with your meal.  Sadly. their wine list is mediocre and overpriced."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening around 7:30 with a party of 5 other girls, the place was extremely busy but as we had called ahead we did not have to wait for a table for very long.  This was my first time at an Indian restaurant in general and I have to say that o was very happy.  The food was amazing very flavorful and a good portion.  My sister and I shared an order of Dum aloo, which came with rice;  We also ordered 1 tandori naan and split it.  We ate till we we're full and still had some to take home with us.  The two of us ate and we're satisfied in total for about $18.00.   I will mention that I gave this place 4 out of 5 stars simply because we had a rather long wait, it was nearly an hour before we got our food.  However, it was totally worth it and I will be back in the future."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant, we go every chance we get. The food is amazing and the staff is delightful!"}
{"text":"This past Sunday I got a group of friends to join me at India Garden for a birthday celebration/dinner. With vegan and meat dishes available, their Sunday dinner buffet was a perfect choice for all of us! The buffet features many of their signature dishes and is an excellent choice for newcomers who want to try out a handful of items at a low price. Be wary though! The level of spice in each dish varies and you can accidentally pick up something a little out of your heat range. Overall I would definitely recommend it.   Although the buffet was good, I would say that the real heart of India Garden is it's extensive menu. I'm not sure how long it would take to try one of everything, but it would be a ride on a rainbow of flavor.  New comers to Indian food should stick to anything with their Masala sauce on top and an order of garlic naan bread on the side. One thing not many people have mentioned is their Mumtaz Paneer Kulcha. A flat bread stuffed with cheese and spices that is super awesome. The only bad part about such a menu is that choice overload can force you to stick to the same thing instead of taking the risk of trying something new. While it can be difficult to choose there is much reward to diversification.  My only complaint, as others have said, is the service. I've had meals with great service, and meals where I've only had my water refilled once in the beginning (which you will need). My advice would be to not worry about seeming rude and using \"different methods\" to gain their attention. Although you should not have to do this at a restaurant, it may be due to their culture so I cannot say whether they mean to be rude or not. Walking into India Garden is like stepping into a teleporter to India. The hipster inside of you will ironically enjoy the Bollywood music videos even if you have no clue what is going on.  Overall, I would say walking out of India Garden you will feel full, satisfied, and glad you went."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go out ! All of the employees were very pleasant the moment I walked in. The food was delicious, filling, and more than enough. The vibe of the restaurant  sets off a great mood. I come here all the time. Definitely an amazing place to eat. Not a thing on the menu that isn't delicious. You will not regret choosing to eat here!!"}
{"text":"Great ambience and interesting crowd. Was extremely busy but good service. I wanted to really like this pkace but the food was just average. Nothing to distinguish it from any other indian restaurant! I am Indian and this food catered more for non- Indians. Food was spicy but lacked salt and flavor. Disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Has a bar in it too!!  Could be a little cleaner and tables need to have the \"stickiness\" off of them. Good experience and food is excellent. Would go back again for sure."}
{"text":"I have been dragged here on numerous occasions.  Pros: - Alcohol.  They have it (though good luck in getting it in a timely manner). - Location.  For Pitt students, it's easy to get to.  Cons. - Service.  Slow and unfriendly.  This is every time I've gone but I'll tell you about the most recent.  The sign outside mentioned a beer special.  When we got in we asked for the beer special to which we were told there was none.  We asked about the sign then and the server consulted with someone else and said we were right.  When the check came we were still charged full price. - Food.  Let me preface this by saying I don't typically like Indian food.  However, I have had it at times where I thought it was good.  India Garden was never one of those times.    Verdict: One of my least favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh.  It's not worth going to thanks to the poor service and food that can't even be classified as mediocre."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place to anyone!! Prices are very fair and the food exceeded expectation! The place is small and quaint and the service was very good, very nice staff. Food came out hot and didnt take too much time even though the place was busy."}
{"text":"I love their food quality and even when they offer half off, they do not compromise on the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing service I've experienced in Arizona.  My 4 year old niece accompanied my sister and I and they bent over backwards to make sure she was happy with her lunch.  They offered lots of things for her to try. We ate at the buffet and tried everything, very very good.  And the mango lassies are excellent.   GO GO GO!"}
{"text":"This is a local favorite for me and especially my girlfriend. The food is very flavorful and most orders leave enough to take home for a second meal. They can crank up the spiciness as hot as you want, and then some. The staff are attentive and I've never wanted even for a water refill. The crackers and spicy sauces they provide are a good starter, but the garlic naan is even better. It costs up to maybe $16/entree (for the tandoori options) but considering you'll probably have leftovers it's really not bad at all. Yum yum."}
{"text":"This is a good Indian restaurant. The food tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"$9.95 lunch buffet from Monday to Sunday. Usually weekends is slightly expensive but this place 7 days for the same price.  Service is very good.  Keep asking us if we need more naan.  8 entrees choice can choose from including chicken, goats and veggie.  Also serving dessert, soup and chai tea.  With this amount, it can't hardly go wrong."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and even better service!  I strongly suggest trying the lunch buffet! So many great flavors for $10!"}
{"text":"This place is still excellent!  We ate the Tiki Chicken Masala... So good I almost can't get enough! Every time we go it seems really empty. I hope it picks up! They do need to train the water girl about the menu. She never seems to know what anything is! Lol. But that won't stop us from going. Next we are going to try the buffet."}
{"text":"I ate here a little while ago and I can't say that the experience was very satisfying overall. I will admit that the food was tasty. I favored the chili chicken over most else. The sauce had the  combination of sweet and spicy and the chicken was cooked very well. They also had a delicious array of sauces made to top the fluffy breads that they offer. However, the food lost some of its rich flavor as I started looking more around the room. With the hand prints covering the door and mirror near the entrance, 'stuff' on the floor, and a bus pan of dirty dishes near the buffet area, I can't bring myself to consider this place clean. Unfortunately, the lack of cleanliness isn't this restaurant's only turn off. The staff also needed some work. Rather than being welcomed to the restaurant, I felt as if I were intruding on a private party. The wait staff were very short with me and showed me that they wanted to spend the least amount of time possible talking with me. I can't say that I will ever return to India Garden due to all of this."}
{"text":"It was the first time for us in Cleveland and according to the previous review this was a good restaurant. So we decided to have dinner  at this restaurant.  Order:          -Chicken tikka masala         -Chicken biryani         -Nan         -Samosa         -Yogurt         -coke   Pro:         -staff are friendly         -Order was fast         - We got welcomed instantaneously  Cons:         -Place is very old and outdated          - masala: I love and I cook indian food. Never in my life I have tried a masala as bad as this one. It was burned and the taste was really bad it really difficult to describe it. To hide such a bad taste, they put a lot of chillies. (4/10)          -biryani: even biryani tasted really bad. It was very cold. Full of raw onions, rice is really mushy. No indian flavor what so ever. ( 3/10)          -samosa: I did not try it. But my wife told  me it was good         -Price: was unreasonably high. Also they charge us for raita but what we got was just plain yogurt and when asked him he said both are THE SAME PRICE.  I am truly disappointed with the quality of the food. The staff seems  really kind but they can find a better recipe to make their popular dish \"masala\".  Last comment: the one who picked up the dishes asked me how was the food???? I told him IT WAS OK, and he said \"EXCELLENT!!!!\"   I don't know why some restaurants do not read and act upon the review available on yelp and other places,,,"}
{"text":"Oh India Garden how i love this Indian restaurant probobly the best one in the pittsburgh area yet, this is the one and ONLY indian cuisine place i go to for there awesome buffet and there delightful tikka massala wither its shrimp or chicken your never disappointed. but alas all good things have an end, recently they been kinda slaking so i wondered and asked our manager why does out food taste less.... tasteful... he explained to me and get this!... there head chef takes a break on mondays which is out \"indian food night\" for us.   and another thing i started noticing is that it u order from a scale of 1-10 on how hot your food is its always a gamble u never how how exactly spicy your food is gonna get unless u tell them BURN ME 10/10"}
{"text":"I used to go there almost every week for launch, delicious food! And very nice staff, orders were delivered timely and always with a smile. They have daily buffet for launch for 10 dollars per person. Highly recommend if you like Indian food"}
{"text":"Best Indian Buffet around Pittsburgh. On sunday it's even better with lots of awesome extras. They have been consistently awesome for years. This place is great!!! Friendly service, fresh food and D-Freakin-Licious!!! The chilli chicken is so good!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place, the food is great and the service is awesome! We ordered from the menu and the kids love the tandoori chicken and of course the naan bread! Yum! Highly recommend this place if you love indian food! :o)"}
{"text":"I decided to visit this Indian restaurant near my home in Lakewood because of the Yelp reviews I read and the fact that the parking lot was always full of cars. I use the theory that the majority has it right.   I arrived at the beginning of the dinner hour and was promptly greeted and seated by the waiter. The water explained the menu and the level of spiciness. One problem I had was reading the menu as the room was so dark it was hard to read the menu. I ended up ordering the Mango Curry Chicken which came with Basmati Rice. The waiter asked if I wanted any Naan, so I ordered the Onion Naan. I had Iced Tea to drink with my meal. I wasn't at all disappointed with my meal which tasted wonderful. The wait staff was very much on the ball and refilled my tea at least 2 times during my meal. Even the Tea was special and tasted great. The waiter said it had special spices in it. For dessert, based on the waiters recommendation, I had the Gulab Jamun, which is a North Indian treat, deep fried milk dough balls, served hot in a sweet syrup. My dessert was very yummy and I savored every bite. Overall I was very pleased with my meal and would definitely return."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight, for the first time.  It will not be our last.  The owner is such a nice guy and the food was great!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food and the service! The co-owner who catered our wedding came to greet us AND took care of our 9 month old. Talk a about family-friendly restaurant! We are from San Francisco and when visiting AZ we will definitely be stopping here for exceptional food and service!"}
{"text":"Undercooked crunchy rice at the buffet, the last time I was there.  Sadly enough, I think that will be the last time I visit there.  Not to mention waiting 10 mins or more for naan (I thought it was just that one time we went, but it became habitual the past few times I have been there). Come on, it's an Indian buffet, who has to wait for naan at a buffet??  It's like Ike with no Tina (haha), Martin with no Gina...you get my drift.   The workers there were decent though...pretty good at filling the glasses and all."}
{"text":"Setting: Small, intimate restaurant but doesn't feel crowded inside. They just recently added an outside patio.  Food: Delicious with tons of meat-filled and meatless options. Also, every day for lunch they have a great buffet where you can taste a variety of different dishes and everything is well-marked so you know what you're getting yourself into.  Service: Easily some of the most friendly and helpful waitstaff I've encountered.  If you like lamb, get the Keema Naan - it's delicious."}
{"text":"Outstanding food.  Garlic naan was amazing.  We ordered Tikki  Masala chicken and lamb in which both were incredibly flavorful.  Would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Great Service and Great Food.  Have done dinner and the lunch buffet.  Dinner a bit pricier but food can be spiced up if your so inclined, lunch is a good deal but moist of the dishes are spiced medium."}
{"text":"I gave India Garden 5 stars because it is 'as good as it gets' anywhere in northern Ohio.  Consistent, flavorful and reasonably priced.  The menu is extensive with A great selection of vegetarian items to go along with the traditional meat items like chicken, lamb and even Goat.   The vegetable pakoras are fantastic, not too oily or heavy. Great breads also. I do prefer my food to be extremely spicy and this restaurant can bring the heat if you ask for it. The buffet is worth the $9 if your into community eating. This is the best Indian food around if not one of the better restaurants period."}
{"text":"Had dinner and was disappointed to say the least. I ordered a Mango Lassi and it surprisingly tasted a lot like Mango Kefir which I enjoyed. It was strangely not very cold perhaps it isn't supposed to be.  I ordered Chicken Tikka on an onion sizzler. When it came out it was sizzling and I was excited to try it. I ordered it \"spicy\" and it came out very bland. The chicken was so hard and over done that I suspect it had been cooked earlier and reheated and then placed on the very hot cast iron pan. Very disappointing.  Then to add insult to injury I was asked whether I wanted rice or naan with my chicken Tikka. I choose rice and it had also been previously cooked and barely reheated and I was charged an additional $2.99 for this rice which I erroneously assumed was included with the meal.  Charge more if you must but don't make the meal seem miserly  by nickel and diming to get a complete entree.  The setting was pleasant and comfortable. The service was good and for that I gave the second star not for the food."}
{"text":"How in the world does this place have 4 stars?  I feel like I'm in grade school again and its opposite day.  Because this place is the opposite of \"yay! I'm a fan\".  (I'm not a fan.) I have been to several Indian buffets (not locally) as well as traveled through India for a month.  Now granted, nothing is going to really compare to the food I had while actually in India because the flavors there were just as vibrant as the colorful surroundings but India Garden might as well have hamburgers on their menu for as authentic as the food was.  I went for the lunch buffet and its placed in this weird, unlit area.  There are only a few things offered and none that I tried were good.  I know buffets have to be careful about adding to much spice so that they can accommodate varying taste buds but I felt like I was eating a marinara sauce.  The naan bread was decent and brought to you table side.  The rice was average.  I mean..its rice... My only guess is that because there seem to be so few Indian restaurants around here people don't know what they're missing.  If you have ever had good, flavorful Indian food, don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"India Garden's has the best Indian food in town! They have a great buffet or ala carte menu and they can customize it to whatever your taste is. Their restaurant is extremely clean and has a great atmosphere. They also offer a banquet hall and they will work with you on the decor and take care of everything for you. The owners take pride in their business, and it really shows when you go to eat there. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to eat some yummy Indian food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian place. The staff is always so friendly and the food is delicious. There are many vegetarian choices."}
{"text":"I've been on an Indian food kick recently and have wanted to try this place for a while. My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday and were surprised to see at least 6 groups of diners entering while we were eating. Not quite a hidden gem when everyone knows about it. We ended up getting paneer tikka, chicken tikka masala, and garlic naan. I enjoyed the paneer tikka, but would not get it again. I ordered the spice level at a 6, and could not distinguish any heat at all. Ditto for my boyfriend, who also complained his chicken tikka masala was tough. The naan was the best part of the meal. Waiters were extremely attentive, nearly to the point of hovering. Overall, it wasn't horrible, but I wouldn't make a special trip back."}
{"text":"I am extremely thankful that there is a good Indian food restaurant in the west valley!  Overall, the food at India Garden is very good.  I have tried the buffet a couple times, and also gotten take out probably half a dozen times.  The buffet is solid, but unspectacular.  Maybe not quite up to the level of some of the better options in Tempe/Phoenix. However, it is priced right & the quality is good.  The regular menu items are better, in my opinion.  However, things do get a bit expensive when you add up the entree, the rice, and the bread all as separate charges.  ***PRO TIP*** - you can cut down the bill a little by using the coupon on their website, just pull it up on your phone & show them!!!  My favorite dish on the menu is the Chicken Makhani.  Butter chicken is one of my favorite Indian dishes, and India Garden does it right!  The tandoori chicken pieces are delicious & the gravy is super rich.  I have also tried the Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo, Saag Paneer, & Muttar Paneer.  All of them are very good.  If you like Indian food & live in the West Valley, this place is worth checking out & saving yourself a trip across town when the curry cravings come calling!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. They make fresh naan for you, and their food is fantastic. Try their mango lassie drink! Their lunch buffet is a wonderful deal! I would definitely recommend India Garden."}
{"text":"The half-off lunch and dinner menus are my favorite. While you can't order anything on the menu, you get a huge selection, much larger than what other restaraunts offer for half-off hours. And everything is authentic. Always lots of music and cricket or Bollywood videos on TV. Great place for group and family outings; I always see groups there and it looks as though everyone is having a great time. And the presence of large groups doesn't seem to overwhelm the restaraunt. Food, drinks, refills, and anything else we need always comes quick and prepared to perfection."}
{"text":"Went here for Lunch. This place is in a run down strip mall and the only reason we decided to go here was cause we were starving. Should have eaten at Chick Fil A instead which is quite close to this place.  The food was pathetic.  Lamb / Mutton was chewy and tasteless Chicken 65 was the worst I have ever had Chicken Makhani gravy was tasteless and it was too watery So am recommend every one don't go any more."}
{"text":"I loved the food, just sitting hear thinking about  it makes me hungry. I took my parents out for a treat as they don't eat out much at restaurants. We all ordered different dishes Shahi Chicken Biiyanis, Karahi lamb laajwaab, mumtaz garden chicken. We did not leave one piece on the plate it was all so delicious. We got all of our orders mild as we don't eat too much spicy food at all, but for me who is the most sensitive eater in the family I got a Mango Lasi which helps relieve any spice and just taste oh so good.   I can't wait to take my fiance to eat there as well, as me and my parents have been bragging how good the food is there."}
{"text":"I've wanted to come here for quite a while. Tidat the stars aligned! It was lovely food served by the gentlemen.  :-) at the first mouthful of Kihari shrimp, my tastebuds were singing...oh yes! !"}
{"text":"Visiting my hometown -- I heard great things about this spot. I tried a few if our family's favorites / regulars via takeout - Chicken tikka masala, Chicken makhani, Saag Paneer, naan, samosas.  First, the rice was undercooked, grainy and dry - not a stylistic or regional deviation. Rice is a fundamental part of the cuisine and this rice wasn't right.   The other dishes suffered from totally inconsistent spice levels vs what was ordered (some spicier, some milder than ordered on their 1-10 scale). The chicken was fair - but all the curries were quite watery and thin. Saag paneer had more onion than either saag or paneer. The nan and samosas were unremarkable.  Myself and my family all agreed this was far from what we had expected based on the reviews and our experience at many other Indian restaurants in Ohio.   Not recommended."}
{"text":"The people are great at this establishment and so is the food.  I just started eating Indian a few years back and won't go anywhere except here.  I highly recommend the chicken tiki masala (sp?) with naan if you are new to Indian food!"}
{"text":"This was my first time in and will absolutely be back. We arived close to six, and we're sat right away. Crispy flat bread with two sauces are brought to the table as well as ice water.   One sauce is green, it's spicy and a little bitter. I liked it very much. The other sauce is sweet and tangy, also very good.  For a starter we order the paneer pakora, it arrived quickly and was nicely fried. Tasted well but could have used a hint of salt.   For our mains I ordered the lamb Madras with rice medium heat, and my husband ordered the tandoori chicken. Also the garlic naan.  Our food arived fast and smelled and looked great. Most impressive was the huge sizzling plate of tandoori chicken and onions. The chicken was very well cooked and came easily off the bone.   My lamb was well seasoned and cleaned well. The rice was cooked well and has nice flavor, the only thing I would have changed was the heat next time I will order hot and not medium.   The wait staff was attentive but not over bearing nor neglecting. I hope to eat there again soon and try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"India Garden serves decent Indian food at reasonable prices.  It's menu is extensive, and like many Indian restaurants I've been to, they tailor their dishes according to your individual spice-tolerance (a plus for people who can't handle the hotness).  However, the service can be unfriendly and very slow, especially during their late-night hours.  They turn up the volume on the music, making it difficult to hear conversation, and I've also noticed that their meal portions get smaller during late-night as well.  There can often be a considerable wait after 11pm, especially for larger groups.  Despite this, it is a good place to go for cheap Indian, and a good alternative to some other half-price options in Oakland."}
{"text":"Great food masala could have a little more Flavor but it's about 7 of 10 so not to bad"}
{"text":"One of the servers is horrible and was very rude to us. The server charged us gratuity without telling us. Other than that the staff is excellent and the food is also good."}
{"text":"Very pleased with the decor and cleanliness of the restaurant.  The Lunch Buffet has a wide variety of dishes but not much to pick for dessert.  Keema mater and chicken masala are by far the best that i tried. The Naan was a bit dry for my taste and they didnt have olive oil.   I also wish they had the mango icecream for dessert  that would make this place perfect.  Overall i would come back for the Lunch Buffet."}
{"text":"The wife, a friend, and I got take out at Indian garden tonight. We ordered Lamb Rogan Josh, Vindaloo, and Saag.   We got home and tried to unpack the curries. We need about 5 or 6 paper towels to even get to the curry. Everything was covered in oil. We finally got the curries and all of them were about 50% oil.   I ordered my curry a 9 on the spice level but what I got was some lamb chunks in oil with no heat at all.  The naan was ok and the mango lassi wasn't bad but the rest was a monstrosity.  Thanks Indian Garden for the bubble gut. I feel bad for my bathroom later."}
{"text":"Lakewood's (dare I say Cleveland's) best Indian cuisine. Authentic flavors, spice level that will meet any heat seeker's desires, and incredible selection. Lots of options that are vegan and GFree. Inside tip for those veg heads out there: Tuesdays and Wednesdays India Garden has a 2 meals for 20$ special, including soups! Definitely always serve more food than you can eat in one sitting so anticipate tasty leftovers!! Chana Masala... Er meh gerddd."}
{"text":"In sum, the is by and far the most exceptional Indian food in all of Western PA. I really enjoy their buffet too. Normally, I take the Anthony Bordain approach to Buffet which is avoid it at all cost as if plagued. BUT NOT HERE! The buffet here is prepared fresh, each and every time.  Indian buffets are popular in pittsburgh. However, a tasty addition found on their indian buffets is almost always an interesting goat dish. Their naan is amazing- crispy, rich, and delicate. I eat too much every time! I believe they are especially skilled in Tandori, Kofta, and Masala.   Please do not let the outdated exterior and location sway you- their food is amazing and their service is excellent each and every time. I've been coming here for years and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Wow! Seems like everyone else and their mother got the naan bread except for me and my mother!!! The buffet was tired. The selection was sparse. The food itself was barely mediocre. To be truthful I am a bit sceptical as to the freshness of the product. I am a trained certified Chef and did not touch 3 of the items displayed. Which left me with a selection of 3 items to consume which in turn lacked flavor and was greasy. The service was tolerable but unfortunately I know when a guest is unwanted and they just want to close the place up and watch TV. Perfect recipe for bankruptcy! Just a matter of time before this location is replaced by a learning center or bank."}
{"text":"Nice spot. Small and intimate. Very good food if you like it spicy this is the place for you. I like it hot and on a heat scale from 1-10 I chose a 7,and that was smoking. So beware of the heat. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Great food. Quick and courteous service. Never been disappointed, tried their catering as well for an event with 100 attendees and was awesome."}
{"text":"i was so disappointed in this restaurant.  it used to be one of the best Indian in ther burg and now it is a shell of a place. the food was mediocre..but who would know since the staff doesn't speak or understand enough English to take an order from the menu..they only want you to get the buffet because the can not understand what the customers want. 'i wanted an drink and no one on staff knew how to make any of the drinks on their drink menu so i thought  a rum and coke would be easy..no..i literally went behind the bar and sign languaged the server directions on how to mix rum and coke. i brought 10 people and it cost $152!!! we could onl have the buffet and drink rum and cokes...... what happened to the indian garden of 10 yrs ago?  too bad!!"}
{"text":"Use this place for restrooms and nothing more than that! Surprisngly restrooms are well maintained compared to food!  Never ever! Ever never visit this place!"}
{"text":"Not sure why such high reviews, it's ok Indian food but not good Indian food. All of the dishes seem very chunky and stew-like, different from the sauce or cream mixture type dishes I've seen before with indian food. Also everything had a ton of cilantro on it, and I'm not sure if that's traditional with indian cooking. The tikka masala is good, that's the only think I liked that I tried, but they use green bell pepper for some reason and I don't think that's what a traditional tikka masala uses. The chicken vindaloo was gross and had some gritty substance in it, possibly a piece of bone, I dunno. And the meat seems to be of a low quality. Aside from the tikka masala, which is just chunks of chicken breast which you can't really go wrong on that. I also tried the tandoori chicken, which has a good flavor, but with all the fat and bone on the meat, actually equated to very few ounces of protien. Naan is good, but I've noticed it tends to be burnt slightly most of the time, which maybe they do on purpose but I don't really think improves the flavor of it. This place is ok for the tikka masala but if you're looking for really good Indian food there are better places. I think this place just happens to do alright as it is one of the only places in the west Valley with indian food and so we settle for it because it's close"}
{"text":"I've been craving Indian food, and was finally able to get out to this restaurant. It totally surpassed my expectations. The lunch buffet was excellent!! It had more variety than I've experienced at other Indian lunch buffets. Everything was hot, fresh, and so delicious. The hot tea was a nice bonus. The restaurant is very clean and classy. The staff was very attentive with water and bread. Our plates were whisked away when we were ready for round two. After the meal, I went to the restroom to wash my hands and did not expect the level of cleanliness even in there.   I'll be recommending India Garden to my friends and co-workers. What a great value!!"}
{"text":"we have been to this place twice, after my colleague recommendation. The buffet was fresh, nice options, and service was good.  We had lunch buffet, i guess for around $10...  lot of options,, we will probably go there again//"}
{"text":"The owners are wonderful & extremely friendly. We love the buffet! My kids love to try all the different foods & like to view the huge mural in the back of the restaurant.  We love coming here!"}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review. The worst Indian food that I ever had was here! We ordered from the menu and also used the buffet. Buffet was all stale food. I felt like throwing up!! Never going there again."}
{"text":"The stake here is what to die for, and don't forget to try the bison burger!! HELLA DELICIOUS"}
{"text":"i came for a trip to Cleveland and my fate went so bad that i found this restaurant. we are 5 in number and ordered 5 chicken biryani. quantity was very less and there were resins which added sweet taste which was very bad. i ordered spicy food and they brought sweet biryani. while taking cost into consideration, they added 15$ as a gradduty and the total bill was 70$ +15$ more. i am very much disappointed."}
{"text":"I've stopped in here for lunch a few times on my way from Michigan to Maryland when traveling for work. The food at the lunch buffet is terrific. There are plenty of curries to choose from, and unlike many Indian lunch buffets, they often have \"premium\" curries such as Palak Paneer or Malai Kofta. In addition, there are plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits with the buffet, which really helps round out the meal and keep it from being so heavy. I've also been here a couple of times when they've had Southern Indian selections such as Masala Dosa, which is another nice perk.  The only thing I don't understand is the condition of the restrooms. They are beyond decayed and the floors are scary. I hope the owners of the restaurant read this and consider a thorough cleaning of the restrooms. It would really help raise customers' perceptions of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Took my wife to lunch here today and it was EXCEPTIONALLY good! The lunch buffet was incredible, as was their flat bread. Everything was perfectly cooked and the service was very friendly. We will definitely be going back, and often."}
{"text":"Very good but let's start from the beginning.  The bread and dips were good.I recommend only dipping the \"chippy\" bread in the green guacamole looking dip. The brownish dip had almost every single flavor and was not very good.  The Curry Chicken was very good and no doubt about it I would get it again. Also the Korma Lamb was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! It had a very good sauce around it. The Tandoori Shrimp came with perfectly cooked onions and the shrimp was perfect too. Also the garlic strips are plain.      Some of the downsides are just slow service and really bad drinks. Don't get any sodas! I'm telling you this is great food!"}
{"text":"I used to go to India Garden regularly for their lunch buffet, which featured a large selection of decent to good quality food for about $10. Early this summer they were shut down by the health department for a while, but this did not deter me from returning once they reopened. To my dismay, however, I found that the quantity and quality of the buffet items had fallen dramatically; several of my favorites were gone and the ones that remained did not taste as good as they used to. What's more, all the food was cold, which was one of the things they were cited for by the health department! I went back a second time, hoping that my previous visit was just an off day, but encountered the same problems. So much for this place; it was nice while it lasted."}
{"text":"Great place. Good service. Excellent food. Their chicken korma had traditional cashews and golden currents in it which most Indian places don't bother to include. Garlic naan was super tasty and large. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Sonny the owner of the restaurant, helped to organize an indian wedding party for us. He did a great job and the food was outstanding. I would personally recommend anyone to come eat here or ask Sonny to organize a party for you."}
{"text":"Great service! They will customize anything... We asked for butter to be left out of a couple of things, and they were happy to do it. Try the chippy bread, roti, and Bengan Bharta with a side order of rice. Both my husband and I were very happy with our orders."}
{"text":"Cheap lunch buffet. But I don't like India food. Everything seems disgusting. And smelly."}
{"text":"It is nice to see a restaurant  in this neighborhood that isn't a chain. Food is good, buffet is better than average and the menu items are really good. Staff is very attentive and great with my 18 month old little boy. If you prefer food spicy be sure to request  spicy  otherwise food is served just slightly spicy. Good quality food,great service and great place to take vegetarians. Chcken and spinach and Saag Paneer are excellent."}
{"text":"I've always been to the Monroeville location and the food is great! I am not much of a reviewer but I thought people should benefit from my review and eat here at least once to know how good it is. The naan is out of this world and chicken tikka masala is great. The service is great too - just the seating and interiors, I'm not really fond of but that's fine I guess. With so little good Indian food options in Pittsburgh, this is a must go place!"}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely amazing, however it took almost 35 minutes to be seated with two tables open. There was a 4 and a 6 top open, but we were three. We after 35 minutes decided to just sit at the table. Apparently that ticked off the only waiter they had so we got blown off for sitting without being seated. We received our food about an hour after we arrived. We ordered vegetable Korma, which is a coconut based vegetable dish, Lamb, and the chicken mango curry. I ordered each dish at 4-5 on the spicy scale and it was just a little too hot for me. They were attentive to us after we ordered but that first 45 minutes was rough. If I wasn't craving indian food I would have walked out several times. They need more service staff there! They must have filled at least 25-30 to go orders while I was there with only one ws iter and two \"helpers\"  5 stars on food; 1 star on service."}
{"text":"I love indian food. I saw good reviews about this place and decided to try it out. Good service, but staff was overly pushy. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the chicken tikka masalla, and there was something odd about the meat. It was very unappetizing, and made me want to vomit.   I was super excited to try it out, but was deeply disappointed. Im shocked to see people saying this is the best Indian they have ever had. ummm. no."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for several years now! They have delicious and very authentic Indian food.  The customer service is awesome and they make you feel so welcome! We love eating here and the food is always excellent! If you are in the area I strongly recommend you try India Garden I know you won't be disappointed!! They allow you to custom your level of spice which is nice for those who want it less spicy or more spicy!  Whether you want to get take out or dine in India Garden is the perfect place for Indian food on the west side.  They have a wonderful buffet too at lunch with lots of options."}
{"text":"Although I almost always carry out, India Garden also has a fantastic lunch buffet for a good price.  Daal Makhani (sp?) is my go to dish of creamed lentils paired with white rice and tandoori naan.  My fiance gets the fish vindaloo (maybe not on the menu) and vegetables.  Veggie pakora is a great appetizer. Consistently awesome except their 1-10 scale of spiciness is not always accurate.  Watch out for a spicy curveball if you don't like it hot!"}
{"text":"Okay, people need to lay off this place! Coming from an Indian family, I know good Indian food. The food is great and the servers are often nice. Yes, I agree that sometimes they can be a little off but they are never rude or pushy. My old floormate and I loved going to India Garden whenever we got the chance. She always got the Chicken Tikka Masala (which is really really good) and I love their lamb/goat curry with Basmati Rice. The flavors are fantastic! You can really taste authentic Indian food here. If you're not a fan of spicy food then you can surely make a request to not have the peppers added to your dish. They're always happy to comply. My friend lovesss the Gulab Jamuns. Ive tried the mango ice cream but it didn't really do anything for me.   If you do go to India Garden, make sure you go at least once during the dinner or lunch buffets. One word: DELICIOUS. Everything is so fresh and great and you leave completely stuffed! All for just $8.99! Perfect for a college student's budget. If you can't get there during the buffet times, don't worry, the rest of the menu is really fairly priced.   India Garden is definitely the first place I'm going once I get back to Pittsburgh in a few days!"}
{"text":"The best service in town!! We enjoyed a wonderful spring evening of delicious food and ambiance--with a tall glass of Taj Mahal lager! We'll certainly be back again and again. Thank you to the kind team at India Garden!"}
{"text":"One of the absolute best places in all of Lakewood. The manager was extremely conscientious of our needs as customers and made sure that the food we were given were prepared with absolutely no nuts, as one of us had a nut allergy. Tasty food, great service, fun atmosphere, you can't go wrong. There's something for everyone here, and I hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential, great area, very clean atmosphere, and a very fun place visually. But the food just doesn't cut it for me, it's not that I don't like it, don't get me wrong I was satisfied. At the end of the day, I feel they could learn a little something from other great Indian restaurants, like chutney's, and the curry corner."}
{"text":"Clean place, friendly staff, food delicious and they were extremely flexible when we asked for vegan options."}
{"text":"If you aren't looking out you might miss this place because it's set back a bit from the road.  Turn around and go back, though!  You don't want to miss out on the food.  Get the samosas!  If you take a friend who hasn't had Indian food or who isn't very adventurous I'd say that the samosa is something great to ease them into the yumminess that is Indian food.  I'm a fan of mango chutney on my samosas and there was none included with our order when we had it for take out or dine in BUT I didn't ask.  Next time I will because they are all super friendly and go out of the way to make you happy with things.    I won't pretend- I get chicken curry anytime I go for Indian food.  I usually stick with an order of samosas at vegetarian Indian places.  The chicken curry at Indian Garden is flavorful and they'll do it at your preferred spice level.  If you're not used to Indian food be sure to start off low.  My mother loves spicy foods usually.  Her first Indian food came out too spicy- it's a different kind of spicy I suppose.  I like it at a 4- just spicy enough but not too spicy.  Here's why the place gets 4 stars (I'd have given it a 3.5 if I could) and that is because the curry chicken is not cut to pieces.  Ok- that sounds like I'm 5 and need my food cut up or something.  It is chicken breast  according to the menu and I think it is.  You know how chicken has that part you don't want to eat (gristle?  whatever it is you KNOW what I mean) well you can't tell where that is because of the sauce.  I'm weirdish about that.  Other people may not care and be totally fine.  That's what gets me.    The waiter was just amazing and the other guy coming around making sure water glasses were kept full and plates cleared was ON IT without being annoying.  When I called for take out and picked up the order the person assisting me was just fabulously friendly.   This makes me think that someone with questions about the dishes should ask without hesitation- and that's a good thing when people are expanding their food horizons!  Who knows- maybe I'll break away from the curry chicken sometime..."}
{"text":"This place has the best Indian food! I will drive 45-59 minutes for it. Small place but after talking to owed he has kept it that way to make the food remain authentic w kitchen size. I respect that. Worth what wait you may have on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Love India Garden! The food and service are great. They are very attentive, warm and hospitable. It has a very mom and pop vibe and almost makes you feel as though you're eating at an Indian family's house. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I was passing through town and came towards the end of their buffet time. The tandoori chicken and korma were perfect, though a little spicier than what I'm used to. The other buffet items were good and probably variations on cuisines I've had in the Chicago area.   I would definitely return and bring a friend the next time I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. So full of flavor! And the service was so friendly. This is definitely going to be a regular place for me."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Lovely space and nice staff but I didn't enjoy the food at the lunch buffet. It was mostly bland and all tended to taste similar. I didn't think it had enough of the distinctive spices that I've enjoyed at other indian restaurants in other parts of the country."}
{"text":"The service here was great very outgoing and helpful with the menu. The food was cooked exactly to order and fantastic!! My family and I will definitely come back to enjoy great food in a welcoming environment!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! We had the vegetable samosa, chicken curry and potato and pea curry.  It was all flavorful and delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible Food ! The lunch buffet had spoiled food ,even after informing the restaurant owner , they did not remove the spoiled food from the buffet !   Literally a lady was fighting for the poor quality in food , Manager seems so rude... Please do not go to this place !!!"}
{"text":"The food, service, and people were amazing. I saw a few reviews stating their food was cold. The food was piping hot and delicious. Our waitress was helpful in determining the right amount of spice. Can't wait to come back! Oh, and don't forget dessert...yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is plain awesome. Quite possibly some of the best Indian food I've ever had. It's set in a neighborhood by the university and heard during school it's super packed with a huge wait. But, school wasn't in session and we were seated right away. Portions are small, but you don't need much when you have a piping hot plate of curry awesomeness. The garlic naan ist heavenly and (even though out of a gallon jug) mango drink goes perfectly.    Highly recommended spot if you are in Pitt and craving all of the above. Also, as in any Indian Restaurant it seems - pop music blasting in the background and velvet paintings. Lots to look at and big, comfy wood booths.    Lovely."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants i have been to. Walk in and there is a very pungent smell in the first room. I didnt write this review when i smelt that... But read on... I called and placed specific items in my order. The bhendi masala (one of the simplest dishes) was messed up.... The chef must really put in effort to screw up bhindi masala. Next... I ordered for tomato dal (check their menu..they have this dish) and whats in my box? Channa masala!! I drove 40 miles one way for this... Totally disappointed. I called them to explain this n the lady asks if i want to come back again n take a new order!!!! No way baby... Thank you"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Indian food I have ever had, anywhere.  The staff is super friendly and accommodating to every request I've made.  The lamb korma is quite possibly the best thing I have ever eaten in my life... I do not say that without some hesitation, as I do eat out a lot and have had amazing dishes everywhere, but this dish is a truly sensual eating experience.  The garlic naan is also great, very fresh garlic.  It's rare to eat at a restraint and end the meal thinking that every single item that was brought to the table was outstanding, yet it happens almost every time we dine at India Garden."}
{"text":"Having moved to Tampa, I really miss India Garden and their amazing food.  The baingan bharta is the best that I have had and their chicken curry is always good, no matter which one that you get.  The owners are great too."}
{"text":"we ate here 11/17/12.  we've always come in for lunch buffet since they serve our favorite goat curry.  pretty good deal for $9.95.  what we had  naan  their naan bread is classic.  served hot on your table.  chewy and soft, just the right texture.  not overcooked, this is very good naan.  (9 / 10)  baingan bharta  eggplant is cooked perfectly with the right blend of  tomatoes and onions.   a little too salty though.  (6 / 10)  bund gobi aur mattar  i think of this is their indian version of coleslaw.  not bad.  a good complement to the spices of other savory dishes.  (7/10)  dhaba goat curry  i actually dreamed about this in anticipation the night before we had lunch buffet.  we always try to pick out the bone-in meat - trust me, it's always tastier and more tender.  watch out for the sauce as it can be too spicy (if you're not used to it).  but definitely flavorful.  very tender, succulent, tasty dish.  this is what we come here for, and we call before we come to check if they're serving this dish for lunch.  a must have.  (9.5 /10)  aloo matar  one of the more typical side dishes  (4 / 10)   chicken tikka masala  the next best main dish after goat curry.  quite a favorite of other non-Indian patrons.  creamy sauce with the perfect mix of herbs and spices.  Kids may want to try this one out.  (7.5 / 10)  bhinda masala    my favorite side dish.  can't tell the difference from baingan bharta except for the okra instead of eggplant.  but truly, okra is the star.  great texture on the vegetables and perfectly complements the spices of other dishes.  (9.5 / 10)  basmati rice  love the smell and texture of the cooked rice.  a perfect pairing for their saucy dishes.  Chicken tandoori  another common dish.  tasty bone-in chicken in red/orange color probably due to the marinade and spices that go with it.  meat can be sometimes dry or tough.  this is below average.  (4.5 /10 chopsticks)  vegetable pakora  flavorful and fried crispy.  the breading is thicker (compared to vegetable tempura).  (6 / 10 chopsticks)  kheer  sweet rice in coconut milk.  pair it with their unsweetened chai tea latte.  a great way to end the meal.  not too sweet, texture of rice is just right, mild refreshing flavors.  (8 / 10 chopsticks)  take  may be a typical indian lunch buffet if you compare common indian dishes like chicken tandoori or chicken tikka masala.  but we come here for the goat curry, which most of the time is not served in other places.  the bhinda masala is also very, very good.  unique, tasty, and complementary.  our favorite indian place in the cleveland area.  also love the small, cozy, nothing fancy atmosphere.

{"text":"Booked banquet hall and had bad experience with food,sound system and attitude of the management.... will never plan an event here unless for space :("}
{"text":"This has become our favorite restaurant on the West Side of Phoenix.  We love Indian food and go to Indian restaurants a lot.  We just spent several years in LA, and ate at quite few of them.  India Garden's food is as good as the best ones we tried in LA. We love the buffet, both for its panoply of intense and interesting flavors and because my boyfriend can eat all he wants. The family members who own and run the restaurant are both very friendly and very professional.  Service is attentive and accurate.  They already know my name and that I'm a vegan, and often offer to make an extra vegan dish for me even though what I have chosen is the buffet.  The naan is lovely and they supply it generously.  I like the big airy room, and the beautiful curtains the owner made herself.  I, too, love that they play recordings of Indian music."}
{"text":"Delicious! My whole family plowed through the mixed grill, chicken tikka masala, ginger chicken, chicken jalfrezi and saag paneer in record time. Friendly and helpful staff even brought us chai and mango lassis for the kids. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"WARNING: THIS PLACE NO LONGER SERVES INDOCHINESE......  First of all let me state, this is my first real negative review, which makes me pretty bummed out.   Anyways, disappointment number 1 was from the lack of the Indochinese. So we carried on since we were a party of seven. Mistake number 2. It took literally a round trip from India and back to even get a drink order taken. Now this is like a typical thing I have seen from Indian restaurants, maybe just my luck. WHY IS IT THAT THE SERVERS SEEM TO THINK OF OTHER INDIANS AS PEASANTS AND NOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE PAYING CUSTOMERS, AT THAT 20% GRATUITY!! After the drinks were placed we ordered some apps. Chicken Tikka from the tandoori oven and some paneer tikka from the tandoori oven. Both were mediocre at best. Nothing special, actually pretty bland. We then went ahead and ordered a chicken rangon josh, a panner tikka masala, and a baigan bharta dishes. Hmmm....well lets just say the chicken didn't seem like it was real chicken. The panner was pretty shabby too. The bharta was alright. Problem was when they asked us for a spice level, we thought, since the apps were bland, that the food should be ordered with a little kick. So we ordered a 7 out of 10 heat level. Well lets just say they made it like a 10+....which meant it was pretty inedible. The only thing decent was the naan and rice.   Finally what really irked me was the lack of a detailed bill. We got a credit card slip with a total amount, no breakdown. Thats pretty shady.   I have been to many Indian restaurants, and this one hit the bottom of my list. Maybe your taste buds will say something different, but if I were you, I would give this a shrug."}
{"text":"We happened to dine here tonight and the over all experience is really overwhelming.A big \"No No \" for spice lovers as the food  is  sweet and we could not even complete half of it . The ambiance and the entrance are way off to the food with the waiters being attentive and responsive.The restaurant is a small boxy place with neatly arranged  tables . We ordered manchurian for a starter , which was served quickly with a divine look , but the taste is devastating which stabbed out our appetite . We also ordered egg biryani  & a thali in which  biryani looked delectable but didn't taste anything like biryani or fried rice atleast  Thali is even worse as the curries are sweet even though the spice level we ordered is more , the parata they served   with the thali is very hard ,soggy n un chewable. The only thing you can probably like is the experience which is  freaking  expensive (40$ + tips)  Overall : May be they concentrated more only on plate decoration rather than taste of food  Don't fall for the pictures as your eyes deceive you"}
{"text":"Food is very good and the staff is awesome! We will be coming back most frequently. Eggplant dish amazing, chicken and goat were marvelous. Buffet is a real deal at 9.99."}
{"text":"I tried India Garden for the first time last night for take-out.  The garden salad was amazing - abundant amounts of cucumber, tomatoes, red onion, spices and lemon.  Very light and refreshing for summer.  I asked for the dressing on the side and honestly, the salad did not even need dressing with the lemon juice / spices.  The garlic naan was delicious.  As my entree, I asked for the Shrimp Saag.  I asked for additional vegetables and a medium spice.  The saag sauce was delicious and the spice was just right.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love India Garden and their staff! The food is delicious, fresh and the serving sizes are generous! They start with a basket of papadum and various dipping sauces and it's amazing! They're always happy to bring us more. On our most recent visit we were brought a dish of veggie pakora that we didn't order. The server kindly explained they felt our dishes were taking too long so they brought us that in the meantime. It was so nice and to be honest we hadn't been waiting long at all! I would have been fine without it, but the gesture was greatly appreciated and delicious!  Our favorite dish is definitely the (mild) chicken tikka masala (also a great dish for a first timer)! We always get two orders of naan bread. We have tried the plain naan, garlic and the chicken naan, all of which were equally delicious and well made.  The atmosphere is very relaxing, a little dim (but not dark, it's comfortable), quiet and overall friendly! The staff are always smiling, friendly and attentive. I've never had to look around for a water refill or ask how much longer. They are quick, efficient and so yummy! We love it here and recommend it to everybody!"}
{"text":"India Garden is a great go-to for lunch buffet or late-night food.  The selection is wide, the food is delicious, and the price is nice (but much better during the half off periods.)  The service is pretty mediocre at best, but to be honest I didn't expect much.  They're slow, generally unfriendly, and my water goes unfilled a lot. It wasn't always that way, but oh well.  The atmosphere is pretty enjoyable, in my opinion.  I like having late night food and drinks while Bollywood music videos blare in the background.  It makes for a loud restaurant, but when you're partying late at night, you're not looking for a quiet place.  Overall, this is a good place for Indian food.  The selection is great, with tons of things on the menu (almost 100 or more I think).  It's definitely not the best Indian food in the Burgh, but the portions and prices let you share a bunch of dishes around, resulting in what I'd consider a true Indian dining experience.  I'd recommend late night after 10, when the food goes half-price."}
{"text":"I hope this restaurant is still open. I haven't visited in over a month, but the last time I was there, I settled in for the lunch buffet and was pleased by the smallish yet satisfying spread. Garlic naan is generously served, and  the owners are quite friendly. On each of my visits (I believe I've dined here three times), the dining room has been somewhat sparse. I do hope more people discover this reliably good Indian food restaurant--it's much-needed on the chain-heavy Westside."}
{"text":"I just finished dining here with family. It was my first authentic indian experience in ohio. I really enjoyed it.  The staff was beyond helpful and attentive. Empty glasses were consistently refilled and they offered very helpful suggestions when we were undecided on what to order. I was very impressed with the staff and the food; which I found to be incredible. I will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner here with my mother and my brother.  All family members have eaten Indian food in various places including NYC, San Fran, and India!  India Garden is the real deal! The restaurant has a calm, lovely setting and the food is YUMMY!  Also, the owner was our server and he was super kind to us; taking time to answer our questions, he gave us samples and even wrapped up some extra rice for us to take home.  The menu has a fine selection of dishes that you can adjust upon request.  For example, I love Tikka Masala, but am a vegetarian, so they made me Paneer (cheese) Tikka Masala.  It was fantastic! You can also pick your level of spicy hotness for your dish.  Overall, India Garden is a wonderful place and I will return to it as often as possible!  Keep it alive in Cleveland and go fill your tummy! You won't regret it.  Namaste!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Been waiting awhile for a good indian lunch. Finally got away from the family (wife who doesn't like spicy foods). Food was mediocre. Very mild and I noticed they use the cheapest cuts of meats. Naan had too much flour on it and was very thin like a cracker almost. Water they gave me tasted like city tap. Food needs more flavor and more kick. Sorry India Garden. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went to the lunch buffet here. The food was fresh and delicious even though I was there towards the tail end of the buffet. I generally like my Indian food a little spicier, and the buffet didn't have any spicier options. That being said, the selection was great (loved the onion pakoras) and the staff was honestly the friendliest I've encountered in a while. The naan was fresh and warm. I'll be back again, although maybe for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Went online to place an order for take out appetizer off their online menu. 2 Veg. Samosa, I Chicken Pokora, 1 Tandoori Wings and 1 Chicken Naan. Went to pick up the order and got a bill for  $ 28.50, should have been around $ 19.00 I wanted to know where this amount came from, and I was told ---- we don't have Chicken Wings on the menu. I was told, the menu was from the previous owner ---\" from long time ago\".   Well, this has nothing to do with what I see, instead of the wings, they gave me some Chicken Legs, looked like Tandoori ( could have been Madras) but were buried under a pile of onions and tasted terrible. Now, if you don't have an item, I understand, just tell me so, but don't take an order and substitute with something else, and when I question something like this, don't put up an argument. If they have not taken the time to update the web site, it should not be used. Unfortunately, there are no Indian Restaurants in Goodyear or Avondale, but Indian Garden is not a place I would recommend. The appetizers tasted so-so, and I don't want to think what the food would taste like. There are two good Indian/Pakistani places Udupi and Curry Corner, both in Tempe. Excellent food at very reasonable prices, but unfortunately, a long way from home."}
{"text":"Great fresh Indian food with great service...found this place on YELP as we were leaving Scottsdale to go to LA."}
{"text":"Always a gastronomic experience for me and my family. My daughters love the food and the entire place in general. The staff is always accommodating and very kind to our children. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite restaurant of all time!!! Absolutely delicious! The best Indian food in Cleveland hands down! I could eat it every day (I've gone weeks where I have lol). Go for the lunch buffet, it's amazing, great deal! Great vegetarian options, awesome chutneys, out of this world naan, and yummy rice pudding! Be sure to try the vegetable/aloo Korma (in a tomato cream sauce), paneer saag (cheese in spinach sauce), and the baingan bartha (smoky pureed eggplant)!  You can't go wrong with a mix of onion chutney, tamarind chutney, and raita (yogurt sauce). The service is always fantastic, beverages always filled and plenty of naan (2-3 pieces at a time magically appear on your plate  lol)."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant. I went here for the first time and it was incredible. The outstanding service alone is enough to keep me going back. The food was delicious as well. It's all homemade and they're very accommodating. As a vegan, I'm particular about where I eat and it's important that the staff understands my needs. They went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and to give me exactly what I asked for. Our server even made me his favorite [vegan] dish to try beside my order. The staff is nothing but wonderful and the food is to die for. If you're on the fence about trying this place because it's different or how small/passable it is, debate no more. This is one of the finest establishments I've ever been to and I will be a lifelong returning customer."}
{"text":"Not authentic Indian food but something which may appeal to american customers. Ambience is very good which is luxury in indian restaurants. I didn't like biryani here. Gobi dish is ok ok."}
{"text":"THERE WAS A ROACH IN MY FOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My curiosity for Indian food and decent reviews convinced me to give this place a try today.  Huge mistake!!!  I was a little skeptical after reading one review that described someone elses \"roach\" experience.  Since the rest of the reviews were decent, I decided to disregard it, thinking maybe it was someone who simply had a bad experience and was wanting to give the restaurant a bad name.    I placed a take out order over the phone.  The service was prompt and friendly.  I picked up my food, returned to work excited for my lunch, until I found a big roach sitting on top of my rice.  Luckily, I hadn't taken any bites!    I wasted my entire lunch hour, only to find myself hungry, with no time to get anything else.  The manager explained that the restaurant had just been sprayed for roaches, which he claims makes them spread everywhere.  Good to know right?  In the end, I was given a full refund but it didn't make up for my time and disgusting experience.  The manager seemed to really make light of the situation.  Apparently he's okay with his \"tenants\".  Unless you're okay with having an extra crunch in your food, you really shouldn't eat here."}
{"text":"Placed a delivery order, over 1.5 hours later was told they never received the order.  Shame."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant. I must admit I am not an expert on Indian cuisine , but the 4-5 times that I've been to this restaurant it is always been good and fresh with good service. It is ran by a family from Nepal. The Tikka Masala is really good. I highly recommend Indian Garden and at $9.99 for the lunch buffet is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Best india buffet I have ever seen! Great service, very nice place"}
{"text":"********** THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE BUFFET ONLY **********  We've been going to this restaurant's buffet on and off for quite a while.  We went again today after a long hiatus, because the last time we went, the food was so salty, I had to rinse my mouth with gasoline afterwards to get rid of the taste (naaah:  I'm not overly dramatic at all).  So, first off, let's start by saying, that whatever salt was in the food today, it was very muted.  The tandoori chicken was good, as it's always been, if not a little dry.  But it is a buffet and food can sit for a while; chicken drying out on a buffet table is not unusual.  I won't talk much about the other food, because, to be honest, I don't remember their names.  But I can say, there is quite a variety for those with different tastes and a nice selection for what you'll pay.  The star of this restaurant --- never mind 'the buffet' or 'regular meals' or whatever ... I don't care --- is the naan bread.  This is the one thing, which is done perfectly here:  not too thick; not oily, which you find very often with this bread; nice and crispy, but not overcooked.  Both of us agree:  we could seriously make a meal of naan and a dipping sauce.  Service is, and always has been, pleasant.  The one surprising change for me:  at the back of the restaurant is a rather large mural with a nice, serene painting.  Apparently, they use that area for groups and, according to the server, had a large one yesterday.  I don't know, whether they've always had this, but there are curtains to block off the room from the view of the restaurant.  That's fine and perfectly reasonable when you have groups.  But the curtains are rather cheezy and I swore, they converted the place into a large shower room when I first saw it.  When I asked the server about it, he quite graciously offered to open them, which, I said, was unnecessary.  And it was.  But it really gave the restaurant the impression of having come up with some cheap, quick solution to a situation and, as I said, made me feel like I could go rinse off in a hot tub behind the curtains after buffet was over.    The curtains and simplistically decorated restaurant are but minor distractions in an otherwise good buffet located in an area not known for good food.  When you consider that Indian restaurants and buffets aren't exactly flooding the West Valley, then this place is something to really appreciate.  I could go on about what I would like to see on the buffet table and what would make it better; but, to be frank, you can do MUCH worse for what the lunch buffet costs.  My only wish:  please extend lunch buffet past 2:30pm. I know that's typical, but some of us eat later in the day.  Just a wish; not a complaint."}
{"text":"The food is good.  The service was excellent.  Usually however, in Indian restaurants, they give the rice WITH the food.  At this particular restaurant you have order the rice separately and its pretty expensive.  I thought this restaurant was a little more pricier than most.  I don't think I would rush back here for dinner when I am in AZ again but may try the buffet for more of the options."}
{"text":"First time trying Indian food for my partner and I and it was absolutely delicious. The customer service was excellent as well. We highly recommend this restaurant. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet tons of options for veg and non veg friendly. Everything was delicious would def recommend the lunch buffet for $10 dollars."}
{"text":"We went to the lunch buffet, there was a great selection of food. The price was the best I've found and the food was really good. I feel overall the quality of food, price and atmosphere are a great combination. There is also outside seating."}
{"text":"This place went downhill fast, seek out any other india garden location for better luck! In general at Pitt, all the students would go here for half off food since it was cheap ok indian food.  Slowly they cut their hours back and closed earlier and earlier. They got rid of their tv's with the music videos and have made sure to higher even ruder, slower waiters. (aka as it was said before they have no clue what a water pitcher is...) Everything u read about the bad reviews is so true (rushing customers, not putting in right orders, skimping on the rice and then charging u extra for a lil more, and blank angry stares)  On my most recent experience, I did not even get to eat. I made sure to find out their hours and rushed over after work getting there a half hour before they closed at 10. I barely walked thru the door when they exclaimed they were closed. I then asked if I could get carryout and they said no. What is the point of having hours of business (that keep getting smaller) when you are not going to keep them?  *on a side note my friend was actually already eating in there, and she said that after I left some people came in and ordered take out*   Didn't think it was true, but guess only their fellow Indian friend's get the good service..."}
{"text":"We went there near the end of the lunch buffet.  The food was hot and fresh.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Indian Food in Lakewood.  Hooray!    GOOD STUFF:  As above...A fairly good Indian Restaurant in Lakewood.  Food is better than most that I've had in Cleveland and very reasonably priced.  Service is friendly.  BAD STUFF:  The venue, I have to say is only so so.  Kind of non-descript place without much atmosphere.    PRICE:  Fairly inexpensive.....about 30$ for two with a glass of wine or beer.  OVERALL:  A solid Indian food restaurant in Lakewood.  The venue is only so so but the food is solid and the service when I went was good.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Excellent food, super service and genuinely friendly people.  My daughter had the Chicken Tikka Marsala and it was excellent ... she opted for a heat level of five and asked for sauce to kick it up to a six or seven.  Restaurant staff were only too happy to oblige and even offered to redo the dish for her.  I had the Lamb Vinadaloo which has both Indian and Portugese origins.  The lamb was excellent and very tender.  Also had an Indian beer, Flying Horse, which was quite good and a good pairing for the lamb.  The place appears unassuming from the outside but is more than comfortable inside.  I was particularly impressed by the staff's willingness to explain what the dishes were andcwhat theybtasted like.  I will go back."}
{"text":"I had the non veg platter and it was just okay. I didn't find anything really great about the food. One minor annoyance, and I'm not sure I can really fault the restaurant for this, was I asked to replace one item with another but my server declined saying it was a set menu. I didn't see the big deal, but I suppose they have to stick to their rules. Anyway I just didn't think much of my food. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't spectacular either. The kheer was really good but I found the food to be just okay."}
{"text":"Pictures of the outside of the building made me a little leery about going to India Garden.  Once inside, you forget that you're in what probably is an old Lawson's.  It's decorated very nicely!    We were seated and given water right away.  Our order was taken promptly.  My special order wasn't a problem.  We liked that we got to choose our preferred heat on the 1-10 scale, since mine was an 8.5 and my husband's was a 1.    The food was brought out quickly, and was very, very good.  The waiter or owner, who was taking care of us, offered to remake mine if it was too hot.  That was quite nice, but the heat was just fine.    We are both looking forward to going again, and since it's not too far from home, I can see India Garden becoming a regular place for us."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian restaurant in Cleveland. Not only is the food delicious and authentic, but the service is excellent. You get great individual attention and you feel like you're at home when you dine in. This is our favorite Indian restaurant - it can't be beat!!"}
{"text":"We were directed to a table, but then we were left without any menus nor clue as to whether or not we were expected to be only eating from the buffet. My friend was distressed about it so I walked up to someone & asked if my friend could order from the menu (she didn't want the full expense of the $9 buffet as she wasn't so hungry, it was mostly me that was hungry). The buffet itself wasn't bad but I had hoped for a wider selection. Another couple that came in after us were seated & given menus, so maybe it was a fluke. Based on the initial service experience & buffet selection, I can't really rate highly, sorry. I've had much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"The owner is wonderful, along with his staff. Have been coming here for almost a year. We have tried other Indian restaurants, but I couldn't eat their food, until we ate here. We love the food here. We drove almost 1/2-hour to get here. The kitchen is like a magic work shop, because all my life I couldn't eat onion, but I could the onions from here, without getting sick. This is where I go for comfort food. The more I eat the food from here, the more I want the food from here."}
{"text":"The food here is good overall, but there are inconsistencies. We get takeout from here maybe once every month to every couple of months. I always order the same thing, and sometimes it's spicier, sometimes not, despite ordering it the same way every time. It's not bad enough that we'd stop ordering though. We've never experienced bad service here either."}
{"text":"I have had far better in DC and the NW, but the lunch buffet and service were good. A couple of the dishes seemed watery and the nan had room for improvement."}
{"text":"I was very happily surprised by this restaurant. I don't think I've ever had authentic Indian food before and I didn't think I'd like it. My mind was completely changed by this restaurant, the food was delicious and what made me even happier is the extensive list of vegetarian options! It looks tiny from the outside but the inside is super cozy and had a great atmosphere. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time the food was very good. The service was excellent. The staff was very helpful in describing their dishes, was prompt, and accommodating with a smile.   I will go back. Chicken tikka Marsala was great."}
{"text":"Love their curry.... Sooooo good!!!!!! I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I tried the buffet for lunch.  That's why I am removing a star.  There were 4 vegetarian choices and 4 meat choices.  I was a little surprised to see \"beef\" meatballs.  The Tandoori chicken was cold, and the Saag Paneer had no Paneer in it."}
{"text":"I was shopping at Sprouts next door to this place debating on if I wanted to go home and cook or tryout this place and this place won! I wasn't sure what to expect when walking through the doors on a Sat evening around 7pm but I was starving and didn't feel like cooking. I had only tried Indian food once in my life about 10 years ago but I figured why not? To my surprise it was great as far as food was concerned! The ambiance was not great at all and it was one large room and to some degree resembled a cafeteria. I wouldn't suggest taking your first date here but if you are up for some great food in a casual atmosphere its a great choice for Indian food. I loved the variety of flat breads they had to offer and the menu is very extensive and they do  a great job of breaking down your choices and categorizing it to your liking. Our waiter was great and had some really great suggestions. He recommended that we stop by during lunch time because they offer a lunch buffet that has a little bit of everything and has accumulated great reviews from the locals. Overall, the service was great and I really enjoyed the food options I chose and the extensive menu that makes me want to come back to try something new:)"}
{"text":"Made my way out to Lakewood to give I.G. a try after some good reviews on here, and a couple from co-workers.  I was waiting for a day to be able to try the lunch buffet, and was not dissappointed, but not impressed either.  As usual, I did a semi late lunch, geting there a little before 1:30, and made my way thru the buffet, and got the last of the rice that must have been sitting there a while, because when I got back, the rice was crunchy, and some got stuck in my teeth, which is just annoying.  As far as the curry chicken,dal, other vegetarian, as well as meaty mains were quite tasty.  The Tandoori chicken was a bit dry however.  As I went up for a second plate, there was no naan, or rice at the buffet, so I was a little dissappointed that they still hadn't brought any fresh rice.  I picked a couple things out, and went back to my table sans rice and naan.  Luckily about to minutes later, they brought fresh naan table to table, but unfortunatly never brough tout the rice, although two peoplehad walked in after me and got the buffet.  I assume they were just waiting on it to cook, but its surprising that such a highly rated palce would be out of rice for 15 minutes, and stale before that.   I didn't end up leaving hungry, but I didn't gorge myself as I would if there had been rice, or any desserts that I liked a little better, which worked out since I found a good pastry place down the road...."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place based on a couple of co-workers' recommendations and we were not disappointed! From the moment we walked in the door until we left, the staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful! Our waiter was kind enough to give us a complimentary small portion of the goat curry for us to try  (we were somewhat hesitant to try goat since we've never had it before) and we were very pleasantly surprised! We ordered the chicken tikka masala and lamb vindaloo and both were very tasty!! The garlic naan was delicious! Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last week towards the tail end of their lunch buffet.  Staff were very friendly and happily refilled several dishes on the buffet.  I especially enjoyed the eggplant and tea.  Great value for $10."}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying that while my group was there on a busy Friday night, there were 2 guys running the show (hosting, serving, bussing, filling drinks), and not once did we feel poorly taken care of. Despite being short staffed, they were absolutely smashing it, and with a friendly attitude at that.   The food was delicious. We ordered the chicken tikka (on accident - we meant to order Tikka Masala, to which our server happily brought out both once we informed him!!), samosas, saag paneer, and Bhindi Masala along with the garlic naan. I left a very full and happy woman, and the leftovers were gone by lunch the next day.   Very pleased with the service, the food, and the prices. Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for an Indian spot in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"What a let down...  - we have a coupon book and tried to use the coupon which was  buy one entree get one free. When I showed the coupon to the server, he stated that there is no way that they will honor those and didn't even acknowledge that  it was for his company.  If you see any coupons or advertisements for India Garden on Dysart - beware that they do not honor them."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for their half price food after 10:30 PM (only vegetarian items and some chicken items).  They never had good service; it was slow and water glasses rarely were refilled, but I thought it was worth it because it was cheap.  I came here once at dinner time, thinking that service might be better.  I was wrong - the restaurant was practically empty, but the food was still slow to come out and slightly cold.  The main difference was that it wasn't noisy with Bollywood music videos (one of things I liked), and that it cost twice as much.  After the last time I visited during half price, when we didn't get our orders until the lights in the restaurant started coming up (after several tables who came in after us had eaten and left), I've given up on India Garden.  The food is fine, nothing special, and the price is good, but the service is too terrible to deal with."}
{"text":"Chicken masala takeout is what I ordered. My very first time here and first time eating Indian food. It was really good. Definitely come here again and will try other options.  P.s. I wish that photo of the dead fly, on the side of the plate would get taken down. It is very unappealing and really, it could've noted on their comment instead of taking a disgusting picture and posting it on here."}
{"text":"Being nice and giving 3 stars. It's more like a 2 1/2 but no half star ratings so I'm rounding up. Service was friendly but extremely slow. And only one other diner when I walked in. I love Chicken Tikka Masala so naturally I ordered it. Worst I've ever had. Everything else was good (garlic naan & chutneys). They were conveniently out of the smaller size beers so they gave me a large one (and charged me for the large). I should have looked around for a better Indian restaurant but I didn't want to venture far from where I was. Whoever is giving 5 stars is smoking crack (or affiliated with the establishment since they're all giving themselves fake positive reviews these days). Also tablecloths were dirty as reported by other Yelpers."}
{"text":"DON'T EAT here. They are a bunch of CHEATS.  I ate there on a weekday night and the bill came to $13. I got a posted credit card transaction for $26. When I called them to check, they behaved like complete A**HOLES and would not respond to my questions. I have filed a dispute with my bank. If you eat here(which you shouldn't) remember to pay by cash."}
{"text":"Good food. My wife and I always enjoy coming here for dinner. I recommend India Garden."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian Restaurants. Food is great & service is pretty good. Also, their official website is at www.IndiaGardenPA.com"}
{"text":"When I'm honest with myself, I realize I am giving this restaurant 4 stars at least in part for the nostalgic value. As I come to the end of my undergraduate education at Pitt, I look back fondly on my dozens of late-night visits to India Garden. I have never been here other than during half-off. They have changed the hours for half-off a lot in the last few years, so here's the official update, as of September 2010: a selection of entrees that includes all vegetarian and most chicken dishes is half-off 5-6 pm and 9-11 pm.  Ordering from the half-off menu makes this place a bargain - I think I would consider it somewhat overpriced otherwise. The menu is vast and covers a wide range of different styles of Indian cooking, though focused on Northern Indian dishes like most Indian restaurants in the US. There are probably about 60 or more entrees, including about 20 or so vegetarian ones. You get a ton of food, as well - I almost never finish mine, and take it home for lunch the next day.  The only drawback to the food is the extremely inconsistent \"spiciness levels.\" The server typically asks for you to indicate your desired spiciness on a scale of 1-10. I usually order a 5 or 6 and have received everything from \"suitable for infants\" to \"ow ow my tongue.\" While the food is inconsistent, it is always good and I always enjoy it.  The inside of the restaurant is dark and is pretty loud at night, with the Bollywood music blaring. I have noticed that it has been quieter the last few times I've been there, though.  The service is sullen, sometimes slow, but otherwise perfectly adequate. Be polite and friendly to your server and you'll get politeness and friendliness back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, I'd highly recommend the goat curry if you're a fan of bone marrow and amazing flavor."}
{"text":"My roommate and I came to India Garden about once every two weeks (and sometimes once a week or more) for half-price dinner. Maybe things have changed, since I moved from Pittsburgh in 2008, but we had the BEST service I've ever received at IG. They knew my roomie and I by name and would bring us free samosas when we came in. Waiters were always personable and friendly, and the food is FANTASTIC. We'd split an order of naan and get 2 entrees, and usually we'd end up with enough leftovers for a good meal the next day. The ambiance is also super cool, with Indian music videos in the background. Parking isn't easy, so be prepared to either pay for a garage or take a bus! The walk there takes you right through South Oakland, so be careful and take a friend if you're going for half-price at night!"}
{"text":"I didn't feel up to sitting in a restaurant for a meal, so I phoned in a takeout order. The woman politely took my order of three items, asked about the degree of spiciness and told me it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. When I showed up 20 minutes later, four employees were chatting behind the bar. One asked me whether I wanted to order something. I told them I called in an order and gave them my name. They look at each other with puzzled faces. One man asked if I placed the order online and I told him I had phoned it in. Someone else riffled through some papers and said quietly, \"Oh, murgh makhani.\" She looked up and slipped into the kitchen. I said, \"You haven't made this yet, have you\" to which another person replied, \"Oh it will only take 2 minutes.\" I said \"No thanks\" and left. I could understand if they had been busy, but they wasn't a single patron inside! No apology, nothing."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food awaits you inside the unassuming building that houses India Garden.  Not only was everything we ordered amazing, but the staff was super friendly and seemed genuinely interested in making sure we had a nice time.  When we asked about the tandoori oven, they even let us peek inside the kitchen to see how they made the naan, which, by the way, is cooked in the traditional way by sticking the dough to the sides of their deep clay oven!  If you're a naan fan, this is definitely the place for you...SO GOOD!  You can order your food on a spiciness scale from 1-10.  My parents were not interested in spice, so they ordered 1 and were very happy.  My husband and I ordered 3 because we were sharing, but I would probably have ordered 5 on my own.  You can ask for a reference if you aren't sure.  Our waitress told us to try a sauce that she considered about 5-6.  I didn't think to take photos, but I would recommend everything we ordered: samosas (2 large ones - we were happy to share 2 among 4 of us since we knew we had more coming!), chicken mango curry, Aloo Gobhi (cauliflower and potatoes), Chana Saag (chickpeas with spinach - this is what I chose and it was rich and delicious - highly recommend if you like that kind of thing!), and Chicken Biryani.  We also had 3 garlic naan, which were huge and more than enough for 4 of us, and raita.  There was plenty for sharing, and we even brought home leftovers for another delicious day or two!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for Indian food...especially in lakewood, oh. They have a pretty big menu with all the basics. Started out with some samosas and vegetable pakora...they were decent, but needed more veggie and a little less potato in each.  For the main, I always go with a chicken vindaloo and my brother with the lamb. Definitely make it spicy, but always risky telling and Indian guy you like it spicey. Fortunately, he nailed it and was a really good couple of dishes. Like the appetizers though, little less potato and little more...well, meat in this case...  It doesn't. look ike much from he outside, but nice on the inside with friendly service. They do need to realize though that filling the water every 2 minutes is not necessary...at least when ordering dinner...an keep it full during the lunch buffet.   Would hit ths place again sometime if I am in lakewood."}
{"text":"Just love this place!  Wonderful for both my meat-eating hubby and me (vegetarian.)  We also like that they will make dishes however spicy or mild you like.  Another review mentioned limited vegetarian options, but I thought they had lots of choices - 2 pages of main entrees for vegetarians, in addition to the yummy appetizers.  Our favorite Indian food in the area!"}
{"text":"There is a reason that this India Garden has won awards, including \"The Best of Cleveland\": the dishes are tasty, the menu is extensive, the food is flavorful, and the staff is warm and welcoming. As much as I like hot food, I can only handle a #2 spice level.   If you're hungry for lunch, you can't beat the buffet. It is all you can eat!   I go to NYC regularly and haven't found an Indian restaurant better than India Garden."}
{"text":"Stopped by this nice joint in Cleveland, and it was pretty beyond our expectations. The inside is much larger than how it looks from outside, and it has very authentic interior decors. We got seated by friendly customer service, and our food didn't take much time to come. They actually customize your dish according to your spice preference level, although even mild can be very spicy. We tried the paneer butter makhani, vegetable jalfrezi, naan and served with rice. The paneer was really good in a thick creamy sauce, and the vegetable jalfrezi was in a tomato sauce but super spicy. The naan was good but burnt all around the edges. They give huge portion so expect to take home leftovers. Definetely would recommend this place to anyone looking for some Indian food."}
{"text":"Food is average. Tamarind on N. Craig has better food....but is more expensive. Udipi in Monroeville hands down has the best Indian food in the Pittsburgh region. The service at India Garden is VERY slow during peak dinner hours on Fri/Sat. I ordered take out and they said over the phone that it would be 25 minutes. 1 HOUR later I was still standing in their bar area waiting for my food to come out. Although the manager apologized, it was still unacceptable."}
{"text":"This was the first Indian restaurant  I  tried in Pittsburgh and I was impressed by the quality and quantity of food. I am an Indian and have eaten Indian food else where in the US (mostly midwest) and I was satisfied with the quality of food here. I ordered a vegeterian Thali, the amount of food given in a vegetarian Thali is a lot and I had a hard time finishing it. Overall the food is good. I felt that the service can be improved in terms of time it takes for them to serve. Music is too loud there (trust me it is not like this in India nor do we have TVs in restaurants in India) .   The majority of the crowd here are students from CMU or PITT. They have happy hours where certain items on the menu are half the price, so you can try out several things for less."}
{"text":"Probably my most favorite Indian restaurant to date, and I've only eaten there once.  The reason for the 4 stars is that the walk to the restaurant was kind of through a sketchy neighborhood.  I didn't feel comfortable walking it alone.  Other than that, I ordered the chicken vidaloo and garlic naan and it was absolutely delicious.  I took my order back to my hotel room, and was quite surprised to see the amount they gave me.  More than enough for 3 people I think.  I did my civil duty (since it was on the company card) and ate as much as I could..  it was divine.  The waiters that worked there were quite nice as well, asking me to take a seat while my order was waiting and offering refreshments.  A+ (except for the neighborhood)"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is never a letdown! Always so much for and all of great quality. Very friendly service, too! Don't miss the rice pudding."}
{"text":"I like India Garden although I don't frequent here too often as it's a little pricey. Many of the entrees on the menu cost around $13 to $17. Add in the cost for naan, an appetizer or alcohol and it adds up pretty quickly. That being said, I think the food is tasty. While the prices are somewhat high, the portions of the entrees are generously sized allowing you to enjoy leftovers. 2 glasses of wine, splitting an appetizer, garlic naan and paneer tikka set me back about $35. Of course if you're just picking up takeout and one entree and naan, you can get out of there spending less than $20.   The vegetable sampler appetizer is okay, but not great. The samosas are pretty great, but I can skip the fried veggies that are included.  The naan is fantastic. I particularly like the garlic naan. It's soft and well flavored (not too strongly flavored with garlic).The entrees are all flavorful. Medium spicy is relatively hot so be careful when you order if you don't like heat. I've never dared to get anything hotter than medium. Honestly, the dishes have enough flavor that you don't really NEED the heat.    I was there on a Sunday night (Nov. 30, 2014) and every table was full with a few people waiting to be seated. It's a small restaurant, but cozy. Service is very good. Our server was helpful in suggesting items on the menu for someone who hadn't tried Indian food previously.    They have beer, wine and limited booze selection (gin, vodka).   They offer takeout, and a lunch buffet which I've never had the chance to try."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. First visit. Clean restaurant. Friendly staff. Small buffet 9.99 While most was different than we are used to, (just moved from Houston, Tx) everything was very good. 3 meat dishes, the rest veggies. 2 desserts.  We will be back"}
{"text":"India Garden's lunch buffet gave me the opportunity to try a variety of dishes in small portions for which I thank them.  I've discovered a love for cauliflower (Aloo Gobhi) and chick peas (Chana Saag) because of the way they prepare them, and I've figured out that their Chicken Tikka Masala is the best I've ever had anywhere. I dress most dishes with Raita and Mango Chutney which are fresh and flavorful whether they're on the buffet or ordered with my dinner.  I appreciate that they also offer a spicy tea (Masala Chai) and even rice pudding (Kheer) during lunch.  I found out the hard way that dinner portions are enough for three people and have learned not to over order sides (but it's so hard because I want everything and cannot always narrow it down!).  I highly recommend the saffron rice when ordering dinner (it's always flavorful and perfectly prepared).    The service here is top notch (so polite and accommodating); I find the staff to be friendly, efficient, and fast.  Even when they are busy, they handle customers with an elegance and grace unmatched by competitors."}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have ever eaten!!! The best service I've ever had at a restaurant. I highly recommend the chicken tikki masala, Chana saag, garlic naan...you can't go wrong though with any order. The best food in Lakewood!!! A must!"}
{"text":"Have dined here twice now and I have to say that overall I am pleased.  The food at the buffet is always hot and fresh and does not sit for long.  The buffet is a tad bit smaller than most however.    The server was very attentive with always making surenour drinks were full and that we had hot fresh naan.    The food itself was great. A tad bit milder than what I have grown accustomed to,  but one must allow for all palates.    Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I've taken several friends who have never tried Indian food here and every single one has loved it. There are plenty of vegetarian options and while I haven't tried them all, I have yet to taste a bad dish. All meals are spiced to your specification, and while they normally do a good job, sometimes the spice can be inconsistent. Highly recommended anyhow!"}
{"text":"My Indian food experience is fairly limited.  But this is the best one that I have been too!  Fresh and enjoyable!"}
{"text":"We were heading back home (Altoona) from Pittsburgh. Must say, they are one of the best Indian food in United States. We ordered Veg Samosa and Aloo Puri Chaat for starters, bread basket and Paneer Tikka Makhani for the main course and Ras Malai for desserts. Food was delicious and clean. Ambience is too good! Must visit."}
{"text":"While it doesn't look like much from the outside the interior is pretty nice but fairly small. With only several tables it can get a bit crowded.  I am a novice when it comes to Indian food but they do a great job explaining the dishes and spice levels. They start every table out with what I believe is papidum (crispy cracker like bread) and some sauces. The one sauce was far too spicy to me and I was informed that it was a level 7, so I made sure to request a level 3-4 when it came to ordering my dish. I have come to love their Chicken Tikka Masala and Saag Paneer.  The wait staff are friendly and efficient and always checking to make sure that you are enjoying your experience.  They also have takeout and while my boyfriend and I prefer to eat in the quaint establishment the line for takeout is never ending but people are in and our quickly with their tasty dishes in hand.  One of these days I hope to make it for their lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Delicious, not heavy or greasy, perfect spice, great service! We had it for take out and will definitely return, yumm!"}
{"text":"The curry chicken is amazing. The staff is very friendly. Make sure to try their different varieties of bread, amazing to say the least. Best Indian food in the west valley."}
{"text":"We love Indian food and have been to a few different restaurants in the past, but this one is a winner! The lunch buffet is phenomenal!  will come back soon!"}
{"text":"Pathetic food and too small servings. Everything we ordered is tasteless and under cooked."}
{"text":"Solid lunch buffet with naan, pakoras, about 6 veggie dishes, 3 chicken, and 1 goat curry.  Service was iffy - we sometimes waited a while for our drinks to be refilled, and it wasn't really clear that we had to go up to the counter to pay until we saw someone else do it.  It was really quiet, which I was not expecting based on the other reviews.  The matar paneer and the tofu palak were good, the aloo gobi and the chana masala were good, the dish with the baby potatoes was ok.  The salad bar section was under a green light so it was hard to tell what everything was, and not everything was labeled.  There was a $3 off two lunch buffets coupon in the Clipper magazine, but it still came to $18.  Either they're charging a LOT for soda or the buffet is more expensive than it says it is on the website.  But the food was pretty good and I'd definitely be willing to come back during the 1/2 off hours."}
{"text":"Highly recommended for Indian food close to downtown Cleveland. Staff is friendly and place is clean.   Garlic Naan was a great portion and had a perfect amount of flavor. I had the Chicken Tikka Tandori, which I could only decribe as fajita-style Chicken Tikka Masala. Had the same sauce as my dining partner's Chicken Tikka Masala, but mine was twice the size for approximately the same price. I loved being able to dictate how much sauce was on it, and it made for a lot easier leftovers. Highly recommend both dishes, but especially the Tandori,   I have yet to find better Indian food around the downtown Cleveland area."}
{"text":"The buffet was good! Decent prices. I'll definitely be back, its nice to have good Indian food on the west side of town."}
{"text":"We got take out & the food was just ok.  The first time I called to order the guy said \"we are not serving dinners\"  I was confused since I called at 5pm.  But my boyfriend called back and was able to placed an order.   The food had good flavor but the rice was dry & not enough sauce with the lamb vindaloo.  The mango lassi tasted liked it was from a can & a little sour. The garlic naahn was soft & didn't have a fresh garlic taste to it.   We may try it again but dine in since it is the only Indian restaurant in my area."}
{"text":"Very good food. Seems like it's a family run restaurant so it feels very comfortable."}
{"text":"Some friends introduced us to India Garden a couple months ago, we've been back twice since then. Best Indian food I've had in the west valley. We've never ordered anything we didn't like. We will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"Quite possible some of the best Indian food I've ever had. Add to that some of the friendliest staff members you'll ever encounter, this place is a home run. I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo. I like it hot. I got 10 on a 0-10 scale. Fabulous flavor. Just the right amount of spice. It didn't hide any of the flavor. I absolutely echo other posters who've indicated that the garlic naan is outrageously good. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian restaurant! We travel cross town to indulge in their fine hospitality, varied menu, perfectly spiced scrumptious dishes.  We love India Garden!"}
{"text":"If you like Indian food or are in the mood to try it, I would highly recommend. They have some great dishes, or just get the buffet to try a little bit of it all. It is a small restaurant and buffet, but definitely worth the trip. The service is more European, so you may have to flag down your waiter to order or get the bill. I was okay with this. I spent a semester abroad and actually really like the less in your face way restaurants are run in other countries. You don't feel rushed and dining out feels like an experience :)"}
{"text":"Have you ever asked someone if they liked Indian food and to your surprise they make a weird face and say, \"Ewwww... no!\"? I have a theory; India Garden is where they had their first taste of Indian Food.  To be fair, I ate buffet, not an actual menu item.  Menu is always better than buffet.  However, this was awful.  It almost tasted to me like a non-Indian was doing their  best to make Indian food with common American kitchen items.  I swear the baingan bharta tasted and looked like it had mayo in it.    There are better options in the Cleveland area for Indian food."}
{"text":"My first impression was not good. There was only one server for the whole resturant, and he was swamped and couldn't make it to our table very often (thank god for the young man filling waters) the chutney was brought out without any explanation what kind they were and my wife ate the one with green chilies that was very hot, and she can't do very spicy foods. The server rushed us to order and didn't address any questions we had, and eventually just sent the manager over to finish taking our order. The food took about 30 minutes, which is fine for homemade food. When the food came it was warm but not hot. The taste was ok, spices were right on, but the rice was very bland and meat was kind of dry. We also order d garlic naan, and it was dripping oil and partly soggy. After the food was finished we waited another 45 minutes to get our bill and boxes despite holding our cards out. I have eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants all over the country, this place is the worst and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"First time here and first time for Indian cuisine. A friend told me that it was the best Indian food she has ever tried so I tried it. I ordered take out. They were so nice and friendly. They offered me tea while I waited. I had the chicken korma with rice. It was so flavorful and delish. Can't wait to go back and try other dishes. They had a huge selection of dishes to try."}
{"text":"I'm a glutton for spicy food, so naturally I was drawn to this Indian restaurant. On my first visit, I ordered the food extra spicy and was truly pleased! This is definitely the place for spice lovers, such as myself. However, regardless of your spice preference they have a dish for all palates. My personal favorite is the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan.   I've become a regular here, and it's not just due to proximity because I'm the type of person that doesn't mind driving a little extra for great food. The service is excellent. I really enjoy the environment. The staff is always very welcoming, and they've come to recognize me and my friends."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Hindi joints. The food is really good although I am not a fan of the buffet for various reasons I do love their chicken tikka masala that I order fresh to go due to the fact that the chicken tikka masala you order is chicken breast and the one at the buffet is chicken thigh. I only eat chicken breast therefore I always have to order my chicken tikka masala rather than have it at the buffet. Otherwise, the chicken tikka masala is delicious and I love that they add Bill peppers to it."}
{"text":"This used to be my staple option for Indian food before Mint opened. I have had the buffet several times which has good variety but average quality at its best. Sometimes they take way too much time to refill the curries during buffet. If it was only for buffet, I'd probably rate them 2. However, if you're ordering things from the menu, for instance lamb curry or chicken karahi, they do a far better job. But then if you go too fancy and try something fancy from their menu, the food comes out as a mixture of few curries rather than the original. So in summary, if you're Indian, you know what the staple is and stick to it. If you're not, stick to chicken karahi, lamb curry, vindaloo, and chicken biryani."}
{"text":"Best example of how one should not judge a book by its cover... Just stopped by for a quick bite!! The best pakoras I've had! Frsh crunchy tasty and totally satisfying the craving!! A must Have!"}
{"text":"Maybe we were spoiled by some excellent Indian restaurants in Cincinnati but Indian Garden did not live up to the reviews on here. Compared to other buffets we have been to, the offering is very limited. The chicken in the masala and curry was not breast meat as advertised. My girlfriend is picky about only liking white meat so this was an issue for her. I'm not very picky and even I found the meat to be lower in quality. The flavors were average if not a bit bland. I am rating the restaurant a 2 purely based off of good service. The naan was the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"Another great lunch buffet at India Garden. Food is good, service is better. Indian food isn't my favorite food out there but when I do get a craving for it, this is the place I go."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with Rand H. and found this place to be above average for an east indian restaurant .The restaurant it self is big and very well decorated and the food was good.The trays that stood out the most were Keema Matar,Chicken Makhni,some kind of potato and cabbage dish and the naan was very good as well. When I left this place i was full and happy so Yay I am a fan.Not many Indian choices in Goodyear but lucky for them they have India Garden."}
{"text":"nice sized buffet with solid indian food.  2 buffets and 2 sodas came priced at under $24 for late lunch.  the food is hearty and after 2 plates we were both stuffed.  it's enjoyable trying different indian dishes and each one was pretty good.  i especially enjoyed the chicken dishes and the naan is made a little flakey and soft at the same time.  the one thing that bugged me was the bathroom toilette was clogged and it seemed a little dirty.  the restaurant itself is cute.  i'd happily go back.  next time i'll try 1 of the house drinks."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food.  We had spicy and we had mild and it was all great. The service was very enjoyable and prompt."}
{"text":"Really good service!!  I had to start out with that because the past couple of places we visited although the food was good, service unimpressive at best.  We had their lunch buffet and the food was fresh, even in the late afternoon towards the end of the buffet time.  They brought us fresh naan and came by to see how we were doing.  Maybe it was because we had a cute kid with us but we felt very welcomed there.    Good service, good food.  It doesn't get much better than that."}
{"text":"Love this place! We always have a great experience and the food is excellent. Everyone is pleasant and I'd highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet on a Saturday after a hike at Rocky River. I loved the food in the buffet, it was very fresh tasting and I could tell the ingredients were good quality, especially for the price. The service was also excellent-- they brought fresh naan to the table for us, and the waiter was very nice and personable. I will definitely come back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"awsome naan garlic bread. the service was awesome. we had a large party of 12 during lunch and we all had the buffet. the mango lasi was good too."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! The food is great and can't beat their lunch buffet! Try the mango lassi here! The staff is also very friendly!"}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Cleveland! Definitely a must try place in Cleveland area (Lakewood). Never disappoints. I get something different every time and every dish has been delicious and full of flavor. Recommend getting the samosas for a starter and garlic naan with your meal. Nice, quaint, cozy environment inside."}
{"text":"Six months had passed since our one-star experience, we really wanted Indian, and the pickings in the SW valley are slim. So we headed out to India Garden to give them another shot.  The service was friendly if a little bit slow, and the food was good. The place was so dimly lit, however, that I got a bit of an eyestrain headache just reading the menu.  In all, decent enough to make it silly to drive a half hour to find another Indian place. I will be back, but mostly for the lunch buffet, which has always been good."}
{"text":"Amazing. The best Indian food I have had in Cleveland so far. I love Indian food and so does my friend Sanjay, whom as you might have guessed is Indian from India! We end up eating here at least twice a month and have tried several dishes as well as the buffet. I have nothing but good things to say. Every dish is flavorful- spice is on point when you ask for it. Dishes are made with love and are always fresh and tasty! Portions are very generous- prices are very reasonable for quality. The owner and staff are so kind and welcoming- always attentive to make sure everything is to your liking. Hands down - great place to eat or grab take out."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! Service is great! Very clean place.  Prices are reasonable! I highly recommend this place.  The owner is so nice.  They cater, too."}
{"text":"I guess I'm in the minority, but I was never all that impressed with this place.  The best Indian food in Pittsburgh?  Hardly.  I found it pretty low quality, not very fresh, kind of greasy.  The staff was pretty unfriendly, I didn't feel welcome there.  The one redeeming quality is that it's half price after 10pm, but it's often packed, dark and loud by that time.  It's a decent place if you're having a night out in Oakland and want some cheap drunk food after hitting the bars, but other than that I'd avoid it."}
{"text":"Despite having a shabby exterior and being located in an ugly strip mall outside of Pittsburgh, India Garden has a nice ambiance inside and a good buffet of Indian curries. The chicken, fish, goat, and vegetarian curries were all very fresh and tasty, and the naan was excellent. Friendly waiters, although a bit slow at taking used plates away. If you find yourself in Monroeville as I did, and you're in want of some Indian curry, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tasty food for a good price, but the service is spotty. I once called to order to go, and the guy taking the order was a bit rude and snappy. I've ordered from them a few times, though, and can't complain about the tasty food.  There's an evening discount on their food, by the way."}
{"text":"Yay! This is going to be my new to-go Indian restaurant.   I have eaten here twice now and I really enjoyed it every time. I dined in once then got take out the next week. I'm a vegetarian and really liked both the malai kofta and vegetable jalfrazie. They were just the right amount of spicy. They also have very tasty naan (and garlic naan!) and I love the raita (yogurt sauce). If you eat in, you also get some tasty chip-like-things (sorry for not knowing what they're called!) and tasty sauces.   Staff here is very nice! Super attentive and friendly every time. It hasn't been very busy when I've been here so that probably helps but you can tell they really are trying to make sure you have a great time. Food is also prepared quite quickly!   The only issue I've seen is that my boyfriend got the same dish at the same spice levels both times he went there but they did not taste like the same level of spiciness. The second time, it was far too spicy for his taste. He still enjoyed it but it's pretty inconvenient to learn that a 5 is perfect for your taste then go back to have the 5 be too spicy!   Overall, though, I love this place!"}
{"text":"On my first visit to India Garden, I was able to try the lunch buffet which offered an excellent selection off their menu. We were thrilled with the basmati rice, chicken makhni, chicken tandoori, vegetable pakora, and the Matter Paneer was especially delicious. The raita and the chutneys were very good but keep in mind that everything here is exceptionally mild for Indian fare. The food is extremely good and the restaurant is gorgeous, very clean, and the staff is very attentive. Also, you do get complimentary garlic naan with the buffet. The mango lassi I ordered was sweet and refreshing. Overall India Garden was a great dining experience. I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food at lunch buffet. Only had buffet so far(twice). Friendly service.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The service here seemed kind of spotty.  The wait staff seemed upset and frustrated that I was eating at their restaurant.  Maybe this was because I was requesting ridiculous, difficult things...like a beer with my meal (I know, I know, I'm a terrible, crazy person for even thinking of doing something like that).  Speaking of beer, the drink menu said $1 drafts all day.  Crazy, $1 drafts?  I couldn't believe it.  Well, when I got my check, my $1 draft cost me $4.  Meh, that's not a bad price for what I got, but it would've been nice if I hadn't have been mislead about the price of beer.  Oh well.  I'm still giving this place 3 stars, because if you're okay with poor service , this is a good place to grab a meal.  They have a $9.99 dinner buffet that's probably the best value unless there's a specific dish you want or you really want made-to-order food.  Everything in the buffet was flavorful, although it certainly wasn't the best Indian food I've ever had.  As far as spiciness goes, all the buffet food was around medium - not too mild, but certainly not hot.  There were a good variety of dishes in the buffet - I'd estimate somewhere around 8-10 main dishes plus a variety of sides.  Overall, the food is good, but there's definitely better Indian food out there.  Also, be prepared for less-than-stellar service."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food! The manager is a fantastic host who was able to accommodate. New favorite place!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo good, amazing food and terrific service! Chicken korma and the mango lassi were delicious, I need to come back and try their lunch buffet, the owner says they change their buffet items daily."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is a great value and a good way to sample different dishes to see what you like. Ordering any other time is way over-priced. Sometimes the owner seems a little annoyed to have customers, weird."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've ever had. Also, possibly the worst service at any restaurant I've experienced. Almost walked out due to an hour wait. Unless its for their buffet, I won't go back."}
{"text":"What happened? They have to have a new owner) because the prices are still high, and the food was AWFUL. First of all: I waited 3 hours for my meal. It came cold, there was no spice) I ordered a 7) and the delivery guy forgot my soda I paid for, and acted like it wasn't a problem and told me \"Maybe next time\" I tried to call, I guess they closed for the night because noone picked up or they are busy. I'm kind of offended.... wow. Okay, that's it for me, and the worst review I've ever written."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. I don't understand how you can offer a Sunday buffet, close it in 2 and a half hours. I came in half they way through it, and several of the dishes were dried out. The rice was dry and chewy. The best part was the salad and the bread. Not what I hoped for at all."}
{"text":"I had vegetarian takeout and it was Not the best Indian food I've had but it was still good! The rice was bland and I found several dark hairs in the food, which doesn't gross me out as much as it does others. But the food overall definetly satisfied my Indian food craving."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab lunch! The service is always friendly and attentive, the food is delicious and authentic! And for only $10, you can't beat the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good buffet, good service, excellent food. Can't say enough good things about it."}
{"text":"My intense enthusiasm for India Garden comes from its complete absence of competition on this side of town. If I had given into my inner fanboy squee and yelped,  \"OH, THANK GOD, I CAN GET A KORMA WITHOUT DRIVING TWENTY MILES!\" then I certainly would have given it four stars.    It's like the guy who sells you beer in prison: Is it any good?  Who cares?  It's beer, man, and it'd be too much trouble to brew your own hooch.  Hence, India Garden wins for being the sole provider - it's the Windows 95 of restaurants.    As it is, what we have here is pretty darned average Indian food.  Which is not to say that it's bad Indian food - it's really quite tasty, as Indian food is wont to be.  I eat here twice a month, because dangit, what they provide works.  If you like Indian food, this will not let you down.    And like all good Indian restaurants, it has takeout for those evenings you just need some spice at home, and a good and darned cheap lunch buffet which I recommend for those days out.    These guys are brute efficient, working to satisfy the palate; they do their job with a thorough competence, if not necessarily flair.  it's the definition of A-OK, as it says on the handy-dandy star rating bar above me, and by God it's worth your time to go here because they ARE here.    Keep them in business.  They do good work."}
{"text":"We usually come for the dinner buffet since it's the best deal. Depending on when you come there might be full hot dishes or dried up remains. Large selection and generally good quality and taste (when the pans are full and not picked through) but does vary some.   Service tends to be awful."}
{"text":"I like Indian food, but my wife was never a big fan.  We had gone to another Indian restaurant a couple of times and she didn't really care for it, so she was always reluctant to give this place a try.  I got her to come by choosing to go here for my birthday and now she likes Indian food.  One nice thing about this place is that you can choose how spicy you like things on a scale of 1-10 (I've heard that you can even ask them to go even higher than 10).  Last time I came I had the saag chana and it was tasty.  I'm also a fan of the spicy daal soup."}
{"text":"Amazing service and the food is delicious- one of my favorite spots for Indian. It's definitely a hidden gem in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"India Garden is the best place ever. I love them and they are magicians. You haven't lived til you try their saag paneer (vegetarian) or chicken saag. Go there right now."}
{"text":"I love the foods of India; the curries, the naan, the spices and sauces that speak of rich food for a rich palate.   Keeping that in mind, when I stopped off for a bite at India Garden, I didn't know what to expect.   I was pleasantly surprised.  Firstly, their parking is rather small, and you'd not know the establishment was even there, except for a large sign by the street. When I went in, I was greeted and seated and then TREATED to a very nice buffet, from butter chicken to vegetable curry, hot chai tea on tap, and garlic naan that was given out so rapidly and well, you'd have thought it manna from heaven:) The staff and management was very attentive and courteous.   The food was very good, and their buffet wasn't huge, but didn't need to be as the diversity of dishes was very appealing.   The atmosphere in this small, cozy restaurant would be good for a date or a lunch getaway, and their regular menu is quite diverse.   All and all, take a walk in the Garden and I think you'll come back very satisfied:)"}
{"text":"Great indian on the fly! quick and friendly service food was great nothing really special that makes them stand out compared to others but the price was right and and the place was clean I heard they have a 7.99 all you can eat lunch buffet 7 days a week thats a huge plus! would I return yes but I think  I will continue my quest to find the ultamate indian food restaurant in ohio!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this buffet for years, ever since Sutra in Goodyear closed.   Unfortunately, it looks like this place is on a similar path.  Sutra was pretty good when it opened, but then kept changing owners.  Each time it changed hands, the food quality dropped until it was borderline inedible and ultimately closed.  India Garden USED to have a great buffet with delicious bright curries, including one with Mahi Mahi that would melt in your mouth.  But that ship has sailed.  The waitress said it has been the same owners for 5 years which I don't believe.  If true, then the owners have decided to cut costs which is reflected in the food.  Eggplant curry was slimy, chicken curry and meatball curry (beef??) should not be called curries, they are literally sitting in a pool of grease.   Veg pakora is either undercooked or loaded with a doughy filler.  They used to bring out a decent garlic naan, now they serve plain naan that tasted very blah.  Even Diet Pepsi was flat and tasted like a cola substitute.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had gone to India last December and as the one-year mark was coming up, we were getting in the mood for some authentic Indian food. And India Garden did not disappoint. The food was very reminiscent of what we had in the northern parts of the country (including the spice level!). We started of with the Samosas ($3.95) which, as expected, were really not spicy at all. They had a crispy outer layer but moist potatoes and peas inside. For main courses, my wife ordered the Chicken Korma ($12.95) and I had the Goat Biryani (14.95). The waiter lets you decide how spicy you want it on a scale of 1 to 10. My wife, being of Irish descent, quickly said \"1\" while I usually find myself enjoying just above average heat so I picked \"6.\" Hers was perfectly tasty with no heat while I noticed the kick of pepper in my rice dish with the first bite. I probably would have rated the heat at least an \"8.\"  But I enjoyed it and we are looking forward to having rest of our meals for breakfast as the portion sizes were huge. Maybe next time we'll get two appetizers and one entree to split. India Garden also has beer, wine and mixed drink menu that looked OK but I'm not a beer drinker so I can't tell if there were any hidden gems in the list. The decor of the restaurant included the typical replications of 1700s drawings and photos of famous landmarks but obviously the effort was being focused more on the food than the ambiance."}
{"text":"YUMMMMMMMM.... Love this place. Wait staff are sweet people.. Nice clean quiet restaurant with great food.. Watch out it can get spicy!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food in Cleveland. They have amazing buffet during the week. Nun is awesome!"}
{"text":"Absolutely obsessed with this place. Always fresh, full of flavor, and fantastic service. I make it a point to come here every time I am in town."}
{"text":"I have been going to India Garden for the past 15 years for their lunch buffet. While in the past they tended to be hit or miss as far as the quality of their food, unfortunately now they are not very good at all. The past year I have visited them 5 times and each and every time the food has been bland and boring. Most of the dishes are basically sauce with very little substance. Indian food should be amazing when done correctly and unfortunately India a garden has chosen the \"safe\" route by appealing to American taste buds, at least with their buffet. They are under the same ownership so the only reason I can think of for this drastic change is a necessity for cost savings and catering to the American pallet. I also noticed that the Indian contingent of customers has slacked off to almost none, the obvious reason being that the buffet is so unauthentic now. This is truly unfortunate as they used to be one of the best Indian buffets in the Cleveland area.  Sadly, this will be my last time going here as there are much better options now that have opened in the past few years."}
{"text":"I'm really in a quandary here, I believe this place to be a 3.5, so I'm on the low side of the middle.  The case for: The food was pretty darn good. I wouldn't say amazing. The naan was solid, the samosas were solid, we tried their version of chicken strips (which were a little weird, but fair enough); Randy S. had a good spinach dish, mine was chicken vindaloo, which was pretty darn good. It's open late, lots of Indian people there, which is at least reassuring and also makes the experience more Indian.   The case against: It's pretty average in terms of Indian food. It would be a place I would be happy to go if I felt like Indian food and someone suggested it, but I can't imagine really beating a path there. It was almost impossible to find parking too.   I think I'm going to keep it at 3, but it's recommended. I would have no hesitance to say it's good and someone should go if they are looking for good Indian in P-burgh. It's just a little average."}
{"text":"Terrible experience on a Tuesday night. We arrived for dinner and stood around not knowing whether to wait to be seated or sit at any table (we did the latter).  Started off by ordering Mango Lassi and it was below average quality. More watery and thin instead of being creamy and possibly not considered \"fresh\" as the menu description says.  and the food took forever! my god, we finished ordering by 6:30 and finally received our orders at 7:20. over 45 minutes. the venue was only at 20% capacity with 4 tables of customers and a guy waiting for a to-go order he ordered beforehand, so it's problematic to think this restaurant would be able to handle a full house or a few large groups if it couldn't handle a slow night.  and when we finally received our food, we can instantly tell that we've seen better Indian food at other places. The food was not \"fresh off the kitchen\" as our 3 dishes were already cooled down to just warm and began to be cold before we even finished. The portions were small for the price and the ingredients used were sub-grade. (we could tell that the shrimp was frozen and didn't mix all the way with the sauce)  add the fact that we waited this long for our order and not feel satisfied by it is disheartening as you receive the bill.  Disappointing experience because this is the only Indian restaurant in the area of the West Valley (Goodyear, Avondale, etc.) before the next ones in Glendale and Phoenix. I suggest to skip convenience if you're eating with a group and make the drive to the better ones located in Phoenix."}
{"text":"We went here for my fiancées birthday because he loves Indian food. It did not disappoint. The garlic naan was very good, service was attentive, and they even gave us extra rice to take home with our leftovers. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The only downside was that we went early on a Sunday evening, and there were only two or three other tables occupied.   They have takeout available. We will definitely return for the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here for the 1st time tonight and overall very good!  Indian is not my favorite food but what I had was good.  My wife and mother really seemed to enjoy it as well. - I like the plain nan vs. the nan with Garlic.  We will certainly be back, thanks!"}
{"text":"THE spot to get Indian food on the west side of Cleveland. The buffet never disappoints and the food is always hot and great. The spice levels vary which is great. Staff always nice and quick with service. The best!!"}
{"text":"Ate there for lunch several weeks ago with a (Indian) friend from work.  The lunch buffet was really good - excellent variety.  It was all tasty, but I think their cooks' specialties must be the vegetarian stuff.  There were also several Indians there for lunch - always a good sign when an ethnic restaurant attracts its respective community.  (Double points if they're recent immigrants who weren't raised on Burger King and Red Lobster like me and all of my friends.)"}
{"text":"Tried the lunch buffet on a Sunday afternoon. Fairly crowded. Really big selection of Indian favs and some I had never tried. Not very spicy but they have a bowl of homemade chili sauce that will surely kick it up a notch. Good experience and reliable service/food. Strong air freshener in bathroom and fairly clean."}
{"text":"This place is not bad! I was looking for a place to eat for vegetarian Monday's and not this place did not disappoint. I like the naan bread they served, it tastes like it's made within the facility. The naan bread is comparable color to Matzos but the texture is soft when you bite into it. I ate it with the curry dishes and the combination went well.  The curries and salad bar looks fresh in the buffet line. There are different sauces that you can add with your meal. The restaurant is clean and wait staff are friendly. I didn't have ask to refill up my water glass. They automatically check on your dining experience and making sure everything is okay. If you are looking for a colorful in your taste palette food this is the place."}
{"text":"This has been my choice Indian restaurant for over a decade. Recent trips have seen a decline in India Garden's service.  Food was fine. But the experience overall was lackluster.   As long as I can remember, this and every other Indian restaurant I've been to serves complimentary papadum. This is no longer the case at Indian Garden. My girlfriend ordered a drink, which was never brought out. Water was never refilled. Sure, we could have asked a staff member - if one had come around at all. Very inattentive - even after the food came, the server did not check in at all, see if we needed anything, etc.  When the bill came, we were charged for the beverage that we never received - then looked upon suspiciously when we brought it to the cashier's attention. We also had a Groupon which had expired. As stated on the Groupon, if the deal has expired, the voucher is redeemable for the value paid (in this case $12.50). The manager refused to accept it.  The meal wasn't bad, but the service was awful. It's a shame - IG has long been one of my very favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh, but now it's time to explore other options for Indian food."}
{"text":"Recently me and a friend of mine when here for the lunch buffet.  While we ate most of the lunch items provided, I decided to dig in to the sweet section. I found \"gulab jamun\" (fried dough in sugar syrup) and decided to get some. As I took a big spoonful and put it in my bowl, I found a COCKROACH in the bowl. I informed the lady working there and asked her to dispose off the entire bowl they had served. I am not sure if this was done, as they promptly brought the bowl outside.   She asked me to try it again- To which I promptly refused.  ."}
{"text":"This place is amazeballs!!! Costumer service is incredible the ladies and the man which I'm assuming is the owner make you feel like family. They let us try their mango drink which surpasses any other mango drink that I've ever mangoed. I'm not an Indian food critic by any means but this place took me on a 16 hour flight to India where I had delicious food in a very welcoming atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great food.  And a fun place.  It's like being in India which I have visited several times.  Saturday night is the best.  They have a great buffet for lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious inexpensive Indian food. Yeah, they bring on the heat...but if you like it a hot and crave Indian food like I do, then you must hit India Garden.  The service is good, but the food just hits the spot. At $8.95 for an all you can eat lunch buffet, you can take the risk and dig in. They usually have 4 vegetarian dishes and 4 meat dishes complimented by a mess of sauces/condiments, naan and rice.   Live the good life, enjoy a little India Garden..."}
{"text":"I went there on a Sunday and all they had was a buffet. The food was bland and not spicy at all. The service was poor too."}
{"text":"We generally came to this place for late night half off which is typical in the Oakland area in Pittsburgh.  The food was generally good (get the Aloo Gobi), but what was really a let down was the service. During late night, the staff is not attentive, slow at times and feels cold.  Otherwise, the atmosphere felt fun with Indian music videos constantly playing in the back."}
{"text":"Still my favorite Indian place in the Cleveland area.  I almost always get Saag with veggie pakora and garlic naan.  Other items I've tried have always been just as delicious.  They will adjust the spice to your liking from none to a ear steaming.  The service seems to get a little better each time I've been.  You never feel forgotten like I have at other Indian places in town.    The flavors are rich, the colors are vibrant, the portions are generous, the atmosphere is cute,  and they have a nice little patio if that's your bag.  I also really like that they don't have a TV running in the place."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out since we love Indian food. We were very disappointed with the food here. If your gonna charge $13 for a chicken dish and then an extra  $3 for rice then at least give a bigger portion. The portion was very small and very bland. My chicken korma had the amount of chicken to equal 1 thigh.  My girlfriend ordered a $14 shrimp dish and it had 5 pieces of small shrimp. To me that is ripping people off and is wrong of a restaurant to do that.  The 4 and five stars have to be from people who have only eaten Indian food here and nowhere else.  We will NEVER come back to this place and will definitely not recommend it either."}
{"text":"I keep coming back to this indian restaurant! Their food is very very delicious. I keep saying the \"delicious\" after i take a bite! Hahaha the restaurant is very clean, quite and well organize. I love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic , and affordable Indian food. We always get take away and it's always fantastic. The portions are generous and the food is always wonderful. The staff is friendly and the service is prompt. India Garden is my go to for Indian takeout. Super vegetarian friendly!"}
{"text":"Update 11.14.15 Buffet- I'm upgrading my review to five stars. There's really no reason not to give five. And after yesterday's Indian at another place I'm coming to the conclusion this is the best place in Cleveland. I travel a lot and seek out Indian wherever I go. The food was all incredibly fresh and hot. Spice level was just right and the aromatic level I complained about on y initial review was definitely better. Must've been an off day then. Plenty of dishes to choose from, goat, chicken, plenty of vegetarian options as well and possibly a vegan one or two. The goat curry is fabulous...nice and rustic on the bone just how I like it. Tandoori chicken is great also. None of that strange texture you sometimes get when it's been over marinated or warmed up from the previous day. You know what I'm talking about. The tea is great too. I've had tea in places where I literally thought they were trying to Poison diners with listerine in the tea. Seriously. Great service. Great atmosphere. Charming place and NOT in a boring strip mall. Would be a fabulous place to come at night time. I'm sure it's quite pleasing with the lighting and the colorful walls. 109% recommend this place. Clevelanders who really know indian food know to come here.  ***note...I've found all Indian places to be better closer to opening rather than towards the end of the buffet. I got here right about noon on a Sunday.   Old review: Good food, but for me it was lacking in aromatic flavor. Admittedly I only ate the buffet, but that shouldn't affect the aromatic flavor profile. The goat curry was good, the meat very tender, just devoid of much aromatics."}
{"text":"Ok, first--deliberate unfair service to the non-Indian customers by the older man and woman who are apparently running the show. If u are Indian and reading this, by all means, this is the place for you! We had to wait and wait and remind them of what we ordered multiple times. We actually come here 5-6 times a year for the last 4 years, mainly because the actual food is really good. We spend an average of $60-$80 plus tip w/ our kids each time, not a cheap night out. I only gave a 10% tip last night, and I never do that.  The younger guy working there saved this rating because he actually seemed to care about us and went out his way to refill our drinks and ask if we needed anything, and he wasn't even our waiter. I'd say still go here, but not if you're in a rush.  The chicken tikka masala is pretty damn good  and the combo plates are awesome, but they always seem to forget to give you the tea that's supposed to come with it at the end. You have to ask for it."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most disgusting Indian food I've ever seen. I turned right around & stormed back in and got a refund for the gross food I was served. Don't even bother to waste your time."}
{"text":"The customer service is great. If you're on the west side, go here for the lunch buffet, there are a lot of choices. The food is alright. I just think they are afraid to make their food spicier because some people are wimps and can't handle a little heat. Indian food is supposed to be a little on the spicy side! It can still be spicy and flavorful without it being too hot, the food is just plain mild! Not much variety with spice. I get bummed because they used to have butter chicken in the lunch buffet, but now it's always chicken tiki masala. It's okay, but I like the butter chicken more. They used to have these really tasty meatballs in the buffet as well, but the last 2 times I visited, they weren't there. Bring those back!  I also enjoyed the tofu matar curry- mild but very flavorful!   Dinner: I don't recommend dinner here because the prices are ridiculous. Charging extra for rice is lame because rice is not that expensive and most Indian restaurants usually give you rice with your entrée. It's stingy and not very smart for business!  Overall, India Garden isn't bad. The service is great! The people who work there are very nice. The food in the buffet is good, but it definitely seems more mild than other places, so if you prefer your Indian food on the mild side, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Hmmm......I was here for lunch today.  The buffet had a good variety.  However, I came at the end (close to 2:00), so I had the impression that it may have been sitting there for awhile.  Nothing was really spicy.  The \"sneeze guard\" (Is that what they call it?) glass was opaque and kind of dusty.    I did enjoy the naan and the curry.  The Chicken Tikka left a lot to be desired.  Not as flavorful as I had hoped.  I was the only one in there for the most part.  A few ladies did show up later.  The service was great- they were very attentive.    The atmosphere is simple.  Dim lighting.  Maybe a dozen or so tables.  Clean (if you don't count the glass at the buffet).  Friendly.    Was the $10 lunch buffet worth it?  I'm not sure. The best I can do is say that this place is \"ok\"."}
{"text":"ONLINE ORDER WARNING: We were looking forward to trying out this Indian restaurant near our home. We ordered online for pickup, using their website's online ordering check the box form. However, to our surprise, when we arrived to pick up our food, we found out the \"combination dinners\" we had ordered ***from their website selections*** are not actually offered? Needless to say, we were very confused, and went home disappointed and hungry. Restaurant looked nice and smelled good, but we didn't want to wait after already waiting the first time. Hoping the website gets updated soon. A phone call message would have been appreciated before we came to pick up the food."}
{"text":"What a find! Very clean establishment. Attentive staff from the moment we walked in. Awesome selection of indian food, the tandori chicken is awesome! $9.99 for buffet (11am-2pm) with unlimited naan bread! We've taken friends here many times after our initial visit. One of those places I wouldn't hesitate to consider for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm glad this place closed. The food was actually wonderful until.....a COCKROACH came out of my naan basket. And after that, we were still forced to pay for our food even when we brought up the disgusting cockroach. They were rude and unsympathetic."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned because one reviewer said that they found a roach in their food.  I have to say that this place is really cleaned.  Maybe it was just an isolated incident, or maybe the reviewer wanted to hurt business at this place, I'm not really sure.  I have to say though that this was an incredibly clean restaurant.  Even their bathrooms were spotless.    The food here was amazing as well.  I had the lunch buffet, with the palak paneer getting my specific attention.  It was very flavorful, as well as some of the other items on the buffet line.  The service was really good as well.  Extremely attentive and fast."}
{"text":"We ate at India Garden at 5pm on a Tuesday evening. It was nicely decorated and pleasant to look at.   We all had the buffet. We tried everything. I found it to be quite good. There were 3 chicken dishes, 1 lentil, 1 veggie, rice, 2 appetizer type dishes, salad, yogurt, and various sauces. I enjoyed all the dishes, but did miss a lamb dish in the buffet. I would have liked a soup on the buffet also. But we were given freshly baked Naan bread with the buffet and was asked a few times if we wanted more. The buffet also had fresh, very hot Chai tea with milk that was very good. Overall we found it to be a comfortable, enjoyable dinner. We will definitely return. I hope to have a beer and lamb next time!"}
{"text":"I have passed by this place dozens of times but today my wife pointed it out and I checked Yelp for recommendations. We were not disappointed. Service was great and the buffet was everything we expected. The menu looked awesome too- next time I will be more adventurous. The Taj Mahal beer was good. Go!"}
{"text":"At last an accessibly located Indian restaurant in Avondale!  We've been there 2 or 3 times and the restaurant has been empty.  I really hope they make it, and when I drive by each day I'm happy to see the \"open\" sign still in the window.  One piece of advice to the waiters:  when we order alcohol and you ask for my ID, and a younger female at the table asks if you'd like to see hers, say \"yes\" even if you don't think you need to...talk about faux pas!  Food is 4 out of 5, not the best, but not bad.  The combo platters are a LOT of food for the price, and the buffet is passable."}
{"text":"This place is good!! The atmosphere is nice and the staff are always welcoming and nice. Buffet or dine in, good food and great time."}
{"text":"My first time at Indian Garden was on New Year's Eve. They had a great party and several of their popular dishes were out buffet style for the guests to done on. The food was terrific! Some of the best Indian food in the valley! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic and friendly customer service. Delicious food with saag paneer was our favorite. Highly recommend and will be returning!"}
{"text":"India garden has great customer service and a delicious set of options on their menu. Every Indian place is a little different and their Nepalese options add an extra kick of variety to my south Asian palette. I was very touched to spend my birthday at India garden and they really went out of their way to make sure my friends and I had the best dining experience for the celebratory night. India garden is well decorated and has entertaining music videos from MTV India playing on a few TVs. It's a hidden gem for the west valley region and I make a conscious effort to find myself there on a monthly basis!"}
{"text":"This my favorite and go to Indian restaurant. Everything is fresh and super flavorful.  The tomato soup is my favorite dish.  I know it's simple. But it's so damn good! The service is good. The owner is extremely friendly.  Totally recommend this joint. The first time I tried Indian food was here and I always come back to it. I've had Indian elsewhere and the other places just don't come close to here."}
{"text":"This is my 'birthday restaurant'--we drive over from Cleveland Heights just to eat here. They don't charge for rice, unlike some other restaurants in the area. Prices are what you'd usually expect. Great Tikka masala, saag paneer, and garlic naan. They are great with my kid--brought her a free mango lassi the first time we went, which she would not put down. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We used to go there for the half price menu after 9pm! I am from India, and the food is pretty authentic, tasty and reasonably priced. We tried almost everything on their menu. We will not get the Biryani again, just because it was ordinary, not bad. Everything else was good!"}
{"text":"I came here for a lunch buffet after Yelping the nearest Indian place in Fairview park. It brought me to this small, but cozy spot.   I was immediately greeted and opted for the lunch buffet which is $9.99, not bad at all but they don't have many options in my opinion. I tried a few different dishes and I wasn't impressed. It was good, but not amazing, but it also wasn't bad. Just average I'd say. Would have liked to see more popular dishes served here but I think this may have been more of a southern Indian offering.   What makes this place stand apart from the rest is Ron, the gentlemen who served my drink and checked on me so often to ask if everything was okay. He was truly, one of the nicest most kind hearted people I've ever met, some people you meet and you just know they're great. He even took my drink off my check. I think he adds great value to this place.   Decently sized lot and they begin to get busy right around 12:30-- which was when I was leaving. I'd come back if I was in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Best Indian in Cleveland! The spice level is scalable from 1-10 and actually means it, which as a spice hunter I love and my fiancée can still find things to eat! It's great as take out but eating in allows for you to have their naan fresh which makes it even better!"}
{"text":"Had a mostly pleasant experience here this past Friday evening for my brother's birthday dinner. We had a party of 12 and that didn't seem to bother the wait staff. They were very attentive and our drinks were always topped off when needed to be. They were also very helpful and accommodating to the husband who has some diet restrictions - he is vegetarian and cannot eat gluten. He left feeling pleasantly satisfied and was able to choose from more than one dish on the menu.   I started out my meal with the mulligatawny soup. I had never actually tried this soup at any other Indian establishment. I thought it could have tasted better. It was very salty and just not fresh. Obviously reheated. If I'm going to pay over $5.00 for a bowl of soup, I'd prefer it to be fresh.   For my main entree, I had lamb korma and it was pretty delicious. The lamb was very tender and the sauce was good. I'm glad my sister was sitting next to me because I stole her naan to sop up the leftovers.   Out of the 12 of us at the table, I don't think anyone had any complaints. So... not too bad, in my book."}
{"text":"Dinner portions are small maybe equal to 1 cup I ordered the shrimp curry and only had 5 small shrimp cost $14.00. Service is slow and over priced ."}
{"text":"I am here almost every sunday evening for the buffet. Food is good,service is above average! Only thing i would like to see is the variety in buffet. Its always the same things every weekend they should mix it up for the regulars. Thats all...owners are very nice."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant! There is something for everyone....spicy for the adventurous types and flavorful for the rest of us. They have a full bar too, and an assortment of beers from India. Our waiter was awesome...very friendly and kinda funny. Everyone was very attentive yet not to the point of being annoying. They have the buffet for lunch and also for dinner, so if you can't decide on what to get, do the buffet and sample a bunch of things. It was a very good experience and I would recommend this place highly to anyone. Finally something other than a chain! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"We have been to many Indian restaurants in Cleveland and have to say that India Garden is amongst the best here. Of particular mention are the Butter Chicken (tender boneless breast of chicken cooked in a flavorful tomato based cream sauce), the Saag Paneer (indian cheese and spinach) and the Dal Makhani (lentils in cream sauce). We have tried several other items, and have not been disappointed in any. The piece de resistance is of course their Naan/Parantha's (indian bread). Freshly cooked in their oven the Naan is a fabulous accompaniment to the curries. All curry dishes come with basmati rice (Well cooked). They also have a buffet everyday and my husband says that the variety and taste is excellent. The prices for dinner are most reasonable for the quality and quantity of food served. The service has always been attentive and good. Overall a double thumbs up. If craving for a good Indian meal - give India Garden a try."}
{"text":"The buffet was pathetic. Only chicken korma was worth eating all other items were not even close to what they should actually taste."}
{"text":"This is the worst Indian food restaurant that I have ever been to. The food is terrible the selection is minimal. I would not recommend this restaurant to my dog!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. The food is very authentic and amazing. They will adjust the heat to what ever you want, Mild, Medium, Hot, Very Hot, Very Very Hot to your mouth will catch on fire Hot. It's never busy, which isn't good for them but great for us. I really do hope business picks up. The tradition of Indian cuisine is not lost with these guys. Even the next day I'll get a craving for more!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food great service ! The food is authentic and cooked fresh always will go back here"}
{"text":"Amazingly attentive, welcoming service. Can I say heartfelt? The staff made us feel as if we were longtime, cherished old friends.  Our orders were delivered timely and explained well.  The dinner was ala carte and quite expensive, $30 per person, though we know they have a booming daily buffet at $9.99 a person which is said to be quite good, which we shall return for. They also cater and do takeout. We got a menu for later ;)  Music was modern yet tasteful, Indian influenced stuff that accompanied the meal well.   Bathrooms and decor were clean, well cared for. Parking was easy, nice access to Dysart, the place is easy to spot from the road.  The wifey can't handle spice so they dumbed it down for her. My lamb dish was adequately spiced for me though. Drink choices were plentiful. Rice options and side dishes all what you would expect though I didn't notice saffron rice, maybe they don't do it or I just missed it? They have a huge menu. I will venture into more flavorful choices on our next visit.  Portion sizes were good, though maybe a bit skimpy on meat and naan considering price per plate, still had plenty of food left over which they helped us carefully pack, so can not really complain. I imagine they do vegan dishes very well.  Everything presented well, our waters were kept full and we were checked on often to ensure we enjoyed the meal and all was in order.  On the way out, the waiter even rushed half way across the restaurant to hold the door open for us and personally thank us for coming, a nice touch, and their thankfulness quite sincere. That kind of care goes a long way in my book, and sets them apart from many Indian places I've been before.  So there you have it, the India Garden. Give it a go, one of the few if not only restaurant in the West Valley of its kind and caliber."}
{"text":"Decent lunch buffet variety with good quality too. I am somewhat of a Naan snob and they have good Naan! Every time I go it is a friendly environment and the service is nice. My kids like the rice, Naan, and Tandoori chicken! Yum!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food at this place.  Sure it's all North Indian which makes it a bit less broad in menu selections as Tamarind, but they do their food well.  My regulars are palak paneer and biriyani.  I didn't like their korma very much and that is generally a staple for me.  The wait staff is prompt and only one that I know of doesn't speak english.  They love me because I've actually been to India, I can eat with my hand, and I can pronounce things properly.  heh    I had one bad experience with takeout from here which is why I will not give them 5 stars.  I got palak chicken and it made me sick.  I had only a bite or two and I knew it wasn't right.    I love that to date, only gori/goras have reviewed this place.  hahaha  We need a desi review here!  Oh one last thing, for the desi crowd, most likely you will need to ask for a cup of their spice paste to make the food hotter.  Even if you ask for spice level 10 you'll get pretty bland food.  Flavorful but not spicy."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, I wish I had known about this sooner! The food here is delicious and you can't be disappointed. I went here with my boyfriend and his parents.  We ordered several dishes and just shared it among ourselves. From what I remember, we had two dinner servings of biryani, chicken vindaloo, tiki masala, and plenty of naan bread. All dishes had plenty of spices and with all four of us, there were still some more food leftover. The portions were very generous and I could not have asked for anything more.   If you're looking for really good Indian food, come to this local spot. Make sure you also try their Mango Lassi, it's the best!"}
{"text":"Having never tried Indian food and hearing horrible things about another local Indian place (that has since gone out of business) I almost did not want to try Indian Garden. The curry and flat bread are excellent!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I've ever had. The wait staff is always kind, cheerful and warm. Everytime I visit I am always blown away by the outstanding food and customer service. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian food I have ever had. Spice levels are highly customizable, made to order menu items and didn't take much time to prepare. Waiters are really nice and accommodating. We drive 30 miles to eat here. An American colleague suggested this place and not surprising to see a lot of Americans dine at this Indian restaurant !"}
{"text":"This garden of goodness never fails me. We ordered take out on a Sunday afternoon and it was just as delicious as sitting in the restaurant. I have to say that that is probably the best thing about this place to me: the food tastes just as good whether you eat in or take out. A lot of restaurants aren't consistent with their foods and I really appreciate the fact that India Garden is. They always ask how spicy you want your food...\"0-10\" . I always receive my meal accurately prepared, and the staff are friendly and accommodating. A few times they even gave me extra garlic naan (brownie points)!!   While eating in, I find that our food is always brought to us in a timely manner and drinks are refilled graciously. If you really can't decide and are here during the lunch hour, you can't go wrong with the lunch buffet.  Now that I am writing the review, I can't even think of something that I would improve about IG if I could. Maybe it would be a bit of updating the building? However I like the \"old feel\" and think it adds character.  A must-try is the shrimp saag (I can't stray), and the Taj Mahal beer they sell has been requested by my brother in law for years, since he can't find it anywhere in Philly. I honestly carry it out in boxes for him- it's that fabulous. Quality Indian cuisine doesn't get much better than this!"}
{"text":"Just no. Let's start with the service. There are 5 to 6 employees milling about at any given time, yet none of them seem interested in helping anyone. (Aside from the water guy, that dude is on it.) None of the food came out at the same time for our party of 4, when it did it ranged from cold and congealed to lava-like and inedible. The food was mediocre at best. The spice ratings they offer you at the beginning are apparently just friendly conversation, as there was no spice to be found anywhere near the food. The lamb was chewy and I found a family of tiny bones in my chicken. On top of all that, we were overcharged by about 15 dollars. So, no, I don't think we will be back here.   But man, that water guy sure was great. 2 stars for water guy."}
{"text":"I went to the Indian Garden for lunch.  It's located in a dilapidated parking lot with struggling businesses, so plenty of parking!  Anyhow they offer a lunch buffet from 11-3, I believe, daily.  Typically I despise buffets but since I am a novice to Indian food I thought this would be an opportunity to try different things.    First time up, I did just that.  A small scoop of this, some of that.  I really don't know everything that I ate.  There were some signs, but unless you are familiar with the cuisine it might as well be written in Hindi.  There were a few recognizable things, Chicken Curry, Chilly Chicken, and Chicken in Teriyaki sauce.  The rest would be words that made absolutely no sense to me, but I am adventurous so I tried most of what I saw.    All in all, I enjoyed it.  It wasn't something that rocked my core and made me want to rush back, but there was some good flavor in some of the dishes and a nice spice level.  I would say charging $10.00 for a lunch buffet seems steep to me.  I think it should be more in line with the 7-8 dollar range, and lastly I felt the dining area could use a good cleaning.  There were crumbs on the seats and the table cloths were all stained.  Not too appealing."}
{"text":"The buffet is decent although the selection is always the same. I wish they had more desserts. Rice pudding just doesn't do it for me. My fiance loves this restaurant but I could take it or leave it."}
{"text":"I'm no Indian food expert, but this restaurant makes some of the best Indian food I've had in Pittsburgh.  My favorite dish so far is the Chicken Saag Wala; reasonably creamy, and very delicious.  The wait staff is pretty friendly, however not the best service in the world.  Go after 10PM and get half off on a large portion of the menu (too bad no lamb dishes).  Watch out, it closes at 11 on weekdays."}
{"text":"My husband & I ate dinner here last weekend for the first time, and little did we know there was a huge anniversary party being hosted there. We were a bit worried as soon as we walked in, but we were seated immediately & our drink & food order were taken shortly after. We did have to wait a bit for our food to come out (appetizer came out fast), but it wasn't a crazy amount of time. Food was delicious! My husband ordered his dish \"medium spicy\" and he said next time he'll get mild as it was a little too spicy for him. The workers kept apologizing for how busy it was which was nice, but we understood...it happens! They ended up giving us a complimentary dessert before we left."}
{"text":"Great dinner buffet for $8.99. Service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Decent Indian food. Some things run a bit too spicy for the flavor."}
{"text":"Service was OK, the place is huge. We ordered the vegetarian and nonvegetarian thalis . Food was average. Our waiter was accommodating of substitution. Pakistani chef all food tasted about the same there was no distinct flavor in each of the unique dishes and no authentic dishes like Bhindi or other paneer dishes pretty plain food. Good variety though.  The gulag jamun and gajar halwa were decent."}
{"text":"The service here never ceases to amaze me. So polite and genuinely friendly, which to me is pretty rare. Mandheer was an amazing server as was the other gentleman. Our water glasses were never empty. Then there's the food. So good, I had to make sure my mom came with us when she visited from out of state. Needless to say she's a big fan now just like my wife and I."}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine in the area. Naan and rice pudding is are tops. We love the selection at the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Just ate at the India Garden.  The place was uncomfortably cold.  Several people in my party had to wear their winter jackets throughout the meal.  By the time we got food from the buffet and sat down to eat, the food was cold.  I love coming here but have to say I was disappointed.  It was not a good experience."}
{"text":"The food has always been good every time I've been. I love the variety of the buffet. Every time I go, I get to try things I've never had before. I fell in love with some yellow squash vegetarian dish that I never would have ordered on my own but that turned out to be absolutely amazing. The service is always excellent. My only complaint is that the buffet is sometimes not spicy enough for my tastes, I would typically characterize it as \"Mild\" spiciness, I prefer \"Medium\"."}
{"text":"We love coming here. The owner asks about my extended family who she sees once or twice a year. Buffet price went up $1 a little bit ago but is still worth that and more. Comes with fresh naan and chai on the buffet.   Wonderful local place. Please check them out!!!"}
{"text":"The top Indian Restaurant in Cleveland -- probably in Ohio.  This place is amazing!  I give it A+ rating in Service and Food!!!!  I'm a vegetarian so this place is a dream for me!!!  I highly recommend the Veg Pakoras and Samosas.  Also the Dal is incredible!!!!! Now my boyfriend always gets a chicken dish -- all are top notch according to him.  The owners run this place and they are the best -- they go out of their way!  If you love Indian this is the place to go -- don't miss out!!!!!"}
{"text":"I give this place a one star only Bc I can't go lower. Food was cold!! Bland!! We love our food spicy!! When we ordered we asked for a level 9!! I told him, don't be afraid I can handle it! I eat ghost peppers and habaneros like nothing!! So go for it. Food arrived cold!! And wout any flavor!! I explained it wasn't hot enough and if he can bring me some sort of sauce hot enough to put on it. And I'm not sure what he brought us but, it was like siracha!  the chicken was dry! Just def a place I won't go back to!! I've been to many many Indian food places and have friends in that culture so I def know what's right and wrong. Worst $70 spent!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service (every time my water glass was half empty, it got filled), and good value for the price of the buffet. Chicken tikki masala, naan bread, and the spinach bean salad were standouts but everything was good. Plenty of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"India Garden is the most consistently delicious Indian restaurant I've been to in the Cleveland area. Not only is dining in a treat (the owners and staff are so pleasant!) , but their take out is always spot on.  The vegetarian selection is so huge, I bet even the pickiest of eaters could find something mouthwatering. My favorite dish is the Baingan Bhartha with a side of garlic naan. If you're feeling really fresh and jazzy, start with the vegetarian platter and end with the Gulab Jamun.   Seriously, the best."}
{"text":"I love indian food i even make my own. And this place isn't bad it's mediocre. I use to love eating here. I went to lunch with my friend and wasn't impressed. With the food nor the service. We had got the buffet which is normally good. But that day it wasn't. The chicken curry was dry and the place just opened. Our server was a nice woman. Until a guy came over yelling at her in indian about how to hold a glass. I guess she was being trained.  I felt so bad for her. He then took over our table and was rude. I seen her in the bathroom and handed her a five as a tip. Cause i didn't feel the man deserved it."}
{"text":"Never had Indian food. So many different things to try. The pita bread is to die for. I loved the vegetarian entrees as well as the chicken. The buffet is perfect to try a little bit of everything. Very clean! Affordable at 9.99 a person for all you can eat and everything was fresh! 2hrs after and anti-acids have been my families best friend"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Indian although we are not well versed in it this place was delicious! Vegetable Pakora was great"}
{"text":"To echo another reviewer's comments regarding this restaurant.  The place is clean and impeccable. The food is displayed and presented well.  However, the food is dreadfully bland for Indian food. This food has been thoroughly neutered as if the intended audience is in incapable of handling such spicy cuisine.  The rice is dry and is flavorless. What happened to the traditional Basmati rice that is rich in spices and aroma?   The tandoori chicken should have flavors oozing from it due to the saturation of the spices, and the slow cooking process. Not here!  And the options / selection is quite limited compared to several of our often visited Indian Cuisine haunts in the East Valley.  However, if your taste buds lean more towards the less spicier side of this region's cuisine; then, this is definitely a place that will provide you with a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Good memories here. Great Indian food late at night for college kids, and I believe it was half off after a certain time. The entrees can get pretty spicy, so please exercise caution when ordering spiciness level. If you want something filling, try any of the biryanis.  There's a club either downstairs or next door that's thumping at that time, so that might be why everything's half off."}
{"text":"I simply love this place the food is excellent. Tikka Masala is my favorite Indian food in the world. I wish this place would have a little more business so that they don't go out of business! I was so excited when I found this place and it is so completely delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Curry chicken, chili chicken, grilled chicken (that is not ruined by some low class bar--b-que sauce,) great desserts, several awesome rice dishes.They do not skimp out on anything here.  They overcharged me one day when the credit card machine had a problem and I paid cash, they overcharged me by at least $2 for the buffet. One middle aged guy working there/ the owner could be less suspicious but the rest of the people working here seem ok."}
{"text":"What a refreshing find!! Food was legit, well seasoned, flavorful and as spicy as we wanted. Real deal food, authentic cooking styles and owners/staff were fantastic! ! Had curry goat, tandoori chicken, garlic naan...all great. Looking forward to trying more menu items many more times."}
{"text":"Our favorite Indian restaurant and a fantastic lunch buffet! The service is amazing and thoughtful and friendly. Great for dates!"}
{"text":"Ordered the lamb massala which was amazing. The lunch buffet had really delicious options"}
{"text":"Tasty and authentic indian food with traditional Indian decor is hard to find in this area.  We recently came here for a team dinner and were pleasantly surprised with the variety and quality of the food.  The chicken tikka masala is delicious and the vegetarian dishes are just as good.  Of course, the non-stop bollywood videos captivated our attention for hours.  The only reason this restaurant didn't get a higher rating is because of the lack of service.  There were only 3-4 parties in the entire restaurant and yet we waiting for a long time to get our food.  Service was slow and we had to ask several times just to make sure our order was not forgotten.  Nevertheless, I would definitely come back since the food was yummy and priced right."}
{"text":"First time here, real nice bar, nice decor and an awesome buffet, 2 people 22 bucks was a good deal, chicken ,spinach, things I can't  even explain   who cares it was very good ."}
{"text":"We went to this place today with our friends.  I have had Indian food all over the US and without a doubt, this is the best I have had!  We had their buffet - large selection including my fav, Chicken Tikki Masala and everything was excellent.  The service was very attentive and friendly.  It is exactly what we were looking for and I would drive the hour it takes for us to go to this place just for the food alone. Their nan was unlike any other I have tried with seasonings and butter - YUM.  Go hungry and expect now to eat the rest of the day you will be so satisfied."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Cleveland; not claiming to be any authority on this but I've tried various places on the east and west sides and India Garden is our favorite hands down. Weirdly as many times as I've eaten here or gotten takeout I've never eaten the lunch buffet which is supposed to be very good. The owner always greets you when you come in like you're an old friend. We usually order extra sauce to stretch the leftovers a bit."}
{"text":"Came for the lunch buffet - everything is delicious!! Our server was even kind enough to walk us through everything on the buffet since it was our first time here. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Indian restaurant on this side of Cleveland. The Buffet is an amazing time to come in and try many different curries, kormas, dals, chicken, etc. Also very vegetarian friendly place. They always have both meat and vegetarian preparations in the buffet for us to try. It has amazing chicken tandoori, and their Chicken Tikka Masala is the best I've had yet. The servers who take our drinks and order are so friendly and kind. It's a very welcoming place to go to. 5 S T A R S  3/30/2016 update:  I went here again for the standard menu food and not the buffet. I ordered the Chicken Rogan Josh, and my girlfriend ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala...wasn't sure if she liked Chicken Korma because of coconuts. The man taking our order...who may of been the owner I believe...ended up making small sample of the Korma for us to try. That's is really going out of his way to please customers. I haven't see such an individual in the restaurant industry that committed to an act of kindness like that. Goes to show you why customers around here avoid chain restaurants for the smaller independent restaurants. 5 yummy stars!"}
{"text":"I went here once on a date (date's choice, not mine) for dinner during a weeknight.  I believe I ordered one of the chicken dishes, and don't remember much about it, except that it was kind of greasy and flavorless.  What I do remember, however, was the lack of cleanliness in the place, which was noticeable.  The place was dark and dirty, to the point that I'm uncomfortable seeing in an eating establishment.  I also recall service being pretty inattentive, and the owner yelling at an employee.  This experience was enough for me; I won't be returning.  There are better Indian options a few blocks away on N. Craig.  EDIT: As of 7/19, they are permanently closed due to repeated egregious health dept. violations--specifically, due to a recurring roach infestation."}
{"text":"I find it amusing that my very first taste of Indian food was when I was 23 years old, and in Pittsburgh, of all places.  But I couldn't have picked a better place to pop that cherry because the first thing I noticed when I wandered into India Garden for lunch one day was all the accolades posted on the wall.  I've been here for the lunch buffet several times, and while I don't know from authentic when it comes to Indian food, I know that I loved it, and I've been enamored with Indian cuisine ever since."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet & it was just okay. I didn't notice new food being brought out very often, but the restaurant also wasn't very busy at the time. The chicken masala was good but it wasn't very warm, which left me under the impression that either the heat lamps don't work or it had been sitting out for a while. Not bad for a $10 buffet, but it was nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"The best Indian resturant in Ohio! Amazing service and the friendliest staff. The amount of food you get is great, plenty for your next day lunch. The menu pricing is very good for the amount of food you get. The quality of the food is simply amazing.  My favorite resturant in Lakewood...hands down!"}
{"text":"After living in the DC area for a few years with top notch Indian selections, I knew coming to a new city it would be hard to beat. However, I was quite impressed with this restaurant's food and come back pretty regularly.  I first went with my buddy when I moved into town a few months back. The amazing thing about this restaurant is that after a certain time, I think 9 o'clock on weeknights, most of the menu becomes half price making it ridiculously cheap. The garlic naan is spot on and I usually get the palak paneer or the paneer makhani which are both pretty darn solid.  The atmosphere of the place is what is most interesting. While most Indian restaurants I have ever been to are pretty serene and relaxed, this one blares top upbeat dancy Bollywood hits complete with video on multiple flatscreen televisions. This can some times be a bit annoying but it is so strange and fun at the same time. Oh yeah, except one night when a Steelers game was on, the Bollywood party came to a stop. I guess that is Pittsburgh for you.  Anyway, I will definitely continue to be regular here as it is always a satisfying and very cheap Indian dining experience."}
{"text":"Go to spot for comfort food. Very warm and friendly atmosphere. I've been on a paneer kick lately, and they've all been excellent. Make sure you get the garlic naan :)"}
{"text":"Great lunch time buffet! Clean and friendly service. Great food as a vegetarian lots of choices."}
{"text":"I just wanted to shoot over an updated review because I love this place so much! I honestly cannot say enough about the staff and the food at this place. Everyone here is always so helpful, so nice and so friendly. On top of it, their lunch buffet is always hot, has lots of great options and is priced just right at $10.95. DO NOT MISS THIS INDIAN RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum.  I have no idea why this place is getting such mediocre reviews! Maybe its because I'm a girl, or maybe its because Ive been here with Indian friends who chat up the waiters, but Ive always had great service! Just try smiling and being excited to try something delicious and maybe your luck will change!  The food is just amazing. I love the naan (from plain, to garlic to onion to Peshwari), samosas, shahi chicken korma, palak paneer, aloo bhaji, chanaa masala, chicken tikka masala, lamb vindaloo, and kheer...just to name a few :) Oh and of course you need to get a mango lassi. AND everything is even good as take out or as a picnic when watching movies at Flagstaff Hill during the summer.  Half price food after 10pm is also a great reason to come. Especially if you're a student.  They used to play Bollywood music videos on the flat screens, but now they play music different than whats showing on the screens, which is a little sad. We used to impress people with our knowledge of Indian pop music! Now I just have Dhadak Dhadak from Bunty aur Babli stuck in my head 4 years later. And I like it. :)"}
{"text":"One of the better Indian Restaurants in Pittsburgh (among a lot of bad ones). Very solid fresh food, with an outstanding selection of beer on tap (20 choices, including the only cider on tap I have seen outside of Vermont and NYC). The Chicken Makhani (Butter Chicken) and Lamb Seekh Kabob both stand out as excellent, as do the Samosas and Onion Naan. The quality of the chicken can be hit or miss, and they are terrible about keeping the water glasses full (maybe because they are metal and can't see when they are empty). The Sunday Buffet is a great value, and they offer a late-night half-off which attracts a large student crowd. Just be aware that the flat screen TVs that show Indian music videos, can be turns up very loud, but they are usually happy to turn down the volume if you ask."}
{"text":"OMG! My family came in for the Lunch Buffet this afternoon, and even my 6 year old gives this place 5 stars! The food was hot, and everything was delicious! We received a warm greeting when we first walked in, and throughout our meal the employees provided well over \"great\" service; we were WOW-ed. This place is the best!"}
{"text":"The best place in all of Pittsburgh to get Indian food if you're a student living in Oakland on a budget without transportation options."}
{"text":"I was definitely expressed with their buffet! I had been craving Indian food for quite a while, but since it can be a bit expensive having to order all the dishes separately I was determined to find a place with a lunch buffet nearby to give it a try. I was lucky enough to find this place, which I noticed had fairly good reviews on Yelp. This place is definitely nicer and bigger compared to other Indian buffets I'd been to. It has a wide seating area and nicely arranged tables. The buffet had a great selection and I was able to try new dishes that I'd never tried before. Everything was delicious. Tandoori chicken was dry, but then again I've yet to experience it moist and juicy at a buffet. The garlic Naan bread was soft and warm, SO good! Service was excellent! Server was attentive and polite - my glass of water was never empty. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"As far as Indian food goes,  this tucked away place in Lakewood is quite OK.  Now I have had a significant experience with Indian cuisine through extensive travels in the various regions of India.  Those in the know, India Garden serves north Indian cuisine.  Like Cara I too was part of the group visiting this place for the 2nd Yelp CLE International Supper Club.  My sweet Lassi was great - it was frothy, and well blended.  It went down easy until at the bottom I got hit by unmixed sugar, this is a big no no for sweet Lassi preparation  The Samosa were good. They were deep fried to the right semi-crisp factor.  There were not drenched in oil nor the stuffing were overwhelming with spices.  I did however find them a little colder than usual when served.  It made me wonder if they are pre-made and only re-heated upon order.   My entree was Goat (Mutton) Rogan Josh - the sweetness in this dish comes from saffron and nutmeg while the spiciness from the bright red chillies, blended with cumin, coriander, garlic, and ginger.  The curry was thick and had a good balance of heat.  The bone in goat meat was well marinated as it didn't have any gamy after-taste and the meat was very tender and came off the bone very easily.   The pairing of this dish with Aloo (Potato)  Paratha enhanced the combination even more.   The paratha tasted great though the aloo stuffing was sparse.  Although it tasted good as far as paratha goes,  but it could use more potato stuffing given its an Aloo Paratha.  My Masala Tea was OK - it could have been better with more portion of cardamom.  White steamed long rice was served complements of the house.  So was Kheer as a special complements of the house.   Both these items were of standard grade.     The service was spotty at best.  I found it to be inconsistent.  We were being served by 4 different staff members.   I got the feeling that though,  such division of labor resulted in faster service,  but it led to some confusion at times.   For example,  for a table of 8, we were only given two menu until we has to explicitly ask for more.   The staff were very courteous otherwise.  India Garden has much of the basics right,  but its rough around the edges.  The curry and main dish are spot on,  but it has room for improvement when it comes to side dish and accompaniments.   India Garden is definitely a repeat visit spot for me."}
{"text":"I Love this Place! I spend all my money here lol The buffet is worth it. I took my picky eater friend and she liked it!!!  The guys there are really good also. I feel like guest in their house. They go out of their way to make sure I'm comfortable."}
{"text":"I came here like maybe 2 months ago with a friend. I think he got chicken curry. I got The lamb masala I think. They brought an appetizer. I have no idea what it is called. But it seems to be a crunchy bread with 2 different sauces. I've never been taught what the right way is to eat it. But it's pretty tasty. The service was fast. The inside is nice and huge. The food was very tasty. I think i had leftovers. But I can't remember if I ate it all or not. We got a dessert. I can't remember what it's called but it's a Sweet rice soup sort of thing. SO good. I typically get lamb every time but one of these times I need to try something new. I really love the flavors in the lamb masala. This will be one of my go to spots! So if you haven't tried this, you're in for a real Suprise. Indian food has amazing flavors. From what I'm told, similar in taste to cajun food."}
{"text":"Blah blah blah. India Garden has to be one of the most consistently overrated restaurants in all of Pittsburgh.   The decor seems to be a mish-mash of anything 'brown' that they could find, slammed into a restaurant. The service is terrifically bad (and that also goes for Monroeville location). They're sloooow, rude and impatient.  The food is okay, at best and the prices won't gouge you. The chicken tikka masala and the tandoori chicken are decent but not earth-shakingly good. If you're in the Pgh area and can't get to Taste of India or Zaiaka or Udipi, I guess this place will do in a pinch. But do yourself a favor - skip the in-house 'experience', order takeout and eat at home."}
{"text":"being indian myself, the standard is set very high for every indian restaurant I dine at. India Garden has surpassed my expectation. The food is always fresh and delicious! One of my favorites in CLE"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. But the garlic naan was a little disappointing. Chicken biryiami was on point and the chicken tikka masala was ok."}
{"text":"I must admit, I was a bit worried by the sign on the door that said \"Under New Management\" - one thing I loved about the place was the service. Mostly the sign just wanted to warn people that they no longer accept City Deal certificates, which I've never heard of, so we were good there.   On my last visit I had taken my friend Jan for her birthday, and this time she was treating me for mine! Looks like it's a new tradition for us.   I was glad to see the new management was still Indian; I believe that a good chef can create any type of dish, but unless I'm going to a spendy celebrity-status chef place, I do like to see ethnic food prepared by the people who were raised with it (although the Hispanic restauranteur community seems to have the cheap Chinese food formula DOWN PAT here in Phoenix!)  I needn't have worried. Everything was the same. The people complaining about a limited buffet choice have probably been spoiled by those huge mega-buffet places. This has one row of dishes. You get rice, four to six main & side dishes, some tandoori chicken (which is tough and dry, sort of like all the Peking Duck I've ever had), a salad bar, and a couple of dessert.   They don't serve all the dishes they make in the buffet all the time. The choices revolve, so what you get depends on what day you go. I like being able to sample dishes I've never had, and go back for more if I like it. I must, in the future, not mistake the rice pudding for ranch dressing, though!  Although the new manager wasn't concerned that we didn't have enough to eat like the last one, he did keep telling us \"Stay! Relax!\" when we were done. Not because we were buying drinks or anything - I had the tea which comes with free refills, and Jan just had water. So, he wasn't making more money with us being there, but the place isn't really busy during the day, and he didn't need the table. At one point while he was refilling our drinks he said \"Relax - it's a beautiful day today!\" Which it was ... we were inside, though. I think that was two different subjects merged into one sentence, lol.   So, I'm still happy with India Palace, new management and all. And the bathrooms are GORGEOUS!"}
{"text":"The best in West valley. I would suggest going at the buffer time to try all Indian food has to offer. Hard to beat quality/price/ variety! Also don't forget your garlic Naan yummy!"}
{"text":"Originally I had thought i'd never been here, but when I came here the other day with my two friends, I realized I had indeed been here when my sister was in Pittsburgh, 5 years before! It was nice to be back in a supposedly good indian place after I had finally gotten accustomed to spicy food in the past 4 years.  i came around 10PM on a thursday for their 50% off dinner items.  the environment can most certainly be described as distinctive.  it looks part old un-renovated ruby tuesdays, with a projecter projecting bollywood videos with the static theme of a man dancing strangely to impress a woman.  but i digress.  only part of the menu is 50% off, the chicken and vegetable dishes mostly.  so i got my chicken saag, my friends got chicken and vegetable dishes, and each of us ordered one garlic naan.  given their quantity of food provided, i'd say it's a great deal at half off, but definitely pricey at regular price.  the garlic naan was delicious, although a tad thick for my liking. but garlic fixes most things, and it definitely made the naan that much better.  at the end each of our bills came out to around 9.50-10 with tax and tip, so it was definitely one of the best deals i've gotten on indian food (minus indian buffets. i release my primordial tendencies when someone drops me off at an indian buffet restaurant.)  i'll definitely go again for their 50% off deal!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a diamond in the rough. The service was outstanding and the prices are very reasonable. The bathroom needs some attention so I took one star off. The decor was very cultural and welcoming. I love all the options the menu had to offer in addition to a wine list. We had the lamb curry, rice, bread and tandoori chicken. The food was outstanding. The tandoori chicken came out sizzling and it was very tasty. This was my first time trying it and it will not be the last. The lamb curry and basmati rice were seasoned to perfection and I highly recommend this dish. I had some leftovers and it was delicious the following day as well. The garlic naan was outstanding. It was warm and seasoned just right. It compliment both dishes and with ease. The buffet seems to be the best way to sample everything so I'll make sure my next visit is during the all day buffet."}
{"text":"Two stars only for the good service. Food was not freah and tastes awful. Chicken tikka masala smells like raw or uncooked chicken. Chichen biryani was not authentic it looks more like a Mexican rice mixed with chicken pieces..."}
{"text":"Rice was not regional, was overlooked and crunchy. Chicken tikka masala was good, but almost everything else was disappointing. Had to ask 3 times for naan and was only given one (1/4 slice each) for 4 people. Rice pudding was water.  Cheap, but there are other better places."}
{"text":"Authentic great tasting cuisine.  There are very few family owned restaurants in the West Valley much less ethnic options. The India Garden has delicious authentic food, excellent service, and a relaxing inviting atmosphere and is family owned.  Today, was my first time to the India Garden restaurant but it will not be my last.  If you like Indian cuisine this is the restaurant for you. The entrees are delicious, and the sauces are very good.  On this visit we had the Shrimp Curry, Chicken Masala, and Spinach Paneer with Garlic Naan, all entrees were prepared and presented beautifully. However, my favorite was the Spinach Paneer with Garlic Naan, very addictive.  The India Garden Restaurant offer a buffet at lunch which is a great way to try a few different items if you don't normally have Indian cuisine and at just $9.99 it's a great wallet-friendly value. The India Garden restaurant is easy to get to and worth the trip from anywhere in the West Valley."}
{"text":"The only Indian restaurant on the west side. Food is good and the service is good. We like going here. The nan is good. Being a vegetarian, the owners are kind enough to cook to tastse on requests."}
{"text":"Just ordered take out from here. Food was delicious. My husband got the chicken tika masala, I got the lamb saag. We would absolutely recommend this place and will be coming back again."}
{"text":"This is my indian restaurant of choice and my location of choice between Monroeville and Oakland.  The food is yummy!  I am a curry destroying machine!  I'm usually there for the buffets and the food is always fresh and hot.  Getting a refill on a drink other tha water can sometimes be annoying, but all things considered, I'm happy to spend my money here."}
{"text":"This is a great indian place. I love the lunch buffet. In fact, every time I've been here I've only eaten from the buffet so I can't speak for the regular menu. The buffet offers many options. They have different things each day, but always a good variety. The standard indian buffet dishes like chicken curry, goat curry, a chickpea dish, creamy spinach dish, chicken tikka masala, and a cold salad with raita dressing, rice pudding, mint chutney, onion relish, etc.  Always friendly service and a great location on the west end of Lakewood!"}
{"text":"Great deal at late night (half off certain entrees), but it's a little loud at night. The service is generally bad, they don't refill your water, and they don't always even get your order right. The food is also very inconsistent. If you order an entree with a medium spice level, and order the same thing on another day, you definitely will not get the same thing twice.  The lunch buffet is always a good option too, because you're not stuck with one entree. If one of the entrees isn't as good that day, you can just move on to another dish. Also, unlimited naan is a really really good deal!"}
{"text":"Been eating here since they opened, it's consistent and hands down best Indian cuisine in the greater PHX area. Their Gulab Jamun is to die for."}
{"text":"The buffet is wonderful! We go often and will continue. Every time I find a new dish to try. The Indian culture and culinary traditions are some of the deepest and richest on Earth. Well represented here.  6/10/2018: Just got home from a superb buffet. We try to go every Sunday. New dishes are always being presented. The serving staff is welcoming, warm and knowledgeable. The buffet is served Tuesdays and Sundays. Thank you India Garden."}
{"text":"Wonderful Indian food and the owners and servers are so friendly and attentive. I love the chicken saag and the tikka masala is excellent as well. The naan is a must!  Restaurant is sparkling clean as well - if you are in the neighborhood definitely try it!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. I was passing through Phoenix and decided to try this with my friend. I wasn't expecting that much in an Indian restaurant in Phoenix for some reason, but it turned out to be one of my favorite meals. Everything we ordered was top notch and with wonderful flavors. My friend especially liked the naan bread with raisins and ended up ordering some to go. The servers here were also very kind and attentive. I will definitely stop by this place the next time I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"A friendly environment, the food is delicious, the cost of dining is reasonable and great for groups. A nice gathering with family and friends before flying out to the east coast."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I have eaten here, but I remember the naan being really good and the rogan josh was also good.  I want to return to give it a more thorough review."}
{"text":"This place was good but fell short of excellent.  We ordered saag with chickpeas, and it was very good, but it was very heavy on the ghee, giving it an overly buttery taste and a heavy quality.  We also had daal, and it was notably too salty.  We also ordered garlic naan, which was very good, but not the best garlic naan I had had.  The cilantro chutney / sauce brought out at the beginning was some of the best I've had anywhere though--it was diabolically spicy and very fresh tasting.  Service was very good.  To their credit, when you order something spicy here, you get real kick--this place hasn't been Americanized.  My main complaints though hold--too much ghee and too much salt are hard-to-forgive complaints about the food.  In some cities I'd be tempted to give four stars...but this is Cleveland, which has the best and cheapest restaurants of any metro area I've ever visited in the U.S.  And, the prices here are typical for Indian restaurants in America--which again, sets them at 2 or more dollars more per entree than a number of outstanding restaurants across Cleveland.  The bar in town here is set very high, and measured relative to other local restaurants, this is only a 3-star establishment.  Paying more attention to the balance of their dishes, using less salt and ghee, would have easily broken this place into the four star zone--and combining this with slightly lower prices (even shaving off $1 per entry) could perhaps have given them a run at five."}
{"text":"Definitely my Indian restaurant of choice in Lakewood, and probably general Cleveland for that matter. The food is awesome, the atmosphere is great, and the service is superb. All dishes are served on a spiciness factor of 1-10. Be careful to get too adventurous. I have a pretty strong spicy tolerance and I usually stay at between a 4-5. Anything higher will start killing the delicious flavor or have you inhaling water. Also, the garlic naan is a must!"}
{"text":"Very solid Indian food, Tried the Chicken Makhni, the Mulligatawny soup and the Samosas. Chicken Makhni was excellent, well seasoned great balance of sweet and savory, the Mulligatawny had good flavor but was WAY too spicy and the Samosas were also pretty good. All in all a solid meal, Mango Lassi was good as well. Would definitely return again and love that  they allow you to set your level of spiciness on the entrees that is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Maybe I went on an off night, or maybe I shouldn't have gotten the buffet, but it really wasn't that great. The Naan was rock hard, most of the food items weren't fresh; and well, it was just Meh. I'll try it again and order off their vast menu which hopefully will result in a better quality of food."}
{"text":"Excellent... Except one thing. I ordered the goat, and it was really tough, I think it was too fresh, or it hadn't cooked long enough. I almost wish they had said that to me (that I wasn't really ready) because I would have ordered something else."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been craving Indian food, but living in surprise is kind of a downer if you want any ethnic food. We decided to try Indian Garden tonight. It was so good! Better than I expected for the far west side! The food was perfectly and traditionally seasoned and the owner even offered us free sample drinks.   We don't usually get dessert, but feeling adventurous, we tried the rasmalai... It was to die for!   The only thing keeping us from coming back every week is that it is a high end Indian restaurant, so higher priced than the hole in the walls you can find in bustling cities."}
{"text":"When I'm staying on this side of town, I do like making a point to eat here for the lunch buffet.  Sometimes the service seems inattentive. This time I was impressed with the service.  One of the main staff people saw me when he came from a back room to the bar area and waved and asked how I was doing. Then later he made a special trip into the dining room and asked, \"Where have you been?\" because it had been since about March that I had eaten there.  I explained I don't live near and get there when I can. It felt good being recognized, and missed.  The food is generally quite good here. For me it's a good dining experience when they have the selections I like, and an OK one when they don't.  When I went there last Saturday they had a paneer dish which is what makes a buffet worth having, for me (all Indian buffets should have one paneer dish, in my book).  That was quite good, except the cheese was in big pieces and I cut it, to enjoy with the veggie pakoras which were very good.  They also had a mushroom masala - I love korma and masala dishes, except do not like mushrooms, so I would suggest they note how a large number of vegetarians, such as myself, appreciate vegetarian dishes and do not like mushrooms.  The chai on the buffet I'm happy to say is a minimum for Phoenix Indian restaurants. There's is pretty good here. Except it was way too high a temperature, and stayed piping hot the whole time I was there. Maybe it was a fresh pot, set to boil, when it was poured into the dispenser.  I would have liked it about 8-10 degrees cooler.  I liked the watermelon as the fruit on the buffet. I would have liked the mango fruit pudding commonly found on Indian buffets. The \"milk balls\", as I call them, because I forgot the Indian name of the dish, were really good here. The rice pudding was pretty good. (Usually I skip both; here they looked good, and did not disappoint.)  This was a good choice for lunch, and I got lucky by picking a good day with the selections they had."}
{"text":"Best lunch buffet it town! Amazing flavors, always fresh and a clean, relaxing environment. If you've never had Indian this is the place to try, or if you know what you like you can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"Great lunch deal for 10.00 a person. Food is very authentic and it has a rocking bar that I've yet to see anyone use. Which is a shame. Highly recommend 6/5 stars"}
{"text":"Yummy! Authentic and unique. Curry and garlic bread are full of flavor. The milk tea was wonderful with sugar :-). We were so impressed with the food and service. All dessert is yummy, sweet bread balls are good too lol sorry that's not the real name of them. #pray4nepal"}
{"text":"Every time I get India Garden I get pissed at myself for ever eating anything else. This place is FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION ITS SO GOOD."}
{"text":"The food tastes ok but the portions are small and pricey. I would give this place another try."}
{"text":"Chicken Tikka Masala, level 7 spicy--queue love song now.   This was stop #2 along our Yelp CLE International Supper Club group and I really enjoyed it! Did I stare, wide-eyed at the menu for at least 15 minutes not knowing what to order? Well, yes. But, that's more of a personal problem. I didn't want to order the wrong thing, since I'm no Indian food expert, but I'm starting to think that it would have been hard to be disappointed.   Again, I'm a novice when it comes to great Indian fare. All I know is that my friend's mom and aunts whip up the best of the best. Since then I've been searching NEO for a close second and I think this place may be in the running. My meal was delicious, spicy and came with what seemed like unlimited rice. And by spicy, it was hot, but super flavorful and not too overpowering. The garlic naan was a huge hit, meaning I devoured 80% of it, leaving only little for others to try. (Sorry) And the samosas were quite yummy as well, although not as good as my friend's mom's. The chutney, however, was super spicy and fabulous.   The service was a little awkward at times, but mostly just fast and nice. I think the one guy was trying to get Amy T drunk. They even brought out free desserts for us to try, which were sort of like an Indian version of rice puddling. I loved the cinnamon and didn't mind the texture, much. Mostly, I was just appreciative of the extra thought the servers put in.   The atmosphere and decor isn't anything to write home about, but also not so terrible that it turns you off. Nothing a little makeover couldn't fix, but I don't think they mind. Besides, I think it adds to the ambiance.   Overall, I would definitely come back again and it seems like many other Clevelanders agree! The place was almost full and folks continued to come as the night progressed. I'm already kind of craving that chicken masala again. Damn the BF for eating my leftovers. *sadface*"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The proprietor is happy to come out and explain every dish. The menu is not limited, and the bar is stocked with top shelf liquor. And what you can eat here is not restricted to what is on the menu. For example, the owner mentioned several additional types of naan they would serve us. We ordered the naan with raisins."}
{"text":"Went here for a big family lunch and the staff was very accommodating. The lunch buffet was reasonably priced ($10) and there were a variety of options if you eat meat.   They had chicken, goat, and lamb - can't comment on those, but my meat-eating family members seemed to enjoy them enough.  They had dhal and khadi (soup-like side dishes) which were spiced perfectly.  There was plain rice and a saffron-seasoned rice, which I enjoyed more than I usually do.  The pakoras are always a hit (who doesn't like fried potatoes?!).   I was impressed that they kept bringing us fresh warm naan.  A lot of places you have to ask for more or they leave the naan at the buffet table where it sits for a long time.   Overall, great experience and this Indian girl would go back, despite the 20% gratuity charge that was automatically added on. Looking forward to trying their South Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing. The owner grinds his own spices and gets fresh market produce on a regular basis. He was able to modify EVERYTHING on the menu for my dairy free self and was very considerate about it. I'm Indian and have had a lot of Indian food, this was hands down fantastic and I wish he had a place in central phoenix.   GO! GO! GO! you will be so glad you did!   I am planning my next trip back as I type :)"}
{"text":"You need to try to get past the look of the exterior of this restaurant. Don't let it scare you off. It is located in an old strip mall next to some kind of strange Halloween oriented indoor miniature golf establishment.    I went for lunch buffet and loved it. I just recently started eating Indian whenever I can (since a trip to India) so I ate lots of chicken dishes. Tikka Masala, chicken curry, chili chicken, tandoori chicken & naan was all very good.  The Naan was a little crunchy and could have been more fresh, but they did have plain, garlic and cheese naan on the buffet which I don't see often.   The dining room is nice and much more reasonable than the exterior (see interior pics).  I will eat here again when I am in Monroeville in the future. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"@@This review is for dinner time. Two pax@@ Food was very good, the waiter who happens to be the owner was friendly the environment was clean and OK. CONs: it is a bit pricy, everything is ala carte so out meals ended up 20 dollars each. In restaurants defense I didn't check prices thoroughly on the menu."}
{"text":"I've had India Garden many times and been satisfied for the most part. However, today my roommate and i ordered food for carryout. It was $32 total, paid with two twenties and received no change. Unsure of whether or not they assumed it was a tip, but $8 for takeout is outrageous. On top of the tip debacle, they only gave us one dish of rice for two entrees, and mixed up the heat of the two dishes. My chicken curry was insanely hot and my roommates tikka masala had zero heat. I'm extremely disappointed and will probably not be giving India Garden my business anymore."}
{"text":"Highly recommended.. excellent food and the best customer service.. nice and clean .. best Indian restaurant in the west side of Phoenix. Best for small parties.."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in AZ so far. The service is great - the staff is nice - they gave me a free cup of Cha while I was waiting for my food (I took it to go) and it was fantastic. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"I'm rating the buffet as someone who has had Indian food around the world (i.e. I'm not giving a filtered, subjective, strictly Americanized perspective).    Let me start with the pro's:  The price is decent at $9.99/ person for lunch and the variety is decent.  Samosas, Saag, Chicken Tikka, Basmati, Tandoori Chicken, and more along with a little salad bar with some Gulab Jamun.  The Naan was probably the highlight as it was super tasty and came out piping hot.  Now for the con's:  The food is extremely bland.  There wasn't an ounce of spice (as in spiciness) and everything (expect the Naan) tasted pretty much the same.  For those who are looking for un-Americanized Indian-food, you indubitably know that this is a big \"no-no\" as far as Indian food goes.  Aside from the taste, again, the price and quantity still offers a decent deal.  If I went again, I'd probably just stick to the Tandoori, Naan, Samosas, and some Raita on the side."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Food is always fresh and flavorful. The chai is perfectly spiced and the naan is so soft. I could write a novel about how friendly and welcoming the staff is. India Garden is a go- to for Indian food."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a saturday night around 8'sh. The last time I was at this Restaurant was probably 4 or 5 years ago.  The decor has changed a bit since then but the food is still great. We ordered the lamb vindaloo, Goat Masala Curry, Palak Paneer, Biryani and the bread/naan basket  along with extra garlic naan. They were all amazingly good and the naans were soft and fresh out of the oven. We also ordered the appetizer but I would recommend skipping that part and wait for the entree. For the desert, we got some kheer (pretty good) and a Gajar Haluwa which none of us really cared for. The masala chai wasn't that great either.  The service was mediocre at best.  As one of the reviewers pointed out, there are some deals on certain night including the buffet. So, you might want to check that out too.  Overall, Great food!"}
{"text":"I ate here religiously for years until their recent health code issues. It was one of my favorite places! The decoration, atmosphere, videos, music, it was all wonderful! The servers were always friendly and attentive. The food was some of the best Indian I've had. The tandoori dishes were spectacular! They came sizzling on a hot dish with veggies and were full of flavor! I always knew when our food was done because I could hear the tandoori coming from the kitchen. The curries, veggie dishes, appetizers, everything was amazing. There was such a huge selection that I always got to try something new and have NEVER been disappointed. This was THE place I would take friends and family when they visited the city and they always raved about the quality, quantity, atmosphere, and price and couldn't wait to return. A Pakistani friend of mine compared it to his mother's cooking (I wanted to know if what I was enjoying was authentic or not and he confirmed it). The place was introduced to me by a friend who spent a lot of time in India and is now living there permanently. He would not go anywhere else in the city for Indian.  I am hoping to return soon to see if this has changed since the reopening. I really hope not, because it may be difficult to find an Indian restaurant I could possibly love as much as this one."}
{"text":"We got a take out order of chicken curry.  The portion size was good as well as the food.  It was my first time eating Indian food.  If you like spicy it is for you."}
{"text":"New to working in Goodyear, I'm still experimenting with lunch spots. This place had come recommended and Yelp supported it, so I decided to check it out. I'm generally skeptical about buffets and, ordinarily, would try to go earlier to ensure the best odds of fresh food. I wound up hitting India Garden closer to 1PM and everything on the buffet looked fresh and delicious. I sampled it all and there was not a single item I didn't like. The buffet ($9.99) with my drink and a tip, totaled $16.15. While a little on the steep side for what I'd like to pay for lunch, I can say I definitely feel like I got value for my money and I look forward to future visits."}
{"text":"This is one of, if not my favorite spots for Indian food. I've honestly never had anything I didn't enjoy. They have a great lunch buffet seven day a week, which carries a large variety of dishes. Their service puts them over the top for me, such great people work there and they really take care of you during your meal."}
{"text":"It was 8:30 in the evening, we are driving to Phoenix from San Diego and we are worried we are not going to find a place open for dinner.  I consulted Yelp and found that India Garden was in between where we were and my sister's house.  We arrived on NYE's eve and were promptly greeted.  The restaurant is large and only had two or three tables.  A buffet was ready to go but we decided we wanted to order from the menu.  The Lamb Vindaloo (44) was very good as was the Naan bread.  However, two dishes really stood out.  First, the Bhindi Masala (85) Okra cooked with onions, tomatoes and spices.  Wow.  Really fresh and great flavor.  Next, we ordered the Chicken Achari (40) Chicken cooked in \"exotic Indian pickle masala\".  This was the surprise of the evening as the pickle flavor mixed well with the chicken and masala to make a very fresh and pleasant tasting dish.  Finally, the service was spectacular.  At least three different people constantly (but not in a bad way) checked on us to make sure we were happy and had everything we needed.  Reasonable prices for bottles of wine that matched very well with the food makes for an experience that is as good as it gets.  Thank you."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite Indian restaurant. The staff is very friendly. Order the naan basket, their naan is perfect. We were here for lunch the first time, and got the buffet. The second time we went for dinner. Despite being the first ones in the dining room, several tables were served before us. Other than that, I recommend. I concur with an earlier reviewer, too: order the samosas."}
{"text":"Love, love, love India Garden. I am so glad this delicious Indian restaurant is just up the road. I have been here several times for dinner and yesterday I popped by for lunch. I was able to try out their lunch buffet and basically had to roll myself home. So much (too much) incredible food. My eyes certainly betrayed my stomach, but it was WORTH IT.   I especially enjoyed the tomato soup and the saag paneer (my favorite). The buffet food was very mind, actually not really spicy at all. I typically like mine a little spicier, but the flavor was on point. Not to mention, the service is top notch every time I go there. My water glass was never empty, the server checked in frequently, and he kept the hot pillowy naan coming. I highly recommend India Garden for lunch, dinner or take out."}
{"text":"Food is prepared with care and served at the appropriate temperature. That said, the options are few and the flavors fairly bland for Indian food.  On the plus side, we observed them handling beautifully a large group of 12 year olds who came for a birthday, as well as questions from a number of guests who were first-time visitors."}
{"text":"If I'd have read other reviews before going in, I wouldn't have taken the HORRIBLE service so personally. This is, literally, the worst service I've ever experienced. And I once thought I was on a hidden camera show when I was at a Wendy's in Cleveland; the\" worst service ever bar\" was high. The service was so bad it felt hostile.   The food, on the other hand, was quite good. Maybe we'd return for a buffet. We will never go back for a sit down meal. No food is that good."}
{"text":"I've decided to update my review to 5 stars.  The food is so fresh and delicious.  Everything they do is spot on.  What also makes this place special is the manager.  He works so hard and is so pleasant.  He wants all his customers to be happy and satisfied.  He is very generous in adding anything to your meal to make sure you walk away with a positive experience.  This is just a wonderful Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"I kid you not, I came here every other month for a solid year because people...IT'S JUST THAT GOOD.   I don't have much experience with Indian food but enough to know that I like what I like and I LOVED all the dishes ordered here.   Cute little restaurant that can surprisingly get packed on the weekends.   Parking in front or street on the sides, so never had an issue with that.   Prices are appropriate given the large quantity of food and always had left overs!  I highly recommend the vegetable korma and mango lassi. Delicious!!!!   Also, they have a decent wine selection for those vino enthusiasts :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this place several times over the last three years and have never been disappointed with the food or service. They changed their menu a year or so ago, and stopped making a few items I loved, but I am still more than happy whenever I get a chance to come in! Both lunch buffet and plated meals are great!"}
{"text":"Popped in one evening to grab some take-out for dinner. Staff was friendly. Restaurant was empty, but it was early. I went with the...  *Chicken Tikka Masala $13.95 - Very good! And huge portion. I got 2.5 VERY filling meals out of this. Only note is that I got the mild and I still thought it was a little spicy, I am a weak one though.  *Garlic Naan $2.95 - Excellent for scooping up my entrée and delivering tastiness to my mouth! *Mixed Vegetable Platter $9.95 - It was just okay. Order is enough for two people. Slight issue with the samosa but quick response from management resolved things.   All in all I would go back to try some other items, and I have even more options if I check out their Namaste restaurant. One serves Northern Indian food and the other Southern Indian food."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try India Garden for a very long time and finally was able to eat there.  The food is outstanding!  There were three in my group, we all tried different dishes, all were equally amazing.  All of the food is prepared using fresh ingredients.  The tandoori chicken came out and was literally still sizzling, and amazingly fresh.  Also tried was the Baingan Bhartha, eggplant puree, served with white rice, so delicious, even the rice was perfect. We visited on a Saturday so the place was hopping, allow extra time if you are coming on a weekend.  India Garden is worth the wait though, I will be back for sure. Reasonable prices, excellent food."}
{"text":"Yummy Indian food at a great price for the buffet! Don't expect 5-star gourmet Indian food here, obviously, and the buffet is a bit small, but it compensates for its size with taste. To be fair, it's hard to screw up Indian buffet food. If you're nearby or working in the university area and craving Indian food, definitely give the buffet a try. I haven't ordered off the menu and rarely do for standard Indian restaurants, so can't say much outside of the buffet option."}
{"text":"I tend to be very particular about Indian restaurants, as I can normally get really good Indian food from my grandma's kitchen.  So, as this was going to be my first Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh, obviously I was going to be a bit reluctant of giving praise.   Some coworkers and I decided to grab some dinner here a couple of month ago.  First of all, you should know that its going to be difficult to find street parking around this restaurant.  Be prepared to look around, and just drop off some people from your group so that everyone isn't deprived of a drink before dinner.  Once inside, the place was small but not congested with a small bar area towards the front.  They played hit music from India as well Indian music videos across the vast array of flat screens plastered on all the walls.  Nothing fancy, really, just the flat screens made up the decor of this place.  My colleagues had all been here before so they all knew exactly what they wanted, so I decided to go with the a staple at Indian restaurants- butter chicken.  I asked for it spicy just to see if they could actually make it tasty as well as spicy, without just adding extra crushed red pepper.  Also one of my friends loves to burn his tongue and digestive tract, so he asked the waiter to give him a 15 out of 10 on the spice scale.  I threw a blank look at the waiter and he said okay.  The food came out quickly, which was a good first sign.  Next came out the Naan.  At any indian restaurant you can easily tell the quality of the food by the naan.  Overcooked and burnt: you probably should not come back.  Anyways, their Naan was both well cooked and soft which was great.  Finally, the food came out and the aromas were amazing and it was delicious.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dish which was flavorful, saucy, and spicy, and the Naan only helped to bring out the well balanced dish.    Well, this place definitely deserved 4 stars because it delivered the spice level that my friend was looking for, as he was sweating during the dinner."}
{"text":"This place is simply fantastic. Fantastic food, fantastic service, and a very pleasant, somewhat romantic setting. My first time dining here was with my wife and we went with recommended \"first timer\" items such as chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, and a side of garlic naan. We were instant fans of all three. Our server was very friendly, attentive, and just the right amount of talkative.   I decided to return for their buffet shortly after this visit to try even more Indian foods. Keema matter (beef), saag (a spinach dish), tofu matter, and gajar halwa (a carrot pudding) were all excellent, especially the pudding. Even though it was a buffet, the woman working was quick to refill my glass everytime it went below halfway empty.   I left impressed after both visits, and will surely be returning again!"}
{"text":"Service: 3.5 stars (out of 5) Food: 4 stars Price: 5 stars (easily under $10/person) Atmosphere: 3.5 stars (4+ if you don't mind constant Bollywood music videos)  India Garden is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. I really like the huge variety of dishes, which includes many vegetarian dishes. I'm not sure how vegan they are: they taste like they're cooked with ghee (clarified butter). There's this one dish made with spinach and  mustard greens which looks like a dip, and is absolutely delicious. They're pretty good about making it as spicy or as mild as you would like.   Their buffets (lunch buffet during the week and dinner buffet on Sunday) usually have a pretty large selection. When I've gone, there has always been rice, naan, three or four vegetable dishes, pakoras, three or four meat dishes, a salad bar, and some deserts.   The prices are quite reasonable, if you do happen to pay full price. But there are regularly coupons in the City Paper, they offer half-price meals from 4-6pm and from 10pm to midnight, and a student ID will get you a 15% discount. It's not the Ritz, but it's good, hearty, large portions of slightly greasy food at a great price.  A NOTE ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE: Every time I have been to India Garden, there have been at least three VERY LARGE flat-panel TVs playing Bollywood music videos. I have only found one table in the whole place that doesn't leave you facing at least one of these TVs. I never watch TV, so I find the constant brightly colored moving images very distracting. It is a compliment to their food that I keep going despite the fact that the TVs interfere with my dinner conversations. Thankfully, they usually keep the sound off, and just play some more mellow Indian music on the stereo."}
{"text":"Food on the buffet looked really old so we just left... Sunday night at about 8 pm, DL still 2 hrs to go until close"}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday night around 9:30pm. They have 50% off dinner specials between 9-11pm, which is awesome. Just make sure you ask the waitress which items on the menu are half-off. Their servings are big enough for two people (depending on your appetite) and it comes with basmati rice. You can customize the level of spice in your food from 0-10, 5 being mild. I can't handle too much spice in food, but I can handle a level 10 there, and there's a good amount of flavor left in the food before downing a glass of water or mango lassi. So, their dishes are literally only $5 each!!!!!! Which is awesome on anyone's budget, especially on date nights =) Plus, they're open late and not many restaurants are open late with that price and quality authentic Indian food. FYI, for this particular restaurant, any tips contributes only to the owners, not the waiters/waitresses. Oh and the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because it was quite busy that night and our waitress took a pretty long time to get our orders in and it took longer than usual to serve our dinner...don't mess with impatient doctors and nurses when they're hungry."}
{"text":"This place was incredible...in the awful sense of the word. ****Go to Star of India on Craig street for both food and service (an unsolicited plug).  The food I am sure was decent if you got what you ordered, however if the server writes down your order wrong it is up to you to either pay for the mistake or suffer the consequences.  We went for 1/2 priced / happy hour time here and ordered the food, I even pointed to what I wanted on the menu, the waiter brought out a completely wrong dish. I didn't eat anything but the nan and some of the sauce. When we got our bill I had been charged full price, I was then told that what I was brought was not on the 1/2 price menu, and therefore I would have to pay full price. After much arguing I was given the 1/2 price and told to leave the food behind because I did not pay for it. Therefore I am under the assumption that it must have gotten re-used, because why else would they want the food to be left. Absolutely horrible experience."}
{"text":"Great buffet. I love it. Affordable, quick, easy, and lots of options. And by lots I mean everything you could want in a buffet including chai tea. The food is very good, authentic, and fresh. I have never had any issues with food being too cold or left out too long. Staff has always been responsive and polite. I wish they had one by me in Surprise! Someday we'll get these types of restaurants. I hope."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Indian food in the area. I wish I lived a little closer, but still worth the trip to get some amazing Indian food! The chicken tikka masala is delicious and my go to, but you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The staff has always been extremely friendly and welcoming. This is truly a little gem in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"This just might be the best Indian Cuisine in Arizona. The food is just so flavorful and delicious. And the naan (bread) that they serve is sooooooo good. If you decide to do the lunch time buffet, they supply the naan (garlic or plain) for free. And in all honesty if you paid and ate nothing but naan the whole time, you'd probably leave there satisfied. But that's out of the question, because the rest of their food is so good too. But not just the food, the service is top drawer. I'm a firm believer that you don't just pay for the food, you pay for the experience. And the food and experience at India Garden is superlative !"}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is delicious! Service is excellent. The restaurant is clean. Their naan is fairly addictive."}
{"text":"Had their currys in bulk on Saturday for a party and EVERYONE loved it!  Can't wait to go to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pretty much my go to restaurant for Indian food.  I go at lunch time for the lunch buffet, which while a bit expensive at $10.95 still delivers in terms of quality and flavor.  The buffet is compact, but certainly packs plenty of variety.  Also the buffet is available at lunch time every day of the week.  While a small restaurant, India Garden is nicely decorated, with the tables having a nice table cloth covered with glass.  Warm and friendly, the compact dining room is very welcoming.  Even with only eating the vegetarian items on the buffet, I usually have a choice of 5 or 6 hot entrees, plus the rice, a fried item, tomato soup, salad and a bunch of chutneys.  The flavors really pop, as the Garden grinds the spices daily and it makes a real difference.    In addition to everything on the buffet, the waiters bring out fresh naan breads to your table.  You can also check out the chai tea next to the cold items.  As a finish there is usually a lighter rice pudding and some fruit.  If you are looking for some really good Indian food you should check out India Garden."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night meal with Andy P. during our road trip from Dallas to Connecticut.  I couldn't resist the allure of a late night Indian restaurant, and, to my surprise, it was quite good.  The \"chicken tenders\" were weird, dry, and not tasty, but from there things got much better.  The chicken saag was really tasty and the naan was nice and buttery.  Best part of the meal was clearly the dude next to us trying to impress his woman by ordering for her (asking for spiciness of \"less than 0\") and telling a waiter to take away a sweet lassi because it \"tastes horrible\".  Way to get your food pissed in, dude.  Definitely a place worth checking out if you're in the area.  Ambiance: 22/25 stars Food: 20/25 stars Service: 18/25 stars Bathroom: 16/25 stars Probability of going back: 30% (if I'm ever in Pittsburgh)"}
{"text":"Simply sublime Sunday brunch. Healthily and delicious dishes, along with friendly almost family like servers. This is a local gem which is quickly becoming a regular food stop for my family and friends."}
{"text":"They were so wonderful as far as service, the food was phenomenal the mango lassie was so good with the mango curry. It's clean and very welcoming they do have a great feel for just about any occasion..... but really the service was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"the best Indian in cleveland. food is delicious, staff is friendly. and very kind..willing to accommodate dietary restrictions. buffet is fun and delicious! every dish is delicious. cute decor and they have a nice patio. can't say enough good things."}
{"text":"Indian food being my favorite food in the world, i have high standards when it comes to trying new restaurants. I have been to Indian restaurants all over the country, and even many in Europe, so i think it's fair to say i know my indian food! This place is, without question, GREAT! For starters, the atmosphere is wonderful which is such a HUGE breath of fresh air from all the other run-of-the-mill strip mall restaurants that do nothing to enhance their interior. Very tasteful and classy inside, beautiful decor and beautiful bathrooms. Another plus is that Indian music was playing throughout the speakers. Call me crazy, but i think that is wonderful. Many of the ethnic restaurants i have gone to in the west valley love to have large tv's blaring for some reason. It was nice to actually have some soothing calming native music playing while we ate. Waitstaff was fantastic and even offered us complimentary naan which we did not order.   I have been several times now, and this place never disappoints. Twice I have ordered off the menu for dinner, and twice I have eaten the buffet for lunch. This is, in my opinion, the best Indian restaurant in all of Phoenix, and i have been to many.   The food has always been very fresh. I am vegan so i can't speak for any of the meat dishes, but I've had a wide range of the vegetarian offerings and all have surpassed my expectations. This tastes like food I'd get in New York City.  For those that have commented on the language barrier, give me a break! What do you expect when you eat at an ethnic restaurant. Cut the waitstaff some slack. They have always been very generous and accommodating -- very friendly people. Make a little effort to get your order across to them, and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was yummy again. Order chicken tikki masala with garlic naan and basmalti rice. Came perfect to order as I am picky and enjoyed it as usual."}
{"text":"To go order:  Yum yum yum..... Got Chicken Tikka masala - somosas - paneer naan and some donut in sugar water dessert.  IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD! I will defiantly order again and who ever took my order was so nice and was really funny on the phone, cracking jokes and stuff.  Made my first experience even better :)"}
{"text":"Darn, it looks like India Garden has been shut down by the health department before I ever even got to review how nasty it is!   The half off late-night food was brilliant though.  I hope All India follows suit on that lone attribute. Or I sincerely won't mind if they just take the steps necessary to re-open as a safe place to eat. The food was *extremely* greasy and less than fresh, but not as horrible as Taste of India."}
{"text":"It's extremely hard for me to go to the Monroeville area and not go to Udipi, thus it took me nearly 5 years to try India Garden! I went for Sun. evening buffet; and it was pretty fantastic! Lots of vegetarian items on the buffet; all of which that I tried were tasty and extremely worthy of a full second round trip to the buffet. They had naan (plain and garlic) and puri, which were better than their rice, which seemed a little old (some hard and extra chewy grains in there). The food was not very warm. Not spicy either (keep in mind, I am a spice whore), but they have some really interesting homemade hot sauce, unlike any I've ever had before. Their pickle mix is also unique, positively. Dishes didn't seem as greasy as some other places with Northern style cuisine. I ate a ton and did not regret it. I will definitely look forward to returning when I can resist the wonders of Udipi (obviously, if I lived nearer, I'd frequent both)!"}
{"text":"Just to set the stage I come from New York New Jersey. There is amazing Indian food restaurants there. I'm going to try not to compare it to those since this one is in Cleveland. I'll start with the service. The service was great and the waiter was amazing we actually got take out and they were really nice. We ordered our food at a certain time and it was ready on time.  Now let me talk a little bit about the food. We only ordered the baigan bhartha and one garlic naan and one paratha. My garlic naan had way too many huge pieces of garlic on it. It wasn't very appetizing. Also the naan was very undercoat very chewy and very rubbery.   The paratha was okay. According to my father. Not nice and flaky.   Baigan bharata - I don't know where to begin. First of all this did not taste like what the dish should really taste like. It was way too spicy even though we will need ordered medium spice level. It also consisted of some weird egg taste which was not appropriate for the dish.   In conclusion if you are somebody that really enjoys Indian food and has had quality Indian food you will not appreciate this restaurant. They don't have great quality or great taste. However if you are new to Indian food you may just end up liking it out of false pretenses."}
{"text":"India Garden is one of my go-to spots in Oakland, and I think I've been here more than any other Pittsburgh restaurant. Food is pretty much comparable to any other Indian restaurant, but since it's good and convenient for me, I don't go anywhere else for my Indian fix.  There are three things that really set India Garden apart though: 1. Some of the best naan, especially the garlic naan! 2. Half-price late-night deals, but only on vegetarian and chicken dishes. 3. The CRAZY lunch buffet. They have the biggest selection of dishes I've ever seen in an Indian buffet. The times I went, they had 4 or 5 vegetarian dishes, 2 or 3 chicken dishes, a mutton or lamb dish, and several desserts, plus salad and naan. It's seriously HUGE, so go with an empty stomach.  Service is kind of awkward. The servers aren't very friendly and when it's crowded, it gets slow. One time we had an extra long wait and they brought us free mango lassi, which was nice. Also the food changes based on who's in the kitchen...my favorite dish is Lamb Korma, but sometimes it's like, a different combination of spices or something, usually reflected in the color. Very weird how much it can vary, but 9/10 times I enjoy it anyway.  Bottom line, go to India Garden for lunch or late-night and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried the buffet lunch. Selection is good and food is taste. No spicey food but they do offer a hot sauce to add to the food."}
{"text":"I've been to India Garden twice and they were incredibly different experiences.  What remained consistent was the quality of the food.  The first visit was on a Saturday evening.  It was some of the worse service I have ever had.  We had to ask for menus, there were very infrequent visits by the server to check on us and it took almost an hour before our food arrived.  We were going to order dessert, but we worried we would be there another hour if we did.  It then took another 20 or so minutes for the bill.  The only redeeming factor is that the food was very tasty. I  The second trip (because of an expiring certificate) was totally different.  Service was so efficient it was almost too much.  And it didn't even need to be because we ordered the buffet (which is offered for lunch and Tuesday evenings).    The three stars is because of the inconsistent experience.  I wish I knew that the service would always be as good as it was on our second visit, but since there is no guarantee it won't take us two plus hours next time we visit, I think I'll be sticking to other area restaurants instead."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have found India Garden! The Chana Masala is spot on and wonderful ! Best Indian food in the west valley maybe even all of AZ!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, their lunch buffet is something I have indulged in more then most would consider safe or reasonable.  Delicious food, and a great value."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh, though People's and Bombay are good too.  I moved to Pgh from Ann Arbor, Michigan almost three years ago and it surprised me that there weren't more decent Indian restaurants.  But then I found India Garden and I took it back.  It is true that there service can be a little slow (can be, though not always). But they more than make up for it.  And with their 4pm-6pm half off special and their bar (at least in Oakland), it doesn't get any better.    I highly recommend their Navarratan Korma and their Tandoori Chicken.  Amazing."}
{"text":"I went here with my best friend for the lunch buffet. The food was really well seasoned and delicious! The naan was like perfectly cooked, and they had a large selection of vegetarian dishes (great for me since I am one). I think it's a really good deal, definitely stop by if you are in Oakland."}
{"text":"This place is plain awesome. Quite possibly some of the best Indian food I've ever had. It's set in a neighborhood by the university and heard during school it's super packed with a huge wait. But, school wasn't in session and we were seated right away. Portions are small, but you don't need much when you have a piping hot plate of curry awesomeness. The garlic naan ist heavenly and (even though out of a gallon jug) mango drink goes perfectly.  Highly recommended spot if you are in Pitt and craving all of the above. Also, as in any Indian Restaurant it seems - pop music blasting in the background and velvet paintings. Lots to look at and big, comfy wood booths.   Lovely."}
{"text":"Definitely a restaurant Yelpers were right about!    Because it is a popular establishment, I figured I should make a reservation.  I called ahead and was greeted by an energetic man, who ended up being one of our servers during our dinner date with friends.  He was naturally funny and friendly, even if his attentiveness seemed overwhelming at times.  We had a second server in charge of our food, and was patient in answering our questions.  He even came to check on our meal several times to be sure it was perfect.  It was.    They make everything from scratch, which is helpful for anyone with dietary needs. Don't be afraid to ask questions, they are eager to please.  The tandoori meals and curry were spot on!  We even shared a goat entree (so tender!).    We will be back."}
{"text":"The Sunday buffet was delicious. Freshly made naan is brought to the table. The staff is very kind and prompt. The restaurant is nicer and cleaner than what you would expect at a buffet scene. We really enjoyed our meal and the service and will go back regularly. I didn't check the prices before we ate, and I couldn't believe it only cost $30 plus tax for three of us!"}
{"text":"Our fave India restaurant closed in Goodyear, so we decided to try this India Garden.  The restaurant is big and open.  Bollywood music videos were playing on the TVs.  When we got there we were the 2nd table of people in the whole place.  They serve both menu and buffet.  We opted to try the buffet since it looked good.  We headed for the buffet.  The dinner buffet consists of twenty different items.  I got the Basmati Rice, Tandoori chicken, chicken masala, Vegetable Samosa, and Kheer.  Everything was wonderful.  There was a lot more in the buffet, but I over did it.  Oh, also naan (we got the garlic naan) is included with the buffet, they will bring it to your table FRESH!   And hot chai tea.  All that was $10.99 per person."}
{"text":"Very friendly customer service and delicious food. I like their buffet a lot. I love the naan with cheese in it. All in all a very nice place i always like to go back to."}
{"text":"It's not that India Garden is actively bad, but there is not much to recommend it either. The food is your typical Americanized grub, the Indian equivalent of \"Chinese Takeout.\"  The service is pretty unfriendly. The waiter mumbled unintelligibly over the blaring music; then, he looked impatient and put out when I asked him to repeat what he said. No one from the waitstaff looked like he wanted to be there.  The only highlight was that the vegetarian and some of the chicken dishes are \"half off\" after 10pm. My order of chicken saag at $5.50 probably does qualify as a bargain, but the watery saag and the stingy bits of chicken make the regular price kind of a rip off. So after normalizing for the overpriced menu, I consider the discount to be more like 20%.   Conclusion: there are better options unless you are trapped in Oakland past 10pm and starving.  2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Do not judge this book by its cover. It is a gem of a place! Best Indian in Cleveland hands down. Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed! Their garlic naan is amazing, as are a number of their Indian dishes. I'm a a vegetarian so can't really comment on their non vegetarian fare."}
{"text":"Don't let the size or semi-hidden location fool you into thinking this is a junk stop. This is solid Indian food. The paneer is delicious in every dish I've ever had there. The tandoori of any kind is good and does not disappoint.   The staff works hard to please and is quick with service."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great buffet, great naan, just simply great!  Oohhhhh my tummy, i ate too much!  Enjoy, be careful you too may eat too much dang good food!"}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this place no stars. I have ate here about 4 times a year since 2015. Each time the food was worse and worse. I don't eat here anymore. I got serious food poisoning from their food and was sick for a week. I will never set foot in this restaurant again! As for the restaurant itself, it is filthy. Their employees are dirty as well and don't practice proper food safety procedures."}
{"text":"Usually order take out but had some family in from Chicago so we decided to eat in and wow it was even better!  Awesome service.  Decent portion sizes and the food was super tasty!! We ordered the chicken tikki masala, basmati rice raita, vegetable puff appitizer and a califlower patato dish. Every thing was very good!"}
{"text":"The chicken in the buffet is overcooked, old, and dry. Nothing tastes fresh. I was left wondering how long dishes have been sitting in the fridge or freezer!"}
{"text":"There is a reason this restaurant has over 60 reviews. It might not look like the greatest neighborhood but Great food at an affordable price! The place was quite clean and droned a nice ambiance as well!"}
{"text":"The food from this place was freaking nasty . I told them to make the chicken tikka masala  spicy they still made it none spicy even with the mix dry chicken platter. I have tried a lot of diff Indian restaurants in phx area Mesa area n also laveen by far this is the worse restaurant ever when it comes to the taste of food . If ur an Indian family n looking for a good place to eat please don't come here it's waste of money and time"}
{"text":"Had a $10 plate from here at the taste of Lakewood.  It was so terrible. Not hot, dry and no flavor at all. I'll never go here. Not a way to advertise when you send out the worst food at a food festival."}
{"text":"Chicken and Paneer Tiki Masala medium or spicy are fantastic here. Very flavorful. Would probably be a good dish to choose if you are unsure of the menu."}
{"text":"I'll start out and say the food was okay. The good Yelp reviews got me to come try this place. I love me some great Indian cuisine. But the flavors did not live up to what I'm used to in Texas. What should have had a nice spicy kick, just was average. The tandoori chicken was good. The tikka masala (butter chicken) wasn't as \"buttery\" as I'm used to. When I was looking forward to the spicy, it just wasn't there. Nonetheless, still rather flavorful and still satisfied with having tried it."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Since moving to Cleveland, every time I've tried an Indian place I've been incredibly disappointed. This place however delivers! It's a cozy space, perfect for a date I felt ;). If you sign up for their newsletter, you get $5 off an appetizer. We got the sampler for 2, which was a pretty big portion and cheap with the discount. I tried for the first time a non-mango lassi (got the sweet lassi that has rose water). It was DIVINE. I would love to come here for a lunch buffet, pig out, and let my stomach bloat up to the point of pain. Be careful with the condiments though. One of them was really spicy, I think maybe the green one, which I have never encountered it being spicy before at other places.  Note: It's a bit oddly located, far from the street and its sign. I ended up walking into an Italian restaurant that was next to it and closer to the street. It's located in a box-shaped house."}
{"text":"The beau and I stopped by on a whim whilest exploring our new city and it's probably the best find so far.   Walking in for a late dinner we were happily greeted and easily seated. Service was prompt and pleasant. We ordered some garlic naan, chicken tikka masala and chicken vidaloo. All came out within 10 minutes and boy was it amazing! The tikka masala was creamy and fresh. My beau ordered his vidaloo spicy, and it was the perfect amount of spicy.  We've been back at least 8x since and always end up happily full. (ITIS!)  I can't wait to try the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"What can I say positively that hasn't already been said?  This is a very good restaurant and I plan to go back time and time again for their buffet.  Overall very tasty, good and fresh food.  It was quite crowded, which I like at a buffet, because they keep the food coming fresh.  The server always had nan on our table, and as a vegetarian there was more than enough for me to eat and leave completely full.  Not sure how authentic it is, but still very flavorful nevertheless.  What keeps it from getting 5 stars is the logistics of the buffet to the kitchen.  It's horribly clustered with servers coming and going, refilling buffet items, while people are lined up to the kitchen area.  I felt I should get as much food on my plate as possible so I wouldn't have to go back up there.    But good food trumps bad logistics in my book any day.  YUM!"}
{"text":"A great lunch buffet, every day until 3pm. On weekends too, not just m-f like some lunch buffets do. Always with several good meat dishes, tandoori, and a good vegiterian selection. Staff is always good with refills on the water and the price is great. I've only ever been in for dinner once, because the lunch buffet is so great."}
{"text":"I've been going to India Garden for ten years or so. I was first introduced as an undergraduate at Pitt and I've been returning ever since. India Garden has an excellent half price menu, with half price items from 5-6 and from 9-11. The food is not only cheap, but very high quality. I went with a friend who grew up in South East Asia and has traveled extensively in India and he vouched for the authenticity of the food. The garlic naan is the best I've ever had, and the Chicken Tikka Masala and Curry Chicken are excellent (and available on the half price menu). The mango lassis are very tasty, as well. The lunch buffet is great, with good variety and high quality dishes.  The atmosphere is also fun, with Indian music and Bollywood films and music videos playing."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet.  I had only had Indian food once before, so I'm probably not the best person to give a review.  I was on the fence, deciding if I liked Indian food or not before eating here, and this place did not sway me to the \"I like it\" side.  Maybe curry's not my thing.   I won't avoid the place if my friends want to go, but I won't ever pick it out as a place I would want to go."}
{"text":"I will avoid the lunch buffet and hope for better results. Pretty tasteless, bland with no spice. Was really looking forward to this"}
{"text":"This is my 1st time coming here. The food was good and flavorful. Also very spicy like I like it. This atmosphere was good but the people there weren't very attentive."}
{"text":"Below average food and service for the lunch buffet we tried.  I was hoping it would be good so i could enjoy some indian food closer to home but it wasn't good unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is by far my most favorite Indian place in the city. Great happy hour prices for 50% off chicken and veggie dishes around 4p-6p (or is it 3p-5p? Anyway, the owners are great and make you feel welcomed. They will remember you by name. Food is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Food Is wonderful!!! However, it is tough to eat there will food allergies. They say they will accommodate but you can't eat half the stuff on the menu or the buffet. If you have a nut allergy, get the curry chicken, it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular, would bring friends, clients, and out of town guests on an almost weekly basis. Over the last few months the service went from mediocre at best to outright terrible. They say they are open until 11pm but now no longer accept customers past 10pm. After the extremely poor and unprofessional service from my last visit I will be finding a new regular spot for Indian food - for which I am extremely disappointed as the food and atmosphere here are top notch, but because of the service I will never return."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff. We loved the menu options and the service was very prompt! We didn't wait long and enjoyed the atmosphere. Very well done."}
{"text":"The best Indian lunch buffet around!  I stop here every time I'm in Monroeville at lunch time."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant but not everything is good  Me and my wife ordered chicken biriyani and vegetable biriyani. The veg biriyani is just like sweet rice. They don't know how to make biriyani. So don't order biriyani. Besides that the restaurant is clean, well maintained and cozy."}
{"text":"I see Indian Garden every time I make a visit to Sprouts grocery store, and never knew what kind of flavors and ambiance I've been missing all these years...until Saturday night. First, we sampled their vegetable korma at the Flavors of the West festival - and went back about 5 times for more. After that it took us less than a week to visit and fall in love with the actual restaurant. We spent a couple hours during Saturday night's downpour there with the managers and wait staff as our company. They started us off with the garbanzo bean chips and delicious accompanying dips. We had garlic naan, madras vegetables, daal maharani, and vegetable rice as the entree. Flavor was bursting with every bite. The Indian beer and chai tea were very complimentary to our indulgence. We were too full to partake in dessert, but after asking about the gajar halwa for next time - they surprised us with a sample of the carrot delight. Must order next time as well! To add to the experience, this was by far the BEST customer service I've received in a very long time. The food and the special treatment will cause you to spread the word like wildfire and come back for more at every chance."}
{"text":"La atención era buena pero la comida era mala, lo único bueno era el nan y el arroz. Tienen muchos platillos en el buffet pero lo único bueno eran unas albóndigas en salsa picante, probé todos y ninguno era bueno. Los postres en especial el arroz con leche estaba bien."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food I've had in Pittsburgh (and a few other cities...)  Cheap, delicious, great service - what else is there to say?    Also, used them for catering a decently large event (100+ people) and it was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The food was delicious, BUT the service impeccable!!!! Wow  EJ is so helpful, he helped us pick from the menu.  My wife had the chicken tikki masala and I had lamb birayani.   Mona is also amazing"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for the buffet after I had tried an amazing Indian buffet on a business trip. In short, I was disappointed.   What looked, from a distance, like a reasonably-sized buffet, was a surprisingly small spread for a Sunday lunch. Half of the buffet was dedicated to vaguely salad-like items and sauces. The other half - the entrée half - had very little selection, made worse by the rice cooker sitting nearly empty and one of the trays completely empty for more that half of our visit. (I asked several times when it would be restocked, each time being assured it was being refilled very soon. False.)   The woman in the dining room was extremely nice and eager to please. The two men in the dining room walked around, occasionally stirring trays from the buffet. (I was most turned off by the man who, when asked what soda they had - Pepsi or Coke - responded, \"well which do you want?\" When I requested Coke, he said \"ok that's what we have\". Hmmmm.... )  I was turned off by the lack of buffet selection and the disingenuous service (by some). IF I come back, I'll order off the menu and adjust my expectations for service."}
{"text":"First time here and I love it. Food is delicious I had the tikki masala and it was amazing!!!! This place is a must, I'm so mad at myself for not coming sooner!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food and drinks were delicious. We try to stop by here any time we're on this side of town. My wife is obsessed with their Chicken Korma with Rice and Garlic Naan."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh's best Indian food, except for the authentic place in Monroeville. India Garden's bread is exceptional. I have a friend from India who disparages most of the Indian food in Pittsburgh, including India Garden, and I asked him \"but what about the bread?\" He blinked, and had to admit that India Garden's bread was as good as any in India.  People complain about the service. Yes, the service kind of sucks. Twice in my India Garden eating career they have lost my order and I ended up sitting and waiting for an extraordinary time. They did end up giving the table free appetizers and a round of drinks.  It may be tricky to get your water refilled, but they always bring out the food as soon as it is done, so the food is always hot and the bread is incredibly fresh.  Chicken and vegetarian dishes (and the first two biryanis) are half off between 4-6PM and 10-12PM. They used to be open until 1AM, now they are open until midnight with the last (grudging) seating at 11:30. They also used to have a $1 draft every night, now the perpetual special is $2 Yuengling drafts. They have a respectable enough beer selection beyond that and a full bar.  My favorite dishes:  Shahi Chicken Korma, Paneer Chili, and Shahi Malai Kofta"}
{"text":"THE best indian food around cleveland area. This place does not compare to all the other indian restaurants I've been to. I highly recommend this place to eat if you come to cleveland and want authentic food. I've never came across a restaurant with the best flavor in their dishes. Our waiter/waitress are one of the most friendly and do an excellent job at what they do. Very professional and always make sure our water is filled. I LOVE LOVE LOVE mango lassi.   The price is par and we make sure to leave a very good tip for them because we personally know how hard it is to be on your feet and constantly move around trying to please all the customers.    I come here with my boyfriend about once a week when we crave their food and they haven't disappointed us. If you have a chance to be in the cleveland area, go check it out!!! I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Always a great experience at India Garden! The service is exceptional, the food is phenomenal and the ambiance is superb! There are too many dishes that are my favorites! I only wish the portions were larger!"}
{"text":"One of the worst indian restaurant i have visited so far. I ordered chicken biryani, mutton biryani, veg fried rice and kabab platter which totally ruined our hunger. Not even one dish was good to taste. Veg fried was worst and pathetic. Even after complaining, the owner didn't do anything to be better. Worst service. I don't recommend anyone to this place.  Don't go and spoil your pleasant time."}
{"text":"Great food !!! Went there for lunch with the family. Very outstanding service!! My 1 year old made some mess but they understood!!  Well return again!!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food and awesome service. A bottle of wine is very inexpensive and delicious.  I had the Goat Rogan Josh, which was amazing. Just watch out for the bones. The cilantro chutney is the best condiment. I left happy and had left overs for lunch."}
{"text":"My entire family loves this place. The lunch buffet is only $9.99. We loved everything , but especially the garlic naan bread, chicken tiki masala and tandoori chicken. They also have a carrot desert and rice pudding desert that are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Discovered this place when we were out shopping and looking forward to going back! It's small which I've actually come to enjoy in a restaurant. The decor was inviting and intimate and I was happy to see a small patio off the side. The view is limited to the parking lot and the back of adjacent buildings but still, I love patios so I'm looking forward to visiting during warmer weather.  The service was average on speed but excellent on charisma. Being relatively new to Indian, I had a few questions about dishes I had yet to try and they were very accommodating and suggested I come back for the lunch buffet which I fully intend to do. It's offered seven days a week and at under $10, I can't think of a better way to explore some different dishes.  I don't know if this place is the best of the best but I think it was good food at a great price in a charming atmosphere."}
{"text":"So here's an update. Had the lunch today and ordered off the menu. Seem like the weekend buffet has a little better selection than the weekday spread. I ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh and specifically asked for hot. Yesh, I like it HOT. Not your usual american taste buds here so I told him to make it like I'm Indian.  They did. They did and it kicked. Whew, my sinus is now cleared and my astigmatism is gone. Overall, the Lamb Rogan Josh taste, just as good. I just wish for 15 buckaroo, they'll provide more than just basmati rice to compliment the main dish.  So I also ordered the Peshawari naan. If you like naan, you've got to give it a try. It's your regular naan with dried fruit and nuts encased. Goes well with my Lamb Rogan Josh."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The Chicken Korma is my personal favorite with a side of Naan."}
{"text":"Solid buffet for lunch. Clean place and attentive service. I will probably stop in a again soon, if in the area. I could have done with a better selection, but I probably just wanted some goat. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"Thank god for newer reviews... I should have listened to them!!!  Been here a few times before back in like 2003-2004 time frame. Remember the food and experience to be much better back then. Was in town visiting and wanted to return to this place again. Yes it was the same old place but the food was pretty crappy.   Service it HORRIBLE and these people working there lack major personality. There was constant confusion as to if we ordered or not, what we ordered, and so forth. The server was actually a bit rude I thought constantly rushing us and reaching across me constantly to take silverware and plates from other side of the table, and at 2 minute intervals???  Will not return. Seriously if you are pissed to do this type of work then get a new job. If you run a restaurant you better be a little personable."}
{"text":"Really good! They definitely make it hot though, so be careful with your ordering. I normally like spice and as a typical looking American I usually order things a little hotter than I really want at Indian restaurants as I think they have a tendency to tone it down to Americanize it. Glad I tempered myself and only ordered the 5 out of 10 though, it was as much as I wanted to handle, my friend got an 8 and loved the flavor but she couldn't finish.   I had the lamb vindaloo, really good flavors, and tender lamb and soft fluffy potatoes! The knaan was also delicious. There were some slight snafoos with the service but they were friendly and apologetic and made out right, so great overall. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Garlic Naan!!! So GOOD!!!! Loved the food... I was actually expecting a dinner buffet...don't know where I got that idea but the buffet is only during lunch time apparently. Anyway, I stayed and dined in for dinner...I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere but the food and service trumped it. Definitely recommend India Garden and I want to try the lunch buffet soon."}
{"text":"Literally my husband and i's favorite restaurant in town. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. I think we may be addicted kitties"}
{"text":"Always my go-to place for near west side India. The Sharma's run an excellent and intimate little restaurant with an almost bistro feel to it. The service is consistently top notch with a friendly and knowledgeable staff who put the diners best experience with their food first.   I went in for a take out order recently and just the greeting upon arrival was enough to make me smile. The food was packaged and ready and when I made an additional request  for an Indian Coffee, I was surprises with a deliciously quick accommodation. Speaking of delicious, I had also requested \"Indian Spicy\" for my level of spice and I have to say I was not disappointed.   I would highly recommend IG for a date night if you are looking to dine in. Perfect little spot and the Sharma's make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"The service here is great. They are very welcoming and accommodating.  This was our forth visit to the restaurant but two other times we had the buffet.  This trip we arrived late after a movie just prior to closing and they were more than willing to serve us.  They told us to take our time after we ordered they began to close up but they expected us to take our time and not feel rushed. They explained they would be staying late to work on the following days prep.  It was great to have the place to ourselves and have an attentive staff.  The food is great. On this visit I had the Chicken Vindaloo. The husbear had the Chicken Tikka Masala. Both were with rice and garlic naan.  This family place will be sure to satisfy your Indian cuisine needs. The restaurant is clean, modern and well maintained."}
{"text":"I must say their real menu is different from menu on Yelp. It's more of a South Indian Restaurant. They have limited options for Main Course specially if you are vegetarian. They had about 6-7 options for vegetarians including daal.  We were a gang of 4, so we had to think what to order looking at the menu. But, the food quality was pretty good. We all liked the food. I liked the Garlic naan.  Their staff is very responsive as well."}
{"text":"I used to come here back when i went to PITT many years ago and loved it then ...remembered the place today and thought to revisit ...had the kabab platter, karahi lamb with rice and some chicken naan ...and loved them all ...will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I love Indian food - North or South, no matter. India Garden is probably my favorite Cleveland area Indian restaurant - excellent food, reasonably priced, and really friendly, helpful staff. Several of the waiters seem to remember customers (is that a sign that I go there too much?) - on a recent visit, I even overheard the manager talking and joking with regular customers, and even remembered that they are vegan without prompting.   For lunch they do a small, but well done buffet. I'm not typically a buffet person, but I've had it on a number of occasions and would happily go for it again. The menu is large, but if you aren't sure what to order and you're with more than one other person, I suggest ordering a few things and sharing. this does involve convincing people to go to get food, which is difficult, but the sacrifices I make to eat food. Such is life. Anyway, I love Saag, and India Garden makes my favorite. It has the perfect consistency.  My only complaint (and this is pretty mild) is that if you want your food *REALLY* spicy, you may have to send it back. I went to dinner with a friend a few months back, and maybe because he was a new face or they have had too many burnt tongues, they were a little too skimpy with the spices. He sent it back twice, and they were really nice about it both times until he was like \"Listen, I want it the hottest you can make it. If you think it's too hot, bring it.\" and they did."}
{"text":"We were there last night with our family ... A very average food that is little over rated ... Ambience is good ... Nothing to say much .."}
{"text":"First time eating Indian food but what I ate here I thought it was very tasty.  My boyfriend has had Indian food and he loved it.  We had there lunch buffet 9.99 and they bring you this naan bread that was great. We will be returning the service was great and it was a very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Straight up good. Good food, good atmosphere, a little fancy looking and did I say good food? The waiter was very soft voice and would be a problem if the place was packed but that wasn't the case so it didn't matter.  I do recommend eating here"}
{"text":"This is average Indian restaurant,their buffet lunch is good somehow and diverse, usually they serve 4 non vegetarian and 4 vegetarian entrees on their buffet , and it's less than 12 $ per person."}
{"text":"The Indian food here at India Garden, from what I've  had, is A M A Z I N G. I had the Tikka Masala and an array of other foods from their lunch buffet which was 10.99$. I was very stuffed and satisfied upon leaving this restaurant! It is reasonable and delicious! A rare find in Arizona, especially on the west side of the greater Phoenix area. I would definitely come again. I gave it 4 stars only because I may not be knowledgable about \"authentic\" Indian food. However, from my experience the food was absolutely delicious. The restaurant had all of the qualities people look for: atmosphere, service, quality (especially seasoning), and cleanliness!"}
{"text":"i feel that indian food is pretty standard, so when you can not live up to the expectations of 'average' you must be doing something wrong.  came here for the sunday lunch buffet and it sadly was not up to snuff.  the chicken quality (both tandoori and makhani) wasn't fresh, nor was the curry tasty.  the same can be said for the mixed vegetables.  the chickpeas were good but that was really it.  even the sweet lassi was too watery (way too much ice).  overall atmosphere and location is nice; sizable space and clean, friendly staff.  but it you are looking for good food, just drive by and don't slow down."}
{"text":"I don't usually give places that are afforable and decent low marks, but recently i visited during half price and they kicked us out of the restaurant at 10:55 (they close at 11), when we weren't finished eating.  They also are generally just really terrible at retrieving things that we request such as water etc.  The food is fine, nothing extra special, service is terrible, prices are good."}
{"text":"Maybe this is just my perception, but when you go to restaurants nowadays, the staff aren't as friendly as in the past? And I'm not talking about that fake friendly, either.  My trip to India Garden was like a time travel experience: everyone was friendly and attentive. Of course, no matter how amazing the staff is, subpar food will undermine the experience, but the food was amazing; the samosas, especially.  Everyone should copy this restaurant's style. 5/5 all day."}
{"text":"This my favorite Indian restaurant. Excellent food, service, and the owners are wonderful. Never a bad experience. Definitely recommend. Try the Chicken Tikka Masala with the garlic naan."}
{"text":"I love this place just ordered the chicken curry,rice and garlic naan. So good! My girl gets the chicken briyani she loves that too!! To-go or eat in it a great place."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. We tried it for the first time today, and it was an immediate favorite. The buffet has great selection during lunch time, super clean, fine taste on the decoration, and very friendly servers. It was quiet and the food was tasty. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just amazing!  In the mood for some flavor and spice??? Go here!  Great staff and decor!"}
{"text":"Indian food buffet - small selection of food.  Wished there were a larger selection.  The food choices were hot (temperature hot) which is how the food should be served.   Buffet Line - crammed in a corner for everyone to use.  We noticed that some items were in the corner with the bread server pushed up against it. It was tough to navigate.   Dining Room - could use a few less tables to give more room so one can pass by tables without turning sideways.   Dining Room decor - needs an update!  The drapes were heavy and discolored (faded from the sun, since the sunlight blares through the dining room). I think it was more maroon in color -- really dark and would be great in brighter cleaner colors.   Windows and window sill could use some cleaning. Our table was pushed up against the window and we were crammed into a tight spot.  I think my seat bench had busted springs because the table top was almost to the bottom of my chin.   This place has a banquet room going through a separate door.   Prices  - inexpensive."}
{"text":"First time I've ever had this kind of food. I was pleasantly surprised and they make your food at the heat you want."}
{"text":"India Garden provides solid entrees for a dessert and a reasonably tasty and reasonably priced buffet at lunch.  I've always had an enjoyable experience here, and after trying a wide variety of dishes, I've found nothing negative to say about the food.  It's solid, through and through, even if it doesn't always stand out against other options in the area.  One downside is that the service can be very slow, whether you're waiting for a water refill or a check to come."}
{"text":"I've been to the India Garden about five times.  The service is great.  The Saag Paneer is delicous and I've been told they make the cheese onsite.  The garlic naan, beef korma, and pretty much all of the chicken dishes are good.  Drinks are reasonable priced.  We've enjoyed  our meal every time we've eaten here."}
{"text":"Just went here with a friend for their dinner buffet (Sundays and Tuesdays end at 9pm)  The food selection wasn't bad, pretty extensive actually (I recommend going). it wasn't expensive either, around 10 dollars. The only hangup was the food was a bit salty and there a surprising amount of meat dishes. So I guess if you like meat - then there are no complaints!   Other than their buffet, I've been here for their half off quite a bit and say that the portions are pretty big and the prices aren't bad after their half off. Great for a poor college student like myself."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for months and want them to have more business because I want to keep eating there!  This place is a great choice for a dinner outing in Avondale.  My families favorites are the Chicken Madras, Chicken Tika Masala and the Garlic Naan. They will adjust for spiciness on request and the hot is not extremely hot for those versed in spicy foods, I consider it just right.  The staff are always friendly and attentive and the interior is decorative and always has Indian music/television on to add to the environment.  If you want a way to checkout all of their food, try the buffet to get a feel for it. It's everyday from 11 to 2, but don't expect everything, just the most popular items."}
{"text":"Good Indian restaurant in Lakewood, almost in Rocky River. Hidden a little off the road, it's bigger than it looks from outside. Buffet at lunchtimes. Good food at a good price."}
{"text":"Love this place! Perfect cuisine for vegetarians and vegans The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. This will definitely be a regular spot for us!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat! The service is phenomenal, the food is even better. Our favorites are the chicken mahkni, tikki massala and naan. DELISH! Love love love this place -- I only wish they'd open one in Avon :)"}
{"text":"Pathetic service, so rude waiters, takes so much time for food, chicken mugalai was not good either after the wait, no clue why good reviews for this restaurant"}
{"text":"YUM! We were introduced to this place by native Pittsburghers, who took us there for the all-you-can-eat buffet on a Sunday. And if you're like me, you can eat alot when it's good. And this is good. HUGE veggie selection, and tandoori that isn't oddly pink. More condiments than usual, buttery naan, and decent price make it better than most."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place four stars because the food is really good. If I hadn't read previous reviews on this place I would have never gone there. The outside looks run down, however it is certainly worth a try! I got the lamb curry and I will be getting it again. The people there are also very nice. Classic example of don't judge a book by its cover!"}
{"text":"First off the food was amazing i had the lamb boti masala it was so good i couldn't stop eating the customer service was good too"}
{"text":"Tast good. Enployees very friendly!! I missed the lunch buffet so i will definitely coming back for lunch!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for business and was craving some Indian cuisine, Chicken Biryani to be more specific. This place was closest to Westgate, ended up being an obvious choice. Unlike most places the entrees here don't come with rice, you have to order rice separately. I ordered the Chicken Biryani and truth be told, it was a 5 out 10 as you dug in, it could have been a 6 but definitely not more. We got a Chicken Madras as well, with naan and rice (extra). It was really good, definitely a 8.5 on 10. Tender chicken, good flavored curry and a amazing garlic naan did it for me. The raita (yogurt with mint n onions) was a little to sour for my liking . I'd rate it higher but the Chicken Biryani wasn't what I expected it to be. If you really want Indian cuisine and you're in Avondale, give it a shot."}
{"text":"I went their for lunch on a weekday and had the lunch buffet.  It was a typical lunch buffet, nothing special.  Vegetarians will find it convenient that they separate the meat and vegetarian sections and the vegetarian options outnumber the meat ones.  As a meat eater I would have liked a few more meat options.  Food was good but not anything special.  Service was typical for a buffet lunch where minimal service is needed.  It is a nice atmosphere that is nicely decorated, but the tables are placed rather cluttered and close together."}
{"text":"My mom and I have been coming here for the Sunday lunch buffet for the last 10 years. The food is always consistent and I've never had a bad experience. I'm not sure why people are saying there's a small selection, there's always at least three appetizers, ten entrees, two types of naan, a salad bar, and at least four desserts. The only entree that is remotely sweet is the korma. Yes, the decor is dated, but my primary concern is the food. The service is very good too, they're not the most talkative staff but they're good about filling your water and taking your dirty plates away."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but it was an awesome experience. I'd definitely go back!  While my husband and I have always enjoyed Indian food, we haven't had a lot of experience with it in the past. Phoenix probably isn't really the best place for eating authentic Indian Cuisine, anyway.   However, after living in Japan, they surprisingly had many Indian restaurants in our city that were owned by immigrants from different parts of India. We loved going to these places, and a bonus was that the employees always spoke English!! :P We also visited Thailand, which of course had many incredible Indian restaurants--definitely a good thing since they had a lot of vegetarian options! However, after eating all of this delicious curry and naam from abroad, we couldn't go back to what we were used to... I couldn't even eat the Japanese-style curry anymore.  Naturally, when we got back, I had the urge to eat some curry and naam... so I did a Yelp search to find the best Indian food in the area. Up came India Garden, which I was a bit surprised about because I've driven past it so many times and it didn't look like anything special from the outside. It doesn't look bad at all, but the name and the storefront are rather generic...  I'm so glad we decided to give it a try, though, because inside is awesome!!! They also have a decently-priced lunch buffet, but I hate buffets... I don't like other people breathing over or touching my (potential) food :P I might give it a try though, since they seem very clean at India Garden! Plus, it might be fun to try some new stuff.  We went here for dinner and loved everything we had. Unfortunately, we ordered too much and couldn't finish it all -- this is something I feel really guilty about. We took the leftovers though, but... it's just never the same reheated! :P However, next time we go, I know that the portions are pretty large!!! :) Their drinks were great too. We just had tea (I think... can't remember) but I believe they had a full bar. I can't really remember, though. The staff was also excellent, and it wasn't too busy inside.   Overall, we had a wonderful experience here and would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I'm a true omnivore, but I could be a really happy vegetarian if I only had Indian food to choose from for the rest of my life. My husband and I favor the veggie jalfraizie, korma, and anything involving paneer here. India Garden tailors the spice level to what you request, so don't order a 10 if your favorite spices are salt and pepper. We normally get carryout, which is efficient, but sometimes we'll stay in and enjoy one of their fine Indian lagers with dinner. The food is wonderful and the people who work here are super-friendly."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Authentic Indian Cuisine this is not the place.  The buffet was bland and not stocked well. I would rather eat a frozen entree than dine here again.  I was sad because the reviews were so good."}
{"text":"Worst place and worst people. We were driving from Chicago to Maryland and stopped by at this place. This is the worst thing we had done In our trip. We went for Saturday buffet and there were no one at the restaurant. We served food and seated. We did not like the food. But then we thought we should eat because we came. Chole was bad. There was bad smell coming out of it. My husband went and asked how could they serve bad rotten food. That Gujarati lady at the counter started yelling saying yes it is bad if you want to eat then eat you can leave if you want. Don't make a scene here. I was shocked to hear that. We just paid the bill and left that place. I still repent of paying our valuable 20 bucks for such food and her words. If she is reading this review I want to tell her that she will learn the lesson surely at some point of her life. Bloody bitch"}
{"text":"It was our first time trying Indian food and I have to say it was AMAZING!! We will definitely be back for the buffet as the owner recommended. The restaurant is beautiful inside and the staff was so helpful. We will be regulars for sure!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food here. The quality of the Malai Kofta is incredible. It's full of flavor and the naan is great. As a vegetarian that likes the creamy entrees I prefer to dine in at dinner than go to the buffet. But this is certainly one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Definitely and easily the best Indian restaurant in Ohio! Always greeted graciously and promptly seated.  Never a wait.  Namaste"}
{"text":"Good, but not jump over the moon great.  The masala was good, specially if you like a more tangy masala.  Boyfriend and the tandori chickens, which was also good.  The naan was delicious.  The food wasn't greasy, and the flavors were cleaner and tangy. We will go back again - but we wouldn't drive out of our way to eat there.  Generally a positive experience!"}
{"text":"Great place!  Authentic atmosphere and great service. Don't ask for spicy unless you really want it spicy!    The buffet is really good but the best dishes are on the menu.  Try the garlic nan  so good!    Plates are served family style so it's easy and fun to share!"}
{"text":"I went here my first night in Pittsburgh and didn't really return until the past few months. Suddenly, senioritis plus having a car at school = a late night excursion every week. I still feel the same way about the food, it's good and it's satisfying (but nothing to write home about). The price, however, is so much better. During half-price you can get chicken or vegetarian entrees for half-off.  My favorites dishes include Chicken Saag, Chicken Makhani, and Chicken Tikka Masala. They also do a decent garlic naan.  The only really new thing to say is that I've realized that the service could use some improvement, which is disappointing when you go there every week. There was one time I ordered Chicken Saag and it came with literally two pieces of chicken. It was awkward explaining that this was wrong; same with the time I went with Hao S. and they gave us a dish of rice that was considerably smaller than the last ten times we ate there. Being a regular doesn't really get you much at this place. The waiters won't even hide the fact that they want to try to bustle you out as soon as possible so they can close-up; they have zero interest in even pretending to be interested or friendly the way that most people would in order to make a decent tip."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Indian Garden and my first time eating Indian food in general.   I was nervous walking in as I cannot eat nuts of any kind and was told that many Indian sauces contain nuts. The person who greeted us assured me that I could order anything on the menu and he would make sure that it was absolutely nut free. That being said I felt super comfortable and we got a table.  The inside of the restaurant is completely different from the look of the outside. Very nice atmosphere inside.   I ordered garlic naan bread and the potato cauliflower dish which was served with rice. I ordered it a number 5 for spicy and it was perfect. Everything was delish.   I am giving a four star because it took a very long time (close to 10min) for someone to take our drink order. Perhaps they were very busy for a moment, because that did not reflect the service the rest of our time there. The food and drinks came out super fast and several people stopped to ask how everything was tasting. And the woman refilling the water always made sure our glasses were full to the top.   We will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"This was an incredible delight! Thank you, Ron and Xina. Everything was spot on... HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for lunch because we had the day off on 4th of July weekend. We really enjoyed courteous staff, delicious food, and VERY inexpensive Cava. The place is beautifully decorated and even has outdoor patio seating; that's a win in my book. We were thrilled to have delicious food as well as very polite and attentive staff. They do close at 2:30 to set for dinner service, so be prepared. Definitely order naan with your meal to soak up all of the delicious sauces. I'm not much for spicy, so I got mild. But my friend ordered medium and said it was quite good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"FINALLY an Indian Resturant that stocks a quality IPA.  After years of suffering through the bland Budweiser-esque water/lagers that every Indian restaurant proudly serves, these guys get it. Vindaloo and IPA are both children of Indian colonization and the most perfectly paired culinary match.    The Vindaloo was a solid 4-stars and these folks know how to deliver the heat.  I ordered 8.5 heat which was a good balance. Call me newfangled but I don't mind tomato chucks in my vindy.   Extra star for the IPA. You're doing God's work, keep it up.    Oops, you lost a star for not having a fennel/licorice bowl at the end. The Queen would deduct a point for not having condiments at the table but I was solo today."}
{"text":"Before I even start to review India Garden I need admit that I am an Indian food novice. With that being said it should come as no surprise that I do not have any prior taste of Indian food to compare my meal to, so I am just going to wing it.  As a recently new vegetarian I've been trying to find restaurants that are very veggie friendly, I thought Indian food would be a perfect fit, and if course it was. Before I walked in I had no idea this was a buffet, I wasn't really in the mood for buffet style dining at the time so I was happy to hear they had a regular menu. I started with the assorted vegetable appetizer, it came with broccoli, zucchini, and I think something that resembled squash (whatever it was, it was tasty) everything was fried which I wasn't super excited about but hey a little fried food every once in a while couldn't hurt, it also came with potato pakoras which were fantastic. For my main dish I had  the mushroom matter, it was good but not great, again I don't know if I didn't really like it because I haven't yet become acclimated to the tastes of India or if it was just missing something, it lacked a little flavor. My boyfriend, Sammy  had a shrimp curry dish, he liked it but be sure you really like spice if you tell them you want it hot, he can usually handle extremely spicy food and he was sweating from the heat of his meal they are not messing around with that spice.  The service was good, quick and friendly.  The ambiance it ok, it seems a little too open, and since there is no hostess up front when you walk in your right at someone's table which is a little awkward.  All in all I will probably go back here just to try a few more items but I don't think I am going to make a habit of it."}
{"text":"Varied buffet at lunch time with vegetarian options. Take away or sit in prompt service and consistently good food."}
{"text":"Lamb saag was really good, as was the fried cheese appetizer(can't remember what it was called). The sauces were good too, not sure what the red one was , but the green one (lime and cilantro chutney) goes good with rice and naan. The rice was extra rather than included with entree which is a little disappointing. Overall worth a visit."}
{"text":"I really like this spot, I've gone several times for the lunch buffet and also picked up food to go. The lunch buffet is $10.99, all the classic Indian food served fresh. The owners are usually around too and seem like really good people. Very delicious naan!!!"}
{"text":"In my trinity of favorite Pittsburgh Indian restaurants, India Garden holds the title of \"best buffet\" for sure - there is nothing more relaxing than wandering in on a Sunday afternoon for great Indian comfort food with Bollywood or cricket playing on the TV.  Lots of people have the same idea, so the food on the buffet turns over pretty quickly, and they have a good variety (Do you like goat curry? They have that.) which changes slightly from week to week, so THEORETICALLY you could eat here several weekends in a row and not get bored. Theoretically.  Is the food super-spicy? No, but it is incredibly tasty, and the whole experience feels very comfortable - we've never had an issue with service because we've never come here for a meal off the menu - just buffet. And have been very happy every time.  Maybe that's the secret.  The biggest inconvenience is not the crazy parking on Atwood, it's that India Garden recently changed their weekend buffet hours so they close for a brief period between lunch and dinner. Plan on lunch around lunchtime and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"We tried this today and ordered. Chicken biriyani, chicken rogan josh & garlic naan. Naan was the best. But biriyani & chicken rogan were ok. Chicken was actually taste like tomato chicken. So overall food taste wise 2 and for their great service 1 extra. So 3* :)"}
{"text":"Finally dined in, instead of slinking off with my take-out for one. The atmosphere is cute, and the wait staff was wonderful. The food continues to be really good, but BE WARY of what you order if you don't like spicy food. I always get the mildest chicken korma they'll serve me, and it's delicious. The plain naan also has a really nice basic flavor, which pairs well with the entrees. But dayum - they have some spicy stuff here, so folks like me have to tread lightly. I'll be back again & again! =)"}
{"text":"I came here with a frequent customer who had credible Indian food credentials. Unfortunately, she was a vegetarian, so I was on my own in terms of ordering a main course. The menu is fairly large, and by the time the waiter came to take our orders my friend was prepared while I did not have enough time to thoroughly investigate the menu leaving me in a concealed moment of desperation. I quickly chose the first Tandoori Specialty believing it was placed there for a reason.   The dish was served on a skillet with peppers and onions. My first bite was very peculiar. I had no idea what this mystery meat was, but it was good. As the meal progressed, I started to suspect that I had ordered a Tofu based dish and not a meat one; however, the mystery item I was eating did not have the same texture or base taste as any tofu which I had previously tried. Regardless, the dish was good.  We also shared a basket of naan which was delicious.  I also noticed a reasonably sized buffet which seemed quite enticing.  Upon, post-dining research I have identified that I ordered the Mumtaz Paneer Tikka which is a delicately marinated Indian cheese. I will likely recommend to my friend and would recommend to any Vegetarian or Indian-cuisine enthusiast seeking a novel dish."}
{"text":"The buffet has dropped its quality the last few times weve gone. Less dishes and flavors are not as layered...hope they get their groove back.."}
{"text":"India Garden took the place of Tastings next to Sprouts on Dysart Road. The restaurant is huge inside with a comfortable private room for meetings, parties, etc. Bollywood music videos play on a TV throughout the restaurant.   Came at 9:00pm on a Saturday night. It was pretty empty. We opted to order off the menu vs. the buffet.   The staff was extremely attentive and the owners even came over to speak with us. They were super friendly.   The food was very good, but I'm giving it only 2 stars because it made my stomach upset later that night. No bueno!   Glad there's an indian restaurant on this side of town, considering Sutra on Litchfield recently closed."}
{"text":"For a very long time, I lamented the lack of reasonably-priced Indian food in the Cleveland area. I studied in the UK for a semester many years ago and got spoiled by the easy availability and relative cheapness of fast Indian food, the British equivalent of American fast-Mexican food.  Not that I didn't know there were options here, I just couldn't find anything that really satisfied me. Most of the Indian restaurants I tried were a bit pricey or just too fancy.There was that place that was in the Arcade downtown for a while, but that was about as close as it got, it seemed.   And then I discovered India Garden, whose buffet can't be beat. $8.95 per person is very reasonable for the quality, variety and potential amounts of food you can heap on your plate here.   Regular old dinner is also good and reasonably priced.  They also have an interesting selection of Indian beers and wines.  Really nice servers, too."}
{"text":"The food is flat out amazing and the service is even better. We came for the lunch buffet on a Saturday, and I'm blown away by how good EVERY ITEM from the buffet is. I've had a lot of expensive, plated Indian meals that don't even come close to what I just had at a buffet; unbelievable. And I can't stress enough how warm, attentive, and friendly the entire staff is. ANY time I have a craving for Indian food going forward, this is the only place I'm going."}
{"text":"When my husband and I moved here we both had a hard time finding some great new places to eat -- especially our favorite, Indian. I tried a few of them but they were always a disappointment.  An Indian student in my department suggested I try this place and it has so far been outstanding.   Their palak paneer is my favorite - creamy but not heavy. The chicken Tikka Masala had a great sauce but the order I had, the chicken was pretty dry. I also tried Dal Makhni Maharani - amazing lentil dish. Had a little kick to it and really clean tasting. The nan is also fantastic.   For Indian, this is the way to go. Love this place and look forward to eating there again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Indian Restaurant in Pittsburgh. The staff are friendly and the food is great. Coupons are available for the buffet near the door or next door in the market. Buffet lunch every day and Sunday and Tuesday for dinner"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Indian restaurant in the city.  Very consistent and good.  Authentic decorations and music.  Be ready to search for parking during the college school year."}
{"text":"I usually visit this place to do a takeout for lunch. The food is not that great, it is overpriced and there are very few, if any, patrons inside whenever I stop by. The owner and his wife are not very friendly and they don't seem happy about me coming into their establishment because I am an American born Indian. I am sure they prefer to have only White people eating there. However, the other people working there are nicer toward me. The main reason I went there is because it was across the street from the pharmacy where I worked and did not want to eat the disgusting unhealthy food in the cafeteria."}
{"text":"We ventured over to India Garden the other night in the middle of a blizzard since our work holiday party plans had been canceled due to the weather. So glad we did - this place is now in our regular rotation.   Here's what we had:  Garlic Naan - OMG. We absolutely devoured the side of garlic naan we ordered. It's a decent sized portion for about $2.50 and we literally crushed it in about 3 minutes. So fresh and good.   Chicken Tikka Masala: Very good, lots of good quality meat, seasoned very well.  Goat Biryani - Goat is not my number 1 fave but Sean loves it and said it was awesome. I tried it and I have to admit it was pretty good. Mango Lassi - smooth and delicious - not overly sweet.  Kheer - basically rice pudding with a little cinnamon. A simple treat Gulab Jamun - dough balls served hot in a sweet syrup. Yummy.   A note on spice. I'm a regular ol' white girl who likes moderately spicy stuff. Perhaps spicier than your average person but I don't like my mouth on fire. I ordered a spice level of '6' and it was just at the edge of my limit. Next time I would probably order a 5 just so I can enjoy it a bit more without having to drink so much water lol.  Sean likes things a bit spicier than I do and he ordered a '7' - he had a good forehead sweat going on and said it was good but next time he'll get a 6 for the same reason as me. The man taking our order seemed a bit surprised by our orders of 6 and 7 if that tells you anything - proceed with caution and probably go down one level than your first thought. Very very good flavors though, and not just heat.  Portions - very generous. Mine was definitely enough for 3 meals which is awesome - this stuff makes killer leftovers. I had only about 1/3 of my rice left when they were boxing it up. The very nice waiter (possible owner/manager) brought out a whole new plate of rice to add to my take-out box. Aweseome! Sean's biryani was quite large as well - probably 2 large or 3 smaller meals there too.   I can't wait to get here to try the lunch buffet which sounds amazing and for only $10! Very solid Indian food and lucky it's super close for us. Give it a try if you're in the mood for Indian."}
{"text":"When it comes to Indian food, I'm super picky. I lived in the Pacific Northwest for a long time and there was a nice selection of Indian restaurants to choose from.  So, here is what I liked: 1. The plain Naan was fabulously fresh and delicious. 2. The tandoori chicken was cooked well and wasn't tough. 3. The Rita was really good and had a nice balance of cucumbers, carrots, and pepper.  What I didn't care for: 1. Most buffets I've been to either serve a chicken tikka masala or butter chicken as a second option to the lonely chicken curry. No second option here. 2. They served a Spinach like Saag Paneer minus the Paneer. Come on, where my cheese cubes at?  3. The service is just awful. The servers seem busy but not with waiting on tables. They are not rude, but need to learn to be more attentive.  So all in all, the experience and food were average. Will I go back? Meh, maybe if I can't find another Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area..."}
{"text":"Very happy with vegetarian entrees.  Eggplant, malai kofta, and [something else]--all delicious.  Ordering spice level on a 1-10 scale (as opposed to mild/medium/hot) is a plus.  Cons: No papadum. Lassis (both sweet and mango) while delicious were too sweet."}
{"text":"Always amazing.  The thing I miss most about Cleveland.  Every time I'm in town I try to make it to the best Indian food in the US.  Perfect level of spices.  Amazing service.  All around perfect experience."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 star but the last two times we have gone there's been bones in the chicken Marsala and the rice has been on the dryer side."}
{"text":"The management must have changed because the flavors and care they used to take in each dish is nothing like when we first used to go. I prefer to go to Indian in Scottsdale or in Peoria instead. Very unimpressed. Will not return anymore."}
{"text":"I love trying new foods and different local establishments. I have to say this was he best food, service, and environment I have had the pleasure of experiencing. The owner was wonderful and took the time to treat us like family. The food was amazing and the service was perfect. Even if you do not live in Goodyear, I highly recommend making the drive to the India Garden. I usually do not rant and rave about any place, but I know that you will enjoy it as much as I did.   Please go today!"}
{"text":"We don't eat here enough.  And you doing either.  The food is always delightful and the service some of the best anywhere.  I had a tender chicken tikka served on a sizzling cast iron player.  The chicken was tender on the inside and slightly charred on the outside.  The vegetables were fresh and crisp. The sauce flavorful and with exactly the right amount of heat.  My daughter gobbled down butter chicken with fluffy rice and a mango lassi. I don't recall what my husband ordered and it was gone before i came up for air from the chicken tikka to steal a forkfull. Judging from his speed alone I'd say it too was a hit.  Go.  Right now.  And get a cup of hot chai too."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian on the west side!! I go to this place Everytime I get a chance. I love their lunch buffet which is always rotating. Staff is exceptionally friendly and make you feel at home, food is nicely spiced. An easy place to love"}
{"text":"I have only been here for the lunch buffet, but I've never been disappointed. Neat atmosphere, close to Pitt's campus, and rather inexpensive. Anytime I'm in the mood for Indian food, this is the first place I go."}
{"text":"This place has extremely kind owners who take pride in making sure that your service is great and your food is amazing. They have a nice bar, however, they could do a better job with their decorating. The ambience is nice, but they could really knock things out of the park by putting the same effort they put into their service and food, right back into giving the interior an upgrade. The chicken Tika Masala is my favorite dish."}
{"text":"I don't like cilantro, but everything (except the rice pudding) was saturated with it. The lamb curry was full of it, my chicken sausage things had cilantro cooked into it as an ingredient, and cilantro was liberally sprinkled over the top of my entire meal platter. Even the nan was prepared with cilantro baked into it, with more cilantro sprinkled on top. Ugh. Wish I had had some kind of warning, but I don't think I saw the word \"cilantro\" a single time on the menu.  Also, according to the menu, the meal I ordered included a cup of masala chai, but it wasn't brought out to me. When I asked the waiter about it near the end of my meal, he said that I was mistaken, and that the meal didn't come with the chai. I looked incredulously at him, about to ask him to bring out the menu again so that I could re-read the item description because the inclusion of the chai was one of my deciding factors, but he suddenly backpedaled and said he would go double-check, but he didn't think my meal was supposed to come with a beverage. He came back a minute later with the chai and silently set it beside me without any explanation or apology.  If you love cilantro and get better service than I did, you might classify this place as 3 or 4 stars, but my experience was no more than 2/5."}
{"text":"It's hard to like this place after Taj Mahal--but there were many choices and it wasn't the worst, but it really wasn't the best. Some stuff was over salted and the chicken tikka was dry."}
{"text":"Best Indian Food in the area. More Authentic, Spicy, and Quaint Environment."}
{"text":"I've edited my review from a 2 star to a 4 star and here is why: I've been here 3 times now and each time was different. 2 carry-out orders and one time we went in and sat and ate. The first time, the tikka masala was just okay. The second time, it was better, and the third time, it was perfectly made. I am not sure why you can get varying results from day to day but I wouldn't say the place was bad, just inconsistent at times. Its close to me so I will definitely keep going and trying new things. I had the chicken vindaloo once and gotta say I did not like it, but the owners and staff have all been very nice and friendly, and without asking she removed it from my bill. I left a large tip to compensate for it, it was nice for her to take it off, I had never had it before but wanted to try it, well at least now I know I don't like chicken vindaloo! The curry I have had twice, it's not bad, just always seems to be missing something. It is a bit of a pain that the basmati rice costs so much and is not included in the price of your meal, but this place is also not super expensive either so I guess that's fine, but they could just up the price of the entree and include the rice. I have tried the cheese naan, the garlic naan, and the plain naan- the cheese naan is my favorite, it made the bread really moist. The garlic naan was okay, I guess I don't like the ton of cilantro in it. The naan is the best when it is fresh, once I ordered carryout right before close, the bread was not fresh and was not very good. Not their fault though, I ordered pretty late. I also tried the beef biryani, gotta say did not like it. The rice was dry and the beef was chewy, not a good quality of meat. In fact, out of the beef, lamb and chicken I think the chicken is the best way to go, especially if it's the sauce-like dishes like the masala and curry, because then it's just chunks of chicken not the fat parts of the boney tendoney parts. The beef in the beef biryani I tried was really chewy and tendon-ey, and gave me the impression some of the meats are not good quality. But, can never go wrong with chicken breast! I have also tried the chicken tandoori, and again felt like the meat was not the best quality because it was very fatty and seemed like it had not been trimmed, with many bones and tendons. It had a good flavor and I like the onions with it, but wouldn't order again- between the bones and the fat it's very little protein. I also tried a meat samosa, it was just a fried dough ball with ground meat inside. did not enjoy it- there was nothing wrong with it let me say- the description said it was a fried dough balll with meat inside- it just had no flavor, just fried dough and ground meat/ It came with a green salsa-like sauce though, and that was good. In any case, even though they are inconsistent food-wise, this place is close to me and  I think it's great that it seems to be a family owned private business, and everyone there always is very nice. I am not sure why some people say they arent, i've never had bad service. If I want to drive to Tempe for really great indian food I will, but this place is close, family owned, and although they may be inconsistent at times is pretty decent overall."}
{"text":"My wife and I were very excited to find an Indian restaurant in the West valley.  We had been driving all the way to I-17 and Bell road to get our Indian on and now we have a much closer alternative!  We have been there three times and they have more than exceeded our expectations.  The buffet is terrific and varied with food that is piping hot (so be careful!).  As a vegan, I was pleased to see a salad, fruit and vegetables section of the buffet.  Again, the food is delicious and the service is attentive, don't hesitate to try it out!"}
{"text":"Not that good Indian food.. The taste was not that good but the place was good... Had expected lot more from Indian Garden, but it didn't satisfy me... I think I won't come back..."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place, but I LOVE THIS PLACE.  The first thing I'll admit about this place is that it looks so tacky/corny.  The decor is kind of strange...  It just feels like there's too much going on with decorative pieces, the robustly orange lighting, and the Bollywood channel that's always on and blasting.  BUT, I sort of love the tackiness...and the too much-ness...it's sort of fun.  The waiters and one waitress are kind of funny.  They are pretty hands-off, and it almost feel like they're doing their own thing.  One time a new waitress was being trained I think and she spilled a cup of water while placing it on our table and it spilled on my friend's pants.  I think she was sort of shocked and just started wiping the table while the manager scolded her in front of us.  We moved to a different booth and the manager monitored her for the rest of the time we were there, but they pretty much ignored us except for taking orders.  The food: I am not knowledgeable of Indian food, but I love the food here.  I don't know how it compares to other Indian places or how authentic it is, but if you stick with the popular items on the menu(i.e. chicken masala), you're pretty safe.  They offer half-off at 5pm and 9pm I think so that's pretty sweet.  Of the half-off locations in Oakland this was the farthest from where I lived, but definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch buffet for a great price! We sat on the outdoor patio which is small but very comfortable. Food is fresh, hot and tasty. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Love the fresh naan! Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"So so so good ... Here in Town for Indian spring training so why not eat Indian?  Nice people, attentive service, yummy classic treats .. Arizona!  Don't be a chain sheep and go to Flingers/Zingers/Whipperdejibbits when you can have authentic ethnic cuisine in an up-scale setting ... Get yer butt here and feast!"}
{"text":"I miss you IG! I didn't realize how hard it is to find a good Indian Restaurant  until I left Pittsburgh. I usually went for the half off deals for an early (4pm-6pm) or really late (after 9:30 or 10...i forget) dinner. My favorite dishes were chicken korma, palak paneer and chicken biryani. During the day, they also have a buffet for $8. If you go on a Saturday they serve this fried bread, really tasty. IG has the most and best selections for lunch buffet. It even includes a good variety of desserts.  My mouth is salivating just thinking about it. The owner and waiters are really nice too."}
{"text":"Solid Indian buffet option  Nice restaurant option next to Sprouts in Avondale.  Place is clean, food is good, and you can wrap up a lunch in less than an hour.  I'm a fan of naan, and theirs is straightforward tasty.  Service staff are par for the course-- good at getting you started, so-so on keeping drinks filled, and take care of the check quickly.  Minimal personal interaction, but that's cool if you're looking to enjoy the company of your companions.  The little TV was something of a distraction.  Would rank it a star up if they had more meat options in the buffet.  Most of it is vegetable oriented.  Nominal dessert options, as well."}
{"text":"Oh MY - I love you India Garden - great atmosphere, great cuisines, Authentic deliciousness !!! 5 Stars - I had not found anything I liked where I live & now I can enjoy a little bit of Indian"}
{"text":"India Garden was so great! They put so much care into their presentation, really capturing authentic cultural and art galore. Each table was beautifully set, with cloth napkins folded into glasses sitting on a red tablecloth. I really appreciated how nice everything looked.   The food was DIVINE!! We ordered all vegetarian and if the vegetarian was any telling of their meat dishes then you can't go wrong either way. The food was very tasty with lots of spice and flavor. I got a lentil dish that I would eat with naan and a chili powder that they gave us. It was a lentil dish for a king. I just couldn't get enough. My friend ordered a masala dish that I would have gladly ordered twice because of its heavenly nature. Delish, palatable, and gratifying are some adjectives I would use to describe it. My taste buds are salivating right now just thinking about it.   The service was amazing. They were very nice and respectful and gave us TWO COMPLIMENTARY DISHES. An Indian milk tea and a serving of garlic naan. I couldn't figure out what the compliments were for, but both things they gave us were very good and I'm very grateful. The server even knew what one of us was ordering before she had a chance to speak. Now that's dedication.   All in all, a great, authentic place run by very nice people with sensational food."}
{"text":"My family has dined at this location on numerous occasions, and it has always been a great experience. The place is decorated well, has super clean white linens on the tables, and the fantastic music played on the TV's only heightens the experience.   We've enjoyed both the lunch buffet and individual meals, and each meal has been pleasant and delicious. The staff is courteous and enjoys explaining what is in each dish, they often bring us special drinks to try too.   The ginger chicken and ginger shrimp is just about the best thing I have ever tasted. It has a zing to it that really brightens up what could be a very plain dish. The chicken is cooked with a lot of care and flavor.   If you're a Naan person, you are going to love this place! They have so many different options! The garlic Naan is out of this world! The buttery Naan is great, and the one with raisins is spectacular too! The prices are a little high, but not outrageous. This is a dining destination on the west side of town."}
{"text":"I love their lunch buffet. Friendly service. Quiet atmosphere. Perfect lunch get away."}
{"text":"I would have given a 0 if it was possible....we were 10 people just came to visit pittsburg and thought we should give it a try but it was an utter disappointment nothing was fresh except deserts....the worst of the restaurants i have ever visited. Please dont go to this restaurant its waste of money and time.....!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight with my wife and 15 month old daughter.  Amazing food and top-notch service.  It lived up to the hype.  Definitely worth checking-out.    I'm told they have lunch buffet 7-Days per week for only $10."}
{"text":"Yum! I grew up eating Indian food cooked by my aunt (who married a Punjabi man), and to a very small extent, my mom, and have been to India twice. While I'm sure that those of Indian heritage may find some fault as it is not like their mom cooks(ed), this Irish girl LOVES India Garden. I've sampled much on the menu, but come back to my favorites - Chicken Korma, Chicken Tikka Masala, and Aloo Jeera. Their naan and paratha are outstanding as well. The atmosphere is perfect, and the service is very good. Everyone is so friendly. If you are a fan of Indian food and haven't tried India Garden, I suggest checking it out."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable visit last evening.  Extensive menu, delicious food, full bar, excellent service...looking forward to dining here again on our next visit to the area."}
{"text":"If you look for truly authentic and delicious Indian food, you will not be able to pass by India Garden."}
{"text":"Great Indian food this side of the Valley.  Located in Avondale off Dysart with lots of available parking.   The restaurant itself isn't fancy, and upon entering, is a large room with tables and chairs.  No small nooks or partitions for privacy.  Adequate lighting with small screen TV's on the wall playing Indian music.  The tables and chairs are adequately spaced with lots of room between adjoining tables and chairs.  Staff are friendly and acknowledged us immediately on entering.  Menus were immediately brought to the tables along with water glasses being filled as well. Menus were easy to comprehend and staff answered any questions we had. My only issue is that I didn't like the pricing structure for the dishes, i.e. one had to order items of their dish separate.  For example, if you order the Curry Chicken dish, it doesn't come with rice or Naan bread, those items had to be ordered separately (-1).  My opinion is that as highly priced as some of the dishes are, perhaps it should include simple side dishes to accompany the main dish. Overall, great restaurant, staff, and the food tasted great.  I heard they offer a lunch buffet which will certainly bring me back!"}
{"text":"Went during lunch over the weekend, and it was easily one of the very best Indian buffets I've had a chance to eat at.  The spinach and mushroom dish was delicious, as were all of the vegetarian options here.  Whereas it doesn't seem a major thing, the condiment bar; chutneys, raita, kheer, etc, was one of the most complete I've seen.  Will head there again."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Phoenix. Period. Also you won't find nicer owners that treat you like family."}
{"text":"Last weekend, I found myself in Ohio where I read some AMAZING reviews on yelp for this Indian spot. It did not disappoint. From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall, but inside it is very homey. There is limited space. I think the place holds about 50 people unless there was a back section I was not aware of. Everything was delicious from the naan to the lamb saag to the tandoori chicken. I highly recommend if it you are in the area. The servers were friendly and attentive and they want to ensure everyone has the best experience.    Tip:  You can order every dish on a hot scale of 1-10 (10 being the hottest) and they can give you a sample of their sauces to see what you can take!"}
{"text":"This place is quite good, we came for the lunch buffet at noon on a Friday.  It wasn't too crowded, and it was very quiet.  They do a cool thing where they keep the rice in a closed cooker, so it doesn't dry out in a chaffing dish.  There's a rice paddle in water next to it.  This is also valuable info if you've not been here before.  Just pop the button and open the lid.  I had spinach, goat, and chicken tikka masala.  The spinach was bland, stay away.  But the goat was quite good.  You have to fight it off the bone a bit, but it was worth the struggle.  My favorite was the chicken.  It was tender and moist, not what I was expecting from a buffet.  It is what will bring us back.  They also had gulab jamun in the cold section.  They are small baked balls made of sugar, flour, sugar, yogurt, and sugar.  Try them!"}
{"text":"I love India Garden. I've been here several times before to pick up food. I've actually never sat in or eaten inside the restaurant. I've always just ordered my food to go. Everything I've eaten here is tasty and seems very authentic Indian food. My roommate is from India and she is vegetarian. She likes everything she has ordered here. I've had their Chicken biryani and also vegetable dishes like lentils and okra. I LOVED it all so I know I will definitely be back. The food comes in large quantities so you could possibly save half for lunch or dinner the next day.   Service is great and the owner I spoke to in person while I was picking up my food is a really nice guy.   This is my 121st Yelp review overall.  75 reviews for 2018. I am aiming for 100 reviews in 2018. Reviewed on 19 June 2018."}
{"text":"Okay so I love love LOVE this place!!!!!!  It's absolutely amazing!! My friend and I went It to give It a try, first time ever trying Indian food and my oh my It was so delicious. The servers were so sweet and kind! This is our new fav spot!!!!"}
{"text":"You know, I was here ~2 years ago and I was a HUGE fan. After coming back for 2nds, I can def say I had one too many drinks last time to be craving for more. It was okay, but like what everyone said, the service is poor. Furthermore, for Indian food, it's pretty expensive for what you get. I can get the same stuff w/ mildly better service in San Francisco for much less. I probably wouldn't come back again, but it was a let-down not being able to re-experience India Garden in all its glory like how I remembered it. =["}
{"text":"We had lunch at India Garden this afternoon...excellent choice.  The food was delicious and the service was impeccable.  We were a bit aggressive with our spice level when ordering and the sever quickly recognized it and brought out two sauces with bread that we could test first.  How great is that...he didn't want us to ruin our entree...and of course we both dropped our spice level down.   The food was hot, perfectly spiced and absolutely delicious...and of course there was the naan, yum! I live in  D.C. and will definitely come back to India Garden next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were for the lunch buffet.  I've been to many Indian Buffets before, but I'm going to say India Garden's is the best.  What makes this place stand out from the others is the fact that there is always plenty of -fresh- food.  You don't feel like you're eating curry that's been sitting there for a few hours.  I think it helps that they have lots of customers, so the turnover rate is high.  Plus, the naan here is soooooooo yummy.  It's thick, chewy, soft and frickin' delicious.  I would come back here just to eat the naan (dipped in some of their tamarind and onion chutneys).  They have several vegetarian options as well as more curries for the meat-eaters.  Their salad bar is the only part that's lacking, but that's OK since one shouldn't go to an Indian buffet to eat salads.  The service was great also.  They immediately sat me at a table when I walked in and my water glass never fell below the halfway mark.  The lunch buffet costs $8.99 per person and is worth every penny.    Do yourself a favor and skip breakfast before you come here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. Came here for the lunch buffet on Sunday. The naan bread they serve to the table was excellent and I also enjoyed the curry was savory. What some might not know is that they also have self serve chai tea in the middle of the buffet. It was great way to end the meal with a side of kheer. All in all I really enjoyed myself. I paid around $14 and I would definitely come again."}
{"text":"There are not enough stars I can give India Garden. They really are one of the best restaurants in the area. I came in for the lunch buffet. The waiter told me that my normal dish wasn't on the buffet and went in the back and had a special order made for me. The food is always spectacular. The staff is always attentive with beverages and anything else you need. I really can't give enough praise to them."}
{"text":"I love India Garden!  I eat here VERY often (almost always the lunch buffet). At first, you will think the place is small but you will learn to love the coziness.    The reason I give this place 5 star is because of the servers and the the \"bang for the buck.\" Amazing food for $9 all you can eat. Servers are super nice especially when you are a regular.  You should eat here. And invite me, please."}
{"text":"I admit I was a little scared to try this place. This was the 3rd Indian Restaurant we've tried since moving from Seattle and they all disappointed until this one!  It was Christmas day and the second we walked in the smells from the kitchen started to make my mouth water! We decided to go with things we knew the first visit and they did not disappoint! We had:  Chicken Makhni: Perfectly Creamy and delicious with the the right amount of spices. The chicken was juicy and cooked to perfection.  Basamati Rice: Not my favorite of the Indian Rice I've had, but cooked perfectly.. I would have just preferred it to be more fragrant.  Tandoori Mixed Grill: We went with the mix so we could try everything. It came with chicken breast/chicken thigh and leg/lamb/shrimp/sausage. The chicken breast was to die for, it was even juicier then the thigh/leg that came with it! Lamb was good, although it was a little to \"strong\" tasting for my husband who doesn't really enjoy lamb in the first place, the only one I wasn't crazy about was the shrimp but I've never had shrimp tandoori that I really enjoyed so it may just not be my thing.  Cheese Naan: This was my only real complaint (if you could call it that) We asked the waitress if the Naan bread was made with paneer (which we love) and she said yes, but when it came it looked more and tasted like they just sprinkled it with shredded mozzarella cheese. The Naan bread was good.. but I would have preferred it with paneer, or the garlic naan.  Overall, It was delicious and way better then any other Indian Restaurants in the valley, we can't wait to go back for their lunch buffet so we can try a different selection of food."}
{"text":"I have been here about a dozen times; only to the lunch buffet on weekends. The service is the best I've experienced. I've never had my water glass less than half full before they top me off, and the naan arrives hot and fresh before I realize I need more. The food iteself is excellent; the only drawback on the buffet is that the selection is smaller than what I've seen at most other restaurants. If they expanded the buffet from 8 to 12 items, this would be my #1 restaurant. So...a 4 star buffet with 6 star service = 5 stars."}
{"text":"We went for the lunch buffet a couple weeks ago.  It was fabulous, and all the servers, chef, etc. were extremely nice.  We'll be back there soon for sure."}
{"text":"I highly recommend coming here ONLY during the lunch buffet. It is a pretty good value and always delicious. Fresh naan is served upon arrival and the buffet always offers some type of chicken curry or masala and tandoori chicken,palak paneer, veggie curries, salad, sometimes goat curry and a few other options. It also has Chai, but it isn't good. I don't recommend coming for dinner. The menu is a la carte and a bit pricey for what you get. The portion sizes are very small and you don't get any rice or naan. We ordered a goat curry dish and chicken curry dish and there was only about 5-6 pieces of meat in the dish servings. They ran about $13-15 too! We expected a lot more for that price. I think rice and/or naan should come standard with dishes here (especially in that price range). The service is always spectacular and super friendly."}
{"text":"Great service, great Indian food and a moderately priced wine list?  I'm in.  We went for dinner on Saturday night.  The place was lively, but we were able to get a seat without reservations.  The host and staff were extremely helpful, polite, friendly and professional.  They helped me understand the heat factor on several different dishes.  NB, a 4 out of 10 on the heat scale is not as hot as one would think.  Go up a notch if you want spicy.  Fragrant papadams, giant samosas, garlicky fresh naan, heavenly paneer pakoras... then it got even better.  I had ginger lamb-- which was inticate, bright, bold and just plain exquisite.  My dearest had the chicken korma-- also vivid and well balanced.  The wine list was priced from $20-$28 dollars (!!!!) and included some well chosen selections.  Our Oregon pinot gris went very well with all the spices in our dinner.  Located near the boarder of Rocky River and Lakewood, I think this will become my go-to place after theatre at the Beck."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I love Indian food.   Let me clarify this by saying that despite my ongoing curried devotion, I really have a difficult time ordering from the menu at Indian restaurants because I have a hard time deciding on just one or two dishes.    Enter my savior - The India Garden buffet.   I have been to Indian buffets before (anyone else miss Indigo downtown?) but India Garden's lunch buffet has been consistently amazing for the last two years that I have been going.  For less than $10, you are treated to 3-4 meat dishes (usually chicken and goat) as well as an additional selection of 3-4 vegetarian items.  Add to this a plentiful supply of freshly baked naan and you can't go wrong.    On top of the excellent food, the service is superlatively good, and the staff is incredibly friendly.  Whether alone or with the whole family in tow, they have always been remarkably welcoming and accommodating.   India Garden is another of the many treasures Lakewood has to offer."}
{"text":"This is best Indian restaurant I have found in my 21 years of life The prices are decent and the food is Delicious!  the place is small so don't plan on getting a table for no more then 6 although I was there last Sunday for a Convention and my dude was able to work out something where I got a table for 12 I recommend the lamb curry"}
{"text":"Less than $10 including sales tax for Indian lunch buffet? Sign me up!! While the decor is a bit overwhelming with the draperies and all the deep red color, the buffet offers quite a bit of selection for an empty stomach. The offering is hot and tasty, and I tried everything from the buffet including the dessert. The garlic naan that we ordered was fresh too, full of garlicky goodness and herbs with some crisp on the edges. Service was okay and when we decided to leave we just went up to the host to pay (not sure if that was proper protocol). We went around 1pm and not crowded at all so go late! Such a good cheap eats place and you will be full for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to meet for dinner when I'm catching up with a friend or two I haven't seen in a while. It seems that the pace is always leisurely - not slow - lending itself to a nice two-hour or so dinner in a quiet atmosphere.   My last visit, the Monday before Christmas, my friend and I were there for dinner on a particularly busy evening. Our entrees took a little longer than usual to arrive (although we didn't even notice at first), so our server brought over complimentary Vegetable Korma to snack on while we waited. Those were super delicious!  I ordered my main dish spicy (a 9 on their spicy scale) and it did not disappoint! It was REALLLYY hot, and this is coming from an Asian with a high tolerance for all things spicy. A delicious mango lassi tempered the heat from the curry, so it was all good.   Overall, I have to say that this, along with Udupi in Parma, is probably the best Indian in the area!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints about the service here but their lunch buffet is seriously lacking. I have been to other Indian buffets and they have almost 3x as many dishes as this restaurant. The goat dish was a paltry 2 pieces of actual goat; instead there were many pieces of sharp bones mixed in the rice. The dessert section had only two items--this sugary mound of gloop and pieces of watery honeydew. Thankfully, this was a company event so I did not have to pay, because the value and variety of the food is not up to par with a normal buffet."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian food I've had.  Having lived and eaten my way around Ohio for the last 20 years, I always compare Indian places back to Amar India (Dayton) and Aab (Grandview). This place trounces them both!  First, the service: this is a place where you can tell business is a point of personal and family pride. The main waiter is involved in ownership and really took the time to talk to us about the menu with an enthusiasm that was fun and refreshing. In fact, the guy was so excited it was our first time in, he brought us out some Indian milk tea and a dessert later on, on the house. He was genuinely interested in our opinions of our dishes and checked up on us throughout the meal.  We ordered the famous garlic naan, chicken saag, and chicken tikka masala. It's impossible to make garlic naan bad but the latter two dishes were incredibly flavorful, savory, and balanced. It was the type of meal you constantly look over at your dinnermate with wide eyes mouthing phrases like \"whoa\", \"wow\", and \"holy sh$t\".  The prices seemed fair ($30ish for 2) and we left with enough leftovers for probably 2 lunches.  This place crushes and we feel lucky to have found such an incredibly great Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"I just ordered the chicken tikka masala to go and it was outstanding. Had the option of selecting a spice level of 1-10, 5 being medium. I asked for more spicy than 5. It came with garlic nan bread. The order was sufficient for two people. So tasty, quality food. Outstanding restaurant.   The fantastic people are the icing on the cake. I was greeted at the door by a gracious young lady. I thought initially there was a buffet (only at lunch) and could grab some food and go. She noted that an order would take 15-20 minutes. There were a fair number of other patrons in the restaurant. I made a face of \"kind displeasure\" and she said hang on, maybe we could get your order out in about 10 minutes. I think it came out sooner than that. When asked what I wanted to order, I said something good and something traditional. So my specific order was her suggestion. I called back after bringing my meal home and eating half. I spoke with the owner to tell him how amazing the food is; and professional yet personable the hostess is. He too was gracious and offered a heartfelt thanks. Again he said, thank you for your patronage.   Two thumbs up. I only have two hands otherwise would hold up more thumbs. I will return for dine-in and take-out meals!  Ioved to Rocky River three years ago and have driven by this place many times. I wish I would have tried it sooner."}
{"text":"I mainly come here to get my fix of Bollywood music videos. I'm also fascinated by those little metal cups that they serve water in.  The food's not bad either. Not superb, but not bad. The naan, on the other hand, is purty darn good. IG is definitely one of the better dining options in Oakland. Make sure to stop by for their lunch buffet or in the evening for the 1/2 off special to catch great deals.  Parking generally blows, but it's Oakland...what's new?"}
{"text":"The only Indian restaurant I've been to in the PHX southwest area. The service is always great and the dishes I've ordered are always delicious! I've never been here with more than 5 tables seated so I am always served fast. I highly recommend to anyone who enjoy Indian food or willing to try!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Indian food.  Very friendly and gracious staff.  My wife and I totally love coming here and sharing a flying horse beer.  Our favorite is the Korma, but we are always pleasantly surprised by the food.  Best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I went to the dentist on Friday and called off for the rest of the day to recover from the teeth cleaning. I called up my brother for lunch. We went to India Garden. I stuffed myself on the buffet. I usually do not like eating buffet style for a bunch of different reasons. The many different options made me think differently about it and I am glad that I did. My brother got some kind of vegan bean dip with a heat level of 11. That reminds me of Spinal Tap, when they say they have their amps go past 10 to get even more loud then before. It was pretty good and spicy. The buffet was definitely impressive for $8 and I got my money's worth. This is a great restaurant with a friendly staff and pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in the Cleveland/nearby Cleveland area.  First visit was an all-vegetarian experience and it was so good that I had to go back.  As someone with often a carnivorous appetite, that says a lot!  Second time around, with more meaty fare, was just as pleasant.  Absolutely delicious vegetarian and meat options.  The saag is a little unusual in that it's much creamier and more fine-blended.  At first one might thing the color is slightly off or they're skimping on the amount of spinach or that it's not as fresh.  But, once tasted and you'll forgive the color and love the texture.  Flavorful, well-seasoned, and spiced appropriately (If you tell them medium spicy, they'll give you the real deal.  None of that \"indian level spicy\" or \"little spicy\").  The portions are perfect, not too small as encountered in many indian restaurants.   And for a middle tier restaurant (ie. not hole in the wall, not 3 piece suit attire snobbery) the service was exceptional.  The manager/owner greets his guests as if they are frequent customers whom he knows personally.  He's attentive and makes sure his waiters are on the ball.   Also, if you ask about a dish, he'll give you suggestions too.  Real suggestions.  Not like when you ask some waiters what the best dish is and then they run through the entire entree list.  Haven't tried their lunch buffet, but that would be an amazing deal if they serve equally good food."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in the city! Everything is so fresh. My husband is a huge fan of the lunch buffet. I ordered the chicken korma (spice: 3) and my husband ordered chicken rogan josh (spice: 5). The food can get very spicy. My dish was about at spicy as mild buffalo wings. We ordered garlic naan and samosas to round out our meal. The naan was fragrant and the garlic was fresh. It was an easy way to cool my palate. I will definitely go back. However, I probably won't order delivery. It took long than expected and the texture of the naan changed due to condensation."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING! The food was incredible and the service was excellent. This was the first time I had ever eaten Indian food and the server was very helpful and took the time to describe all of the dishes and offer suggestions. The prices were very reasonable and the atmosphere was great. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Terrific food, mediocre service.    I have to admit that so far, this was the best Indian/Pakistani food I have ever had in the US or England (where Indian/Pakistani food abounds)!  My friend and I began with somosas.  I thought they were terrific, I liked how they were fried perfectly, not too crispy, not too soft.  The filling was meaty and tasty and spiced just perfectly.  My dinner companion thought the shell/crust was too dough-y, I did not, it was the 2nd best samosa I've ever had ( the best was a the graduation party of an Indian student of mine).    I had an old fave, Lamb Korma.  It was just terrific, absolutely terrific.  There was lots and lots of lamb, I was shocked.  The gravy was extremely tasty.  I could taste the occasional raisin, and it was obviously cooked in the lamb fat.    The nan was also marvelous.  It wasn't overcooked or undercooked and nice and chewy.  I love to scoop the korma and rice with the nan like one would do with Nepalese food.  I'll definitely be back.  The service is mediocre to poor.  We were ignored."}
{"text":"This may be my favorite Indian Restaurant in the US to date.  Over the years, I've had several friends who live in Pittsburgh. One lived right down the street from India Garden, and she introduced me to the restaurant. Every time I go back to Pittsburgh, IG is a must-stop.  Not only are they open super-late, which is really nice if you have a student schedule, or happen to be rolling into town after a 4-hour car ride late at night, but dinner is half-off then, too! And its delicious Indian food, with a pretty wide variety of options, including a good vegetarian selection.  If only this place were in Austin. We could use some better Indian food here."}
{"text":"The chicken tiki masala was delicious! We've only ordered takeout but we can't wait to dine in and try more entrees!"}
{"text":"Went this week for the lunch buffet. It was delicious with a good variety of flavors and sauces and some dishes I've never had before. I've been eating Indian cuisine since my college days when friends took me home with them to their mother's cooking. That's over 30 years ago and all the restaurants in between, and I must agree with one of the reviewers, this ranks up there with the best. The price is appropriate to the freshness and quality. Excellent service as well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My New Year's Eve started out here with a party of six. I was the only one not wearing black. Yes, it was another night out with the gothic/ anime people. We started with some apps. My wife and i had fried veggie patties which she referred to as \"Indian fair food\".Those things were great. Our main courses were rice and veggies for her and cheese cubes in gunk aka mattar paneer for me. They were both filling and mildly spiced as requested. The naan bread was extra. Total bullshit, man.  They do have a large amount of vegetarian dishes, but they are all basically the same thing. Cheese or veggies in mashed up tomato sauces. The only previous experience i've had with Indian is buying the Kitchen of India sides at Giant Eagle. They're always good, which led me to believe i would like dining out Indian. The other folks all had shrimp dishes and noted that they were not spicy enough, but they did only order around a \"4\" on the heat scale. All dishes came with plain rice. The dining ended with little pancake ball desserts for the ladies and coffee for myself. It was three bucks, but a very tasty cup of coffee indeed. Total bill for wife and i came to fifty with tip. I can see myself going back in about a year.  The space is very intimate. Almost like a living room with tables in it. It is decorated with some romantic lighting and  shimmery  table linens under glass tops. Service was attentive and knowledgeable. The night continued with a jaunt across the street to Simone's for booze and a small party where we all watched Heathers. Alas, no Corn Nuts."}
{"text":"Phenomenol Indian food! This is restaurant is definitely in the top 5 of Indian restaurants in Cleveland. The service was great! We ordered Lamb and Goat and both were consistently tender and delicious. Their spice level is consistent too, they really do make great food! I highly suggest this restaurant for any night of the week!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The place is a little small but the overall experience has been fantastic. Great appetizers, specials, and curry. The last time we went there our dishes weren't as spicy as we would have liked but aside from that, it's been fantastic."}
{"text":"Ah yes! My favorite place to eat at! They're lunch buffet is soo good! They have Chicken Tandoori and Chicken Curry, best combination ever. I highly recommend this place to those who want to eat something different than your regular lunch buffet.  Also for Friday lol nah events they serve goat curry as well! I love it so much? 5 stars way up! Great service and the place is very clean."}
{"text":"Great buffet!  Awesome selection of Indian Dishes.  Their Garlic Naan is great.  The Indian Tea is a great post-meal drink!"}
{"text":"This place was my original favorite Indian place in Cleveland. I've gone here over the years many times. Everyone is always very friendly and accommodating and I've always had a good experience hospitality wise.   This place is set apart from other local Indian places for having a rather nice interior and an extensive alcohol menu.   The food is always cooked well too and when taking left over food to go they will usually offer you additional fresh rice at no charge.   Chicken Tikka Masala is my go to dish at Indian restaurants everywhere. Comparing this dish here to others, I have to say the flavors are a bit weak. I'm not talking about heat, but it's just the overall seasoning and flavor I find to be lacking. I'm not sure if this is a recent thing or if the dish has been consistent over the past 4 years and I've just grown accustomed to it....  Speaking of flavor the Samosas were also a bit on the bland side. They were very mildly spiced, and it may have been just me but the pastry shell seemed a bit thicker than I'm used to having at other no doubt highly Americanized Indian restaurants.   For the first time I gave Lamb Vindaloo a try here. This dish was more flavorful. The lamb was lean and tender and fell right apart. Sphere potatoes were included in the sauce and were cooked well also. A number 7 on the 1-10 heat scale was not overpowering.   I've got to say the Onion Kulcha, basically naan stuffed with onions & herbs, was very good and something I've not seen on other local menus, but will now certainly look out for. There were various types of stuffed bread on the menu in addition to your typical garlic naan.      While they certainly score no points on interior decorating, I have to say my favorite Chicken Tikka Masala comes from Indian Delight. India Garden is a nicer place, but it really is all about the food. Perhaps next time I need to get my Masala as hot as possible and see if that helps any before I say farewell to an old time favorite."}
{"text":"Service was amazing.  My bill was incorrect.  Mentioned this to the waiter and he gave me a discount.  Huge menu.  I ordered the non-vegetarian dinner.  So much food.  Food was amazing.  The waiter gave me a side of tandoori chicken for free.  Very tasty.  Best Indian food in the west valley.  The place was super clean.  You can choose between buffet or a la carte, lunch and dinner time.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious!! We go from the lunch buffet and the variety is great! Always fresh and definitely made with love. A must in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Went to eat here for the first time it was clean and food was very good.. We had the buffet and it was very reasonably priced.  We will  be returning soon ."}
{"text":"Ordered bhindi masala for take out and received a yogurt curry with nothing in it...just the curry base. -______- Called the restaurant and the guy offered a rain check next time I order. So I guess that makes up for it somewhat.   Samosas and pakodas were good. Aloo tikki left something to be desired. Kadai chicken was average, nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Kind staff. Great music playing in the background.  Exactly what I was in the mood for when i decided to look for Indian food.  My friends and I have declared this will be a regular spot.  Oh and I went for spicy level 7, I think next time I'm going for 10!"}
{"text":"This is my first experience with East Indian food. The price is hard to argue with. The selection of foods is pretty limited but also pretty tasty. I liked it."}
{"text":"Since we love vegetarian Indian food and we travelling through Pittsburgh decided to give this place a try. A big mistake.   First the decor - it is straight out of the 60s!  The tables have plastic covers on them which are cheesy.  Second the place seems family run and hence service is slow.   They have a buffet onsite but we decided to go a-la-carte.  Finally, the food was spicy (even when ordered mild) and tasteless. We ordered the Yellow Dal and Makni Paneer. Had it not been for the cucumber/tomato yogurt Raita we would not be able to digest those  dishes. The pooris were more like bhaturas, thick and heavy."}
{"text":"India Garden is my favorite Indian food in Pittsburgh. They have the best chicken tikka masala, warm delicious garlic naan and yummy mango lassi. They are also very reasonable. They are open 11:30-2:30 for lunch buffet and 5pm-11pm every night. The owner and staff are extremely kind and it has a cozy feel to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were on our continued hunt for good Indian food and decided to try India Garden.  One other patron was seated when we arrived just about noon and we began to doubt our choice.  Neither of us are fans of buffets so we had a look at the selections offered before deciding to try it.  Since we choose to eat vegetarian most of the time we were happy with the selection offered.  Everything was (heat) hot and nicely seasoned.  I have eaten a lot of Indian food both in restaurants and in private Hindu homes.  Although this was no where close to how good home cooked Indian is, it satisfied my craving for the time being.  The next time we go we are going to order off the menu and perhaps my three stars will become four."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Indian on the west side (or any side of your motivation is awesome cuisine!) then India Garden is the place for you! My favorite is the lunch buffet- soooo many options! The menu changes daily but the food is always good. I love the variety of being able to sample so many options and then to go fill my plate with my favorite foods! I've also enjoyed dinner from the menu here. The quality is just as good, but I prefer the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculously amazing! Chicken Tikka masala was perfect. Best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Ate here with my son. He had chicken curry and I had the lamb. We ordered appetizers and entrees. We both enjoyed our meals and tasted each other's. Service was prompt and friendly. Prices were average for the portions except for the beer I ordered. It was pricey. We will eat here again."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout about a week ago and was thrilled to taste the quality of food. I ordered that Chicken Vindaloo, wife had Chicken Curry, and we also got the Chicken Biryanis. All of it was wonderful. Our friend ordered the Karahi Chicken which I had never had before, and I'm now hooked. One of the best Indian/Pakistani dishes I've ever eaten. We will be back for sure! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"My partner and I just left and were disgusted by our experience. It's not often I harshly critique a restaurant, but this restaurant deserves to have its reputation tarnished. We walked in shortly after 5 PM on a Saturday evening and were initially greeted and shown to our booth. I have never before sampled Indian fare (and never will after this experience) so I was extremely excited to try it. I was prepared to shell out quite a bit of cash to have an all-out authentic Indian cuisine experience to try to cap off an early Valentine's Day date, yet we ended up paying $24 for two half-plates of terrible food. After sitting at our booth for ten minutes (the restaurant was NOT crowded) we just assumed it was buffet-styled only and went to each grab a plate. I had no idea what anything was and just tried to sample a small bit of everything. The food was barely warm, wasn't seasoned (isn't Indian food supposed to be spicy?), and there wasn't any naan, which my partner told me was tasty bread.   After being grossed out by our food my partner asked if there was a way we could receive menus and order food from them instead. The server proceeded to ignore his inquiry. He discussed just leaving without paying in total disgust for the lack of service and awful food, but we promptly paid and left. For what it's worth we watched as another larger group walked in behind us and were approached at their table and asked if they wanted the buffet or to see a menu. I have half a mind to suspect we were treated so rudely due to our sexual orientation.   In seeing the reviews below if THIS is what you Pittsburghers consider to be great food then you obviously lack any sense of culinary expertise. I would love to thank India Garden for ruining my first foray into Indian cuisine along with our Valentine's Day."}
{"text":"This has become my go-to restaurant for Indian food, whether I am dining in or ordering take-out. Service is consistently good, and the food is great. On Sunday evening I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo and the Chana Masala and both were delicious. The naan is also great, although it is best eaten fresh so getting it to-go makes it loose some of its softness.   I know they have some great deals on certain nights (half-off?!?!), but I don't know the details."}
{"text":"I don't like to give bad reviews.  I like to find the good in places.  The good:  The dal makhani was great.  the kheer and gulab jamoms were nice.  great fluffy basmati rice.  The selection is extensive.  I was impressed...  But..... Although my food did not have hair in it, but my friend's did.  I couldn't get a 2nd glass of water.  The table was dirty, and not because it was busy.  I can deal with that.  I've eaten street food in Mumbai.  I don't need white glove treatment, really.  My issue was the price vs. quality of service ratio.  This place is not worth $11.99 for a buffet. Sorry."}
{"text":"Do you know the meaning of love? Have you questioned it, don't think it exists? Go to India Garden. We went in on Super Bowl Sunday and no one else was there so we got special treatment! They answered lots of our questions and gave us free appetizers!"}
{"text":"This is my go to for Indian food!  I have had the buffet 20 times or more over the years and have never had any complaints!  I was there frequently for either the buffet or dinner while I was pregnant.  The owner would seat me and promptly bring my water and drink without me having to ask.  The staff has always been fantastic to me and the parties I have been there with!  The buffet is a great value and honestly my only complaint is now as a mom I wish they had a changing station in the ladies room!"}
{"text":"This has definitely been an amazing experience for the entire family! It's our new favorite place to eat.  Not just because the food is mind blowing amazing, but because  Mona and Anil have such great hospitality and customer service I totally recommend them to anyone looking for the best Indian food in Az."}
{"text":"Believe it or not,this is some of the best Indian food you're going to find in the US.  It's OK for buffet,but if you have an idea of what decent Indian food is,go a la carte.  Great tandoori,interesting naans and pretty good curries if you know what you are doing."}
{"text":"India Garden opened up recently and they offer both lunch and dinner buffet.  Food selection is fairly good but I have mixed feelings about the place being a 100% buffet focused operation, even though a menu is available just in case you would like to order something different.  Buffet had about 4 vegetarian entrees and 1-2 meat entrees, potato pakoras, dessert, and came with freshly made plain or garlic naan.  Not all items were hot, but nearly all were rather tasty.  Prices were reasonable.  Parking is ample.  Very open space kind of place, with an old wooden bar that isn't really used much for a bar.  I was a bit surprised to see 5-6 draft beers available."}
{"text":"Delicious food and lots of vegetarian and vegan (if you specify no cream or butter) options. Very friendly service and great atmosphere, would recommend to all!"}
{"text":"Great deal for the buffet. They have a variety of foods for their buffet and they change it up here and there. Their Chicken Tikka Masala is really good. They also give you free naan bread with the buffet. The servers are a little unfriendly but just flag them down and ask for whatever you need and they'll give it to you."}
{"text":"This was a great dinner.  The food is as good as the one in Oakland, but the service was much better. Really, fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've been going to both Pittsburgh-area India Gardens for years. I like the buffet, which is served during lunch hours Mondays through Fridays and all day Sundays.   Food is always tasty, and one can find the standard tikka masala, curry chicken/goat, chole, and paneer.  Of course, you can also find nan, rice, salad and dessert (rice pudding, usually).  Why the two stars, you ask? First, service can be slow and neglectful.  You might not get a drink refill until the end of the meal. (Note: this is not the case at the Monroeville location. They will water you until you drown.)   Second, and this one is important... on my last visit I saw more than one cockroach. One was on the floor near the buffet and another was crawling on my knife.  Now, I grew up around insects (really. don't ask.)  so I didn't freak out.  I just scooted the little bugger off and asked for a new knife.  Many folks would expect a comped meal or at least a drink. I was just surprised when the staff barely reacted when I told them about their little problem. I did, however, get a new knife.    Nevertheless. Pests carry diseases, and not the kind that Wilford Brimley talks about while wearing a sweater-vest. Icky ones.  If you eat here, do a quick scan of the grounds first. I'll amend my rating if they take care of the insect problem. Because frankly, IG is still good eats."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian restaurants I've been to. Great buffet, friendly staff, and fantastic table service.  On Fridays and Sundays, they add a fantastic, spicy goat curry to their buffet line.   Definitely a great option if you're looking for a go-to Indian place in the Goodyear area."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's always good and consistent. Their tea is fantastic too. Pretty much any curry dish will suffice here."}
{"text":"Love the lunch buffet with fresh hot naan brought to your table!  They have a good variety of items on the buffet and it's always busy, so get there early to avoid the rush!  Chicken Tikka Masala, basmati rice, fried vegetable fritters, goat curry, palak paneer, and kheer (rice pudding) are some usual favorites.  The staff is very friendly and is good about refilling your water quickly.    The restaurant is clean and welcoming, but could probably use a makeover.   I haven't tried anything off their regular menu, but I'll be sure to update my review when I do so."}
{"text":"Just A-OK. I tried this place for their Sunday lunch buffet. The choices were rather limited. I lived in India briefly, and I found this place to be too Americanized. Was not truly flavorful.  PROS: clean, good service, plentiful & good chai tea, fresh, naan bread CONS: limited buffet choice  I would recommend to friends, however, it was not truly \"Indian\" enough for me, and I probably will not return."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place.  Usually get the chicken biryani, but recently tried Chicken tika masala which is delicious.  I really don't think you can go wrong with anything tho.."}
{"text":"My wife and I's favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area.  We never pass through without stopping for dinner.  It is an excellent value, and still be a wonderful dining experience at twice price."}
