{"text":"I really like Vietnamese subs, and this place is my favourite. Nice assortment of subs and great real fruit shakes and bubble teas. Friendly staff, free parking (it's in the T&T supermarket / Canadian Tire mall), but pay for your meal with cash only."}
{"text":"DelicIous. 

That is all you need to know. 
I love mom and pop shops.    If you want a tasty treat for $6.99 then you should go here.   Now!"}
{"text":"My good old Dad just dropped one of these subs off for me for lunch -- I have to say, this is the best Vietnamese sub I've had in a LONG time. Every since my favourite sub shop closed down a few years ago, I've been searching for a great vietnamese sub. Finally, I've found one that warrants a great review!

The baguette is slim and crispy, as it should be. The bread is really just the vehicle needed to transport the filling to your mouth. (Although it does play a role in bringing all the flavours together).

I had a beef sate - juicy, thick slices of meat in a nice sate sauce; lots of perfectly pickled carrots; generous cukes, a perfect amount of cilantro, a little bit of something spicy - trust me on this one, it was so good!

(P.S. I just had a vietnamese sub from Thi Thi downtown last week and this one was far better in every way and more. I hadn't been to Thi Thi in a long time -- pretty sure they've changed their recipe.)"}
{"text":"i love viet subs. i hesitated whether i should make it a 4 stars or 5 because its my first viet sub i had in calgary. back at home in toronto, viet sub market is monopolized by ngyuen huong which are extremely delicious, CHEAP (like $2.75 cheap!!) and found everuwhere as they distributes to t&t. banh mi boys which are creative, perfect viet subs for the foodies. express is somewhere in the middle. they make killer milkshakes too!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches, fresh drinks, not bad prices and the people that work there are always smiling which is something I can appreciate. If you're in the area (inside the T&T supermarket food court) definitely worth trying. I would say ask for it extra spicy of you like a little kick."}
