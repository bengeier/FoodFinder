{"text":"Have been going to Mei-Ling for years, so starting a review of a place that feels like home is tough, but since the food here is as good as it gets for Chinese/Szechewan, it deserves one. First off, EAT IN!. The place is small, poorly decorated, but comfy in a weird way. Kitty, the wife of the couple who own Mei-Ling will immediately treat you as ifyou have been there a million times. She knows most people by name, as there is so many regulars, it would be hard to count. OK, the food, because at Mei-Ling its all about that. You must have, in no particular order: - Yet Ca mein noodle soup filled to the brim with chicken pieces, pork pieces, veggies, shrimp and yet ca mein noodles in a steamy, spicy broth that immediately evokes \"the best soup I ever had\" response.. - Calgary crispy ginger beef. THE best you've ever had in a sauce so good an order just of it would be appropriate. - Szechwan chicken..see my photo attached herein - Anhy of the noodle dishes, and ALL of their house specialties. Really the best local take-out Chinese food Ive ever had. When in Aurora, make a point to have lunch at Mei-Ling....and save your money. Most lunch's are $5.00!!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Aurora hands down. Not too salty or overly sauced - perfect flavour and everything is super fresh. No old oil taste. Love it!!!! Bonus - the staff is exceptionally friendly and polite. They truly value their customers and make you want to return for more!"}
{"text":"My go-to Chinese food delivery in Aurora after exploring around. Always fresher and a nice diverse menu when you want to venture off the standards. Friendly service too (even if delivery is a little confused some times)."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout this evening and wasn't impressed. The wonton soup was delicious and yes the veg. Spring rolls crispy, but everything else we ordered was a bust. Dry Shanghai noodles, spongy General Tao Chicken, the Veg. lo mein was super bland. Don't think we'll be ordering from this place again. All in all... wonton soup was delicious but spending close to $75 on crappy takeout is more than frustrating. Still on the hunt for decent Chinese food in North Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Ordered for New Years dinner.  We had to wait 90 minutes to pick up.  The food was inedible, totally tasteless and meat  was tough and chewy.  We will not be returning"}
{"text":"Good food, quick delivery and good prices.  They are very good with substitutions when asked, and if they're too busy to do that they politely let you know.  They have always prepared a good quality product and are VERY accommodating for allergies.  If you like spicy ask for it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to in Aurora. The service is always quick and the food is consistently excellent. I treat myself at least every other week with a meal from this fine establishment. For Chinese food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We truly enjoy the chinese food at this restaurant.  The staff are friendly and efficient.  Great for sit down dinner or take out.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Authentic cuisine and great service. Small and unassuming. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food is very tasty, and take out is very quick. The lady there was very kind and smiling, even late on a weeknight. Very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. I tend to stay away from Asian cuisines other then sushi because of the lack of veggie options ( or if something is veggie, it has a a meat broth in it). But they had a pretty solid amount of choices. The food was prepared very quickly and tasted great! It was really cheap to eat there. It seems like a lot of people do take-out rather then sit-down. I did the take-out there once and is was prepared right on time.   Definitely give this place a try; good food, prices and really quick."}
{"text":"Chinese food reviews are always tough because you have to look from the foodie angle or the casual eater angle  Ok as the casual eater  who is an office worker looking for lunch during the week then this is for you  The usual $8 special offers an egg roll and fried rice with several specials  I chose the General Tao Chicken which is the usual canadian fare and with veggies on the side was very filling amply portioned out  I also added a Hot n Sour soup as thats my test food and it passed  Hmmmmm well as a casual diner the mommy and poppy did a great job with a great meal  is it real chinese food.??..no its canadian style chinese food so be happy to add hot sauce, soy or whatever to spark it up a bit. I have seen way to many people complain about the garlic spare ribs being garlicky...uh yeah its garlic spare ribs  Actually a touch of salt opens the flavours up a bit  many white caucasians will enjoy the fare as its what they can expect when eating out for chinese and the menu is geared towards that group  As a foodie who has no qualms chowing down on pigs ear, rabbit and frog legs alla chinois then you may need to go elsewhere for that kind of stuff!  i have eaten here several times and its always been a better choice than eating in a food court. The owner is nice and she must laugh as i grab the chinese newspaper to read (actually look at the photos) as she brings me a nice meal  if i need to rate the decor then well its cosy and fun and its not the Four Seasons or Nobu but its the right decor for chinese food"}
{"text":"Ate here a few weeks ago. Don't expect anything fancy. Decor's a little old fashioned but the booth seat's quite cozy. Food smells and tastes good. Singapore noodles were not greasy. Service is great. The husband's super nice and knows all the regulars. Took a star off just cause the lunch menu was kinda limited."}
{"text":"Got takeout, beef, chicken, fried rice and soup. All dishes were tasty, nothing bad to say. General Tao chicken was a little dry to my taste, I like more sauce, but my significant other prefers it this way.  The restaurant itself is small and outdated, but it's nice to see how busy they were all evening, food speaks for itself! We will be back for more"}
{"text":"Good food. Tasty. Reliable.  They have saved a few Friday night situations for us.  The owner is friendly and service is prompt."}
{"text":"Shrimp fried rice was the best I've ever tasted!! Good quantity of food and quite tasty. Will likely try Mei Ling again."}
{"text":"The best chinese food that I've found in the Aurora area.  Doesn't blow your socks off but let me know if you can find a better one. I find them fairly friendly and very quick to turn around a takeout order.  I have never dined in there...only takeout. Never had a bad dish so will keep going back!"}
{"text":"Literally the best Chinese food in town. Have been going here for 20 years. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm Chinese, grew up with Chinese cooking and my mother is a very good cook... But this restaurant is pretty good! I love their wing so much! My boyfriend loves coming here and as do I now. The lady at the front is super friendly also!"}
