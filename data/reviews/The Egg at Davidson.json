{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place as we have stopped at the store next door often.  My husband tried an omelette and I had eggs Benedict (which I always like to have when we eat out for breakfast) which I thought had a good hollandaise sauce.  My husband wasn't too excited about his breakfast and we both did not like the coffee.  I can't understand how any restaurant that serves breakfast could skimp on coffee since it should always compliment the food being served.  I would much rather pay a higher price for a good cup of coffee and I'm sure the company providing the coffee has nicer blends cause I've had them other places."}
{"text":"Having lunch at a breakfast place perhaps does not qualify me to write a review, but I am too dedicated to breakfast at Toast to do otherwise.  The food, service, and ambiance are all simple but well done.  I had a tuna salad plate, others in my party had a turkey wrap and quesadillas.   The ingredients all were fresh and the food tasty.  The service was prompt.  The restaurant is located next to Our Town Cinema.  We stopped for a quick lunch before a movie, and it served that purpose quite well."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and it will also be our last, sadly.  I avoid chains and wanted to try somewhere new so we visited on a Friday morning.  There were two waitresses but they obviously needed more staff.  It took several minutes for anyone to greet us and then several more for a waitress to come to our table.  Unfortunately this inattention continued throughout our trip. The restaurant is really comfy, with kitschy decorations absolutely everywhere.  The coffee cups are a mish mash, every one unique.  Unfortunately half the cups on our table were so dirty we wouldn't use them.   I got the Junkyard but couldn't eat 75% of it because there was gelatinous egg white running through the whole dish.  Conversely, my companion's eggs were dry and overcooked."}
{"text":"Stop by the place this morning for some coffee and cute bite to eat while I drop my sister off to swim at the Davison college. The food was okay. I order the egg which with bacon sand which  with home fries. The sandwich was Alright but I had better tasting sand which and their homes-fries was so nasty, tasted like it was over cooked and it was not even hot it came out warm. It seem like they was old homes fries. It didn't even taste fresh.  It was was blend no taste. Not good at all. The service was okay, they kept pushing me for coffee when my cup with halfway full. There were  flies flying around outside during my meal it made me very uncomfortable to  sit  and enjoy my meal and coffee. and my server that took my order came to check on my once after take my order. A different lady came to check on me back forth and brought me my check halfway through my meal telling me no rush. I definitely won't be back. It was not a great experience. The food was not what I expected from the reviews."}
{"text":"Don't show up expecting the hipster scene you find at Toast.  Egg is a modern classic where you can still order liver mush (fried or grilled, I ordered the latter).  I was disappointed they did not have country ham even though it was listed on the menu.  Lots of menu options give you an opportunity to eat breakfast or brunch your way no matter how many generations or diets are represented in your party.  Also handy in case they are out of country ham and you need to call an audible.  My only other complaint comes from the eggs in my dish.  I ordered over-medium, but got something closer to over-easy.  Next time we visit for brunch I will order over-well and update the review.  In typical Davidson fashion you need to show up before 10am to avoid the waiting list.    Check it out and let us know what you think!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff very busy in the morning which is very good cause the food is good as well great place to get a good solid breakfast to start the day."}
{"text":"We were visiting out of town and went to The Egg for breakfast based on the Yelp reviews.  It was a very good, hearty breakfast.  Large portions and decent prices.  Would definitely recommend for a stick to your ribs breakfast"}
{"text":"We've been here on several occasions. Today it was horrible! After waiting almost an hour for our food, watching everyone around us come in, get their food and leave, our food finally arrived. It was horrible. The food was cold and over cooked. The bacon was black, and I'm not sure what was on my plate that they were passing off as country style steak. The eggs and even the home fries were cold. I'm very disappointed and we will never be back again."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. I got the 2x2x2 which is two eggs, two bacon, and two pancakes.  It is very good although the pancakes are almost too good....very rich but great.  Highly recommend checking out The Egg."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review from March 11th, 2017. I've been back to The Egg a couple more times since, and, unfortunately, both times the food has been sub-par. This past Saturday I ordered the Steak and Eggs, with the eggs being sunny-side up. Here's a tip to the kitchen staff, if there is still a transparent, gelatinous goo, the eggs aren't done. Based on my previous review, when I criticized their scrambled eggs, I'm now wondering if The Egg knows how to make eggs. Unfortunately, as much as I want to love The Egg, I cannot. They've quickly become the local breakfast place I go to when I just can't make it to Cafe 100 in Huntersville."}
{"text":"Great. Came here for a very late lunch at 2:35. They close at 3pm. Welcomed in and food came very fast and was perfect.  Coffee was perfect and I am a fussy coffee person. Service and food was great and I will be back again.  Fully recommend this place for the service and food on my visit"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING,it might be even better than IHOP!!!,I usually get 2 Eggs,2 Pancakes,and 2 Sausage Links.They taste OUTSTANDING!!!,Can be crowded on Saturday mornings like most places"}
{"text":"I should have known better than to order the crab Benedict, it's fake crabmeat. The hollandaise was broken and I'm pretty sure it was pre-packaged."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place in Davidson.  Casual and family friendly, good food and very friendly staff.  Our kids love the Mickey Mouse waffles.  Reasonably priced and good for breakfast."}
{"text":"Terrible experience for breakfast this morning. I ordered the breakfast special and when the pancake came it was literally still oozing with uncooked batter. The bacon was just barely cooked enough and my scrambled egg was way overcooked. They offered to give me another pancake but it took so long that my egg was cold so I ate as much as I could of the first pancake. The waitress never came by and offered to refill my coffee and never made an attempt at apologizing for the breakfast. After leaving I called in an attempt to speak to the owner but, unfortunately, he was the one cooking and I was told I couldn't speak to him until the afternoon. I like to patronize local establishments however I will not be able to return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"We ate here after a visit to the Davidson Farmers Market on Saturday morning. Although it was crowded, we were sat immediately.   Ambience was a typical family diner with some old-school flair.  Freshly squeezed orange juice was awesome! I ordered the sausage biscuits with gravy topped with scrambled eggs and a side of bacon. I've never had eggs on my sausage gravy and biscuits; it was interesting but a bit too much food touching.  My wife ordered the junkyard, a skillet filled with eggs, meat, cheese and anything you can think of adding.  The food was good and cheap. I'm sure it would be a solid hangover cure."}
{"text":"Pros: cheap,quick and a lot of choices. Great coffee too!  Cons: taste like processed food. Greasy. Rude waitstaff."}
{"text":"I had the Chicken Philly, wasn't bad, wasn't great. Sweet tea was exactly how I like it, not too sweet, just enough. Buddy had the Fiesta Bene, he really enjoyed it.  Service was friendly, place was clean, toilet was clean, price was cheap; I will return."}
{"text":"If you go for nothing else, the wait staff here will make your day. The food can be so so at times, but the whole experience definitely makes up for it. The egg and corned beef are my favorite. Sidenote: Fantastic hangover recovery location."}
{"text":"Wife loves this place. It was my first time and brought my son.   Mickey pancakes were a hit.   My spinach omelette was bitter. I've never had spinach prepared that way. They forgot my bacon and when they brought It out it appeared to have been microwaved.  The grits were above average.   The men's toilet was nasty which is a major problem for a restaurant IMO.   I'll give it another try but def won't order the same dish."}
{"text":"Large portions.  Perfectly seasoned Hashbrowns served in a skillet.  Easy on the wallet and you can eat breakfast here after 9 a.m. unlike most other places.  Plus, I like Davidson so we drive from Concord to get a great breakfast and not spend a fortune."}
{"text":"This place is great! Awesome food and great service! The Junkyard is fantastic a must try! Everything is a great price and they are very quick! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Found a new gem for breakfast! Fantastic fresh ingredients, made to order, delivered hot to table. Staff courteous and attentive. Eggs Benedict Florentine was out of this world, from fresh spinach to handmade hollandaise sauce, with eggs to perfection. Coffee abundant and delicious. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Terrible ! The poached eggs on the Benedict were so overcooked that they were hard boiled.  The hollandaise had a lot of sugar and was thick and cold.  The pancakes had less flavor than a box of instant mix from the grocery store... AWFUL.  Overpriced...Go to Toast up the street for an excellent breakfast."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in the area! The staff is good and pleasant. Bonnie is the best waitress I've known."}
{"text":"Varied menu. Pleasant staff. Clean. Not noisy, so conversation could be heard. Large servings and food was very tasteful, in a delicious way. Would prefer homemade bread, but realize the expense and time involved. Bacon was crispy, eggs seemed fresh, and home fries cooked somewhat crispy and brown, to my liking. Meal was served in about 10 minutes! Speedy! The bad unfortunately was the coffee, which seemed weak and not very tasteful.  I will go back, and hopefully the coffee will improve."}
{"text":"The waiters were very nice and made sure that our orders were exactly what we ordered. One order had one less egg then we asked and they noticed before we did and made sure to get it fixed! They even give you a discount for the next time you come back after 3!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have breakfast here and needless to say I didn't find it to be the best choice on  this occasion. I ordered the corned beef hash and potatoes and over medium eggs. The eggs were  really runny . Also the service was not the best and the place is not very diverse if that's what you're looking for. This was a second visit and not to knock it because the first visit was fine I just would not recommend going back there a third time."}
{"text":"You can pay more at a fancy restaurant but it does not get any better than the eggs Benedict here at The Egg at Davidson NC. Ms. B and the owner are pretty much the cooks here and they deserve a Nod Nod and smile for their Delicious fare.  Will be back to try some of their other good eats.  Service and friendly staff are a pleasure to be around and that bottomless cup of Joe with a friendly smile will make you want to come back.  It is a long way from Cleveland OH where I live but when I am in the area you will find me here a couple times a week."}
{"text":"Good breakfast & great service from Tabitha! Will definitely go again. Comfortable and homey feeling,  nothing over the top. Just what my husband and I were looking for,  simple and quaint. Love it!"}
{"text":"Big Improvement from past experiences.  I've eaten at The Egg a number of times over the years and for the most part, have never been thrilled with the service. I'm going to guess that most of the servers are students trying to pick up a few bucks and are not really all that motivated.  Something has changed and changed for the better.  After Church today, I decided to give The Egg another shot and I'm glad I did. They were crowded when I walked in but was seated immediately.  My server came with a menu very shortly thereafter and needless to say, I order Coffee and when she came back I ordered the Crab Benedict with Hash browns..  Service was good from the kitchen and I had my order in just over 10 minutes. Food in the past has been good but not outstanding.  Today it was outstanding.and made for a great breakfast and the portions were large.  Don't know what has happened but the staff appears to be better trained, more motivated and engaged and an honest attempt to meet the customer's needs. I glanced over the dining room and at various times when the server had a brief lull while waiting for an order, they would actually engage the customers in small talk which is a nice touch.  Very pleasant experience time and let's home it continues."}
{"text":"Love this place what a hidden gem.  My husband and I went there for the 1st time this week and we had Dorene has our waiters she is awesome and was very friendly and attentive to our needs.  The food was very good.. love a place with Good food and good service.  Will be  going back."}
{"text":"We eat frequently here but after today, will know better than to go during icy/snowy weather.  No effort was made to clear away any of the ice in the handicapped parking spaces. It is difficult enough to walk in snow but with ice added, it was impossible to even get out of car today.  Very disappointed. No salt or sand was even put down to help."}
{"text":"A good solid breakfast place.   Just to set expectations - nothing fancy but prepared with care, served quickly and friendly staff.   Typical breakfast fare of eggs, pancakes, etc.  they do have some lunch selections such as sandwiches and salads.   Definitely recommend this small business to someone that is looking for a nice meal."}
{"text":"What a treasure Davidson has in The Egg.  My daughter kidnapped me for a Sunday brunch and I'm so glad she did.    The service was as friendly and helpful as it gets.   They have the typical breakfast menu with generous portions.   The corned beef hash was great as was the house potatoes with cheese and onions on top.     I will be back."}
{"text":"The Egg vs. Toast - Which is the breakfast joint to eat?  That is the question.    By the looks of the reviews on Toast, Toast is consistently good.  Toast is just awesome, with better prepared and quality food.  By the looks of the reviews on The Egg, it is all over the place, some hate it, some love it.  People it boils down to expectations.  If you want to go to a social hang out and drop $35 for a breakfast of two, Toast is the answer.  You will wait 30 minutes, but be rewarded with excellent food, service and a very chic social environment.  On the other hand, if you want a down and dirty $15 breakfast that is pretty darn good, I would go to The Egg.  Personally, I prefer The Egg, just my style.    Plus, I am a egg, cheese and livermush guy.  They serve a killer livermush.   The service was quick and friendly.   We were there from 9 to 10 am on a Saturday and traffic was high, turnover fast, the place was hopping."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast joint.  Go for the pancakes (huge) side of the menu.  Or omelette.  One disappointing note:  Feeling adventuresome, I went for the eggs-onion-hash brown scrambled thing (called a \"mishmash\" or something like that), but the cheese (swiss cheese) was simply two slices from the grocery store put on top.  The rest of the dish was fine, but please mix it in.    The advantages of the Egg are -- solid breakfast, easy parking, and busy (so the food is good), but finding a free table isn't a problem.  When weather permits lots of tables outside too.  Wait staff is very good."}
{"text":"I've never had a good experience here. Today I was asked to go with a friend (I would never suggest eating here) and relented. They got my order completely wrong-- not even close. I waited for my spinach omelet, as my four friends ate (I insisted). What arrived, quickly, was scrambled eggs with spinach-- literally SCRAMBLED. I didn't want to make a fuss so just ate it.  Now, 2 hours later, I am sick to my stomach. Never again!"}
{"text":"The Egg is a good place to get a basic breakfast at a cheap price.  My husband and I venture into The Egg every few weeks for breakfasts.  Lots of families eat here and are welcomed.  I don't have a favorite item on the menu, but our meals are always pretty solid.  We always have great and attentive service.   Unfortunately, their coffee is terrible."}
{"text":"I'm sure during really busy times any place gets crazy, so I take some of the reviews on here with a grain of salt. I came here for lunch, 12:15-12:45pm, today is Tuesday. My omelet was perfect, they threw seasoned salt on my hash browns which I love. The service can be described in two words, southern hospitality. My only complaint if I could have one is the decor is not my style. But compared to some of the better looking brunch places in davidson the service is miles ahead. Love this place. If they let me redecorate it I'll give it five stars ;)"}
{"text":"It can't compare with Toast and anyone who tries to compare the two would be a fool. One is haute couture and one is retro fab. That said, the menu has a solid variety, the eggs are always cooked right, the hash is very lean, the crab bene is delic and the toast is crispy, hot & buttered. My son adores the Mickey Mouse pancakes and we appreciate the great service in the comfortable, easy going, neighborhood atmosphere. This is quickly becoming a Sunday favorite for us."}
{"text":"I love The Egg. Friendly, attentive staff, great coffee, tasty food at a very reasonable price. My go to is the western omelet with no cheese, add spinach, with a fruit cup and wheat toast. The toast is buttered and well done. Can't say enough good things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is mostly on the waitstaff, awful. We walked in and approximately 4 employees standing at the counter, awkwardness ensues. The food was ok. We were seated by the window with the unused door, choking on gas fumes and grass clippings from the maintenance people outside. We left. At that point the waitress never came back till she said \"anything else\""}
{"text":"Love to buy breakfast it was exactly what I wanted the eggs were perfectly done my bacon was super crispy. Service was quick and pleasant"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Get the Junkyard... it's everything. Eggs and hashbrowns then you get to choose what else you want to put in it. Bacon, ham, sausage, cheeses, peppers, onions, mushrooms, gravy, tomatoes. It was delish!  Also, the biscuits were just okay. I would go for rye toast the next time."}
{"text":"Country.  Fried.  Steak.  Know these three words and know them well.  For $8, you get 5.5oz of delicious country fried steak, home-fries (delicious potato chunks), four slices of your bread of choice, a generous cup of gravy, and a two eggs cooked to your preferences!  For those used to IHOP, this beats it in every single way (Price, Taste, Service.)  My classmate got some egg-sandwich thing that I frankly did not notice because I was shoveling food into my face at a dangerous pace.  I think she liked it and I would have asked her if my mouth wasn't full of country fried steak!!  First off, the steak is wonderfully soft.  It's not oily and it's not overly salty.  The fries are also absolutely wonderful and I paid an extra dollar to have chopped onions and a piece of American cheese slapped on top.  I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The portions are perfect, the price is perfect, and the place was clean, spacious, and cutely decorated.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  I especially liked how much gravy they gave me so I could dip my bread and stuff into it also.  It's not sophisticated food but it was an excellent value.  It will also probably give you a heart attack but that's why they make Lipitor and Crestor, right ;-)?"}
{"text":"Okay, but I've had better for less money. Ask them to over cook the hash browns, they didn't."}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast spot! Can't believe this was my first time. Food was relish and service was perfect! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. The location is right next door to the Our Town Cinemas in Davidson.... its in a small shopping center, but big inside. The staff was really nice and the food was great!  I ordered the skillet platter with eggs, onions, peppers, tomatoes, sausage, and bacon. You can add all ingredients without the extra charge. They have ham that you can add as well. The size portion was huge! Under all the ingredients were potatoes cubes seasoned to perfection. My spouse ordered the Neptune. This huge omelette had warm, small,  chopped, crabmeat with cheese and onions. We also got the pancakes. The pancakes were fluffy and everything is homemade! We order a lot to try on our first time at places. I like how the plate was presented so the toast was not wet, but full of butter."}
{"text":"Last meal visiting from Bay Area.  Too bad.  Service: nice and friendly.  Food: ick.  American cheese on omelette.  Omelette overcooked and bland.  Home fries terrible: undercooked and no seasoning.  They were bland cubes of barely cooked potatoes.  Coffee mediocre.  In my opinion, breakfast food not so hard to kick ass, but so many places are lazy and fail.  This is yet another."}
{"text":"I feel like the Egg at Davidson might be a little underwhelming to look at but walk in and give this place a chance.  Don't expect anything fancy... rather you will find some great service and people you can call friends.  The coffee is decent and the food is good... the price? Exactly what you would expect from a typical sit down diner type. Affordable.  I always get the crab benedict... Is the crab real?  I have not one clue.  It is good and tastes like I would expect  The hollandaise is a little scrambled but the flavor is delicious.  The egg is poached to ridiculous perfection each and every time.  Cuts every so perfect so the yolk can run out all over the rest of the meal... Just my imaginary British grandmother used to make.  Bc for some reason, I feel that Brits can poach eggs better than Americans.  The servers will bend over backward to make sure that you are reasonably accommodated and it is a small enough place that anyone will take care of you... and remember you.  I was reminded of that today when I went for the first time in months and everyone remembered exactly who I was.  Rarely do the servers or kitchen make mistakes but if they do, these are the type you can just let them know how it is and they will gladly fix it for you.  Go here for something extremely decent, great price and even better people to serve you."}
{"text":"We originally wanted to go to the Toast but came here after seeing so many people waiting outside of the Toast. Surprisingly, food was no different than the Toast but better atmosphere here... More brighter and clean :)"}
{"text":"Maybe I am just too particular, but I was totally unimpressed with this place.  For starters, the coffee was just awful...it was very weak.  And the ham and cheese scramble didn't even have the cheese mixed in - it was served with a semi-melted slice of american cheese on top of the eggs. The dish would have been so much better had they actually tried to make it look (and taste) more appealing!  On a positive note, it's easy to get a seat here on busy days, and service is friendly and efficient.  I just can't imagine ever wanting to return with bad coffee and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Somehow, I have ended up eating at The Egg on multiple occasions now. Each time, I wonder to myself why. The food is mediocre and extremely poorly presented. The service is well intentioned but generally incompetent. If you're looking for a brunch place, you should definitely consider any alternatives before coming here. It's as expensive as Toast but much less enjoyable."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and lunch! I enjoy all of the food but today I had the Carolina burger and it was awesome!!! I was suprised  their burgers are so good. Would highly recommend !! The employees are very nice and provide great service."}
{"text":"It's inexpensive.  That's about the best that you can say about The Egg.  The food is truly mediocre.  This is not the place you want to go for breakfast food in Davidson.  (However, I will admit that the service has been great when I have been here - the people seem to be really, really nice.  I just wish that the food were decent....)"}
{"text":"Counrty fried steak and eggs, b&g, and hash browns (I asked them to over cook them but they didn't. That seems to be the theme here) were all pretty good!"}
{"text":"I visit my son in Cornelius every now and then I love to eat here the best breakfast ever I have to visit here every time I visit now   Very kind people always get exactly what I order and very delicious"}
{"text":"Do you remember when you go on vacation and pop into some divey joint that the locals frequent and think to yourself, I wish we had a spot like XYZ back home?  Well, we do have one!  The Egg is in the same strip shopping center as the Davidson movie theater and the Home Economist (I can never remember what they changed their name to). It's the kind of place you want a breakfast place to be... formica tables, seat yourself, wave to a vaguely familiar face or two as you wind your way over to your seat.  I like the consistency of the staff, it's always the same faces when I go in there.  They're not super gushy friendly, I wouldn't mind a Honey, now and again, but it's ok, I like to see their familiar faces each visit.  The food is what you'd expect, diner-ish: straightforward breakfast and lunch items.  Not super tasty, not bad, just exactly what you'd expect from a place called The Egg.  My husband loves their food, I'm not a super-fan, but I like the local folk vibe and if you don't time a visit to Toast well then you can usually get a spot over here and what do you want in the morning?  A seat and breakfast, not a wait time.   BTW, Davidson has Toast, Davidson has The Egg, now all we need is a place called Bacon. :)"}
{"text":"Must say, not my favorite but won't rule it out. Went after church hoping to get lunch but only breakfast served on Sun. I am not a big breakfast lover. I had egg, bacon, cheese sandwich. My bread was hard around edges from over toasting. My husband had the western omelette and liked very much. I am Southern and ordered grits and they were cooked perfectly.  They were very busy so took awhile to get our order but the service was excellent except for that. I will go back and try lunch sometime."}
{"text":"We have been searching for a decent breakfast place in cornelius, davidson or huntersville-continually dissapointed. Had heard EGG was SO SO but finally tried it and we all really enjoyed it. Food was fresh, unique and flavorful. We will be back frequently"}
{"text":"Ate for the first time at the Egg Cafe. Found the food to be very good, service was excellent and prices are good.  No longer going to Toast Cafe."}
{"text":"Went there for a  late morning meal on August 21, 2014.  Two waitresses were very inattentive and we walked out. And what's truly bad is that they watched as we left. No attempt to correct the situation, nada.   We've been there three times before because my daughter is a student at Davidson College. All three times the waitress was unexcited and going through the motions. We have always tipped well, hoping they would be more welcoming the next time -  Not!!!!  Today  is the last straw.   Yesterday, I ordered their \"homemade\" corn beef hash and I couldn't finish it due to the vinegar taste it had.     Seriously, I got friendlier service in North Jersey.         Maybe they are more welcoming to regulars.     In my opinion this is absentee ownership at work, or a tired, apathetic owner who doesn't care about his restaurant.      \"If one customer  leaves happy, he brings in ten more; but if you make one customer unhappy, he drives away 100\" Dale Carnegie, How to win Friends  and Influence People. Every business owner, no matter what he or she does, should read the book; I paid 50 cents at the flea market."}
{"text":"I called in an order to The Egg recently, on a Saturday morning. The waitress on the phone said my order (egg sandwich with hash browns) would be ready in 15 minutes. When I showed up however, the server at the counter said she couldn't find my order. The kitchen never received it; nobody even remembered taking a call (or so they claimed). The server even suggested that perhaps I had called the wrong restaurant(!!!).  I then asked to speak to a manager. The server went back to the kitchen, then returned promptly saying \"the manager was too busy to talk\". She then asked if I would still like to place an order. I asked if there would be any discount for the inconvenience. She said the manager could probably do a \"small discount\".  I told her that seemed a rather shabby offer, being that the restaurant was in the wrong; THEY had lost MY order, and by this time I was late to work. Young Miss Thing then replied that SHE didn't lose my order.  I was so angry by this point that I left with no breakfast, never to return again.  In all the years I have worked in customer service (beginning probably before young Miss Thing was even born), I have never treated a customer as appallingly as I was treated at The Egg. Telling a customer \"it's wasn't ME who lost your order\" is not only unhelpful, but it is tantamount to saying \"Well that's not MY problem\".  I have a news flash for young Miss Thing (and her slacker manager). Rule number 1 of Customer Service: when a business makes a mistake, it is EVERYONE'S job to correct the error, no matter where it originated. That is because in a customer's eyes, it doesn't matter whose personal error it was; all that matters is there is clearly a problem, but it is certainly NOT the customer's problem.  I think it's fairly obvious what happened. Someone took my phone order, then forgot to turn it into the kitchen. (This happens from time-to-time: ok, it's understandable. Whoever the forgetful culprit was, however, obviously didn't want to admit it, for fear of getting in trouble. Lying: NEVER ok.)  I understand that Saturday mornings are hectic in restaurants; I worked in the restaurant business for years. But if Mr. Fancy Pants manager/owner is so busy that he can't even take 15 seconds to satisfy an (understandably) upset customer, perhaps he should find a different, easier, slower paced line of business.  Even if he really was so genuinely slammed busy that he was not able to tear himself away from whatever arduous task, sending a smart-mouthed teenage kid out to apologise with a measly \"small discount\" was CERTAINLY not the right answer.   Here's a suggestion for Mr. Fancy Pants & young Miss Thing for next time: a scrambled egg takes approximately 30 seconds to cook, and costs less than 30¢, as does a pile of greasy potatoes. If this scenario ever rises again, simply make the poor customer an egg sandwich, free of charge, and send her on her merry way. Wouldn't that be better than all this hassle & bad reviews?   *and for all the inquiring minds out there, I was so ruffled upon leaving that I even pressed \"redial\" on my cellphone as I stormed out to my car, to make sure I HADN'T actually dialed the wrong number. And who should answer it of course? None other than young Miss Thing."}
{"text":"We've been going up to Davidson every Saturday morning for the farmers market and have already checked out Toast for breakfast. So when I saw The Egg also had a Groupon-esque deal I quickly snagged it up and decided we would go one day before hitting up the farmers market. Today was that day.  The Egg is not as \"conveniently\" located as Toast is, in that it's not in the quaint, cute little part of Davidson. It's about a two minute drive away from that section in a strip mall, but that actually ends up being a perk. When we went to Toast we found a bustling, tight and dark breakfast joint. The Egg is the opposite...there were plenty of open tables while we were there (from 9-10am), the tables were spaced out nicely and it was a bright, laid-back place. We were sat immediately and our waitress introduced herself and got our drink orders less than a minute after we sat down. Once we placed our order, our meals arrived in less than ten minutes. It was ridiculously quick!  I ordered the Tennessee \"Benne\" ($8.95) which consisted of a split English muffin base (though I substituted for a biscuit...no extra charge) topped with sausage patties, two poached eggs and smothered in sausage gravy. The eggs were cooked well and the sausage and sausage gravy gave a nice peppery spice to the dish. The sausage gravy itself was pretty good, but I found the sausage gravy at Toast to be slightly better. The biscuit was perfect...warm and fresh, light and buttery...pure bliss. I went with homefries for a side and these little taters were perfect! Definitely the perfect side to add to my sausage gravy dish.  The miss' ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine ($8.95) which contained English muffin (she also subbed in the biscuit), two poached eggs and spinach that is doused in Hollandaise sauce and dusted with paprika. She loved her dish everything was cooked spot on. I snagged a forkful of some egg and Hollandaise and it was pretty darn tasty. She opted for the tomato slices as a side and said it complimented the overall dish very well (I wouldn't know...I'm not a fan of raw tomato or any kind of spinach.)   If you're in Davidson looking for a breakfast joint, I would definitely recommend checking out The Egg. I believe that Toast gets more attention and love, but the food at both places is pretty much equal. The thing that The Egg has over Toast is the location. By not being in that bustling section of town you will have a more peaceful breakfast...it's not as busy, not as loud, no waiting for a table and a bit more personal space are all perks over going to Toast."}
{"text":"The food is very below average. Potatoes taste like crap. Food is either under cooked or over cooked. Staff look miserable. Not where I want to be spending my days off. Horrible experience. Plenty of better and cheaper options in the area."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. The food was good and our waitress Tabitha was very personable. We will come back when in this area of town."}
