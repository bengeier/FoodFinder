{"text":"Lunch buffet for $10 is a good deal. However, the rice was really disgusting. I have never had rice with such a disgusting aroma. I don't know what they could have possibly put in it to create such a stench. I tried both types of rice they had, and they are both just as nasty. The curries had what I referred to my friends as \"debris\" in them. Big chunks of spices and small pieces of chicken bones were everywhere in the food. Professional cooks preparing food for patrons shouldn't be this amateur and have chunks of non-edibles loose throughout their dishes. The butter chicken is sub-par. Everything else is mediocre at best.  Other than these misdemeanors, the staff were great and the setting delightful. The deserts were delicious, especially the goopy flan-type thing. Overall, not bad for $10 but stay far away from the rice."}
{"text":"My fianc√©e and I decided to stay in and order some India food...sounds like a nice night, doesn't it? Sadly it hasn't quite turned out that way.  Googlemap says we live 1.7 km away and it should take about 7 minutes without traffic (given it's snowed a lot today and the roads aren't the greatest so we expected some delays). We ordered at 5:40pm, expected time of delivery 6:40 pm,  it is currently 8:45 pm and we still haven't received anything.  We've called twice and have been poorly reassured that our \"food is on the way\"...I will never order from this place again and will highly advise my friends to stay away.   There are a ton of awesome reliable indian restaurants,  go with them."}
{"text":"We went today for the $10 buffet lunch (offered seven days a week) which was great value for the price. There were about 15 different food options to choose from including dessert. The naan, goat and tandoori chicken were particularly good.   Everything tasted awesome while we were having it, but shortly thereafter I found myself extremely parched. I have a MSG sensitivity and extreme thirst after eating typically signals to me that MSG was added. This was confirmed the next morning when I woke up with a massive headache.   Our server was very attentive and the restaurant had a nice ambiance with the floor to ceiling windows overlooking the street, but they really need to can the MSG."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurent, amazing veiw, nice sitting area,  i had hariyali chicken and chicken tikka which was one of the best chicken tikka i have ever had. Its a good restaurent to go with family and if you have a date don't forget to take a window seat."}
{"text":"I like the food and the service.  Everything tasted really good. My only complain is that the food was spicy even though I ordered it mild."}
{"text":"Ordered from here last night. It wasn't bad, wasn't great either--seemed pretty clearly like second tier Indian. Go check out Barbur on queen west."}
{"text":"I didn't have the option of no 'stars' because I believe even one star is too much for the restaurant. The entrance has a strong sickening smell, like urine.  The food at the lunch buffet was putrid. The rice had been heated for so long it was like chewing stones. The so-called tandoori chicken had no flavour and tasted stale; had probably been there for days. Every dish was below standard. Even the yogurt had been diluted with water to an extent that it had lost all it's flavour. I am keeping my fingers crossed for food poisoning.  I had informed the waiter when I entered that I had a voucher bought on Buytopia, yet he tried to cheat me by not deducting the full value of the voucher and corrected it after a lot of convincing.  Finally when I went to the washroom to wash my hands I noticed that one of the restaurant staff, either a waiter or a chef walked straight out after urinating without washing his hands. So good luck guys and gals if you are contemplating a visit."}
{"text":"The Spice Village is right across from the Wellesley Subway so its easy to get to, if you drive there is a Green P parking literally beside the restaurant.   This is a pleasant restaurant, with friendly servers. they have a whole wall of windows so in the day time it is bright and cheery. We had the lunch special - 2 items for $9 a great price. So with 2 people you both order 2 dishes and share and the naans are included. Great food for a cheap price. I recommend them."}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with the service.  Through a mixup with a groupon, we charged tax twice on our meal.  Our server refused to discuss this with us and insisted that we pay 20% tax.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is right outside of my window, so every time I look out I get reminded to try the $10 lunch buffet. Today I finally did and it was everything I expected for $10 - no more, no less.   The atmosphere was quite desolate - at 1430 on a Sunday afternoon only 3 other pairs of people shared the dining area with me. Apart from not being seated as I came up the stairs, the service was great from the older gentleman who didn't speak much English.   There were four trays of curries and I must say the lamb was great. Overall really greasy but I don't have Indian food frequently so I can't compare it to anything. Rice was spiced with cumin seeds (I'm a sucker for cumin) but they were sitting in the tray for a while because many grains were hard and stale. The salads left much to desire after having the savory mains. There was rice pudding and gulab jamun for desert, which were respectively nicely sweet and really freaking sweet.   Really can't go wrong for $13 tax and tip in, but I don't think I will be a weekly customer. I just know where to go next time I want some cheap greasy curry."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Really enjoyed it.   Food: We ordered veggie samosas as the appetizer (it was yummy).  We ordered the chicken biryani which was awesome (the spices and veggies in the rice was just spectacular! The Baingan Patiala was a creamy eggplant and potato dish and it was very delicious. We also ordered the Bengali Gobi Masala, which was a cauliflower dish in a tomato based sauce....Nothing special about that one. Pretty average.   Spice: We ordered medium spice on everything and it was perfectly spicy for our American tastes. If you don't like spice, get mild. If you don't mind spice, get medium.   Atmosphere: We came late in the night so it was less crowded. It has nice large windows with a great view of the street.   Hospitality: The waiter was trying to clean up (at the end of the night), so we had to ask a lot to get things like water. (Ended up asking to keep the pitcher on the table).   We each got a little sample of the mango lassi on the house at the end of the night, which was very delicious and thoughtful!   Overall: Delicious food, nothing spectacular, and nothing fancy, but would recommend to a friend :-)"}
{"text":"Having been here for the buffet when it was run under a different name (Biryani House, I believe), I wanted to return to get my fill of a variety of Indian dishes. At 10 bucks for a lunch buffet, this cannot be beat.  Slightly odd to have only a few other tables busy at 2pm but it had everything I would want for a satisfying meal on a cold and rainy spring day- perhaps that's why it was not busy. Not only did it boast a variety of curries (butter chicken, channa/chickpea curry, dahl, and what I think was either goat or lamb in sauce), but it also had the accompanying sides that help round out a meal (pakoras, raita/yoghurt with mint, cucumbers, and carrots, as well as safron rice and naan bread). My only (slight) complaint would be that the goat/lamb sauce was a bit greasy and the meat was difficult to eat off bones with skin, though this is perhaps hard to avoid.  I appreciated that the items were not swimming in pools of grease, as can happen at buffets.  I also would have enjoyed garlic naan or something more upscale but perhaps that is for purchase or special request? I am unsure of whether the management/owner has changed, or if it is the name only. This location is great - try to sit by the window and watch the world go by. Linger after the meal for a few minutes with a glass of water. This place is worth a visit, not because it has sixty buffet items (because it doesn't) but because everything in the buffet was fresh, which is what is difficult to deliver in a buffet setting."}
{"text":"Awesome food. A la carte - Ordered Veg Jalfrezi and Simply Okra, with garlic Naan.. Absolutely yummy, fresh. QUALITY INDIAN FOOD."}
{"text":"It has taken 1 hour and 40 minutes, and they still have not delivered our food. The store manager blatantly lies that the delivery guy is a minute away. They have absolutely zero sympathy towards the customer.  I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"They've cleaned up the place a little since the last time I was here.  It's a big giant space that I haven't seen filled up for lunch service.  They offer a small but inexpensive ($10.99) AYCE lunch buffet.  But you get the classics.  Couple of salads, naan, butter chicken, curried goat, etc.  Not going to remind you of India anytime soon.  But probably one of the better value places you're going to get in the neighbourhood.  Worth checking out."}
{"text":"The garlic naan is amazing. I tried the butter chicken and the chicken karahi, both of which were pretty good. As another yelper had mentioned, they are pretty stingy with the chicken in the dishes and this is the reason for my 3 star rating. I am going to try their lunch buffet, to see if it's as good as Indian hut on church st., which is a couple blocks away."}
{"text":"The place is clean, with tasty food and friendly server. I love the butter chicken here. For 10$ buffet, this is a good deal. The only thing I don't like is the dessert, nothing special about it."}
{"text":"We just ordered butter chicken from here. Never again! The meat was completely disgusting!  It was definitely not chicken breast and I'm not even sure it was dark chicken meat. Terrible meal."}
{"text":"I will never go back. The smell when you walk in, is not of Indian food. It smells like a sewer backed up. Funny, I was visiting a friend who lives in the building that it's attached to, and I noticed a horrible stench in the lobby. It went on for 2 weeks. Upon investigating, it was The Spice Village. They had a kitchen flood that they were rather remiss on fixing. Many complaints were made and they took no urgency over the situation. The smell was horrid.   The garbage in the back of the restaurant is disgusting. I took pictures, and will contact the city. It's over spilling with the most vile contents. They refuse garbage pick up every week, like they're supposed to, and opt for every 2 weeks. The smell is just awful.   The food is ok. But that's irrelevant. The restaurant is clearly dirty and filthy, and they would rather go about things as cheaply as they can. That disgusts me as a patron. I'm around that restaurant frequently, walk by it everyday, and it's a disgrace. They obviously don't care about following the health code in this city.   Will never go back."}
{"text":"The food was cold by the time that it arrived (which was later than promised), the dishes were stingy on the meat, and the butter chicken sauce was really watery.  Also, the total that we were given on the telephone was less than what the driver asked for, so we annoyingly had to dig around for change."}
{"text":"This restaurant is consistently excellent. My boyfriend and I very rarely go back to restaurants since there are so many stand-out restaurants in Toronto, but we find our way back to the Spice Village at least once or twice a month.  The service is impeccable. The owner always takes the time to greet us and the servers are friendly and attentive.   The quality of the food is outstanding. The butter chicken and garlic naan are flawless - easily the best that I have had in Canada. Other standout dishes include the saag paneer, the 'simply okra', the Bengal special daal (both the black and yellow are addictive and you need to try both) and the tandoori shrimp melt in your mouth. I could probably eat two orders of garlic naan to myself, just so that I have plenty to mop up the incredible butter chicken sauce.  We have taken friends and family to this restaurant and everyone loves it. Someone needs to do a feature on this restaurant because people who judge this place on the restaurant's exterior are missing out on some of the best Indian food and service in the city. It's also directly across from Wellesley Station, so it could not be easier to get to."}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was called Biryani House. The problem that they had then seems to be the same problem they still have. Cleanliness and consistency.  When the kitchen gets it right I recommend the chicken tikka  masala or the lamb shank because they are delicious here. However it was so hit or miss before the name change and based on the yelp reviews it's still the same."}
{"text":"Decent Bengali-style Indian restaurant (compared to the more common Punjabi in Toronto). Naan was more flavourful than usual, with what appeared to contain more than just white flour. A decent option."}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was called the biriyani house. This is my first time back here since the name was changed. I sat down about 15-20 maybe more minutes ago... After standing at the top of the stairs for about another ten fifteen minutes. I am now being served water, finally, and they have announced it's going to be another 10 minutes for the real food. (Update, it was another 20ish)  Turn off the freaking open sign if you are not open. Open sign \"on\" = open. I checked the hours prior to coming and the hours start at 11... Not 12. I will update with the food, maybe this situation will rectify itself and if I don't pass out from hypoglycaemia.  Update: I braved the stares from staff who all knew I was quite upset. By the way staff, it's unacceptable to whisper if a customer was served water and when the answer is no, to tell the staff to bring said water and take care of the customer when the staff delays the process (I think that happened twice to me, before anyone came by). Food was okay, no spinach with paneer (boo), they had tofu with butter chicken sauce (ok but why not paneer?) and a smaller than before array of items, no fruit or papadums. In my hunger (and having the trembles because I had taken meds that I take before meals) I picked out what I didn't know was a raw onion salad, but, with the very dry chicken tikka it actually made it better. Dahl makhni was kind of bland but okay. The goat curry was rubbery. The pakoras were good. Gulab jamun was spongy and didn't gush with the syrup like the good kinda do. The kheer was good though. Overall, I was severely disappointed especially since I thought \"fresh\" food would be worth it a bit more. This meal was akin to waiting a severely long time to prepare the ready made boxed equivalents from lonlaws. Obviously, it was not at all worth the wait or my 11 bucks. The server did try to apologize at the end while I was coincidently at the tip prompt when I was paying, but I think that that was a little too late and shamefully obvious. I think I'm going to meander father down yonge next time to the other places I know I can count on."}
{"text":"Never again. Whoever wrote that he ate \"the best butter chicken in Canada\" must have never ate chicken in his life.  I ordered butter chicken from this restaurant and I have no idea what that was. Definitely not a chicken. All I can think of now is what sound did that creature make before they put it in my meal: chirp, miau, woof or maybe \"hello\" oO."}
