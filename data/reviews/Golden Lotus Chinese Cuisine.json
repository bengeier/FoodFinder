{"text":"I must say that I am surprisingly impressed.  Located in the Fortinos plaza, its a small take out joint that can easily be missed.     I passed it many times..and then finally gave it a try last night and ordered take out.  We got the chicken fried rice (was good but not totally fried rice), shrimp with fresh veggies (yummy and flavourful) and szechuan chicken ( very yummy) as well!   Price was pretty reasonable so will definitely order from here again! Not many choices for Chinese food in Woodbridge, but this is definitely going to be my new go to."}
{"text":"the food is alright considering this is Vaughan home of the best Italian eateries....Chinese takeout is tough to come by...   Its pretty good but when ordering make them repeat the order and when they deliver check your order before paying... twice I was shorted... paid and missing part of my order.    they claim I have a 6 dollar credit... like I can collect...  So not bad food... just check your order..."}
{"text":"This little gem has been in my neighbourhood for years! Whenever I don't have time to cook, I turn to Golden Lotus for their delicious food. The menu consists of typical Americanized Chinese food, which is nevertheless flavourful and skilfully made. My favourite menu items are chicken balls and their selection of soups. Service is always friendly and fast. Food is usually ready in less than 15 minutes."}

Their combination Combos are a great deal!  We had the Dinner for Three (26.75) and it fed FIVE people! Their portions are HUGE."}
