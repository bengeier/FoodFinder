{"text":"amazing food and quick service! Love the ribs and rice. The spring rolls are mediocre, but everything is always fresh"}
{"text":"Quaint little restaurant on the South side of Bowness Road in the heart of the Bowness district.  Well kept, clean restaurant that obviously is a favourite in the neighbourhood.  It's early on a Friday evening and the place is busy with both seated and take out.  We had the vietnamese subs, pad Thai, Vietnamese coffee and a Chinese beer. Wow all was very tasty and arrived fast. The owner is the host and server.  What a fun and friendly guy.  This was not our first visit nor will be our last. Come on down and enjoy a little walk around the \" old town\" before or after your meal."}
{"text":"Its kind of hard to find, but worth it.
right across from the RBC, beside the UPS store.

the owner is a super nice lady! the pho tastes very similar to the pho I had while I was traveling in Vietnam this past summer.
I would like to try more from their menu, but so far so good!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!! The owner is so wonderful to deal with and is really helpful when dealing with allergies.  The peanut satay soup is our favourite and we always ask for it extra spicy. It is definately a bit different than the traditional beef satay soups but still fantastic if you go in with an open mind.  Another favourite is the lemongrass chicken- so flavourful.  We have never eaten in but the food and staff for take out is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Its a pretty good little vietnamese place. Always tastes great and is good for the price."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place with a bit of a pan-asian menu (Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese).   I only tried the Pad Thai, which was a noble effort, but was more ketchupy than I prefer.  But all the dishes look like great value for the low, low prices, with fresh-tasting ingredients, prompt service, and your dishes served piping hot.  Worth a look."}
{"text":"This little Vietnamese restaurant in Bowness hasn't even been open a whole year yet, but I have no doubt that is is the best Vietnamese I have had yet.  Appearing very small from the outside, the inside is nicely decorated, the tables spaced well.  

We came in on a Friday night and the place was full, always a good sign!  There isn't anywhere to wait, except maybe near the bar in the back of the restaurant, so we felt a bit awkward hanging around by the door.  The owner was very apologetic about us having to wait, even though we could tell he was really the only one serving.  After a short wait we got a table and had to wait again to have it cleaned and get menus. Again the owner was very apologetic.  We ordered the grilled chicken salad wraps and the vermicelli, always a safe bet when trying a new place.  I also got a taro bubble tea, which turned out to be the best, most flavourful, bubble tea I have ever had!  When we got our food we were pleasantly surprised at how fresh and tasty everything was!  Absolutely delicious!!

We now go a bit earlier, than that first time (like 4:30pm), and have no issue getting a table.  All the salad wraps are delish!  They don't use MSG and try to cater to allergies.  The portions are huge!  A meal for 2 people is usually under $30.  They are closed on Sundays.

This is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant!  I highly recommend trying out this gem of a place!!"}
{"text":"This is my local Vietnamese and it makes me so so happy.  The chicken sate soup is fabulous and perfect for lunch.  All of their seafood dishes are incredibly fresh also.  The food is done to order so best to call and pre-order if you are with a big group.  Also - check your take out before you leave...sometimes they forget stuff."}
{"text":"i found this place by accident and only been there twice and would def recommend it!  just had pho first time and then second time tried pad thai for my first time ever and it was delish!  I also ordered take out and sub was eaten and tho the rest (wor won ton soup, a beef noodle dish, prawn appetizer) wasnt eaten first nite...it was second and third nites as it was in take out containers and even nuking it...the veggies were still very crisp and noodles were not mushy...feels like a higher classed hole in the wall and male server was amazing but kudos to cook(s)!!!!  so i say try it...as you might have a new fave place!  cant miss specials as they are just taped to wall by each table..."}
{"text":"I thought that it was great that they offer MSG free pho. It is super hard to find in this city and the best part is, you don't get that pho hang over. I ordered a guava bubble tea that was refreshing and yummy."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Vietnamese Sub look no further!!! Hands down the best in the city.  Perfect amount of spice and not to much cilantro.  Haven't lived in the area for many years now but will still make the trip here when I'm craving a sub.

I have had some of their other menu items and have never been disappointed. Great iced Vietnamese Coffee as well."}
{"text":"Not recommend. The beef tastes bad, not fresh, there is not much noodle in a large size pho."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place for some comforting pho on a cold night. #33 (beef satay) is amazing, the creamy peanut based broth is unlike any other satay you have ever tried. This place is also to my knowledge is one of the few Vietnamese places that doesn't use MSG which I love. The last thing that keeps me coming back is the owner, he is such a kind genuine man that remembers my name every time I come."}
{"text":":( I was really hoping for better. After being told by everyone how awesome this place is, and living super close I had to check it out. 

Being a celiac, one of the only things I can eat and love is vermicelli. Now most places have a page of options for this, here not so much. There was 3 to pick from. 

My order was supposed to come with salad rolls, not spring rolls, which it was the opposite way, the meal itself was ok, but I've had better, a lot better actually. I found them to be really slow as well, especially seeing as we were the only ones in there and we were getting take out. If I have to go again I will, but there are other places I'll hit up first. 

Oh! and you can only pay debit if your order is more than $10, other wise it has to be cash. I'm a perosn that always carries cash, but most aren't so make sure you are aware of that before you go."}
{"text":"Very bad service....Actually no service at all.  I had to go up to counter to get menu and place orders.  Owner was very grumpy.  Portion of pho was very small for price - too much sugar in soup.  Dumplings was cheap but too oily.  Not going back ever again."}
{"text":"This small, family run restaurant serves up tasty, fresh tasting food at a good price. Laminated paper menus that bring to life all the fancy design techniques and word art of Microsoft Word 1993, give the Bowness Vietnamese Restaurant a certain charm. Why? Because you can get a giant bowl of delicious beef sate peanut soup for under $10 from excellent people - that's really special! 

Speaking of specials (and smooth segues), I love the giant growing number of \"Specials\" they have. It seems like instead of redoing the menus, every time they offer a new item, they add it on as a special, and feature it on a paper sign with rainbow gradient word art scotch taped to the wall next to each of the tables. These quirks make me smile because it still loops down to the same thing. Fantastic folks and great food at a great price. 

If I lived in the area, there's no doubt I'd be a regular here."}
{"text":"This is an excellent Vietnamese restaurant in a little strip mall beside Bow Cycle.  The food is always fresh and flavorful, the bubble teas and smoothies are the best in town and they don't use MSG.   Our favorites are: grilled shrimp skewers, spring rolls, beef ball noodle soup, BBQ short ribs with rice, basa with rice, and grilled meats with rice vermicelli bowls.
       The owners are very friendly, attentive and accomodating(my son has a mild peanut allergy).  Reservations are recommended on most days because they can fill up pretty fast!"}
{"text":"Tried Bowness Vietnamese for takeout today (Friday evening). The restaurant was fairly difficult to find - no lit up sign, and it was packed! 
The menu was extremely small. But there were enough choices. We got one of their subs, lemongrass chicken, shrimp salad rolls and spring rolls.
The food was absolutely wonderful and extremely fresh. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Bright, clean, cheerful. Delicious chicken satay noodle soup, yummy mango and lychee bubble tea. Simple menu, not a whole lot of choices, but what's there is good because of their deliberate focus. Fresh food, friendly service, great value. Been here enough times I've lost count."}
{"text":"Ate here for supper tonight. We started with the spring rolls and had the special seafood pad thai and the cooked beef and beef ball noodle soup. Let me start by saying that nothing that we ordered tasted authentic. Spring rolls tasted store bought and of little at all and that was echoed through to the soup.  The broth tasted like nothing. Perhaps plain beef broth from a can. This was by far the least flavourful pho I have ever had and I love pho. The vermicelli noodles in both dishes were badly overcooked. Seafood pad thai was a glop of noodles in an overly tangy \"too much ketchup\" sauce. 
Not once did the manager ask us how things were. Wouldn't even look at me when I paid. 

What a shame....

Please find your vietnamese elsewhere."}
{"text":"As we were visiting Calgary, this place stood out for us. The interior is nothing special but random posters and paintings on the wall. The tables were sparkling clean like the dishes we were served in. We ordered two mains and an appetizer. The spring rolls were pretty huge and lasted long enough till our mains came out. I got the beef pho while my friend got shrimp rice with veggies. The food was delicious and you could tell it was made fresh. The portions were pretty huge and the price was fair. WILL RETURN"}
{"text":"Always tasty! The owner is a sweet man who remembers my preferences every time. The service is good, the food is always tasty and we always enjoy it."}
{"text":"I have tried the chicken Vietnamese sub and it was incredible! I highly recommend this place. Service was quick and price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Fantastic little Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of Bowness. This is my boyfriends favourite place to eat, the owner knows him by name and his usual order. I had a huge craving for Pho, and I wanted to see what he kept raving about, so we ended up here. Luckily for us, we were seated right before the dinner rush as the place was packed about 30 minutes later. We ordered the salad rolls and spring rolls to start...both were wonderful. The salad rolls tasted so fresh (and didn't smell funny like they do at a lot of other Viet places!) and the spring rolls were so hot and tasty. I was SO impressed with my soup and my boyfriend got his usual vermicelli dish which was also excellent. Our food came out very quickly and the service was great, I think it's a family owned place, everyone moved very quickly and fluidly and were all so friendly. I also finished with a honeydew bubble tea and it was great! The price was extremely fair considering the quality and amount of food we got...I WILL be returning! Love it!"}
{"text":"We went tonight on a whim to try it out and WOW!  The food was fresh, tasty and beautifully served.  This small place could easily be missed from it's unassuming exterior.  Inside, it's clean, smells good and the people are friendly.  It's freshly painted and the granite top tables are sparkling clean.  
We had Saigon beer which was great!  Then the fried taro with egg, beef sate soup with the peanut sauce and rice with chicken and vegetables.  Everything was great!
You will wait for your food as it's made fresh and worth the wait.  Our meal including 2 beers was $40 which we think is very reasonable for freshly made food.  We live in the area and are delighted to find this.
We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Cheap, friendly, excellent value. Fresh ingredients. A wee bit spoiled by the prawns not being real. Oh well you can't have everything."}
