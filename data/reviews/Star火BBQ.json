{"text":"Probably the best Korean restaurant in Chambana. The server cooks the meat for you so you can relax and drink soju."}
{"text":"this place has got some fire korean bbq, highly recommended the beef bugogi. Nicely marinated"}
{"text":"Very nice and clean looking inside as I would expect for a newly opened restaurant. The service was a bit slow, but all in all good. The food was pricey considering it wasn't all that great, at least not up to my expectations or standards for a $18-$50 meal.  I had the bul go gi and it wasn't bad I have had way better in the area for much less my son had the bi bin bab and he said he has had better as well.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. I really wanted to give this place a great review and five stars, but good quality food is what I seek and the star BBQ doesn't come close."}
{"text":"I love Korean BBQ and star BBQ has one of the best BBQ in CU! we tried their pork belly, beef brisket and their marinated bulgogi. Their bulgogi (beef) was one of the best I have tried in the US! And the waitress and manager were super nice and attentive. They are having all-you-can-eat BBQ for $23 now and it was a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour to get a portion of what I ordered. Gentleman kept talking about kitchen issues but never did anything to make our experience bearable. Maybe the \"so sorry's\" were supposed to make up for the fact that the only thing I got was my entree. No appetizer, rice, etc. Poor management. Terrible experience. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. The waitress cooks your food for you which was surprising to me as all the Korean BBQ places I've been to in Chicago more or less leave you to your own devices while occasionally changing the grill. Not here. She was very attentive. We got the all you can eat meal and everything was excellent especially the pork. Will be going back."}
{"text":"This is the best Korean restaurant in Champaign area.  I don't care for cooking on the table, and this place will cook it for you in the back.  A very nice option .  I also don't care for all you can eat crap since those are crap.  This place has the most accurate flavor to soups, banchan, and stews.  The food tastes clean, and there is no residual garlic red pepper taste.  We will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"A bit too much cost cutting, I would say, but overall pretty good.  Pretty good bibimbap. A little heavy on the rice, a little light on the meat.  Banchan dishes were small, and there were only four dishes --Â but they were good.  No barley tea. :("}
{"text":"I think this place is new, the place offers traditional Korean BBQ , I would recommend to my friends, firstly it is not an \"all you can eat place\" the meat is premium here compared to other places.  We order a combo M size which is enough for 2-3 people , great thing about this is that they serve superb side dishes including many types of kimchi , mashed sweet potatoes , steamed eggs,vegetables  and salads and they do refills!  The price came at 75$ which is very reasonable for the food we had. Hope you find this useful."}
{"text":"Four of us(all girls) went for bbq and ordered beef and pork medium combo. The beef and pork belly were tender and good. The portion size was a little small for to be shared by four girls."}
{"text":"Not good service.   Ordered was told the stove was broke so they were backed up.   Food came out at random time appetizer never came. Would not come back."}
{"text":"I dig this place. Very high quality food and option to cook your own meat, including all you can eat choices. The pork and beef bulgogi were great, but the best part was the sides, which are refilled however many times you prefer. They complement the meat perfectly, particularly the pickled radishes, which you can use as little tacos for the dish. The pork dumplings were stacked, far more filled than your typical dumplings. The ambience was kinda upscale as well, and the service was impeccable. Really friendly staff who took their time to go over the food and talk through all the options. I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I am not the one to complain about service but I guess today would be the first. I didn't not get to try the food. I heard from a friend it was delicious. I decided to give it a try today. My brother and I, arrived and was waiting to be seated. We were very patient. We waited almost 40 minutes and I'm not sure if the waiter saw us and ignored us or failed to look up and see two people standing there in plain sight. We left because we got tired of waiting. Granted the restaurant was not busy at all. There was only three tables. Any way, I do hope the next time I come, when I do give them a chance again. I wouldn't have to wait so long for some service."}
{"text":"Just OK. It's a fairly new restaurant, the decor is sleek but not very functional. The booth chairs are hard and stiff with no cushioning. The BBQ tables are nice but very little leg room or foot room. I wear a size 10 in Women's  and sneakers barely fit between the booth chair and table. Can't imagine how a larger person can sit comfortably at one of these tables.   On to food- we ordered seafood pancakes and the marinated combo large for the 4 of us. Seafood pancakes are on point but greasy. Bonchon was minimal and disappointing. Most including kimchi tasted like it's from a jar. Meats was ok but we've had better. The beef short ribs is not thinly sliced as described but more like a thin slice of steak- not the typical Kalbi we get on the east coast.   Overall, we got enough food even without rice ( we were not offered any) but not satisfactory to our palette. Probably will not go back as there are other options near UIUC."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered a Medium Combo 2. Our Server, David  told us that the Medium serves 2-3 people and the Large combo serves 4-6.  I can assure you we left the restaurant more than full. After we ordered our food arrived to the table in about 10 minutes but the whole cooking experience took about an hour.  Star?BBQ is a do-it-yourself restaurant, but our server was more than happy to cook the meat for us. Sometimes when you go to a BBQ place the meat can be too chewy or have too much fat but that was not a problem here. The meat was great. One thing that is not stated on the menu is that the combos include a salad for each person eating at the table, a side of some delicious kimchi, a side or spinach, another dish that I did not know but was great, a bowl of soup and some interesting but great scrambled eggs ( 1 bowl of soup and 1 bowl of eggs per table ).   Star?BBQ is clean, fun, friendly and delicious.   Great for a night our with a group of friends.  Korean BBQ beats Hibachi all day"}
