{"text":"SO GOOD!  Stop reading this and go to Koi Poke now.  I am a regular at the other location in DC Ranch and decided to check out this new location in Arcadia.  They have managed to replicate the same quality, service, and atmosphere at this location.  The core that makes Koi Poke just so dang good is their focus on super fresh fish.  It doesn't matter what option you get (although you must try the Hawaiian Tuna) it tastes super fresh - it's quality you can taste.  You put your protein option on top of either rice or spring mix, add some sauce, and load up on toppings.  The other thing that makes Koi Poke stand out to me among it's competitors is its use of REAL crab that is superb.  They also load you up on their wide variety of toppings (Brussel sprouts!)  which really lets you create a unique and customized bowl that is delicious every time.  Lastly, the service is bar none.  They take as much as you need to get it right.  They explain your options, make recommendations, and let you sample.  Koi Poke is phenomenal and a gift to the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"Great fresh tasting food combined with such friendly and helpful service!!! Nicely done Koi Poke!"}
{"text":"So happy they moved in across the street from me! They were really accommodating to my vegan questions, went above and beyond to check the sauce ingredients they weren't certain of. And my bowl was great! Slightly pricey for tofu but it was flavorful and fresh, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Used to be a regular customer of Ocean Poke Co. I will never go back once I've been to Koi Poke. Hands down one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"Perfect addition to the restaurant on Indian school. Large portions, they actually give you a \"scoop\" of fish."}
{"text":"I've hit all the poké places downtown, uptown, and Arcadia. Koi is hands down the best! Definitely get the spicy shoyu sauce and Hawaiian tuna."}
{"text":"This place beats all other poke in the area!! So good and so fresh and not stingy on the sides!!! Highly recommend !!'n"}
{"text":"Freshest Poke concept around.   Tried it tonight with the fam and something for everyone.  Customer service was on point as well.  Be back soon and frequently."}
{"text":"Delicious poke! Huge portions - great service - the freshest ingredients. The restaurant was clean and comfortable. The staff was super friendly and helped me figure out how to make a great bowl. They are knowledgeable and patient. Loved my experience and dinner!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from this place, DO NOT eat here. Not just me either, my sister and my dad got sick after eating here too."}
{"text":"Koi Poke is my favorite poke spot.. ever. It is reasonably priced for the quality and quantity! I have been to poke places in cali, Hawaii etc but this one comes out on top! The marinated tuna is soooo good (all of their fish/ protein taste fresh) and the sauces are all unique and very tasty. The coconut green tea is worth it as well. I just wish it was closer to my house since I live in Gilbert area.. maybe Koi will expand more in AZ. I wouldn't doubt it because this place is a 10/10!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had lunch at the second Koi Poke location. So glad we have a Koi Poke just a few miles from our home. Another fantastic Poke Bowl experience. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Dear (insert every other Poke Restaurant in Phoenix here),  I'm writing this to tell you that I'm leaving you forever. You've been good to me  for almost two years but yesterday I met Koi Poke-Arcadia, and it just wouldn't be fair to me (or you) for us to continue to see each other.  To be honest, it has now become clear to me that you have never really loved me as much as Koi loves me.   Koi listens to me and gives me what I need. Koi's servings are much bigger and satisfying than your's ever we're. And I'm sorry to have to tell you this but Koi's Poke just tastes better.  So anyway the bad news is I can't see you anymore.   Best of luck....  Karen"}
{"text":"This is my favorite poke place! They don't skimp out on portions and it is rightly priced. The employees are super nice and looks like they like working there. Tonight was my first night in but I will frequent over and over again. Only tip is to provide the consumers samples if they are curious of what it their product taste like. For a first timer it can definitely be confusing."}
{"text":"The new Koi Poke so much closer to my home. Talk about duplicating with no effort. I had the lobster with Spivey shoyu, edamame, and kale. Being from the east coast the lobster tasted very much the same. I was very pleased and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great service and best poke I have had so far! They have real crab meat, which is uncommon for az poke places. I have nothing bad to say at all, definitely recommend going in."}
{"text":"Great service and yummy food! Very clean! I would recommend to people who love fresh food."}
{"text":"I love Poke -- let me emphasize that! I do not live in AZ but happened to be visiting and found Koi Poke! Koi Poke is what it's about! I wish they had locations in Los Angeles! They have such fresh fish, delicious toppings (so many to add on to your bowl at no additional cost!) and the staff was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and friendly! Can't wait to come back here on my next AZ trip."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Fresh food and amAzingly clean!!! Compared to other poke places! Please try this new place! First time here the service was phenomenal. Must try butter sauce and Hawaiian tuna! #shoutout to prasilla! But Stephen you're still great! Thank you for the welcoming poke service!"}
{"text":"Great new Poke place. All others Poke joints need to step up their game.  This is the place!  Fresh ingredients, great portions and fewer up charges than the other guys...you know who you are!  Try Koi Poke you will not regret it.   Second time and just as good as the first."}
{"text":"I'd give Koi Poke 10 stars if I could. I love that they have the option to have 2 lines when busy, that's genius! And only one line during slower times, that means smaller amount of product out and refreshed options. All great in my book! Before sampling any of the sauces, I tried the bowl plain jane. It was not plain! The rice was great in flavor comparable to sushi rice at a fancy sushi joint. The fish was sooo fresh, zero fishy scent or taste JUST like it should be! The Hawaiian tuna was marinated with a purpose!  Unlike, some poki places where it can taste like citrus and the texture of a rubber band.  I got 3 sauces on the side... ALL OF THEM were stellar. Next time I'll probably mix the spicy shoyu and house for a bit of sweet and spicy! I've recently have taken to green tea and the blackberry jasmine they offer is ...sooooo... you guessed it..GOOD ! I think Koi Poke is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood and other poki places near & far should step up or step out!"}
{"text":"Effen A this was a damn good poke bowl! As fresh as you can get (except for chula seafood which is next level shit), great toppings, real crab meat and awesome service. I was very happy and stoked this place is so close. Beats Poke Bar and prices are on point too. Give it a shot, you'll be happy. Clean and inviting, great food. I'll be back Koi. Thx"}
{"text":"If you want high quality poke this is the spot to go. All of the fish is extremely fresh and the service is always phenomenal - the workers offer samples and help ensure that you are putting together a good bowl. The Hawaiian tuna is delicious along with the spicy shoyu sauce over everything, and I always add avocado too. I can always count on getting a healthy, high quality meal when I come here."}
{"text":"Wow! I found my new favorite poke today! This place is WONDERFUL! the location is close for me but the store is a little hidden in the corner so I missed them for a while. The food is very fresh and portions are generous. I am eating poke 2 times per week. I have tried almost all of the competitor places and while I found a few good ones, they're not even close to this quality. The atmosphere is great, too. While its modern like all poke spots, it's got a sunny warmth to it. It also feels upbeat but not too crazy. The staff is very helpful so don't worry about trying the sauces while you find your favorite - they're very accommodating. One last note - my tummy doesn't do well with greens unless they're super clean and this place treated me kind! For your favorite Hawaiian treat, get to Koi Poke!"}
{"text":"I've tried plenty of Poke spots but this one is without a doubt the best. The freshest ingredients ever and that's important when you are taking about fish! You can taste the difference in the quality of ingredients. If that's not enough ( even though it should be) the staff here is so pleasant! Always great attitude, and ready to answer questions and ensure you leave happy! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"By far the best Poke place in Phoenix and only rivaled by its sister store in North Scottsdale. No one has fish as fresh and just like their other location, this place is immaculate and the staff is incredible. They do not have the Hawaiian Snow Ice at this location which I really like nor do they have hard alcohol but I'm told they're getting beer wine and sake soon. Either way, if you want the best Poke in AZ this is your place. Honestly, no other Poke in town compares and those who say otherwise simply don't know any better."}
{"text":"Wow... Koi Poke is my new favorite poké place in town.    Sure, I've only been one time, but I was sold at first bite.  Thanks to Kennedy and the Koi Poke - Arcadia staff working last night for being so friendly and welcoming upon arrival.    My husband was ready to leave because the place was empty when we walked in, but after he saw my reaction to the Hawaiian Tuna sample and the look of the beautiful bowls I was creating, he decided to get one for himself as well.  I ordered 2 medium bowls (one for myself and the other for my mother-in-law), + a side bowl or rice and edamame for the kids...   I may have overdone it with all of the ingredients, but it was delicious!  I was impressed with how clean the fish and toppings area was as I went down the assembly line building.  For the medium bowls, I had 1/2 white rice and 1/2 mixed greens, topped with Hawaiian tuna, salmon, and spicy tuna.  From there, I added cucumber, edamame, brussels sprouts, seaweed, crabmeat, masago, and maybe another topping or two.    The $12 price point for this is more than fair... actually a bargain!  I cannot wait to return to Koi Poke - Arcadia again real soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite poke bowl places to go in Phoenix. There are many poke bowl places in the Phoenix area but this one tops them all with their small, medium and large bowls. The employees there are super kind and willing to give you as many samples as you want. Overall, they make they restaurant a much more positive place to eat along with the great food. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Really good and fresh but SOOO many bones in the fish. They did not properly cut and clean the fish. Really ruined my experience of their food. You would think with how expensive it is, they could take a little more time and care to properly prepare their food. My first time here and I will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very fresh and delicious sauces to choose from. Portions are very generous. The customer service was also fantastic! Will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"I was in the Phoenix metro area and was looking for the nearest Poki bowl, subsequently looked on yelp and found this gem. I believe this location just opened as the restaurant was nice and clean. I was introduced by a young male and gave me a run down of how there Poki bowl differentiated from others. Pretty much the concept remains the same but the quality of ingredients improved. They actually have real crab meat and do not charge extra if you decide to include into your bowl. The amount of sauces is also better as you get more variety. Kudos to the young gentlemen as he provided me with excellent customer service. He even had me sample some of the seafood and sauces. I will definitely back again! I believe the only down side was the amount of food I got for the price. The portion size is less desired but other than that solid Poki establishment!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first.  I mean seafood in Phoenix?  and I've had a few great Poke bowls when i resided near the beach in LA.  Divine,  clean, DELICIOUS,  and fresh.  I'm on my way to take some to work right now,  and no, I've not received any freebies, other than a taste of the hawaiian ahi.   my new craving...CHECK IT OUT!!"}
{"text":"I've tried at least 5 different poke spots even went to chandler to try a sushirrito..this is my favorite place by far! This location in particular is great, the guy behind the counter explained their menu and had me try a few samples...they make all of their sauces in house and I wasn't sure what I wanted.   It can get a little pricey especially if you add avocado or extra crab but the quality is amazing. I ordered the Hawaiian tuna, salmon and yellowtail..perfect size and everything was so fresh!I also tried the sriracha aioli and spicy shoyu on the side..loved the flavors!   This is definitely going to be my go to spot when I'm craving poke. So glad I tried them!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?! This place is phenomenal. The employees they have working here are so incredibly friendly and personable; not to mention they're great at their job! Every time I'm in here the staff is awesome! Great job hiring such rockstars! The fact that you get to build you own fresh poké is a huge bonus of course! I'm so glad I found this place just by googling \"poké near me\". Will recommend to everyone! Reasonable prices, fresh ingredients, and amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite poké restaurant in Phoenix! The flavors are to die for and everything is SO fresh. Definitely get all of the seasonings / seeds / toppings at the end of the line. There are several poké places down the street from me near downtown Phoenix and I always drive 20 minutes to go to Koi Poké instead! The customer service is always beyond expectations. Everyone I've encountered incredibly sweet, knowledgeable and passionate about the restaurant."}
{"text":"There's a location closer to my home but I was in the area and decided to come in. It's always a good time for poké! This place has a really cool setup; most poke places have their counters against one side with a wall behind and you move along the line and order. Here, the employees are in the middle of a square setup and they have two sides for maximum efficiency, though only one side was being used today. This creates a more open and inviting atmosphere, and they had booth seating on both sides of the place.   It was nice that once the gentleman finished up with a group, he came to assist me. I got my standard base of half white rice and half spring mix in a smol bowl ($10) with salmon and Hawaiian tuna. They also have lobster here, for a steep $4 extra. Avocado is $2 extra, phew! Toppings are similar to those of other poke shops, and I got my favorite: edamame, green onion, avocado, cucumbers, and crab meat. Dried toppings include onions, furikake, and garlic. But the sauces, ooh wee they have some good ones. I went a bit wild and got their spicy shoyu, sweet chili lime and spicy house aioli. So much sauce, I really like their chili lime one, the sweet flavor added a nice dynamic. The seafood tasted fresh and all the ingredients worked well together, though my bowl was so full that it was hard to mix them (not the worst problem to have).  The folks here were so welcoming and friendly, I was glad to see business was steady during early dinner time. I look forward to visiting their sister locations and signing up for their rewards program. FYI: one bowl is one point, and 10 points gets you something but the best part is the points combine from all Koi Poke locations you visit. Very cool!"}
{"text":"I have pretty much been to every Poke place in AZ and even a few in CA and my favorite has been Koi Poke in DC Ranch which is close to home. Well I recently learned that Koi opened up a location in Arcadia so I thought I'd give it a try since it's close to my work. My only concern was if they could duplicate the quality/freshness of the food and service at the North Scottsdale one. Koi Poke Arcadia did not disappoint! Everything I ordered was as fresh as can be! The salmon, yellowtail and octopus were fantastic! If you live or work near this location I highly recommend you try it."}
{"text":"So happy to have a Koi near my work. I go to the store in McDowell mountain on weekends now I can have bowls during the week !!! Best Poke in Arizona"}
{"text":"First of all THANK YOU!!! So excited that Koi Poke opened another location!! If you haven't had a chance to check this place out do yourself a favor and go NOW!! They definitely don't miss!! I fell in love with this place the first time I tried it and always make it a staple stop every time I'm back in the Phoenix area. Incredibly fresh delicious fish, the best sauces, generous portions and great toppings! The staff are very helpful and efficient and help you create a great bowl if you're new to the poke world! Thanks again for opening up a second location!! Keep them coming and keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"YESSSSSSS I LOVE IT HERE!  Okay so last night was only my first time... but the bowl was so fresh I will be going back very soon. :)  Super high fish quality (I'm picky about this as I've been sick from other poke places) and fresh ingredients overall. My favorite was the salmon. They also offer tofu as a \"meat\" for non-fish eaters, and it was delicious!  Wide variety of sauces - I got the sweet chili lime. It really was not too sweet, but they did recommend mixing it with one of their spicy sauces if you're looking for a little kick.   The topping area was very impressive with lots of options to choose from (more than most other places I've been to) and they did not skimp on the portions they were scooping.  I'm a big fan and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time tonight and it was ONOLICIOUS. I had the small bowl with Hawaiian tuna and spicy shoyu with almost all the toppings. It was very fresh and delicious. BTW, I'm from HI and I think this place is the real deal. If they start to offer a side of Mac salad and Kim chee...I might just cry from Happiness."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place!  I have eaten there at least once a week since I found it. I love that you can create your own meal. White or brown rice? Spring mix?  Tuna, poke, salmon, octopus, lobster, yellowtail.....and lots of sauces to choose from. Once you've made those decisions, you get to top your creation with whatever you choose. Edamame, green onion, ginger, cucumber, kale, cilantro, jalapeño and on and on. I was told the fish is flown in daily and have no reason not to believe it. It is always fresh and top quality. Never once has it been fishy or subpar. The toppings are fresh and there are so many to choose from. They have small (2 scoops of whatever fish you choose), medium (3 scoops) and large (4 scoops).  Small is usually plenty, but I'm always sad when I get to the end!  Can't recommend this place highly enough. Please support them so we can keep them in Arcadia!   BTW, they are nestled in the corner of the shopping center--kind of hard to see. Look for the \"Nothing Bundt Cakes\". They are right next door!"}
{"text":"Was waiting for this to open up and it was worth the wait! Great fresh fish and the trimmings! We had the spicy tuna and salmon over greens and brown rice with cucumbers,edamame,green onion,sesame seeds and fresh crab. Our sauce was a mix of spicy shosu(sp?) and sweet which was a good mix! Yum-O! We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Best poke in Phoenix. Also the people who were working were so nice and friendly it made us feel so comfortable. They were so welcoming that even if it wasn't that good I would go back. Their fish is fresh and never frozen and the quality of everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Great poke! You build a bowl with what you like and they have plenty of protein and toppings to choose from. Start your meal with a white rice, brown rice or salad base. Add Hawaiian poke, tuna, salmon, shrimp, yellow tail, octopus, lobster or tofu. Then top it with a spicy dressing, cilantro, avocado, masago, green onion, red onion, kale, ginger, shaved Brussel sprouts, cucumber or jalapeño. I forgot add a crunch to the top with crispy onion, crispy garlic, sesame seeds or dried sea weed.   It was fresh and absolutely delicious!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This one of the best Poke places in the valley. The selection is wonderful, fish is fresh, and it's very competitively priced. The food is as tasty as you want to make it. The customer service is friendly and down to earth. Lastly, the restaurant is always extremely clean.   I have been here 5 times and look forward to coming back soon. Kudos on the good work Poke peeps!"}
{"text":"First time! Convenient location for me. Great prices. The staff member that helped me was pleasant and knowledgeable. Fish was delicious and fresh. The veggies were plenty and diverse. Sauces were standard for poke bars. I did think the decor was interesting. It's next to the bundt cake place, come on now..........5-stars clearly.  I will definitely be back! Healthy, delicious, convenient and affordable. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I have been to all the other poke bowl places near here--there are several--this one is THE best. The ingredients are the freshest and most flavorful. Fish is delicious.  I've been back twice in one week and will come back often! Yum!"}
{"text":"Koi Poke has by far the freshest and best ingredients in AZ. Being from CA, I can attest to its freshness AND its easy on the pocket as it is a fast casual kinda spot. Can't wait for more locations to open. Come soon to the West Valley please. Need something close to work. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the best poke I've ever had! It's fresh,     great condiment select, and the sauces are delicious. Jump on the Koi Poke bus if you haven't tried it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What can i say about this spot other than thank you. I love poke and have been waiting for an opportunity to give this a try since it opened 2 weeks ago. Thank you for not letting me down. I have been a Serious advocate in sending all Of my friends to to Koi. My favorite is the Hawaiian tuna by far. Makes me think of my days of Eating poke on the shores in Hawaii. Another huge bonus Is they offer gluten free sauces. They offer you crab mix with real crab in it. And on top Of all this yum. They serve fresh brewed teas in four flavors. Blackberry jasmine green tea by far my favorite. Keep up the good work Koi. They have so many locations coming... i can't wait to share this gem with all My friends"}
{"text":"Best quick Poke place in town!   I finally got the chance to check out Koi Poke yesterday and it did not disappoint. The minute I walked in I was warmly greeted and shown the ropes. The girl who made my bowl was darling and she offered samples to try and advice on what was her favorite. She was so friendly and knowledgeable which made the experience just that much more pleasant.   I chose a medium bowl which came with 3 scoops of protein; I got their Hawaiian tuna (scrumptious), shrimp, and regular tuna (all of which were divine). Along with my protein I got brown rice, spring mixed greens, crab salad, sesame seeds, crispy garlic, crispy onions, green onions, red onions, shaved brussel sprouts, and the house sauce as well as a few other sauces on the side to try (all of which blended perfectly with my yummy concoction) The great thing about the toppings is that I could add as much as I wanted without being nickel and dimed as many of the other poke places do. The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous for what you pay.   Everything about the atmosphere was was clean clean clean (something I keep a keen eye out for when ordering raw fish of any kind). There are plenty of comfortable places to sit and eat, and the food all looks appetizing. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly without being over the top (if you know what I mean).   My experience at Koi Poke was lovely from the moment I walked in the door to the last bite of my food. I'll be back soon and recommend it to all who enjoy great Poke!"}
{"text":"First of all I would like to say that this fish taste fresher than any $500 sashimi I have ever had. Me and my boyfriend have been to the Koi Poke on Pima and no joke I have never seen so much consistent great amazing excellent service with absolutely any restaurant in my whole life. We arrived around 8 o clock here and there was a long long line. With only two people at the end of the night which is reasonable . No matter how long the line was they never rushed anything , they never got irritated or mad. They even ask you if you want your lobster in a different sauce . They used polite words like yes mam no sir . Honestly I have been looking for a new poke spot because I go to Ahi poke bowl a lot and the fish is smooshy there and the service is absolutely terrible , with the most attitude you have ever seen. Koi poke and Ahi poke bowl are night and day. My service is completely dedicated to Koi poke. The look of the poke spot, how clean it is, how amazing the service is , makes you really just want to come back all the time. I asked what there names were and they said Ben and Tyler. I was so happy to see them be so patient and not rush at all to make sure my food was perfect . He even put a different set of gloves on for every new bowl. Thank you for being invented Koi Poke !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, mind blown.  Hands down the best poke I've had in Phoenix.  The freshness of the fish and the flavors are out of this world.  And amazing customer service.  Immaculately clean.  A must have in the rotation."}
{"text":"Koi poke is the best poke around! Service is awesome, food is amazing, sauce is awesome!! Restaurant is super clean, and just an amazing experience every time! Would recommend 10/10 times. I have tried all the poke places around and this is by far the best, their saying is 72 hours boat to bowl, because all of the fish is flown in daily, super fresh."}
{"text":"One of my favorite quick spots for a healthy lunch. Fresh Hawaiian-style tuna poke, shredded crab, and yellowtail with a host of different sauces to customize just the way you want it. If you're in the mood to treat yourself, go for the champagne butter sauce. O-M-G.   The freshly brewed iced tea comes in a variety of exotic flavors and is the perfect addition to a healthy lunch that is Keto, paleo, low-carb friendly. You can opt for field greens in place of rice.   Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"72 hours from boat to bowl - I believe it!!! So yummy.  Very helpful describing the options and making recommendations.  Hawaiian tuna is amazing, next time I will select it for all protein options."}
{"text":"What can I say other than this place is amazing! My fish was super fresh, the line moved quick and the sauces were delicious. My friend loved hers too. I mixed the salmon & tuna.   I found that other review of someone claiming to get food poisoning hilarious. It was obviously fake as the only other reviews on their account were from the same day/time.  I've eaten here multiple times and everything has always been extremely fresh and clean."}
{"text":"Trying to be less of a fatass. It's an uphill battle.  Thought about meth. Weighed the pros and cons.  Pros of meth: big productivity boost, always dancing (burning calories), cheap, and eliminates appetite (savings + fewer calories)  Cons of meth: illegal, always dancing (even when you don't want to be), makes you lose teeth, not the right kind of weight loss  Having weighed the pros and cons, I decided not to do meth. So I needed another way to lose weight. Eating less? Impossible. Exercising more? Ain't got time for that. That leaves one thing left - eating healthy.  I've known poke is healthy for awhile, but typically it isn't filling and it's always too expensive for the amount of food I get. Enter Koi Poke.  I've been twice, and left twice satisfied. Good job guys.  1. It's filling. They let you put as many scoops of non-protein in your bowl as you can fit. I can fit a lot in the belly, so I have them fit a lot in the bowl. They seem to get where I'm coming from and always load it up. Not the type of poke place that skimps on scoops. I appreciate that.  2. It's healthy. I eat a lot, but the lot that I eat is a lot of healthy stuff. The four scoops of protein that comes in a big bowl meets my need for meat. Then I just gorge on everything else vegetable and mineral to satiate the appetite. Both times I've been to Koi I haven't left a thing from the bar out my bowl. First time to a poke joint where I haven't felt hungry when I leave. I guess I can do this poke thing. Rock on.  3. It's expensive. It's still expensive, but at least I'm spending money on healthy filling food.  4. It's not meth. Here's the really important thing about Koi Poke: it's not meth. So while it's expensive, I still have my teeth, and while I'm not dancing all the time, I can eat all I want with the knowledge that I'll remain healthy and thin enough to dance when I want to. So it's kind of a mix of some of the positives of meth, without the cons.  I would absolutely recommend Koi to other big eaters like me looking to stop being such huge, lard-soaked, fat-asses. If you can foot the bill, you can have your cake and eat it too. Except in this case, your cake is raw fish.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place has very very fresh poke.  I'm so glad that this is as good as the one up in north Scottsdale and I don't have to drive all that way anymore."}
{"text":"Just wow, 5 stars strong and I see why. Of course, you can pick and choose what you want which is part of the reason I decided to come here. Can you believe it, they offered a taste test of their main favorite tuna poke and it was off the hook! 4 scoops of that please, nevermind make it 8 scoops.   Fresh fish and veggies is a must for Poke and yes its fresh here too, no fishy smell.   Dont forget the service, the employees are amazing and make you feel like family.   For sure stop in and eat here. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Yep, this is my new poke spot in Arcadia. There's another very popular joint not too far down the road....but I've never loved it there. I decided to give Koi a shot this week, and I'm so glad I did. The ingredients are fresh, the Hawaiian tuna is as good as all the raves claim, and yes...the crab salad is real crab. Nothing fancy or necessarily mind blowing about Koi Poke, but it is so good!"}
{"text":"WOW, WOW, WOW...this Poke place is no joke. I wasn't just pleasantly surprised, I was surprisingly blown away! The place looks cool...whatever. The people working there were very nice...blah blah blah.  The line moved fast....yeah yeah yeah. But the fish, OMFG the fish! It was so fresh and so good, I never thought it could be done like this in the desert.  I tasted a piece of the yellowtail naked (the yellowtail was naked, not me) before ordering and it was unreal! Seriously, I could have eaten my whole bowl like that. Stop reading this and go there now. You will thank me."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious poke spot.  Prices are a little more expensive than some of the places we've seen (by only a dollar or two), but you get a ton more for your buck.  The fish options are fresh and taste like they just came out of the ocean (try the house-marinaded and the yellowtail tuna!).  Serving sizes are very reasonable - I ate a medium bowl but could easily have been full with a small bowl.  The small/medium/large only denotes the number of types of fish you can get, not the number of side ingredients - and the side ingredients don't disappoint!  I said yes to every possible free item and added on the avocado for $2 extra (not necessary, looking back on it; there are more than enough delicious options).  Totally will be back!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Koi Poke after driving by it everyday and omg it is sooo good! The quality of fish is amazing and the portions are huge. There is a lot more variety than most poke places around the valley. When I went, the owners happened to be there and they were extremely friendly and passionate about the restaurant. Also, the restaurant is very very clean. I definitely recommend this place over any other poke stop in the valley."}
{"text":"Amazing service and a beautiful bowl every time! I came in just a few minutes before closing and the staff was still super welcoming and helpful! I love the house sauce and the champagne butter sauce!!! The fish is also always so fresh! Best poke in town!"}
