{"text":"Amazing. The brunch was very good. I wanted to try everything on the menu. Very friendly service. Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Have had brunch here a couple times. Great pancakes and tasty coffee. Never had to line up or wait for a table, which is awesome! Also, open earlier than most brunch places on the weekend. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went for Sunday brunch and absolutely loved the food! 

We had the smoked salmon w/ latkae with amazing gluten free bread. The latkae was like eating a cloud, probably the best I've ever had! 

Also had the gluten free pancakes and they were delicious. 

The service was also exceptional! Very clean and tidy place. 


Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"I went for brunch today and I got the recommended shakshuka 16$ and salmon and latkes 18$. Was not impressed with the food. The shakshuka has dry tough meatballs and the feta had gone sour. I really wanted to like it as it was the first try. The food was bland and very small portions for the price. I was told that the food was authentic but I've had better when I travelled to that region of the world. I was also told the smoked salmon was so far superior to the store bought quality. It really tasted worse which is not a good comparison. I've had better locally smoked salmon elsewhere. It was very slow when I went so I would expect service to be better but it wasn't. It seems like the place where they want to be hip and relevant. It just doesn't fit. Bad food bad service. I'll save my money and go to other better options in the area."}
{"text":"Amazig food! I got sheftalia, it was to die for! Full of flavour, filling but light at the same time! Delicious! Highly recommended! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch and was greeted by the waiter, who was holding menus, and seated immediately. He didn't give us any menus, just seated us and walked away. After 5 minutes, he came out and cleared a table, still no menus. At the 10 minute mark I got up, walked to the front and grabbed my own menu. We ordered Shakshuka and the Smoked Salmon with Latkas. The portions were very small for the prices charged. The Shakshuka barely had any meat in it, it was a pool of tasteless tomato liquid with two eggs floating in it. The Salmon and Latkas, again, small, tasteless and really not worth the price. The latkas were a bit greasy and had no real wow factor to them. I wanted to like this place because the menu is interesting but unfortunately I am taking a pass on returning. Not enough value or taste."}
{"text":"Had brunch there today for the first time.  Great options on the menu. Nice flavours.  We tried the Mushroom Toast with poached eggs, the gluten free pancakes and the eggs with sausage.  Everything was very good and tasty.  The coffee was also very good.  Highly recommended.

We took a peek at their dinner menu while we were there as well and it looks really interesting.  Based on our experience, we plan to go back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Middle of the road. 

Got a couple of Falafel plates to go (and a beet Salad) $40 felt like just a little too much for the amount of food. The Falafel came with a couscous heavy tabbouleh which all tasted very dry. I requested a gluten free pita and was disappointed that all I got was a slice of (gluten free) bread. 

So far so so-so. 

I will likely return as I enjoy Cypriot food, am hoping for a better experience."}
{"text":"A small, cosy super friendly addition to the neighbourhood. Brunch was the best, with a creative menu, beautiful presentation and alive with well balanced and diverse flavours. Lots of homemade items and great choices for carnivores and vegans alike.
Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for brunch in a Sunday.  The place is cozy, week decorated with pretty hand crafted furniture.  
The food was just fine. Reading from the various signs at the place  a place a made for organic and local food, but our waiter never mentioned anything about those quality ingredients or the drinks. We received no guidance nor comments about the food and just asked if were made a decision.  For a place with a $18 sausage and egg breakfast I was expecting more. In the end the food was ok and the service wad lacking."}
{"text":"After doing errands on the Danforth, I stumbled upon Rikkochez and I am happy I did! We enjoyed the all-day brunch menu on a Saturday afternoon. The menu had plenty of vegetarian, gluten-free, and vegan options.  We shared the oat pancakes with apple sauce, labneh and maple syrup and the mushroom toast with tamari and a poached egg.  The atmosphere is cozy with probably 10 tables or so.  Our waiter informed us that they make an effort to use locally sources ingredients.  My only complaint is that the restaurant was quite empty and our food took a little too long to come out (although, provides reassurance that everything is made fresh!)  I will definitely come back to check out the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"Been here for both brunch and dinner - love the local, sustainable food mission of this restaurant - very reasonably priced and diverse food options for being organic/slow food sourcing, including those for meat eaters, vegetarians, vegans and gluten free folks. The food is not overly complicated - very clean, delicious and flavourful. Service is always welcoming, non-pretensions and enjoyable. One my fave neighbourhood spots!"}
{"text":"normally i keep the good places under my hat but for the gluten free community i have to reveal this very nice dining spot i enjoyed tonight.

friendly and a warm welcome, good coffee [$2.50] and refills always a great way to start. (see my last review about coffees and clip joints.)

i also like that you can see into the kitchen behind the cash and it and the floors and stoves etc and staff were spotlessly clean. gotta love that.

and speaking of the cooking staff of which there were 2 or 3, they looked very professional in chef's uniforms. a nice touch considering a couple of buttons too many undone and hairy chests or cooking spattered white aprons are de rigueur on the danforth.
 
i started with the hummus, not the kind of consistency i like, smoother would be nice but the garlic and oil was nice and i was very happy with the sourdough crisps that came with it. very carby but a once in a while treat.

my entree was the moroccan meatball soup. very nicely spiced and i gotta say i did not finish it. a very nice serving size and priced reasonably and a welcome find on the danforth. i'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm very happy with this great neighborhood addition. They use quality ingredients (lots organic and free range options). Menu is simple yet delicious. Definitely will be one of our regulars!!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place for the neighbourhood! Awesome thoughtful service with simple high quality food prepared the right way. Free delicious coffee refills much appreciated too!"}
{"text":"Halloumi pizza was good and has almost enough cheese. It looks small but was filling. My friend loved his gluten free falafels. There are little extras on the plate which add to the overall taste. They have no pop so he settled for a vanilla roibos tea which was fine. I had a glass of wine. Five ounces for $12. It was a blend. I was told it was dry but it had gewurtztraminer in it. Not dry. And small. 
Other than the slightly overpriced drinks it was worth it and I would go again. Service very attentive."}
{"text":"Not sure why I've never tried this restaurant because it's bang  opposite my place of work close by the Big Carrot and it has been open for at least six months. I must be living in a fog because I have walked past it many times. This time, the sidewalk sandwich board caught my attention with the announcement of Moroccan Meatball Soup. Sounded like just what I needed.

It's a small restaurant that seats, I would guess, about 30 people. I was there shortly before 3 pm so service was not a problem.

The Moroccan Meatball Soup was how I wanted it to be and more: hearty, flavoured with cumin, oregano and other subtle spices that I could not quite pinpoint. There was also the dynamic of something crunchy such  as a twist of toasted bread that made this soup supremely divine. 

I looked breifly at their brunch menu and that looks like a pleasant change from the usual Saturday and Sunday brunch fare available everywhere. 

Yes, I'm a fan and can't wait to visit again so that can see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"It was one of the best brunches I've had!! First time I went I had the full English breakfast, it was amazing! The beans were homemade, and tasted like the Heinz British-style baked beans! They also had gluten free bread which was very tasty. My boyfriend had the mushrooms on toast.. I think he ate it in 8.2 seconds he loved it so much. Second time I went I had the mushroom on toast.. I've never had mushrooms so good! The poached eggs on top was the perfect combination. 
We had a chance to speak with the owner who was extremely kind. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch today and it was Amazing! Really friendly service, we both had the huevos y chorizo and it was phenomenal. The homemade chorizo was to die for and the presentation was excellent. Everything homemade, hormone and antibiotic free and from local producers, which makes it even better."}
{"text":"Delicious Levantine style food that will keep me coming back for more. The service is excellent, the beer list has something for everyone and the food will put a smile on your face. We shared the Kale salad, the Beet salad, Falafel plate, Haloumi pizza and Moujendra. Everything had unique flavours and is made with locally sourced, often organic ingredients. The chef is from Cyprus via London and her passion for great tasting healthy food shines bright on the Danforth."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot and a welcome addition for the celiac/gluten free crowd. Everything on the menu is clearly marked for GF and the chef really knows her stuff. 

Family friendly place - we bring the kiddo for brunch. Coffee and service are good and the brunch options have enough variety to keep us coming back."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! The ambiance, service and food are all top notch. You can definitely tell the ingredients they use are super fresh. Rikkochez is such an amazing addition to the neighbourhood and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for brunch in this restaurant today. The food was great. I do not mind the wait because I know they are making is fresh. The restaurant is clean. The portion they should make a little bit bigger."}
{"text":"I totally loved the Shakshuka, which was eggs and beef meatballs in a spicy tomato and roasted red pepper sauce, served with grill toast. The spiciness was spot on and the edition of the beef meatballs was amazing. I honestly couldn't get enough. I did not feel full but was satisfied. I plan to return and try the Kedgeree which is smoked fish with spiced basmati and hard boiled egg and labneh. This place does not have boring flavors so let your palate sing"}
{"text":"Eat here. Just do it. 

You won't be disappointed.

Cute small atmosphere, great service and moreover incredible food!! 

Just moved into the neighborhood and this was a great introduction!!"}
{"text":"I loved it.  happened on this Middle Eastern gem  the first evening it opened for dinner which was quite a test but its a great addition, and nice change for the Danforth strip. 
The food was from the pages of Jerusalem's Otto Lenghi. authentic, simple, flavourful,  unique. , sustainable. 1/2 vegetarian, 1/2 meat based.
Beautiful salads,  appetizers ,dips and grains.   Dreamy, creamy labneh, my sausage came on a bed of course flavorful hummus.  Owners are working with their homeland flavors of  Cyprus, Syria, French Lebanon,  Tasteful hand cut tables and surroundings.  Definitely will be taking friends back.. to work my way through the menu."}
