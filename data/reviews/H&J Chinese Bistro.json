{"text":"Ok Yelpland... here goes my first review!  ****  The only place I'm allowed to order Chinese food from!  H&J Chinese bistro left a menu in our mailbox not too long ago. While the menu looked intriguing, it took a while to take the plunge and order, mostly because my girlfriend doesn't like Chinese food, at all. However, after an epic powder day at Lake Louise that left her too tired to resist, I was finally able to talk her into trying it.   I am writing this review after our second sampling of their tasty food. That by itself should tell you how much we enjoyed it. It is true, it's now the only Chinese place I'm allowed to order from.  Service-wise, both times the food arrived sooner than the time given on the phone, and the dishes were prepared with fresh tasty ingredients, not at all greasy, and everything was absolutely delicious. This is most definitely my favorite Chinese take out in the city, by a long shot.  Of note are the pork dumplings, some of the best we've ever had, the Kung Po chicken, and the beef with black bean sauce.   I realize that 5 stars is a lot to give, but keep in mind I am rating this against other Chinese take out places, not fine dining establishments like Rouge or La Brezza. As such, the 5 stars are very much deserved, and I look forward to my next sampling from this great little restaurant."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and then i noticed it was new owners within 2 weeks! The service was great! The food was ok the dumplings were great! The food here is more on the spicy side so, be careful for some this is not warm heat but it's also not that hot that will burn your mouth. I love the marinated beef (cold plate) but now they mix it with beef tripe, which is ok but i would of liked it more if it was just beef. They call it beef tendons, but it was more beef with a little tendons in it. however instead of sweet savoury....Now its spicy. I liked the old way better. The jellyfish was just ok, not my fave. Worth checking out, i was told the new owners are from Toronto/London, Ontario. The chef has been a pro cook for 20+ years."}
{"text":"Ah, delicious Americanized-Chinese food, how I love you. I am not giving this restaurant 5-stars based on authenticity, but rather that the 'Chinese' food is absolutely delicious and well priced and fresh.  I almost don't want to write a review of this place yet as I have only gotten take out a couple of times and I still want to have a sit down meal soon. From the looks of it, there is another menu (aka authentic menu) but as I am generally n a hurry on my way home, I just go with the things I know. Therefore, once I'm able to actually go back and try a couple of more things, I might add a few things.   Anyway, onto the food. As I said, I am rating this place compared to other inexpensive/take-out Chinese-style places. Usually, you get these dishes that are covered in sauce and not cooked well and have no flavor. That is NOT the case here. The rice is friend perfectly (i.e. lightly fried in a flavorful oil, my guess is a sesame blend) and then mixed with your choice of meat - I highly recommend the BBQ. It was full of flavor and very moist.   I have gotten the ginger chicken, fried rice, house special friend rice, and spring roll, the wonton soup, the scallion pancake, and the sautéed vegetables. All of it was delicious and well made. Nothing was over friend and I have gone away from both meals very satisfied.   In general, the one person combo meals is about $13 and comes with a choice of two entrees, a spring roll, and soup. The dinner for two gets you another thing of soup, another spring roll, and a great variety of entrée choices. That comes to about $25 so it makes sense. When you order at the restaurant, it takes about 10-15 minutes, so not bad at all for super fresh take-out.   There are quite a few tables in the restaurant, some with lazy Susan's, and it seems like a great place to go with a group as there is plenty of room for a larger party. So all-in-all a pretty versatile place as they even offer free delivery in the area for all orders over $30."}
