{"text":"Nice to find a traditional Scarborough establishment.  A place that has been around longer than me!  They still cook old school, like the way it was back in the 1950's with lots of butter to fry your egg.  My friend and I stopped by last Saturday in the late afternoon so there were no crowds. Decor from decades ago, but the place was clean.  Ordered coffee $2.15 (got one top up) and \"Eggs\" which was 3 eggs with potatoes. The price after breakfast hours was $8.45  . The Eggs and Sausage was $10.45, comes with 4 links of sausage.  When the toast came out, it was glistening in good ole butter!  The way I used to butter my toast when i was a kid!   Friendly service.  But like the other reviews said, fairly pricey for such a basic breakfast.  It is a place you want to try out at least once to say you've done it and then maybe come back after a few years for the novelty. . Although for nostalgia, I hope the place does stay open for many more years to come."}
{"text":"Although I live in Markham it is always worth the drive into Toronto to enjoy a great breakfast at the Wexford. From the moment you walk in and receive a friendly greeting you should realize service like the Wexford is certainly a lost art. Once seated the coffee starts to pour and attentive service just seems automatic here.  The wait staff like the owners that great you are friendly, genuinely seem to care that your visit to this restaurant is a pleasant one and always seem to get the orders just right. The kitchen puts out the food cooked to order and  in good time.The portions are generous and the quality of their dishes becomes apparent with your first bite.  I think the Wexford provides an excellent breakfast at a fair price in this day and age when people look for value for their money. I wish we had such a place in Markham but have no problem driving into Toronto to get my awesome breakfast fix!  Here's to another 50 years!   John Egsgard Markham, ON."}
{"text":"Came in to Wexford's looking for a late lunch early dinner. First glance, the d√©cor is retro. Overall the cleanliness was satisfactory, could have been dusted and needed a vacuum. This place serves freshly squeezed orange juice. Outside sign says, \"over 6 billion oranges squeezed.\" The menu says, \"over 3 billion oranges squeezed.\" The bar sign says, \"over 2.5 billion oranges squeezed.\" Kind of annoying. The old numbers should be updated. We opted not to get breakfast, since this place is known for great breakfasts we wanted to see if the rest of the menu was up to par. We ordered the beef hot plate and chicken souvlaki. The beef hot plate was sloppy. It didn't really taste that fresh, beef was dry and veggies were frozen. The souvlaki wasn't too bad. The bread had just begun to go slightly stale. However the tomatoes and lettuce were fresh, the chicken was cooked well and not greasy at all. It was topped with the perfect amount of tzatziki. Not a bad dish, however there is much better souvlaki offered in the area. After both entrees, a 20% tip and two canned drinks total was $34. The server was very friendly and attentive. She was knowledgable of the menu and really sold the items well. I would've given this place 1 star had the server not been so great. My recommendations for this place, do a slight overhaul. Keep the nostalgic, retro look. I love the fact that this place has been around for so long and all the pictures on the walls and memorabilia give it a cozy feel. But clean the place up a bit and cut down your menu drastically. There are way to many items. It's actually overwhelming with so many options. Keep the breakfast menu, but ditch frozen foods and unpopular dishes. I probably won't go back unless I see some marketing for an overhaul."}
{"text":"We go for the breakfast. The guys up front always greet you warmly and give you a newspaper. The wait staff are pleasant and attentive. The food portions are generous and just the way I like. Guess I'm old fashioned. So be it!"}
{"text":"The Wexford Diner is a nice little place to go to for the average person that likes to have breakfast no matter what time of the day it is.  I don't recommend it, if you're overly health conscience, as it does tend to be somewhat on the greasy side.  The decor is that of your typical diner with old pictures of Wexford Village and Scarborough from back in the day that adorn the walls.  I found the staff to be quite pleasant and attentive, someone often came around to ask us if we would like some more coffee.  It was an overall pleasant experience and not to hard on the wallet."}
{"text":"Lived 5 minutes away from here since I was born 22 years ago, Still amazing food scarborough loves you!"}
{"text":"if you enjoy old chausky memoriabillia, very dried burger and over priced bacon ($3.00 f/3strips) accomp. over cooked burger that needs to be drenched with condiments for palability.  Covered/sandwiched by a cheap crumbling tasteless  expired BUN. W/ fries. ( not very memorable, even macdonalds fries tasted better !!! )  1 tea.  A waitress who is intrusive, down to getting paid for the bill. Really wanted a  decent breakfast, but it would have cost over $10 Bucks + t.&t., not worth it.   Local &  Even cliental look down and out.  The rent should not be expensive, in fact they are the Landowners of the strip mall!? !?  Mall needs to be sold and redeveloped because its sad state of affairs.  I guess  that is Scarborough at least the lower half is.  SO SAD..  T/t ~$ 12.00"}
{"text":"Breakfast was good with generous portion. coffee refill was nonstop. Eggs and pancakes were cooked nicely. I really liked their Home fries that  comes with the  breakfast order .The coffee mug was tall with big handle ( 4 fingers grip). they serve fresh farm eggs and you can feel the taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"This is a great local Scarborough establishment.  The wheat cakes (pancakes) are fantastic and the service is really wonderful. A great breakfast place that opens at the crack of dawn.  The family-run establishment has been around for many years.Despite its aw-shucks kind of environment, the prices are actually high.  Nevertheless, it's worth coming here at least once as there aren't very many places like this in the city, or anywhere for that matter."}
{"text":"This place has expired!!  Where do you pay $17 for one, yes that's one breakfast and two coffees ++ tip.   The poached eggs are watery, the peameal bacon way overdone, the french fries greasy undercooked and smell of fish.  The seating uncomfortable and place is not the \"kitchy\" thing they are trying to present.  The Breakfast is comparable to what you would cook at home when you have a raging hangover  really don't care, just need food & grease."}
{"text":"This is an iconic place in Scarborough restaurants. It's been around for over 50 plus years serving great breakfast all day long.  The service is excellent, but definitely over priced."}
{"text":"We came in for breakfast and for a little piece of Toronto history. Breakfast being served all day is a bonus, especially for those who work shift and want that ALL IMPORTANT MEAL any time they wish. The selection is normal and not anything out of the ordinary plus the prices are a little high for my liking but not unreasonable. Portion sizes are exactly what you're paying for, nothing more. To me, this is a regular diner that's a good size, with very courteous/helpful staff but nothing to write home about. And something different from a Timmies breakfast sandwich! We'll be back."}
{"text":"I love a good diner.  This one's not the highest on the great greasy spoons of the world scale, but it's got a certain charm that grabs me.    You're gonna get a good honest breakfast, friendly and efficient service, and an old-timey ambiance that is kind of comforting.  This is a great place to go with the fellas for a big breakfast and to tell some stories.  They'll keep pouring the coffee till you finally leave."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I ate at this restaurant, it was clean and I was offered coffee the second I sat down. I was offered a complimentary orange juice and that was also delicious. My problem was with how fast my food came out.  It took about 2 minutes which makes me think it wasn't that fresh. I had the bacon with scrambled eggs with a side of rye and my husband ordered a peameal bacon sandwhich. The bacon seemed under cooked on my plate but my husband sandwich was peameal bacon on a bun and that's it. No toppings no cheese and it was thrown on a plate with no sides at all. After the food was dropped off to us we didn't see our waitress again, nobody checked on us at any point. The restaurant was empty besides a table of ten that seemed to require a lot of attention.  After finishing we got the bill, Our total came to $30.00 for a simple breakfast and bacon on bread with 2 coffees with no offers of a refill. I will not return to this restaurant nor will I recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Been there too long. Tired and out of touch. Greasy spoon - yes but way over-priced. Uncomfortable booth seating. My french toast was dry in the middle. My husband likes to breakfast here but I won't go again."}
{"text":"Use to be good back in the day but they are getting ahead of themselves now. Only one can make breakfast but at those prices come on. Done with this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Great juice. Decent food. Mediocre price.  We were seated immediately, and our food was on the table within a few minutes of ordering. They did the eggs perfectly (sunny side up and over hard). The orange juice was superb, per their advertising. I enjoyed the breakfast sausage; they had an unusual but excellent flavor. The coffee is diner standard: forgettable but goes down like water.   Breakfast for two came to about $40 - this is my only complaint.  The portions and quality were just fine - but they asked for a rather premium price.  Would I go again? Definitely. Would I go often? I'm not that rich ;)"}
{"text":"First time here today. We finished at Sunnybrook and made our way over here for breakfast. We had time to kill before Costco opened.  We walked in and we greeted by smiling faces. Told to sit wherever we wanted.  Restaurant is from 1958. It's preserved in great condition. I love the old fabric on the booths and the wooden decor throughout. My dad would love it.  The lady serving us was so sweet and attentive. Breakfast came out fast!!! Food was good. I got the peameal bacon with one egg and home fries. The potatoes were good but not the best I've had. I got two eggs on my plate which was a nice surprise. I couldn't finish my plate. Id rather have paid less and gotten a smaller plate because I really hate wasting food. A gentleman came over and gave us two glasses of freshly squeezed orange juice. That was unexpected and so sweet. It was really good.  Two peameal breakfasts, (1 with 3 eggs, 1 with 1 egg), and two coffees $33 with tax before tip. Seemed kind of high for breakfast but we said we'd return."}
{"text":"I went to this place looking for a clean and breakfast joint near my appointment.  The people are friendly and service is great but the place is very outdated and horrible ventilation system.  One thing I hate the most, is to come out run errands after and smell like grease and fried food. As for food, I ordered the typical breakfast: eggs and sausage, it was good but the PANCAKES taste funky and it cost $16!! and it wasn't good.  I only had one bite.  Will never come back here again. Overpriced, food is too greasy and not good, place looks so outdated and need maintenance especially their ventilation system.   If you're a foodie like me, this is not a place to go."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience here when I went for lunch.  Their lunch menu is overpriced, and an absolute low quality meal.  The place is really dingy inside, and looks run down.  Save your buck and yourself the disappointment!"}
{"text":"After watching the local indie film 'Wexford Plaza' (see my Carlton Cinemas review), it reminded me that I hadn't been to the Wexford Restaurant for a long time, so this was my breakfast stop yesterday morning. There is a large mural of farm life outside on the west wall, probably a reference to their farm-fresh-eggs slogan, and a good-sized patio out front. I sat in one of the booths near to the eating counter, and I must say that those seats are getting a bit worn. There are lots of sports photos and plaques along that wall, many of them of the Toronto Maple Leafs from days gone by. There is more seating on the other side of the counter, with nicer wooden tables and chairs. The service was quite friendly and fairly fast considering it was busy at the time.  I ordered the french toast, which was 3 thick pieces of toast, with a big dollop of butter and pancake syrup. It was very good, a nice golden-brown colour, and just crisp at the edges. It could also have been cinnamon toast for an extra $3. Their coffee cups are larger than most diners, and the coffee was nice and hot. Their menu is fairly standard for breakfast fare, (farm-fresh) eggs and meat, omelettes, and their freshly squeezed orange juice (\"over 3 billion oranges squeezed\"). There is also a separate lunch menu, but I have only ever had breakfast there. Overall, the food is good and portions are large, but prices for some plates are $1-2 more than other comparable places. My bill was about average at $14."}
{"text":"I've moved away from the area therefore haven't had the opportunity to come for breakfast as often as I used to.  We were in the area today and decided to stop in, which is literally what we did.  We sat down and looked over the menu and were shocked at their prices.  $12 for pancakes - really??  Bacon & eggs $11 +.    It's a wonder the place was dead - one other customer.    We left.  This place used to be a legacy in Scarborough.  Obviously not anymore due to their unrealistic prices.  There is no real craft to making a great breakfast and many other restaurants realize that and charge accordingly.  Wexford - get real with your pricing."}
{"text":"I have been there many times and the family members that run it are very friendly.  The food is on par with any other good to great diners but the prices are way too high."}
{"text":"I don't think dogs would eat that food! Absolute garbage in my books!! Worst experience ever! Negative 800 stars."}
{"text":"The breakfast is pretty good, I love the homefries and the portions are huge but the prices are hotel restaurant high."}
{"text":"So -by the time I walked in to the time I was served was about 20 mins. That's just too long for me. There were servers on their phones and to be honest I was just blatantly ignored.   The food though was good. Ordered the classic sub and it did not fail. Overpriced for sure for what it was but whatcha gonna do.   If it was $4 less, I could have accepted the price and lived with the crappy service. They were at 50% occupancy so there's really no excuse for the poor service.   All I wanted was yummy food. The club sandwich was actually pretty good. The fries were a bit stale, life soft and drenched in oil.   All in all I would go here again but maybe at a slower time to experience the difference in service."}
{"text":"We went to Wexford Restaurant in search of a hearty breakfast to start our day and that's exactly what we got.    The ambiance is a cool mixture of old diner meets family restaurant (I tend to dislike minimalist chic) and the service is very efficient.  We ordered wheat cakes and a breakfast platter with home fries, sausage, fried eggs and toasts.  As the restaurant claimed to have very good coffee, we ordered a cup of black coffee along with a jug of freshly squeezed orange juice to go with our meal.    The coffee was as I expected...not very good.  It was way too watery for my taste but those who like lots of cream and sugar in their coffee may enjoy this coffee.  The freshly squeezed OJ was good but on the steep size (a 750 ml jug was over $13).  The rest of our breakfast was well executed, arrived hot on the table and exactly the way we had ordered.  I have to say that their wheat cake portion is laughably large so it'd be a good idea to share it with someone.    All in all, Wexford Restaurant's breakfast was exactly what we were looking for without being over the top or under-whelming.  Will probably revisit if we're in the area for breakfast."}
{"text":"Just came back from this restaurant for the first time and it was alright I guess (waitress was very friendly) Eggs were sooo watery, portions were tiny ( this plate cost $12) plus 2 slices of toast. Didn't have high expectations but the restaurant needs an upgrade. I get that they're hanging on to it being over 60 years old original everything but come on... its 2018 now and there should be at least 1 bathroom stall you can use at an establishment that hasn't been s***t all over the seats.. ahem anyway yeah dear Wexford please upgrade guys it's time"}
{"text":"Worst experience in a breakfast place I have ever had... My bread was moldy! Yum, and the service was terrible. Stay away."}
{"text":"Open since 1958, this place has a classic feel to it, although parts have been refurbished (maybe some 80's in there too?). Booth was cramped so we opted for the table with chairs.   The breakfast was OK, nothing special. I had the bacon and eggs (w/ potatoes, toast) - potatoes and eggs were plain, but bacon saved it. The OJ was nice and fresh.  Waitress was friendly enough. Price was so-so; ~$10 for the bacon & eggs.   Overall, if you want that vintage vibe then might be worth a look, but there are better and cheaper places out there."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for ten years and the food is always good but lately the prices are getting much to expensive.  Example: BLT sandwich with a side of fries and coffee plus taxes was just over $21 today.  A bit much I think  I love the servers here, always very friendly but I will have to think twice and check my budget before I come back again!"}
{"text":"From the outside, this seemed like it would be a good old greasy spoon and I was looking forward to a good cheap diner breakfast. However, we never got around to eating because the prices made me lose my appetite. A grilled cheese for $7 that doesn't come with any sides!? A $20 salad!?! We ended up just getting a coffee and leaving. I do not recommend and will never go again. They made it 60 years but with their greedy high prices, I'll be surprised if they make it another 5 years."}
