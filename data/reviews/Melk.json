{"text":"Food: 4/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Price: 3.5/5  I arrived at a good time; there was only one customer in front of me so I was served pretty quickly. After I took a seat, a huge storm of customers came in and lined up all the way to the front door! Don't believe me? Go see it for yourself  - the cafe at its busiest peak can have you waiting longer than your average cafe, but the line moves relatively fast and you will have your drink in no time.  The cafe serves 49th Parallel coffee just like they do at the original location, so if you're a fan of 49th Parallel, you'd be glad to know that it's here. I'm not the hugest fan, so I opted for a mochaccino and an apple scone to go along with it. MELK is known very much for their scones, and on a busy day, I've heard that they sell out very quickly! Indeed, I was the last person who grabbed the apple scone when I visited... there were so many delicious flavours that I really couldn't decide (Strawberry, peach, apple, cheese, etc.) so I let my instincts do the deciding (the last one standing duh).  Anyway, if you're a fan of light roast coffee, you'll definitely like the coffee here. My mochaccino was great, but as I'm not the biggest fan of light roast coffee, it wasn't my favourite. Next time, I'll order their chai latte. The cafe has a great set of tea options as well if you're a tea drinker like me!  My scone was very crispy on the outside but ever so soft on the inside. I really like how there were big chunks of apple inside my scone which added lots of texture and overall flavour to it. The scone was relatively big in size as well, similar to the size you find at Starbucks, but more delicious of course! I'd definitely come back to MELK and try a few more of their flavours.  I liked how I could help myself to water. It was convenient and it made my stay at MELK much better. It's little things like this that I really appreciate! Overall, the cafe was very well kept - clean, tidy and very photo-worthy. A quick search on Instagram and you're bombarded with beautiful pictures of latte art from MELK #mtlcafecrawl.  Anyhow, if you're the district for whatever reason, you should definitely check it out if you like being on top of your Montreal cafes. I'm not sure if they have wifi, as I didn't see it appear on my laptop. I didn't bother asking as I didn't need it, but it'll be great if they have it! Even though I don't particularly like 49th Parallel Coffee, MELK Bar à Café is still one of my go-to cafes purely for their baked goods and its coffee vibes!  Nevertheless, it's a great place to stop by for a quick caffeine fix, and it's definitely a very nice and needed addition in the neighbourhood - Starbucks and Second Cup were pretty much the only options!"}
{"text":"Best cappuccino I've had in a while. Scones are delicious and the yogurt parfait is killer."}
{"text":"Tiny, but beautiful little spot (I love their tiles!)  tucked away on Stanley. It's on my morning commute from the train station to school and I love it. Delicious coffee and for a tiny bit more they offer almond or soy milk, which if I'm recalling correctly is one more choice than Myriade offers. Kinda tiny so not somewhere I would necessarily study but great and fast for a coffee pickup. Also, the cumin scone I had was awesome and their other sweets look amazing too!"}
{"text":"Small little shop but had myself a delicious iced latter and an even better chocolate and blueberry scone."}
{"text":"Best latte I have ever had! Holy smokes!!!   How can something I order all the time taste so much better here?!?  Plus they started off my day with classic DMX \"B*^#h Get Out The Way\" lol!!!  Definitely stop by!!!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely little cafe with a great atmosphere. The staff was extremely nice. I had a vanilla latte (the syrup is apparently home-made) and a apple-cinnamon scone. Both were great. The scone was lovely and crisp on the outside, yet nice and moist in the inside. The price was actually quite low, especially for the quality you get."}
{"text":"Sweet little cafe. I had the jasmine tea which was very high quality and a chocolate chunk cookie that was the perfect blend of sweet with just a touch of salty."}
{"text":"Lovely, airy cafe with a delicious cold brew and homemade scones. The servers were polite and good with questions. My only minor complaint is just that a prominent photograph really clashes with the mood of the space. Otherwise, a great spot."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Melk. They have a great indie vibe inside with gorgeous windows and natural lighting. I like the wooden tables they have as well as the gorgeous marble tables. I love that all the tables are square. One of my favorite things are square tables to work on instead of circular ones.   The only downside is that this cafe has no wifi like many sit down places in Montreal and there is a high amount of traffic through the cafe on a busy afternoon.   They have a great selection of drinks and I had an amazing matcha green tea latte. I'm not always an espresso in the afternoon kind of person so it's good to have alternatives.   Overall a great place to grab coffee with a friend or take a breather off the busy St. Catherine's traffic when shopping. Would come back with friends in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"If you find yourself downtown and in need of a coffee type beverage, this place is a great option.  Delicious cold brew.  Fine espresso.  A few little snacks.  Lovely folks running the place."}
{"text":"So I was staying at the Sheraton around the corner and went around town every morning to find a new and amazing breakfast place. Thankfully, I finally decided to come by on my last day and I had only wish I had come here earlier.  I ordered a CHAI latte... oh I still miss you so much. I hate it when I get a chai latte that doesn't have that \"chai kick\" to it, this chai latte had the right amount of kick and hit the right spot. I've tried many chai lattes in the last three years in various places with very few that are good, but this one was great!  If you don't drink tea/coffee, you still need to stop here to try the SCONES. There is no clotted cream and no it is not warm and toasty when you get it, but they must make the best cheddar scones ever. I will definitely come back in the future to try ALL their scones!   I'm beating myself up for forgetting my phone that morning and consuming everything before I could get back to it."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at how much I like this place! Came by on a Sunday afternoon to work a bit. The service was super fast since there weren't that many people there, but eventually the traffic picked up within the hour. I got a large iced americano, which was light and refreshing. Still feeling caffeinated a few hours later, which is definitely a plus for me.   When I was working, they were playing the entire Enrique Inglesias Insomniac album, which was a great throwback. The music volume was a bit loud, but I had headphones, so it wasn't a big deal. Like mentioned in other reviews, there was no wifi, which I actually liked since it meant fewer distractions.   In general, the space was great for working. The square tables, natural lighting, and comfortable seats created the perfect environment. The scones were super tasty too!"}
{"text":"Went in with an indie coffee passport my lady gave me.  Solid coffee drink, nice and comfortable decor, all great.    A nice find in otherwise depressing and to commercial area part of Montreal."}
{"text":"Being a non-coffee drinker, I often search for the best place for a delicious well made hot cocoa. Or if in the mood, a lovely cup of tea. Melk is a place I've heard quite a bit of positive things about, and I'm all about small independent coffee shoppes instead of Starbucks or Second Cup. However! Melk in this particular location(Stanley St.) Was nothing else but a disappointment. My friend and I have arrived on a Friday at 4:00pm. The place was empty, and the variety of baked goods was poor. Only three things left. Two scones and a gluten free lemon mini bundt cake. I emphasize the word \"mini\" Just two bites. Luckily for me it was the perfect amount due to a heavy lunch we had a few hours before.  The blueberry & chocolate chip scone that my friend ordered, was a good size of what it look like a pile of sawdust, with one blueberry and one chocolate chip. We had to search for them!  We  were informed that their baked goods are baked daily in house. Are they?? That's still very questionable to me!  Luckily, Melk earned one more star than they should have. Simply, and only because the hot chocolate was amazing! Creamy, not overly sweet, and with the right amount of sweetness to contrast the dark chocolate(You may choose dark or milk) I love dark chocolate! Along with a small marshmallow square. Which was delicious. Along with the fact that their staff was very friendly, and kind.   As for their baked goods... I highly recommend you pass on them.  Both the scone and lemon bundt cake were dry and stale. Freshness is not a word I would use for either one of them. As for the taste, it was just \"OK\" but not pronounced.   One other thing that surprised me a great deal and turned me off the most, is their bathroom. Go ahead.. Look at me strange or laugh. As I explain why.. You may feel the same way as I did.  Melk is situated right next to a underground parking. Go along with me here. As I sat down while waiting for my friend, I looked around and no bathroom was to be found. Which is a HUGE no no for any facility that serves food.  Out of curiosity, I've decided to ask where is their bathroom. One of their staff members decides to open their side door that leads into the parking lot. Yes, that's right! You must go through a greasy, big smokey parking lot to use a washroom. Both the parking lot and Melk share the same bathroom!  Having said all this. If ever I have a craving for a hot cocoa while I'm walking by Melk, I will go in and out and grab just that. I will not be spending time or money to enjoy a pastry of theirs, since there is nothing enjoyable about them.   I haven't been to their Monkland location(Yet!) However! I've been highly recommended by other Yelp foodies to go to their other location instead. Gladly!"}
{"text":"My husband & I are visiting Canada for the first time from the US. Melk was close to our hotel. The scones were as good as people are saying - we started out with one and went back for another! The vanilla latte was great as well. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, quality product. We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"BEST COFFEE PLACE!!! That is all I have to say, nice little shop on Stanley Street, 2 minutes away from René-Lévesque and Saint-Catherine Streets.   The coffee is the best I ever had, I always order a 12oz Vanilla Latte, I take it hot in the winter and cold on nice summer days. The way they heat their milk is awesome, it's like drinking a cloud and the coffee is delicious and strong so you are ready to confront your day.  They serve coffee to go and offer maybe 10 places to sit down inside. They sell some good cookies and scones. You could also buy some coffee from the shop, coffee beans or ground coffee."}
{"text":"Wonderful little coffee shop. I was in Montreal for 5 days and came here every day. Their espresso is top notch and so are their baked goods, I don't think you could go wrong with any of their options. I had a couple of their sweet scones and one of their savory scones, I think it was red pepper and feta. So good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Amidst the towers of downtown Montreal, you will find this great little coffee bar. Full of charm, followed by a great espresso!   Great job on the branding an creating an atmosphere where you want to hang out in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"It is a hard one to rate, because the number of stars really depends on one's purpose for visiting the café, and comparable options in the neighborhood. As for me, I went there to get a little work done on my laptop while enjoying a morning snack in a nice atmosphere. Because I happened to be downtown, it was a good option: the latte was OK (not the best in town for my taste), and I was really happy with the many options for snacks (i.e., fresh baked goods) especially given the limited space they have. I had a strawberry vanilla scone, and I enjoyed it. Friendly service, and nice decor. But when I set up to work, I decided not to sit by the front window because the view was not very nice. Then, the noise level both from the street and from the music was so high that I wondered if I could concentrate on my work. Later on, the noise went down but the AC was a bit too high (glad I had a sweater). I did not see any wifi but I did not enquire about it because I did not really needed it. Overall, because this café is in a business district, with a clientele mostly made up of workers who grab their coffee and go, it might be the best option in the area for that purpose (certainly bettern than a generic Starbuck or Tim Horton's). But I would not go out of my way to go work there; better options are available in the Plateau, Mile End, Rosemont, and Villeray."}
{"text":"Discovered this tiny little cafe next to my hotel and it was love at first sip!  The branding, the menu and the atmosphere are all very appealing, and the vanilla latte was likely one of the best I've ever had.  I went back the same afternoon for a pick-me up during what was a long work day, and the barista suggested adding a homemade marshmallow to my latte... it was like icing on the cake!    If I come back to Montreal, I'll be sure to check out the original melk, as it sounds like it's even better..."}
{"text":"I am still dreaming about my chia seed pudding and the best vanilla latte that I have ever had in my life! This place was incredibly busy but so worth it!  I had heard that Montreal had incredible coffee and I was not disappointed at all. My vanilla latte was so delicious. I savored every sip. It was also really beautiful! And much to my surprise, I ordered a mango chia seed pudding for my breakfast and it was perfect. The texture was so awesome! Not too \"milkey\" and not too thick. It was perfect!  I arrived right before the lunch rush and was thankful I could find a seat to enjoy myself. I enjoyed my latte and my chia seed pudding and people watched for over an hour. I went back every day during my stay in Montreal. It's a hidden gem and a must try if you are visiting this area!"}
{"text":"A cute little café with many coffee options as well as a selection of baked goods. The scones were amazing, with a great crunchy top! It's very small inside, so keep that in mind if you plan to eat in. I got my order to go, and was able to get my order quickly. The staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great coffee, great independent coffee bar feel. Light and clean. Cute name. I'll be here every day while in Montreal.  Oh yeah, and it's slightly cheaper than Starbucks - hard to beat that!"}
{"text":"Great spot for coffee! Short, short walk from the Sheraton Hotel. The cheddar cheese and green onion scones are yummy and awesome americanos. Chia pudding will be my next try. Try the hot chocolate with home made marshmallows ! Relaxing spot for a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Lovely small space. Good soy latte. Very friendly staff. Cool art on the walls. Nicely designed tables."}
{"text":"While staying in Montreal, I tried to find different coffee shops daily. I loved this one- it wasn't in the metro & it was delicious!"}
{"text":"OVER-priced. Ok, the convenience of specialty coffee across the street from the office but it's kinda expensive for the quality you get. I prefer a local roaster like Saint-Henri microtorréfacteur or Dispatch."}
{"text":"Location: At the bottom of Stanley near René-Lévesque. Street parking is \"available\" - I use that term loosely because the only time you'll find parking is probably late at night when there's no event on at the Bell Center! The closest subways are Peel (green line) and Lucien L'Allier (orange line) - I'd say Lucien L'Allier is the closest on foot.   The place: Tiny but popular! I discovered Melk when they originally opened in NDG and loved it. In 2015, I was driving (or walking - I forget) down René-Lévesque and spotted this location. It literally took me 3 years to check it out! And the reason I remember I first spotted them back in 2015 is because I was in the area for U2, which, coincidentally, is why I was around this time, too. Not that I'm a big U2 fan or anything... =-D  Anyway, these guys have some tables and bar-type seating but I'd say it's more of a to-go place that caters to the business crowd working in the area.   The goods: On morning 1, I ordered a Cortado and an Amaretto cookie, and on day 2, I ordered a latté and scone. In terms of coffee, YES. Great coffee - zero complaints, better than Starbucks, obviously. The scone was fantastic and stuffed my nicely on the morning after my 2nd U2 show. I don't remember the exact ingredients but it was of the savory variety and was totally delicious. The Amaretto cookie disappointed me though - the NDG variety is amazing but this one contained cranberries and well, the flavor profile was a bit off for me. My friends agree 100% that coffee here is top notch.  Service: Great. Staff is friendly and despite the fact that their mornings are pretty darn busy, they're pretty quick to take and prep orders.  Price point: They're on par with other 3rd wave spots - about $4-5 for a Latté.  Check it!"}
{"text":"A cute, tiny and cheap hidden gem.  I had a large macha latte and a apple/zucchini muffin.  Delicious!...  ...And affordable!  The matcha latte had this distinctive slightly bitter and gritty matcha taste and feel. It was vibrant and well balanced.  The muffin was definitely \"homemade\". I could only describe it has the muffin baby of a zucchini bread and apple crumble.  I could hear the delight of a table neighbour, trying the chocolate scone.  It was small but cosy."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop, soy latte was pretty good, matcha latte is fine - could have a slightly stronger matcha taste.   Yelp business hours are inaccurate - as of Oct 2017, the shop opens at 9am on weekend (not 8am!!!)  It was a bit annoying to trek over only to realize the shop is not yet open. The scones looked great, though we did not get to try."}
{"text":"Third wave, yes but not among the best. You have a better options close by in myriade. This is based on the Americano."}
{"text":"This place has delicious latte. The barista is very friendly, service is very fast. Th shop is small and very cozy . There isn't a lot if seating but there's so much to do around here I didn't mind taking it to go."}
{"text":"Probablement le meilleur chocolat chaud de Montréal! Petit endroit qui peut facilement passer inaperçu si tu ne sais pas c'est où. L'endroit est chaleureux et les choix sont variés. Si tu cherches une petite place intime, c'est l'endroit!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with the friendliest staff you'll find. Juice is pricey - but worth every cent. Small - so don't expect a lot of seating. 49th parallel coffee for sale.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A little bit expensive but one of the best coffee place in Montreal. I recommend this place for the coffee."}
{"text":"I only went here once during my trip to Montreal but was unimpressed. I ordered a cappuccino there and it simply didn't taste good. It tasted as if the coffee was old and the milk wasn't steamed enough. On top of that, it was overpriced. On a positive note, it seems like a quaint cafe to get some work done. I liked the decor a lot and I'm hoping my one cappuccino is atypical of the coffee here. Based off prior Yelp reviews, it seems like maybe I just had a bad cup. I'm thinking my one experience wasn't representative of the coffee and food at Melk."}
{"text":"Petit café indépendant au centre-ville. Je connaissais déjà son grand frère sur monkland et je dois dire que la qualité est la même. Personnel sympathique et décor charmant. J'ai pris un grand latte et une galette d'avoine et raison et je n'ai pas été déçu. J'y suis allée un jour de tempête a 14:00 et c'était presque désert. Pas de wifi êt pas de toilette. Parfait endroit pour une petite pause pendant le travail, le magasinage ou pour lire un peu avant de reprendre la route."}
{"text":"MELK is a really good spot to know about downtown- they have very high quality espresso-based drinks and lots of other little goodies. Good branding, too. A really good place to have a casual meeting or grab a latte on the go. Their only downside is rather limited seating though so don't assume that you will have a place to work or meet with several people.   MELK is also the most convenient place to find Detour beans in the downtown area, so come stock up."}
{"text":"Good latte, close to where I live, super nice decor, opens early.  However, their famous scone was so bland. I got the peach and pecan one, I couldn't taste the peach at all, it's like a piece of bread.  Maybe I will come by next timers have coffee and try their other pasties."}
{"text":"Cute cafe. Good matcha latte! It actually tastes like matcha and not super sweet. They even do latte art, too. They also have yummy baked goods and the baristas are nice."}
{"text":"Ordered a latte and a scone. The barista accidentally made an extra latte and gave it to me, A+ for service. The scones were good, and the latte had a good balance of sweetness. The inside is a little small, but other than that it is a pretty cozy spot to sit down. Would def come back and try out their other drinks on the menu."}
{"text":"Very good coffee spot for downtown working people. They also have excellent venoiseries."}
{"text":"A small but lovely coffee shop featuring delicious espresso drinks and a few pastries.  I had been in search of a really good cup of coffee in the area and Yelp pointed me in the direction of Melk. I had already eaten breakfast so I wasn't snacky but a caffeine kick was definitely necessary. When I arrived I was the only one in line on a Saturday afternoon so my trip here was brief but memorable.  The barista was super friendly and told me about a few drinks they offered. I didn't go crazy, just got a plain old latte, but it was probably the best coffee I had my entire time in Montreal. I usually buy beans when I go to a great coffee shop during my travels and I regret not getting a bag here, the coffee was that good. I just didn't want to carry them around with me that day. Stupid choice!   Pastries looked delicious but I passed on them. But I made a mental note of them while I was there for next time."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, I am in love with you Melk.  While staying in Montreal for a few days, Melk was recommended as a great spot to get coffee.  I stopped in on my last morning in Montreal, and was not disappointed.  What a perfect little place.  Small with only a handful of seats, I ordered a Cappuccino and a Chocolate & Cranberry Scone.  The cappuccino was hot and the scone quite frankly was the best I have ever had.  Sitting in the front window with a coffee and scone watching the snow fall was perfection.  When I get back to Montreal, this is top of my list!"}
{"text":"It's a small coffee shop located in downtown but away from hustle and bustle. I've only tried a cappuccino and it was one of the best that I've ever had. It could have been a five star coffee shop if they had wifi. It's a good place if you want to meet someone for a short chit chat, but not if you want to get some work done and need wifi."}
{"text":"Favorite matcha latte in Montreal. Regular lattes are also delicious. The scones never disappoint either!"}
{"text":"Thought for sure I would get a room temperature scone but it was surprisingly warm!!!  At 2pm!!!  They just made a fresh batch!  That made up for the fact that the cashier did know what was what. There were scones that were clearly blueberry but she tried to convince me it was orange and raisins, because that's what the sign says. I just pointed to the exact piece and said whatever that is. Turned out to be blueberry and chocolate. I took a star off because of this only because the staff should know what the are selling as people may have allergies.  This time they had a number of sweet rolls as well. Hard to choose but I was in need of the perfect scone which can only be found here. The latte was fantastic and while I was diligently Yelping away, my drink was brought to me by one of the staff that remembered me. It's been a while since I was here.  Man, I feel special.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Wish Melk was around when I worked in this area! They have a nice 3rd wave coffee that's for sure. Lovely cappuccino. Nutty. Pricing is fine vs value considering the area.  My main gripe were the treats they served. Quite expensive for what it is and they all had something unappealing! Raisins are why I have trust issues. Raisin cranberry muffins? Buy why? Apple + raisins. But why? Apple and zucchini? But why?  Went with their chocolate chip cookie and for $2.50 it left a lot to be desired. Not as fresh as I like them.  Place is quite small, very loud and ideal to grab a coffee and go. Staff is pretty quick so they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I've been to the NDG location of Melk and loved it but since that neighbourhood is out of my way I was very happy when a second Melk opened up downtown.  In this part of Montreal Starbucks and Second Cups abound so an alternative is always welcome.  It's just south of Ste Catherine and the space is pretty small but its the same high quality product as their NDG location.  They have a small selection of baked goods but they are one of those places that goes for quality over quantity.  My chocolate chip cookie was moist and fresh.  It was as good as any home-made product.  I also enjoyed my iced latte which wasn't bitter at all and was quite refreshing.  They don't have wi-fi which is really the only complaint I have.  I was here to do some work so internet would have been nice.  Apart from that though this is a an excellent option for coffee if you're in the downtown core"}
{"text":"Nouveau petit café indépendant adjacent au stationnement AutoParc Stanley sur la rue Stanley entre Ste-Catherine & René-Lévesque, petit frère du MELK sur Monkland dans N.D.G. Enfin, un petit café sympa dans ce coin du centre-ville qui sert du bon café. Clientèle d'affaires en quête de caféine.  Ils servent du café 49th parallel. Expresso de qualité (3,25$). Ils ont seulement des viennoiseries (muffins & biscuits), mais n'ont pas de sandwichs, à venir, selon la barista. Déco, simple & moderne. À savoir, pas de wifi & pas de toilettes.  5/5 visité en juin 2015."}
{"text":"It is a nice spot for grabbing a coffee in downtown, but it is a bit difficult to stay there for a long time because of the noise level and also because there's no wifi there. The space is relatively small and the price is fair enough. I am surprised when I tasted my green tea latte because it was much sweeter than the other places I have been before. I would say that it is not an ideal spot to study."}
{"text":"This is a great coffee place.  Many good choices--from Canadian roasters--not Italian coffee that sat on a boat for months.  Fresh, cold pressed juices.  It's small, but they focus on quality.  The baked goods looked great too."}
{"text":"The matcha latte was great! Not overly strong, a good balance of green tea, milk and sugar. I could definitely feel that they are using good tea. Also, I could see that they are using good coffee beans. I'm happy to find a small gem to hang out for a coffee in downtown.   Maybe, this place is not great to spend your hours browsing your laptop. Place is tiny and tables are small. It could be good for a short chitchat."}
{"text":"My go-to spot in Montreal for coffee / light breakfast!  Coffee is excellent - love the maple latte when I want a sweet treat but the americano is my trusty favourite  Also love getting a light breakfast - feta scone is amazing, also like the chia pudding (with tropical fruit compote)  Service is friendly, space is small but airy & bright, great vibe!"}
{"text":"My experience at Melk was more Meh. If only the coffee tasted as good or as strong as it smelled.   It's a good place to get decent coffee. But the welcoming aroma gets washed away by a rather bland pull."}
{"text":"Cozy coffee shop that was very heavily patronized by local business folks.  My coffee was fine, the service great and the atmosphere comfortable.  Nice to be out of the big chains once and again."}
{"text":"Le Melk est un des rares petit café avec de vrais Barista situé en plein centre ville ! En effet dans le CBD il est très difficile de pouvoir boire un café fait avec de bon produit par un véritable barista !   Bien sûre je ne parle pas des second cup, Tim's ou autre Van Houtte ! Ici le produit est mit en valeur avec un vrai artisan qui connaît son métier !! Comme dans tout café vous avez le choix entre différents types de café, Latte, espresso, cappuccino... je retrouve un peu la qualité de savoir faire que nous avions en Italie ou en Australie !!   Ce n'est pas les habitués qui vont vous dire le contraire! Goûter au café du Milk va changer littéralement vos habitudes ! Fini les cafés dans les grandes chaînes ! Ici c'est du véritable !   Vous pouvez y acheter aussi de bon produit ... Mais je n'ai pas essayer :)   En tout cas j'y reviendrai !"}
