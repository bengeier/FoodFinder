{"text":"Excellent service! Was done exactly how I wanted it to be. Very good place to go to for nail service!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is very friendly and FAST! Very professional but social and  the salon is very relaxed. By far my favorite place to get my nails done. The prices are more than fair the service is fast the nails last! I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Just happened to see this place when I needed my nails done. Ty did a great job and was very friendly the entire time. I am looking forward to getting my fills. I recommend the gels. They are great and dry immediately."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since this place has opened and I am SO impressed! Walked right in without an appointment and noticed the place was cozy and extremely clean. Also, don't be fooled by looks - Lee is phenomenal and probably the best nail tech I've ever been to!! I would recommend this location to anyone!"}
{"text":"Went in about an hour before they closed and was greeted by their friendly staff. I got the shellac manicure and my tech did a great job! Was in and out within 30 minutes. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I took my time to do some adequate research as far as nails go and this place had one of the best ratings. I called them to make an appointment because I wanted to get done right away, when I came in I was seen immediately. I initially requested Johnny because he had such great reviews, but I was told he didn't do full sets . Another guy did my nails and he did an OK job. My acrylic was too thick on my nails and the polish was a little bit uneven. Still loved the color though....just not what I expected."}
{"text":"Love this place! Thai, the owner, is awesome! My 5 yr old daughter and I come here for mommy daughter time all the time. Never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went for a full set and am happy with the result. Affordable price and nice staffs. Definitely give it a try. They accept walk ins but I would try to make an appt anyway."}
{"text":"I am traveling and found this salon by using Yelp.  It was clean, neat, and my Gel Manicure exceeded my expectations.  The nail technician listened to what I wanted and he shaped my nails perfectly and selected the color that met my needs.  Strongly recommend this salon."}
{"text":"I decided to treat my 12 year old daughters for their birthday and take them to get their nails done. I have to say my overall experience was great. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. My girls couldn't decide on a specific color and one of the employees took out the time to let them see samples and explain the difference between polishes. Thank goodness they did because I wouldn't have been able to. The girls got awesome color changing nails. Super cool. They were extremely happy with how they turned out.  My major concerns is both cleanliness, time, and price. All were great!   I wouldn't trust a dirty looking facility. It was very clean and well maintained. They seem to have a really good order to the store.   Even though the store was somewhat busy it seemed that they moved along pretty quick. I was actually surprised that it didn't take too long at all. I'm a strong believer in organization. The staffs representation of this was well executed.   Finally the bill. IT was a lot more reasonable and fair than I had initially anticipated. I had a specific budget to try and keep to and was well under it.   So once again I highly recommend this place. I've never had my nails done, not to say that I ever would, but I was kind of jealous of the foot massage and jacuzzi tub."}
{"text":"Okay the good and the bad. (And. Why even with some bad they're worth 4.5/5 stars) First off. My nails look good now. Hadn't had them done in two months (I get them done religiously).  The good   1. They close at 7. I called at 6:08 and was 2 minutes away and they were still willing to take me. I left at 7:10. They didn't rush through the process.  2. He did an amazing job shaping them (coffin shape), cleaning up my cuticles etc.    The bad  1. It cost me 70 before tip!! As we were going I wasn't asking how much things were costing. But he must have charged to shape them, more to clean up my cuticles. More for gel polish ($10 extra). It's really outrageous. But they look good i won't complain too much but for 70 I expect them to be perfect and they're not. So just tip ask how much everything is before you agree.  2. My other issue is that I kept saying I didn't want gel polish and I realize it's his job to upswell me but I told him I wasn't sure I would like the gel matte and I don't. I'm really unhappy with the \"matte\" look. I know I would have loved it with the regular color cause I do it all the time.  My nails don't look 'bad' it's just not the look I was going for and if he would have let it go and not worn me down about doing gel, I would have been completely happy but he convinced me gel was better."}
{"text":"Ty was great - professional, friendly and talented. Plus with the deal from yelp, very affordable. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"tip: make appointments! i came in around lunch time on friday and it looked like they don't have a large staff to attend a walk-in if they have back-to-back appointments..  I am here in Cleveland for work, and found this place through yelp.  I had a set of acrylics on my nails for 3 weeks and i needed them off! I was planning to go back to natural nails--so no shellac or acrylic. just a mani and color. Johnny was my technician and he was really nice. he worked carefully to take off the acrylic nails as my nail beds were already thinned out from previous. cleaned up my nails and painted them really nicely. i haven't had regular nail polish in a long time so i gotta be careful as they don't dry nearly as quick as shellac."}
{"text":"This is the best nail salon I have ever visited in lol of NE Ohio. It is very clean, the technicians are excellent and are also very friendly and welcoming. I have never had such a great half moon manicure before. I highly recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Awesome job on my solar nails! I'm extremely pleased with the great job and attention to detail that was paid to my nails. It was worth the 20 minute drive to get the end results I was looking for. Thanks Ty :-)"}
{"text":"VERY NICE OWNER AND SALON - EXCELLENT RESULT! Here on extended business trip and couldn't stand to look at my overdue gels any longer!   I expect an extremely clean salon, appearance and sterilization practices. Aria meets those expectations. Made appt with owner Ty. I had the best time talking with him as he worked, joked and talked about The OC in CA , where we both live(d).  I decided on...french gels for hands and regular pedi.   French manis of any type can be a real challenge to make them look good, he did it effortlessly. Love the  OPI cure station. Was an interesting experience to walk out in 25* weather wearing sandals, then sloshing around for a couple of hours shopping sans heavy socks in my Storm Chasers to preserve his good work. However it worked like a charm! He asked if I would be returning before heading home. That answer is a definite YES.  And plan to schedule another appt on my next trip to Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I have used this salon twice during a visit to family in the area. It is clean and tidy and runs on time. I will return in the future."}
{"text":"I was a walk-in, was immediately acknowledged by the staff.  They have a TON of gel/shellac color options, which is great!  It's clean and spacious, plenty of stations.  My tech was very friendly, but since they were a little short on staff, it felt rushed.  My manicure turned out decent, but if she had spent a little more time I think it would have been better (more nail coverage).  Overall recommended, but suggest an appointment."}
{"text":"I get gel acrylics and have been to many nail salons in Parma area--this one so far is the best. Nice staff and good quality work at a fair price."}
{"text":"I judge a nail salon based on how well either my pedicure is done or how long my gel manicure lasts. Arias nails definitely meets my standards for  a gel manicure. I went in on a Thursday afternoon, and requested a gel manicure. I was set up with Johnny who was polite and very sweet. He chatted with me throughout and was just pleasant all around.   The manicure itself was great, they have a wide variety of colors to choose from, also an organized and clean store.   It's been exactly two weeks today and my nails look great, no chipping or peeling. I will be going back there this weekend and maybe try a pedi soon! :)   Pro: they speak fluent English Con: they charge tax on top of listed prices"}
{"text":"I went here on a whim because I really wanted to get my nails done. I was pleasantly surprised. The place was extremely clean and the owner was nice and professional. I loved the way that my nails came out and will definitely be back again. I've already started telling my friends about it because that's how excited I was about the finished product."}
{"text":"Would absolutely go back! Thai is very good and fun too! I got a gel full set and it's exactly how I wanted."}
{"text":"Best nail salon on the west side and the owner Uyen and her brother Johnny are the absolute best nail techs in Cleveland without a doubt. If I was in Cleveland this would be my first choice. Manicures and pedicures are top notch!"}
{"text":"I took a chance and came here for a full set and boy was pleased with the outcome of my nails. Wynn completed my pink and white full set in under 30 minutes. I was greeted by her when I first walked in the door and she made me feel so welcome. I spent 54.00 but it was so worth it. I'm willing to pay extra for good service and that's exactly what I received. I will return for a fill."}
{"text":"Super super !! Nice staff, high hygienic place :) never have problems with them !! It's my fifth manicure."}
{"text":"Mike, the owner, did my nails (full set gel acrylic). $38 plus tip... Nice guy. I am nail bitter, but he was able to work with my nails and make them look beautiful. He explained the process of growing my natural nails out under acrylic and then getting just gels. He did not make me embarrassed about my bad nail bitting habit, but was encouraging to help me fix the issue. I will be back."}
{"text":"Wynn did my nails and did an amazing job!!! She listened to what I wanted and worked her magic! I left feeling amazing. I highly recommend this salon and Wynn."}
{"text":"First time here-had my nails done by Johnny. He did a fantastic job; I had a spa pedi + mani done, and my nails looked fabulous when they were done. Would highly recommend; the nail techs were very pleasant and prices are comparable to other places that may not do as good of a job. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place! My nails never chip or break and acrylics last about 3 weeks! They are so fast too."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were visiting for a month to receive medical care at The Cleveland Clinic. We found Aria through the high reviews on Yelp! Well, they were all spot on...incredible skill, a kind heart and most of all we felt safe! The salon is tastefully decorated and the owner is a hard working and skilled artist!  Thanks for making our visit so great!"}
{"text":"I found Aria as a recommendation on Yelp and honestly everything was fantastic. I will admit, I've only gotten my nails done professionally three times total (including this visit). I got a gel full set with tips and gel polish, and honestly the whole experience was great.  I came in about 20 minutes early (for once, I overestimated traffic) and got there around 5:40 for a 6pm appointment. There was one other person there who was finishing her pedicure, but Ty got started with me as soon as she was done. I told him I didn't know exactly what a full set was but that I wanted one. He explained the lengths of the tips, what went into the process, and even showed me the solar nail powder which was what I ended up choosing. Ty was really personable and honest about the whole process. I also have the decision-making power of a rock, so even after we'd decided on a color, I went back and chose something completely different and he was really patient with me. I definitely want to go back to get my fills from him, and would highly recommend this salon to anyone."}
{"text":"I was torn as to whether to give them 4 or 5 stars, but rounded up for couple of reasons. First, they're definitely better than other places that I've given four stars, so I want to be fair. The manicure was a little bit better than average, and a bit on the expensive side, but they have a very wide color selection. The reason for the five stars was the pedicure which was the best I've had in a long time. I opted for the middle priced option, which was a little bit expensive, but they did a great job with the callous removal and the rest of the pedicure was extremely good as well. My only complaint is that the callous removal was a little bit uneven between feet, the right foot was cleaner than the left, but overall they did a great job. If I ever have a reason to come back to Cleveland, I'll definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Cost me around 50$ todo a fill and mood polish and to fix one nail. Looked at them and that shape was just all wrong some are coffin and some just look like square and I asked them to fix it and to him he did and he didn't what so ever. After a week my nails started to look dirty like top top of it looks black? Not sure what that happened Mabey didn't seal my acrylics right but it's just bad. My nail that he had to fix looks awful so uneven and not even lines in right. Will never be going back."}
{"text":"Seriously the owner does excellent nails! Had listened to me, did what I wanted and so far I'm pretty happy! Will continue to go to him. Ship was clean which was a plus!"}
{"text":"Saw this salon just driving down Broadview and checked out yelp to see how other's rated it and then decided to try!  It's very nice and clean inside and Tye (I may not have spelled that right), the owner, is extremely pleasant and did a wonderful job with my nails.  Shellac french on nails has lasted 4 weeks, and toes still look new. :) Great place and I will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"This shop is so convenient for me. They do a superb job, very artistic & neat. I generally see Johnny who is excellent!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new nail salon for awhile now, and when I saw Aria on Yelp I figured \"how can 22 people be wrong?\" And they definitely aren't!  Yesterday I stopped in for a manicure on my lunch and got an appointment with Wyn (not sure if the spelling is right). She is AWESOME. Not only did she do an awesome job, but she works quickly! She finished up in about 20 minutes without sacrificing quality. This is *super* important to me, because I like to schedule my nail appointments on my lunch.   The atmosphere at this nail salon is a lot more relaxing and nicely decorated than any salon I've been to in the area. It is a family owned business.   She did such a great job, that I called my mom and urged her to make an appointment for herself that day. She had a great experience as well!  The following day I came back on my lunch and got a pedicure in 30 minutes flat. She did an equally excellent job.   The prices for the manicures are ever so slightly higher than the competition, but the pedicures are cheaper than other area nail salons so it really equals out that you're getting a great deal and the quality is above and beyond and nail salon I've been to anywhere else in the greater Cleveland area.   Literally my only complaint is that my mom and I both loved Wyn's service and work so much that we can't get mani/pedis together anymore, because obviously she can't do two appointments at once! -- although she assured us that the other techs are just as great. Either way, we won't be going anywhere else other than Aria!!!"}
{"text":"Im in town visiting my family for the holidays. I decided to drop in for a no-chip mani and pedi. My service was fast. The job was well done. My only con was the price. It seemed extraordinarily expensive, and I'm used to Chicago prices! Maybe they charged me extra for taking off old polish? Either way, I guess it's my fault for not asking. I would come back."}
{"text":"Super job! Quick and precise! A very god experience for an out-of-towner that needed a fill quickly!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous!!! He was so friendly and creative. He will come up with ideas and ask if he can do them and is extremely open minded to doing designs and nail art, I'm so glad to finally find someone out here!!!"}
{"text":"Great nails, good prices and kind people!  Met up with a couple friends and we all had something different done with our nails. They got us all out of there in a timely fashion but made it so that we could enjoy ourselves and our nails. I will be back."}
{"text":"Exceptional services here! Love my pedi and shellac manicure. They do the best art designs so far. Highly recommend Johnny ;)"}
{"text":"Went to this salon based on the reviews on Yelp. I have gone back for a second time and and i strongly recommend going -great job was done on my nails. The owner listed to what I wanted and executed. Just go you won't regret it call and make an appointment if you can, but he is accommodating if you don't."}
